   The drug control strategy President Bush will
present next week will call for $250 million to $260 million in
economic and military aid for the three principal cocaine producing
countries _ Colombia, Peru and Bolivia _ an administration source
said Wednesday.
   Earlier, sources had said that aid figure could hit $300 million,
and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft indicated Tuesday that
the figure would be even higher than that.
   When asked about the reported $300 million figure for the Andean
countries, Scowcroft said, ``That figure, I think you can assume,
has already been increased by the fact that we have given Colombia
$65 million'' to help it fight the ``total war'' declared by the
drug traffickers there.
   However, the $65 million is coming out of a discretionary fund
available for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. The strategy covers
fiscal 1990.
   Scowcroft had not intended to add the $65 million onto next
year's budget, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   President Bush met with his top lieutenants in the drug war
Tuesday at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, to discuss the
strategy, but sources said Wednesday that the focus of the meeting
was Colombia, not the strategy, and that no specific decisions were
made on changing plans for future aid to that country.
   ``The fundamental issues of the strategy, Kennebunkport did not
change,'' one of the sources said, noting that the final strategy
had gone to the printer before the meeting took place. The source
declined to be named publicly.
   Colombia has suffered numerous bombings by drug traffickers since
Colombian President Virgilio Barco imposed emergency regulations 1{
weeks ago that allow for the immediate resumption of extraditions of
alleged drug traffickers to the United States for trial.
   Last Friday, Bush announced the United States would give Colombia
$65 million in military equipment such as helicopters, in addition
to some $2.5 million for protection for the Colombian judiciary that
had been promised previously. Congress last year set aside $5
million for such protection. Colombian Justice Minister Monica de
Greiff asked Tuesday for $19 million in aid for judicial protection.
   Mrs. de Greiff met for about 40 minutes Wednesday with William J.
Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy who
developed the draft strategy, said Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton.
   ``She expressed appreciation for what the United States was doing
and they agreed this was not a problem that was going to be solved
quickly,'' Hamilton said. ``She said that the Colombian government
was in it for the long haul and that she certainly hoped the United
States would continue its support.''
   Hamilton would not comment on the report that the strategy called
for a total of some $250 million to $260 million for Colombia, Peru
and Bolivia.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, on Wednesday proposed a plan to create ``debt-for-drugs''
swaps to help reduce coca cultivation.
   The plan calls for trading debt relief to governments in
coca-producing nations in exchange for their commitments to fund
specific crop substitution and coca eradication programs. Peru and
Bolivia are the chief coca-growing countries, while Colombia is the
main cocaine trafficking country, exporting about 80 percent of the
world's cocaine.
   The drug strategy, meanwhile, will urge states to impose tough
laws against drug users, but won't threaten to withhold highway
funds from those states that fail to do so, as the draft strategy
had proposed, an administration source said Wednesday.
   In addition, a proposed $25 million National Drug Intelligence
Center, to be run jointly by the Drug Enforcement Administration and
the FBI, was eliminated from the strategy due to a last-minute bid
by the Treasury Department to develop a money-laundering
intelligence center and combine all the elements, the source said.
The Justice Department objected to the sudden change of plans.
   The New York Times, quoting White House sources in its Thursday
editions, reported that the plan will focus on arresting
middle-level figures like pilots, couriers and money handlers.
Although the government has been trying for years to identify and
arrest middle-level workers, it has not concentrated resources in
this area, the Times said.
   The officials said the effort would be a major change from the
current emphasis on going after the leaders of international drug
organizations, by trying to seize drugs at the border and by
eradicating coca leaf cultivation.
   However, most of the elements included in the draft strategy _
the emphasis on targeting drug abusers who fuel the drug traffic,
the hiking of funds for drug treatment by 49 percent and the need
for massively increased aid to the Andean countries _ remain the
same as proposed originally by Bennett, the source said.
   In Kennebunkport on Wednesday, the vacation White House press
office announced that a new program allowing judges to strip student
loans and other federal benefits from drug offenders starts Friday.
   The vacationing President Bush sent Congress a report on
Wednesday spelling out how the penalties will work in both state and
federal courts.
   Those convicted of drug trafficking or possession can be denied
federal grants, student loans, contracts, and professional and
commercial licenses, but not welfare, disability or Social Security
benefits.
   The decision to deny any or all of an individual's benefits rests
solely with the sentencing judge, except for those convicted of a
third drug trafficking offense. For them, permanent denial of the
benefits is mandatory.
   The penalties can be applied to convictions occurring after
Friday for offenses occurring on or after Nov. 18, 1988.
   Next Tuesday, Bush will go on radio and television to describe
his new national drug strategy that is expected to stiffen penalties
for individual users.

<HEAD>China Acts To Reassert Controls Over Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official press reported Thursday that the
government is taking new steps to re-establish order in an economy
reeling from speculation and profiteering in scarce materials and
widespread tax evasion.
   The steps include measures to reassert controls over the
distribution and pricing of raw materials such as coal and steel,
the reports said.
   The state will also begin a campaign against what it says is
rampant tax evasion among China's 14.5 million privately owned
enterprises, the China Daily reported.
   Xie Mingan, an official of the Ministry of Materials and
Equipment, said the state will tighten controls on prices of some
raw materials such as coal, rolled steel and non-ferrous metals.
   He said redundant middlemen will be eliminated, illegal dealers
and officials trading power for money will be disciplined and state
supplies of materials to production enterprises will be maintained.
   One aspect of the economic reforms _ decentralization of controls
over raw materials _ has led to hoarding, speculation and
price-gouging. Middlemen, often with links to influential party and
government officials, buy up scarce materials at low government-set
prices and sell them for huge profits on free markets.
   Jin Xin, director of the State Tax Administration, told a
conference Wednesday that if the problem of tax evasion among
private businessmen goes unsolved, ``it will certainly sap the
morale of the dominant working classes and bring adverse effects on
the enthusiasm of intellectuals.''
   China's conservative leadership has singled out private
entrepreneurs as an example of unhealthy disparities in income
levels. Many private businessmen, some operating from simple street
stalls, earn more in a day than a worker or teacher makes in a
month. A young worker earns about $27 a month.
   Jin said the state was not trying to add to the financial burdens
of private businessmen, who have been a stimulus in China's economic
growth over the past decade.
   He also promised no change in the preferential terms on taxation
for foreign investors in China.
   The Central Committee of the National People's Congress, China's
parliament, was also told Wednesday that more than 2,800 companies
lost their business licenses and nearly 800 party and government
officials were punished after the government began a drive against
shady business practices in October.
   The moves come against the backdrop of a return to Marxist
orthodoxy in the political sphere following the military crackdown
on the pro-democracy movement in June and a general reassessment of
the pace of the nation's market-oriented economic reforms.

<TEXT>
   A man convicted of the 1977 rape and murder
of a 61-year-old woman was executed Wednesday night in Virginia's
electric chair.
   Alton Waye, 34, was pronounced dead at 11:05 p.m. after receiving
two 55-second jolts of nearly 2,500 volts of electricity, said
Department of Corrections spokesman Wayne J. Farrar.
   ``I would express that what is about to take place is a murder,''
Waye said in a final statement. ``I don't hate anyone. I forgive
everyone involved.''
   Waye went to the U.S. Supreme Court earlier Wednesday seeking a
stay of execution, but the high court refused by a 7-2 vote to
postpone the execution and to consider his case on appeal.
   Waye, a former textile worker, also was denied clemency earlier
Wednesday by Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.
   Amnesty International has said Waye should not be executed
because he is borderline mentally retarded. Baliles has received 638
letters opposing the execution, largely due to a letter campaign
urged by the human rights group.
   Baliles, in letters Wednesday to Waye's attorneys, said he had
reviewed Waye's case and ``I am not persuaded that the governor's
power of executive clemency should be exercised in this matter.''
   Waye received communion of bread and juice Wednesday night from a
boyhood schoolmate, the Rev. William Bell, and the Revs. Russ Ford
and A.C. Epps.
   John Coble, operations officer at the State Penitentiary, said
Waye was baptized Tuesday night. ``He said to tell the people, `I am
blessed,''' Coble said.
   ``He's relying on his religious faith at this time,'' Coble said.
``He's savoring the time he has with his family.'' Waye's mother,
brother, two sisters and other relatives visited him Wednesday.
   Waye was the eighth person to die in Virginia's electric chair
since the state reinstituted the death penalty in 1977, and the
117th executed in the United States since the Supreme Court's 1976
allowing reinstatement of capital punishment.
   Earlier Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige denied a
stay of execution based on claims of Waye's diminished mental
capacity. Monday he denied a stay on claims that the trial jury was
given faulty instructions.
   Merhige's rulings were upheld Wednesday afternoon by a
three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which
heard arguments via conference call, said Bert Rohrer, a spokesman
for Attorney General Mary Sue Terry.
   Waye's attorneys contended the condemned man should be spared the
death penalty because of new evidence showing he has ``a very
seriously damaged brain.''
   Richard H. Burr, a lawyer from the NAACP Legal and Educational
Defense Fund in New York, told the appeals panel Waye was deprived
of an adequate psyciatric evaluation when he was tried in 1978. He
also said Waye's previous attorneys failed to adequately investigate
Waye's psychiatric condition.
   Deputy Attorney General Linwood Wells argued that the defense was
legally barred from raising such objections, which should have been
raised at trial or in earlier appeals.
   Waye was convicted of the Oct. 14, 1977, rape and murder of
Lavergne B. Marshall, whose nude body was found in a bathtub. Her
face was beaten beyond recognition, and she had been stabbed 42
times with a butcher knife. The killer had poured laundry bleach on
the body.
   Shortly after the killing, a man who identified himself as Waye
called police to tell them he had killed a woman, according to trial
testimony. Police picked up Waye at his home and said he led them to
the farm house where Mrs. Marshall lived alone.
   Waye's court-appointed attorney, William L. Wellons of Victoria,
did not dispute that Waye committed the crime. However, he pleaded
for a verdict on a lesser charge than capital murder.
   Waye could be the last person executed in Richmond. The State
Penitentiary is scheduled to close by June 30, 1990, and the
electric chair will be moved to a new prison in Greensville County.

   Tropical Storm Gabrielle formed late Wednesday off
the West African coast with top winds of 40 mph, becoming the
seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, forecasters
said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of Gabrielle was near latitude 11.0
north and longitude 25.8 west, or about 435 miles southwest of the
Cape Verde Islands.
   The storm, heading west at 20 mph, was expected to strengthen
over the next day, according to the National Hurricane Center in
suburban Coral Gables.
   The storm formed less than a day after its predecessor, Felix,
dwindled to a tropical depression. It carried winds of 30 mph
Wednesday night and was centered about 920 miles south of the
westernmost Azores in the north Atlantic.
   A depression becomes a tropical storm when its winds reach 39
mph. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane once its winds hit 74 mph.
There have been three hurricanes so far during the hurricane season,
which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<HEAD>Funeral Service For Slain Man, TV Crew Attacked In Aftermath of Rioting</HEAD>

   Funeral services were held Wednesday for a
black man whose shooting death by police sparked two days of rioting
and looting in Vineland while a special panel convened on how to
calm racial tensions.
   Community leaders had hoped the unrest following the Sunday night
shooting had subsided, but four people were arrested Wednesday,
including a man who scuffled with a television news crew, said Lee
Tofanelli, a city spokesman.
   The WPVI-TV news crew from Philadelphia was attacked by a group
of youths as they interviewed people in downtown Vineland, where
rioting and looting broke out Monday night, Tofanelli said.
   News reporter Dann Cuellar was listed in stable condition at
Newcomb Medical Center in Vineland with a broken nose and facial
injuries, hospital officials said. A cameraman and sound technician
were treated for minor injuries and discharged.
   ``I feel no animosity toward those youngsters out there,''
Cuellar said in a telehone interview. ``There is a lot of
frustration ... a lot of anger here.''
   Cuellar's wallet and some television equipment were stolen. The
equipment was returned later, Tofanelli said.
   Allen Fleming, 23, was arrested on assault and robbery charges,
Tofanelli said, and three other people were arrested in a separate
incident when they disobeyed police orders to leave the area. The
charges were not available.
   About 200 people packed into Truth Baptist Church in Newfield for
a two-hour ceremony in remembrance of 26-year-old Samuel Williams,
who was shot and killed by Vineland police on Sunday.
   Mayor Harry Curley met with community leaders and announced the
formation of an eight-member special task force to find ways of
restoring calm to the city.
   ``We're hoping this will be the first step,'' Curley said at an
informal press conference at his City Hall office. ``We're hoping
that we can be assured there won't be any more outbreaks.''
   Samuel Clark, president of the local chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, thought the
unrest would end with the memorial service.
   ``They're grieving, but I don't think it's going to be a
destructive type of thing,'' Clark said.
   Mourners gathered outside the small white church in Newfield,
about several miles north of Vineland, as the coffee-colored casket
containing Williams' body was led to a black hearse.
   They raised clenched fists in a symbol of black power as a choir
sang ``Oh How I Love Jesus.''
   Williams' body was taken to a funeral home and then to the state
medical examiner's office in Newark for a second autopsy. An initial
autopsy was performed Monday by the county coroner.
   Williams, a father of two children, was shot after he allegedly
threatened officer Paul Letizia with a steel rod, said police Chief
Joseph Cassisi.
   Williams, who was wanted on drug and weapons charges, was spotted
by officers after police received an anonymous telephone call about
a man on a bicycle carrying drugs, Cassisi said.
   After being told he was under arrest, Williams picked up the rod
and approached Letizia, swinging, Cassisi said. Letizia, who is
white, fired two shots at Williams, hitting him both times, the
police chief said.
   Curley said Letizia has been taken off street duty and put on
special assignment. The mayor said he did not plan to follow the
demands of some blacks who want Letizia suspended without pay
pending the outcome of an investigation by the state Attorney
General's office.
   Curley said the task force would review the police department's
relationship with the mostly minority community as well as the
handling of citizen complaints. He said a report was expected in
about 30 days.

   Killings in the District of Columbia,
continuing at a record pace that police say is largely driven by a
burgeoning drug trade, has passed the 300 mark for the year.
   The city's 300th homicide victim, recorded early Tuesday, was a
suburban Maryland man gunned down in a northwest Washington drug
market, police said.
   At least 10 people were shot or stabbed in the city Tuesday,
police said, and three died.
   One woman was seriously injured by a stray bullet as she stood
outside her northest Washington home.
   The deaths bring the district's 1989 homicide count to 301,
compared to 216 at this time last year. The city's homicide record
of 372 was set last year.
   Police say about 60 percent of the city's killings are related to
drugs. Drug-related violence has also hiked the murder rate in
Washington's suburbs, according to police.
   Twelve people have been killed so far this year in Montgomery
County, Md., compared to nine at this time last year. In Prince
George's County, Md., 77 people have been killed this year, compared
to 53 at this time in 1988.
   Fairfax County, Va., has had 19 killings this year, compared to
12 last year, and Alexandria, Va., has eight compared to three last
year.

   Michigan officials are hoping to boost tourism by
telling Sun Belt residents that summers are better in the Sweat Belt.
   The Michigan Travel Bureau plans to spend $250,000 on advertising
in cities along Interstate 75, which ends in southern Florida,
spokeswoman Sue Wagner said. The ads will target Florida, she said.
   ``We know there are a lot of Floridians who went to school in
Michigan, worked in Michigan, have family in Michigan. They're our
main target,'' bureau director John Savich said Tuesday.
   ``If we can get the average Floridian who by July has had months
of hot, muggy weather, we'll be happy to get them, too,'' he said.
   Tourism is Michigan's second-largest industry following
manufacturing, worth $16 billion a year. Most tourists come from the
Great Lakes region, though. Michigan wants to become a national
tourism draw.
   The ads will use themes like, ``Come up to the cool Michigan
summers,'' Wagner said. The campaign also will stress festivals,
golfing and other outdoor activities, she said.
   ``We referred to it as the Sweat Belt'' in brain-storming
sessions, Wagner said.
   Raphael Marcucci of the Florida Department of Commerce said he
wasn't worried about the competition.
   ``A beach on a Great Lake'' isn't the same as one on the Atlantic
Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico, he said in a telephone interview from
Tallahassee.

   Call it the ``wheel of misfortune.''
That's what a woman feels about the popular television game show
after receiving prizes she says were used, filthy and damaged.
   ``I just wanted to go on `Wheel of Fortune' and have a good
time,'' said Debra Stuker, 30, who appeared on the show 15 months
ago. ``And I did have a good time _ it was a lot of fun.
   ``Now, all the problems have kind of ruined it.''
   Mrs. Stuker said her winnings included a $4,200 jukebox that
arrived at her northern Illinois home used, dirty and with parts
missing.
   She also said the sparkling $10,000 blue canopied dinghy she
picked out turned up with a broken windshield, cracks in the
fiberglass, splotches of tar on the hull and dirty, torn upholstery.
   A representative of the Merv Griffin Enterprises show said
officials are working on the complaints. The representative declined
to give her name.
   Mrs. Stuker was the show's big winner for two days, garnering
$36,829 worth of prizes including a Jeep, a sailboat, a small
motorboat, artwork, sportswear and sporting equipment.
   She and her husband, Michael, forfeited some items they didn't
want, but still got hit for $1,300 in federal and California state
taxes on the prizes.
   ``We got the Jeep, and it was nice _ we traded it in for a van,''
Stuker said. ``We got the TV and the VCR and some other nice
things.''
   But then the jukebox and the boat arrived. The couple's lawyer,
Al Williams, has a file of letters indicating the Stukers' repeated
attempts to have the problem corrected.
   The Stukers refused the game show's offer of $2,500 in cash in
lieu of the $4,200 jukebox. The show took back the boat but hasn't
offered a replacement.
   ``We don't want to be greedy but anybody in their right mind
would want this stuff if they had it coming to them,'' Stuker said.

   The last Rhode Island beach closed by an
oil spill in June was prepared for reopening today as state crews
plowed oil-soaked sand.
   Mackerel Cove in Jamestown had been closed since the June 23
accident involving the Greek tanker World Prodigy. The tanker
spilled about 300,000 gallons of home heating oil into Rhode Island
Sound when it ran aground at Brenton Reef, about a mile south of
Newport and five miles from Mackerel Cove.
   The spill caused most Rhode Island beaches to be closed about a
week, but Mackerel Cove, the hardest-hit of the beaches, remained
closed because oil had soaked into the sand.
   State environmental workers have been harrowing the sand to
expose the oil to air so it can evaporate. The department decided to
bulldoze the rest of the contaminated sand instead of turning it
because it is now a manageable amount, said spokeswoman Fran
Segerson.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Fish 14, President Bush 0</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The vacation was 14 days old and the
standings were: Fish-14, President Bush-0. The presidential patience
appeared to be wearing thin.
   Sure he was worried about the drug lords in Colombia and the
civil war in Lebanon. But the other thing bugging Bush as he relaxed
on the coast of Maine was why the heck couldn't he catch a fish.
   Despite daily excursions in his speedboat Fidelity _ sometimes
twice daily _ to ply the ocean off his seaside home, the president
failed to reel one in.
   He tried all kinds of lures and a variety of fishing partners _
from grandchildren to visiting dignitaries _ but still came up with
an empty line.
   He canceled an afternoon of golf Sunday in favor of a fishing
jaunt, and on Monday morning decided to forgo his 6:30 a.m. jog to
try again.
   On the advice of longtime fishing buddy Bob Boilard the president
even ordered the Secret Service to keep extraneous boats, including
the small flotilla of press chase boats, 500 feet away on the theory
that the vessels might be scaring off the fish.
   Still no luck.
   Bush tried not to show dismay, and Barbara Bush claimed the
president wasn't bothered a bit. But there were signs it was getting
to be something of a sore subject.
   ``The fishing's been lousy,'' he confided to reporters at the end
of the first fishless week. ``I fish every single day and haven't
got one.''
   Eventually there were inklings of a Hemingwayesque obsession, as
he talked of having a ``rendezvous with bluefish.'' He laid down a
decree: ``I guarantee there will be fish caught.''
   When he learned that an 18-pounder was caught off one of the TV
crew boats tailing Fidelity, he could barely contain his envy.
   ``Eighteen pound bluefish?'' he repeated several times. ``Out
there with us? There's no justice here. That's just not fair.''
   Meanwhile, word was spreading fast about the fishless vacation.
   The Portland Press Herald came out with a front page graphic
called Fish Watch, featuring a picture of a circled fish with a line
drawn across it and the statistics on how many days Bush has fished
without a catch.
   When Bush piloted his boat into town one day, a local fisherman
gave him a large fish, and Bush grudgingly agreed with the press
corps that this seemed the only way he could hook one.
   Evangelist Billy Graham, Bush's weekend house guest, told a local
church congregation the president took him along on a fishing trip
as a Jonah, a reference to the biblical figure who was swallowed by
a whale.
   The president laughed and nodded when a reporter asked if he
would have Graham bless his fishing rods.
   Bush has previously espoused a philosophical viewpoint on
fish-free vacations, saying the fun was more in the fishing than the
catching.
   But this trip, the situation seemed a bit much to take.
   By Monday both the president and his staff were trying to put the
best face on his bad luck streak.
   That morning presidential photographer David Valdez caught six
fish on the president's boat and National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft caught one that he described by extending his hands about
two feet.
   White House spokesman Bruce Zanca later said diplomatically,
``Under the president's careful tutelage, the fishing trip was
successful ... The fish were caught under his strong leadership.''
   When reporters came upon him later at the golf course, the
president also took the cheery tack.
   ``We did it today,'' he said.
   But when asked if ``we'' meant he too had caught a fish, he
quipped, ``I was so busy trying to make General Scowcroft feel at
home there ... we did well today.''
   By the time Scowcroft finished beating his boss at golf, a game
Bush has vowed to improve on this vacation, Bush was directing all
questions about golf and fishing to him.
   ``Brent, they want to talk to you about this. I'm too grumpy,''
he said before darting off in his golf cart.

   Shoppers at the biggest supermarket chain in
the Baltimore-Washington area are accustomed to getting advice from
Odonna Mathews, whether they want it or not.
   She is the consumers' ombudsman, advocate and confidante at Giant
Foods, and what's good for customers turns out to be good, too, for
the prospering chain, the country's 12th largest supermarket company.
   Twenty thousand times a year, customers write or call Mrs.
Mathews to ask for a recipe, to request that stores stock an old
familiar brand or to complain about the checkout clerk who put the
eggs at the bottom of the bag.
   When Giant started selling live lobsters, two customers asked for
a merciful way to cook the crustaceans.
   Mrs. Mathews consulted animal rights people, the National
Aquarium and the fish industry and wrote into a guidebook two
alternative methods _ severing the spinal cord or starting out with
cool water. The experts said lobsters feel less pain than when they
are plunged into boiling water.
   On Giant's commercials, Mrs. Mathews brims with advice. She tells
how to combat cholesterol, compare costs of different brands or opt
for healthful snacks (``choose pretzels, plain or fruit-filled
shredded wheat or matzo.'')
   ``Lower The Fat,'' urges a sign over the stores' meat counters.
``Choose chicken. Remove the skin. Eat more white meat than dark.''
   On the shelves, green arrows point out foods that are high in
fiber or low in fat and cholesterol.
   Three ounces of meat in a serving is really enough, Mrs. Mathews
advises budget-minded shoppers. ``Slice the meat thinly and fan it
out on the plate.''
   ``Everyone in the Washington area can tell you who Odonna is,''
says Lou Garcia of the Society of Consumer Affairs Professionals,
which represents 1,000 firms that employ consumer advisers. ``Not
many of them have her kind of recognition.''
   The only woman among 22 Giant vice presidents, Mrs. Mathews says
she is free ``to openly disagree with company policies when they are
not in the consumers' best interest.''
   She pestered Giant's bakers until they finally agreed to forswear
highly saturated palm and coconut oils in baked goods, except for in
whipped toppings _ and she's working on those.
   ``Some people think I'm a pain in the neck,'' she says. ``If I
am, I'm doing my job.''
   Another idea came from Giant's consumer board, on which customers
volunteer to serve. At their urging, she pressed Giant to create one
checkout lane in each store with no candy to tempt kiddies. The
chocolate industry protested in vain, she says.
   In an interview in Giant's nothing-fancy corporate headquarters
in a warehouse neighborhood outside Washington, Mrs. Mathews spells
out her philosophy:
   ``People are going to eat their hot dogs and their chocolate
chips. But choices should be there. Consumers have the right to
choose, and they have the right to be informed.''
   A native of Washington, she started as an intern to the company's
first consumer adviser, Esther Peterson, who also served as consumer
adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Carter.
   ``Giant was ahead of the curve,'' says Guy Ford, who analyzes
supermarket stocks for Investment Corp. of Norfolk, Va. ``The
industry is just coming around to what Giant's been doing for
years.''
   The Food Marketing Institute says a third of 164 retailers who
took part in a 1987 survey have consumer affairs departments. Forty
percent of the consumer advisers report to top management.
   Analyst Kimberly Walin of Prudential Bache notes that what Mrs.
Mathews does is also good business. ``The costs are not that high
and the goodwill between Giant and the community is great,'' she
says.
   With 147 stores, Giant enjoys net profit margins of over 3
percent of sales _ well above the industry average of 0.71 percent.
Giant's sales, near $3 billion a year, have doubled in eight years.

<HEAD>Grand Canyon Pollution Pits Federal Agency Against Federal Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal agencies contend that a large
Arizona power plant, partly owned by another government agency, is
polluting the skies over the Grand Canyon.
   But the operator of the plant, one of the nation's largest
coal-burning electric facilities, criticizes the National Park
Service study.
   ``We designed and built the Navajo Generating Station to meet all
air-quality standards,'' said A.J. ``Jack'' Pfister, general manager
of the Salt River Project, which operates the plant near Page, Ariz.
   ``The plant was located to assure that emissions would blow away
from the Grand Canyon,'' he said Tuesday.
   The controversy pits the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Park Service against the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which owns
24.3 percent of the plant and would be responsible for much of the
cost of expensive pollution controls.
   Costs estimates to control the pollution range from $300 million
to $1 billion.
   The government has tried for years to determine to what extent
the plant, 80 miles from the center of the Grand Canyon, is
responsible for the layers of haze and pollution that cloud the
skies during certain times of the year.
   The Park Service defends its $2 million study tracking the
plant's pollution and favors strong curbs. But the Bureau of
Reclamation sides with plant operators who argue the plant shouldn't
be singled out for expensive pollution controls.
   Both agencies are part of the Interior Department.
   Interior Secretary Manual Lujan said Tuesday he wasn't prepared
to accept the Park Service conclusions, suggesting the National
Academy of Sciences conduct a review. That suggestion was widely
seen as giving the Bureau of Reclamation the upper hand.
   The EPA said Tuesday that pollution from the 2,250-megawatt plant
``is a significant contributor to visibility impairment'' at the
canyon.
   The EPA relied heavily on last year's six-week Park Service
study, in which plant pollutants were traced using a specially
colored chemical.
   The Park Service said that during the study, an average 40
percent of the pollution could be traced to the plant, and that the
figure reached 70 percent on some days.
   ``We have substantial evidence that the Navajo Generating Station
is a significant contributor to the visibility problem,'' said F.
Henry Habicht, EPA deputy administrator. ``Action must be taken now
to protect the Grand Canyon.''
   The EPA said it would determine by February how sharp a reduction
in sulfur dioxide emissions will be required. Curbs could force the
plant to install expensive ``scrubbers'' or other technology.
   Pfister said he would go to court to stop any attempt to require
installation of expensive pollution controls.
   The Salt River Project has put the possible cost as high as $1
billion, although other estimates are in the $300 million to $400
million range.
   About one-fourth of the bill could be sent to the government
because of the Bureau of Reclamation's partial ownership. The agency
uses its electricity to pump water from the Colorado River to an
irrigation project in central Arizona.
   The plant burns 24,000 tons of coal a day and releases an
estimated 12 tons to 13 tons of sulfur dioxide from its 750-foot
smokestacks hourly.
   Plant operators contend much of the pollution comes from other
sources, including the Los Angeles freeways, and that a number of
studies have shown that the plant isn't responsible for the canyon's
visibility problems.
   Bob Yuhnke, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, and
other environmentalists say they fear Lujan and the Office of
Management and Budget will try to pressure EPA Administrator William
Reilly into seeking only modest emission curbs because of the
potential cost to the federal government.
   In addition to the Interior Department, other owners of the plant
are the Salt River Project, 22 percent; Arizona Public Service Co.,
14 percent; the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 21
percent; the Nevada Power Co., 11 percent; and Tucson Electric Power
Co., 8 percent.

<HEAD>HUD Kills Project OK'd By Pierce in Final Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal housing officials are refusing to fund
a project approved over agency officials' objections by former
Secretary Samuel Pierce in his final days on the job, a source says.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development told One America
Inc. early this month it will not honor Pierce's decision to fund a
project to develop a computerized listing of black entrepreneurs,
said a HUD source who spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity.
   One America, a Maryland-based company owned by a prominent black
Republican couple, had requested $421,000 for the project. Pierce
approved half of that Jan. 17, three days before he left HUD after
heading the agency for eight years.
   Pierce's approval came despite a 6-1 vote against the proposal by
a HUD review committee, which questioned the need for the listing.
   Pierce approved the funding through a technical assistance
program over which he had authority, including the right to overrule
objections from others in the agency. But his action appears at odds
with sworn congressional testimony that he took no direct role in
funding decisions.
   Pierce is scheduled to be the first witness when congressional
hearings into influence-peddling, mismanagement and possible fraud
at HUD during the Reagan administration resume Sept. 15.
   HUD can halt the project despite Pierce's approval because the
department never entered into a contract with One America.
   ``Since there's no contract, we don't need a reason to kill it,''
said the source. The One America project had been put on hold by new
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp.
   Attempts to reach One America officials late Tuesday were
unsuccessful. The telephone at the company was not answered.
   The company is owned by Elaine and Howard Jenkins. During the
early 1980s, Mrs. Jenkins headed a group of black Republicans known
as the Council of 100 and also served on a White House commission on
small business.
   Jenkins is a former Labor Department official and was the first
black to serve on the National Labor Relations Board.
   Mrs. Jenkins, in an interview with The Associated Press in July,
said she had not received any special treatment from the agency.
   Pierce has not returned calls seeking comment.
   In a recent interview with The Los Angeles Times, Pierce said
that getting more blacks involved in HUD programs was one of his
greatest achievements at the agency but said politics played no part
in his decisions.
   ``A lot of blacks got business and we certainly didn't ask them
were they Republicans, Democrat, liberal or what,'' Pierce said.

   A prescription that costs $28 in one community
could sell for $2 in another, according to a private survey of drug
prices that found wide variations nationally and even within
communities.
   The American Association of Retired Persons said Tuesday that its
survey found that prices differed by factors of up to 14-to-1
nationally and that costs typically vary by more than 25 percent
from one pharmacy to another in the same town.
   Even bigger price differences were found between some brand-name
medications and their generic substitutes, which on average cost
half as much, the AARP said.
   One pharmacy had the city's highest cost, $36, for a brand name
and the lowest, $9.75, for the generic.
   The findings confirm the wisdom of shopping around, and are
especially important for older Americans, who account for 12 percent
of the population but use 32 percent of all prescription drugs, AARP
said.
   ``It was possible that an older consumer could save more than $30
on a single prescription,'' the report said.
   ``For example, in one community a prescription for Procardia
(heart medication) sold for $26.99 at one pharmacy and for $58.60 at
another pharmacy in the area.''
   The findings also have important implications for government and
private health insurance programs, which could hold down spiraling
costs by making sure beneficiaries get the lowest-priced
medications, AARP said.
   The 42-state survey also looked at services offered by pharmacies
and found somewhat higher drug costs at outlets that have special
programs such as 24-hour operations, after-hour emergency service,
free delivery, patient drug profiles and discounts.
   ``Since for many older consumers, these services can be as
important as cost savings, and since many offered them `at no
additional cost,' consumers should ask about the services and any
associated costs,'' the AARP said.
   The group used older volunteers to survey prices at 1,050
pharmacies between September 1987 and September 1988. The resulting
study, which didn't identify specific towns or pharmacies, examined
price differences among 165 communities on 15 drugs often prescribed
to older Americans.
   While the pharmacies surveyed were not scientifically selected,
the true range of prices cannot be less than those found in the
study, AARP said.
   The report said there were large state-to-state differences in
drug costs, with Hawaii and Alaska having the highest overall
average prices and Florida the lowest, but AARP could not
immediately provide actual figures for the states.
   There were big differences within states as well.
   In New York, for example, the price for Dyazide, a medication for
high blood pressure and extra fluid in the body, varied from $20 to
$45 in six communities. In Pennsylvania, one pharmacy had an average
price of $15.88 for certain drugs surveyed while another had an
average of $31.36.
   Drugs included in the survey were: Dyazide; Procardia; Slow-K and
its generic, potassium chloride TR, used to treat the need for more
potassium; Hydrodiuril and its generic, hydrochlorothiazide, for
high blood pressure and extra fluid in the body; Isordil and its
generic, isosorbide, for chest pain; Cardizem, chest pain; Lasix,
and its generic, furosemide, for high blood pressure and extra
fluid; Tenormin, high blood pressure; Inderal and its generic,
propranolol, for high blood pressure and chest pain; and Tagamet,
ulcers.
   The survey did not include Idaho, Maine, Nevada, Oklahoma, Rhode
Island, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming or the District of Columbia.

<HEAD>Bush's Anti-Drug Strategy Focusing More on South America</HEAD>

   President Bush's new drug strategy is being
adjusted to focus more U.S. aid on Colombia and two other South
American nations that are fighting cocaine cartels in the region.
   The crisis in Colombia, with seven bombings Tuesday in the city
of Medellin, was high on the agenda when the president met with top
Cabinet officials at his Maine seaside retreat to complete the new
anti-drug strategy to be unveiled next week.
   Bush promised ``to cooperate to the best of our ability'' with
Colombia's latest request for $19 million to protect judges from
drug cartel death squads.
   He did not comment specifically on the request but said details
were being worked out in discussions in Washington with a delegation
of Colombian officials headed by Justice Minister Monica de Greiff.
   Because of the crisis there, ``Colombia is a new ingredient in
the overall drug strategy,'' national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft told reporters in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   In Washington, Mrs. de Greiff told reporters ``the law is under
siege in Colombia and we must protect it every way we can.''
   ``We must uphold the rule of law, and regrettably at this moment
that requires intensive physical protection of our judges,'' said
Mrs. de Greiff, her country's eighth justice minister in three years.
   The 32-year-old lawyer denied reports she had considered
resigning in the face of death threats against her family, saying:
``The threats are out there, but I am satisfied with my protection
right now. I am determined that the integrity of our justice system
survives this crisis and I hope to play my full part in assuring
this.''
   Meanwhile, the State Department recommended Tuesday that
Americans postpone non-essential travel to Colombia indefinitely and
suggested that U.S. citizens living there consider leaving.
   ``Although Americans have not yet been the target of any
violence, visitors and Americans resident in Colombia should
carefully re-evaluate whether it is essential that they travel to or
remain in Colombia at this time,'' said the statement. ``The
department believes it would be prudent for those who deem their
presence non-essential to seriously consider leaving.''
   Asked about reports that the anti-drug proposal will include $300
million for Bolivia, Peru and Colombia, Scowcroft indicated it will
contain an ``Andean strategy'' to help these countries improve drug
interdiction.
   He said the aid package was adjusted upward to include the $65
million that Bush announced last week for the Colombian armed forces.
   Mrs. de Greiff said the additional $19 million she sought would
be used to buy armored cars, metal detectors and other security
equipment to protect judges.
   The Bush administration has already promised $5 million over two
years to train Colombian security guards to protect the judges.
   ``While training and other such programs are useful, we also need
to channel resources into such items as bulletproof cars (and) metal
detectors,'' she said.
   The Defense Department said it is ready to airlift military
equipment to Colombia under the $65 million aid package as soon as
it receives a list of materiel requested by Bogota.
   The crisis prompted cancellation of today's Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing on Colombia.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., scratched the hearing after the
Justice Department expressed fear that publicity would further
jeopardize the lives of Colombian authorities.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the panel was told
that ``because of the sensitive nature of the situation in Colombia
at this time that it would not be appropriate to have an open
hearing.''
   Runkel indicated that a review of emergency extradition decrees
by the Colombian Supreme Court could delay U.S. efforts to get
custody of Eduardo Martinez Ramirez, who is wanted on
money-laundering charges.
   But he said ``we have every hope and expectation of getting
custody of Mr. Ramirez.''
   The Justice Department is seeking to extradite Martinez under
emergency extradition decrees promulgated this month.
   Extradition papers are being prepared for 12 other Colombians
under federal indictment, Runkel said, ``so that when someone is
captured we would be in a position to have everything signed, sealed
and delivered to the United States.''

<HEAD>ABC's `Roseanne' Eases NBC's `Cheers' Out of First Place</HEAD>

   ABC's ``Roseanne'' took first place last week
in the Nielsen ratings, switching places with NBC's ``Cheers'' in
their summer seesaw rivalry as sitcoms dominated prime-time viewing.
   Eighteen of the 20 highest rated shows were comedies. The only
non-comedies were the movie pilot for NBC's ``Baywatch,'' tied for
seventh, and the CBS movie ``Tricks of the Trade,'' in 12th place.
   Roseanne Barr's sitcom in which she and John Goodman play a
working class couple was the success story of this past season.
Another working class couple, Al and Peg Bundy of Fox Broadcasting's
``Married...With Children,'' also have done well this summer.
   That show, which stars Ed O'Neill and Katey Sagal, finished ahead
of all network competition this past Sunday, and tied for 17th place
with NBC's ``Empty Nest.'' Its 13.4 rating is the highest ever for a
Fox show.
   The Fox show and ABC's ``20-20'' were the only original
productions in the top 30 for last week.
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey for the 62nd
consecutive week with an average rating of 11.4. ABC had 9.7 and CBS
9.6.
   NBC was first for the season to date from Sept. 19, with 14.5, to
ABC's 11.7 and CBS' 11.6.
   Each rating point is the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million
homes with televisions in the United States.
   This summer, Fox made its first ratings breakthrough after a long
period at the bottom of the ratings. Shows such as ``Married...With
Children,'' ``America's Most Wanted'' and ``Totally Hidden Video''
have all climbed out of the cellar.
   Fox's ``Open House,'' a new version of ``Duet,'' made its debut
last week in 47th place, ahead of the second part of the ABC Sunday
movie, ``The Gladiator.''
   Here are last week's top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's
``Cheers,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show''
and ``Dear John'' tied, ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' NBC's
``Baywatch: Panic at Malibu'' and ABC's ``Who's the Boss?'' tied,
ABC's ``Mr. Belvedere,'' NBC's ``Night Court.''
   CBS had only three shows in the first 20: ``Tricks of the
Trade,'' ``Designing Women'' 13th and ``Murphy Brown'' 14th.
   The NBC summer comedy ``FM'' dropped from its fifth place
premiere to 37th for a tie with CBS' ``Newhart.''
   NBC's occasional magazine show, ``Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow,''
was 32nd. ABC's weekly ``PrimeTime Live'' was 46th.
   ``The CBS Evening News'' was first among the evening news shows
with a rating of 9.7. ABC had an 8.5 and NBC 8.0.

<HEAD>Judge Requires Labeling Rules by Oct. 30</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has until Oct.
30 to issue rules on tampon labeling aimed at preventing toxic shock
syndrome, a federal judge says.
   ``This delay in issuing a tampon absorbency regulation is wholly
unreasonable and unacceptable,'' U.S. District Judge Barrington
Parker said Tuesday in issuing the deadline.
   The FDA, he said, ``has been lethargic in responding'' to its
legal obligation, especially since the government has known about
the danger for more than seven years.
   FDA spokesman Don McLearn declined to comment on the ruling.
   A revised FDA proposal issued in June would require tampon makers
to prominently display one of six new standardized terms for
absorbency ranging from low to highest.
   Under the proposal, tampon boxes would have to carry labels
advising women to select the lowest absorbency needed to minimize
risk of toxic shock syndrome.
   Toxic shock syndrome, or TSS, is a rare but sometimes fatal
condition associated with tampon use.
   ``Women are unknowingly subjecting themselves to toxic shock
syndrome simply because (government officials) drag their feet in
... standardizing tampon absorbency labels,'' Parker's opinion said.
   The opinion came in a lawsuit filed a year ago by Public Citizen
Health Research Group, a non-profit organization, to force the FDA
to issue tampon-labeling regulations.
   Regulations have required a warning about TSS since 1982 but
allow it to appear on a package insert.
   The FDA has tried since 1981 to have manufacturers label tampons
with a standardized absorbency rating. The agency tried
unsuccessfully to get tampon makers to voluntarily standardize
labeling, but began regulatory efforts in 1984.
   Parker said the FDA's reasons for delay are ``lame at best and
wholly irresponsible at worst.''

<HEAD>U.S. Condemns Israeli Deportations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is urging Israeli authorities
to complete an investigation into the death of an Arab-American
teen-ager and the disappearance of two other Americans.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday the
United States wants Israel to determine who killed a 14-year-old
American-born youth in the West Bank earlier this month.
   A report by a Scottish pathologist retained by the family of
Amjad Jibril Tawil said the youth was killed by a single gunshot
wound. Amjad was born in Denver, but lived in the West Bank for the
last four years.
   Boucher said the State Department had been in close touch with
the youth's family, as well as with relatives of two other Americans
of Palestinian origin who have been reported missing for more than
10 days in Israeli-held territory.
   ``We certainly understand the tragedy of the situation and their
agony,'' Boucher said. ``We've been talking to their families. We've
been following up with the Israeli authorities. We urge the Israeli
authorities to conduct a full investigation.''
   The United States also condemned Israel's expulsion of five
Palestinians on Sunday.
   The expulsions brought to 60 the number of Arabs deported for
their alleged role in organizing the 20-month uprising against
Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We deplore these latest deportations,'' Boucher said. ``These
measures corrode the atmosphere within which the peace process must
be moved forward and make it more difficult for Israelis and
Palestinians to engage in constructive dialogue.''

<TEXT>
   The World Tourism Organization voted to put off
consideration of a membership application by the PLO's self-declared
state of Palestine until the organization meets again in 1991.
   The United States, supported by Hungary and Australia, forced the
vote Tuesday to delay the membership consideration afer daylong
discussions. The vote was by secret ballot.
   The U.S. effort was led by John Bolton, assistant secretary of
state for international organizations, who said he was ``very
gratified'' by the outcome.
   The vote was 40-34 to postpone the issue, with six absentees, six
abstentions and five blank votes.
   One diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was
the first time he could recall a Soviet bloc country supporting a
U.S. resolution at an international meeting.
   The United States maintains that bids by the Palestine Liberation
Organization to join international bodies threatens Middle East
peace efforts.
   Omar Massalha, head of the PLO's observer mission to the
Paris-based U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
called the vote ``a bad decision.''
   Massalha said the PLO would continue its efforts to join
international organizations.
   The PLO's National Council, a sort of parliament-in-exile,
proclaimed the state of Palestine last November. Washington, backed
by most Western allies, says it does not fulfill international
criteria because it has no defined territory.
   The World Tourism Organization, with headquarters in Madrid, is
an intergovernmental group set up in 1975 to promote and develop
tourism.

<TEXT>
   A Havana-born Republican state senator rode heavy
support from Miami's Hispanic community Tuesday to become the first
Cuban-American elected to Congress, winning the seat held by the
late Claude Pepper for nearly three decades.
   With all precincts reporting in the ethnically divisive race,
state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, 37, received 49,638 votes, or 53
percent, to 43,759, or 47 percent, for Brooklyn-born attorney Gerald
Richman.
   The 48-year-old Democrat, who is Jewish, had been making his
first run for elective office.
   The race was made necessary by Pepper's death May 30 at 88.
Pepper, a Democrat, had held the seat since its inception 27 years
ago.
   The 93,000-plus turnout was nearly 51 percent, far higher than
normal for a special election and higher than election officials' 43
percent projection.
   The outcome was delayed more than an hour late Tuesday by a Dade
County elections computer problem that temporarily halted
vote-counting. Higher final counts for both candidates were revised
early Wednesday because of the counting problems.
   The unofficial returns indicated that predominantly Hispanic
precincts, with turnouts of more than 60 percent, boosted Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen with 80 to 90 percent margins, while Richman was
favored by margins of 80 to 90 percent in predominantly black or
non-Latin white precincts.
   In her victory speech, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said she wanted to unify
and heal the community and ``provide leadership ... which is based
on acaring conscience and conservative convictions.
   ``We do not have the luxury to waste time on divisive politics,''
she told cheering supporters at the Airport Hilton Hotel. ``We must
focus on what we have in common and not ponder on the negative.''
   Richman, addressing disappointed supporters at the Clarion Castle
Hotel in Miami Beach, said, ``We have done incredibly well and we
did it on a positive theme.''
   He said Ms. Ros-Lehtinen outspent him and had campaign help from
President Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle and Sen. Connie Mack,
R-Fla.
   The Democrat, noting that more Hispanics turned out than blacks
or non-Hispanic whites, said, ``We've got to get everyone in this
community to get out and exercise their right to vote. If that had
happened, we would have won tonight.''
   The Democrats, mindful that August is vacation month for many
Miami residents, had tried to build an absentee-vote margin for
Richman. But election officials said Richman had only 3,933 absentee
votes to 3,599 for Ms. Ros-Lehtinen.
   The victory gave the GOP an 11-8 majority in Florida's
congressional delegation, and Republican National Chairman Lee
Atwater called it a Republican milestone in the South.
   ``That seat has been a Democratic seat since it was created,'' he
said in a telephone interview from Washington. ``For us to win it is
a major victory.''
   Democratic Chairman Ron Brown, who campaigned for Richman,
expressed disappointment in a statement issued by his Washington
office, but said, ``The Democrats ran a surprisingly competitive
race after an admittedly divisive primary.''
   Ethnic-bloc campaigning dominated the short, tense race between
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Richman for the remaining 14 months of Pepper's
term. Richman had come under fire for declaring, ``This is an
American seat.''
   Richman had hoped to capitalize on the 30,000-plus edge that
Democrats, mostly blacks, Jews and retirees, hold in registration.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen looked to the Hispanic community, which makes up 40
percent-plus of the vote.
   Polls in the final week of the race had indicated it was too
close to call.
   `It's been a very controversial election,'' said Dade County
Elections Supervisor David Leahy. ``There has been a tremendous
amount of media exposure, and we think both camps are getting a lot
more people out to vote.''
   Pepper's seat was one of five openings in the U.S. House. The
others were caused by the resignations of Tony Coelho, D-Calif., and
Jim Wright, D-Texas, and the deaths of Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and
Larkin Smith, R-Miss., in plane crashes.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen had refused to appear with Richman during the
campaign, charging his ``American seat'' message was bigoted.
   However, the same charges were made against her campaign over a
Spanish-language mailing that urged Hispanics to show how American
they were even though they weren't born in Brooklyn and didn't speak
English like Richman.
   Richman's said his ``American seat'' remark was an appeal to
voters to decide on qualifications, not birthplace. He also said it
was a response to GOP National Chairman Lee Atwater's statement that
the party wanted to elect a Cuban-American.
   But many saw Richman's theme as anti-Hispanic code.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, a legislator for seven years, emphasized
experience and populist appeal in her campaign. Her campaign
chairman was the president's son Jeb.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, whose husband, Dexter Lehtinen, is U.S.
attorney in Miami, portrayed herself as tough on crime and drugs.
   But Richman argued that her legislative record against gun
control showed softness on crime, because it allowed criminals easy
access to guns.
   Richman also tried to make abortion an issue; he's pro-choice,
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen is for further restrictions on abortion. With polls
indicating most voters were pro-choice, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen claimed it
wasn't an issue.
   Richman, a former Florida Bar Association president, stunned the
Democratic establishment by breaking out of a seven-candidate pack
to win narrowly the party's Aug. 1 primary, then trouncing erstwhile
front-runner Rosario Kennedy in an Aug. 15 runoff. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen
won the GOP nomination in the Aug. 1 primary.
   The district covers black neighborhoods such as Liberty City,
most of Miami, Miami Beach and Miami Springs and sections of
blue-collar Hispanic Hialeah and upscale Coral Gables and Key
Biscayne.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Say Banned Pesticides Enter U.S. in Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group says new laws are needed
to prevent chemical companies from manufacturing highly toxic
pesticides banned in this country and sending them abroad.
   The practice ``has created a circle of poison'' where some food
tainted by the toxic chemicals is imported into the United States,
said Sandra Marquardt, who has followed the issue for the
environmental group Greenpeace.
   Greenpeace cited the practices of the Velsicol Chemical Corp.,
which from its plant in Memphis, Tenn., is the world's only producer
of the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor.
   Both pesticides are banned for agricultural use in the United
States and for virtually all other uses because they were found to
cause cancer. They are also banned or severely restricted in 48
countries.
   Nevertheless, Ms. Marquardt said Tuesday, Velsicol exported
nearly 5 million pounds of the pesticides to 25 countries between
1987 and the middle of this year. More than 330,000 pounds went to
Argentina and another 510,000 pounds to Australia, countries that
import meat and other products into the United States.
   In a statement from company headquarters in Rosemont, Ill.,
Velsicol called the Greenpeace report ``grossly inaccurate.''

<NOTE>Appeals Court OKs Random Drug Tests for Some Army Civilians</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court says the Army may
subject more than 6,500 civilian workers, including law enforcement
and aviation personnel, to random drug tests.
   The Army in 1986 implemented drug testing for more than 9,000 of
its 450,000 civilian employees.
   In a 3-0 decision Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals said 3,700
civilian police and guards should face mandatory drug tests because
of the threat to public safety posed by ``drug-impaired, gun-toting
civilian officers.''
   The 2,800 civilians who fly and service the Army's airplanes and
helicopters also should undergo random drug testing due to the
possibly ``calamitous consequences'' of a single drug-related lapse,
the appeals court said.
   A small group of civilian lab workers don't have to undergo
mandatory, random testing, said Appeals Court Judge David Sentelle.

   The chairman of the House Banking Committee
says he'll reopen his panel's investigation of the failure of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, expected to require the
government's largest thrift rescue.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, branded the collapse of the Los
Angeles thrift a ``mini-Watergate,'' and said his committee had
suspended its probe only because of the pressing need to pass
emergency legislation bailing out the S&amp;L industry.
   The probe is sure to examine political contributions from Charles
H. Keating Jr., chairman of Lincoln's parent company, American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix, to five senators who later met with
regulators about Lincoln.
   They are Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; John Glenn, D-Ohio;
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; and Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich. Riegle, who is chairman of the Senate Banking

<NOTE>Regulators Urge Quick Decision on Selling Nuclear Plant</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is urging a
California utility to decide soon whether to sell or dismantle its
Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, which voters said last June should
close.
   Thomas Murley, director of the NRC's office of nuclear reactor
regulation, told officials of the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District on Tuesday that uncertainty about the fate of the
913-megawatt plant was making it difficult to plan regulatory
changes there.
   The NRC must approve any transfer of the utility district's
nuclear license to another operator, but it also must approve the
various regulatory adjustments required if the plant is
decommissioned and dismantled.
   David A. Boggs, general manager of the utility district, said
efforts to sell the 15-year-old plant probably will be abandoned if
no agreement is reached by Friday with Quadrex Corp. of Campbell,
Calif.
   The Rancho Seco station has been closed since June 7, the day
after utility district residents voted against keeping it running.
It was the first time an operating nuclear power plant was closed by
voter initiative.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are showing further financial gains
this year, with the Agriculture Department reporting higher net
income and a growth in farm assets because of rising land values.
   Those are national figures and don't reflect the farmers who
aren't making it financially because of lingering effects of last
year's drought or burdensome debt they are unable to handle.
   Even so, a preliminary report said Tuesday, farm asset values
should rise 4 percent to 6 percent this year to a range of $780
billion to $790 billion from around $750 billion last year.
   ``Rising real estate values are driving this increase,'' the
report said. ``Debt levels will probably be unchanged from last
year.''
   Cash receipts from larger crops this year are boosting net farm
income more sharply than had been expected.
   Nationally, it said, net farm income could rise more than 10
percent this year to between $48 billion and $53 billion, $1 billion
more than forecast in July. Last year's net income was around $44
billion, and the record was $47 billion in 1987.
   As used by the agency, net farm income includes the value of
agricultural production whether sold or stored on the farm,
allowances for family dwellings and other adjustments, minus total
operating expenses.
   In another method of accounting, the report said this year's net
cash income ``could fall from last year's record $60 billion.'' Net
cash income does not include changes in inventory values and is
simply gross cash income during the year minus cash operating
expenses.
   Economists said cash receipts from the sale of crops and
livestock are expected to rise $2 billion to $10 billion this year,
more than offsetting a decline in direct government payments to
farmers.
   Total expenses are likely to go up 3 percent to 6 percent. About
one-third of the expected gain can be attributed to larger costs of
expanded crop acreage this year.
   But short-term interest rates also are going up, although
long-term interest rates are continuing to fall as old debt is paid
off. Overall, interest expenses are expected to rise by more than 10
percent this year.
   ``Wheat and corn receipts are expected to rise as much as 15
percent this year, following sizable gains last year'' the report
said.
   ``Vegetable receipts are also expected to rise. Soybeans,
however, probably will see falling receipts as higher domestic
production and record foreign output lead to a 25 percent decrease
in prices.''
   Total livestock and poultry receipts should see a modest rise,
but hogs could be the only livestock group facing a drop, the report
said. Although the decline in 1989 hog receipts is expected to be
small _ less than $500 million _ it will be on top of a $1 billion
reduction in 1988.

   The Agriculture Department's price support for
soybeans grown this year will be reduced 5 percent to $4.53 per
bushel from $4.77 in 1988, the maximum reduction allowed by law.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Tuesday that was a
preliminary decision and that the final 1989 soybean support rate
would be announced by Oct. 1.
   Department economists have forecast that soybean prices market
during the 1989-90 marketing year beginning Sept. 1 may average
$4.75 to $6 per bushel, compared with $7.35 in the current year.
   Under the price-support program, farmers can take out USDA loans
and then have the option of repaying them if market prices are
significantly higher when the loans are due. If prices are down,
producers have the option of turning their crop over to the
government, settling the debt.
   Soybean production is expected to be up sharply this year to an
estimated 1.9 billion bushels from 1.54 billion in 1988 when drought
reduced yields.
   The reduction in the support rate was required by a formula in
the 1985 farm law. Supports will be 75 percent of the average of
season prices received by farmers during the preceding five years,
not counting the high and low years.
   But the law says the support cannot be cut more than 5 percent in
any single year and in no event can be lowered below $4.50 per
bushel.
   Yeutter also said a ``marketing loan'' program won't be in effect
for soybeans this year. A marketing loan program would allow
producers to repay their price support loans at the prevailing world
market price or at the loan rate, whichever is lower.

   Indiana Bell reached a tentative contract
agreement Tuesday night with the union representing 4,200 striking
telephone workers, bringing parent company Ameritech closer to
ending a 17-day-old strike.
   The three-year pact between Indiana Bell and the Communications
Workers of America made Michigan Bell the only one of five
subsidiaries of Ameritech, a regional ``Baby Bell'' company, without
a contract agreement.
   The CWA has instructed all 37,000 members in Ameritech territory
to stay off the job until agreements are reached with all five
companies.
   Tentative settlements were reached over the weekend with Ohio
Bell and Wisconsin Bell, and on Monday with Illinois Bell.
   Talks with Michigan Bell resumed Tuesday, and continued early
Wednesday, said spokesmen for the utility and the union.
   The Indiana Bell agreement was announced by the utility and the
union. A ratification vote must be held within 45 days of strikers'
returning to work.
   Until strikers return, the company will continue operating with
management and supervisory personnel, said Indiana Bell spokesman
Estel Gibson.
   The Ameritech walkout began Aug. 13, seven days after strikes
began at three other regional phone companies formed in the 1984
breakup of AT&amp;T. The strikes have involved 200,000 workers in 20
states.
   Indiana Bell spokesman Dennis McCabe said the contract meets the
needs of employees while keeping the company competitive. He said
the tentative agreement includes salary hikes, improved pensions,
new family care features and profit sharing, McCabe said.
   Details of the pact will not be released until the company and
the union have had a chance to share the information with employees,
said Fredric A. Hunn, Indiana Bell vice president of human resources
and corporate development.
   Bell Atlantic workers in six states and Washington, D.C., ended
their strike Monday after agreements were reached with CWA locals in
Pennsylvania and Delaware. A tentative contract settlement has also
been reached at Pacific Telesis, serving California and Nevada.
   A strike continued at NYNEX Corp., serving New York and most of
New England, with talks scheduled to resume Wednesday with the CWA
and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

   Voters in four eastern Iowa counties
approved riverboat gambling that would allow floating casinos to
dock in their areas.
   In Scott County, the largest of the four counties voting on the
riverboat gambling initiative, the measure was approved by 23,999
votes, or nearly 60 percent, to 16,102, or 40 percent.
   ``A victory means this community has basically said `come on in,'
'' said Mary Ellen Chamberlain, coordinator of Citizens for
Riverboat Gambling in Scott County.
   ``It sends a message to developers and the Racing and Gaming
Commission that we will support riverboat gambling if the commission
wants it to come here,'' she said. ``I think it's an exciting
concept.''
   But the Rev. Sam VanderJagt, of the Newcomb Presbyterian Church
in Davenport, wasn't happy with the result.
   ``We're disappointed, surely,'' he said. ``We certainly aren't
going to be poor sports about it.
   ``This was an economic, moral and social issue. They are
intertwined, whether you are talking about theft, compulsive
gambling or prostitution. It sends the wrong signal.''
   In Muscatine County, voters gave the measure 3,939 votes, or 54
percent, to 3,315, or 46 percent.
   The proposal enjoyed wide support in Clinton County, with 7,903
``yes'' votes and 4,929 ``no'' votes for a margin of victory of 62
percent to 38 percent.
   The spread was much closer in Jackson County: 1,598 votes for to
1,496 votes against.
   Under a 1989 law, floating casinos may begin operation on Iowa
waterways aboard excursion boats April 1, 1991, but only in counties
where voters have given approval.
   Two weeks ago the riverboat gambling initiative was rejected in
the northeast counties of Clayton and Allamakee while it passed in
Dubuque County. Last Tuesday, voters in Lee and Des Moines counties
in southeast Iowa approved a gambling proposal.
   Along the Missouri River, Woodbury County supervisors have set a
Sept. 26 referendum while petitions were being circulated in Mills
County.
   The Legislature this year voted to authorize riverboat gambling,
limiting betting to $5 per play and setting a $200 nightly limit on
losses. Boats can offer blackjack, roulette, slot machines, dice
games and video gambling.
   Passage of the issue is only a first step in the process. The
Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission will decide how many licenses to
grant and where the boats will dock. Those decisions are not
expected until next year.

   Far in the cold darkness beyond Neptune,
a lonely Voyager speeds into the void, dozens of worlds in its wake
as it leaves a legacy that may aid the survival of its home planet,
a garden island in a sea of space.
   What wonders Voyager 2 witnessed as the one-ton spacecraft
cruised the solar system, traversing an arc-shaped 4{-billion-mile
path in 12 years as it trekked past four planets and at least 56
moons:
   In 1979, Jupiter and its moon Io, a hellish satellite of
sulfur-spewing volcanoes. Saturn and its graceful rings in 1981.
Five years later, Uranus, knocked on its side by some
incomprehensible collision. And today, the probe is 5 million miles
past deep blue Neptune, with its frozen volcanic moon Triton, once
flooded by seas of icy lava.
   Such marvels, such sights never before seen by human eyes, were
returned to Earth in 81,000 photographs captured by television
cameras aboard Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, which explored
Jupiter and Saturn before hurtling toward the stars.
   And what, one may ask, did these humble Voyagers, these piles of
1960s electronics, do for their human masters, for the American
taxpayers who paid the $865 million to propel them to the outer
planets?
   ``The immediate benefits of Voyager's pictures of Neptune and
Triton and their wealth of scientific information is to stimulate
our intellects and to nourish our souls,'' said Bruce Murray,
president of The Planetary Society and former director of the
National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``But surely over the coming generations those arcane facts will
become relevant to our destiny on Earth, just as earlier arcane
facts from Venus and Mars are now considered vital to our destiny.''
   Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan said: ``If you want to
understand Earth, go look at other worlds.''
   From Mariner and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied how
Venus' thick clouds trap solar heat, warming the planet to 900
degrees in a runaway ``greenhouse effect.'' It helped alert
scientists to how industrial air pollutants threaten to warm Earth,
flooding coastal areas and triggering droughts and starvation.
   Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina first warned of depletion of
Earth's ozone layer after using chemical formulas devised to help
NASA understand Venus' atmosphere, Sagan said.
   Sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory that
smoke from nuclear war could plunge Earth into a dark, cold nuclear
winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange
of warheads.
   ``The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the
great Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner
9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, Sagan said.
   ``The lesson we're learning is that the complexity of the
universe is something you'll never imagine without looking at it,''
U.S. Geological Survey geologist Laurence Soderblom said Tuesday at
a final news briefing on Voyager 2.
   At Neptune, Voyager discovered six moons in addition to Nereid
and Triton, which were first detected from Earth. It discovered
three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet.
It found at least six moonlets hidden in one ring.
   Voyager detected in Neptune's bluish atmosphere an Earth-size
swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mph winds,
photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus clouds
of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below.
   It also revealed two types of ice volcanoes on frosty, pinkish
Triton: 1,000-foot-deep craters measuring hundreds of miles across
that once produced ocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, and
volcanoes that may be active today, ejecting nitrogen ice 25 miles
high at speeds of 560 mph.
   Scientists presented new findings Tuesday showing Neptune's weak,
tilted magnetic field doesn't go through the center of planet but is
offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface. That and
other evidence suggest the liquid that generates the magnetic field
may exist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core
as inside the Earth.
   ``As exciting as the discoveries at Neptune have been, this
encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that
Voyager has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery,'' said
Voyager project scientist Edward Stone. ``For those of us fortunate
enough to be involved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.''
   Voyager 2 keeps looking back at Neptune until Oct. 2. Then, like
Voyager 1, it will collect information about particles and magnetic
fields in space and search for the edge of the solar system, sending
Earth information until about 2020.
   Then, carrying copper videodisks of pictures and recorded sounds
of Earth, the Voyagers will spend billions of years orbiting the
center of the Milky Way.
   Perhaps one day, an alien civilization will find one of the
Voyagers and play the record. They will hear a simple message
recorded by a 7-year-old boy from another time and another world:
   ``Greetings from the children of the planet Earth.''

<TEXT>
   Loretta Lynn has filed an $11.5 million
libel lawsuit against the tabloid Globe over its story that the
country music queen was hospitalized from a drug overdose that left
her ``near death.''
   Lynn filed the lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court.
   She charges the Globe's Feb. 28 story was fictitious and caused
her ``serious mental and emotional injuries, damage to her
reputation'' and loss of money.
   The article, under the headline ``Loretta Lynn Near Death After
Drug Overdose,'' described an overdose of Demerol, a powerful
prescription painkiller.
   ``The article conveyed to the reader the unmistakable
implications and impressions, fully intended by the defendant, that
the plaintiff had suffered a near fatal drug overdose at her own
hands and that the plaintiff currently suffers from dependency on
drugs such as Demerol,'' the suit said.
   Dean Heine, vice president of Globe International Inc., the Boca
Raton, Fla.-based publisher of the weekly Globe, declined to comment
Tuesday on the suit.
   Lynn, 54, was born in the coal mining community of Butcher
Hollow, Ky., later described in her biographical hit song and movie
``Coal Miner's Daughter.'' She was inducted into the Country Music
Hall of Fame in 1988.

<HEAD>Menem Willing to Meet Thatcher to Discuss Falklands Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentine President Carlos Menem was quoted in an
interview today as saying he wants to meet with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher in an attempt to resolve the Falkland
Islands dispute that led to a 74-day war in 1982.
   Menem suggested such a meeting could take place during next
month's session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. But Menem,
in office since July, said he would welcome direct talks with Mrs.
Thatcher ``in England, in Argentina or in any part of the world,''
The Times of London reported.
   Menem also said in the interview that he ruled out the
possibility of Argentina forcefully trying to recover the Falklands,
which it calls the Malvinas and has claimed since 1833. Their brief
but bloody South Atlantic war cost the lives of nearly 1,000 British
and Argentine soldiers.
   ``This is completely ruled out, at least during my government.
... We will not use weapons to recover what we believe and are
convinced is ours,'' Menem was quoted as saying.
   Menem added that he would invite Mrs. Thatcher to the Argentine
capital of Buenos Aires if diplomatic relations between the two
countries, which have been severed since the war, were restored, the
paper reported. ``I am planning to do so if Mrs. Thatcher is willing
to talk to me,'' it quoted him as saying.
   The exclusive interview was by Times correspondent Michael Llanos
in Buenos Aires but the paper did not say when it was conducted.
   There was no immediate reaction from Mrs. Thatcher's government.
But the British domestic news agency Press Association reported
without attribution: ``The view in Whitehall (British government
circles) is that if President Menem's words and proposals are
accurately represented, this is an attitude which Britain welcomes.
   ``However, while his words will be studied closely in (Mrs.
Thatcher's) Downing Street (office), the feeling is that any
British-Argentine dialogue should move forward one step at a time.''
   Representatives of the two governments agreed during three days
of talks in New York this month to hold a meeting of officials Oct.
17-18 in the Spanish capital of Madrid to discuss proposed
normalization of relations between the two nations.
   Similar talks in Bern, Switzerland, in July 1984 broke off over
the issue of sovereignty, with Britain refusing to discuss
sovereignty of the islands and Argentina insisting it stay on the
agenda.
   Mrs. Thatcher's government has consistently refused to discuss
sovereignty. But Menem has dropped the insistence of the previous
Argentine government headed by President Raul Alfonsin that
Argentina's sovereignty claim must be the first issue considered in
normalization talks.
   Argentina invaded the Falklands 325 miles off its southeast coast
in April 1982 but Britain sent a task force and recaptured them in a
war that eventually led the Argentine junta, which had ruled harshly
for nearly eight years, to relinquish power upon the election of
Alfonsin.
   Argentina claims the windswept islands as an inheritance from the
days of Spanish colonial rule and says the British, who have ruled
them as a colony since 1833, stole the islands.
   Argentina has never formally declared an end to hostilities with
Britain since the 1982 war.
   Asked in the interview in The Times if he thought island
sovereignty would be negotiated at any stage during his six-year
term, Menem was quoted as saying: ``It might, but it might not. We
have waited 156 years (to recover the islands). We can certainly
wait a bit longer.''
   Nearly 2,000 staunchly pro-British Falkland Islanders are
fiercely opposed to Argentina ever gaining sovereignty.
   Menem was quoted in the interview as saying that if full
diplomatic relations between Britain and Argentina were restored,
his government would allow airline flights and shipping services
between Argentina and Britain and Argentina and the Falklands.
   He was quoted as saying that this included the Indiana I, the
Falklands' own merchant vessel that caused a stir in recent months
by docking in neighboring ports in Uruguay and Chile.

   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank says will not talk about
running for a sixth congressional term until he has cleared the air
of the controversy caused by a male prostitute he once employed.
   When it was reported that Frank had paid Steve Gobie for sex and
then hired him to do household chores, the Massachusetts Democrat
said he did not believe the controversy should affect his political
plans.
   But Gobie has continued to allege that he procured sex partners
for Frank and that Frank knew Gobie was running a prostitution ring
out of Frank's Washington, D.C., home, charges the congressman
strongly denies.
   ``Before I have disposed of those charges, it's not fair for me
to be saying, `Hey I'm gonna run anyway,''' Frank said in an
interview Tuesday. ``I'm not going to talk about running again until
I can get the forum to clear those up.''
   The proper forum, Frank said, is the House ethics committee. On
Monday he asked Chairman Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., to investigate
Gobie's allegations ``to ensure that the public record is clear.''
   Frank has been re-elected since disclosing his homosexuality. But
after the disclosure that he paid for sex, some Republican leaders
called for his resignation.
   ``If everything Gobie said was true I should resign,'' Frank
said. ``The focus should not be on my political career. It should be
on the accuracy of these charges.''
   Gobie reportedly is looking for possible book and movie deals. He
said he has received hundreds of messages on his telephone answering
machine since his story appeared Friday in The Washington Times.
   ``Just leave a message on my answering machine _ if you can find
room on the tape,'' an early version of Gobie's message said.
   ``I'm an open person. I'll listen to all offers,'' he told the
Boston Herald.
   Gobie, who will be 33 years old on Monday, has said that he was
inspired to publicize his story by the television movie ``Mayflower
Madam,'' about Sydney Biddle Barrows, the New York City madam who
ran a high-class brothel.
   He told The Washington Post that he was motivated by money and
notoriety. Frank said he believes greed is leading Gobie to
embellish his story.
   ``There seems to be some change in the story, and it seems
someone told him that the more lurid the story, the more money there
will be for him,'' Frank said.
   Frank has said he employed Gobie, who has a history of
involvement with male prostitution and drugs, with hopes of
reforming him.
   Gobie's number was published in the City Paper, Washington's
weekly arts and entertainment guide, in an advertisement that
offered ``Total Pleasure _ Full body massage will make you feel it.
Young, handsome masseur avail. by appt.''
   Callers were greeted with background music of the '60s rock hit
``Light My Fire.''
   Gobie did not return a message left on his machine Tuesday, and
his outgoing message was toned down: ``I will return your call as
soon as possible or one of my associates will return your call as
soon as possible.''
   The congressman said Herb Moses, the man he currently lives with,
has been helping him through the ordeal of disclosure.
   ``He has made such an enormous difference in my life that this
has been a tolerable experience,'' Frank told The Boston Globe. ``I
only wish I met him five years earlier. He has provided emotional
and intellectual support that make a big difference _ the absence of
which contributed to the extent to which I was stupid personally
earlier.''

   A flightless bird the size of a Boston
marathoner gave authorities a good run and kicked an animal control
officer before police surrounded him and ended his two-hour escapade.
   The bird, a relative of the ostrich, fled in terror Tuesday after
he was accidentally freed from his owner's back yard.
   The owner's sons and police chased the emu, named PeeWee, through
streets in this seaside town southeast of Boston until police
finally surrounded him with a wire fence in a pasture.
   PeeWee was taken to Tufts New England Veterinary Medical Center
in North Grafton and given three stitches for a cut in the neck. The
bird was expected to go home today.
   Emus are flightless Australian birds with long legs and huge
three-toed feet. Owner Myrin Borysenko estimated PeeWee to be more
than 6 feet tall.
   Borysenko said he got the bird as a chick three years ago. He
said PeeWee was friendly but not very smart.
   ``Once he's outside the back yard, he has no point of reference.
If I'm in the yard he will recognize me. But if he's outside the
yard, he gets spooked,'' said Borysenko, who is a doctor of
immunology and anatomy.
   He said a neighborhood child probably opened the backyard gate,
letting PeeWee loose.
   Andrei Borysenko and his brother, Justin, went to the front yard
to collect the bird, but PeeWee became terrified and took off.
   ``As my son likes to say, as soon as he got out, his turbo kicked
in and he was flying down the street,'' Broysenko said.
   At the town common, animal control officer Lesley Cook got a
noose around PeeWee, but he leapt away and kicked her in the leg.
``His kick was about as hard as my horse could do, but I wasn't
hurt,'' she said.
   After police surrounded him, animal rescuers took the bird to the
medical center in a van. But Borysenko said his troubles aren't over.
   ``Now all I have to do is figure out how to get him home,'' he
said. ``I guess I'll have to get a van.''

<HEAD>Highway Officials Back Off ``Friendship State''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT ROTHSCHILD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Highway commissioners dropped plans to print
``The Friendship State'' on Texas license plates and said they were
at a loss for words following complaints that the slogan wasn't
tough enough.
   Commission Chairman Robert Dedman said Tuesday that he hoped a
consensus could be reached on a positive slogan that would temper
outsiders' views of Texans.
   ``We should do everything to say `Y'all come' to visitors to the
state and `Y'all come in bringing hi-tech and other jobs,''' he said.
   Responding to an outpouring of criticism about the earlier
decision to use ``The Friendship State,'' Dedman said perhaps
``Never give up'' should be the new slogan.
   As it is, Texas plates next spring will remain sloganless,
although more colorful with the red, white and blue state flag.
   On July 19, the three-member commission approved, with little
fanfare, putting ``The Friendship State'' on the state's 27 million
license plates, hoping the cheery message would attract tourists.
   Friendship is the official state motto and the word `Texas'
derives from the Spanish pronunciation of an Indian word meaning
``friends.''
   But once word of the decision reached the public, thousands of
Texans, prouder of their independence than their friendliness,
jammed telephone lines to the highway department and radio call-in
shows.
   Most said the slogan was too generic and bland.
   State Treasurer Ann Richards, a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for governor, called it ``wimpy.'' Republican
gubernatorial candidate Jack Rains said it ``looked a little quiche
and chablis.''
   The most popular alternative was the ``Lone Star State,''
although some suggested more topical slogans, such as ``Texas, the
Insolvent State,'' or ``The Bank Failure State.''
   Dedman said there is a feeling outside the state, particularly in
the North and East, that Texas has gotten what it deserved in the
state's financial and energy collapse. During the 1970s Arab oil
embargo, some Texans rode around with bumper stickers directed at
``Yankees,'' saying ``Let them freeze in the dark.''
   ``We should be collectively as a group of people as conscious as
we can be of being good marketers to the rest of the nation and try
to do whatever we can to overcome some of that perceived negative
outlook toward Texas,'' Dedman said.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Demands China Stop `Judicial Killing'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said today that it has
appealed to the Chinese government to ``stop using judicial
killing'' as a way to suppress internal opposition.
   The human rights organization said it sent a telex message to
Premier Li Peng saying it feared the brutal crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing last June reflected an
official policy of crushing peaceful opposition at any cost.
   Amnesty International did not release a text of its message to
Li. However, the organization said it appealed for the release of
all ``prisoners of conscience'' and for fair trials for all those
facing political charges.
   The London-based organization, which opposes capital punishment
in all countries, also called for an end to executions.
   In a report published today, Amnesty International estimated at
least 1,000 people were killed when security forces moved against
the demonstrators in Tiananmen Square and elsewhere in Beijing from
June 3-9, and that at least 300 more people were killed in Chengdu,
southern China.
   The government has said at least 200 died during the unrest.
   The statement also said, ``There was strong evidence that the
authorities had taken a deliberate decision after the army massacres
in early June to carry out secret executions, but also to publicize
certain death sentences in order to cow political opposition.
   ``Some (detainees) are reported to have been severely beaten by
police or soldiers and it is feared that detainees may still be put
under strong pressure _ including the use of ill-treatment and
torture _ to confess to crimes or to denounce others involved in the
protests.''
   Amnesty International said it expressed concern to Li about a
directive reportedly approved by the Communist Party's central
committee in June which specifically directed that the number of
persons executed or imprisoned were not to be made public.
   The report said Amnesty International had been unable to confirm
reports of mass executions.
   ``The atmosphere of terror following the military crackdown,
which has seen a continuing wave of repression, including mass
arbitrary arrests, summary trial and executions, has made it
impossible for Amnesty International to discover the true death
toll,'' the report said.
   It asked however that China ``stop using judicial killing as a
political tool'' to suppress the opposition.
   About 4,000 people have been officially reported arrested.
Amnesty said it believes the number is much higher and that many
detainees ``may be prisoners of conscience held solely for the
non-violent exercise of their fundamental rights.''
   In its message to Premier Li, Amnesty said, it inquired
specifically about Wang Dan, a 24-year-old Beijing University
student who was at the top of a list of wanted student leaders
published June 13.
   Amnesty cited reports that Wang was badly beaten following his
arrest, and included claims by a former policeman that the student
leader was executed.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen today,
and prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined sharply.
   The dollar closed at 143.08 yen, down 1.07 yen from Tuesday's
close of 144.15 yen. After opening at 142.86 yen, it ranged between
142.78 and 143.20 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's fall was in response to its
slide on the New York market Tuesday.
   ``The dollar's decline halted after it dipped into the 142-yen
range, when everybody felt it had reached the lower end of its
range,'' said a trader at a major commercial bank in Tokyo, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank said the dollar was likely to
remain within a narrow range until the release of U.S. economic
data, including unemployment figures for August, on Friday.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 80.24-point gainer Tuesday, fell 215.99 points, or 0.61
percent, closing at 34,471.66.
   Dealers said trading was relatively dull as many institutional
investors retreated to the sidelines after profit-taking outpaced
small-lot buying.
   Among the few gainers were banks, including Mitsui Bank and Taiyo
Kobe Bank, which announced plans on Tuesday to merge.
   Led by the two banks, other bank shares gained moderately, said a
dealer at Nikko Securities Co., also speaking on condition of
anonymity.

considered pro-choice before delegates reconsidered and maintained a
neutral position.
   As the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's first legislative
assembly neared its close today, it recognized that society was in a
``time of crisis'' about abortion, with ``mounting hysteria, fear,
polarization and violence.''
   The newly merged 5.3-million-member denomination settled on a
resolution Tuesday that advised ``information, counseling and
competent Christian guidance'' on abortion. This should be ``based
in the Lutheran traditions of Biblical grounding and social and
individual responsibility,'' the resolution said.
   The delegates avoided defining a position about abortion itself,
leaving that for a two-year study on sexuality and decision by the
next assembly in 1991.
   One delegate, Guy Erwin of New Haven, Conn., unsuccessfully
sought a speeded up process for developing a stand on this
``excruciating, sensitive'' issue, adding, ``We must begin to lead
or be led.''
   The assembly reconsidered and rejected an orginally approved
measure that many delegates interpreted as pro-choice.
   The Rev. Paul Hinlicky of Delhi, N.Y., exclaimed during the
debate, ``I will not obey this call for free access to abortion on
demand.''
   A nurse, Betty Jane Reisner of Whitehall, Pa., pleaded for
retaining the original, saying ``pro-choice allows pro-life. The
reverse is not true.'' To not permit it is ``taking away our
freedom.''
   In the end, delegates reinstated a revised version eliminating a
phrase calling for provision of ``free access to services.''
   Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, church president, said that if the
original was taken literally it would be contrary to previous church
statements.
   The three denominations that merged into the new body had taken
varying positions, one seeing human life as beginning at conception,
another less definite about it, but both upholding the sanctity of
unborn life.
   On another topic, the assembly urged ``loving care and
compassion'' toward AIDS sufferers, saying they often have been
``met with apathy, indifference or even antagonism and denial.''
   The church affirmed the ``rights and dignity of all persons
living with AIDS,'' and pledged to include them ``in the life and
worship of the church.''
   Steps also were taken for fuller inclusion of youngsters in
future assemblies, and to provide resources to meet needs of the
deaf and other disabled, and also those whose primary language is
not English.

<HEAD>EPA Review Condemns Proposed $500 Million Water Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HILLIARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of the proposed $500 million Two Forks
dam reacted with anger after a five-month federal review condemned
the water project as unnecessary and environmentally damaging.
   Lee DeHihns, an Environmental Protection Agency deputy regional
administrator from Atlanta who conducted the review, announced
Tuesday that he was recommending the EPA press on with efforts to
kill the project.
   Denver's Water Board said in a statement that the decision was
``a classical example of EPA bureaucratic arrogance that shows a
full disregard for the competency and expertise of a host of
federal, state and local agencies'' that supported the plan.
   ``You simply can't leave us high and dry,'' Mayor Federico Pena
told reporters Tuesday in reaction to DeHihns' announcement. ``We
have not been given a fair, objective appraisal of this project.''
   The 615-foot-high dam to be built 25 miles southwest of Denver
near the confluence of the South Platte River and its North Fork
would flood 30 miles of scenic river valley and canyon and the town
of Deckers, which has fewer than 100 residents.
   ``The Two Forks dam and reservoir project would result in the
loss of a major aquatic resource which provides irreplaceable stream
fishery habitat and recreational resources near the Denver
metropolitan area,'' DeHihns said.
   Peter A.A. Berle, National Audubon Society president, said
DeHihns deserves ``the heartfelt praise and gratitude of all
concerned Americans'' for his balanced review.
   ``His finding that EPA should proceed with a veto of this project
is a major victory in the continuing battle to protect the world
class wildlife habitat downstream on the Platte River in central
Nebraska, as well as Colorado's magnificent Cheesman Canyon,'' Berle
said.
   DeHihns said he was recommending continuation of a veto process
started March 24 by EPA administrator William Reilly. The next step
is two months of hearings. The final decision will be made at EPA
headquarters in Washington.
   DeHihns said vetoes are rarely overturned, and that about 7,000
pieces of mail his office received about Two Forks ran about 10-1
against the project.
   In response to criticism by the mayor and water board, DeHihns
said, ``I'm not happy they're upset. But I'm obliged to carry out my
responsibilities under the law.''
   Denver area water providers, contending new water resources are
needed for a growing metropolitan area, already have spent $40
million in research and planning for Two Forks.
   DeHihns said metropolitan Denver appears to have adequate water
supplies for now. He suggested Denver could put more water
conservation measures in place before.
   EPA officials said DeHihns could have let project proceed or
attach additional environmental requirements. His report said Two
Forks dam and reservoir ``was the most environmentally damaging of
the alternatives examined.''
   Besides flooding a prized trout stream, Two Forks would eliminate
about 300 acres of wetlands, and it would alter the river channel
with possible effects on threatened and endangered species
downstream, including in Nebraska, where officials have been
strongly opposed to the project.
   ``I caution that there are still powerful forces aligned against
us,'' Sen. Jim Exon, D-Neb., said in a statement.
   Sen. Bill Armstrong, R-Colo., called the decision a major setback.
   ``This decision was made by unelected officials applying
subjective standards to a project Coloradans have studied, decided
upon, and funded,'' he said.

   Rep. Mickey Leland's widow ended speculation that
she would run for her late husband's congressional seat, saying her
family came before any political ambitions.
   Alison Leland, a 30-year-old investment banker with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., released a one-page statement Tuesday saying she
would not be a candidate in the Nov. 7 special election to fill the
seat her husband held for 10{ years before his death in a plane
crash in Ethiopia.
   Mrs. Leland has a 3-year-old son, Jarrett, and is nine weeks
pregnant.
   ``My priority now has to be to my son, who already misses his
father very much and needs and deserves my attention even more
now,'' she said. ``We also have a new baby on the way, and I want
very much for this child to come into the world happy and healthy,
too.''
   Mrs. Leland said she would support Houston City Councilman Rodney
Ellis if he decides to run for the seat.
   ``It is clear to me that Mickey would have wanted to be succeeded
by City Councilman Rodney Ellis,'' she said. ``He loved Rodney, he
trusted Rodney, and considered him to be among his closest friends.''
   Previously, Ellis said he would not make a decision until Mrs.
Leland announced her intentions. Ellis did not immediately return
telephone calls to his office Tuesday.
   Leland and 15 others were killed Aug. 7 in a plane crash in
Ethiopia while on a hunger relief mission to a refugee camp.
   State Sen. Craig Washington and state Rep. Al Edwards have
announced they will run for the seat, and several others are
believed to be considering entering the race.

   A sand bank collapsed while two boys
were playing by digging foxholes, killing one boy and injuring the
second, authorities said.
   Anthony Zeiger, 9, was completely buried under the sand Monday
afternoon and probably died of asphyxiation, said Geary County
Sheriff Bill Deppish.
   His 10-year-old friend, Travis Enders, was buried up to his head.
He was treated at a hospital and released.
   Deppish said Travis reported the pair had been buried for a
little more than two hours before other youngsters heard his shouts
for help.
   The accident occurred along an 8-foot-deep drainage ditch near
the Republican River, behind the trailer court where the boys lived.
   ``Because of the recent rains down there, it was probably a
little more unstable than normal,'' Deppish said. ``The top just
caved in.''

<HEAD>Alabama Bans Hazardous Wastes of 22 States, D.C.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILLIP RAWLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alabama is banning hazardous waste
shipments from 22 states and the District of Columbia to keep the
state ``from becoming the waste dump of the nation,'' Gov. Guy Hunt
said.
   A representative of the hazardous waste industry said his group
plans to challenge the ban _ the second of its type in the country _
in court.
   On Tuesday, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management
identified states that would be affected by a law enacted in May. It
bars states from sending hazardous waste to Alabama if they don't
have some means of disposal within their own borders or if they
don't have a cooperative agreement with Alabama.
   ``The intent of this legislation was to force states to accept
responsibility for the hazardous waste they generate. In the past,
it has seemed Alabama was the path of least responsibility,'' said
Sue Robertson, chief of the department's land division.
   Alabama's ban is similar to one enacted earlier this year by
South Carolina.
   Tucker Eskew, an aide to South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell,
applauded the move and said the two states are aiming for ``a
regional approach which ensures reciprocity and fair burden
sharing'' in waste disposal.
   Richard Fortuna, executive director of the Hazardous Waste
Treatment Council in Washington, said the lobbying group has made
overturning the two states' laws a top priority. He said the state
laws violate federal interstate commerce statutes and will cause a
shortage of hazardous waste sites nationally.
   ``It is virtually certain we will challenge one. The only
question is whether we will challenge both,'' he said.
   Mrs. Robertson said Alabama's ban would affect only the hazardous
waste landfill at Emelle, the nation's largest. The law leaves it up
to the landfill operator, Chemical Waste Management, to stop
shipments from the banned states, she said.
   Chemical Waste spokesman Chris Grimshawe said the company is
studying the list of states and will decide later whether to take
legal action.
   According to figures compiled by state environmental officials,
Alabama ranks fourth in the amount of hazardous waste it collects
from other states, and second in net intake, which deducts waste
shipped out of the state. Indiana ranks first in both categories.
   Mrs. Robertson predicted the ban could reduce Emelle's waste by
50,000 to 100,000 tons for the rest of the year. Without the ban,
the department had predicted that the landfill would receive 700,000
tons of waste this year, up from 550,000 tons last year.
   Officials from Alabama and seven other Southeastern states will
meet Thursday in Atlanta to discuss ways to dispose of hazardous
wastes over the next 20 years. Mrs. Robertson said the ban ``could
be used as a negotiating tool'' to get the other states to handle
their share of waste.
   South Carolina is the only other Southeast state with a hazardous
waste landfill.
   Eighteen of the banned states and the District of Columbia have
no disposal facilities. They are Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida,
Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New
Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont,
Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.
   Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington were banned because they
did not respond to the state's request for information about
hazardous waste disposal within their borders.

<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms struck West Virginia with intense lightning today,
causing widespread damage in some areas. Other parts of the nation
also were hit by severe storms.
   In the northwestern part of West Virginia, lightning ignited
fires at several houses and mobile homes and downed trees, which
closed many major roads. Gusty storm winds also damaged trees near
Huntington.
   Thunderstorms reached across parts of Kentucky, Tennessee, the
lower Mississippi Valley, and from Missouri across Oklahoma and
northwest Texas to eastern New Mexico.
   Storms also caused heavy rain and flooding in the northwest
Piedmont of North Carolina.
   On Tuesday night, severe thunderstorms hit parts of Nebraska,
where hail up to 2 inches in diameter fell.
   An upper-level weather disturbance, moving onto the West Coast,
resulted in severe thunderstorms in western Oregon. Hail as large as
golfballs fell just north of Medford.
   Widespread rain fell in southern New England.
   Clear skies prevailed this morning from California across most of
the Plateau region to the central Rockies. Skies also were clear
over the upper Mississippi Valley and upper Great Lakes and from
eastern North Carolina to northern Florida.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the lower Mississippi Valley across the Tennessee Valley and
Gulf Coast states to the south Atlantic coastal states; lingering
showers along the mid-Atlantic Coast and northern New England;
scattered thunderstorms developing across the Dakotas, Montana and
Idaho, and scattered showers in Oregon.
   Predicted highs: 80s or 90s across much of the nation; upper 60s
and 70s from the California coast and the Pacific Northwest into the
northern Rockies, and from the upper Mississippi Valley to the Great
Lakes; near 100 in central Texas; and 100 to 110 degrees in the
desert Southwest.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 44 degrees at
Yellowstone, Wyo., to 91 at Blythe, Calif., and Phoenix.

   Justice Minister Monica de Greiff, who
drug traffickers want dead, summed up the dangers of her job after
taking office six weeks ago: ``If they want to kill you, they will _
with or without escort.''
   At the time it was merely a realistic statement by a woman who at
32 holds one of the most dangerous government posts in the world.
   Then she became a target in an anonymous phone call from a man
who said: ``You will be the next.''
   Since 1984, her ministry has been a post few covet. In that year,
drug traffickers murdered Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.
   Then, a former justice minister, Enrique Parejo Gonzalez, was
wounded in Budapest, Hungary, where the government had sent him as
ambassador because traffickers had threatened his life.
   Mrs. de Greiff was threatened Thursday, according to press
reports, and hours later she boarded a plane for Washington _ three
days before her original schedule _ amid rumors she had resigned.
   The reasons for her rush to confer with U.S. officials may help
Mrs. De Greiff meet one of her goals as a minister: to obtain money
to pay for protection for Colombia judges threatened by drug barons.
   The traffickers have vowed to kill 10 judges for every drug lord
extradited to the United States.
   As justice minister, Mrs. de Greiff is a member of a committee
deciding on extraditions.
   ``People should not be afraid of carrying out their duties,'' she
said in a Colombian radio interview three weeks ago.
   She told reporters in Washington earlier this week that she did
not intend to quit and that she was asking the Bush administration
for $19 million to build a security system to protect judges and
high officials in her ministry.
   The administration approved $65 million in emergency aid earlier
this month for Colombia's war on drugs.
   Mrs. de Greiff has made it clear that being a Cabinet minister is
the high point for her career as a lawyer. ``I got this job because
I have experience,'' she said recently.
   She graduated in 1980 from the exclusive Bogota University of The
Rosary, a Roman Catholic institution.
   After working for a few months with her father, also a lawyer,
she worked for other private firms developing administrative
experience.
   Mrs. de Greiff entered government service in 1986, when Virgilio
Barco became president. Her career began at the Urban Development
Office of Bogota. She later was appointed general secretary of the
Energy Ministry.
   She became justice minister on July 16 and took an immediate
dislike to the tight security surrounding her and her husband,
Miguel Paley, an Argentine public relations consultant, and their
3-year-old son.
   ``With all those armed guys protecting you, one must avoid going
out. But that is part of the price being in the post,'' she said.
   ``I love my family, but I have less and less time with them,''
she added. ``I hope this situation will improve soon.''
   It did not and when death squads killed leading presidential
hopeful Luis Carlos Galan Aug. 18, Mrs. de Greiff became involved in
an all-out government offensive against drug traffickers.
   As the government conducted raids across the nation, arresting
suspected drug dealers and confiscating millions of dollars in
property, said: ``I am not prepared for times of war like these.''
   The statement was considered untimely, and rumors that she
planned to resign became common in Bogota.
   She said Tuesday in Washington: ``The threats are out there, but
I am satisfied with my protection right now. I am determined that
the integrity of our justice system survives this crisis and I hope
to play my full part in assuring this.''

   Four people were arrested this morning as
racial tension and vandalism continued on the streets where a black
man was shot and killed by police.
   Officers in riot gear doubled their patrols and disbanded small
groups of youths to try to prevent a recurrence of the violence and
looting that broke out late Monday and early Tuesday.
   The mother of Samuel Williams, 26, who was shot Sunday, called
for calm as community leaders discussed longer-term solutions to
defuse the tension in this city of about 54,000.
   Three of the four arrested were jailed on charges of malicious
mischief in the overturning of a parked car, and the fourth on a
charge of failure to disperse.
   There were no arrests in another incident this morning, when
about a dozen helmeted officers chased about 10 people after the
group yelled obscenities at them. The group later threw bottles and
rocks at the officers, but there were no injuries.
   ``I don't think it's over,'' said 34-year-old Gary Childers, who
has lived in Vineland for about three years. ``It's just going to
escalate.''
   After reports of the shooting, nearly 200 people gathered on the
city's main street and threw rocks and bottles through store
windows. There was looting and about 20 cars were damaged, including
police cars that had windshields smashed. Four people were reported
injured and 26 people were arrested.
   On Tuesday night, about 200 people met at a church with religious
and community leaders and heard the victim's mother plead for an end
to the violence.
   ``That's not going to bring my son back,'' said Lucille Williams,
sobbing as other family members cried by her side. ``I don't want
nobody else killed. One is enough.
   ``Let's pull together and love each other,'' she said.
   Williams was shot Sunday after he apparently threatened officer
Paul Letizia with a steel rod, police Chief Joseph Cassisi said.
   Williams, who was wanted on drug and weapon charges, was spotted
by officers after police received an anonymous call about a man on a
bicycle carrying drugs, Cassisi said.
   After being told he was under arrest, Williams picked up the rod
and approached Letizia, swinging, Cassisi said. Letizia, who is
white, fired two shots, hitting Williams both times.
   The state Attorney General's office has taken over the
investigation of the shooting.
   Letizia has been taken off street duty and placed on special
assignment, city officials said.
   Samuel Clark, president of the local chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, met with Mayor
Harry Curley on Tuesday. Earlier, Clark called for Cassisi's
resignation, saying the police chief mishandled the matter by
calling the shooting a ``justifiable homicide'' before a complete
investigation.
   ``That was the catalyst,'' Clark said. ``That sparked the anger.''

   The nation's capital is closing in on a record
year for homicides, a dubious distinction that police blame on the
city's burgeoning drug trade.
   Two deaths early Tuesday morning and another Tuesday night
brought the number of people killed in the District of Columbia this
year to 302.
   At the same time last year, 216 people had been killed, and the
total of 372 homicides in 1988 set a city record.
   Police said at least one of Tuesday's slayings was drug-related.
   About 60 percent of the city's killings are related to drugs,
according to police, who add that drug-related violence has also
increased the murder rate in Washington's suburbs.
   Twelve people have been killed so far this year in Montgomery
County, Md., compared with nine at this time last year. In Prince
George's County, Md., 77 people have been killed this year, compared
with 53 at this time in 1988.
   Fairfax County, Va., has had 19 killings this year, compared with
12 last year, and Alexandria, Va., has eight compared with three
last year.

   So few students were killed during last
year's pro-democracy uprising in Burma that they weren't ``worth
mentioning,'' the country's health and education minister said.
   Dr. Pe Thein, addressing a Rangoon meeting Tuesday of scholars
just back from education overseas, said ``students must see the
truth behind last year's incidents.'' A transcript of his remarks,
reported in an official Radio Rangoon broadcast, was seen today in
Bangkok.
   Diplomats, dissidents and international human rights groups
estimate several thousand people were killed last year in a series
of army clampdowns on student-led unrest from March to September.
   According to witness accounts and independent reports, scores of
students were among those killed as troops fired indiscriminately
into crowds of peaceful demonstrators.
   ``I don't mean to say that there were no casualties, only that
there were few casualties, of which students constitute so small a
number as to be not worth mentioning,'' Pe Thein said.
   The military government admitted killing hundreds as it crushed
dissent in September, but it said most were ``looters'' or
``destructive ... unscrupulous elements.''
   Last June, all schools and universities throughout the country
were closed because of the unrest. Though primary and middle schools
recently re-opened, university and high schools remain closed.
   The minister said the country needed technocrats and
intellectuals to reconstruct the nation, but ``school teachers
(must) guide their students to becoming clever people and ...(to)
avoid taking part in destructive acts.''
   Pe Thein told the scholars that attempts were being made to try
to divide the army and the people in Burma.
   He accused foreign broadcasting stations of using ``human rights
issues to portray themselves as the only ones who love the country
and report that the defense forces do not love the nation.''
   ``The defense forces have been portrayed by some as a barbaric
force,'' he said.
   He warned teachers, as public servants, to stay clear of party
politics. ``Despite repeated warnings, we have had to part ways with
some (teachers) because of their contacts with political parties,''
he said.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon have reported authorities arrested
at least 2,000 people since putting the two leaders of the main
opposition group under house arrest on July 20.
   Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, who head the National League for
Democracy, were accused of trying to divide the people and the
military after criticizing the government's human rights record.
   The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon says it has received ``credible''
reports that many pro-democracy activists have been tortured,
sometimes fatally, after being arrested.

<HEAD>Probe of L.A. Mayor Reportedly Uncovers No Criminal Impropriety</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City investigators who have spent nearly five
months scrutinizing the personal finances of Mayor Tom Bradley have
uncovered no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it was reported today.
   Bradley could be fined for alleged improper financial
disclosures, but the man recently re-elected to an unprecedented
fifth term is unlikely to face any criminal charges, the Los Angeles
Times and Los Angeles Herald Examiner reported.
   A final report from City Attorney James K. Hahn is expected
sometime in September. ``The process still is going on. Anything can
happen in two weeks,'' the Times quoted an unnamed source as saying.
   Bradley has said he would not comment on the investigation until
the report is released.
   Hahn's inquiry focuses on the 71-year-old mayor's connection to
Far East National Bank, which paid Bradley $18,000 as a consultant.
   After some inquiries by Bradley, City Treasurer Leonard
Rittenberg subsequently had $2 million in city funds deposited with
the bank. Bradley said he did not pressure Rittenberg and Rittenberg
says he has not been pressured.
   Bradley later returned the $18,000 fee.
   The city attorney also is looking into whether Bradley violated
conflict-of-interest laws by accepting payments from Valley Federal
Savings &amp; Loan Association, as well as more than 100 errors in the
mayor's disclosures regarding extensive stock portfolio and property
holdings.
   Hahn plans to recommend that the city fine Bradley about $200,000
for his financial reporting violations, the newspapers reported.
   In addition to the local probe, federal investigators are probing
Bradley's many investments with Drexel Burnham Lambert and Michael
Milken, the former junk-bond king who recently resigned after being
indicted for fraud.

<TEXT>
   A day after he was sentenced to a year
in prison for perjury, Pat Swindall said he decided not to testify
at his trial to avoid revealing that he and his siblings were abused
by their father.
   The former congressman said Tuesday he decided to disclose the
family secret after discussions with his brothers, Kevin and Philip,
and his sister, Theresa. Kevin and Theresa joined him at his home in
suburban Atlanta for the news conference.
   ``My father's a very sick man,'' Swindall said.
   Swindall's father, Nathan, denied the allegations of abuse.
   Swindall, a Republican who represented Georgia's 4th District in
Congress for two terms until his defeat in 1988, was sentenced
Monday to a year in prison for his conviction on nine counts of
perjury. He also was fined $30,000 plus $450 in court costs.
   The former congressman said immediately after his trial that he
did not take the stand because a deposition taken in connection with
a dispute with his father ``contained information about something my
father did to a family member.''
   Swindall said Tuesday he felt certain that prosecutors would have
asked him on the witness stand about the alleged incidents, which he
described a day earlier as ``so disgusting I will not even publicly
disclose it.''
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said Tuesday night he did not believe
the prosecution would have raised the allegations during the June
trial.
   ``As far as I can tell this has nothing to do with his case; he's
having a severe case of Monday morning quarterbacking,'' Barr said.
   Swindall's sister said her father had sexually abused her as a
young teen-ager, but that her siblings had agreed not to discuss the
matter publicly until now.
   Nathan Swindall denied abusing his daughter.
   ``When anybody accuses me of incest he better be proving it. I
deny that completely,'' he said.
   Swindall, 38, remains free on his own recognizance pending an
appeal.
   Swindall was convicted June 20 lying to a federal grand jury in
1988 about his negotiations for an $850,000 loan from a federal
agent posing as a drug money launderer.

   Metal supports collapsed today at a soccer
stadium being prepared for 1990 World Cup matches, killing four
construction workers and seriously injuring another, police said.
   The accident occurred the day after top-ranking officials of the
International Soccer Federation visited Palermo's Favorita stadium
on a routine inspection of World Cup stadiums.
   Police said the workers were killed when a metal support
structure collapsed while being laid on top of cement pillars.
   The critically injured worker was rushed to a Palermo hospital.
   An investigation was ordered to determine the cause of the
collapse.
   Workers have been installing better seating in World Cup stadiums.
   The accident was expected to force suspension of work at the
Palermo stadium. Other World Cup stadiums are in Turin, Milan and
Rome.

<HEAD>Thirteen Players Suspended After Testing Positive for Steroids</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2nd graf to indicate these are the first suspensions
of any professional athlete for steriod use. A longer version moved on
sports wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE GOLDBERG ^AP Football Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Football League suspended 13 players
who tested positive for steroids, indicating that warnings of a
crackdown on the muscle-building drugs months ago may have worked.
   The action marked the first time U.S. professional athletes had
been suspended for steriod use. No other league conducts mandatory
tests for the drugs.
   The small number of suspensions under the new steroid policy
seemed to please even the NFL Players Association, which has
challenged the accuracy of tests and the suspensions.
   ``The fact that so few players have been suspended for alleged
steroid use indicates that the public perception of the steroid
problem in the NFL is greatly exaggerated,'' said Gene Upshaw,
executive director of the union and former All-Pro guard.
   Of the 13 players suspended for four weeks, only Pro Bowl guard
Ron Solt of the Philadelphia Eagles was of any prominence.
   Meanwhile, two other prominent players were suspended for using
illegal drugs. All-Pro cornerback Leroy Irvin of the Los Angeles
Rams and tight end Orson Mobley of Denver will miss the final
exhibition game and the first three regular-season games.
   Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced the steroid policy on March
21, saying he wanted to allow time for players who might be using
steroids to get them out of their system before the start of
training camp. A letter detailing the plan was sent 10 days later to
all players.
   In both 1987 and 1988, 6 percent of the players had positive
steroid tests, but no suspensions were imposed.
   The percentages were much lower this time. The NFL tested more
than 2,200 players for both illegal drugs and steroids. An
unspecified number of players tested positive but already have been
cut from their teams, the league said.
   The warnings seem to have worked, even by the testimony of one of
those caught, linebacker Mark Mraz of the Los Angeles Raiders.
   ``He was very disappointed and very emotional,'' coach Mike
Shanahan said. ``He said he was aware of the new policy since April
1. He informed me that he had not been on them since then.''
   But Coach Lindy Infante of Green Bay, who lost offensive linemen
Keith Uecker and Mike Ariey, said the warnings may not have been
enough.
   ``After all that was mentioned about it and all the letters that
had gone out and all the notoriety about the decision to test for it
and punish the people caught for it, I'm quite shocked that anybody
would run the risk of this happening,'' Infante said.
   The 13 players also included three Buffalo Bills _ brothers Tom
Doctor, a linebacker, and Sean Doctor, a fullback, and linebacker
Matt Jaworksi.
   Others were defensive back Maurice Douglass of the Chicago Bears,
running back Vince Amoia and wide receiver Bobby Riley of the New
York Jets, tight end Vernon Kirk of the Los Angeles Rams, and
running back Keith Henderson and nose tackle Rollin Putzier of San
Francisco.
   Coach Joe Walton of the Jets said he would release Amoia and
Riley.
   But General Manager Harry Gamble of the Eagles said he would
welcome back Solt. And Buffalo general manager Bill Polian said all
three of his suspended players will make the team.
   ``They are not druggies,'' Polian said. ``They're good kids who
made a mistake and are paying the penalty for it.''
   Upshaw said some players had called the union claiming they were
innocent. He suggested that tests may have mistaken other medication
as steroids or ``masking agents'' designed to hide the their
presence.

<HEAD>Actor Sues Surgeon Over Face Lift; Says Career Ruined</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You might not know actor Laurence Conroy by name,
but he bets you knew his dimples until a plastic surgeon smoothed
one away and, so he says, killed his livelihood.
   In a lawsuit made known Tuesday in State Supreme Court in
Manhattan, Conroy said his earnings as an actor in commercials
dropped more than two-thirds after a 1983 facelift erased his left
dimple.
   ``The secret of his success was his dimples, his Irish-American
dimply smile,'' said Robert Harley, Conroy's lawyer.
   In court papers Conroy, 59, said: ``I have a specific look which
is all-American, perky ... a genuine trustable person who sells.''
   The Daily News reported Conroy sued for $5 million; the New York
Post said $10 million.
   Conroy said that before consenting to surgery, he told Dr. James
Smith how important his dimples were to his appearances in ads for
Irish Spring soap, Bob's Big Boy restaurants, Hathaway shirts, the
Belmont Racetrack and Dellwood Milk, among others. He said Smith
assured him the operation would leave his dimples intact.
   However, Smith said Conroy was told before the operation that
there was no guarantee how the tightening of his jowls would affect
his dimples.
   According to the suit, Conroy won one job for about every six
auditions he made before he was operated on Oct. 20, 1983. After the
operation, he said he won only one job for every 50 auditions.
   In 1982 Conroy said he made as much as $56,000; two years later
his earnings plunged to $16,731.
   Conroy sued in 1984, but the case came to light Tuesday when
Justice Stanley Sklar ruled the actor could add breach of contract
to his suit.

<HEAD>Primate's Comments on Jews Stir New Controversy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 10 grafs to MOVE UP Polish newspaper criticism, and
edits to conform. Pickup 11th pvs, `Referring to...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic journalist, in a rare
criticism of the church, said Cardinal Jozef Glemp's remarks about
Jews may be ``deeply wounding'' to people who lost loved ones in the
Nazi holocaust.
   Criticism of Glemp's comments on Jewish-Catholic relations spread
worldwide on Tuesday, although some Catholic clerics said the Polish
primate's remarks may have been misconstrued.
   Glemp told pilgrims at Jasna Gora Monastery at Czestochowa on
Saturday that Polish anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews abandon
``anti-Polonism,'' or anti-Polish sentiments.
   He asked Jews to understand that it offended Poles' religious
sensibilities and feelings of sovereignty to insist on removal of a
Carmelite convent set up on the edge of the former Nazi death camp
at Auschwitz.
   ``Dear Jews, do not talk to us from the position of a nation
elevated over all others and do not put to us conditions that are
impossible to meet,'' Glemp said.
   But he intensified charges of anti-Semitism by using language
that invoked the image of Jews spreading communism and by saying
that Jews collaborated with Nazis during World War II, that Jews as
businessmen neglected or detested Poles and that Jews have easy
access to mass media.
   Polish Catholic journalist Krzysztof Sliwinski said: ``The
expressions used by the primate, even contrary to his intentions,
pose a danger of deeply wounding the feelings of many of those who
are descendants and brothers of the Holocaust victims.''
   The rare published criticism appeared Monday in the Polish
opposition's Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.
   Cardinal Albert DeCourtray, archbishop of Lyon in France, said
Tuesday it was unlikely that Glemp's words were meant the way they
were received.
   He said the ``primate and bishops of Poland cannot be accused of
an anti-Semitism, which they denounce.''
   Referring to Glemp's comment about easy Jewish access to mass
media, the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism
said in Paris that he had ``made use of arguments used against Jews
by the Nazis yesterday and by the extreme right in France today.''
   Yossi Sarid, a legislator from the left-wing Citizens Rights
Movement in Israel, said Tuesday in Jerusalem, ``Anti-Semitism has a
long history in Poland, and I think it is ridiculous to talk about
`anti-Polonism.'''
   Rome's chief rabbi, Elio Toaff, said in a newspaper interview
that the question of anti-Semitism is something the church ``has to
face. ... The analysis has to be deep enough to eradicate once and
for all the anti-Semitism that still exists in many countries, like
Poland.''
   ``It is particularly serious that it was Glemp, one noted for
diplomacy and political gifts, who confused cause and effects,''
said Tullia Zevi, head of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities,
quoted in the same article Monday in Rome's I Messaggero.
   The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France
issued a statement Monday calling Glemp's comments ``malicious and
out of place.''
   John Cardinal O'Connor, the archbishop of New York, said Tuesday
he was ``shocked'' by Glemp's ``harmful'' remarks.
   In a news conference, O'Connor also called on Polish church
officials to honor their commitment to move the Carmelite convent at
Auschwitz.
   The convent site has been criticized as offensive because an
estimated 2.5 million of the 4 million victims of Auschwitz-Birkenau
were executed simply for being Jewish.
   Only several thousand Jews live in Poland today compared with a
pre-war Jewish population of 3.5 million.
   Relations between the Catholic Church in Poland and Jewish groups
have been strained since Aug. 10 when Cardinal Franciszek Macharski
of Krakow, whose diocese includes the camp, announced the church was
suspending a 1987 agreement to move the convent. He said it could
not fulfill the agreement in an atmosphere of ``aggressive demands.''
   O'Connor said Glemp's comments could be construed to shift ``the
blame to the Jews for demanding that a signed accord be carried
out.''
   ``I don't think that is just, and I don't think that is
charitable. And it certainly doesn't represent my position,''
O'Connor said.
   The proposal to remove the convent, founded in 1984 just outside
the Auschwitz fence, has found little sympathy in Poland. Poles have
argued that thousands of the victims at Auschwitz were Polish
political prisoners, including many priests and nuns.
   Most Poles acknowledge that anti-Semitism still exists in Poland.
But some say its depth is exaggerated and note that many Poles
risked their lives to protect Jews during the war.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In the world of mathematics, Gregory and David Chudnovsky are
known for going the extra mile.
   Unsatisfied with their record 600-mile-long calculation of pi in
June, the brothers more than doubled that record, coming up with a
number containing more than a billion digits.
   ``They're starting more calculations, so it goes on from here,''
Denis Arvay, a spokesman for IBM, said Tuesday. ``I don't know when
they're going to stop.''
   Meanwhile, six California scientists extended man's search into
the infinite by determining the world's largest known prime number.
   The find left Joel F. Smith, one of the researchers, groping for
a way to describe the 65,087-digit number.
   ``It's God-awful large,'' Smith said. ``There's nothing in the
real universe that is comparable at all, that you measure in those
numbers.''
   Pi, the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle,
begins 3.14159, then continues on indefinitely with no known
duplication or pattern.
   Since pi was first approximated at 3 1@7 in ancient Greece, it
took centuries and the invention of the computer in recent decades
for scientists to calculate the ratio to more than 100,000 decimal
places.
   But in less than three months, the Chudnovskys extended their
record calculation from 480 million decimal places to more than a
billion.
   The Columbia University researchers did their work on two
supercomputers at International Business Machines Corp.'s Thomas J.
Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., the company said.
   The new mark of 1,011,196,691 digits appears to be a record,
Arvay said.
   Peter Renz, associate director of the Mathematical Association of
America, said he had not heard of anybody exceeding the researchers'
mark.
   In June, the Chudnovskys said their 480 million-digit pi would
stretch for 600 miles if printed.
   At the time, David Chudnovsky said calculating pi to such lengths
is useful for testing the performance of computer hardware and
software. He called the task ``the ultimate stress test.''
   In California, the six researchers at computer maker Amdahl Corp.
spent evenings and weekends during the last year using the company's
machines to find the largest prime number.
   The number equals 391,581 multiplied by 2 to the 216,193rd power,
minus one. To put that in perspective, that's 600 times the number
of atoms in the known universe, according to Sergio E. Zarantonello,
one of the researchers.
   ``It's like going to the moon, in a sense. There's not a lot
there, but it's important scientifically to do it because the
technology proves so useful,'' researcher Bodo Parady said.
   A prime number is any number that can be divided evenly only by 1
and itself.
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the previous
record was set in 1985 by David Slowinski of Cray Research Inc., the
supercomputer maker. The new number, discovered Aug. 6, has 37 more
digits and is a trillion, trillion, trillion times larger.
   Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Amdahl said Guinness had accepted the
number for entry into the publication.
   The discovery was announced at a meeting this week of the
American Mathematical Society by Sam Wagstaff Jr., a computer
scientist at Purdue University.
   Although the number itself has no known practical application,
the advanced multiplication programs honed by the researchers during
their work already are being used by scientists searching the
universe for pulsars, rotating neutron stars.
   The process also has applications in cryptology and bank
transaction coding, which use large prime numbers.
   The other Amdahl researchers were: John Brown, Landon Curt Noll
and Gene Ward Smith.

<HEAD>Afghan Rebel Leader Breaks With Guerrilla Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Afghan rebel leader who has been a
major recipient of U.S. military aid will boycott meetings of the
guerrillas' interim government until elections are held, his
spokesman said today.
   It was the latest blow to the Moslem insurgents'
government-in-exile, which has been troubled by bickering and
fighting.
   The leader, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar of the fundamentalist
Hezb-i-Islami rebel group, said he will no longer attend the
government's cabinet meetings until elections are held, his
spokesman, Abdul Qadeer Karyab, said in an interview.
   The move fulfilled a threat Hekmatyar made earlier this month
when he criticized the interim government for not meeting a
six-month deadline for elections and the drafting of an Islamic
constitution for Afghanistan.
   The charismatic rebel leader has repeatedly been accused of
treachery by rival guerrilla fighters.
   His group was accused of carrying out last month's massacre of 32
rebels of Jamiat-i-Islami, an equally powerful but more liberal
guerrilla group.
   Washington, the major supporter of the rebels, condemned the
killings in Afghanistan's northern Takhar province.
   Since then, the fighting between the two rebel groups has
escalated, and the latest reports claim hundreds may have died in
recent clashes.
   Jamiat leader Burhanuddin Rabbani called for Hekmatyar's
suspension from the government following the Takhar slayings.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, president of the rebels' interim
government, branded Hekmatyar a ``killer'' and claimed he has used
U.S. military backing to kill other guerrillas and Afghans.
Hekmatyar's group has been a major recipient of U.S. military aid
channeled through Pakistan.
   United States policy gives full support to the fragile
government-in-exile.
   Peter Tomsen, the U.S. special envoy to the guerrillas, was
meeting Afghan rebels based in the southwestern Pakistani city of
Quetta today and could not be immediately reached for comment.
   Tomsen is on his second tour of Pakistan, where the majority of
the anti-Communist rebels are headquartered. Aside from
accommodating the fractious guerrilla government, whose membership
is limited to seven major rebel parties, Pakistan shelters 3 million
Afghan war refugees.
   For more than a decade the insurgents have been fighting to
topple the Marxist government of President Najib. The guerrrillas
also receive military aid from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Arab
states.
   In 1979, Moscow sent in troops to back its communist allies
against a growing insurgency and to replace one leader with another.
But in February the last of more than 100,000 Red Army soldiers left
Afghanistan.
   Elections were promised by the rebel leadership within six months
of its government's establishment in February.
   Syed Gailani, the leader of the moderate National Islamic Front
of Afghanistan, holds the Supreme Court portfolio, which puts him in
charge of elections. But a spokesman for his group, Azim Nasser-Zia,
said the government does not have the money to hold the elections.
   ``Somehow nothing has been allocated for the Supreme Court to
have its own office, let alone conduct an election,'' the spokesman
said.
   ``It can't be done by just one man.''

   Police said one person was killed and 19 wounded in the fighting.
The latest casualties raised the toll from the nearly six months of
clashes to at least 803 killed and 2,287 wounded.
   The French envoy, Francois Scheer, drove from the Christian
sector across Beirut's dividing Green Line into Moslem west Beirut
during mortar and sniper exchanges. He met with Sheik Mohammed Mehdi
Shamseddine, the senior Shiite Moslem cleric in Lebanon.
   Scheer traveled with an escort of two carloads of bodyguards.
   During a 45-minute meeting at Shamseddine's second-floor
apartment in the Tallet Khayat district, five mortar rounds exploded
nearby.
   Scheer and Shamseddine moved from his living room to an interior
hallway for safety while they finished their discussions, according
to an Associated Press photographer at the meeting.
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio said two Frenchmen with an
engineering team, Alain Guigard and Pierre Paron, were wounded by
mortar shrapnel in Christian east Beirut today. Telephone lines were
out, and French Embassy officials could not be reached.
   Today's fighting flared early this morning after Syrian gunners
bombarded the 28-mile coastline of the besieged Christian enclave
north of Beirut.
   ``Their radar must have detected some ship movements off the
Christian enclave,'' said a spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   No ships were reported hit today.
   A Maltese-flagged tanker, the Sunshield, was hit and set on fire
by Syrian shells Tuesday as it tried to run the Syrian blockade.
Seven crewmen were killed and two were wounded. Police said two were
missing and believed dead.
   Before meeting Shamseddine, Scheer met with Patriarch Nasrallah
Sfeir, spiritual leader of the Maronite Catholic sect, for 90
minutes at his seat in the mountain-peak resort of Bkirki north of
Beirut.
   No details of the talks were reported. In addition, the envoy
declined comment on other talks he held Tuesday with Gen. Michel
Aoun, the Christian leader, and acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a
Sunni Moslem.
   Scheer, secretary-general of France's Foreign Ministry, arrived
in Beirut Tuesday after two days of talks with Syrian leaders in
Damascus.
   The French peace plan calls for lifting blockades by both sides,
a halt to arms deliveries to the warring factions, political reforms
to distribute power equally between Christians and Moslems, and the
withdrawal of Syrian and Israeli forces from Lebanon.
   Another peace envoy, Soviet Gennady Tasarov, left Iraq for Moscow
today after talks with the Palestine Liberation chairman, Yasser
Arafat, and Iraqi leaders. He has been trying to revive a stalled
Arab League peace effort.
   After the fighting broke out in March, Aoun declared a ``war of
liberation'' to drive the Syrians out of Lebanon. The troops came
under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, but Aoun says they
are really backing the Moslems in the nation's 14-year-old civil war.

<HEAD>Moldavians Considering Language Compromise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moldavia's Communist Party chief, in an effort to
placate outraged minority groups, proposed today that the republic
adopt a weaker version of a law making Moldavian the official
language, an activist said.
   The compromise, which reportedly resulted from a telephone
conversation between the party chief and President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, is aimed at stopping widespread strikes and other
protests in the republic.
   The initial proposed law would substitute Moldavian for Russian
in virtually all government and business transactions in the
republic. Russians and other minorities in the republic say the
proposal is discriminatory.
   The proposed compromise, outlined to the Supreme Soviet by
Moldavian party chief Semen Grossu, would make Moldavian the
language for government officials and documents, and Russian the
tongue for everyday contact among the republic's ethnic groups.
   The compromise was reported by Vasily Nestase, a leader of the
pro-Moldavian People's Front who spoke by telephone from the
republic's capital, Kishinev.
   Moldavia, which borders Romania, now has no law specifying which
language is to be used, but Russian has traditionally been the
tongue for government affairs.
   Grossu proposed the compromise after reporting he had spoken with
Gorbachev by telephone Tuesday night about the language controversy.
The Moldavian party chief did not say whether Gorbachev had
suggested the compromise, but Nestase said it was widely believed
this was the case.
   ``We think this is the most realistic compromise,'' Nataly
Pascal, another People's Front member, said in a telephone
interview. ``We support this compromise and we're not the only
ones.''
   The Moldavian Supreme Soviet began debating the proposal on
Tuesday, and Nestase said the session would continue Thursday.
   Gorbachev has quietly been involved in several attempts recently
to quell nationalist unrest breaking out in may of the Soviet
Union's republics. He told the Lithuanian party chief during the
weekend that the independence movement there had gone too far.
   Gorbachev also ``worked out'' with other members of the ruling
Politburo a tough party statement Saturday condemning nationalism,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news briefing
Tuesday. The statement by the policy-making Central Committee warned
that independence movements were leading the country into an
``abyss.''
   A strike organizer in the Moldavian city of Tiraspol, where
Russians and other minorities walked off their jobs last week to
protest the proposed language law, said strikers were willing to
consider the compromise even though they would still prefer that
Russian and Moldavian be given equal status.
   The weekly Moscow News today highlighted unemployment as a factor
in the republic's unrest. It said at least 150,000 of the republic's
4.2 million people are unemployed, and the number is growing.
   Pravda repeated earlier criticism of People's Front activists,
accusing them of ``spreading the seeds of separatism and
nationalism'' and claiming that Moldavian parliamentarians ordered
Pravda correspondent to leave the republic.
   The Supreme Soviet session addressing the law opened Tuesday, and
several thousand people, some carrying red-yellow-and-blue Moldavian
banners, gathered after the debate in downtown Kishinev to show
support for the People's Front.
   ``We have to seize the moment,'' said Ala Myndycanu, a member of
the People's Front governing council. ``We have to solve our
problems before Moscow does.''
   But non-Moldavian activists, members of the Russian-language
group Yedinstvo, warned that ``life won't be quiet'' if the original
law was passed over the objections of strikers.
   Disgruntled Russian-speaking residents of the republic are
striking at almost 200 factories and offices to protest the bill,
said Vsevolod Yampolsky of the Tiraspol strike committee. Most of
the strikes are in cities with large Russian populations.
   Tass reported today that railroad workers in several Moldavian
cities had joined the strike.
   The portion of the bill that would be cut out under the
compromise would have made Moldavian the language among Russians,
Ukrainians, Jews, Bulgarians, and other nationalities in the
republic. That goes farther than the language laws in a number of
other republics.
   Many non-Moldavians do not speak Moldavian, but they share some
knowledge of Russian as a result of Soviet schooling.
   The law also would restore the Latin alphabet, replacing the
Cyrillic imposed by dictator Josef Stalin after he annexed Moldavia
from Romania in 1940. Stalin imposed the Cyrillic, used in Russian,
to back up his claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinct
nationalities.
   Ethnic Moldavians make up 64 percent of the republic's 4.2
million people.

<HEAD>Solidarity Lawmaker: Break Communist Monopoly on Foreign Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Solidarity lawmaker criticized the
Communists' foreign policy record today and suggested a
non-Communist official should be named foreign minister in Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's new government.
   Bronislaw Geremek, head of the Solidarity parliamentary
delegation, also said in the pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza
newspaper today that the Communists should assume at least one
economic ministry so the party would have a sense of
``co-responsibility'' for economic policy.
   Communist leaders have been pressing to keep the ministry of
foreign affairs in the hands of current Foreign Minister Tadeusz
Olechowski, a party member.
   The post is one of several areas of conflict as Mazowiecki, a
longtime Solidarity activist, forms the East bloc's first government
led by non-Communists.
   Geremek has said that the new government would be announced
before Sept. 10. Mazowiecki assumed office on Aug. 24.
   ``Experiences in Polish foreign policy ... indicate that the
(Communist Party) does not serve'' national interests, Geremek said
in the interview published today.
   He cited a recent agreement with Warsaw Pact ally East Germany
over disputed waters in the Baltic Sea near the port of Szczecin,
which many Poles believe was settled to Poland's disadvantage.
   Geremek noted that the information department of the foreign
ministry legally ``functions as a service unit for the Central
Committee'' of the party. This ``does not correspond to the
requirements of the new period,'' he said.
   Although Geremek did not say specifically that the ministry
should be taken away from the party, his remarks about breaking the
party's monopoly on foreign policy appeared to indicate that the
ministry should go either to Solidarity or one of two minor allied
parties, the United Peasants and the Democrats.
   Communist Party Secretary Leszek Miller, who is acting as the
party's envoy in the coalition talks with Mazowiecki, argued
strongly Tuesday for the party to retain control of the ministry.
   ``We think that the best candidate is Tadeusz Olechowski,'' he
said in an interview with the party paper Trybuna Ludu. ``If
professionalism is a criterion, then undoubtedly Olechowski is an
expert of the highest class.''
   He also cited Poland's alliances in the East bloc that he said
have protected national security.
   ``No matter what you accuse the party of, its foreign policy is
not subject to criticism,'' Miller said. ``It has guaranteed us a
safe, stable place in Europe, Poland's favorable position in the
world and alliances which allow us a feeling of national security.
   ``Society needs this feeling and it has to be maintained.''
   Geremek said he favored only limited participation by the
Communists in the Mazowiecki government. ``Broad participation .. .
would not be understandable to public opinion,'' he said.
   Solidarity already has promised the Communists control of the
important defense and interior ministries, which control the army
and police.
   Geremek reiterated in today's article that the party ought to
take one of the five economic ministries: finance, agriculture,
foreign trade, labor or industry. That way it ``could not be in
opposition to the government's economic policy and spread social
demagogy,'' he said.
   He suggested that non-Communist adminstrators serve just below
the defense and interior ministers.
   Another controversial area is control of the mass media. Geremek
said the committee that oversees state radio and television should
be put under control of parliament, where Solidarity and its allies
hold a majority.
   Personnel decisions in radio and television will be one of the
quickest signs of change under the new government, Geremek said.

   A bus drove off a mountain road and
plunged 500 feet into a ravine, killing 35 people, police said.
   The accident took place near the mountain village of Shahpur in
the Swat valley, 100 miles northwest of Islamabad, the capital,
police said.
   The bus was on a regular mountain run between the villages of
Alipuri to Alandar when it swerved on a sharp curve and plunged over
the edge.
   Police said 35 passengers died instantly, five others survived
with injuries. Their conditions were not immediately disclosed.
   Pakistan's northern areas have been soaked with monsoon rains
recently, but police said they did not know if weather was a factor
in the bus crash.

   The Bush administration appears to be largely
``on automatic pilot'' because of the president's failure to fill
many top executive branch positions, Democratic congressional
researchers say.
   Bush had not nominated anyone by Aug. 9 to fill 160 of the top
394 positions requiring Senate confirmation, the Democratic Study
Group said Tuesday.
   ``It is believed that this number of vacancies so late in a
president's first year in office is without precedent,'' the report
said.
   Among them, although Bush has said he wants to be remembered as
an ``education president,'' are five of the seven assistant
secretaries of education, it said.
   Four assistant administrator slots are vacant at the
Environmental Protection Agency and the president has not nominated
anyone as chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, the
report said. Openings were also listed for three undersecretaries
and 13 assistant secretaries in other departments.
   ``It appears as though a significant portion of the government is
on automatic pilot,'' said the DSG, an organization of House
Democrats that provides research papers to members of Congress.
   The DSG said it did not have comparable figures for past
administrations, although its analysis in May showed that four
previous presidents had made appointments during their first six
weeks in office at a pace two to four times as fast as Bush.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Stephen Hart, reached by
telephone in Kennebunkport, Maine, where the president is
vacationing, said the administration's count is not the same as the
DSG's.
   ``Their numbers conflict because they wanted to go with the
broadest brush to try and add to the sensational nature of their
conclusions,'' Hart said.
   The White House counts 308 presidential appointments within the
Cabinet departments. Hart said appointees to 129 of these posts have
been confirmed, and 38 are awaiting confirmation. He said 25 Reagan
appointees had been retained and 84 candidates were now being
cleared for appointment. He said most of the remaining 37 vacancies
had candidates under consideration.
   ``The notion that somehow George Bush has been crippled by the
fact that he hasn't got all of his assistant secretaries in place
just doesn't make any sense,'' Hart said.
   The DSG report dealt with a larger figure because it included
posts outside of the Cabinet departments.
   The report said that as of Aug. 10, only 156 of the 394 positions
were filled by an appointee confirmed by the Senate. Nominations for
60 positions were awaiting confirmation, and remain so since
Congress has been in recess.
   Two nominations, of John Tower to be secretary of defense and
William Lucas to be assistant attorney general for civil rights,
were rejected. Tower was turned down by the full Senate and Lucas by
the Judiciary Committee.
   For 16 positions, appointees of former President Reagan have been
asked to remain on the job.
   ``It is not clear how the failure to fill so many key positions
in a timely manner will affect the Bush administration or the
country generally,'' the report said. ``It does, however, appear to
set the administration on a course that is virtually 180 degrees at
variance with the prevailing view of scholars and former White House
officials on how the presidency should be managed.''
   Defenders of the administration have argued that Bush did not
need to move quickly because he succeeded a president of his own
party and thus did not need to make major policy changes.
   The DSG, however, said the slower pace ``could be as important a
liability to the Bush administration as it would be to any other.''
   Even if the remaining nominations are made and confirmed quickly
this fall, those people would have missed most of the planning for
next year's budget and legislative initiatives, the report said.
   All of the Cabinet positions have been filled. However, posts for
which no nomination has been made and no Reagan holdover is in place
include two assistant secretaries of agriculture, an undersecretary
of commerce, a deputy undersecretary and six assistant secretaries
of defense, an assistant secretary of energy, two assistant
secretaries of health and human services, two assistant secretaries
of housing and urban development, an assistant secretary of the
interior, a deputy attorney general and associate attorney general,
an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of state, an
undersecretary and an assistant secretary of the treasury and three
assistant secretaries of veterans' affairs.
   The only department at which all the top posts have been filled
is Transportation, the report said.

<TEXT>
   Dorothy Schiff, the heiress who molded the
historic New York Post into one of the nation's most liberal dailies
during her 37 years at its helm, died of cancer today. She was 86.
   Peter Faris, a vice president at the Post, said Schiff died at
her Manhattan home. She had been sick since May.
   The Post, Schiff once said, advocated ``honest unionism, social
reform and humane government programs.'' Her paper was a
middle-class tabloid, packed with columns and features, restrained
only by Schiff's legendary tight fist.
   The Post is the oldest continuously published newspaper in
America, first published by Alexander Hamilton in 1801, and was one
of the few metropolitan newspapers owned by a woman.
   She was credited with saving the Post when she broke with other
publishers during a long newspaper strike in 1963 and resumed
publishing under the old contract. The paper gained circulation
during that period, and within a few years became the city's only
afternoon paper.
   ``Often voted least likely to succeed in New York's competitive
journalistic climate, she outmaneuvered such moneyed rivals as
Hearst's Journal-American, Scripps-Howard's World Telegram and Sun,
and John Hay Whitney's Herald Tribune, and in the end outlasted
them,'' noted Newsweek.
   On Nov. 19, 1976, after years of turning down potential buyers,
she sold the Post to media magnate Rupert Murdoch, reportedly for
$31 million. Murdoch transformed the Post into a racier and more
politically conservative tabloid before selling it to real estate
developer Peter S. Kalikow last year.
   Dorothy Schiff, known to many as Dolly, was born on March 11,
1903, in New York City to Mortimer and Adele Neustadt Schiff. Her
grandfather was financier Jacob Schiff, a founder of the Kuhn, Loeb
banking house and a prominent philanthropist.
   The heiress studied at New York's exclusive Brearly School and
attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.
   ``I was a rich kid of the right kind _ not the robber baron type
_ and had been to the right schools,'' she said in a diary entry
quoted in a 1976 biography by Jeffrey Potter called ``Men, Money and
Magic.'' ``I remember being furious whenever it (her wealth) was
mentioned. People even said, not entirely joking, `Come on, give me
a million. You won't even miss it.'''
   But Schiff's thrift at the newspaper was legendary. The Post
always seemed to do more with less _ the smallest staff, the most
decrepit equipment.
   ``I don't know if it's fear of being self-indulgent or a
puritanical guilt, but spending just isn't easy for me,'' she once
said.
   In the early 1930s, Schiff became involved in social welfare
efforts _ a settlement house for immigrants, several hospitals, a
club that provided lunches to women looking for jobs in New York.
   She became a confidante of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and
his wife, Eleanor. At one point, she declined Roosevelt's invitation
to run a program in his administration for farm women.
   Her involvement in politics escalated, however. George Backer,
her husband, was appointed to the City Council and then ran
unsuccessfully for Congress. Schiff was a Democratic candidate for
the state Constitutional Convention in 1938, losing to city Parks
Commissioner Robert Moses.
   In 1939, Schiff bought the Post at Backer's request. At first,
Backer served as editor and president; she served as director and
vice president and her ownership was not public knowledge.
   Financial losses led Schiff to believe that the paper needed
comic strips, columns, features and a tabloid format. When Backer
disagreed, Schiff promoted Theodore Olin Thackrey from feature
editor to executive editor.
   In 1942, Schiff became president and publisher. She divorced
Backer in 1943 and married Thackrey.
   She and Thackrey differed in print in 1948. Thackrey supported
Progressive Party candidate Henry Wallace; Schiff backed Republican
Thomas E. Dewey. By 1950, Thackrey was out, both as Post editor and
as Schiff's husband. In the 1950s, under James Wechsler, the Post
became known for investigative reporting.
   The Post eventually found an audience among the city's liberal
middle class.
   After years of profits, the paper's fortunes dimmed in the 1970s
as much of its audience moved to the suburbs. Ultimately, Schiff
sold it to Murdoch. ``It was a terrible headache,'' she said.
   Schiff's four marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was
Richard B.W. Hall, followed by Backer, Thackrey and Rudolf Sonneborn.
   She is survived by her two daughters, Adele Hall Sweet and
Sarah-Ann Kramarsky, her son Mortimer H. Hall, 15 grandchildren and
nine great-grandchildren.
   Faris said a private burial was planned, with a memorial service
later.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops File Brief in Abortion Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops are urging
the Supreme Court to use a pair of cases from Ohio and Minnesota to
overturn its 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   In a friend-of-the-court brief filed earlier this week, the U.S.
Catholic Conference said past high-court rulings on abortion have
usurped legislative authority. The brief added: ``For this court,
the time has come to decide whether to continue to write rules or to
allow legislatures to legislate.''
   The Catholic Conference, an arm of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, filed a similar brief earlier this year in a case
the court used to give states greater power to regulate abortions.
   The justices already have agreed to study the Ohio and Minnesota
cases during the term that begins in October. Both cases involve
laws that require doctors to notify the parents of young, unmarried
girls who seek abortions.
   The court also will study an Illinois case involving stringent
regulation of abortion clinics.
   The Ohio and Minnesota parental notice laws have been portrayed
erroneously as creating conflicts between the rights of parents and
children, the Catholic Conference brief asserted.
   ``If a family is to retain any vitality when confronted by this
reality (of a young girl's pregnancy), its members must ... be
entitled to reflect upon and discuss whether (the girl) should
consider termination of her pregnancy through abortion,'' the brief
said.
   It added: ``To rule that a state may not shield the family for a
brief time for this kind of consultation is to deny family integrity
and ultimately to undermine familial relationships.''

<HEAD>Minorities, Women Accept Out-of-Court Settlement on Discrimination
Suit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of minority and female police
officers that sued the city for discrimination has accepted a
settlement after recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings against
affirmative action programs.
   ``There are mixed feelings,'' said Stephen Drew, the attorney
representing the 10 minority and 11 female officers. ``Considering
the latest rulings, we did not feel that the laws of this country,
as interpreted by the Supreme Court, are favorable to minority and
female litigants.''
   According to the settlement, the city will pay the officers
$325,000, including court costs and attorney fees. It was not
disclosed how much each person would receive, Drew said.
   The Supreme Court recently issued decisions to restrict
affirmative action programs and make it more difficult for
plaintiffs to prove discrimination in the workplace.
   In March 1988, the minority officers _ eight blacks, a Hispanic
and an American Indian _ sued the city, seeking $4.6 million in
damages. Two months later, 11 female officers filed a similar suit
seeking more than $1.6 million.
   Both suits alleged the officers were denied promotional
opportunities because of their race or gender. The two cases were
joined for the purpose of settlement talks. The trial was to begin
Sept. 12.
   At the time the suits were filed, only one of the department's 45
command officers _ sergeant and above _ was classified as a minority.
   At the heart of both suits was a written exam and performance
evaluation for the position of sergeant that the officers said were
discriminatory and never had been validated to ensure they conformed
to civil rights regulations.
   The city has agreed to hire an independent consultant to develop
a professionally validated test for sergeant promotions.
   Drew said the timing of the Supreme Court rulings made it
impractical for him to take the case to court.
   He said he believes the settlement ``indicates a willingness on
the city's part to put the bad behind us and move forward. Hopefully
that will lead to better minority and female representation on the
police force.''

   Police battled protesters nationwide
today during demonstrations against alleged corruption in Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government. More than 100,000 people were
reported arrested and 10 killed.
   A daylong general strike shut down commerce and transportation in
the six states governed by the opposition, but it was less effective
in the 19 states controlled by Gandhi's Congress Party.
   At least 80 people, including five policemen, were injured and
more than 103,450 people were arrested during the strike, police
said.
   United News of India reported two people were killed during a
clash involving police and pro- and anti-government demonstrators in
the southern state of Kerala, which is governed by a coalition led
by the Marxist Communist Party.
   The news agency said seven people were killed in the northeastern
state of Tripura, also governed by the Marxist Communist Party. Four
of the victims died when strike supporters hurled a bomb at a
passenger bus, the new agency said. Two were killed in a clash
between police and strike supporters, and one person was stabbed to
death, it said.
   In Calcutta, the country's largest city and the capital of
Marxist-ruled West Bengal state, one opposition supporter was killed
and 46 injured as police fired into the air and threw tear gas to
try to separate the warring groups, police said.
   V.P. Singh, leader of the fractious opposition, said more than
100,000 opposition supporters were arrested in eastern Bihar state
for enforcing the strike. At least 36 people were hurt, eight of
them seriously, when baton-carrying police charged stone-throwing
mobs, witnesses said.
   About 2,700 people, including 16 lawmakers, were arrested for
sitting on railroad tracks in southern Tamil Nadu state, police
said. Arrests during such protests are routine and detainees are
released after a few hours without charges.
   More than 700 opposition activists were arrested in southern
Andhra Pradesh states, while 50 were taken into custody in northern
Punjab state, police said.
   In New Delhi's central shopping arcade, police used batons to
break up clashes between pro- and anti-government supporters.
Opposition leader Atal Behar Vajpayee and several members of his
Indian People's Party were arrested, police said.
   The altercation broke out as activists trying to enforce the
strike were confronted by Congress Party workers, police said.
   ``As a member of the opposition I wanted the strike to be
successful, but I also wanted it to be peaceful and non-violent,''
said Devi Lal, chief minister of northern Haryana state and a key
opposition leader.
   The opposition has been trying for nearly two years to focus
attention on government corruption. But previous efforts have
rapidly lost momentum, largely because squabbling opposition leaders
could not agree on a strategy.
   Last month, in a rare display of unity, 106 opposition members
resigned from Parliament, saying a government audit into a
controversial arms deal proved kickbacks were paid to senior
officials and members of Gandhi's party.
   Opposition leaders contend a Swedish company, AB Bofors, paid $50
million dollars in kickbacks and bribes to secure a $1.4 billion
contract to supply artillery guns to the Indian army. The government
and the company deny wrongdoing.
   An opinion poll conducted in July by the respected news magazine
India Today indicated Gandhi and the Congress Party were almost
certain to win the election. According to the poll of 10,399
registered voters, the party would return to power capturing 58
percent of the 542 seats in the decision-making lower house of
Parliament.
   Today's strike was called in part to gauge the opposition's clout
before parliamentry elections, which must be held by Jan. 4, 1990.
   Most shops and businesses in the capital closed despite increased
police.
   Government offices operated normally as thousands of employees
stayed overnight in their workplaces. The government had said those
who failed to work would lose a day's salary.
   State-run Delhi Transport Corporation operated its entire fleet
of 3,800 passenger buses, PTI quoted an official as saying. But
witnesses said most buses had few passengers.
   Press Trust of India said mobs hurled stones at buses in
opposition-controlled areas of New Delhi and at least 14 vehicles
were damaged. Several activists of the right-wing Indian People's
Party were arrested following the violence, it said without
elaborating.
   The other participants of the strike are the Communist Party of
India, the Marxist Communist Party and the National Front, a group
of seven parties.
   On Tuesday, police arrested at least 5,000 political workers
across the country to prevent violence.

<HEAD>U.S. Calls Special OAS Meeting on Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: Top 7 grafs new with official statement, British call for
Noriega's ouster, deadline of Panama's president; picks up at pvs 5th graf,
The OAS ^By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At U.S. request, the Organization of American
States will hold a special meeting Thursday to present evidence of
the alleged involvement of Panama's military leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega in drug trafficking, it was announced today.
   Thursday is the expiration date of the term of Panama's
provisional president, Manuel Solias Palma, appointed by the
National Assembly last year. U.S. officials and Panama's opposition
parties are concerned that Noriega will name a puppet government and
ignore calls for free elections.
   The meeting will come just one week after the OAS dealt a blow to
U.S. hopes of ousting the general by adopting a resolution that
stopped short of calling on Noriega to step down.
   In requesting the meeting, the United States said it wants to
present ``a summary of the evidence and elaboration of the United
States position on the critical situation in Panama,'' the OAS press
office said.
   The decision to call for a meeting of the hemispheric council
came in response to a challenge by Panama's delegate at last week's
session for the United States to present evidence of Noriega's
alleged wrongdoings, said U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   They said it was not yet clear whether the evidence will be
presented by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who
represented the United States at last week's session, or by another
official.
   In London, meanwhile, the British Foreign Office today urged
Noriega to step down and ``open the way to a peaceful, democratic
resolution of Panama's problems.''
   The OAS resolution last week expressed deep concern over the
failure of a mediating team dispatched by the organization to
promote a democratic transfer of power in Panama.
   The document called on Panamanians to settle their differences by
Sept. 1, the date on which the constitution calls for the
installation of a new president.
   Most OAS delegates viewed U.S. demands that Noriega step down as
a dangerous precedent for intervention in the internal affairs of
member states.
   The United States has been pressing Noriega to step down since
February 1988, when he was indicted by two federal grand juries in
Florida on charges involving drug trafficking.
   Noriega has claimed the efforts are an attempt to renege on the
U.S. pledge to hand over the Panama Canal to his country's control
next year.
   Noriega has served as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces
for six years. U.S. officials believe he will install a puppet
successor next month, after voiding results of May 7 elections that
observers agree gave a wide majority to the U.S.-backed opposition.

   Exterminators began their attack on a
closed-down City Hall in their war to rid the building's basement of
rats, mice, fleas and squirrels.
   Building inspector Tom Harmon declared the building in this small
resort community unfit for humans Monday because of the rodent and
parasite population. The extermination began Tuesday.
   The building would remain closed until Thursday morning, Harmon
said.
   Lake Ozark Mayor Rick Moss said he saw the action as a positive
step toward cleaning up the city.
   ``And if that means shutting down City Hall, we're going to do
it,'' Moss said.
   In April, the city council passed a dangerous buildings ordinance
and hired Harmon as part-time inspector.

<TEXT>
   The nation where World War II began will
mark the 50th anniversary of the German invasion beginning Thursday
with a series of events nearly overshadowed by the startling
political events under way.
   Joining Communist President Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski at official
events will be Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and newly named Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist to head a
Polish government in 45 years.
   Planned commemorations include an internationally broadcast
concert by Leonard Bernstein, speeches at Westerplatte, where the
war's first shots were fired, and an international prayer for peace
led by a televised message from Polish-born Pope John Paul II.
   The war has an enduring poignancy in Poland, which fought against
Hitler from the conflict's start on Sept. 1, 1939, to the victory in
Europe on May 9, 1945.
   More than 6 million Poles died, a fifth of the population and a
higher percentage than any other nation. The toll included 3 million
Jews, deported to death camps such as Auschwitz and Treblinka that
the Nazis built in the once-obscure Polish villages by those names.
   At war's end, 40 percent of Poland's national property was lost
and Warsaw was empty and leveled. In the capital, stucco facades of
homes still show the scars of battle.
   To some, the war's toll continued at the hands of the Communist
government that took power backed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
   ``We will pay homage to all victims of the war, we will pay
homage to its heroes and we will express the will to live in
peace,'' said Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a spokesman for Jaruzelski.
   The commemoration begins one week after Communist and Solidarity
lawmakers joined to elect Mazowiecki prime minister. The Solidarity
editor heads the first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc.
   The events begin tomorrow night with a parade to Victory Square
and a changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
   Jaruzelski, who went to Siberia with his family after the Soviets
invaded and later joined the Polish army organized under the
Soviets, will lead the ceremony.
   On Friday, Jaruzelski, Walesa and others will gather in the
Baltic port of Gdansk at the 75-foot granite memorial honoring the
defenders of Westerplatte, where the German battleship
Schleswig-Holstein fired on a garrison of 182 Polish soldiers to
start the war.
   War veterans from Poland and the Allies will participate,
including about 70 survivors of the attack.
   Bernstein will conduct a concert Friday evening at Warsaw's Grand
Theater with actress Liv Ullmann and others in a televised benefit
for the U.N. agency UNICEF.
   Bernstein will open with lines from W.H. Auden's poem,
``September 1, 1939,'' and Samuel Pisar, one of the youngest
survivors of Auschwitz, will narrate reminiscences accompanied by
photographs and film of the destruction of Warsaw. Ms. Ullmann will
narrate Arnold Schoenberg's cantata ``A Survivor From Warsaw.''
   An International Day of Prayer for Peace will bring together
representatives of world religions for conferences and contemplation
on Thursday and Friday.
   ``The lessons we draw from World War II must be drawn for the
whole world, for international reconciliation and understanding,''
said Wladyslaw Klaczynski, an organizer.
   The pope is to address his countrymen Friday evening via a
television screen set up in the Royal Castle Square at Warsaw's Old
City, rebuilt after the being razed by the Nazis.
   Jewish groups representing the few thousand Jews who remain from
a population that numbered 3.5 million before the war, will mark the
anniversary with a photo exhibition, ``Jews in Struggle for
Poland,'' and a service at Warsaw's lone synagogue conducted by the
country's only rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, who arrived this
spring from Israel.
   There will also be wreaths laid at the monument to the Warsaw
Ghetto uprising and at Umschlagplatz, where Jews were loaded into
railroad boxcars for transport to the death camps.
   Solidarity, the independent union born in Gdansk, has scheduled
masses and concerts, including one by bands of miners and shipyard
workers.
   West Germany will send a five-member delegation of parliament
members.
   It had been expected that West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker might visit for the anniversary. But the tentative plans
were dropped because of lingering diplomatic tensions between Poland
and West Germany, concerning among other things a stalled West
German aid package to Poland.
   The United States will be represented by Secretary of Veterans
Affairs Edward Derwinski, the highest ranking Polish-American in the
Bush administration. The Soviet Union, France, Great Britain are
among the other nations invited to participate.

<TEXT>
   Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who became the first
Cuban-American elected to Congress, pledged today to unite Miami's
multi-ethnic community after an emotional race for the late Rep.
Claude Pepper's seat.
   ``I think it's been a terribly divisive and ethnically divisive
campaign,'' Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said on NBC's ``Today'' show after
defeating Democrat Gerald Richman in Tuesday's special election.
   ``But now it's time for healing, now we have to reach out to all
those sections,'' she said. ``I know there are a lot of people out
there who feel alienated. It was a very bitter battle but now we're
going to start healing those wounds.''
   Richman, who didn't rule out seeking the seat again in the
scheduled election in 14 months, also promised early today to try to
ease the ethnic tensions.
   ``I and she will unify the community,'' Richman said.
   During the monthlong campaign, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen refused to debate
Richman following claims that his ``American seat'' theme stirred
prejudices against Hispanics.
   Richman had said his remark ``This is an American seat'' was an
appeal to voters to decide on qualifications, not birthplace. He
also said it was a response to GOP National Chairman Lee Atwater's
statement that the party wanted to elect a Cuban-American.
   ``It was a rough campaign. Wounds from it need to heal,'' said
Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, 37, a state senator since 1982 and wife of U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, called on Richman and his supporters to
meet to discuss the drug and crime problems facing Miami.
   ``We do not have the luxury to waste time on divisive politics,''
she told more than 1,500 cheering supporters, most from Miami's
conservative Cuban community. ``We must focus on what we have in
common and not ponder on the negative.''
   Pepper, the liberal advocate for the elderly and the only person
to hold the seat, died May 30 at age 88.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's campaign included appearances by President
Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle. Her campaign chairman was the
president's son, Jeb.
   Atwater called the victory a GOP milestone in the South.
   ``That seat has been a Democratic seat since it was created,'' he
said from Washington. ``For us to win it is a major victory.''
   With all 159 precincts reporting, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen had 49,638
votes, or 53 percent, to Richman's 43,759 votes, or 47 percent.
Turnout was 50.6 percent, unusually high for a special election.
   The district covers black neighborhoods such as Liberty City,
most of Miami, Miami Beach and Miami Springs and sections of
blue-collar Hispanic Hialeah and upscale Coral Gables and Key
Biscayne.
   According to unofficial returns, predominantly Latin precincts
had turnouts of more than 60 percent and gave Ms. Ros-Lehtinen 80 to
90 percent.
   Richman, a 48-year-old attorney and political novice, conceded
that a surprisingly strong Hispanic turnout tipped the election.
   ``They voted overwhelmingly,'' said Richman, who counted on heavy
backing from black and fellow Jewish voters and the 30,000-plus edge
in registered Democrats. ``We've got to get everyone in this
community to get out and exercise their right to vote. If that had
happened, we would have won tonight.''
   Some of the Cuban exiles at Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's victory gathering
said that although her election is symbolic of their assimilation
into the United States, they still feel excluded from mainstream
America.
   ``We have brought Ileana to office on our own with no support
from others,'' said Richardo Samiter Sr., 55. ``We have been trying
to cross the bridge that separates us, but we are treated like
second-class citizens. These things we do not forget quickly.''
   ``This is a very important step for Cubans. One of us is in
Washington now,'' said Mario Esteves, 49. ``She is our blood. She
knows our mind. She knows our feelings.''
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen faces re-election in 14 months, when Pepper's
term would have expired.

   About 500 people were allowed home after
they were evacuated early today because of burning pesticides at a
nearby feed store.
   Several residents reported breathing problems and a few
firefighters were overcome by smoke, but there were no serious
injuries, said Lt. Andrew Casciato of the Ravenna Fire Department.
   A three-block area, which included apartments and group homes for
the elderly, was evacuated, he said.
   The fire was under control but still smoldering at 9 a.m., more
than three hours after it was reported at the Ravenna Landmark
Grainery.
   The fire broke out in a section that contained fertilizers and
pesticides, Casciato said. The area was destroyed, Casciato said.
   ``The product itself was being consumed by the fire. We didn't
want to put water on it because that would allow it to contaminate
the ground,'' he said.
   The fertilizers and pesticides were allowed to burn out, although
some water was initially used to cool down the area and keep the
fire from spreading to adjoining buildings, he said.
   Timothy Hickin, a duty officer at the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency in Columbus, said investigators would be sent into
the building when the fire was completely extinguished.

   A Russian prima ballerina went to the
dentist for a filling, but came away with a fan.
   Yulia Makhalina, a member of the Soviet Union's Kirov Ballet,
went to Dr. Stuart Green's office about a week ago to have a chipped
tooth fixed.
   When she tried to pay her bill, Green balked, saying he was
honored to help a rising ballerina with her dental problems. She
persisted.
   Green said he thought of his 6-year-old daughter, Janae, a ballet
student. So he asked for a pair of tickets.
   Ms. Makhalina, 21, sent tickets and she and the rest of her
troupe welcomed Green and his family backstage Saturday night at the
Orange County Performing Arts Center.
   Green also took his wife and 9-year-old son to the ballet, but
paid for those tickets with his own money. He said he ``didn't feel
right about asking for four tickets.''

   President Bush's only daughter,
Dorothy, has separated from her husband, William LeBlond, sources

   The White House officially issued no comment on the separation,
which was confirmed by sources close to the family. First lady
Barbara Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez, said only, ``It's her
private affair.'' She said there would be no other comment.
   Mrs. LeBlond, 30, has been with her parents during much of the
president's vacation that began Aug. 16. She frequently jogs with
her father in the morning. She lives in nearby Cape Elizabeth and
works for the Maine tourism bureau as coordinator of meetings and

   Singer Engelbert Humperdinck will perform a
scheduled two-week engagement at the Las Vegas Hilton despite a
strike by musicians, a hotel spokesman says.
   Humperdinck cited an obligation to his fans and his band as the
primary reasons for going ahead with his scheduled appearance,
spokesman Bruce Banke said Tuesday.
   Humperdinck, who would be the first singer to cross picket lines
established by Musicians Local 369 at five major Las Vegas resorts,
could not be reached for comment. Banke would not give the name of
an agent for the singer.
   Musicians also have been on strike at Caesars Palace, Bally's,
the Flamingo Hilton and the Tropicana. The dispute centers on the
resorts' use of taped music instead of bands and the hotels' plans
to drop guaranteed workweeks in favor of paying musicians only for
the shows they work.

   Former first lady Nancy Reagan says fear
wasn't keeping her away from a school in a gang-infested
neighborhood; she simply was never invited.
   Board of Education member Rita Walters had criticized Mrs.
Reagan, saying her refusal to appear next month at John Muir Junior
High School to present an anti-drug grant was an insult to the
community.
   But Deputy Police Chief Glenn Levant called a news conference
Tuesday to clear up the controversy, saying it turns out to be
``much ado about nothing.''
   ``The only thing I can surmise is the school board was not
presented all of the facts. There's nothing political about drug
abuse,'' Levant said.
   Mrs. Reagan will present a $50,000 Nancy Reagan Foundation grant
for school anti-drug programs on Sept. 14 during Drug Abuse
Resistance Education Day ceremonies. Part of the money was earmarked
for the John Muir school and the school board staff told Walters the
former first lady wouldn't go to the Los Angeles neighborhood
because of security concerns.
   ``There simply was no invitation, request or expression of
interest conveyed to the foundation or me that I make the
presentation at John Muir Junior High School,'' Mrs. Reagan said.

   Mr. Blackwell, the celebrity fashion
critic known for his annual, acerbic worst-dressed list, is glad to
see the Beverly Hills Police Department recognized for its nattiness.
   The department won a special achievement award in a national
best-dressed police contest sponsored by the National Association of
Uniform Manufacturers.
   ``I think it's because in Beverly Hills there is a greater sense
of grooming,'' Blackwell said. ``There are never any smudges. They
are opulently conspicuous in Beverly Hills.
   ``Actually, it is almost like a private army in a separate
country there in Beverly Hills.''
   Top honors in cities with fewer than 200 officers went to the
Hickory, N.C., Police Department.
   Although Beverly Hills officers wear the standard Navy blue
uniform, Lt. Robert Curtis said an attention to detail gives them an
appearance edge. For example, rather than black plastic buttons,
Beverly Hills cops use brass ones.

   A group of Nashville studio musicians are
disputing a claim by Ringo Starr that he and they were drunk when
the former Beatle recorded an album in Memphis two years ago.
   Starr has sued to keep the album under wraps, saying he was
suffering from alcoholism when it was recorded, and that the
recordings are not up to his standards. A Georgia judge has blocked
the record's release pending a trial expected in early October.
   ``He seemed to be real sharp to me,'' said Bobby Wood, a piano
and keyboard player who recorded with Starr in the February and
April 1987 sessions. ``I noticed that he wasn't on key. But you
know, Ringo's never been on key. He's just not that great a singer.''
   Starr said in his suit against CRS Records of College Park, Ga.,
and Memphis producer Chips Moman that marijuana was sometimes smoked
during the album's recording and he and the other musicians were
sometimes intoxicated.
   But Wood and drummer Gene Chrisman, whose Memphis Rhythm Section
played on the album, said no alcohol or drugs were used during the
sessions.

   A judge rejected a crack user's plea for leniency
and sentenced her to life imprisonment for letting a man rape her
13-year-old daughter to pay drug debts.
   Judge James J. Rashid said Tuesday that Susan Barbier ``sunk to
an intolerable level of humanity,'' and showed no potential for
rehabilitation.
   Barbier, 29, who could be paroled in 10 years, was convicted of
first-degree criminal sexual conduct for giving her daughter to a
man who raped her twice.
   Anthony Sawyer, 28, was convicted on the same charge and was
sentenced by another judge Thursday to 40 to 60 years in prison.
   Barbier maintained her innocence.
   In a letter to Rashid dated Aug. 18, she said: ``I feel I have
been punished enough,'' in losing her children to her ex-husband,
the letter said. ``The last two years of my life has been nothing
but tragedy.''
   Rashid said he imposed more than the 10 to 25 years called for in
sentencing guidelines because they ``don't accurately reflect the
nature of this crime.''
   ``Your daughter trusted you and you abused that trust beyond all
bounds of decency,'' Rashid told Barbier.
   ``This case demonstrates tragically the far-reaching impact of
drugs on innocent people,'' the Wayne County circuit judge said. ``I
have not heard of such a situation where drugs were responsible for
a mother subjecting her own daughter to sexual abuse.''
   Sawyer testified that Barbier offered her daughter to settle a
drug debt, then smoked crack with him after the attack.
   Assistant Prosecutor Kelly Ramsey said Barbier's daughter called
the May 1988 rape the worst hour of her life.
   ``The child is grateful her pain is finally over,'' Ramsey said
after Tuesday's sentencing. ``She can begin rebuilding herself.''
   The victim, now 14, had written a two-page statement before
sentencing, but was too shaken to read it in court, said her father,
Michael Dare.
   ``She wanted to ask the judge to keep her mother in prison long
enough that she can't endanger (her) younger children,'' ages 6 and
8, said Dare, 33. ``She spent so much time taking care of those kids
that she felt like a mother instead of a sister.''
   Dare said he plans to lobby for legislation easing regulations on
taking children away from parents who are drug users.
   Wayne County Juvenile Court granted Dare temporary custody of the
victim and her sister, 13. The two other children, who are
half-sisters, were staying with a relative.
   Although Barbier will be eligible for parole in 10 years, Rashid
must first be notified and then has authority to deny her release,
Ramsey said.

<HEAD>Plan Reportedly in Works to Transport East Germans to West</HEAD>

   The International Red Cross is working on
a plan to transport at least 1,500 East German refugees from Hungary
to the West in the next few days, an Austrian government source said
today.
   The report came amid heightened speculation that officials were
formulating a plan to deal with thousands of East Germans who have
traveled to Hungary in an effort to flee their Communist homeland
for the West.
   A report in the Munich-based Abendzeitung newspaper today said
15,000 East Germans would be allowed to go West from Hungary by the
weekend.
   The crush of East Germans, who have also tried to flee this
summer through East Berlin and Czechoslovakia, has created friction
between East Germany and several other nations and forced West
Germany to close diplomatic facilities that have been overwhelmed by
refugees in several East bloc cities.
   The Austrian government source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the International Red Cross plan involves
transporting the refugees from Hungary to Austria and then to West
Germany. The source said it was not yet clear if they would leave
Hungary by train or airplane.
   There was speculation that a West German envoy sent to Austria
today was trying to work out the reported plan.
   West Germany dispatched the senior diplomat to meet Austrian
Foreign Minister Alois Mock, Foreign Ministry spokesman Walter
Greinert said.
   The spokesman said Bonn envoy Michael Jansen thanked Mock for
Austria's role in offering help to thousands of East Germans who had
already fled across the Hungarian-Austrian border. He declined to
comment on whether Jansen was working on a Red Cross plan.
   Rezsoe Sztuchlik, head of the Foreign Relations department of
Hungary's Red Cross, said he had no knowledge of such a plan.
   In Budapest, however, a senior Foreign Ministry official, Gyula
Szelei, told The Associated Press that Hungary is working with both
East and West Germany to deal with the refugees.
   The rush of refugees began in Hungary after reform-minded
Communist Hungarian authorities began removing border fences in May.
   Some refugees say they are fleeing the hard-line Communist system
in East Germany, but others say they are simply looking for a better
economic life.
   Last week, Hungary allowed 108 East Germans holed up in the West
German Embassy in Budapest to go to West Germany in a plan also
organized by the Geneva-based International Red Cross.
   But Bonn and Budapest said it was a one-time occurrence.
   There are 2,200 East Germans in camps set up by the Hungarian Red
Cross for those who want to flee West, with 150 new arrivals each
day, said Sztuchlik.
   At least 200 other East Germans are holed up in Bonn's closed
missions in East Berlin and Prague hoping to go to West Germany,
where they receive automatic citizenship and assistance in starting
a new life.

   A British official today said
authorities will investigate whether security forces in Northern
Ireland leaked documents that helped Protestant gunman identify a
Roman Catholic man they later killed.
   However, John Cope, the minister of state for Northern Ireland,
also suggested that the Protestant group members made the claim to a
reporter of the British Broadcasting Corp. in order to discredit the
police.
   BBC reporter Chris Moore said in a television report Tuesday that
he had met with four masked men from the outlawed Ulster Freedom
Fighters, or UFF, over the weekend. He said he was taken to a house
where he was shown the police documents and a videotape about
suspected members of the Irish Republican Army.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the 60 percent Protestant province with
the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic.
   Among those named in the police material was 28-year-old Loughlin
Maginn, who was shot to death Friday in his home in Rathfriland.
   The Ulster Freedom Fighters, a cover name for the Protestant
Ulster Defense Association, claimed it killed Maginn because he was
a member of the IRA. Maginn's family has denied the claim and said
he had been harassed by security forces for a year.
   Moore said he was told the group got the documents through a
``breach of security at security force bases,'' but he said they did
not elaborate. In his comments, Cope did not rule out that the
documents could have been stolen rather than leaked.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, or RUC, the police force of the
British province, also said it was investigating the claim.
   In his comments, Cope said, ``One can only speculate as to why
the UFF have chosen to talk to the media in this way.''
   ``Like the IRA, the UFF has every reason to hate the RUC whose
efforts have put many of its members behind bars. It is not
surprising that they will do their best to try to discredit the
police and use the media for this purpose,'' he said.
   The government of Ireland, which has a consultative role in the
province's affairs, said it was seeking an ``urgent clarification''
on the report from the British government.
   The Ulster Defense Association was formed in September 1971 as a
coordinator for paramilitary groups that supported continued British
rule of Northern Ireland.
   The Freedom Fighters group, like the IRA, is outlawed in Northern
Ireland and its members are barred from appearing on television or
radio.
   There have been past cases in which members of the Ulster Defense
Regiment, a local army unit that is being converted to a full-time
force, were involved in sectarian murders.
   In 1980, several police informers were killed after the IRA
obtained information from reserve police officers.

<HEAD>Gallery Boycott Leads to Postponement of Exhibits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boycott by some artists of the Corcoran
Gallery over its cancellation of a photography exhibit including
pictures of genitalia has led to the ``indefinite postponement'' of
two other scheduled contempory art exhibits, gallery officials said
today.
   The scheduling and then cancellation in June of the exhibit by
Robert Mapplethorpe touched off a political controversy that
resulted in Congress moving to restrict federal subsidies for
artists.
   The gallery said today contemporary artist Annette Lemieux has
pulled what it described as her ``first major one-person museum
exhibition'' scheduled to run from Oct. 28 to Dec. 31. and that six
scupltors also have canceled a show of their work scheduled to run
from next Feb. 3 to April 8.
   Deborah Shriver, a spokeswoman for the Corcoran, acknowledged
that l0 American painters, including Ms. Lemieux, featured in a
joint U.S.-Soviet exhibition to be featured next spring also have
threatened to deny the gallery the right to display their work.
   ``As far as we know, that show is still on,'' Ms. Shriver said of
the spring 1990 exhibit _ ``10 plus 10: Contemporary Soviet and
American Painters,'' a touring show arranged by the Modern Art
Museum of Fort Worth. ``But we realize that the artists are upset.''
   Ms. Lemieux notified the gallery in a letter last week that she
was withdrawing her exhibit. A week earlier, two of the six
sculptors in the exhibit titled ``The Resonance of the Odd Object,''
notified the Corcoran they were canceling their show.
   ``We believe the Corcoran, by its regrettable decision, not only
compromised its own curatorial standards, but also demonstrated its
complicity with the punishment subsequently attempted against other
art instititions,'' sculptors Buss Spector and Donald Lipski wrote.
   The Corcoran canceled the Mapplethorpe exhibit two weeks before
it was to go on display after protesting members of Congress
objected to three pictures of genitalia and homosexual activities in
it.
   The House later voted to cut the National Endowment of the Arts'
budget by $45,000 _ the total of federal grants received by
Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano, a photographer whose picture of a
crucifix in a jar of urine also touched off a protest.
   And the Senate last month approved legislation by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., that would prohibit federal financng of sexually
explict artwork.
   ``This is what we feared from day one,'' Christina Orr-Cahall,
the Corcoran's director, told The Washington Post. ``We're in the
middle of the storm.''

<HEAD>Group Says Fat-Laden Foods Barrier to Healthy School Lunches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Free ``fat-laden foods'' given to schools by
the Agriculture Department are key obstacles to healthy school lunch
programs, a consumer nutrition group said today.
   Sixty-seven percent of the school food service directors
questioned this spring by Public Voice for Food and Health Policy
said the USDA's commodity distribution program is one of the most
significant barriers to their efforts to provide nutritious meals.
   The school lunch programs depend upon commodities provided free
of charge by the federal government to help them stay afloat
financially, ``yet the commodities offered include a high proportion
of fat-laden foods,'' said the report, which is a followup to
previous studies assessing the progress being made to reduce fat in
school lunches.
   Scott Dunn, acting administator of USDA's Food and Nutrition
Service, said the department is committed to dietary guidelines
developed jointly with the Department of Health and Human Services.
   But he said the guidelines don't set quantitative standards for
fat, and ``there is no scientific consensus on appropriate levels of
fat in children's diets.''
   More than 80 percent of the directors agreed that efforts are
needed to reduce fat in their school lunches and said they have
taken some steps toward that end.
   Yet many of the directors said they were unaware that most health
authorities agree that fat in children's diets should be reduced to
about 30 percent of calories, Public Voice said. Twenty-eight
percent were uncertain of the proper average level of fat in school
lunches.
   ``The U.S. Department of Agriculture has provided only limited
guidance to the directors on how to cut back on fat to achieve this
level, such as through comprehensive hands-on training in meal
preparation or guidance on working with food suppliers,'' said the
study.
   Other findings included:
   _Only 6 percent of the directors have established target levels
or ranges for fat in their programs. Central city school districts
are eight times more likely to establish such limits than are rural
districts.
   _Twenty-three percent of those questioned said they did not
receive any guidance or guidelines on how to purchase foods or
modify recipes to reduce fat. The rest reported having limited
access to written materials or training programs.
   _When asked to identify the single most important thing that
could be done to help reduce fat, 50 percent said change the
commodity program and 26 percent said provide nutrition education.
   Public Voice recommended that the Agriculture Department provide
greater leadership in educating school food service directors and in
offering assistance in planning monthly menus, including suggesting
how often specific foods should be served.
   The USDA also should significantly expand the availability of
lower-fat commodities to the schools, the group added.
   Dunn said ``it is important to remember that no matter what level
is deemed appropriate, that level must be applied to a person's
entire diet, not to a single food or a single meal. USDA cannot at
this time support setting quantitative fat standards or recommended
frequency of serving certain foods.''
   The variety of foods donated to schools is under constant review,
he said in a statement, adding that ``over the years significant
progress has been made in providing more and more healthy, wholesome
foods, including additional low-and reduced-fat foods.''
   In addition, the agency promotes and coordinates nutrition
education and technical assistance for all involved in the school
lunch program, he said. But states ``have great flexibility in how
they spend the money they have available for training.''
   ``Technical assistance and educational materials have recently
been revised and distributed to school food service directors,''
Dunn said. ``These include recipe cards, a commodity foods
newsletter and information on fat and cholesterol.''

   Three more judges resigned in Medellin,
the nation's cocaine capital, after threats were made by drug lords
seeking to halt a government crackdown on narcotics trafficking,
authorities said today.
   Also today, Medellin Mayor Juan Gomez Martinez put the city under
a 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew to help combat the string of bombings and
other attacks that have plagued the city.
   The resignations of three more judges brought to 108 the number
of judges who have quit since the traffickers vowed Aug. 18 to
retaliate against the government, police, journalists and others
seen as a threat to the drug empire.
   The traffickers have said they will kill 10 judges for every
Colombian extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug
charges.
   The Medellin magistrates, who resigned on Tuesday, had been
investigating slayings believed to have been ordered by drug
traffickers.
   The government, meanwhile, was reported to be preparing to
extradite to the United States the first drug figure since the
traffickers' terror campaign began two weeks ago.
   The effort to extradite Eduardo Martinez Romero, an alleged money
manager for the traffickers, is seen a key test of Colombia's will
to battle the drug barons. He was arrested in the first days of an
unprecedented offensive against trafficking, which began after
gunmen hired by the cartel assassinated presidential hopeful Sen.
Luis Carlos Galan on Aug. 18.
   The syndicated TV news program ``Noticiero 24 Horas'' reported
the Colombian government notified Martinez on Tuesday of plans to
extradite him to the United States. He was told he had five working
days, or until next Tuesday, to appeal.
   A U.S. narcotics official had said earlier that the paperwork was
going forward on an extradition request for Martinez, a 35-year-old
economist who faces federal charges in Atlanta in a $1.2 billion
operation for laundering cocaine profits. He is being held under
heavy guard by the investigations division of Colombia's national
police force.
   The television did not cite a source for its report. A
presidential spokesman said he could not give any information, and
the U.S. Embassy refuses to comment on extradition prceedings.
   President Virgilio Barco re-established the country's extradition
treaty as part of a series of emergency measures in the drug
crackdown. In raids nationwide, police have seized more than $200
million in real estate including luxurious homes and office
buildings, and other property such as airplanes, helicopters and
cars. About 11,000 people have been taken into custody.
   Drug traffickers in turn have declared war on the state and
responded with a wave of bombings and burnings, mostly in of
Medellin, 215 miles north of Bogota and the base for the world's
largest cocaine trafficking cartel.
   Jorge Ochoa Restrepo, father of three alleged kingpins in the
Medellin cartel, Tuesday appealed in a letter to President Barco:
``Let there be dialogue, let there be peace.''
   The nation's communications minister, Carlos Lemos Simonds,
responded by telling reporters: ``There will be no dialogue.''
   Pablo Escobar Gaviria, reputed leader of the Medellin cartel,
said Colombia's drug lords are prepared for total war if the
government refuses to make peace, the French newspaper Liberation
said.
   He proposed ending the violence in comments over the weekend to a
government agent, said the Paris daily, which did not say how it
obtained excerpts of the purported conversation.
   According to Liberation, Escobar is in hiding in his refuge in
Magdalena Rio in the country's Amazonian cocaine-processing region.
   He reportedly said drug traffickers would be willing to let the
government keep all the property it has seized if narcotics
chieftains were allowed to rejoin society.
   If the government declines the peace offer, Liberation quoted him
as saying, ``There will be some deaths, always more deaths. I will
give orders. Some journalists and some magistrates _ they will
pay.'' fe U449 Medellin police said Tuesday night they broke up a
planned rocket attack on the state-run distillery that serves the
stores.
   The liquor business is a rich source of patronage for Medellin's
leading politicians, who have been a principle target in the drug
traffiker's terror campaign.
   A police spokesman said in a telephone interview that officers
acting on a tip went to the distillery and found four imported,
high-powered rockets. They were set up and aimed at the distillery's
highly flammable alcohol storage tank, the spokesman said, who asked
not to be identified.
   The police spokesman said the rockets were similar to those found
near a university when police frustrated an attempt to kill
presidential hopeful Galan in Medellin on Aug. 5.
   Galan was gunned down two weeks later at a political rally
outside Bogota. The slaying capped a 48-hour wave of assassinations
that shocked officials and prompted the anti-narcotics offensive.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission should
disregard a request by operators of the Seabrook nuclear power plant
that they not be graded on an emergency exercise scheduled next
month, the NRC staff says.
   Operators of the long-delayed, $6.1 billion plant asked the NRC
early this month not to grade the Sept. 27 drill, saying plant foes
will object to any ruling on the test and further delay commercial
operation with an ``endless loop'' of litigation.
   Similar drills in the past few years have been followed by a
lengthy process of appeals and challenges.
   But the NRC staff said in documents released today that there is
no basis for plant operator New Hampshire Yankee's fear. The staff
also said Seabrook employees have not recently demonstrated their
ability to handle emergencies.

<HEAD>Conservationist Sir Peter Scott Dead at 79</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Peter Scott, a war hero and Olympic yachtsman
who became one of the world's leading advocates of wildlife
protection, has died, his environmental group said today. He was 79.
   The prominent conservationist suffered a heart attack Tuesday
while visiting the western England city of Bristol and died there,
said the Wildlife and Wetlands Trust at Slimbridge on the Severn
River estuary where Scott lived.
   Scott, who was a founder of the World Wildlife Fund, would have
been 80 on Sept. 14.
   He was two years old when his father, Capt. Robert Falcon Scott,
died in the Antarctic snows in 1912 after being beaten to the South
Pole by a Norwegian, Roald Amundsen.
   Capt. Scott left a note to his wife in his hut saying, ``Make the
boy interested in natural history; it is better than games .. . Make
him a strenuous man.''
   His son said in later life that he felt having a hero for a
father meant he had to do well in different fields by his own
unaided effort.
   After studying art in Munich and London, Scott became a
celebrated bird artist, exhibiting in London and New York. The royal
family owns some of his paintings.
   He was an Olympic bronze medalist yachtsman in 1936 and three
times decorated commander of destroyers and gunboats in World War
II, when he also designed the camouflage adopted by the British
Admiralty for all ships on duty in the Atlantic Ocean.
   He was a champion glider pilot, America's Cup helmsman in 1964
and the first Briton to be knighted, in 1973, for services to
conservation. He wrote 18 books on natural history, illustrated 20
books by other authors and published three volumes of travel diaries
and an autobiography, ``The Eye of the Wind,'' in 1961.
   Scott was prominent in the movement to save whales, describing
the whaling nations as ``international hooligans.''
   In 1949, he explored the unmapped Perry River area of the
Canadian Arctic and led expeditions of naturalists to Iceland,
Australasia, the Galapagos and Seychelles Islands and three times to
the Antarctic.
   Scott said he founded his wildfowl trust in 1946 as a haven for
migrating geese and other water birds after shooting a goose and
seeing it slowly die.
   ``I thought I wouldn't do that to my worst enemy so why should I
do it to a goose,'' he recalled.
   In 1961, Scott was one of the founders of the World Wildlife
Fund, now known as the World Wide Fund for Nature, and designed its
panda logo.
   ``The fact that the fund has gone from strength to strength and
become the largest voluntary conservation organization in the world
is a tribute to Sir Peter's vision, energy and determination,'' said
George Medley, director of the fund's British arm.
   In February, Scott was named Conservationist of the Year by the
U.S. magazine, Wildlife Art News.
   In May he was presented with the Conservation Medal of the
National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C.
   Scott is survived by his wife, Philippa Talbot-Ponsonby, and
their son and daugther, and by a daughter from a previous marriage.

   The Gaza Strip's largest city was closed today
by a general strike protesting the death of a Palestinian uprising
activist who was shot by Israeli soldiers.
   In Khan Yunis, also in the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers opened
fire during a stone-throwing demonstration, wounding nine
Palestinians, Arab reports said.
   The wounded included two 12-year-old boys shot in the legs with
plastic bullets and a 22-year-old shot twice in the stomach,
hospital officials said.
   An army spokesman said two soldiers also were injured when they
were hit by stones thrown by demonstrators.
   In the West Bank, the military government completed the reopening
of schools, which were closed for much of the 20-month-old
Palestinian uprising, by allowing 10th and 11th grade students to
return to class.
   In Gaza City, stores and businesses were closed following the
death Tuesday of Ismail Abu Jayyab, 27, who was the leader of a
PLO-backed students group at the closed Islamic University. He had
been jailed four times without charges during the uprising.
   Masked youths set tires ablaze and threw up makeshift roadblocks
in several neighborhoods in Gaza City, which has a population of
nearly 200,000 people. The town of Deir El-Balah, where Jayyab was
from, also was shut by a strike.
   No casualties were reported in the protest, but a 39-year-old
municipal worker was shot several times by unknown assailants in
Gaza City. He was transferred to an Israeli hospital for surgery.
   After Jayyab's death Tuesday, Palestinian witnesses said he was
shot by soldiers after a firebomb was thrown at a military vehicle
and during stone throwing at troops in downtown Palestine Square.
The army said he was killed by army fire during a disturbance.
   The English-language Jerusalem Post quoted a witness as saying
Jayyab was shot in the face at close range.
   Officials at Shifa hospital, where the wounded Jayyab was brought
by soldiers, said he died of a single bullet wound above the right
eye.
   His death brought to 544 the number of Palestinians killed by
soldiers or Israeli civilians during the uprising. At least 100
other Palestinians were slain by fellow Arab as alleged
collaborators with Israel. Thirty-eight Israeli also have been
killed.
   In the occupied West Bank, the army reported no violence as about
45,000 students returned to high school classes for the first time
since January.
   The army closed all schools in the West Bank early in the
uprising, keeping more than 300,000 students from class. Officials
maintained the schools served as hotbeds for organizing
stone-throwing protests against soldiers.
   Schools were opened briefly twice, but each time they were shut
again under military order.
   The latest phased re-opening, which started July 22, came
following complaints by the United States and human rights groups
that closure of schools was unfairly depriving Palestinian youths of
an education.
   Schools remained open in the Gaza Strip throughout the uprising,
except for individual institutions shut for brief periods following
disturbances. Since West Bank classes resumed, the army has closed
several individual schools where protests broke out.

   A judge today ordered state officials to
release a carpenter who has been jailed for 18 months under the
state's 156-year-old sodomy law after he admitted having oral sex
with his wife.
   DeKalb County Superior Judge Robert Castellani ordered the state
to free James Moseley on his own recognizance by 3 p.m. unless a
satisfactory reason for keeping him in jail is found.
   Moseley, 35, was convicted in February 1988 on one charge of
sodomy and sentenced to five years in prison after he testified that
he engaged in oral sex with Bette Roberts, his common-law wife of
four years. The couple have since divorced, and Ms. Roberts won
custody of their two children.
   Castellani ruled that Moseley be freed until it could be
determined if he should have a new trial or if his conviction should
be overturned.
   Moseley, of Clayton County, was charged with two counts of rape,
two counts of aggravated oral sodomy and two counts of aggravated
anal sodomy in connection with two encounters with Ms. Roberts. He
was acquitted of those charges, but a jury found him guilty of
sodomy because of his admission on the witness stand.
   Sodomy, even between a consenting husband and wife, is a felony
in Georgia. Moseley is believed to be the first man convicted under
the sodomy law for conduct between marriage partners.
   In today's hearing, Clive Stafford Smith, an attorney for the
American Civil Liberties Union, argued that state prosecutors should
be required to disqualify themselves from the case if they had
engaged in oral sex.
   Castellani declined to order prosecutors to reveal such
information.
   The judge gave Moseley's attorneys until Tuesday to review
transcripts from the original trial and to file additional motions
in the case. They were seeking a writ of habeas corpus which, if
granted, would void Moseley's conviction and free him. Failing that,
he wants a new trial.
   Steven E. Lister, Moseley's original lawyer, testified today that
he advised Moseley not to appeal the conviction because he believed
an appeal would delay a release from the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles.
   Smith argued that Lister's advice effectively deprived Moseley of
his right to appeal.
   Senior Assistant Attorney General Mary Beth Westmoreland said the
state was not trying to interfere in private marital relations, but
became involved because of Ms. Roberts' contention that she did not
consent to the acts.

<TEXT>
   A human rights group today protested the
government's arrest of more than 50 journalists, lawyers and
activists and charged that some of the detainees have been tortured.
   Bahi el-Din Hussein, deputy chief of the Geneva-based Arab Human
Rights Organization's Egyptian chapter, alleged that the prisoners
were beaten with cattle prods.
   Attorney General Abdel-Meguid Mahmoud said his department was
investigating claims by detainees that they were tortured, but he
refused to elaborate.
   Authorities arrested 55 journalists, lawyers and activists last
week for allegedly taking part in a Communist conspiracy.
   More than 300 of the roughly 400 journalists working for the
state-run newspaper Al-Ahram have signed petitions seeking the
release of their colleague, Mohammed el-Said Saeed, and two
journalists from the leftist opposition weekly Al-Ahali.
   The arrest of Saeed was the first time a reporter from one of
Cairo's three government-owned newspapers has been arrested since
President Hosni Mubarak took office in 1981.
   The protest by his colleagues at the state-run newspaper is
highly unusual. The newspapers are not censored outright, but unlike
the opposition press, they almost never criticize security policies
or activities in their news or editorial columns.
   The three journalists were arrested Aug. 24 along with 52 other
people in crackdowns on what security officials described as ``an
underground Communist Party.''
   The detainees include three lawyers and several workers, who
authorities said were arrested with documents ``inciting change in
the country's social and political system.''
   Hussein told The Associated Press the alleged torture occurred
Monday in prison. He said two rows of security policemen flanked the
detainees, beat them with electric cattle prods and dragged
journalist Saeed across the floor.
   He said Saeed was tortured so badly that the prison warden was
reluctant to let him meet the visiting head of the Press Syndicate,
magazine editor Makram Mohammed Ahmed. The syndicate is the
professional organization of Egyptian journalists.
   Amina Shafik, the syndicate's secretary-general and Saeed's
colleague at Al-Ahram, concurred that the detainees had been beaten.
   ``Some of them have been hurt,'' she said. She said, however,
that when she visited on Tuesday, Saeed looked well.
   Mrs. Shafik said the protest petitions do not refer to beatings
or torture but urge ``improved treatment and release'' of the three
journalists. She said 1988 Nobel Prize-winning writer Naguib
Mahfouz, a regular columnist at Al-Ahram, also signed the petition
for presentation to ``various government points.''
   Ahmed said he had seen no signs of torture but nevertheless
demanded from prison officials ``better treatment and regular visits
by a doctor. I'm sure treatment has improved now.''
   He said Saeed had been on a hunger strike and was in hysterics
when he visited him Monday. Ahmed said he persuaded Saeed to end the
strike.

   The construction of the first Jewish
synagogue in Yugoslavia since World War II will begin soon in the
Croatian capital of Zagreb, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   It will stand at the site of a synagogue destroyed in 1941 by the
Croatian Ustashas, a Nazi puppet regime, the Vecernje Novosti
newspaper said. The original 74-year-old building was the biggest
synagogue in the Balkans.
   Jews from Israel, the United States and Yugoslavia are expected
to pay for the construction of the synagogue, which will be a part
of a Jewish Cultural Center, according to Slavko Goldstein,
president of the Zagreb Jewish Community. No date was given for the
start of construction.
   Before World War II, there were about 82,000 Jews in Yugoslavia.
As many as 67,000 were killed by the Nazis, while 9,000 emigrated to
Israel between 1948 and 1950. There are about 6,500 Jews in
Yugoslavia today.
   A memorial to Jewish victims of World War II also is planned in
Belgrade.

   Telephone and mail service was disrupted
Wednesday, the second day of a strike by 1,500 postal and
communications workers.
   Riot police stood outside post offices in the capital after
Witness Mangwende, the minister for Information, Posts and
Telecommunications, declared the stoppage illegal and ordered the
strikers back to work.
   The strike began Tuesday, with workers asking that their starting
pay be doubled. Months of negotiations have failed to resolve the
dispute.
   Under emergency powers invoked by the government earlier this
month, strikes by workers in essential services such as
communications are outlawed, with violators risking dismissal, as
well as a prison sentence of two years and a fine of about $450.
   No action was taken against the strikers by late Wednesday
despite Mangwende's warning.
   The protesters include most Harare telephone operators and
communications technicians. Hundreds of telex machines were
paralyzed and operator-service telephone calls were suspended.
Incoming direct-dial telephone calls were still being received.

<TEXT>
   Finland is convening an environmental
conference on the arctic, a meeting made possible by changing Soviet
attitudes toward ecology, a Foreign Ministry official said Wednesday.
   ``The Soviets used to consider pollution a capitalistic vice, but
no longer, and they have shown a willingness to reduce their own
trans-boundary pollution in the Kola Peninsula,'' said the official,
Esko Rajaskoski. ``Three or four years ago such a conference would
have been impossible.''
   The Sept. 20-26 conference will be attended by all eight nations
with territory above the Arctic Circle: the United States, Canada,
the Soviet Union, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Finland and Denmark,
which is responsible for Greenland.
   ``The environmental damage in the arctic is much more extensive
than we expected and there has not been near enough research in this
area,'' said Olli Paasivirta of Finland's Environment Ministry.
   Oil and gas exploration, refining and transportation, as well as
chemical and heavy metal discharges, are causing problems for some
animal and plant life in the region, Paasivirta said.

   Hotel queen Leona Helmsley was convicted today of
tax evasion for charging personal expenses to her businesses but was
acquitted of the most serious charge against her, extortion
conspiracy.
   She was found guilty of 33 of the 41 federal counts on which she
was tried. The counts on which she was convicted related to evading
$1.2 million in taxes from 1983 to 1985.
   Mrs. Helmsley, who with her husband runs a multibillion-dollar
real estate empire, showed little emotion while the jury foreman
read off the verdict, but occasionally shook her head.
   Her co-defendants, former aides Frank Turco and Joseph Licari,
were convicted of assisting in the tax-evasion scheme. Turco, who
had been charged in the extortion conspiracy, was also acquitted on
that charge.
   All three also were acquitted on mail fraud charges.
   Each of the 33 counts Mrs. Helmsley was convicted on carries a
maximum prison term of three or five years. She could also face
fines as high as $8 million. The extortion conspiracy charge carried
a 20-year maximum sentence.
   Mrs. Helmsley was allowed to remain free on bail pending
sentencing Nov. 14. The judge and lawyers went into conference after
the verdict was announced. As she waited, Mrs. Helmsley slumped in
her chair, occasionally talking with her bodyguard, grandson and
niece.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, was depicted at the trial as arrogant,
penny-pinching and mean-spirited. Her former housekeeper testified
that Mrs. Helmsley once told her, ``We don't pay taxes. Only the
little people pay taxes.''
   Her 80-year-old husband, Harry, was charged in the April 1988
indictment but was not tried because the judge found him mentally
incompetent.
   The verdict came in the fifth day of deliberations in U.S.
District Court.
   The bulk of the expenses on which the tax charges were based were
$3.1 million in renovations and operating costs at the lavish
Greenwich, Conn., mansion, Dunnellen Hall, which the Helmsleys
purchased for $11 million in June 1983.
   Many of the bills were altered to make it appear the work was
done at corporate entities. Prosecutors contended that the phony
bills resulted in unreported income on the Helmsleys personal tax
returns and incorrect business deductions on the corporate returns.
   The expenses included more than $1 million for a pool enclosure
with a marble dance floor on the roof, jade figures worth $500,000,
a $130,000 indoor-outdoor sound system similar to one Mrs. Helmsley
had admired in Disney World and thousands of dollars in landscaping
work.
   The prosecution also alleged that $320,172 in Mrs. Helmsley's
personal purchases were charged to the Park Lane Hotel, one of
several luxury Helmsley hotels in Manhattan.
   These items ranged from tens of thousands of dollars in designer
clothing to an $8 purchase of underwear. Another item was a $45,000
silver clock specially designed in the shape of the Helmsley
Building, a birthday present to Helmsley from his wife.
   During the trial, the hotel's former comptroller quoted Turco as
saying the accounting system at the Park Lane was the ``Helmsley
cheat-the-government system.''
   The extortion conspiracy charge alleged that three liquor sales
representatives were forced to kick back a percentage of their sales
to keep accounts at Helmsley hotels.
   A former Helmsley executive, Milton Meckler, testified that Turco
once held up several envelopes and said, ``This is cash. This is
what Mrs. Helmsley wants.''
   The extortion charge also covered three televisions for Dunnellen
Hall that were allegedly extorted from the RCA Corp. while it was
seeking a lucrative contract with her Cleveland-based Harley Hotel
chain.
   Meckler testified that Mrs. Helmsley joked with him, ``How many
more can I get?''
   Many of the 44 prosecution witnesses helped paint the harsh
personal portrait of Mrs. Helmsley that emerged during the
eight-week trial.
   They described how she fired employees at the slightest
provocation, disputed bills and always sought the lowest price.
   Defense attorney Gerald Feffer attempted to discredit the
witnesses as disgruntled ex-employees who had a vendetta against
Mrs. Helmsley, whom he described as tough and abrasive.
   Feffer had argued that the Helmsleys did nothing wrong in billing
their companies for part of the expenses at Dunnellen Hall because
they used the estate for business.
   He tried to explain away the phony bills by saying her employees
devised the scheme to avoid contact with Mrs. Helmsley, who many
times refused to pay contractors if she was not fully satisfied with
their work.
   Feffer had repeatedly pointed out that the Helmsleys paid $57.8
million in taxes during the time period of the indictment.
   The defense presented testimony from four witnesses, including
two tax experts who said the Helmsleys actually overpaid $591,000 in
federal taxes in 1983-85 by underreporting the depreciation of
buildings in Helmsley-controlled partnerships.

   Two passenger trains collided head-on in
western Austria today, killing at least one person and injuring 27
people, a railway spokesman said.
   Three cars derailed when the trains crashed while traveling at
relatively low speeds between Bregenz, capital of Voralberg
province, and the small town of Wolfurt, the spokesman said.
   Authorities found one body in the wreckage. The Austria Press
Agency identified the victim as Alfred Rainer Heller, a 48-year-old
engineer from Bodolz, West Germany.
   Sixteen people, including the drivers of each train, were
hospitalized and 11 other people treated for slight injuries, a
railroad spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   The spokesman said 72 passengers were on the ``Montfort,'' the
express train between Bregenz and Vienna; and 75 were on the
``Bavaria,'' the express train between Munich and Zurich.
   The railway spokesman said it seemed that human error was
probably to blame since the ``Montfort'' had been erroneously
switched to the same track as the other train.
   The crash occurred in Voralberg near the site of a train accident
that killed five people and injured 46 exactly one year ago, on Aug.
29, 1988.

<HEAD>Chess-Playing Computers are Gaining On Humans, Researcher Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University say
they have bad news for international chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov
_ computers could overtake the best human players in just a few
years.
   ``I'd say four years is a very generous estimate, in fact,'' said
CMU computer scientist Hans Berliner, the brains behind Hitech, a
computer that won its third straight Pennsylvania State Championship
over the weekend in Lancaster.
   Hitech's five-game sweep at the tournament raised its U.S. Chess
Federation ranking to 2,411, up about 400 points from the rating it
achieved after it began playing in 1985.
   Kasparov, the world champion, ranks above 2,800. A beginner
typically rates about 1,200.
   Hitech is winning about 80 percent of its games and ranks among
the top 150 players in the United States but never has beaten a
grandmaster, the federation's highest rank.
   Berliner and a changing team of graduate students have worked
since 1985 to boost Hitech's speed and ability.
   ``Any person who can improve 100 points a year will probably
become a world champion very soon,'' Berliner said Tuesday.
``Getting up to 2,000 is not something many players achieve.''
   Hitech isn't even the fastest or most powerful chess computer. It
ranks second in the world, behind another Carnegie Mellon creation,
Deep Thought, Berliner said.
   ``It's becoming fairly obvious that Deep Thought, which is 20
times faster than Hitech, already can play with the best players in
the country. It's not going to take too much more improvement,'' he
said.
   Many of the best human chess players are turning down invitations
to match wits against machines in tournament play, however.
   Four of the players seeded above sixth-seeded Hitech declined to
play the computer at the state championship. The fifth person lost.
Participants in tournaments don't have to play a computer if they
don't want to.
   ``When we were first being invited to play, it was for fun.
Nobody expected it to win,'' Berliner said. But he added, ``Players
are starting to refuse to play because it's no longer an easy
touch.''
   The best human players rely on experience, intuition and
knowledge of chess theory.
   Computers play mathematically, computing the consequences of
various moves. Hitech can consider more than 175,000 board positions
per second before picking the best one. Hitech also can recognize
patterns of moves.
   Computer chess is advancing the field of artificial intelligence,
and lessons learned could help humans make complex judgments in
other areas of life, Berliner said.
   ``When they invented the steam shovel, the people who dug ditches
also were very upset,'' he said. ``But look at what a great
improvement that turned out to be.''

   Algeria and Pakistan are blocking Israel's attempt
to join an international conference on chemical weapons, an Israeli
diplomat said today.
   Israel in June submitted its application to join the 40-nation
Conference on Disarmament, which officially accepts new participants
only by consensus. The conference concludes its summer session
Thursday.
   Pinhas Eliav, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in
Geneva, said officials told him that Algeria, ``helped to a certain
degree by Pakistan,'' opposed Israel's bid for observer status. The
two other Arab members, Egypt and Morocco, did not raise objections,
he added.
   The request still is pending, and Israel plans to pursue it when
delegates reconvene in February.
   ``We didn't want to press it too much because we didn't think it
was worth it,'' Eliav told The Associated Press. ``We didn't want to
fight it out.''
   Israeli officials say one reason for the application is concern
over the spread of chemical weapons in the Middle East.
   Western diplomats will lobby Arab delegations in the conference
recess in an effort to obtain a consensus because ``it would not be
productive'' to force the issue to a vote now, U.S. Ambassador Max
Friedersdorf said.
   Eliav suggested Algeria was retaliating for Israeli and Western
moves to keep the Palestine Liberation Organization from gaining
full membership in international organizations.
   Among the 22 non-members participating in the chemical weapons
talks are Iraq, Syria and Libya, all believed to have chemical arms
capabilities. Israel is believed to have stocks of nerve gas and
mustard gas.
   The disarmament conference has been debating a global convention
outlawing the production, stockpiling and use of chemical arms.
   Several new observers joined this year after a special 149-nation
conference on chemical weapons in Paris attempted to spur the
negotiations on a draft treaty.
   Delegates on Tuesday reported that the latest round made progress
on technical points but again failed to remove major stumbling
blocks, including disagreements over verification.

   Widespread thievery has deprived Chinese officials
of one of their most treasured privileges: access to telephones that
work.
   The Worker's Daily said Wednesday that 420 miles of telephone
line have been stolen this year in the southern island province of
Hainan, and that lines or equipment have been damaged in 18 Hainan
cities.
   It said thieves have preyed on the exclusive lines linking
government offices. The lines are far clearer than the static-filled
lines used by ordinary citizens.
   An important line from the southern Hainan city of Sanya to the
provincial government in Haikou was cut for two months from
February, and then cut again after it was repaired in April.
   The thieves, mostly peasants who sell the copper wire, made off
with 37{ miles of a 49-mile stretch between Sanya and Tongshi and 69
out of 87{ miles of line linking another two towns.
   When the provincial government tried to hold a telephone
conference with Tongshi city on Aug. 17, it found the line was dead,
the report said. Officials switched to a backup line that worked for
only eight minutes before being cut by thieves.

<HEAD>British Report To Release CIA File, Reject Waldheim Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unpublished British report rejects testimony
by Austrian President Kurt Waldheim to the Justice Department and
includes a secret CIA file which identifies Waldheim as a Nazi
intelligence officer, the World Jewish Congress said Wednesday.
   The British Defense Ministry announced Tuesday that the report,
ordered by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to determine whether
Waldheim was linked to the execution of six British commandos in
World War II, will be released in a few weeks.
   Speculation has arisen in London that some evidence may be
suppressed because of possible post-war links between Waldheim and
British and U.S. intelligence services.
   But World Jewish Congress executive director Elan Steinberg said
he has learned the report will include a CIA file of April 26, 1945,
which contains an interrogation conducted by British military
intelligence of a Nazi officer who identified Waldheim as an
intelligence officer.
   Steinberg's organization found out about the file by petitioning
the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act. But he said that the
agency refused to release the document because it was obtained from
British intelligence.
   The file proves that British and U.S. authorities knew about
Waldheim's Nazi past when they supported his nomination for U.N.
secretary general in the 1970s, he added.
   Waldheim was elected president in 1986 and placed on a list of
undesirable foreigners by the Justice Department, which found he had
``assisted and otherwise participated'' in deportation of Jewish
prisoners to death camps and execution of Allied prisoners.
   An international commission of historians appointed by the
Austrian government found Waldheim lied about his activities in
World War II and knew about Nazi atrocities but did nothing to stop
them.
   The commission said it could not prove a connection between
Waldheim and the British commandos captured in the Balans in 1944,
but suggested he knew they were shot by the Gestapo after their
interrogation by Nazi intelligence officers.
   In written testimony presented by his lawyers to the Justice
Department, Waldheim denied taking part in any interrogations,
saying no questioning of prisoners was conducted at the field
headquarters where he was stationed near the Greek town of Saloniki.
   But the British report shows the commandos were interrogated at
the headquarters where Waldheim served and that some of them were
subsequently handed over to the Gestapo for ``special handling,''
the euphemism for execution, Steinberg said.
   Among documents made available to the British investigation are
papers with Waldheim's initials showing he was clearly aware the
commandos were handed over to the Gestapo, Steinberg said.
   He said the World Jewish Congress had gleaned its information
about the British report from documents it had supplied at the
investigators' request and from people who have seen the completed
findings.
   The report will not make any judgment of criminality about
Waldheim's activities, Steinberg said.

   A witness testifying in PTL founder Jim
Bakker's fraud and conspiracy trial collapsed on the stand today
during questioning, and court was recessed for the day after
paramedics carried him out on a stretcher.
   Steve Nelson, a former PTL executive, had testified before
becoming ill that the ministry was so overbooked with ``lifetime
partnerships'' that he warned Bakker and former aide Richard Dortch
that they could go to prison for the programs.
   The partnership programs promised donors three nights of free
lodging each year for life in exchange for $1,000 donations to PTL.
   ``I told them I thought we had some big-time problems,'' said
Nelson. ``I specifically said, `Someone could go to jail for this.'''
   Dortch responded that PTL officials had checked out the
partnership programs with South Carolina officials and were assured
that no laws had been broken, said Nelson, who became PTL's vice
president for world outreach in 1985.
   During cross examination, Nelson collapsed on the stand and fell
to the floor. A member of the jury and an artist from the press
section rushed to help him
   Bakker sat at the defense table until his attorney called him
over to Nelson's side. Bakker appeared to be praying over Nelson,
who quickly regained consciousness.
   Sue Patterson, the courtroom artist who came to Nelson's aid,
said he told her he hadn't eaten in several days. After paramedics
took Nelson away on a stretcher, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter
recessed court for the day.
   Bakker is on trial on federal charges of fraud and conspiracy.
Prosecutors say he and other PTL executives diverted more than $4
million of the $158 million raised through partnership programs to
their own uses.
   Dortch, 57, agreed on Aug. 8 to plead guilty to two counts of
wire fraud and one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy. The plea
bargain came three weeks before he was scheduled to stand trial with
Bakker. Dortch was sentenced Aug. 24 to eight years in prison and
fined $200,000.
   Dortch, expected to be a key witness in the trial, was himself
hospitalized in Florida for undisclosed reasons. Dortch had also
been admitted in April to Morton Plant Hospital, in Clearwater,
Fla., for chest pains.
   Hospital spokesman Paul Gramblin said today that Dortch, who
lives in Safety Harbor, Fla., asked doctors not disclose details of
his condition.
   Robert Dash of the U.S. attorney's office refused to discuss the
effects of Dortch's hospitalization on the proceedings. He said
Dortch was not expected to be called this week.
   Prosecution witnesses Tuesday portrayed Jim Bakker as an
evangelist of extravagance, but attorneys for the PTL founder say he
was a busy minister concerned with saving souls.
   David Taggart, a former aide to Bakker convicted of tax evasion,
testified that the televangelist pursued an extravagant lifestyle
and was enchanted with real estate.
   ``He told me he wanted to have 10 homes,'' Taggart said.
   Hollis Rule, a former computer programmer for PTL, testified he
went to his superiors with concerns that the partnerships were
oversold, numbering 64,000 in September 1985 despite Bakker's
self-imposed limit of 25,000.
   Richard Ball, a PTL vice president, testified he relayed those
concerns to Bakker and another executive during a brief meeting at
the ministry's television studio.
   ``They told me not to worry about it,'' Ball said.
   Former PTL advertising writer Lois Chalmers testified that a
campaign for the partnerships offered a David and Goliath sculpture
said to be worth $1,000. But the ministry only paid $10 for them,
she said. A silver version of the sculpture in Bakker's office might
have been worth $1,000, she said.
   Taggart testified that Bakker always accepted bonuses from the
board, even after objecting to them. The board in 1985 approved
borrowing $800,000 for operating expenses while voting Bakker a
$200,000 bonus, Taggart said.
   Bakker complained during a visit to Oral Roberts University in
Tulsa, Okla., that he didn't live as well as other evangelists,
Taggart said.
   ``They were showing us around,'' he said. ``Mr. Bakker said that
he lived shabbily compared to Oral Roberts, the (Rex) Humbards and
other ministers.''
   Taggart said electric bills at Bakker's lakefront parsonage in
Tega Cay, S.C., usually ran about $1,800 to $2,000 a month because
``the pool was kept at a very high temperature ... in the 90s.''
   The witness also recounted moving the Bakkers' clothing and other
belongings in 1984 from Tega Cay to a house they owned in Palm
Springs, Calif. He said the move was made on a private jet at a cost
to PTL of $105,000.
   After The Charlotte Observer reported on the Bakkers' extravagant
homes, vacations and vintage cars, PTL hired a private investigator
for at least $5,000 to follow the newspaper's publisher, editor and
a reporter, Charles E. Shepard. The newspaper won a Pulitzer prize
for its reporting, and Shepard has a book coming out next month on
the rise and fall of Bakker and his ministry.
   Bakker quit PTL in 1987 amid revelations about his 1980 sexual
encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn and a $265,000 payoff
for her silence.
   If convicted of all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, Bakker
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $5 million.
   Taggart and his brother James each face 25 years in prison and $1
million in fines for their tax evasion convictions. The two were
convicted in July of evading $525,000 in federal income taxes on
$1.2 million they received from PTL.
   In cross examination of Taggart, defense attorney Harold Bender
asked about PTL checklists that included subjects ranging from hotel
cleanliness and providing ministers to counsel people after a
service.
   ``So Mr. Bakker was not only taking care of the day-to-day things
at PTL _ the lights, the cleanliness _ he was also looking out for
the spiritual welfare of his congregation, wasn't he?'' Bender asked.
   ``Yes, salvation was important,'' Taggart said.

<HEAD>'Twas Scurvy Killed the King, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Henry VIII, renowned for his appetite for
women and power, was killed by his craving for meat, a historian has
concluded.
   Susan Maclean Kybett, writing in the September issue of History
Today, argues that Henry died in 1547 of scurvy, a disease caused by
a lack of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C.
   Or as the headline in Wednesday's Guardian newspaper put it:
``Henry was a scurvy knave.''
   The king, Ms. Kybett said, displayed a number of symptoms of
scurvy: swollen, ulcerated legs, bad breath, frequent colds,
constipation, lethargy, forgetfulness, bloating and wild mood swings.
   It could have been Henry, she wrote, that the Elizabethan writer
Phillip Stubbes had in mind in this blast against the English diet:
   ``For who is sicklier than they that fare deliciously every day?
Who is corrupter? Who belcheth more? Who looketh worse, who is
weaker and feebler than they? Who hath more filthy colour, phlegm
and putrifaction (replete with gross humours) than they?
   ``And, to be brief, who dyeth sooner than they?''
   Significantly, Henry was usually sick during Lent, when fasting
coincided with a lack of nutritious food, Ms. Kybett wrote.
   ``But nobody in the Tudor era associated foods with health. They
hoped in vain that the green and golden concoctions of the alchemist
would bring a cure.''
   It was once believed that Henry, who died at age 56, succumbed to
syphilis, but that theory has been discredited.
   A cure for scurvy was unknown until Dr. James Lind of Scotland
published ``A Treatment of the Scurvy'' in 1735.
   Sailors were frequent sufferers from scurvy until it was
discovered that they could be protected by citrus fruits _ hence the
term ``Limey'' for British, from the lime juice rations that were
given to seamen.
   Ms. Kybett, a native of Scotland who lives in Jackson, Mich.,
said that the English of Henry's time had no techniques for
preserving fruits and vegetables.
   Nicander Nucius, an Italian who visited England in the last two
years of Henry's life, commented on the ``sottish and unrestrained''
appetites of the natives, and another Italian at the time remarked
that fruit was scarce, ``because they lack the great heat of
summer.''
   The English, at least those who could read and afford books, had
been warned against fruits. In ``Castel of Helth,'' published in
1539, the physician Sir Thomas Elyot had warned that fruits ``do
ingender ylle humours and be oftetymes the cause of putrified
fevers, if they be moche and continually eaten.''
   Judging from armor made for Henry in later life, his waist had
ballooned to 54 inches, just 3 inches less than his chest. In his
younger days, the king had a trim 35-inch waist and a chest of 42
inches.
   Ms. Kybett said two of Henry's children, Queen Mary and Queen
Elizabeth, showed signs of scurvy, as did Henry's high-living
chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.
   Wolsey, a victim of Henry's moods, died in 1530 while going to
London to face trial for treason.
   Henry was married six times. His eagerness to divorce his first
wife, Catherine of Aragon, who had failed to bear a son,
precipitated the English church's break with Rome.

   A 94-car freight train collided with a
tractor-trailer rig today, killing two people, derailing at least 19
cars and snarling traffic for miles, police said.
   It was not immediately clear how many of the Union Pacific
freight train cars left the tracks; reports ranged from 19 to 30
cars. Many of the train's cars were empty and it was not known what
the others held. Officials said they did not contain hazardous
materials.
   Two bodies were pulled from the wreckage, both believed to have
been in the truck, which was dragged about 50 yards on impact, said
state Police Chief Charles Gruber. Their identities were not
released.
   Three people aboard the train were reported injured, although
none seriously.
   The train and truck, leased to Southeastern Frozen Foods of
Louisiana, collided about 6:20 a.m. on a major city thoroughfare,
said state police Lt. Rudy Crain.
   The accident, near the Louisiana State University-Shreveport
campus, tied up traffic in the area for miles, officials said.
Witnesses said freight cars were piled atop one other, scattered
down a hillside and stuck on the ground.
   The Shreveport Journal quoted eyewitnesses as saying the accident
occurred when the truck drove past warning lights in front of the
train.

<HEAD>Some Artists Boycott Corcoran Gallery Over Exhibit Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An artist boycott has forced the cancellation
of two scheduled exhibitions at the Corcoran Gallery, which in June
amid a swirling political controversy abruptly canceled a show that
included sexually explicit photos.
   Gallery officials said Wednesday that contemporary artist Annette
Lemieux has withdrawn her one-woman show scheduled for Oct. 28 to
Dec. 31 and that an exhibit by six sculptors scheduled for next Feb.
3 to April 8 also has been ``indefinitely postponed.''
   ``We're hoping to reschedule both at some point,'' said Deborah
Shriver, a spokeswoman for the private gallery, which has been
trying in recent years to establish itself as a showcase for
contemporary art.
   Ms. Lemieux, whose work was subsidized by the federal government
through the National Endowment of the Arts, described the withdrawal
of her show as a ``indefinite postponement ... until they (the
Corcoran) demonstrate a definite change in policy.''
   Both she and two of the six sculptors said in letters to the
gallery their decisions were based on the Corcoran's cancellation in
June of an exhibit of 150 photographs by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe, who died last March from AIDS.
   ``We believe the Corcoran, by its regrettable decision, not only
compromised its own curatorial standards, but also demonstrated it
complicity with the punishment subsequently attempted against other
art instititions,'' wrote sculptors Buss Spector and Donald Lipski.
   The Mapplethrope exhibit _ which included photographs of
children's genitalia, homoerotic and sadomasochistic images _ became
embroiled in a vehement controversy over the federal funding of
sexually explicit art through the National Endowment of the Arts.
   The exhibit, which toured several other museums, was funded
partially through a $15,000 grant by the endowment.
   Since then, congressional critics led by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., and Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, have pushed bills through the
House and Senate cutting the endowment's budget and restricting the
type of art it can fund.
   ``This is what we feared from day one,'' Christina Orr-Cahall,
the Corcoran's director told The Washington Post. ``We're in the
middle of the storm.''
   Ms. Shriver said 10 American painters, including Ms. Lemieux,
featured in a joint U.S.-Soviet exhibition to be featured next
spring also have threatened to deny the gallery the right to display
their work.
   ``As far as we know, that show is still on,'' she said of the
spring 1990 exhibit _ ``10 plus 10: Contemporary Soviet and American
Painters,'' a touring show arranged by the Modern Art Museum of Fort
Worth. ``But we realize that the artists are upset.''

<HEAD>Cambodia Peace Conference Fails</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with conference issuing final statement,

<TEXT>
   Delegates at an international conference on Cambodia
failed to produce a peace accord today and decided to suspend their
work until the warring factions are ready to compromise.
   Last-minute haggling delayed by seven hours the issuing of a
final statement that fell far short of the comprehensive settlement
delegates from 19 nations hoped to achieve when the meeting opened
in late July.
   The statement _ issued as the delegates began a last plenary
session that was expected to be brief _ said the meeting had
``achieved progress in elaborating a wide variety of elements
necessary for the reaching of a comprehensive settlement to the
tragic conflict in Cambodia.''
   But, it added, ``It is not yet possible to achieve a
comprehensive settlement. It was therefore decided to suspend the
conference.''
   France and Indonesia, whose representatives chaired the meeting,
offered to assist in mediating within the next six months between
the Vietnam-installed government of Prime Minister Hun Sen and the
three resistance factions led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the
hereditary ruler of the Southeast Asian nation.
   The delegates left open the possiblity of using the committees
set up under the auspices of the international conference as a forum
for future talks between the belligerents.
   France and Indonesia ``will begin consultations within six months
with the participants in the conference with a view to reconvening
the conference,'' the statement said.
   France called the conference when it appeared that an
international political climate of greater cooperation favored a
possible settlement.
   But over three weeks of negotiations in small working groups, the
positions among the Cambodian factions hardened.
   The failure at the negotiating table in Paris increased the
liklihood of full-scale civil war after the scheduled withdrawal of
26,000 Vietnamese troops before Sept. 27, some delegates said.
   ``It will be like Afghanistan; there will be more fighting,''
said the spokesman for the Singapore delegation, Tommy Koh. ``The
two sides are preparing for war, they're already fighting.''
   ``The parties won't come back until they've tested each other on
the battlefield and have reached an impasse,'' Koh said.
   Negotiations broke down over five points, including the
composition of a transitional government after the troop pullout, a
mechanism for monitoring the withdrawal and the use of the word
``genocide'' in describing the Khmer Rouge rule between 1975 and the
Vietnamese invasion three years later, French Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas reported. The Khmer Rouge is believed to have killed 1
million Cambodians during its rule.
   Intransigence marked the meeting up until the end, delaying the
final plenary session that was scheduled to begin in the morning but
was delayed until late afternoon.
   The points of disagreement included an item in a draft of the
final statement calling for the Cambodian parties to intensify their
``efforts to achieve national reconciliation.''
   Both China, who supports the Khmer Rouge resistance, and Sihanouk
objected to the reference national reconciliation, and the wording
was deleted.
   Their position remains that the Phnom Penh government led by Hun
Sen is strictly a Vietnamese puppet.
   In a statement released on the last day of the conference,
Sihanouk said that the resistance would reject any international
monitoring of the troop withdrawal ``before the dismantling of the
illegal regime of Phnom Penh and its replacement by a Cambodian
provisional quadrapartite government'' composed of the three
resistance members and Hun Sen.

   President Bush promised today to keep
trying ``to hold the line on taxes'' and to fight for a lower tax on
capital gains.
   Speaking to an appreciative audience of fellow residents and
merchants of this summer resort, the vacationing president appealed
for their support as he heads back to Washington next week to
grapple with Congress over taxes and the deficit.
   Bush later in the day was welcoming Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney and family to his oceanfront home, where he has spent the
past two weeks.
   Bush, standing on a blue-draped temporary platform erected on a
hotel shuffleboard court, with the rocky coastline and blue waters
of the Atlantic at his back, noted that the Kennebunk-Kennebunkport
Chamber of Commerce was composed of ``a lot of entrepreneurs.''
   ``I'd be remiss at a meeting like this if I didn't ask you to
give me strong support as I go back to Washington to fight for a
capital gains tax differential,'' he said.
   Bush wants to reduce the levy on capital gains _ profits made
from the sale of property or securities _ from 28 percent to 15
percent but has met resistence from Democrats who control Congress.
   Calling small businesses ``the backbone of this country in any
ways,'' Bush said he wants to reduce the levy to stimulate the
economy and reward ``those who have the courage to go off on their
own and start new businesses.''
   ``I do believe we're going to get a good agreement on the budget
deficit reduction package. I think it will be accomplished without
raising the taxes on the American working man,'' the president said.
   ``I am going to continue to try to hold the line on taxes,'' he
told the crowd of several hundred.
   Bush made no apologies for his 20-day vacation, which ends on
Labor Day.
   ``We are doing some work, but I have confessed at the very outset
that this is a pure, total vacation, and I'm not going to look busy
in order to convince people in America that it's something other
than a vacation,'' he said to applause. ``It's the way it is.''
   Bush also said he planned to call the editor of the Portland
Press Herald and ask him to stop running a graphic chronicling his
futility at fishing.
   He said this morning he was at the helm when a companion caught a
bluefish.
   ``I think they should knock off that advertisement on the front
of the Portland paper that shows a bluefish with a big `X' through
it telling me that yet a 13th day I haven't caught one,'' he said.
``I'm going to appeal to them on that one.''
   The president said this was a place where he and Barbara
``refurbish our souls and get our batteries all charged up and enjoy
life really to the fullest.''
   Bush has spent every summer of his life here except 1944, when he
was flying Navy bombers in the Pacific during World War II.
   A bright sun broke through the morning haze and clouds in time
for the Chamber of Commerce event.
   ``I can't wait to show off this heaven to the prime minister of
Canada, his wife and his four kids,'' he told the local boosters.
   Bush's national security adviser said Tuesday that U.S.-Canadian
relations are in good shape thanks to progress on acid rain and
trade as the two leaders hold their friendly, private visit.
   Mulroney, his wife Mila and their four children were to arrive in
late afternoon at Bush's Walker's Point compound for an overnight
visit.
   Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said Tuesday
the private visit would give the two leaders ``a chance to relax
(and) a chance to exchange views'' on world events, including the
dramatic changes in Poland as well as the crises in Lebanon and
Colombia.
   Scowcroft said the two old friends share ``a close similarity of
views ... on world affairs and a kind of unique personal closeness
and frankness in exchanging views.''
   Scowcroft said U.S.-Canadian ties are ``in basically pretty good
shape,'' with efforts under way to implement the sweeping Free Trade
Agreement signed last year by former President Reagan and Mulroney.
   He said Bush's proposed revision of the Clean Air Act, which
would seek to sharply curb emissions from utility plants, factories
and other sources of pollutants that cause acid rain, ``has set us
on the road to dealing with one of the other major problems between
us, that is the issue of cross-border pollution'' such as acid rain.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the country:
   Aug. 25
   Owatonna (Minn.) People's Press on education:
   U.S. Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos did not actually point an
accusing finger at educators and schools when he complained of
rising education costs and falling returns.
   He was careful to say parents, teachers and all Americans must
become involved if education is to succeed.
   But his underlying tone was an accusatory one _ once again, he
implied, education is falling down on the job.
   If Cavazos genuinely believes such a direct relationship can be
discerned between money spent on education and children's
achievement, he does not understand how people learn.
   It is not the fault of the education system that families break
apart and create insecure homes for kids, keeping their minds off
learning. It is not the fault of the educational system that
children are abused, throwing up barriers to learning. It is not the
fault of the educational system that teen-agers get pregnant and, to
compound the problem, try to raise their babies themselves, in
poverty.
   A failure in education is a failure in society as a whole. We
cannot mend our school system until we mend our social failings. It
is a cyclical relationship; to a large degree, education is the
answer to our social failings.
   The circuit breaker we need is in the cycle of poverty and crime,
not in the money we spend on education.
   Then again, it is possible that Cavazos realizes these
complexities. If so, he is playing politics with children's futures
and that is unforgivable.

   The News Tribune, Woodbridge, N.J., on the cost of AZT:
   The encouraging news that the drug AZT will stall the deadly
effect of the AIDS virus is dampened by the news that the bill for
this drug might approach $5 billion annually.
   Should limited public funds be used to help these patients with
their terminal virus, or should they be used to help poor women get
proper prenatal care, or allow poor schoolchildren hot lunches?
   Providing AZT to all who need it, regardless of their ability to
pay, is the compassionate thing to do. But is it fiscally
responsible to do so in a nation with a mounting debt and an
exploding health bill?
   What this dilemma does is offer an additional reminder that
massive education, and changes in habits are needed to prevent the
spread of this preventable disease. It also highlights the need for
research to find a cure for AIDS as well as the need for discovery
of affordable means of treatment.

   Picayune (Miss.) Item on Voyager 2:
   Twelve long years and billions of miles after launching, the
plucky Voyager spacecraft rendezvoused with the distant planet
Neptune, sending back a wealth of spectacular pictures and other
information. It was a dramatic climax to a remarkable mission.
   This is technology at its best. Technology often gets a bum rap
these days. People ask why we should spend so much on such
adventures when there are so many problems here on Earth.
   Voyager tells us why. We want to know what's there, over the next
hill. Mankind always has. Maybe what we find will be good or
beneficial, maybe it won't. But we don't know till we look, till we
use our human resources to invent, to dream, to venture beyond our
safe little backyards.
   The desolation of the other planets that Voyager has so
graphically shown us has been a lesson in itself. Our Earth is a
special place, a unique oasis of beauty and knowledge in the
vastness of space.
   We must preserve it, to be sure, but we must also make the most
of what we have _ always thankful for our blessings, always willing
to use them.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on Colombia's drug crackdown:
   It is with a sense of deep satisfaction Americans watch the
courageous move by the imperilled Colombian government as it rounded
up close to 10,000 drug suspects in an all-out search for the five
men who control the Medellin cartel and their associates. ...
   This effort to stop the production and flow of cocaine and crack
in Colombia comes too late for 550 provincial judges, the country's
leading presidential candidate, and countless drug enforcement
officers, senators, farmers, witnesses, bystanders, all killed by
the cartel for getting in the way of the flow of coke from Colombia
to the streets of the United States.
   It comes too late for the thousands killed in this country each
month in crack-related violence.
   But Colombia is finally doing something. It is doing more than
its best consumer, our own country. Without the relentless demand
here, Colombian cocaine would disappear.

   Protesters blocked railroad tracks and
battled police during nationwide demonstrations Wednesday against
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Officials said 11 people were killed
and more than 100,000 arrested.
   The nationwide strike shut down commerce and transportation in
six states controlled by opposition parties but had less effect in
the 19 states governed by Gandhi's Congress Party, Press Trust of
India said.
   Several clashes broke out between government supporters and
opposition demonstrators and at least four people died when a bomb
was thrown at a bus, police said. Police used batons and tear gas to
break up crowds nationwide, news reports said.
   At least 80 people were injured and 103,450 were arrested
nationwide, police said.
   Opposition parties had called the strikes to focus attention on
alleged government corruption. Gandhi must call new parliamentary
elections later this year and the strike has been perceived as being
the start of the opposition's campaign.
   The strike closed shops, businesses and schools and stopped rail
and transport services in the six opposition-government states. In
other regions, it evoked only a limited response although there was
a drop in business activity and attendance at schools, colleges and
offices.
   About 2,700 people, including 16 lawmakers, were arrested for
sitting on railroad tracks to block trains in southern Tamil Nadu
state, police said.
   Press Trust said at least 11 people were killed in clashes
involving police and pro- and anti-government factions. It said
seven deaths were reported from the northeastern state of Tripura,
which borders Bangladesh, in fighting between members of the
Congress Party and the Marxist Communist Party.
   Four people were killed in the states of Kerala and West Bengal,
both governed by the Marxist Communist Party, it said.
   V.P. Singh, the leader of an opposition coalition trying to unite
political groups against Gandhi, said the strike was a success.
   ``We are very confident of the future,'' he said at a news
conference.
   Singh's National Front had called the strike and was supported by
the Marxist Communist Party, the Communist Party of India and the
right-wing Indian People's Party.
   Federal Home Minister Buta Singh claimed the strike failed and
that ``the forces that inspired it have been decisively defeated.''
   He said that except in the opposition-ruled states, citizens
rejected the strike call and federal government organizations
nationwide functioned normally.
   In New Delhi, thousands of government employees slept in their
offices Tuesday night so they could report to work on Wednesday. The
government had threatened not to pay them the day's salary if they
missed work.
   Food and bedrolls were provided for employees and senior
executives were given rooms in luxury hotels, said officials who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The strike brought to a climax the opposition's campaign against
alleged corruption in the government. Last month, 106 opposition
members in Parliament resigned, saying a government audit into a
controversial arms deal proved kickbacks were paid to senior
officials and Gandhi's party.
   Opposition leaders say a Swedish company, AB Bofors, paid $50
million in kickbacks and bribes to secure a $1.4 billion contract to
supply artillery guns to the Indian army. The government denies the
charge.
   Parliamentary elections must be called before January.
   The strike was a rare show of unity for the normally fractured
opposition.
   Gandhi's Congress Party won 415 out of the 544 parliamentary
seats in the last general elections in 1985. Political analysts say
any chance the opposition could have for winning the next election
lies in its ability to put up concensus candidates and avoid
splitting the anti-Congress vote.
   The only time the Congress has lost an election in independent
India was when the opposition united in 1977. But that government
fell apart less than three years later when the fragile coalition
splintered.

<DATELINE>SNOHOMISH, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two small planes collided in flight and
crashed, one bursting into flames, and all four people on board were
killed, authorities said.
   Searchers combed the area today for clues to the cause of the
crash, which occurred about 8 p.m. Tuesday about a mile west of
Harvey Field near the small Puget Sound-area town of Snohomish.
   Elsewhere, a small plane crashed in front of a trailer park in
Moose Lake, Minn., Tuesday night, killing the pilot and a passenger.
No one on the ground was believed injured.
   In the Washington crash, FAA duty officer Gini Bright in Seattle
said the planes were a Beechcraft Bonanza BE-35 ``V-tail'' with
three occupants, and a Cessna 152 carrying only the pilot.
   Errol van Eaton, a Federal Aviation Administration investigator,
said it appeared that the Bonanza had left Paine Field at Everett,
five miles away, earlier in the day and was returning when the
accident took place.
   ``It would appear ... that one was climbing and one was
descending and they failed to observe each other,'' van Eaton said.
   The planes weren't under direction of air traffic controllers,
and the pilots were responsible for watching for other craft, he
said, adding that the weather was clear.
   ``This is the worst possible mix _ a high-wing Cessna cannot see
up and the Bonanza is a low wing and can't see below. We don't know
yet which was on top, but if history is any indicator, it worked
that way.''
   Van Eaton said the Cessna is owned by Snohomish Flying Service at
Harvey, and the Bonanza, kept at Paine, is owned by Richard Kehew of
Edmonds. Officials have not yet determined who was flying the planes.
   The names of the dead were not immediately available, said
Snohomish County sheriff's dispatch superviser Lonnie Davis.
   One of the planes came close to hitting a horse barn, while the
second plane hit the ground several hundred yards away, said
Snohomish County Sheriff's office spokeswoman Jan Jorgensen.
   The Beechcraft burst into flames on impact; the Cessna did not,
she said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was also investigating.
   The Minnesota crash took place about 7:40 p.m. Tuesday on a road
in front of the Don Bean trailer park, said dispatcher Lynn Parnin
of the Carlton County Sheriff's Department.
   The plane's wreckage was up against a vacant trailer used as a
model. The home didn't appear to be damaged.

   An American Airlines jet made an emergency
landing at an airport today after one of its three hydraulic systems
failed, an airline spokesman said.
   Flight 891, carrying 66 passengers and a crew of six from
Oklahoma City to Dallas, returned to Will Rogers World Airport 11
minutes after taking off, said American spokesman Jim Brown.
   He said the loss of any one or two of the hydraulic systems would
not result in the pilot losing control of the airplane, as happened
with a DC-10 that crashed at Sioux City, Iowa, after losing all
three of its hydraulic systems.
   ``I want to emphasize this kind of airplane has a hydraulically
assisted flight control system. But even if all three (hydraulic
systems) went out ... there would be a cable system to pilot the
aircraft,'' Brown said.
   Brown said mechanics would inspect the plane, a McDonnell Douglas
MD80, to determine if it should be taken out of service and the
passengers transferred to other flights.

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on Colombia's drug crackdown:
   Political leaders in the United States often speak of the need
for a war against drugs, but in Colombia they're fighting the real
thing.
   Colombia is under violent siege by powerful narcotics
traffickers, and the killings there are directly traceable to the
failure to control the drug problem here. ...
   The United States is being less effective than it needs to be in
its efforts to help Colombian society withstand the cartel's corrupt
and violent influence. ...
   U.S. economic aid to Colombia has been cut, and military aid
ended last year. Meanwhile, ghetto addicts and yuppie thrill-seekers
finance the private armies of the cartel. ...
   Those who stand up to the drug lords in Colombia are valuable
allies. ... And when such allies are killed, it underscores the
United States' responsibility to do more to curtail the demand for
drugs, which is the assasins' ultimate source of strength.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on Colombia's drug crackdown:
   President Bush has responded belatedly but appropriately to the
bloody battle unfolding in Colombia. But even more U.S. help may be
required, at taxpayer expense.
   Bush said Friday that the United States would send $65 million
worth of helicopters, weapons and other equipment to help Colombia
in its battle against drug barons.
   The situation in Colombia will test the sincerity of Bush and
members of Congress who have been loudly advocating an all-out fight
against illegal drugs.
   The stability of a foreign nation is at stake. Drug lords must
not be allowed to prevail.

   South Bend (Ind.) Tribune on Voyager 2:
   If you yawned it had to be the hour, not the event. Not since our
distant ancestors emerged from the caves has humankind been treated
to such sights.
   The marvelous journey of Voyager 2 to the edge of the solar
system humbled and excited at the same time, as great human
achievements have always done.
   The pictures of Neptune and its mysterious moons may have lacked
the clarity of a telecast game show, but they were vivid testimony
of what man can do in his better moments. What scientists have
dreamed about for decades was delivered to you on your own TV
screen. ...
   Putting it all in perspective will take time. Drama aside, the
information supplied by Voyager 2 is of enormous value in our
understanding of the universe. ...
   The thousands of scientists and technicians involved in the
Voyager expedition deserve a warm salute from those of us who sit
wondering in front of the tube.
   As it sinks in, we can be permitted to wonder about this strange
creature called man. We can reach out to the stars; we can eliminate
a scourge such as polio, but tolerate war and hunger.
   If we can do some great things, why not others?

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on the Federal Reserve's
independence:
   It is billed as an effort to put an end to secrecy in the Federal
Reserve System, but that is window dressing.
   The fact is that a bill introduced by Rep. Lee Hamilton of
Indiana would factor raw politics into the financial equations of
the Fed, creating nothing short of economic pandemonium. ...
   Hamilton and other critics complain that, like the U.S. Supreme
Court, the Fed is autonomous. Guided by a handful of appointed
experts, it moves interest rates up and down as it pleases. It is
accountable to no one. Its deliberations are conducted in secret.
Its decisions may not be appealed.
   All that is true, and let us be grateful. The alternative _ at
least the alternative favored by ... Hamilton _ is to authorize the
congressionally run General Accounting Office to audit the Fed's
monetary transactions, which are now protected from such scrutiny,
and recommend changes.
   It is not difficult to see how this would give Congress, whose
impulses are unfailingly political, leverage over the Fed's
decisions. ...
   Hamilton also wants to make the Treasury Secretary a voting
member of the Fed, thereby enhancing White House influence, too.
   In justification, he argues that the Fed's monetary policy is not
democratic enough. Of course it isn't democratic. It is not supposed
to be democratic. The genius of the Federal Reserve is precisely
that it insulates monetary decisions from politics. ...
   The purpose of the Hamilton bill is as plain as it is alarming.
... Hamilton hopes to undermine the independence of the Federal
Reserve, the economy's chief protection against a free-wheeling,
free-spending, politically driven Congress. The mechanism may not be
perfect, but it works.
   Only at our enormous peril will Congress be permitted to
``adjust'' it.

<HEAD>Police Arrest 200, Including Tutu's Wife</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested more than 200
women, including the wife of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, during a
protest march in central Cape Town as part of a nationwide defiance
campaign.
   Many of the women, blacks and whites, sat on the street and
chanted freedom songs before police led or carried them into vans.
   In Pretoria, eight blacks and two whites were arrested for trying
to desegregate the capital's whites-only buses, another phase of the
defiance campaign. The two whites were women who bought bus tickets
for blacks.
   Twice this week, shots have been fired into the homes of
organizers of the Pretoria campaign.
   Police stopped the throng of placard-carrying women in Cape Town
after they emerged from a church hall to begin a march to the
British Embassy. They intended to ask Britain to protest the South
African government's handling of student unrest in the Cape Town
area and to intercede on behalf of three black activists facing
execution for a 1986 killing.
   In addition to Leah Tutu, those arrested included Mary Burton, a
white who heads the Black Sash civil rights group, and Dorothy
Boesak, wife of the Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent mixed-race
activist who is president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   Many of the marchers sat in a street adjoining a small plaza
until they were led into police vans and driven away. Scores of
onlookers cheered them.
   Police said the women would be charged with participating in an
illegal gathering.
   A white activist involved in the defiance campaign, Willie
Hofmeyer, was admitted to a Cape Town hospital Wednesday with
suspected internal bleeding, his father said. Hofmeyer has been on a
hunger strike since he was detained by police last week during a
protest at a branch of First National Bank, sponsor of an ongoing
tour by an international rugby team which activists say violates the
sports boycott of South Africa.
   The South African Council of Churches, which supports the
defiance campaign, announced plans for an outdoor rally Saturday in
Soweto, the vast black township outside Johannesburg. The church
council's general secretary, the Rev. Frank Chikane, said the rally
was intended as a forum for blacks to express their opposition to
the white-controlled government in a peaceful manner.
   Outdoor rallies are illegal unless authorized by the government,
and Chikane said he hoped Saturday's event would be approved. Tutu
and Boesak are among the scheduled speakers.
   Before dawn Wednesday, a bomb exploded at the home of a member of
the Indian chamber of Parliament, causing damage but no injuries.
Police said the explosion wrecked a door and several windows at the
home of Ahomed Lambat in Alberton, southeast of Johannesburg. There
was no claim of responsibility.
   Anti-apartheid militants are urging a boycott of the Sept. 6
elections for the mixed-race and Indian chambers of Parliament,
which is dominated by a whites-only chamber and excludes the black
majority.

   The Clarksburg (W.Va.) Exponent on the King-Leland legacies:
   The two black Americans achieved their measure of fame by living
radically different lives. One was a clergyman, the other a
politician. Yet both served humanity with an identically relentless
love.
   Today, a national holiday enshrines the transfiguring legacy of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But it is too soon to predict
whether America will carry out the legacy of Rep. Mickey Leland in
the aftermath of his tragic death in Ethiopia.
   We are a nation that thrives on the empty grandeur of symbols. It
is far more convenient to erect a graven image to the prophet than
to adopt his philosophy. After King died, we named streets,
buildings and schools after him. Twenty-one years later, those
schools are more likely to be completely segregated.
   Like King, Leland believed one should live his religious
convictions. Like King, he suffered an untimely death while
searching for peace.
   Unlike many of his colleagues, Leland did not believe in
traveling abroad on junkets camouflaged as ``legislative oversight
missions,'' ... to luxuriate in the world's best hotels and savor
the food at its most elegant restaurants. ...
   Instead of flying to Paris ... Leland flew into Ethiopia's foggy
mountainous terrain to visit dirt-poor refugee camps.
   But we do what Mickey Leland deplored: extolling him with words
instead of exploring legislative ways to carry out his ideals.
   The only monuments Leland would care about would be for this
nation to make a commitment to feeding the hungry, preventing the
erosion of civil rights at home and seeking the sovereign dignity
for all peoples abroad.

   Philadelphia Inquirer on the Legal Services Corp.:
   President Reagan's war against legal services to the poor should
have ended when he left office, but it didn't. Unfortunately, the
people he chose are still running the Legal Services Corp., which
passes federal funds to agencies that represent poor people in
litigation.
   As (President) Bush has dallied in nominating people to fill the
11 seats on the LSC's board of directors, the lame ducks now in
charge have continued to discredit themselves.
   Several months ago, the LSC hired an outside lawyer to produce a
10-page legal memorandum that argued, weakly, that the Legal
Services Corp. itself is unconstitutional. This continued the
tradition of Reagan-era embarrassments, which included lucrative
consulting contracts for some LSC leaders.
   If ... Bush longs to rekindle the extremism of the Reagan era, he
could simply choose some of the 11 potential directors put forward
by Phyllis Schlafly, Howard Phillips and other fringe-dwellers.
   But if he backs the premise of the Legal Services Corp. _ that
every American has the right to effective legal representation ... _
he will fill those seats with outstanding Americans whose own work
has shown their commitment to legal services to the poor.

   The Jackson (Mich.) Citizen Patriot on Indian remains:
   American Indians have a bone to pick with one of the white man's
cultural institutions _ the museum.
   Meeting in Albuquerque (N.M.) recently, the National Congress of
American Indians estimated that the bones of 2.5 million of their
ancestors are held in U.S. museums. Those remains should be
returned, Indians say.
   Museum officials put the figures at much less. They admit to
having the remains of between 100,000 and 250,000 Indians. Indeed,
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., has 18,600 Indian
remains stacked in boxes in a hallway closed to the public.
   We don't want to refight old wars. But here's a thought to
ponder: Numbers of remains aside, if those were the bones of
American slaves, would the museums get away with this? Of course not.
   What, then, makes it OK to unearth the remains of Indian
ancestors and ``bury'' them in display cases and boxes as an
anthropological curiosity? Because ``we'' beat the red man? Because
to the victor go the spoils?
   Sometimes we're not sure the right side won.

   Daily Register, Portage, Wis., on tranquilizing bears:
   The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish encountered harsh
criticism from animal rights advocates and the public in general ...
after an incident in which a bear, tranquilized after climbing a
utility pole, came in contact with live wires and fell to the ground.
   And well it should.
   The agency, whose primary purpose is to maintain guidelines to
ensure the survival of fish and game _ including bear _ did not seem
to consider this when tranquilizing the bear, which had climbed the
pole after wandering into a town in search of its cub.
   After the bear climbed up the pole, the agency's first step
should have been to cut electrical power.
   Next, it should have prepared for the bear's fall _ in the form
of a safety net _ if the bear fell after being shot with the
tranquilizer gun.
   Instead, the state agency did neither. The result was a 25-foot
fall and contact (with) transformer coils _ in the form of 7,200
volts.
   The bear survived _ thankfully.
   A game and fish department official, after getting a host of
calls criticizing the methods, said the agency was ``only concerned
about the safety of residents.'' So much for its mission of ensuring
the survival of fish and game.

<HEAD>Hotel Queen Tarnished: Testimony Destroys Carefully Cultivated Image</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Helmsley Trial, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She entered federal court nine weeks ago as Leona
Helmsley, Hotel Queen, ruler of a multibillion-dollar empire. But
the image of a different woman emerged at the trial _ tyrannical,
nasty, sharp-tongued, cheap.
   It's been quite a change for Mrs. Helmsley, the one-time
Chesterfield cigarette girl who was used to getting her way _ and,
witnesses in her tax evasion trial testified, turning ugly when she
didn't.
   She was convicted Wednesday of evading $1.2 million in income
taxes by charging personal expenses to her business.
   No one figured it would lead to fingerprints when Mrs. Helmsley _
born Leona Mindy Rosenthal, daughter of a Brooklyn hatmaker _
married billionaire Harry Helmsley in 1972 and thrust herself into
the spotlight.
   Once a featured guest on ``60 Minutes,'' Mrs. Helmsley spurned
interviews during her trial. Portrayed as a regal perfectionist in
her ads, she was dumped by her advertising agency this month amid
charges of meddling.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is Harry's second wife; she, too, was married
before, to a lawyer she divorced in 1959. The couple had a son, who
died in 1982; mention of his death brought her near tears at her
trial, the only emotion she's shown in the packed courtroom.
   Her 80-year-old husband, indicted with her, avoided trial on
grounds of mental incompetence.
   Leona was a successful model who had moved into real estate when
she met Helmsley in 1971. She quickly became a $500,000-a-year
senior vice president. Within a year, she became Mrs. Helmsley.
   No one questions the couple's devotion. Leona called Harry
``gorgeous one'' and ``pussycat'' in a People magazine interview;
Harry bathed the Empire State Building _ one of his real estate
holdings _ in red, white and blue light for her birthday in 1976.
   ``It was less than a necklace,'' Helmsley said of the $100,000
treat.
   The couple enjoyed an opulent lifestyle: an $11 million
Connecticut mansion (the focus of the tax charges), a Manhattan
duplex, a Palm Beach penthouse. They travel in their private plane;
their $5 billion real estate empire includes 27 hotels.
   Mrs. Helmsley took control of the Helmsley hotels in 1980. Her
face adorned ads for the hotels; her persona _ the demanding boss
bent on perfection _ became her company's motto.
   ``Service and appointment fit for royalty _ you _ our guest,''
read one Helmsley Palace ad. ``The only palace in the world where
the queen stands guard,'' promised another.
   Mrs. Helmsley's legal woes prior to her indictment last year were
limited to reports about a scam to avoid state sales tax. She was
never charged, although it was reported she received immunity for
her cooperation.
   The real Leona-bashing began with her trial.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch and developer Donald Trump, who rarely agree
on anything, concurred on Leona: the mayor dubbed her ``the wicked
witch,'' while Trump called her ``a sick woman.''
   In opening arguments, her own lawyer labeled her ``a tough
bitch;'' in closing, a prosecutor attacked her ``selfishness, greed
and sheer arrogance.'' Former employees detailed an abrasive boss
who hired and fired on a whim.
   Defense attorney Gerald Feffer argued it was proper for the
Helmsleys to bill their business for expenses at Dunellen Hall
because they used the estate for business. The employees who
testified, he argued, were motivated by spite.
   It was one of those employees, housekeeper Elizabeth Baum, who
provided the most memorable line on Leona:
   ``We don't pay taxes,'' she quoted Mrs. Helmsley as telling her.
``Only the little people pay taxes.''

   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
arrived today on a trip designed to foster closer ties and establish
the diplomatic credentials of his new adminstration.
   During his first overseas trip since taking office Aug. 9, Kaifu
hopes to use baseball diplomacy and meetings with U.S. officials and
academics to ease trade tensions between America and Japan, Foreign
Ministry officials said.
   Kaifu was greeted here this morning by Nobuo Matsunaga, Japanese
ambassador to the United States; Shunji Yanai, Japanese consul
general in San Francisco; and several local officials.
   Kaifu, 58, is not expected to propose any major trade or
diplomatic initiatives in his talks Friday with President Bush.
   But he hopes to ``establish a close and credible working
relationship with the president and other American leaders,'' said
Yukio Okamoto, director of the Foreign Ministry's First North
America Division.
   Kaifu also will use the 12-day tour, which will take him to
Mexico on Sept. 4-6 and to Canada Sept. 7, to enhance his stature at
home, analysts say.
   Kaifu, who has little diplomatic experience but is considered an
excellent speaker, will address scholars and journalists in San
Francisco, Washington and Boston, where he plans to watch a Red Sox
baseball game from the owner's box.
   ``Mr. Kaifu wants to initiate a much more increased level of
intellectual dialogue with the United States, and especially with
its people,'' Okamoto said.
   In their meeting, Kaifu and Bush are expected to talk about
so-called structural problems that impede an improvement in the U.S.
trade deficit with Japan, which totaled $55 billion in 1988,
according to U.S. figures.
   Kaifu is expected to explain Japan's efforts to reduce the trade
imbalance, and express its willingness to focus on issues like its
complex distribution system and business practices that Americans
say block foreign access to the Japanese market.
   But the prime minister also will emphasize the need for the
United States to address problems such as its large budget deficit
and low investment rate, Foreign Ministry officials say.
   U.S.-Japanese talks on such non-tariff trade barriers are
scheduled to begin Sept. 4, but Kaifu's Liberal Democratic Party is
under strong pressure at home not to make additional concessions on
trade.
   Recent election losses suffered by the party were attributed in
part to the unhappiness of farmers over Japanese concessions on
agricultural trade.
   ``It will take a long time to solve the trade imbalance and in
the meantime we have to live with it,'' a ministry official said.
``To defuse the tension caused by the imbalance, we need a more
objective understanding of each other.''
   Kaifu also will reassure Bush and other U.S. officials of Japan's
political and diplomatic stability, ministry officials said.
   Some Japanese foreign policy initiatives have been stalled in
recent months as the Liberal Democrats grappled with a series of
money and sex scandals and an election setback that led to the
resignation of Kaifu's two predecessors.

   Two white teen-agers were indicted today on
murder charges in the killing of a black youth last week that has
set off a racial furor in the city.
   The indictments were returned in Brooklyn Criminal Court just one
hour before the funeral of Yusef Hawkins, 16. A crowd of about 300
people heckled Gov. Mario Cuomo and New York City Mayor Edward I.
Koch as they arrived for the service. Koch had been jeered when he
attended a wake for Hawkins Tuesday.
   Keith Mondello, 18, and Pasquale Raucci, 19, of Brooklyn, were
charged with murder, riot, assault, criminal possession of a deadly
weapon, unlawful imprisonment and civil rights violations.
   Mondello was the alleged leader of a gang of up to 30 whites,
armed with baseball bats and golf clubs, that allegedly attacked
Hawkins and three friends Aug. 23 in the predominantly white
Bensonhurst neighborhood.
   ``We're surrounded by Martin and Malcolm. We're surrounded by
Eleanor Bumpurs. We're surrounded by Michael Griffith,'' said the
Rev. Timothy Mitchell, a Brooklyn civil rights activist, to start
the service at Glover Memorial Baptist Church in Brooklyn. ``They
all speak to us and say, `No more.'''
   Martin and Malcolm are Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. Michael
Griffith is the black man who was killed when a gang of whites
chased him onto a highway in Howard Beach; Eleanor Bumpurs was a
black woman killed when police tried to evict her from her apartment.
   Among those at the crowded memorial service were the Rev. Louis
Farrakhan and Cedric Sandiford, who had also been attacked in the
1986 Howard Beach incident. He accompanied Michael Griffith's
mother, Jean.
   ``Go home!'' the crowd chanted at Cuomo, while the mayor and
Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward were booed. Mayoral candidates
Harrison J. Goldin and David Dinkins were also at the funeral.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson was among 1,600 people who attended a wake
Tuesday for Hawkins.
   ``This is nothing more than a political indictment,'' charged
Mondello's lawyer, Stephen Murphy, after his client was charged.
``They know he wasn't the shooter. How can they obtain a murder
indictment? It's absurd.''
   Police are looking for Joseph Fama, 18, of Brooklyn, who has been
identified as the gunman in the killing.
   Judge Seymour Gerschwer allowed Mondello to remain free on
$100,000 bail and Raucci on $75,000 bail. The grand jury that
indicted the two was still considering charges against the other
suspects in the case.
   The night of the attack, Hawkins and three black friends went to
the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst to look at a used car for
sale. A group of 10 to 30 whites, armed with at least one gun, bats
and golf clubs, chased the four and surrounded them.
   Hawkins was shot twice in the chest.
   Six young white men have been charged with assault, riot and
other counts. Five have been released on bail.
   One of the six, Joseph Serrano, 20, was arraigned Tuesday and
held on $75,000 bail. Assistant District Attorney David Neier told
the judge that witnesses had placed Serrano at the scene with a bat
and a pistol.
   There have been reports that Fama may have fled to Italy, where
his parents were born. Police have asked the State Department to
help find him, Sgt. Pete Berry said.
   The FBI has begun a preliminary inquiry into Hawkins' death, said
Ann Driscoll, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney. The
U.S. Attorney's office also has offered assistance to the office of
Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman, which is handling the
case.
   Such steps are not unusual in cases that may involve federal
civil rights violations, Driscoll said.
   Police said Hawkins and his friends were innocent victims of a
feud between the white gang and 18-year-old Gina Feliciano. She had
been dating a Hispanic man and invited black friends into the mostly
white neighborhood.
   One of those arrested was a former boyfriend who had been spurned
by Ms. Feliciano, police said.
   Political, religious and community leaders continued to call for
greater efforts to root out racism.
   Cuomo, in a statement, called on New Yorkers to pray ``that we
will make this moment of shame a time for honesty and renewal.''
   Roman Catholic Cardinal John J. O'Connor said, ``We like to
pretend that racial relations aren't broken. Well, they are broken.
They're bleeding.''
   O'Connor, Brooklyn Bishop Francis J. Mugavero and state Human
Rights Commissioner Douglas H. White joined leaders from the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the
Coalition of Italo-American Associations in warning against
condemning the entire Bensonhurst community.
   ``These people are good, the majority,'' said Mugavero, who
described the Italian-Jewish neighborhood as ``a community that
really has very deep basic values.''
   But Hazel N. Dukes, president of the state conference of NAACP
branches, said, ``When good people do nothing, evil people take
over.''

<HEAD>Doctors Drop Surgery Because East German Leader Too Ill, Sources
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German leader Erich Honecker
underwent gall bladder surgery but doctors had to halt the operation
because of the condition of the organ had deteriorated, West German
security sources said Wednesday.
   East Germany denied the reports about Honecker, 77. A Foreign
Ministry spokesman in East Berlin, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he was ``progressing toward recovery.''
   Honecker was reported to have undergone a gall bladder operation
two weeks ago. The East German government said on Aug. 24 he was
``continuing on the road to recovery.''
   But the Hessicher Rundfunk radio on Wednesday said the West
German government has received intelligence information indicating
Honecker's condition is more serious than official East German
reports suggest.
   Government security sources confirmed the radio report, but would
provide few details.
   According to the sources, Honecker's surgeons were forced to
abandon the gall bladder operation ``because of the condition of the
tissue.''
   The information was relayed to the West German government by the
country's intelligence service, the sources said. There were no
further details.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also speculated
whether Honecker's illness may be one reason the East German
government has not yet taken decisive steps to deal with an exodus
of refugees out of the Communist country.
   At least 6,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany through
Hungary since Hungary began dismantling its border barriers in May.
Scores more are holed up in West German missions and embassies in
East Berlin and Prague, demanding they be allowed to emigrate.
   The situation has created tensions between the two Germanies, as
well as between Hungary and East Germany.
   Hungary is among East bloc nations experimenting with liberal
reforms while East Germany remains a hard-line Communist state.
   Hans Klein, spokesman for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
said there has been ``zero movement'' by the East German government
on the refugee problem.
   ``But I do not know if this has any connection with Mr.
Honecker's condition,'' Klein said.
   Klein also said Kohl's offer still stands to talk with Honecker
about the refugee problem.
   ``But there is a question about whether Mr. Honecker would be
able to do that,'' Klein said.
   Other high-ranking East German officials also are ailing, say
sources in East Berlin.
   Premier Willi Stoph has a stomach ailment and has not appeared in
public for some time and Guenter Mittag, who is responsible for
economic affairs, has been suffering from acute leg pains, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Stoph is 75 and Mittag is 62.
   Honecker has not been seen in public since his operation.
   Werner Kohlhoff, spokesman for the West Berlin government, said
Mayor Walter Momper had hoped to meet with Honecker at the Leipzig
trade fair on Sunday but that city officials have learned the East
German leader will not be there.
   Sources in East Berlin said Mittag also would not be at the fair.
   East Germany's leadership attaches enormous prestige to the
Leipzig trade fair and Honecker traditionally opens the biannual
international event.
   Honecker has been hospitalized twice this summer.
   Illness forced him to leave a Warsaw Pact summit in Bucharest on
July 8 before its conclusion, and the official East German media
later announced he was in a hospital for problems related to
gallstones.
   He has ruled the country of 16.6 million people since 1971. He
supervised the building of the Berlin Wall 10 years earlier.
   Honecker has strongly shunned the adoption of Kremlin-style
political reforms, a factor in the recent surge of refugees from
East Germany to the West.

<TEXT>
   On the theory that no one knows scandal like
someone who has been caught in one, organizers have signed up
participants in some historic instances of Washington waywardness to
address an ethics seminar.
   Figures of scandals past and present _ from the delinquency of
Watergate to the unseemliness at HUD _ will address about 200 career
government officials who will pay fees of $345 to $445 to attend the
sessions on ``Scandals, Scoundrels &amp; Saints.''
   The Nov. 1 and 2 event is the fifth annual running of the Senior
Executives Association's annual course on the straight and narrow.
The association represents 2,500 career government executives and
managers.
   Among those taking part is Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman
of a subcommittee handling ethics issues. He agreed to appear before
getting caught up last week in an uproar over his own behavior.
   Frank, an acknowledged homosexual, asked the House ethics
committee on Monday to investigate his relationship with a male
prostitute whom he had hired to do household chores, then fired
after suspecting that the man was selling sex from Frank's apartment
on Capitol Hill. House rules require members to act ``at all times
in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House.''
   From another scandal front comes Charles L. Dempsey, retired
inspector general of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, who says he couldn't arrest congressional interest in
his reports of questionable behavior at HUD during the Reagan
administration. His topic: ``The Flesh Is Willing....''
   ``But the Spirit Is Weak'' is Elsa Porter's topic. A former
assistant secretary of commerce, she's director of the Project on
Development of Moral Character at Work.
   Jeb Staurt Magruder, a former aide to President Nixon who became
a minister in Columbus, Ohio, after getting caught up in the
Watergate affair, will discuss ``Life After a Scandal.''
   That's Robert Bauman's topic, too. He was a Republican
congressman from Maryland who was defeated after disclosures about
his life as a homosexual.
   No one from the Bush administration has agreed yet to speak, said
association spokesman Gini Blodgett, but President Bush's ethics
czar, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, has been invited. Gray got
caught in an ethics wringer himself in February and had to resign as
chairman of a multimillion dollar broadcasting company to avoid an
appearance of a conflict of interest.
   For an evening's entertainment, seminar participants will be able
to take a two-hour bus ``Scandals Tour of Washington,'' which
carries intrigued tourists to such places as the Watergate; the
Tidal Basin, where an inebriated Wilbur Mills saw his congressional
career sink when his lady friend, stripper Fanne Foxe, took a
plunge; and the Capitol Hill townhouse where Gary Hart entertained
model Donna Rice and doomed his 1988 Democratic presidential hopes.

<UNK>Counterfeiter Who Forged Hospital Pass Recaptured at Campsite</UNK>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A twice-convicted counterfeiter who forged a
hospital pass and walked away from a court-ordered residence program
was back in custody Wednesday, authorities said.
   William G. ``Pop'' Kerns, 67, who has spent about 30 of the past
50 years in jail, was arrested on a tip Tuesday at an Indiana
campsite.
   After his arrest July 19 on counterfeiting charges, Kerns was
placed in a pre-trial custody program at the Volunteers of America.
Despite Kerns' age and poor health, a federal magistrate rejected
prosecutors' requests to put him in jail.
   Officials were more confident of keeping Kerns behind bars this
time. He was being held in the Marion County Jail for a hearing
later Wednesday.
   ``I would suspect the court would be highly receptive,'' said
Chief Gary Tingle of the U.S. Marshals Service. ``They're not real
pleased when people take advantage of them and their generosity.''
   Kerns, with at least 45 arrests since 1939, had been arrested in
July after Secret Service agents caught him making counterfeit $100
bills on a printing press, officials said.
   He walked away from the custody program Aug. 22 after forging a
counselor's signature on a pass to Wishard Hospital, authorities
said.

   Reports of ties between
Israelis and Colombian drug lords are overblown and only one or two
companies may have violated the law, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
said Wednesday.
   Rabin, on a visit to the West Bank, also said there were few if
any Israeli mercenaries.
   He and other officials sought to stem the scandal about
allegations that former army officers gave paramilitary training to
assassination squads for the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia.
   Israeli media said the issue also had divided government
officials and could affect lucrative arms exports to Colombia.
   Police questioned two more employee of Hod Hahanit, or Spearhead,
a security and arms trading company said to have provided training
for the cartel.
   Yair Klein, a reserve lieutenant colonel who heads the company,
confirmed Wednesday an Israeli official told him to leave Colombia
because he might be arrested _ raising the possibility the
government knew more of his dealings than it has acknowledged.
   Parliament's law committee rejected a proposal that laws
controlling the export of arms and military expertise be
strengthened to allow prosecution of Israelis for offenses committed
abroad.
   Some lawmakers said even discussing the matter could influence
the current police investigation. Legislator Amnon Rubinstein of the
left-leaning Shinui party said the government was moving too slowly.
   ``What bothers me is that, for a very long time, these things
have been known,'' he said. ``In my opinion, there is no room for
Israelis to be military advisers to unsavory types.''
   Rabin told journalists: ``I believe the media, especially in
Israel, are making unjustified statements based on rumors rather
than on solid information.''
   He said the government was investigating and would punish any
former officers who broke Israeli law. ``We are not trying to hide,
to conceal,'' the defense minister said.
   Israel's controls on exports of military equipment and knowledge
are the most stringent in the world and companies must have Defense
Ministry permits for overseas deals, Rabin said.
   ``I believe basically the number of people who have not obeyed
the law ... is very, very limited,'' he said. ``One or two Israeli
companies either worked without permission or went beyond the
permission. Allow me also to stress the point that Israeli
mercenaries are basically non-existent.''
   News reports from Colombia said five Israelis were among
foreigners involved in training killers for the drug cartels.
   A report in Haaretz, an Israeli papter, said defense officials
ignored advice by the Foreign Ministry two years ago not to issue
permits for deals with private groups in Colombia because the
country was unstable.
   Al Hamishmar, another daily, said Rabin was angered by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's expression of doubt, after Rabin ordered
an investigation, that any Israeli officers had behaved improperly.
   Israel radio said the allegations were raising questions in
Colombia about whether to order more Kfir jet fighters from Israel.
   Arms exports usually are secret in Israel, but the daily Yediot
Ahronot said Tuesday that Colombia had bought more than $350 million
worth of aircraft, guns and other military hardware from this
country in the past several years.

   The State Department on Wednesday condemned
Syria's shelling of a tanker carrying badly needed fuel supplies to
the besieged capital of Lebanon.
   ``The United States deeply deplores the Syrian attack on the fuel
transport ship, Sunshield, off the coast of Lebanon, with apparent
loss of life among the crew,'' said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``This incident points out the immediate need for all sides to
accept the cease-fire, lift the blockades, and allow a process of
political dialogue to begin under Arab League auspices,'' she said.
   The Maltese-flagged tanker was hit and set on fire Tuesday as it
tried to run the Syrian blockade along Beirut's Christian enclave.
Seven crewmen were killed and two were wounded. Police said two were
missing and believed dead.
   Nearly six months of fighting between Syria and its Moslem allies
and Lebanon's Christian forces have left at least 803 killed and
2,287 wounded.

   Oscar-winning director Billy Wilder is selling
part of his large art collection, including a Picasso estimated to
be worth $7 million.
   ``I wanted the fun of having empty walls for once,'' the
83-year-old Wilder joked in a telephone interview from Beverly
Hills, Calif., with The New York Times.
   Wilder, who has won six Oscars for writing or directing such
films as ``Sunset Boulevard'' and ``Some Like it Hot,'' said he
wanted to be able to have the fun of watching the action at the
November sale at Christie's in New York.
   ``Can you imagine Andy Warhol being around when those idiots were
fighting over his cookie jars at $10,000 a shot?'' he said.
   ``Having worked evey day of my life and not owned horses or
yachts or junk bonds, I put everything into art to decorate my
walls,'' he said. ``I wish I'd collected more and directed less.
It's been more fun collecting than making movies.''
   His collection, estimated to be worth between $20 million and $30
million, includes works by such artists as Renoir, Braque, Paul Klee
and Joan Miro.

   A bandaged hand didn't stop The Who
guitarist Pete Townshend from taking his trademark ``windmill''
swipes at his guitar.
   Townshend, taking part in the band's 25th anniversary tour,
showed up on stage Tuesday night at the Oakland Coliseum with a
cloth bandage on his right hand and wowed the crowd by swinging his
arm in circles and strumming heavily.
   Townshend injured his hand Aug. 17 on stage in Tacoma, Wash.,
when he impaled it on his guitar's whammy bar, which allows the
musician to vary the instrument's pitch. No nerves or tendons were
injured and he was treated at a hospital.
   Because his hearing has been damaged by loud music after years of
touring, Townshend has been playing mostly acoustic guitars on his
current tour.

   Former heavyweight champ Joe Frazier was
released from a hospital Wednesday, six days after going in for
observation following a minor traffic accident, his manager said.
   ``They checked him for broken bones, internal injuries and gave
him an overall physical,'' said manager Burt Watson.
   While Frazier, 45, was found to be in good shape, his doctors
told him to take it easy for the next couple of weeks, Watson said.
   ``He needs to strengthen himself from being in there,'' said
Watson. ``He needs to build his resistance back.''
   Watson said Frazier was driving to his gym Aug. 20 when his
limousine was bumped from behind by a van.
   He didn't feel any discomfort until a few days later, when he
complained of aches in his legs and stiffness in his back, Watson
said. He entered Methodist Hospital on Aug. 24.

   Here is the English text of the statement issued
Wednesday by the Paris International Conference on Cambodia:
   At the invitation of the government of France and under the
co-chairmanship of His Excellency Ali Alatas, foreign minister of
Indonesia, the International Conference on Cambodia met in Paris
from July 30 to Aug. 30, 1989. Participating in the conference were
the representatives of Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia,
Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Lao People's
Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America, Vietnam
and Zimbabwe in its capacity as current chairman of the Non-Aligned
Movement. Cambodia was represented by the four Cambodian parties.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations and his representatives
also participated in the conference.
   The conference, mindful of the previous efforts made at the
Jakarta Informal Meetings and elsewhere, achieved progress in
elaborating a wide variety of elements necessary for the reaching of
a comprehensive settlement to the tragic conflict in Cambodia. The
conference noted, however, that it is not yet possible to achieve a
comprehensive settlement. It was therefore decided to suspend the
conference.
   The conference urges all parties concerned to intensify their
efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement. To facilitate these
efforts, the co-presidents of the conference shall lend their good
offices as required to participating parties and countries who can
facilitate a comprehensive settlement, including the reconvening of
the Committees as appropriate.
   The co-presidents will begin consultations within six months with
the participants in the conference with a view to reconvening the
conference.
   The French government expressed its readiness to make the
appropriate arrangements to reconvene the conference in due time in
Paris.
   The Indonesian co-president and all the participatns expressed
their sincere appreciation and deep gratitude to the government and
people of France for hosting this important conference and the
excellent arrangements made as well as for their generous
hospitality extended to all delegations.

<HEAD>Leader Calls for Higher Living Standard at No Spiritual Cost</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's new
spiritual leader, urged the government Wednesday to raise living
standards without sacrificing emphasis on spiritual goals, Tehran
radio reported.
   It quoted Khamenei as telling President Hashemi Rafsanjani and
his new Cabinet:``People mustn't think that. ... untangling the
practical problems in the nation's life ... means moving away from
the revolution's spirituality and its Islamic goals.''
   Khamenei said Islam's ``enemies'' want Iranians to believe that,
if those who govern ``want to solve the problems of the people .. .
increase production in the country ... then probably this means
forgetting, weakening or discoloring the goals of the revolution and
the spiritual.''
   On Tuesday, the parliament approved all 22 ministers chosen by
Rafsanjani, despite speculation that some technocrats would be
rejected by those who wanted a more radical government.
   Rafsanjani seeks to revive the economy and attract foreign
capital to rebuild after the eight-year war with Iraq.
   Approval of the entire Cabinet showed the parliament
``understands well the realities of the country, understands the
issues and knows itself to be responsible in context of these
realities and this nation,'' said Khamenei, who was chosen as
spiritual leader after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini died June 3.
   Missing from Rafsanjani's government are such hard-liners as
former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who is thought to
have links with groups holding foreign hostages in Lebanon, and
Mohammad Reyshahri, the former intelligence minister and a strong
opponent of restorig ties with the West.
   The main opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq based in Iraq,
said Rafsanjani will have to continue purging radical elements to
keep his program on track.
   Iranian newspapers repeated Khamenei's call for economic
development.
   ``Today is the beginning of a nationwide effort to construct and
rebuild the country in a manner suitable for an Islamic society,''
said an editorial in the radical, Farsi-language Abrar daily carried
by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   During the three-day Cabinet debate, Rafsanjani rebuffed claims
that his ministers lacked political experience. He said they ``have
the necessary political credentials, but this time the emphasis has
been to ensure that they are also functional.''
   ``Right now we have to put more effort into ensuring that the
programs passed by parliament are implemented,'' he said.

<HEAD>European Swine Disease Shows Up in Iowa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An infectious swine disease previously found
only in Europe has been confirmed in stillborn and weak baby pigs in
the United States, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The disease is a type of leptospirosis, which is caused by
corkscrew-shaped bacteria called leptospires. About 180 types of
leptospires cause disease in livestock, said Carole A. Bolin,
veterinary medical officer with USDA's Agricultural Research Service
in Ames, Iowa.
   Bolin said in a report released in Washington that the disease,
caused by an organism called bratislava, was found in an Iowa herd.
The name resulted after the bacterium was first isolated in 1953
from a hedgehog in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.
   Leptospirosis is transmitted primarily by infected urine, but the
leptospires also can pass through the pregnant female's placenta to
the fetus. Another probable cause of infection is thought to be
venereal transmission from infected boars.
   Humans in contact with infected animals or urine can develop
leptospirosis, the report said.
   Bratislava is being studied as a possible contributor to a
``mystery'' syndrome that began causing stillbirths, abortions and
deaths of nursing baby pigs about a year ago in the Midwest.
   The study was undertaken five months ago at the agency's animal
disease center in Ames under a ``technology transfer'' agreement
with Norden Laboratories of Lincoln, Neb.
   Bolin said the next step is to inoculate pregnant sows with
bratislava to ``establish absolute proof'' that the U.S. version
causes reproductive disease. Also, laboratory tests need to be
conducted to determine the effectiveness of vaccines in pregnant
sows.
   Norden is marketing two vaccines under conditional USDA licenses
and is applying for permanent licencing, she said.
   A company scientist, Joseph C. Frantz, said vaccination with the
conditionally licensed vaccine protects the animal against
``clinical signs caused by bratislava'' through one pregnancy. He
recommended vaccination prior to each breeding.
   Leptospirosis in both animals and humans can be mild or severe,
and is often misdiagnosed, the agency said. The disease in humans
has been confused with influenza, hepatitis, yellow fever,
pneumonia, polio, meningitis and encephalitis.

<HEAD>Cholera Breaks Out in Squalid Refugee Camp</HEAD>

   Cholera has broken out at a camp housing 4,500
Vietnamese refugees who suffer from poor sanitary conditions and
lack of water, a health official said Wednesday.
   The first case of the disease was discovered Sunday, the same day
food riots hit the camp.
   Dr. Lo Wai-kee, principal medical officer of the Vietnamese Boat
People Health Service, said the government agency had confirmed that
a 4-year-old Vietnamese boy and two women had contracted the
gastrointestinal disease.
   He said all three, who are from different families, are in
satisfactory condition.
   Lo said he was not surprised at the cholera outbreak at Tai A
Chau, an outlying island, because of the poor health conditions
there.
   ``The environment is not satisfactory. The potential risks are
there,'' he said.
   He said there was insufficent water for washing, and the
Vietnamese had to bathe in the sea. Garbage collection is poor, and
there are no indoor bathrooms, he said.
   Lo said at least one of the victims had eaten improperly cooked
seafood and may have caught the disease as a result.
   He said it was unlikely the disease was transmitted through
government dry rations.
   U.N. refugee officials have said Vietnamese refugees in Hong
Kong's screening centers were in danger of dying because of
malnutrition and disease.
   Lo said there was no such danger on Tai A Chau, but he
acknowledged that common disease on the island include pink-eye,
skin illness and enterogastritis.
   A medical team went to the island Wednesday and distributed drugs
to the Vietnamese as a preventive measure, and the government has
imposed a quarantine on the camp, he said.
   Lo said the restriction could be lifted in 10 days if no new
cases were reported.
   Sunday's rioting broke out during rice distribution when about
1,000 Vietnamese started throwing stones at police.
   Authorities fired tear gas to disperse the stone-throwers but
withdrew that night for fear of further violence.
   Police reoccupied Tai A Chau on Monday with helicopters and
landing vessels. They found the police station, health center and
public facilities destroyed and received several rape and robbery
reports.
   By then, about 1,000 boat people had swum to a barge off the
island to escape further attack. They were later moved to Shek Kwu
Chau, another nearby island.
   The government has also placed a quarantine on that island
because of the cholera outbreak on Tai A Chau.
   On Tuesday, 13 Vietnamese were arrested on charges of rape,
robbery and assault during the Sunday rioting.
   About 55,000 Vietnamese are staying in Hong Kong, waiting for
repatriation or resettlement.
   The government began to put newly arriving boat people on Tai A
Chau in June in an emergency measure to cope with their increasing
numbers. Refugees usually stay there for about two weeks before they
are inoculated and moved to other detention centers.
   The three cholera victims had been on the island for a month.

   Acting President F.W. de Klerk on
Wednesday held his third meeting in six days with a black African
leader, conferring with the chairman of Lesotho's military council
about disputes over a joint water project.
   After de Klerk's meeting with Maj. Gen. Justin Lekhanya, South
African Foriegn Minister Pik Botha said the leaders had resolved
differences in the two countries' interpretation of the treaty
governing the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. South Africa, which
surrounds Lesotho, is to purchase water produced by the project.
   De Klerk traveled Friday to a summit with President Mobutu Sese
Seko of Zaire and flew to Zambia on Monday for talks with President
Kenneth Kaunda, a staunch critic of South Africa's white-run
government.
   In Lesotho's capital of Maseru, a magistrate reconvened an
official inquiry Wednesday investigating Lekhanya's alleged
involvement in the shooting death of a college student.
   The inquiry, which had been in recess for several weeks, conerns
the death of George Ramone, 20, who was shot Dec. 23 at Lesotho
Agricultural College.
   No one has been charged, but newspapers in Britain and the United
States have reported Lekhanya admitted to the military council that
he shot the student.
   The reports said Lekhanya's bodyguard originally told police he
shot Ramone. Later, Lekhanya reportedly told the council he was
patrolling the campus and fired to stop an attempted rape.
   Lekhanya led a military coup in January 1986 that overthrew
left-leaning dictator Leabua Jonathan, whose support of the African
Nationalist Congress guerrilla organization had led to a South
African blockade of the small mountain kingdom.
   Lekhayna said in Pretoria the military council, which generally
enjoys good relations with South Africa, was working on a timetable
for restoring some sort of public participation in government. All
political parties currently are banned.

   President Bush welcomed Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Wednesday to ``show off this
heaven'' by the sea and discuss the environment, trade and the drug
crisis in Colombia.
   The visit was billed as a private time for two longtime friends,
but National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft told reporters the two
leaders would no doubt exchange views on the changes in Poland, the
Colombian drug war, the violence in Lebanon and other issues.
   Mulroney was bringing his wife, Mila, and four children for the
two-day stay at Bush's vacation home on Walker's point. ``I can't
wait to show off this heaven to the prime minister of Canada and his
wife and his four kids,'' Bush told a gathering of the Chamber of
Commerce of Kennebunkport and neighboring Kennebunk.
   Bush, who has been on vacation in the coastal resort since Aug.
16, spoke of his love for the town where he has spent all but one
summer of his life.
   ``You can converse, you could relax, you could really get to know
one another in a wonderful setting,'' he said, discussing visits by
French President Mitterrand and Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter.
   Bush, named Citizen of the Year by the local chamber, made the
comments on an outdoor stage by the sea before an audience of about
200 local residents. The stage was flanked by a huge American flag
of red, white and blue balloons.
   The president was presented with a painting of Walker's Point as
it appeared in 1906.
   The day also included an afternoon jog before Mulroney's
arrival.Bush and Mulroney share ``a close similarity of views ...on
world affairs and a kind of unique personal closeness and frankness
in exchanging views,'' Scowcroft told reporters.
   He said U.S.-Canada relations are ``in basically pretty good
shape,'' after the sweeping Free Trade Agreement signed last year by
President Reagan and Mulroney, and efforts by Bush to deal with acid
rain pollution through his proposed Clean Air Act.
   The Clean Air Act would sharply curb emissions from utility
plants and other industrial souces of airborne acid rain that causes
pollution in Canada.
   Scowcroft said the two also would discuss assassinations by drug
barons in Colombia and attempts by President Virgilio Barco Vargas
to crack down on traffickers.
   In his remarks at the Chamber presentation, Bush was applauded
when he asked the local businessmen to support his push for a cut in
the capital gains tax for businesses when he returns to Washington.
   That, he said, ``stimulates the economy. It encourages
risk-taking.''
   Bush made light of press reports noting that he has yet to catch
any fish despite daily fishing excursions on his speedboat,
Fidelity, and called the reports ``a vicious assault on my ability.''
   He also denied reports that he had run over a lobster pot or a
rock with his boat. A Coast Guard inspector took a look at the site
and ``started to tell me that he thought maybe accidently I had hit
a rock.''
   The president, noting he has piloted boats there his entire life,
told the man: ``Find some other answer. Even if there is metal on
the rock out there, I did not hit that rock.''
   The Coast Guard man, hearing the words of his commander in chief,
``changed his mind as I was talking to him and _ we now think it was
a submerged board,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>In Act of Peace, Bells Dedicated in Gdansk Church</HEAD>

   The bells of the St. Catherine's Church
carillon in this port city pealed Wednesday for the first time since
the end of World War II, a symbol of peace and reconciliation 50
years after the conflict began.
   The bells, a gift from the West German people to the residents of
Gdansk, were dedicated at a Mass celebrated by Bishop Tadeusz
Goclowski. Joining in readings during the service, for the intention
of the war's victims, was a German Evangelical minister.
   Afterward, Goclowski consecrated the bells with holy water and
the 1,000-member crowd of Poles and Germans listened to a
computer-directed carillon concert of works of Beethoven and Mozart.
The first melody played by the rededicated carillon was part of
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
   Friday is the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II.
The first shots were fired in Gdansk on the morning of Sept. 1, 1939.
   Thirty-seven bells weighing more than 16 tons make up the
carillon, which replaces a set of bells that was lost during the
war, when the former Free City of Danzig was incorporated into the
Third Reich.
   At the end of the war, the city was largely destroyed, subjected
to Allied bombing raids, Soviet artillery and house-to-house
fighting during the Red Army's advance on the city in March 1945.
   The German population fled or was expelled after the war and
Danzig became the Polish city of Gdansk, causing anger among some
Germans toward Poles.
   But the theme of the rededication ceremony stressed
reconciliation between the nations.
   A former Gdansk resident, Hans Eggegrecht, headed the drive to
replace the bells after noticing the destroyed bell tower during a
trip to his native city five years ago.
   He organized a society in his new home of Bremen and even
traveled to the Vatican to obtain Pope John Paul II's spiritual
blessing for the project.
   The fund accumulated about $150,000 for the project, with
contributors including West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and West
German President Richard von Weizsaecker.
   The new bells were cast at the Dutch Royal Enterprise in Asten
and shipped to Gdansk. One of the bells was inscribed ``Peace and
Reconciliation.''
   St. Catherine's, located between the Old Town of Gdansk and the
Lenin Shipyard, birthplace of the Solidarity independent trade
union, has been the site of a St. Catherine's Church since the year
1261.
   The present church dates from the 15th century and was
reconstructed in 1978.

<HEAD>U.S. Congressman Says Washington Might Reduce Philippine Commitment</HEAD>

   A U.S. congressman said Wednesday that
objections of Filipino senators to U.S. bases here could prompt
Washington to reduce its military commitment to the Philippines.
   He spoke the same day that activists mounted two small protests
at the U.S. Embassy about the bases.
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., was referring to a resolution signed
Thursday by 12 of 23 Filipino senators who called for closing the
bases when their lease expires in 1991.
   U.S. and Philippine officials are expected to begin talks this
year on extending the lease.
   But any agreement must be approved by two-thirds of the
Philippine Senate. The Senate resolution suggests President Corazon
Aquino would lack votes for ratification.
   ``Obviously, it can't be ratified if they stick to what they
say,'' said Murtha. ``I have no idea whether they mean what they
say. But I know it doesn't help the political situation and climate
in the United States when we see distinguished members of their
Congress making statements about the treaty.''
   About 40,000 U.S. troops, civilian employees and military
dependents are stationed at six U.S. installations, which include
Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay Naval Base. They are among the
largest outside the United States.
   Earlier Wednesday, Murtha, who serves as chairman of the House
defense appropriations subcommittee, told an American business group
that maintaining current force levels in the Philippines ``is not a
top priority of the American Congress.''
   He said statements against the bases ``could inflame members of
Congress'' eager to find ways of reducing American troop strength
overseas.
   However, at a later news conference, Murtha said he believes the
bases are vital to the defense of the Far East and contribute
economically to the Philippines. About 70,000 Filipinos work at the
installations, collecting more than $96 million in annual salaries.
   Filipino critics claim the bases infringe on national sovereignty.
   During the protests Wednesday, about 100 leftist students
unfurled anti-bases banners at the Department of Foreign Affairs.
   A group of militant feminists mounted a separate protest against
the bases in front of the U.S. Embassy.
   No violence was reported in either protest.
   In October, the United States agreed to provide $481 million a
year to keep the bases until 1991, but many Filipino politicians
believe Washington should pay more.
   No date has been set for talks on a new agreement. U.S. officials
say Vice President Dan Quayle is expected to discuss the timetable
when he visits the Philippines next month.
   Murtha was part of a congressional delegation that included Reps.
Robert Livingston, R-La., and Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn.

   A passenger train that switched to the
wrong track collided head-on with another train Wednesday, killing
one person and injuring at least 27 others, a railway official said.
   Three cars derailed when the two trains crashed while traveling
at a low rate of speed between Voralberg province's capital of
Bregenz and the small town of Wolfurt, the railway official said.
   Killed was Alfred Rainer Heller, 48, of West Germany. Rescuers
found his body in the wreckage about two hours after the crash.
   Sixteen people, including both train drivers, were hospitalized,
and 11 other people were treated for minor injuries, the rail
official said.
   The injured included Austrian, West German and Swiss passengers,
as well as two Japanese, the official said.
   He said human error was probably to blame for the accident
because one of the trains, an express traveling from Bregenz to
Vienna, was switched onto the same track as the other train.
   There were 72 passengers on the Bregenz-Vienna train and 75 on
the other train, an express from Munich and Zurich, the spokesman
said.
   The crash occurred very close to the site of a train accident a
year earlier in which five people were killed and 46 injured.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Peter Scott, a conservationist who pioneered
the effort to save the world's rain forests and helped launch the
World Wildlife Fund, is dead at age 79.
   Scott, a World War II naval hero and an Olympic yachtsman, died
Tuesday in Bristol's Southmead Hospital following a heart attack
earlier in the day while visiting the western England city. He would
have been 80 on Sept. 14.
   He was known internationally for his campaigns to save birds,
bears, tigers and whales.
   In his last years he was forced to defend his father, Capt.
Robert Falcon Scott, against revisionist historians who claimed the
great polar explorer bungled the 1911-12 expedition in which he and
four companions perished of cold and hunger.
   Scott's death was announced Wednesday by the Wildlife and
Wetlands Trust, which he began in 1946 at Slimbridge on the Severn
River estuary where he lived. He founded it as a haven for water
birds after shooting a goose and seeing it die slowly.
   ``I thought I wouldn't do that to my worst enemy so why should I
do it to a goose,'' he recalled.
   Scott was a co-founder in 1961 of the Swiss-based World Wildlife
Fund, now the World Wide Fund for Nature. He designed its panda logo
and helped raise more than $60 million for 6,000 conservation
projects in 135 countries.
   The fund is largely credited with saving the Indian tiger and the
polar bear and with pioneering efforts to save rain forests.
   Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth II, her husband, Prince
Philip, and their son, Prince Charles, sent condolences to Scott's
widow, Philippa.
   Sir David Attenborough, the TV naturalist, described Scott as the
``patron saint of conservation _ one of the great figures who warned
the world of what was happening and not only warned but did
something about it.''
   Scott was 2 when his father died in March 1912 in the Antarctic
snows after being beaten to the South Pole by the Norwegian, Roald
Amundsen. The explorer left a note to his wife saying, ``Make the
boy interested in natural history; it is better than games.''
   His son said he felt having a hero for a father meant he had to
do well in different fields.
   Scott became a celebrated bird artist, won an Olympic yachting
bronze medal in 1936, was a thrice-decorated naval commander in
World War II, a champion glider pilot, America's Cup helmsman in
1964 and the first Briton to be knighted for services to
conservation, in 1973.
   He wrote or illustrated nearly 40 books and an autobiography,
``The Eye of the Wind'' in 1961.
   Scott was prominent in whale-saving efforts and said in 1987:
``If the pressure is kept up, all commercial whaling should cease
and the only whales killed would be for subsistence by people like
the Eskimos who take small numbers, and I think they should be
allowed to go on doing so.''
   He led expeditions of explorers and naturalists to many parts of
the world, including three in his father's footsteps to the
Antarctic, which he called the last environmental frontier.
   Scott believed in the Loch Ness Monster, saying it was a family
of prehistoric creatures living in the Scottish lake. He gave the
animal a scientific name, Nessiteras rhombopteryx, meaning Ness
monster with diamond fin.
   Scott and his family expressed anger in 1985 over a TV serial,
``The Last Place on Earth,'' based on a debunking book by Roland
Huntford called ``Scott and Amundsen.'' It depicted his father as an
incompetent loser and alleged that Capt. Scott's wife, Kathleen, had
an affair with another Norwegian explorer, Fridtjof Nansen, while
her husband was battling in the Antarctic.
   ``They were very friendly but I don't believe for an instant that
she had an affair with him,'' Sir Peter said.
   Scott is survived by his two wives and three children. In 1942,
he married the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard, by whom he had a
daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1951 and the same year he
married his secretary, Philippa Talbot-Ponsonby, who bore him a son
and a daughter.

<HEAD>US Defends Interim Role for Khmer Rouge, Blames Cambodia, Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration blamed Vietnam and
Cambodia on Wednesday for the collapse of a 19-nation peace
conference on Cambodia and reiterated its reluctant support for a
Khmer Rouge role in a transitional government.
   The conference, launched in late July in Paris by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and other foreign ministers, is dissolving
in disagreement over how to end the conflict between rival warring
actions.
   The collapse could result in stepped-up fighting between
government forces and an anti-communist resistance that includes
exiled Cambodian leader Prince Sihanouk and Khmer Rouge elements.
   When Baker flew to Paris to kick off the conference, there
already was recognition that a difficult compromise had to be struck
to end the civil war and that the deliberations could take months.
But there was guarded optimism the blood-letting might be ended with
diplomacy.
   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who hopes to retain power after
the scheduled withdrawal of 26,000 Vietnamese troops from Cambodia a
month from now, strenuously objected to any role for the Khmer
Rouge, who were ousted in an invasion by Vietnam in 1978 and still
have China's support.
   The Khmer Rouge, under then-leader Pol Pot, is believed
responsible for the massacre of at least 1 million Cambodians from
1975 to 1978.
   Speaking in Washington for the Bush administration, Margaret
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, registered unalterable
U.S. opposition to the Khmer Rouge returning to power. She called it
a ``murderous group.''
   However, she said the United States would continue to support
Sihanouk if he believed that Khmer Rouge elements, along with
members of the Phnom Penh government, ``should have an interim
role.''
   Asked why the conference had collapsed, she said ``it was not
possible to achieve a lasting settlement due to the failure of the
Vietnamese and Hun Sen regime to negotiate constructively on key
issues.''
   At the same time, the spokeswoman said ``progress was made toward
the important goal of a free and independent Cambodia.''
   ``Any progress is welcome and we should build upon it.''

   The Israeli army is creating a special unit to
help put down the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories after experimenting with soldiers specially trained in
riot control, an army spokesman said Wednesday.
   The move marks a break with Israeli military tradition in which
troops are trained mainly as combat soldiers for conventional
warfare.
   The new special force is intended to get regular combat troops
out of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and back to standard
training programs, said Col. Renaan Gissin, the army's deputy chief
spokesman.
   Gissin said two experimental special companies have been
operating in the occupied territories for several months. Their
formation followed complaints by some officers that duty in the
territories was cutting into regular training.
   The decision to form a permanent new unit was made after the
experimental companies proved effective in dealing with Palestinians
who have been waging an uprising against Israeli rule in lands
occupied in the 1967 Middle East war, Gissin said.
   At least 19 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were injured
Wednesday in new clashes in the occupied territories.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, two soldiers were injured
by stones and 11 Palestinians were shot and wounded when troops
opened fire during a stone-throwing melee, the army and Arab reports
said.
   Six Palestinians were shot and wounded in three other clashes in
the seaside strip.
   An army spokesman confirmed two Arabs wounded in the West Bank
and said the military was investigating other reports.
   At least 554 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with
soldiers or Israeli civilians during the uprising. Thirty-eight
Israeli also have been slain.
   ``These units will spend most of their service in one place,''
Gissin said, adding ``they will know the area and the population
better than troops that rotate in and out every three or four
months.''
   The special unit, dubbed the ``territories companies,'' will
receive specialized training on how to deal with stone- and
firebomb-throwing youths attacking troops in cities and villages,
Gissin said.
   He said they would operate better in such situations than elite
infantry units, trained to fight regular forces on a battlefield or
guerrillas attempting to infiltrate into the country.
   The daily Al-Hamishmar reported that new recruits are reluctant
to be sent to the experimental forces, which did more police duties
than the more glamorous combat units. But Gissin denied the report.
   ``We have had no problem in recruiting men and do not expect any
when we enlarge the unit,'' he said.
   All Israeli men do three years of compulsory military duty and
serve in the reserves for up to 60 days a year until the age of 54,
often in the occupied territories. Most women serve for two years in
non-combat units and later in the reserves until the age of 24.
   Gissin said the possibility of hurting soldiers' morale by having
them spend the majority of their three-year military service among
hostile civilians had been thoroughly examined by military
psychologists.
   ``Of course we examined the issue and we are confident the
soldiers will be OK,'' he said.

   The nation's schools are being attacked by
``self-appointed censors'' who want to ban or restrict profane or
satanic books and sanitize sex education classes, an anti-censorship
group said Wednesday.
   People For the American Way released its 7th annual report,
``Attacks on the Freedom to Learn,'' that claimed censorship and
other ideological attacks on public education by religious
extremists and members of right-wing organizations occurred in 42 of
the 50 states.
   The report singled out 172 incidents that it said occurred during
the 1988-89 school year, comparing them with the 157 the group
reported in 1987-88.
   ``I want to emphasize that what is at stake in the battles being
fought in communities across the nation is more than just the fate
of a few novels or a textbook or two,'' said John Buchanan, chairman
of the group founded by television producer Norman Lear.
   ``We are witnessing in these skirmishes the clash of two
competing views of public education in America. The censors see
efforts to teach our children about the world around them as a
threat; the rest of us see it as a way to broaden our children's
vistas and opportunities.''
   Sex education remains a major target by what the group described
as the far right, which ``already scored some damaging victories''
during the last school year, the report said.
   In South Carolina, for example, the report cited statewide
restrictions that forced school textbook publishers to delete
information on the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS.
   ``There is a growing ultra-conservative movement to restrict the
availability of information in the school about such topics as
contraception, abortion and AIDS,'' said President Arthur Kropp, who
predicted that ``attacks on sex education are likely to increase''
with recent Supreme Court rulings on reproductive rights.
   The report said school libraries were the target of significantly
more censorship attempts during the 1988-89 school year, accounting
for nearly half the challenges nationwide. It said that most of the
attacks it had investigated resulted in either removal of the
material or in restrictions on its use, such as requiring parental
consent.
   ``We are finding more and more instances in which self-appointed
censors focus not just on material in the curriculum but on
materials available in school libraries,'' said Kropp. ``Not content
with sanitizing classroom teaching, they want to scour the library
shelvs of any materials of which they disapprove.''
   The main targets of such challenges were literary classics such
as John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men'' and J.D. Salinger's ``The
Catcher in the Rye,'' as well as plays by Arthur Miller and
Aristophanes, the report said.
   The most frequent objections, the report said, were to materials
seen as containing ``offensive language'' and those perceived as
touching on ``satanism, witchcraft and the occult.'' Challenges to
satanism has grown over the last two years, said Donna Hulsizer,
author of the report.
   No challenges were reported in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho,
Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakato, Utah or the District of
Columbia, the report said. It said California led the nation with
what it called 23 censorship attempts.

<HEAD>Premier Says China's Economic Reforms to Continue; Paper Hits Zhao</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng said China's economic reforms
won't be abandoned, but official media Wednesday attacked a former
leader who helped foster those reforms.
   Li, in a speech seen Wednesday, said reforms adopted before June
will remain in effect and local governments can continue
experimenting with other reforms, Li said.
   ``Our policies can't be changed at will. This helps stabilize
people's hearts, stabilize stabilize the economy,''
Li said in a speech to the State Council, China's Cabinet.
   Protests by students demanding more social reforms to the ranks (and)
match
China's freer economy broke out April 15. China's leaders crushed
the pro-democracy movement with a military raid on demonstrators in
Beijing on June 3-4.
   Li gave the speech Aug. 15 but it was not published until
Tuesday, in Shanghai's Liberation Daily. The paper was seen in
Beijing on Wednesday. The release of speeches in China is often
delayed.
   Zhao Ziyang, the former Communist Party chief who helped carry
out China's liberalized economic reforms, wasn, increase the party's leadership
of enterprises in
ideological education, (and) develop the party's supervisory role.''
   The Beijing Daily commentary accused Zhao and his economic
adviser Bao Tong of violating the party constitution by advocating
policies that sought to reduce party interference in the economy and
to let some market forces rule.
   ``Bao Tong and others did their utmost to distort the supervisory
function of party organizations in enterprises (and) did everything
possible to limit and fetter'' them, the paper said.
   The reforms were beginning to see some success, with lively small
and medium-sized business and rural and township enterprises
invigorating the economy and making profits, unlike the ponderous,
state-owned enterprises. However, their rapid growth also caused
economic problems, such as shortages of raw materials and energy.
   The commentary quoted Zhao as saying in a 1986 meeting with
provincial governors, ``The big problems and issues in an enterprise
need not be discussed by the party committee. Otherwise, it would be
hard to put the (reforms) into effect. It is necessary to make some
some rather large changes to the original regulations.''
   Bao has been arrested and some reports say Zhao is under house
arrest.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French envoy held talks with Moslem
leaders in west Beirut on Wednesday amid rocket and artillery duels
between Syrian and Christian forces across the embattled Lebanese
capital.
   Police said at least three people were killed and 50 wounded in
the exchanges.
   The casualties raised the overall toll to at least 805 killed and
2,318 wounded since March 8, when fighting erupted between army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian units and Syrian
forces.
   The French diplomat, Francois Scheer, was accompanied by two
carloads of bodyguards on the trip from Christian east Beirut to the
Moslem sector across the embattled demarcation line.
   As he met with Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddine, the Shiite
Moslems' senior clergyman, five mortar rounds fired from the
Christian heartland exploded around the 10-story apartment building
in the Tallet Khayat district.
   The white-turbaned clergyman quickly ushered his guest to the
hallway near the elevator shaft for safety and continued their talks
for another 15 minutes.
   East Beirut also was under fire, and the wounded there included
two French communications engineers, police said.
   Scheer arrived in Beirut on Tuesday and met with Aoun and
Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir in east Beirut. He has
conferred in west Beirut with acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a
Sunni Moslem, Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite, and
Shiite militia chieftain Nabih Berri.
   Hoss heads a Cabinet competing for legitimacy with a three-man
government under Aoun.
   After his talks with Sfeir, Scheer, secretary-general of the
French Foreign Ministry, said: ``I'm trying to meet several Lebanese
leaders who are interested in inter-Lebanese dialogue.'' He did not
elaborate.
   The French ruled Lebanon from 1918 to 1943 and have traditionally
been the protectors of the Christians. They have antagonized Moslems
by dispatching a naval flotilla to the eastern Mediterranean to
evecuate French citizens if the crisis worsens.
   The French peace plan calls for lifting blockades imposed by both
sides, a halt to arms deliveries to the warring factions, political
reforms that will distribute power equally between Christians and
Moslems and the withdrawal of Syrian and Israeli forces from Lebanon.
   Syria has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon. They moved in under an
Arab League peacekeeping mandate in 1976 and are allied with Moslem
forces. Israel occupies a border strip in south Lebanon.
   The Voice of the People radio, the radio station of the
pro-Syrian Lebanese Communist Party, said Scheer's proposals have
been ``rejected by the nationalist (leftist) forces.''
   Moslems fear that if the blockade of the Christian enclave is
lifted without inspection of ships, Aoun will bring in more weapons
from Iraq, his main backer and Syria's archrival in the Arab world.
   The independent daily An-Nahar said Scheer told Moslems that Aoun
has demanded ``international guarantees to stop Syrian arms
shipments to the Moslem and leftist militias.''
   An Aoun aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
general ``does not accept the formation of an inter-Lebanese
committee to monitor arms supplies because we haven't been fighting
Lebanese factions.''
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio accused ``the Syrians and
their allies'' of escalating fighting ``to confuse any effort or
mediation to end the sufferings of the Lebanese...''
   The police spokesman said the duels Wednesday escalated at 1:20
a.m. after Syrian gunners shelled Christian-controlled waters north
of Beirut.
   Police said Aoun's coast guard command called off a search for
two missing sailors of the Maltese-flag tanker Sunshield, which was
hit by Syrian shellfire off the Christian coast on Tuesday.
   ``The two are presumed dead,'' the police spokesman said.
   Two wounded Lebanese sailors of the ship's 11-man crew were
rescued Tuesday and the bodies of seven others washed ashore.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler said
the United States ``deeply deplores'' the Syrian attack on the ship.
   ``This incident points out the immediate need for all sides to
accept the cease-fire, lift the blockades, and allow a process of
political dialogue to begin under Arab League auspices,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, Soviet envoy Gennady Tarasov headed home after a
10-day tour in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, aimed at ending the
fighting.

<HEAD>Dorothy Schiff, Former Post Publisher, Dead At 86</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dorothy Schiff, the ``rich girl'' who for 37
years ran the New York Post with a liberal editorial stance and a
tight rein on finances, died Wednesday of cancer. She was 86.
   Schiff, who had been ill since May, died at her home, said Peter
Faris, a vice president at the Post.
   Schiff bought the Post in 1939 at the behest of her husband. She
sold it to media magnate Rupert Murdoch in 1976 for a reported $31
million.
   In between, she commanded the fortunes of a newspaper which, in
her words, advocated ``honest unionism, social reform and humane
government programs.''
   Under Schiff the Post was a middle-class tabloid known for its
features, columns and liberal views.
   While other New York newspapers withered and died _ the
Journal-American, the World Telegram and Sun, the Herald Tribune,
the Mirror _ the Post survived, and eventually became the only
afternoon paper in the city.
   ``Often voted least likely to succeed in New York's competitive
journalistic climate, she outmaneuvered'' and outlasted rivals,
Newsweek once wrote.
   Dorothy Schiff, known to many as Dolly, was born in New York City
in 1903. Her grandfather was financier Jacob Schiff, a founder of
the Kuhn, Loeb banking house and a prominent philanthropist.
   The young heiress studied at New York's exclusive Brearly School
and attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.
   ``I was a rich kid of the right kind _ not the robber baron type
_ and had been to the right schools,'' she once observed.
   As an adult, she was thrifty: ``I don't know if it's fear of
being self-indulgent or a puritanical guilt, but spending just isn't
easy for me.''
   In later years, Schiff's tight fist was legendary. The Post
always seemed to do more with less _ the smallest staff, the most
decrepit equipment.
   In the early 1930s, Schiff got involved in a number of social
welfare efforts _ a settlement house for immigrants, several
hospitals, a club that provided lunches to women looking for jobs in
New York.
   By birth, Schiff was a Republican. But the Depression, and the
response of the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, led her to
change her affiliation. She became a confidante of both the
president and Eleanor Roosevelt, and at one point declined
Roosevelt's invitation to run a program for farm women.
   In 1939, Schiff bought the Post at the request of her husband,
George Backer, an appointee to City Council who ran unsuccessfully
for Congress. At first, Backer served as editor and president; she
served as director and vice president, and her ownership was not
public knowledge.
   Financial losses led Schiff to conclude that the paper needed
comic strips, columns, features and a tabloid format. When Backer
disagreed, Schiff promoted Theodore Olin Thackrey from feature
editor to executive editor.
   In 1942, Schiff became president and publisher. She divorced
Backer in 1943 and married Thackrey.
   ``When I took on the Post, I didn't have much faith in myself or
the paper, and I didn't really think I could pull it out. Now, it's
part of me _ we are part of each other,'' Schiff said in a 1976
biography, ``Men, Money and Magic,'' by Jeffrey Potter.
   Her notion that features would build readership paid off _ the
Post's magazine-style stories and pages of columns (at one point in
the 1940s, the Post had nearly 50 columnists, including Schiff
herself) had faithful followers.
   The Post also became known for its sports coverage, although
Schiff confided later, ``I never read a sports page in my life.''
   She and Thackrey differed in print in 1948. Both opposed Harry
Truman, but Thackrey supported Progressive candidate Henry Wallace
and Schiff backed Republican Thomas E. Dewey. By 1950, Thackrey was
out, both as editor and as Schiff's husband.
   In the 1950s, under James Wechsler, the Post became known for
investigative reporting. Wechsler eventually relinquished control of
the news department and took over the editorial page, and in the
1960s the newspaper's features became softer.
   After years of profits, the paper's fortunes dimmed in the 1970s
as much of its audience moved to the suburbs. Ultimately, Schiff
sold it to Murdoch. ``It was a terrible headache,'' she said.
   Murdoch transformed the Post into a racier, more conservative
tabloid before selling it to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow
in 1988.
   Schiff's four marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was
Richard B.W. Hall, followed by Backer, Thackrey and Rudolf Sonneborn.
   She is survived by her two daughters, Adele Hall Sweet and
Sarah-Ann Kramarsky, her son Mortimer H. Hall, 15 grandchildren and
nine great-grandchildren.
   A private burial was planned.

   A Philippine Constabulary officer was
relieved of his command two weeks after he led an assault to free
hostages held by inmates in a siege in which 21 people died, the
military announced Wednesday.
   Legislators have criticized the military's handling of the crisis
in Davao City.
   However, Wilfred Garcia, the constabulary spokesman in Davao
City, gave no reason for the transfer of Capt. Poblio Gildo and
refused to say if it was connected to the hostage crisis.
   Gildo led the assault to end a three-day crisis when an
Australian missionary and 15 other people were held hostage by 16
prisoners.
   All the prisoners and five hostages, including the missionary,
were killed before troops regained control of the jail, 610 miles
southeast of Manila.
   Gildo was reassigned to the regional constabulary headquarters in
Davao but was not immediately given specific duties, Garcia said.
Gildo was succeeded by his deputy as commander of Davao City's 431st
Philippines Constabulary Company.
   Australian officials have said the missionary's wounds indicated
she may have been slain by government snipers who opened fire during
an abortive jailbreak a few hours before the prison was stormed.

<HEAD>Changes Scheduled for Treatment of Lab Animals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some changes in federal regulations affecting
the care and handling of laboratory animals will go into effect Oct.
30, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Among the changes will be a requirement that research facilities
create special committees to assure humane care and treatment of
animals.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the revisions ``will partially
implement'' amendments to the federal Animal Welfare Act passed by
Congress almost four years ago.
   The amendments provide new and stricter requirements to protect
laboratory animals from undue pain and stress, tighten enforcement
of rules already on the books, and revise the list of definitions
needed to carry out the law.
   Current regulations define standards for animal use, including
minimum requirements for handling, housing, feeding, watering,
sanitation, ventilation, shelter and veterinary care.
   Glosser said the revisions will make the rules for dogs, cats and
non-human primates, including monkeys, more complete and easier to
understand.
   Besides requiring research facilities to create special animal
care committees, the new regulations include provisions for
veterinary care, and holding facilities and handling.
   The Animal Welfare Act covers most businesses that buy or sell
warm-blooded animals, exhibit them and transport them commercially.
Rats, mice, birds, horses and farm animals are not covered by the
regulations.
   An agency spokeswoman, Pat El-Hinnawy, said there are three parts
to the package of regulatory changes. The final decisions announced
Wednesday affect only the first and second parts.
   Part One includes a definition of terms used in carrying out the
1985 amendments, she said. Part Two relates to the identification
methods, records, licensing requirements and other details.
   Part Three, which is still under study by the agency, will
include details of the actual standards for federal regulation of
animal care _ the space each must have, access to food and water,
and other details that affect their routines.
   El-Hinnawy said she didn't know when USDA might decide on final
rules for Part Three.

<TEXT>
   A TV camera lowered into the damaged Three
Mile Island reactor confirmed small cracks in a steel liner,
officials said Wednesday.
   The cracks in the Unit 2 reactor appear to be tears in the thin
stainless steel lining inside the 5-inch-thick carbon steel reactor
vessel, which contains the radioactive fuel and hot water
surrounding it, the plant operator said.
   Still unanswered is whether the cracks extend from the liner into
the reactor vessel.
   ``There isn't any way to tell definitely, but it's not considered
likely,'' said Doug Bedell, spokesman for the plant operator, GPU
Nuclear Corp.
   The reactor was damaged in 1979 in the U.S. nuclear power
industry's worst accident.
   The investigation of the cracks required a newly developed
radiation-resistant, high-resolution camera and special tools to
brush debris from the area, probe the cracks and take measurements
through 40 feet of water.
   The liner, three-sixteenths of an inch thick, prevents corrosion
of the steel below it. High fuel temperatures and the difference in
the contraction rates between the two types of steel caused the
cracks or tears, GPU Nuclear said.
   One crack was 6 inches long, about three-thirty-seconds of an
inch wide and about one-sixteenth of an inch deep, GPU Nuclear said.
Three other cracks were from 3 to 5 inches long, the plant operator
said.
   The color pictures taken Saturday revealed a few additional
cracks in an area where two lines thought to be cracks were spotted
in July, GPU Nuclear said.
   Molten uranium fuel as hot as 5,000 degrees flowed to the
reactor's bottom during the March 1979 accident that damaged the
reactor. A series of operator and mechanical errors cut off cooling
water to the radioactive core and about half the fuel rods melted.
Radioactive gas was released to the atmosphere.
   Since the accident, there has been no evidence that the vessel
was breached, Bedell said.
   TMI's Unit 1 reactor was undamaged and remains in service.
   Under a program sponsored in part by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, samples of the steel will be removed for study by
researchers from Europe and Japan. The work is expected to take up
to 2{ years.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Political leaders said Wednesday
that two coalitions have been formed to field candidates in general
elections that may be held next year.
   Marc Bazin said he has forged an alliance with two other
prominent leaders, center-leftist Serge Gilles and Dejean Belizaire,
a supporter of Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   ``We hope to offer the people a credible coalition, an
opportunity to have a government of the people, by the people and
for the people,'' said Bazin, a front-runner in the Nov. 29, 1987,
elections that were aborted by violence, .
   Bazin now heads the center-right Movement for the Installation of
Democracy Party.
   His coalition _ the National Alliance for Democracy and Progress
_ will present a joint platform and common candidates for general
elections, which the independent Electoral Council said would not be
held before next year.
   The council is expected to announce next month a calendar for
local, legislative and presidential elections.
   Bazin said most of the platform has been written but refused to
disclose its content. He said the coalition is negotiating including
other moderate leaders in its ranks.
   Three other prominent moderate politicians _ Louis Dejoie, Gerard
Philippe-Auguste and Hubert de Ronceray, all leading candidates in
the 1987 canceled elections _ met Wednesday to negotiate a coalition
of their own.
   De Ronceray, head of the rightist Mobilization for National
Development party, said they intended to find a ``common program to
run the country.'' They have no formal name for the coalition so far
nor have they announced a platform.
   Dejoie said he invited Sylvio Claude, also a major candidate in
1987, to join the coalition.
   Bazin, Claude, Dejoie and center-leftist Gerard Gourge were the
four top contenders in 1987 when thugs protected by soldiers
massacred at least 34 voters at polling stations and caused the
elections to be canceled.
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who ruled Haiti at that time, dissolved
the independent Electoral Council and said he would hold new
elections.
   The four leading presidential candidates boycotted Namphy's
elections in January 1988, which brought Leslie Manigat to power.
Foes of the government said those army-run elections were riddled
with fraud.
   De Ronceray and Philippe-Auguste both agreed to take part in that
balloting despite a major boycott by voters.
   Namphy ousted Manigat in June 1988, and was himself ousted the
following September in a soldiers' revolt which brought Avril to
power.
   Avril pledged a return to democratic rule and encouraged creation
of the new Electoral Council, which was appointed by institutions
that included the Roman Catholic Church, trade unions and human
rights groups.

   Armed with evidence showing that 77 percent of
the nation's adolescent deaths each year are preventable, doctors
and educators joined Wednesday to form a group to attack problems
confronting youth.
   A national commission on adolescent health was formed by the
National Association of State Boards of Education and the American
Medical Association.
   The commission was formed, said Roseann Bentley, president of the
education association, ``when we observed that we could not reduce
our young people's vulnerability to AIDS, alcohol and drug
addiction, heart disease and other preventable illness without
changing their behavior.''
   ``Hungry, sick, violated, abused, doped up kids cannot learn,''
said Bentley. ``Research tells us that `one-shot' education programs
do not work, and that comprehensive multi-component programs that
change behavior are critical. I cannot overemphasize the need for
schools, families and communities to work together. ...''
   Ms. Bentley will serve as commission co-chairman along with Dr.
M. Roy Schwarz of the American Medical Association. Others on the
31-member commission include former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop,
Florida Education Commission Betty Castor, Illinois Gov. James
Thompson, California School Chief Bill Honig and pollster George
Gallup Jr.
   William Hendee, AMA vice president for science and technology,
said an estimated 77 percent of the nation's adolescent deaths each
year are preventable. In the 1950s, 75 percent of deaths of youths
aged 10 to 19 years were due to natural causes, compared with only
27 percent in the 1980s.
   Hendee added that more than 75 percent of seniors who tried
cigarettes first and almost 53 percent of seniors who have gotten
drunk first did so before starting high school. Rates for suicide
and birth for teens 10- to 14-years-old have gone up dramatically in
recent years.
   Both the AMA and education association said national attention
and community based efforts should focus on comprehensive school
health programs for all grades, kindergarten through 12th, and
particularly on programs for the disadvantaged and those involved in
risky or life-threatening behaviors.

   Anti-abortion activists Wednesday claimed
Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's election to succeed late Florida
Rep. Claude Pepper proves that their movement is ``alive and well''
in the wake of the Supreme Court's July 3 decision on abortion.
   Abortion rights supporters, however, said abortion was not a key
issue in the race between Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Democrat Gerald
Richman, who had the support of abortion rights activists.
   During the campaign, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, 37, a state senator, said
she favored more restrictions on abortion and Richman said he
favored more choice. However, with polls indicating most voters
supported abortion rights, the GOP candidate said abortion was more
of a state legislative issue than a congressional issue.
   Sandra Faucher, director of the National Right to Life Political
Action Committee, told reporters the organization made a $1,000
contribution to Ms. Ros-Lehtinen in the Republican primary election
and spent about $15,000 for activities on her behalf in the general
election campaign.
   ``Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's win is a pivotal victory for the pro-life
movement,'' Ms. Faucher said at a news conference. ``Clearly, the
net pro-life increment is alive and well after the Webster
decision.''
   The Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling, giving states greater power to
limit abortions, appeared on the court's docket as Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services.
   Ms. Faucher also said that abortion was ``a highly visible
issue'' in the Aug. 12 special election in Texas in which Republican
Bob Lanier, an abortion opponent, defeated Democrat Jim Lane for the
seat of former Speaker of the House Jim Wright.
   She said anti-abortion candidates also have won six of eight
state legislative races since the Supreme Court decision.
   Abortion rights leaders have contended that state legislative
victories in two races in California and South Carolina indicated
movement in their direction in the wake of the court ruling.
   Ms. Faucher, however, said anti-abortion candidates have won in
races in Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and two Florida
legislative districts.
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, denied that abortion was a major issue in the
Florida and Texas congressional races or the legislative contests
cited by Ms. Faucher.
   ``The anti-choice movement is stretching a major point to claim
victory on the issue of abortion in that (Florida) race,'' she said.
``That was not the issue.''
   Republicans hailed Ros-Lehtinen's election as a major victory,
noting that Pepper had held the seat for the Democrats since 1962
when the seat was created. Pepper died May 30 at age 88.
   According to unofficial returns, predominantly Latin precincts
had turnouts of more than 60 percent and gave Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, the
first Cuban-American elected to Congress, 80 percent to 90 percent
of the vote. She carried the entire district by a 53 percent to 47
percent margin.
   Ms. Faucher, however, said ``Ileana could not have won the vote
with just the Hispanic vote. There is not a majority of Hispanics in
the district.''
   ``There had to be other issues involved, and we feel that
definitely the abortion issue played a major factor in the race,''
she said.
   Ms. Michelman, however, said, ``Nothing was an issue there that
could supersede the ethnicity issue. The fact is that no issue, even
the issue of choice, could overwhelm the ethnicity issue.''
   Ms. Michelman said the abortion rights group contributed $5,000
to Richman's campaign and spent about $2,500 on get-out-the-vote
efforts.

   The drug control strategy President Bush will
present next week will call for $250 million to $260 million in
economic and military aid for the three main principal producing
countries _ Colombia, Peru and Bolivia _ an administration source
said Wednesday.
   Earlier, sources had said that aid figure could hit $300 million,
and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft indicated Tuesday that
the figure would be even higher than that.
   When asked about the reported $300 million figure for the Andean
countries, Scowcroft said, ``That figure, I think you can assume,
has already been increased by the fact that we have given Colombia
$65 million'' to help it fight the ``total war'' declared by the
drug traffickers there.
   However, the $65 million is coming out of a discretionary fund
available for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. The strategy covers
fiscal 1990.
   Scowcroft had not intended to add the $65 million onto next
year's budget, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   President Bush met with his top lieutenants in the drug war
Tuesday at his vacation home in Kennebunkport to discuss the
strategy, but sources said Wednesday that the focus of the meeting
was Colombia, not the strategy, and that no specific decisions were
made on changing plans for future aid to that country.
   ``The fundamental issues of the strategy, Kennebunkport did not
change,'' one of the sources said, noting that the final strategy
had gone to the printer before the meeting took place. The source
declined to be named publicly.
   Colombia has suffered numerous bombings by drug traffickers since
Colombian President Virgilio Barco imposed emergency regulations 1{
weeks ago that allow for the immediate resumption of extraditions of
alleged drug traffickers to the United States for trial.
   Last Friday, Bush announced the United States would give Colombia
$65 million in military equipment such as helicopters, in addition
to some $2.5 million for protection for the Colombian judiciary that
had been promised previously. Congress last year set aside $5
million for such protection. Colombian Justice Minister Monica de
reiff asked Tuesday for $19 million in aid for judicial protection.
   The drug strategy, meanwhile, will urge states to impose tough
laws against drug users, but won't threaten to withhold highway
funds from those states that fail to do so, as the draft strategy
had proposed, an administration source said Wednesday.
   In addition, a proposed $25 million National Drug Intelligence
Center, to be run jointly by the Drug Enforcement Administration and
the FBI, was eliminated from the strategy due to a last-minute bid
by the Treasury Department to develop a money-laundering
intelligence center and combine all the elements, the source said.
The Justice Department objected to the sudden change of plans.
   ``Justice said, `Wait a minute. Let's step back and do this
right,''' said the source.
   However, most of the elements included in the draft strategy _
the emphasis on targeting drug abusers who fuel the drug traffic,
the hiking of funds for drug treatment by 49 percent and the need
for massively increased aid to the Andean countries _ remain the
same as proposed originally by William J. Bennett, director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy, the source said.
   The final strategy is being kept under such ``close hold'' by the
White House that many people who received copies of the draft must
go to the Old Executive Office Building to read the final version.
   ``Aside from the copy in the OEOB, I think the only people who
have it are those on the Domestic Policy Council, the National
Security Council and a few of the president's closest advisers,''
the source said.
   Copies of the draft strategy were leaked to the press shortly
after it was produced in late July.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine Wednesday, the vacation White House press
office announced that a new program allowing judges to strip student
loans and other federal benefits from drug offenders starts Friday.
   The vacationing President Bush sent Congress a report on
Wednesday spelling out how the penalties will work in both state and
federal courts.
   Those convicted of drug trafficking or possession can be denied
federal grants, student loans, contracts, and professional and
commercial licenses, but not welfare, disability or Social Security
benefits.
   The decision to deny any or all of an individual's benefits rests
solely with the sentencing judge, except for those convicted of a
third drug trafficking offense. For them, permanent denial of the
benefits is mandatory.
   Bush's letter to Congress outlined plans to carry out the
program, required by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
   He said he is asking the U.S. Sentencing Commission to inform
federal courts of the program, and the Justice Department will serve
as a clearinghouse of information on those stripped of their benefit
eligibility in the federal courts.
   In addition, Bush said the Justice Department will ``coordinate
the participation of the state courts in this program.'' It will ask
the chief judicial officer in each state to direct its courts to
collect and forward the data on state court denials.
   Justice will then forward the information to the General Services
Administration for inclusion on the federal procurement debarment
list.
   The penalties can be applied to convictions occurring after
Friday for offenses occuring on or after Nov. 18, 1988.
   Next Tuesday, Bush will go on radio and television to describe
his new national drug strategy that is expected to stiffen penalties
for individual users.

<HEAD>Second Shipload of PCBs Arrives in Quebec Town</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BAIE-COMEAU, Quebec (AP) _ A second shipload of PCBs arrived at
this St. Lawrence River port Wednesday, the day after riot police
used clubs to disperse protesters so an earlier shipment could be
moved to temporary storage nearby.
   Judge Paul Corriveau of Quebec Superior Court turned down
applications by a citizen coalition in Baie-Comeau, Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney's hometown, for injunctions forbidding long-term
storage of polychlorinated biphenals, or PCBs, from elsewhere in
Quebec.
   It was the second consecutive day the coalition lost a legal
battle to prevent the unloading of toxic PCBs produced in
St.-Basile-le-Grand, Quebec, and destined for a nearby Hydro-Quebec
storage site. The waste was shipped to Britain for destruction, but
longshoremen refused to unload it.
   On Tuesday, shortly after refusal of the first applications,
police cleareed the way to the Manic 2 storage site for six trucks
loaded with PCB-laced oil.
   A V-formation of about 40 helmeted officers, truncheons held
chest-high, pushed through dozens of noisy demonstrators so the
convoy could leave the dock. Police said no one was injured and
there were no arrests.
   The waste had been on the wharf for six days after arriving on
the Nadezhda Obukhova, a Soviet freighter.
   Another Soviet freighter, the Khudozhnik Pakhomov, arrived
Wednesday after a two-week voyage from Britain.
   Provincial police tightened patrols around the dock area and
closed the area to passers-by.
   ``It's not over yet,'' said Shirley Kennedy, a lawyer for the
coalition of citizen groups. ``This is just one battle that has been
lost.''
   The shuttle of PCBs back and forth across the Atlantic has been
seen as an embarrassment for Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa's
Liberal Party as the Sept. 25 provincial election approaches.
   PCBs produce toxic byproducts such as dioxins and furans when
incompletely burned.

<HEAD>Welfare Department Issued Fake Social Security Numbers to Illegals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts welfare workers assigned hundreds of
dummy Social Security numbers to illegal immigrants to enable them
to receive millions of dollars in state benefits.
   Federal officials said Wednesday there's nothing illegal about
it. But Gov. Michael Dukakis says it's got to stop because it goes
against his new efforts to crack down on aid to illegal aliens,
which he says the state can no longer afford.
   The practice started after Dukakis issued a 1985 executive order
barring state agencies from asking people applying for state
services about their citizenship status.
   But citizens or not, the computerized welfare records required a
case identification number for each person, and that had to be a
nine-digit number since for most people the ID is the same as their
Social Security number.
   Dukakis' legal counsel, Don Stern, said the law setting up the
general relief program, a totally state-financed welfare program for
people who don't qualify for federal welfare, left it up to the
Welfare Department if applicants didn't have a Social Security
number.
   Welfare spokeswoman Michal Regunberg said the department issued
its own control numbers.
   Welfare Department attorney Thomas Noonan said the dummy numbers
started with a three-digit prefix not used by the Social Security
Administration.
   Regunberg said those control numbers would have been rejected by
Social Security Administration computers, so they could not have
been used to obtain federally subsidized welfare or by an illegal
alien seeking a job.
   John Connolly, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration
in Boston, said there is nothing illegal under federal law with
using ID numbers with the same number of digits as Social Security
numbers.
   ``As far as we are concerned, there is nothing illegal,''
Connolly said.
   Welfare Commissioner Carmen Camino-Siegrist said illegal aliens
made up 400 to 500 of the 28,500 people in Massachusetts getting
General Relief.
   Both she and Human Services Secretary Philip W. Johnston said
some recipients without Social Security numbers were U.S. citizens
who were mentally ill or severely mentally retarded and had never
obtained a Social Security card.
   Dukakis said Wednesday he had not known dummy numbers were issued
to illegals applying for general relief.
   ``But I think in fairness to the people at the Welfare
Department, they were trying to help some folks who basically came
in off the street, were in dire need and had no other means of
support,'' Dukakis said in an interview with radio station WTAG in
Worcester, where he was on an official trip.
   Dukakis said that in many cases the people ``were political
refugees who faced death if they went back to their home countries.''
   However, Dukakis announced recently he was changing state policy
to remove illegal aliens from relief rolls, a move officials
estimated would save about $1 million a year.
   ``Because of the fiscal situation, we just can't continue to do
this and we won't. We've got to stop it,'' Dukakis said.
   Muriel Heiberger, director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and
Refugee Coalition, said she may challenge the change of policy in
court.
   ``This move on the part of the governor represents a tragic
retreat from the commonwealth's previous commitment to help people
who fled their countries because of persecution, violence or
economic necessity,'' she said.

   Samuel Pisar saw the 50th anniversary of
World War II as a time to celebrate the triumph over evil, but the
dispute over a convent near the Auschwitz death camp he survived has
cast a shadow on his efforts at reconciliation.
   At the request of composer Leonard Bernstein, Pisar has written a
personal reminiscence of the destruction in his native land that he
will read at a concert Friday to mark the anniversary of the 1939
invasion of Poland by Germany that began the war.
   ``I decided to tackle it out of solidarity and out of a need for
reconciliation, because I don't believe in hereditary enemies of
history,'' Pisar said.
   ``This 50th anniversary is a very good moment to celebrate our
triumph over evil and move to a more hopeful future. I am telling a
Polish story, but also a Jewish story,'' he said.
   Pisar will narrate the concert which is to be broadcast live to
more than 20 countries. He plans to relate his experience, which he
says epitomizes that of many who endured World War II.
   He was 10 when the war struck his home city of Bialystok in
northeastern Poland. His mother wanted to flee, but his father,
whose family had been in Bialystok for several generations, did not.
   Pisar was the only member of his family to survive the years that
followed. The Gestapo killed his father and he lost his mother and
sister to the concentration camps that claimed the lives of at least
6 million other Jews.
   Sent from Auschwitz to camps in Germany as a forced laborer,
Pisar escaped from Dachau and was liberated by the American Army at
the age of 16.
   Now a lawyer in Paris, Pisar has made three previous trips to
Poland, accompanying American senators, international bankers and
former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
   This trip is more personal. Pisar brought his wife and three
children with him to visit his native city of Bialystok in
northeastern Poland and then to travel to Auschwitz.
   They have arrived to find that 50 years has not healed the
spiritual wounds of war, and that the historic tension between
Catholic and Jews still impedes reconciliation.
   The Roman Catholic hierarchy's decision Aug. 10 to abrograte a
1987 agreement to move a Carmelite convent away from the Auschwitz
camp and remarks Saturday by the leader of Poland's Roman Catholic
church has left many Jews, including Pisar, troubled.
   ``I am happy to be here and I feel that peace is fragile and the
spark of freedom that we witness here today and that is so
encouraging, is fragile and yet I feel a discomfort, I feel a pain,
deep physical pain,'' Pisar said.
   ``For some strange reason at this precise moment of history to
focus on tensions between Jews and Poles _ the two people that
suffered more than any others from the Second World War _ seems not
only unnecessary but ... why give Hitler, posthumously, such a
satisfaction?'' he said.
   As one of the youngest camps survivors, Pisar says he feels
compelled to speak out.
   ``I don't want any polemics with the cardinal, but with due
respect, his words, even if well-intended, were ill-chosen. I am
disappointed and surprised,'' Pisar said.
   He was referring to an address by Cardinal Jozef Glemp at the
Jasna Gora Monastery in Czestochowa, Poland's most revered shrine,
in which Glemp said there would be no anti-Semitism in Poland if
Jews abandon anti-Polish sentiments.
   Speaking about the convent, Glemp said the nuns wanted to be a
symbol of human solidarity with the living and the dead and that
asking them to leave would offend the feelings of Poles.
   Pisar acknowledged that not only Jews were killed in Auschwitz,
but he said the site belongs to no one and that he could not
tolerate the appropriation of the Holocaust by Christian symbols.
   ``Auschwitz is a place that belongs to everybody and no one,'' he
said. ``It is the greatest wound ever inflicted on our civilization
and its deserves respect ... silence.''
   ``I feel no anger to the Carmelite nuns. I think they are sincere
in their desire to pray. I respect that, but I think it would be
better if they prayed outside the perimeter of the death camp and I
think God would be able to hear them better if they did,'' he said.
   Pisar said he hoped that Pope John Paul II would use his moral
authority to stop the dispute before it festers.
   ``He can bring it to a stop, and I wish he would, and that the
dead would be left alone because it is really needed out of respect
for the dead and compassion for the living.'' He said.

   School lunchroom cooks are hampered in efforts
to provide nutritious meals because the government donates mainly
``fat-laden foods'' such as ground beef, pork and luncheon meats, a
consumer health group said Wednesday.
   Ellen Haas, director of the Public Voice for Food and Health
Policy, criticized the Agriculture Department, the agency
responsible for administering the National School Lunch Program, for
``not providing the critical leadership necessary to speed progress
in reducing fat in school lunches.''
   Scott Dunn, acting administator of USDA's Food and Nutrition
Service, countered by saying the department is committed to dietary
guidelines developed jointly with the Department of Health and Human
Services. He said the guidelines don't set quantitative standards
for fat.
   ``There is no scientific consensus on appropriate levels of fat
in children's diets,'' Dunn said.
   And the American School Food Service Association noted in a
statement that ``children's eating habits are influenced by multiple
factors such as home, school, and restaurants.'' It said parents and
community groups must share responsibility for improving young
people's dietary preferences.
   The consumer group said its survey of school food service
directors shows, nevertheless, that the government school lunch
program lends little encouragement to dieticians seeking to lower
the fat content of lunches.
   Public Voice said 67 percent of 177 school food service directors
surveyed told it that the USDA's commodity distribution program is
one of the most significant barriers to their efforts to provide
nutritious meals. More than 24 million children participated in
lunch programs at more than 91,000 schools during the 1988-89
academic year.
   The school lunch programs depend, to some extent, on commodities
provided free of charge by the federal government, to help them stay
afloat financially, the group said. ``Yet,'' it said, ``the
commodities offered include a high proportion of fat-laden foods.''
   Public Voice said that Agriculture Department-disbursed commodity
foods account for about 30 percent of foods used for school lunches.
Of the total estimated dollar value of the commodities available _
$817.4 million _ ground beef and pork, luncheon meat and ham,
butter, cheese and eggs constituted well over 50 percent, it said.
   Of the ``bonus'' commodities offered to schools _ or commodities
furnished above the basic allotments _ butter, cheese, pork, beef,
and eggs comprised more than 90 percent of the dollar value, the
group said.
   It said that more than 80 percent of the directors surveyed said
they have taken some steps to reduce fat in their school lunches.
   Contrary to Dunn's statement, Public Voice said there is a
consensus among health professionals that fat in children's diets
should be reduced to about 30 percent of calories.
   Among other findings were these:
   _Only 6 percent of the directors surveyed had established target
levels or ranges for fat in their programs. Central city school
districts were eight times more likely to establish such limits than
were rural districts.
   _Seventy-seven percent reported having limited access to written
matrials or training programs on how to purchase foods or modify
recipes to reduce fat content. Twenty-three percent said they did
not receive any guidance or guidelines.
   _When asked to identify the single most important thing that
could be done to help reduce fat, 50 percent of the respondents said
the commodity program should be changed and 26 percent said more
nutritional education should be provided. The remaining 24 percent
were uncertain.
   Public Voice recommended that the Agriculture Department provide
greater leadership in educating school food service directors and in
offering assistance in planning monthly menus, including suggesting
how often specific foods should be served.
   The USDA also should significantly expand the availability of
lower-fat commodities to the schools, the group said.
   Said Dunn: ``It is important to remember that no matter what
level is deemed appropriate, that level must be applied to a
person's entire diet, not to a single food or a single meal. USDA
cannot at this time support setting quantitative fat standards or
recommended frequency of serving certain foods.''
   The variety of foods donated to schools is under constant review,
he said, adding that ``over the years significant progress has been
made in providing more and more healthy, wholesome foods, including
additional low-and reduced-fat foods.''
   Dunn also said his agency promotes and coordinates nutrition
education and technical assistance for all involved in the school
lunch program, although he said that states ``have great flexibility
in how they spend the money they have available for training.''
   The American Food Service Association said in its statement that
young people's dietary habits are largely affected by national
advertising, which it called ``a major influence on children's food
preferences.''
   ``If change is to become a reality, dietary modifications in
school menus must be supported by parents and the community,'' it
said.

Coors, Estee Lauder, Arnold Schwarzenegger,'' the Bush letter said.
``I know you will enjoy meeting your fellow members at Inner Circle
gatherings both in Washington, D.C., and around the country.''
   Weiss said Wednesday he respectfully declines.
   ``And all this time I thought I was a dyed-in-the-wool liberal,''
he said. ``Either my fellow congressmen from across the aisle have
had a change of heart or I've been terribly misinformed about their
political philosophy.''
   But why would D'Amato nominate Weiss in the first place?
   According to D'Amato spokeswoman Zenia Mucha, he didn't.
   ``The senator lends his name for fund-raising for the party,''
she said. Weiss's name ``must have been on some mailing list that
was not purged.''
   Wendy DeMocker, spokeswoman for the Republican Senatorial
Committee, said: ``We're not going to consider it a mistake. We're
going to say, well, there's hope for everybody.''
   She ticked the names off several onetime Democrats who switched
to the GOP: Ronald Reagan, Elizabeth Dole, Jeane Kirkpatrick.
   ``And so if Congressman Weiss received one of these, well, we've
certainly had a lot of members of Congress in the House of
Representatives recently convert to the Republican Party,'' she said.

   Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's election to
Congress after an ethnically divisive campaign for the late Claude
Pepper's seat was celebrated Wednesday as a first for
Cuban-Americans and a Southern milestone for the GOP.
   ``The Cubans won!'' salsa singer Celia Cruz shouted in Spanish as
she led Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's supporters in a victory party early
Wednesday following the Republican's win over Gerald Richman.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, a 37-year-old educator and state senator,
promised to work to heal the wounds left by the contest, which ended
Tuesday with voting along ethnic lines.
   ``I think it's been a terribly divisive ... campaign,'' she said
on NBC's ``Today'' show. The special election was made necessary by
Pepper's death May 30 at 88. Pepper, a Democrat, had held the seat
since its creation in 1962.
   Riding heavy Hispanic turnout, the Havana-born Republican
received 49,638 votes, or 53 percent, to 43,759 votes, or 47
percent, for Richman, a 38-year-old, Brooklyn-born attorney making
his first bid for elective office.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said Richman, who carried the black and
non-Latin white vote by about 90 percent, had spurred Hispanics by
making them feel as if ``we might be second-class Americans because
we're naturalized Americans.''
   ``But now it's time for healing, now we have to reach out to all
those sections,'' she said.
   Richman didn't rule out seeking the seat again in the next
scheduled election in 14 months but promised to try to help his
opponent to ``unify the community.''
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's swearing-in in Washington is expected to take
place early next month.
   Cubans, who began Latinizing Miami after Fidel Castro's 1959
revolution, have achieved a number of firsts this decade: mayor of
Miami, a majority on the City Commission, county manager and city
manager.
   During the campaign, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen refused to debate Richman
for declaring, ``This is an American seat'' _ a remark that many
claimed was anti-Hispanic.
   Richman said the remark was an appeal to voters to decide
according to candidates' qualifications, not birthplace. He also
said he was responding to GOP National Chairman Lee Atwater's
statement that the party wanted to elect a Cuban-American.
   Atwater charged Richman with misusing his remark. ``It was
unfortunate that something said over three months ago was taken
totally out of context and used divisively by the Richman
campaign,'' he said. ``I think they paid the price for it.''
   Atwater expressed delight at the GOP's latest Southern success;
the party picked up a seat held by a liberal Democrat for 27 years
and won its first congressional victory in Dade County.
   ``For us to win it is a major victory,'' Atwater said.
``(Democratic Chairman) Ron Brown was saying it was their seat, it
was the gateway to the South.''
   The GOP added to its unprecedented majority, now 11-8, in
Florida's House delegation.
   The campaign by Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, who is married to U.S. Attorney
Dexter Lehtinen, included appearances by President Bush and Vice
President Dan Quayle. Her campaign chairman was the president's son
Jeb.
   In Washington, anti-abortion activists claimed Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's
election proves that their movement is ``alive and well'' in the
wake of the Supreme Court's July 3 decision narrowing the right to
an abortion.
   During the campaign, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said she favored more
restrictions on abortion and Richman said he favored more choice.

<HEAD>Biden Proposes `Debt-for-Drugs' Incentives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., unveiled on
Wednesday ``debt-for-drugs'' legislation intended to offer
debt-relief incentives to Latin American nations that subsidize the
withdrawal of farm land from coca production.
   The legislation, to be introduced when Congress reconvenes next
week, is modeled on debt-for-nature exchanges already in place to
help protect tropical rain forests.
   Biden asserted in a statement that a U.S. investment of $400
million in a debt-for-drugs plan could free up enough funds to
subsidize the withdrawal of every acre in Bolivia, Columbia and Peru
now in coca production.
   Coca crops are refined to produce cocaine, one of the principal
illicit drugs on the U.S. narcotics market.
   Biden, who is to deliver the Democratic response to President
Bush's nationally televised adddress on drug policy next Tuesday
evening, said that for the immediate future the United States must
continue to extradite foreign drug traffickers for trial in U.S.
courts.
   ``But in the long run, the best way to cut coca production is to
provide economic incentives to grow other crops,' Biden said.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who returned this week from a 14-day
visit to nine Latin American countries, contends that substituting
other crops for coca will simply spread production of the enormously
profitable crop to other countries.
   Lugar said the best hope is an intensive campaign to reduce
narcotic consumption in the United States by discouraging first-time
and casual users and by rehabilitating addicts.
   Biden, however, said his plan can work in the countries involved
and has a ``realistic prospect of winning public support in this
country.''
   ``It is not a giveaway with no strings attached,'' he said.
``Americans love a good deal, and the debt-for-drugs plan is exactly
that.''
   Under the Biden legislation the United States, hopefully with the
help of U.S. allies, would create an international fund to negotiate
debt-for-drugs exchanges.
   The fund would purchase debt owed to foreign banks by the
governments of coca-producing nations.
   Once a sizeable amount of debt had been acquired the fund would
offer to forgive a coca-producing nation's interest on it for a year
in exchange for subsidies to shift farmers out of coca production.
   Once coca reduction targets were reached, the fund would forgive
the outstanding debt in full.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government kept secret the formula
it will unveil this week for a new administration, but it increased
security throughout Panama on Wednesday in anticipation of violent
demonstrations.
   Officials of the current administration have made clear that the
new government will be announced and will take office on Friday,
when the term of Acting President Manuel Solis expires.
   It will have the blessing of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who as
commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces is the power behind the
civilian administration. The Defense Forces include both soldiers
and police.
   Paramilitary groups organized into national defense committees
trained in different sites throughout the capital on Wednesday and
government agencies said they were placing themselves on a state of
alert.
   Opposition leaders said they planned no street protests against
the installation of a new government on Friday.
   ``If anything happens, it will be spontaneous,'' said former
opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara in an interview
Wednesday. ``Nothing special is going to happen on Friday. The
government will change some figures and will retain others.''
   Endara claims he won the May 7 elections, which were annulled by
the government.
   The opposition refused a government offer to form a national
reconciliation government. The government rejected opposition
demands that its victory be recognized and that Noriega step down.
   Government officials said all formulas were being considered in
the formation of the new government. However, sources, speaking on
the condition of anonymity, said it appeared the new government
would consist of a junta with civilian and military representatives.
   The governemnt scheduled a special Cabinet session for Thursday
morning.
   A special session of the Organization of American States will be
held in Washington on Thursday at the request of the U.S. government
after a Panamanian OAS delegate challenged the Bush administration
to present evidence of Noriega's alleged involvement in drug
trafficking.
   Noriega was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the
United States in February 1988.
   Noriega has commanded the Defense Forces since 1983 and is
considered the country's most powerful figure. He has become the
target of a U.S. campaign to remove him, and internally he is
accused by the political opposition of repression and violation of
human rights.
   Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter called the U.S. request for a
special OAS meeting an attempt ``to divert the continent's attention
away from what should be the main issue.''
   The focus of attention should be U.S. aggression, not Noriega, he
said.
   Noriega denies the drug trafficking charges and accuses the
United States of trying to oust him because of his nationalistic
policies.
   Opposition leaders said Wednesday that arrests announced by the
government were part of the ``propaganda and repression campaign of
the military.''
   Former vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon told
The Associated Press that 11 persons had been arrested, most of them
members of this Christian Democrat Party.

   Federal regulators announced Wednesday they
were selling five of the largest failed savings institutions under
their control, including a Texas thrift once owned by the former
owner of the Dallas Cowboys.
   David C. Cooke, director of the Resolution Trust Corp., the new
agency created earlier this month to dispose of bankrupt S&amp;Ls, said
the five, with assets totaling $10.8 billion, will be the first
major institutions returned to private ownership.
   They are:
   _Bright Banc Savings Association, Dallas, with $4 billion in
assets, formerly owned by H.R. ``Bum'' Bright, once one of the
nation's 50th wealthiest men and the former owner of the Dallas
Cowboys of the National Football League.
   _San Antonio Savings Association, San Antonio, with assets of
$2.5 billion.
   _Baltimore Federal Financial, Baltimore, with $1.6 billion in
assets. It was one of the first three S&amp;Ls seized by the government
on Feb. 7, the day after President Bush announced his S&amp;L proposal.
   _Broadview Federal Savings Bank, Independence, Ohio, with $1.6
billion in assets.
   _Skokie Federal Savings and Loan Association, Skokie, Ill., with
assets of $961 million.
   Together, the institutions serve 954,000 depositors. They are the
first transferred to the RTC's major transactions division, which
will begin meeting with potential buyers.
   Cooke said the institutions already have ``attracted considerable
investor interest nationwide.''
   Cooke's announcement came one day after his agency's overseers
cleared the RTC to get started on large, complex deals. The RTC is
run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the independent
regulatory agency, but the $50 billion in bailout spending
authorized in this month's S&amp;L bill is controlled by an
administration oversight panel headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
F. Brady.
   The regulators and the administration overseers had been
squabbling over the RTC's autonomy. Regulators had saidthey were
ready to get to work, but could not because the oversight board had
forbid the RTC from tackling any complex deals until the panel could
settle on policies governing the transactions.
   In a directive issued late Tuesday, the oversight board told the
RTC it could get started, but the panel said it must be consulted
before completion of transactions involving financing or loss
guarantees.
   Since it began operating on Aug. 9, the RTC has closed 11 small
S&amp;Ls, transferring their deposits to other institutions or paying
off customers directly.

   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
was preparing to present new drug charges against Panama at a
special meeting Thursday of the Organization of American States,
U.S. officials said.
   The 31-nation session was set at U.S. request after Panama last
week challenged the Bush administration for evidence of its charges
of drug involvement against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The 18-month unsuccessful U.S. campaign to oust Noriega as the
behind-the-scenes ruler in Panama is getting only lukewarm support
from the hemisphere group.
   The OAS foreign ministers last week adopted a bland statement
expressing concern about the situation in Panama. But the Bush
administration is hoping Eagleburger's response to the challenge
will put more zip in the OAS approach.
   Two Florida grand juries have already indicted Noriega on drug
smuggling charges. This week U.S. officials have hinted to reporters
there is more evidence against him.
   It is not clear how far Eagleburger will go in documenting U.S.
allegations since prosecutors would not want any court case
jeopardized.
   In requesting the meeting, William Price, the acting permanent
U.S. representative, said the United States wanted to present ``a
summary of the evidence and elaboration of the United States
position on the critical situation in Panama.''
   Noriega attorney Raymond Takiff of Miami demanded in a letter to
the OAS the right to cross-examine witnesses who were to appear
before the organization.
   The letter also asked for the ``opportunity to prove ... that the
indictments against General Noriega are motivated politically
representing nothing more than `indictment dipolomacy.'''
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, confirmed on
Wednesday that Eagleburger would focus on narcotics, but she
declined to offer any details in order ``not to pre-empt what the
Deputy Secretary will be saying tomorrow.''
   The term of Panama's provisional president, Manuel Solis Palma,
who was hand-picked by Noriega, expires on Thursday. The Bush
administration and Panamanian opponents of the general are concerned
Noriega will name a puppet government and not hold free elections.
   With tempers rising, Eagleburger last week compared Noriega to
Adolf Hitler and derided Panama as an ``outlaw regime'' that
deserves the censure of all OAS states.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter walked out, and in a
vitriolic 2-hour rebuttal, Panamanian delegate Romulo Escobar
Betancourt blamed the United States for lack of progress toward a
political solution.
   ``If you have any evidence to show Gen. Noriega is involved in
drug trafficking, bring it here to the OAS,'' Escobar said.
   In London, the British Foreign office on Wednesday urged Noriega
to step down and ``open the way to a peaceful, democratic resolution
of Panama's problems.''

   A woman who contends she killed her
lesbian lover because she was a victim of ``battered spouse
syndrome'' had been abused for years and feared for her life, her
lawyer said at her trial Wednesday.
   Annette Green, 30, was beaten and tormented for 11 years before
she fired a .38-caliber pistol into the head of Ivonne Julio, 32,
after a Halloween party last year, said defense attorney William
Lasley.
   Lasley hopes to introduce expert testimony at the murder trial to
prove she suffered from battered spouse syndrome and acted in
self-defense.
   Attorneys for both sides believe the trial is one of the first in
which the syndrome defense, usually employed in cases involving
long-term abusive heterosexual relationships, has been applied in
one involving a homosexual union.
   Ms. Green's love for Ms. Julio's teen-age twin daughters kept her
from ending the stormy relationship, Lasley said during a break in
the first day of testimony Wednesday.
   ``For 11 years, she was the mother of (Ms. Julio's) twins and
performed the domestic duties of the relationship,'' Lasley said.
``She was frequently battered and abused physically and
psychologically, along with the children.''
   Judge Thomas Waddell is expected to rule next week whether to
allow experts to testify about battered spouse syndrome.
   Assistant State Attorney Bob Johnson has said he'll challenge any
attempt to bring the syndrome into the case because, he said, there
is no research involving homosexual relationships.
   The prosecution maintains that Ms. Julio was killed while she was
in the closet of the mobile home the women shared. ``Ivonne Julio
was down on her knees in the closet begging for her life,'' Johnson
told jurors Tuesday.
   Jurors on Wednesday got a glimpse of the events that night in a
taped interview police had with Ms. Green hours after the shooting.
   The women, who had been drinking, had just returned from the
party when an argument erupted, and Ms. Julio pulled out her gun
from the closet, Ms. Green said on the tape.
   Ms. Green said she grabbed a knife that had been on a nightstand
because she thought Ms. Julio would kill her. ``I was afraid,'' she
said. ``There was a point I thought she was going to shoot me and I
just ran into her'' and grabbed the gun.
   Ms. Green said she didn't recall firing the weapon or what
happened to the knife, but admitted to the slaying.
   Ms. Green, who worked at a plant nursery last year, said the
relationship had been bad for a long time. ``It was driving me
nuts,'' she said.
   If convicted, Ms. Green could face life in prison.

<HEAD>Superpower Chemical Arms Accord Gets Final Approval</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officials in Washington and Moscow have approved a
draft U.S.-Soviet accord on how to conduct inspections of chemical
arms sites under a future comprehensive ban on the weapons, a U.S.
negotiator said Wednesday.
   Superpower negotiators in Geneva meanwhile completed a proposed
agreement on guidelines for the gradual destruction of chemical
weapons stockpiles and installations over a 10-year period, U.S.
envoy Max Friedersdorf said.
   Both issues are major parts of long-standing, 40-nation
negotiations in Geneva on a global convention banning production,
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.
   Friedersdorf said the U.S. side and the Soviets had not yet
agreed on how to carry out a proposed exchange of chemical arms data
between Washington and Moscow before a convention is ready.
   He commented after the latest 10-day round of periodic
U.S.-Soviet expert talks on chemical weapons.
   The paper approved in Washington and Moscow deals with procedures
for so-called challenge inspections in the United States and the
Soviet Union, the two countries with the biggest chemical arsenals.
   Under the proposed worldwide ban, challenge inspection will allow
any country to demand a short-notice, spot probe by international
experts of any suspected chemical weapons site.
   Points covered in the U.S.-Soviet accord include how to trigger
inspections and how to deal with their findings, Friedersdorf said
in an interview in the U.S. mission's daily newsletter.

<TEXT>
   A woman who dialed 911 to report her estranged
husband was on his way to kill her was told to call back if he
arrived. Fifteen minutes later the woman and three others were shot
to death at a birthday party.
   Maria Delia Navarro was slain Sunday after being warned by a
brother-in-law that her husband was going to shoot up her 27th
birthday party, authorities said.
   Sheriff Sherman Block defended the 911 dispatcher's actions
Wednesday.
   ``The dispatcher did, in fact, function properly,'' Block said a
news conference. ``She did not violate any department policies or
procedures.''
   ``It is one of those tragic situations. We all wish it would have
turned out another way. But this deputy sheriff did not act
improperly.''
   Last January, Mrs. Navarro obtained a restraining order barring
Raymond Navarro Jr. from going within 100 yards of her residence.
Block said there was a history of violence between Mrs. Navarro and
her husband.
   On Sunday, Mrs. Navarro was warned by a brother of Navarro that
her husband was coming with a gun, police said.
   She dialed 911, told the dispatcher of the restraining order and
said she believed Navarro would carry out his threat of violence.
   According to a transcript, this exchange that followed:
   Deputy: ``He hasn't come over there?''
   Navarro: ``No, he hasn't.''
   Deputy: ``But he's just threatening to do so?''
   Navarro: ``Yes, and I'm sure he will.''
   Deputy: ``Ok, well, the only thing to do is just call us if he
comes over there. ... I mean, what can we do? We can't have a unit
sent there and wait and see if he comes over.''
   About 15 minutes later, Navarro burst into the converted garage
Mrs. Navarro was renting and began firing a handgun, police said.
   Navarro, 26, was charged Tuesday with four counts of murder and
two of attempted murder, and prosecutors specified circumstances
that would make him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. He
was jailed without bail.
   In addition to the four dead women, two people were critically
wounded.
   The sheriff expressed sympathy to the victims' families but said
the information given in the 911 call did not warrant an immediate
response by a patrol car.
   ``There are threats made all the time,'' he said. ``There is a
difference between a threat and a clear and present danger.''
   Block said the killings would not lead to any change in
department policies. ``911 is designed primarily to deal with an
existent emergency,'' he said, ``and it does that very well.''
   Block said 700,000 calls are received on 911 every year, a
quarter of them prank calls. About 50,000 calls come to the station
that handled Mrs. Navarro's call, and each requires a judgment call
by the dispatcher, he said.
   A head of a program for battered women criticized the 911 policy.
   ``Unless the danger is imminent, law enforcement doesn't give it
a high priority,'' said Betty Fisher, program director at Haven
Hills Family Violence Center of San Fernando Valley. ``The criteria
for determining imminent danger should be examined.''

   WASHINGoutraged
minority groups on Wednesday by considering a watered-down version
of a plan to make their native tongue the official language of the
ethnically diverse republic.
   Moldavian leaders, reportedly at the urging of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, were leaning toward adopting the compromise to
try to stop strikes by Russians and other groups opposed to the
pending language law.
   Non-Moldavians are reported to be on strike at 200 businesses and
industries in the tiny southern republic bordering Romania. The
official Tass news agency said rail workers in several cities
Wednesday joined the walkouts.
   The initial proposal would make only Moldavian the official
language of the republic. The compromise plan would make Moldavian
the language of government officials and documents, and Russian
would be the language for everyday contacts between the republic's
ethnic groups.

   Leaders of Moldavia tried to placate outraged
minorities Wednesday by considering a watered-down version of
legislation to make Moldavian the official language in the
ethnically diverse southern republic.
   At the urging of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, reports said,
the Moldavians were leaning toward the compromise in an effort to
stop strikes by ethnic Russians and others opposed to the pending
language law.
   Non-Moldavians were reported on strike at 200 businesses and
industries in the small republic next to Romania. The official news
agency Tass said rail workers in several cities joined the walkout
Wednesday.
   Under the original proposal, Moldavian would be the only official
language. The compromise would make it the language of officials and
documents, but Russian would be the everyday tongue for contact
among ethnic groups.
   In the restive Baltic republics, the Latvian Communist Party
indicated willingness Wednesday to accept competing political
parties, activists reported. Gorbachev has repeatedly voiced
opposition to multiple political parties.
   Ianis Krummins, deputy editor of Atmoda, the Latvian People's
Front newspaper, said the Central Committee expressed support for
eliminating a clause in the republic's constitution that defines the
Communist Party as the leading force of society and the political
system.
   Krummins said he listened to a live radio broadcast of the
Central Committee meeting in Riga, the Latvian capital.
   The clause is virtually identical to one in the Soviet
constitution that has put an effective ban on alternative parties
for 70 years, Krummins said.
   Several small political parties have cropped in recent months,
most of them in Latvia and the other two Baltic republics, Lithuania
and Estonia.
   Moldavia's Communist Party chief, Semen Grossu, suggested the
language compromise to the legislature Wednesday after speaking with
Gorbachev on the telephone, Tass said.
   Grossu did not say whether Gorbachev suggested the compromise
although, but that is widely believed to be the case, Vasily Nestase
of the pro-Moldavian People's Front said by telephone from the
republic's capital, Kishinev.
   Moldavia now has no language law. Russian traditionally has been
the tongue for government affairs and is commonly used in commerce,
which upsets native Moldavians.
   The compromise would cut a part of the bill that would have made
Moldavian the language of communication among Russians, Ukrainians,
Jews, Bulgarians, and other ethnic groups in the republic.
   The initial law goes farther than the language laws in a number
of other republics. Many non-Moldavians do not speak Moldavian, but
they share some knowledge of Russian as a result of Soviet schooling.
   Grossu suggested adding a line in the Moldavian constitution that
would specify using Russian as the ``language of inter-ethnic
communication,'' Tass reported.
   People's Front activists who are backing the language law said
they were inclined to accept Grossu's suggestion.
   ``We think this is the most realistic compromise,'' said Nataly
Pascal of the People's Front in a telephone interview. ``We support
this compromise and we're not the only ones.''
   The Moldavian Supreme Soviet began debating the proposed law
Tuesday, and Nestase said the session would continue Thursday.
   Gorbachev has quietly been involved in several attempts recently
to quell unrest that has surfaced in many of the ethnically diverse
Soviet republics, some of which retain strong nationalist identities.
   He told the Lithuanian party chief during the weekend that the
independence movement in that former nation had gone too far.
   Gorbachev also ``worked out'' with other members of the ruling
Politburo a tough party statement Saturday condemning nationalism,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Tuesday. The
statement by the policy-making Central Committee warned that
independence movements were leading the country into an ``abyss.''
   A strike organizer in the Moldavian city of Tiraspol, where
Russians and other minorities walked off their jobs last week to
protest the proposed language law, said strikers were willing to
consider the compromise even though they would still prefer that
Russian and Moldavian be given equal status.
   The weekly Moscow News on Wednesday said unemployment as a factor
in the republic's unrest. It said at least 150,000 of the republic's
4.2 million people are without jobs, and the number is growing.
   Pravda repeated earlier criticism of People's Front activists,
accusing them of ``spreading the seeds of separatism and
nationalism'' and claiming that Moldavian parliamentarians ordered
the Pravda correspondent to leave the republic.
   The proposed language law also would restore the Latin alphabet,
replacing the Cyrillic alphabet imposed by dictator Josef Stalin
after he annexed Moldavia from Romania in 1940. Stalin imposed
Cyrillic, which is used in Russian, to back his claim that Romanians
and Moldavians are two distinct nationalities.
   Ethnic Moldavians make up 64 percent of the republic's
population. Tensions between the Moldavians and non-Moldavians have
been running high since the People's Front began organizing early
this year to push the language law and other demands to give them
more autonomy from Moscow.

<HEAD>Swindall Says Father Abused Him and Siblings; Father Denies It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Pat Swindall, sentenced to prison this
week for lying to a federal grand jury, says he didn't take the
stand at his perjury trial for fear of revealing he and his siblings
were abused by their father.
   Swindall's father denied the allegations, and a prosecutor said
the former congressman was suffering from ``a severe case of Monday
morning quarterbacking.''
   Swindall told reporters Tuesday that he and his siblings were all
abused by their father, Nathan Swindall.
   He said he and his brothers, Kevin and Philip, and his sister,
Theresa, discussed the matter and agreed he should come forward.
   He gave no details of his alleged abuse.
   The 38-year-old Republican who represented Atlanta's eastern
suburbs in Congress for two terms until his defeat in 1988 was
sentenced Monday to a year in prison and fined $30,000 on nine
counts of perjury. He is free on appeal.
   Swindall was convicted June 20 of lying to a grand jury in 1988
about negotiations for an $850,000 loan from a federal agent posing
as a drug-money launderer.
   The loan to help finance his $1.5 million Stone Mountain home was
never completed. Swindall was convicted of perjury for denying he
was told the loan might contain drug profits. He later said he was
tired and his memory faulty.
   ``My father's a very sick man,'' Swindall said Tuesday. ``You can
go back to 1966 at Emory University Hospital. You will find that my
sister was admitted in June of 1966 with hysterical paralysis.''
   Emory spokeswoman Judy Smith said Wednesday the hospital would
not release information on Theresa Swindall. ``If she's got her own
medical records, she can do it for herself, but we certainly
wouldn't do that,'' she said.
   Swindall also said he and his brother David were admitted to the
hospital for ulcers that same summer.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said he did not believe the allegations
would have been raised at trial by the prosecution.
   ``As far as I can tell this has nothing to do with his case; he's
having a severe case of Monday morning quarterbacking,'' Barr said.
``There was nothing in evidence relating to this and, I don't
believe, in any pretrial evidence.''
   Swindall provided reporters with a copy of a 1987 deposition by
his father concerning a dispute over a loan for a family business.
But he said he had removed a number of pages that referred to
allegations of abuse.
   Swindall's sister said in an interview with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution that her father had sexually abused her as a
teen-ager but that her siblings had agreed not to discuss the matter
publicly until now.
   Swindall's father, Nathan, denied abusing his daughter. ``When
anybody accuses me of incest he better be proving it. I deny that
completely,'' he said.
   ``It's strange this wouldn't come out until there's money
involved,'' Nathan Swindall said. ``I don't know how much he paid
his sister to say these things.''

   Showers and thunderstorms that developed in warm, moist air ahead
of a cold front were scattered across the Southeast on Wednesday,
with locally heavy rain.
   Showers and thunderstorms were most numerous from the Gulf Coast
to the Tennessee Valley, and across southern Missouri, southern
Kansas and northern Oklahoma.
   Heavier rainfall for the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included 1.87
inches at Miami and 0.97 of an inch at Crossville, Tenn.
   An extension of the cold front also produced showers and
thunderstorms over western Maine and northern New Hampshire.
   Elsewhere, showers and a few thunderstorms developed over New
Mexico, southern Minnesota and the northern Rocky Mountains.
   Temperatures warmed into the 90s across much of the southern
Plains and parts of the Southeast, but were only in the 60s from
Upper Michigan through eastern North Dakota to northern Montana and
in the 50s and 60s over much of the Northwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., to 102 at Blythe and Needles, Calif.
Wednesday morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 34 at Gunnison,
Colo.
   For Thursday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from Florida and the central Gulf Coast region to the upper Great
Lakes and the upper Mississippi Valley, and across the northern half
of the Great Plains region and the northern half of the Rocky
Mountains. Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
over Arizona.
   Highs in the 60s were predicted from northern Montana to northern
Washington state; in the 70s from the rest of the northern Pacific
Coast to North Dakota, and from Minnesota through the Great Lakes to
northern New England, and along the coast of California; in the 90s
from the southern and central Plains to the southern Atlantic Coast,
and from southern New Mexico to the southern and central valleys of
California, and above 100 in the desert Southwest.

   President Bush, who hasn't had any
luck fishing on his summer vacation, jokingly asked a newspaper
Wednesday to stop running a ``no-fish'' logo chronicling his
rod-and-reel failures.
   The Portland Press Herald's graphic consists of a circle with a
line drawn through a bluefish, similar to the ``Ghostbusters'' logo.
   Bush, whose hook has come up empty for 13 days in a row, said he
planned to call the newspaper's editor.
   ``I think they should knock off that advertisement,'' he said
during a presentation by the Chamber of Commerce for this seaside
resort and neighboring Kennebunk.
   Bush pointed out that someone else on his boat had caught a fish.
   But Press Herald Executive Editor John K. Murphy said that wasn't
going to be enough to stop the graphic, which the paper plans to
keep running as long as Bush's luck stays poor.
   ``I think the president's suggestion that we credit any fish
caught on his boat sounds fishy,'' Murphy said. ``We are eagerly
awaiting his first catch of his vacation.''
   Bush has until Tuesday, when he plans to head back to Washington,
to catch a fish.

   The bears are back. Just ask Betty Klasnya.
   ``I was sitting on my back steps, going through a bag of seeds
for planting, when I felt something was out there looking at me,''
said Klasnya.
   The ``something'' was a 200-pound black bear in her back yard
relishing the aroma of pork chops frying on the stove.
   She ran inside, replaced the pork chops with garlic and onions to
encourage the bear's departure, clapped her hands and made a fuss
until the animal sauntered back into the woods.
   ``I'm not going to fry pork chops or bacon till the bear season
is over,'' she said.
   Since last week's encounter, police have received more than 20
reports of bear sightings around this Lake Superior city.
   The bears are in town for their late-summer gorging in greater
numbers than in the last two years.
   The influx, however, doesn't come close to the invasion of 1985,
when dozens of bears, searching for food here because of poor berry
and nut supplies in the woods, were sighted some days.
   A poor crop of hazelnuts, one of bears' favorite foods, and an
increased bear population, is forcing bears to move as far south as
Duluth, experts say.
   Researcher Lynn Rogers said bears that come to Duluth looking for
a meal feed on clover, apples _ and garbage.

<HEAD>United Nations Says West Germany, Japan Increased Trade With South
Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan, Taiwan and West Germany expanded
their imports and exports with South Africa to fill the trade gap as
South Africa's economy faced anti-apartheid sanctions in the
mid-1980s, a U.N. report said Wednesday.
   A major outbreak of black unrest in South Africa in 1984 was a
pivotal event in that nation's financial affairs, prompting many
U.S. banks and corporations to dissolve their investments in South
Africa.
   In 1985, New York City passed an ordinance specifying that banks
providing city services could not extend new loans to Pretoria.
   But a report by the U.N. Commission on Transnational
Corporations, released Wednesday, said that ``although a number of
countries have reduced their trade with South Africa, there is
evidence that other corporations have filled some of this gap.''
   It said Japan increased its imports from South Africa by $455
million in 1987, compared with the average annual level of imports
from 1983-85.
   In the same period, Taiwan's imports increased by $242 million,
Turkey's by $268 million, and West German imports increased $187
million.
   U.S. imports dropped $557 million in 1987, Danish imports fell
$92 million and British imports were off by $91 million.
   West Germany increased its exports to South Africa by $357
million in 1987, compared with the annual average in 1983-85, the
report said. Taiwan's exports were up $171 million, and Japanese
exports rose by $130 million.
   At the same time, U.S. exports to South Africa fell by $349
million, it said.
   The report concluded, ``International pressures may be applied
through foreign trade, disinvestment, and foreign finance.''
   ``Disinvestment is perhaps the area with the least significant
immediate impact,'' partly because most disinvesting companies sell
off their plants or create other non-equity relationships.
   ``These relationships allow for transfers of technology to the
South African economy which are essential to the functioning of that
economy,'' the U.N. report noted.
   It said the electronics and automotive industries in South Africa
particularly benefited from technology transfer through ``equity
links, licensing, trade, purchase of know-how and through the flow
of human resources.''
   The report cited a news release from Ford after its disinvestment
from South Africa as an example of the irrelevance of equity
relationships to the transfer of vital technology.
   Ford passed along its equity in SAMCOR, the South African local
Ford plant, to the local work force.
   The U.N. report quotes Ford as saying afterward, ``Ford will
continue to provide SAMCOR with necessary components, licensed use
of the Ford trademark and management and technical assistance as
needed.''

   An international conference on Cambodia could not
produce an agreement and suspended its work Wednesday until warring
factions are ready for a compromise to end a generation of violence.
   ``We need time so the spirit of reconciliation can overcome the
spirit of confrontation, but for Cambodia the hour of peace will
come,'' Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, told the
delegates just before adjourning the final session.
   Some delegates said the failure increased the likelihood of
full-scale civil war when Vietnam withdraws its military forces
Sept. 27 after nearly 11 years of occupation.
   Last-minute negotiations delayed a final statement by seven
hours. It fell far short of the comprehensive settlement delegates
from 19 nations hoped to achieve when the conference opened in late
July.
   The statement said the meeting ``achieved progress in elaborating
a wide variety of elements necessary for the reaching of a
comprehensive settlement to the tragic conflict in Cambodia,'' but
added: ``It is not yet possible to achieve a comprehensive
settlement. It was therefore decided to suspend the conference.''
   France and Indonesia offered to help mediate between the
Vietnam-sponsored government of Premier Hun Sen and the
three-faction rebel alliance led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who
ruled Cambodia until a coup in 1970.
   ``We will come back to Paris,'' Sihanouk said as he left the
conference hall. ``The problem is complicated. We must be patient.''
   Dumas told reporters the work of a fact-finding commission sent
to Cambodia and other groundwork by the conference may pay off when
the parties are ready to compromise.
   Ali Alatas, foreign minister of Indonesia, said: ``There have
been too many casualties, too much suffering, too much bitterness.
... The very fact that we can sit down together, I think this was
quite a feat.''
   Delegates left open the possiblity of using committees set up
under conference auspices for future talks between the belligerents.
   According to the final statement, France and Indonesia ``will
begin consultations within six months with the participants in the
conference with a view to reconvening the conference.''
   France called the meeting when a climate of greater cooperation
appeared to make settlement possible, but positions of the Cambodian
factions hardened during three weeks of negotiations in small
working groups.
   Dumas said negotiations broke down on five points, including
composition of a transitional government, how to monitor the
withdrawal and use of the word ``genocide'' in describing Khmer
Rouge rule from April 1975 until Vietnam invaded in December 1978.
   An estimated 1 million Cambodians died under the Khmer Rouge,
which now is the strongest of the three rebel factions.
   Hun Sen told reporters: ``We know it is the Khmer Rouge who have
ruined the outcome of this conference, who have scuttled it.''
   He said the conduct of the Khmer Rouge and its allies suggested
they were preparing for civil war and ``it confirms and presages new
massacres of millions of Cambodians.''
   The Bush administration blamed Vietnam and Cambodia for the
collapse of the peace conference, and reiterated reluctant support
for a Khmer Rouge role in a transitional government.
   Margaret Tutwiler, a State Department spokeswoman in Washington,
said ``it was not possible to achieve a lasting settlement due to
the failure of the Vietnamese and Hun Sen regime to negotiate
constructively on key issues.''
   At the same time, she said ``progress was made toward the
important goal of a free and independent Cambodia. Any progress is
welcome and we should build upon it.''
   Tommy Koh, spokesman for the Singapore delegation, said: ``It
will be like Afghanistan'' after the Vietnamese withdraw. ``There
will be more fighting. The two sides are preparing for war; they're
already fighting.''
   Intransigence that marked the meeting throughout held up the
final session, which was scheduled to begin in the morning but was
delayed until late afternoon.
   Points of disagreement included an item in a draft of the final
statement calling for the Cambodian parties to intensify ``efforts
to achieve national reconciliation.''
   Both China, which supports the Khmer Rouge, and Sihanouk objected
to the reference to national reconciliation and it was deleted.
   Their position remains that the government led by Hun Sen is
merely a Vietnamese puppet.
   Sihanouk said the resistance would reject any international
monitoring of the withdrawal ``before the dismantling of the illegal
regime of Phnom Penh and its replacement by a Cambodian provisional
quadrapartite government'' of the three resistance groups and Hun
Sen.

   City investigators appear ready to conclude
that Mayor Tom Bradley could face civil fines but committed no
crimes when he was paid by banks doing business with the city,
newspapers reported Wednesday.
   The Los Angeles Times and Los Angeles Herald Examiner quoted
unidentified sources as saying the report from City Attorney James
Hahn is due in two weeks.
   But the sources also cautioned that new information could change
the recommendations.
   Bradley still faces an investigation by the U.S. Justice
Department into his finances.
   Hahn plans to recommend the city sue the mayor to collect about
$200,000 in fines for financial reporting violations, the newspapers
said. Such fines are subject to negotiation.
   ``The mayor has said ... he will answer questions once the report
is distributed,'' Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said Wednesday.
``He will still wait for the final report.''
   A spokesman for the City Attorney's office declined comment.
   The mayor, a former city policeman and councilman, won an
unprecedented fifth term April 11.
   Federal investigators are analyzing Bradley's many investments
with Drexel Burnham Lambert and Michael Milken, the former junk bond
king who recently resigned from the investment firm after he was
indicted on fraud charges.
   Hahn's inquiry focuses on the 71-year-old mayor's connection to
Far East National Bank. The bank paid Bradley $18,000 for consulting.
   After some inquiries by Bradley, City Treasurer Leonard
Rittenberg subsequently had $2 million in city funds deposited with
the bank. Both Bradley and Rittenberg deny pressure was applied to
make the deposit.
   Bradley returned the $18,000 consulting fee after allegations of
favoritism surfaced.
   The city attorney is also looking into whether Bradley violated
conflict-of-interest laws by accepting payments from a savings and
loan association, and is examining more than 100 errors in the
mayor's disclosures regarding his extensive stock portfolio and
property holdings.
   Sources also said Hahn's report will not make any recommendations
related to Juanita St. John, who is being investigated for failure
to account for $180,000 in city funds allocated to the Task Force
for Africa-Los Angeles Relations.

   The Security Council adopted a resolution
Wednesday deploring Israel's deportation of Arabs suspected of
organizing the Palestinian uprising, the strongest action it has
taken yet on the deportation issue.
   The United States refused to use its veto power to protect
Israel, and abstained. The resolution passed 14-0.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, a former ambassador to
Israel, said deportations are unhelpful and provoke Arab-Israeli
tension in the region.
   ``The United States continues to feel very strongly about
deportations,'' Pickering said after leaving the council chamber.
   ``It's a view that we've expressed many times to the government
of Israel and it's a view that we expressed in our statement today
when we abstained on the vote.''
   On Sunday, Israel deported five Arabs from the West Bank, sending
four to Lebanon and one to France.
   In July, the council passed a similar resolution using milder
language, saying it ``deeply regrets'' such expulsions. That
resolution also passed 14-0, with America abstaining.
   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein said ``wordings are not
important. What is important is that at a time when carnage is going
on in Lebanon and murders are going on in the (occupied) territories
... the Security Council meets here for this nonsense and is very
quick to act.''
   He added that ``what is disturbing is that it looks like the
United States is giving in.''
   Wednesday's resolution ``deplores the continuing deportation by
Israel, the occupying power, of Palestinian civilians.'' It asks
Israel to return those expelled and halt the policy.
   It also asks Israel to abide by the Geneva Convention that
protects the rights of civilians in zones under military occupation.
   Bein castigated the Palestine Liberation Organization for
instigating the 20-month-old insurrection. He said Israel is the
focus of one-sided Security Council criticism.
   Palestinians on Dec. 8, 1987, began their uprising against
Israeli rule in lands occupied in the 1967 Middle East war, often
stoning soldiers and Israeli settlers. At least 554 Palestinians
have been killed in clashes with soldiers or Israeli civilians since
then. Thirty-eight Israelis also have been killed.

<HEAD>Report Says British Mercenaries Tried To Kill Drug Lord</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Colombia Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British television station reported Wednesday
that 11 British mercenaries were involved in an unsuccessful attempt
in June to kill Pablo Escobar Gaviria, a reputed Colombian cocaine
baron.
   Independent Television News said the men were hired by a rival
drug gang it did not name to kill Escobar, said to be a leader of
the Medellin cartel.
   It showed film of men in camouflage gear in helicopters and in a
jungle, and said the ``exclusive'' footage depicted rehearsals for
the June 4 assassination attempt. Independent Television News said
it understood one of the mercenaries made the film.
   The attempt failed when one of two helicopters crashed while
flying low over the Escobar estate, killing the pilot, according to
the report.
   It said the British mercenaries had intended to drop explosives
on Escobar's house, land and kill everyone in the area. The report
said all the mercenaries survived the crash, implying the pilot was
Colombian.
   Turning to the United States, it said President Bush was
concerned and ``the activities of British mercenaries in Colombia
has been high on his Cabinet's agenda. They want them investigated
by the British government.''
   A Foreign Office spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said: ``While
we are in touch with the Americans about this drug problem, there
has been no specific request for an investigation of this kind.''
   On Tuesday, the State Department said it had asked the British
government to investigate allegations that Britons helped train
teams of assassins for Colombian drug traffickers. The traffickers
have blamed for the assassination of a leading Colombian
presidential candidate on Aug. 18, which prompted an unprecedented
government crackdown on the drug lords.
   George Foulkes, a spokesman for Britain's opposition Labor Party,
said the government should prosecute the mercenaries and cancel
their passports. ``It's illegal for British citizens to take up arms
against a friendly country and Colombia is friendly,'' he told
Independent Television News.

   Mourners packed a church and the street outside
Wednesday to remember a black teen-ager killed last week by a white
gang, cheering as the Rev. Louis Farrakhan and others demanded an
end to racial violence.
   ``We say, as the Jews say, `Never again. Never again. Never
again,''' the Black Muslim leader said to cheers and applause from
more than 300 people attending Yusef Hawkins' funeral at Glover
Memorial Baptist Church.
   About 1,000 people stood outside singing hymns and listening to
eulogies for Hawkins, 16, who was shot to death in the predominantly
white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst a week ago.
   The service began an hour after two white Brooklyn youths,
including one identified as the gang's leader, were charged with
murder. Both remained free on bail.
   Police continued hunting for an 18-year-old man believed to be
the triggerman.
   ``As long as white children can get away with killing black
children, and white law enforcement does not know how to make
examples of its own ... then justice is far off,'' Farrakhan said.
   While none of the speakers advocated violence, the Rev. Al
Sharpton indicated the time for a passive response to such incidents
had passed.
   ``We're not going to let you down. They're going to pay this
time, Yusef,'' said Sharpton. ``It's time for us to change our ways.
We can run a man for the White House, but we can't walk a child
through Bensonhurst.''
   Hawkins' slaying triggered a racial furor in New York unseen
since a black man died fleeing a white mob in the Howard Beach
section of Queens.
   ``Let freedom ring from Howard Beach, Mr. Mayor,'' the Rev.
Curtis Wells, pastor of the church and a cousin of the victim, said,
addressing Mayor Edward I. Koch. ``Let freedom ring from
Bensonhurst. We're not going to take it anymore. We're going to walk
where we want to walk.''
   Hawkins and three friends were answering an ad for a used car
when up to 30 whites carrying bats, golf clubs and at least one gun,
confronted them and killed him, authorities said.
   Koch and Gov. Mario Cuomo, both Democrats, and Republican mayoral
hopeful Rudolph Giuliani were heckled outside the church. The mayor
left through a side door.
   Democratic mayoral candidates Harrison J. Goldin and David
Dinkins also attended the funeral. Dinkins, who is black, was
welcomed as he entered the church.
   Spike Lee, the director and star of the racial-issue film ``Do
The Right Thing,'' sat near Hawkins' parents.
   Some mourners distributed fliers calling for a demonstration
Thursday to protest Hawkins' slaying.
   Earlier, a grand jury charged Keith Mondello, 18, and Pasquale
Raucci, 19, with second-degree murder and Raucci with manslaughter.
Bboth were charged with first-degree assault, riot, criminal
possession of a deadly weapon, civil-rights violations, aggravated
harassment, menacing and unlawful imprisonment.
   Mondello was the gang's alleged leader. Four others were charged
in the attack.

<HEAD>NRC Approves Stainless-Steel Waste Transport Container</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than a decade of research and
development culminated Wednesday in federal approval of a steel
container to hold plutonium-contaminated trash during shipment to a
repository in New Mexico.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved TRUPACT-2, which the
Energy Department will use to haul waste to its Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant, a desert repository carved out of salt beds 2,150 feet
below the surface of the Earth.
   TRUPACT-2 _ a cylindrical, stainless-steel vault-within-a-vault
with 10 inches of polyurethane cushioning in between _ was designed
and tested by the Energy Department. It is manufactured by Nuclear
Packaging Inc. of Federal Way, Wash.
   ``This certainly is one of the critical milestones to opening the
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant,'' said Jim Tollison, Energy Department
manager of waste transportation for the plant, 26 miles southeast of
Carlsbad.
   Tollison said the 10-foot containers will cost about $200,000
each and the trailers to haul them about $20,000 apiece.
   Robert Neill, director of the Environmental Evaluation Group, a
federally funded state watchdog agency, said of the NRC's approval,
``We're real pleased it passed muster.''
   But Don Hancock, director of the Southwest Research and
Information Center's nuclear waste safety project, said the product
was not adequately evaluated. The organization is a private,
non-profit watchdog group.
   A longer evaulation ``would have included the NRC reviewing the
quality assurance program,'' said Hancock.
   Tollison said the NRC had been reviewing the container program,
which had its birth in the late 1970s, since 1987.
   TRUPACT stands for Transuranic Packaging Transporter. Transuranic
wastes are those contaminated with radioactive elements heavier than
uranium. The waste includes such things as gloves and tools.
   Each TRUPACT-2 container will hold up to 14 55-gallon drums of
radioactive waste generated by the nation's weapons plants. The
TRUPACT-2 containers will be carried three at a time aboard special
trailers to WIPP.
   The NRC said in a statement that the government expects to ship
600 truckloads to WIPP each year for 25 years, with the trucks
watched by satellite.
   The desert repository has been built, but its 1988 opening was
postponed because of concerns about its safety, delays in getting
the land around the site withdrawn from public use and lack of
certification for the TRUPACT.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins has said the site won't open until
he is sure all the technical concerns are resolved.

<HEAD>Ethical Rules Say Parent Can Donate Liver to Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors at the University of Chicago have proposed
that transplants in which only a piece of the liver is taken from a
living donor be limited in most cases to parents supplying organs to
their children.
   The idea, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, was offered for discussion in hopes the medical profession
eventually will adopt such ethical guidelines.
   Doctors at the University of Chicago drew up the rules before
attempting their first transplant of a section of liver from a
living donor.
   Transplants involving whole or partial livers taken from the dead
are routine in many places. But because these organs are in scarce,
some doctors would like to begin transplanting parts of organs taken
from the living.
   Because the body has only one liver, the organ cannot be entirely
removed for transplant.
   The new surgery would remove one lobe of a healthy person's liver
and transplant it into an infant. The missing part of the donor's
liver eventually grows back, and in the baby, the piece of organ
grows along with the child.
   ``We believe that from the perspectives of both recipient and
donor, the benefits outweigh the risks and that it is ethically
appropriate to proceed with a trial of liver transplantation using a
parent as a living donor,'' wrote Dr. Peter A. Singer and colleagues.
   The guidelines resulted from a year-long series of seminars and
discussions.
   The doctors proposed that the donor should be the child's parent
or, in rare cases, a mature sibling or grandparent.
   They said that when the donor is related to the recipient, the
benefits of saving a life are most rewarding. Such transplants also
have the best chance of succeeding.
   A team led by Dr. Christoph Broelsch of the University of Chicago
surgeons hopes to perform the first such operation in the United
States this fall. The operation has already been done in Brazil.
   Doctors say that because of the shortage of organs from cadavers,
up to half of all babies who need new livers die while awaiting
transplants.

   The Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a stay of
execution for Alton Waye, scheduled to become the eighth person to
die in Virginia's electric chair since the state reinstituted the
death penalty in 1977.
   By a 7-2 vote, the court rejected emergency requests to postpone
the electrocution, scheduled for 11 p.m. By the same margin, the
court refused Waye's request to have his case formally studied by
the justices.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose the
death penalty under all circumstances, voted to spare Waye.
   Earlier, Gov. Gerald L. Baliles denied clemency for Waye,
convicted of the 1977 rape and murder of a 61-year-old widow.

   Leftist guerrillas on Wednesday killed a

state, RCN radio network reported.
   The body of rancher Libardo Gutierez Marquez was found in the

told the station.
   The victim, brother of a former attorney general, was kidnapped
by an armed group identified as a command of the Popular Liberation

   The group, one of many guerrilla organizations operating in
Colombia, is believed to follow the teachings of China's late leader
Mao Tse-tung.
   The Popular Liberation Army usually demands ransom for its kidnap
victims.
   Police officials also reported finding a common grave containing
12 bodies in Sucre, another northeastern state. One body was of a
veterinarian kidnapped by bandits months ago, they said. Police did
not say what day the grave was discovered.

<HEAD>Fewer Fires in Amazon This Year But Damage Still Extensive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of fires set in the
Amazon rain forest has dropped from last year but the region is
still suffering extensive damage, government scientists said
Wednesday.
   They say the burning increases the amount of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere and adds to the greenhouse effect, which causes a
global warming.
   Marcos Pereira, a researcher at the Space Studies Institute, said
experts in the past two months detected 59,000 fires that devastated
12,700 square miles of forest _ an area larger than Maryland.
   That represents roughly 1.5 percent of the so-called legal
Amazon, a 2 million-square-mile region.
   ``We're certainly going to have fewer fires and less destruction
in 1989 than in 1988, primarily because we've had unusually heavy
rains this year,'' Pereira told The Associated Press by telephone
from Sao Jose dos Campos, 210 miles southwest of Rio.
   In 1988, about 45,600 square miles were destroyed by 205,000
fires, Pereira said.
   The institute monitors fires in the Amazon by using satellites
that detect smoke and heat.
   Pereira said the government helped reduce the number of fires,
mainly by suspending incentives for large-scale agricultural and
ranching projects.
   It also began a plan this month to monitor part of the region by
helicopter and fine those found guilty of clearing the forest
illegally.
   Officials handed out $9 million in fines in the first 15 days.
   ``There's a greater awareness of the problem, on the part of the
government and individuals, and that will make it easier to protect
the Amazon,'' Pereira said.
   Ranchers and farmers burn off large tracts of the rain forest to
clear land for planting and grazing.

<TEXT>
   Officials are preparing for a new wave
of East German refugees seeking to flee to the West from Hungary,
but denied on Wednesday that a deal was struck to permit a wholesale
exodus.
   Preparations went ahead to set up four tent camps in Bavaria
state to house an expected surge of East German refugees after Sept.
1.
   West German and Hungarian officials say many East German families
will have to decide whether to flee to the West or return home by
then because it marks the end of the school vacation in East Germany.
   The Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspaper said Austrian and West
German rail officials worked out plans for special trains to bring
refugees to West Germany.
   Chief government spokesman Hans Klein said the new refugee
facilities are being erected ``because the government must be
prepared for all possibilities. We have to take this date of Sept. 1
and the days thereafter seriously.''
   West German TV quoted Hungarian Interior Minister Istvan Horvath
as reiterating Hungary's intention not to return any East Germans
against their will and again appealing to Bonn and East Berlin to
work to solve the problem.
   Klein said officials estimate that from 150,000 to 200,000 East
Germans are on vacation in Hungary. Officials earlier speculated as
many as 20,000 could decide to stay in Hungary.
   West German news media reported that 15,000 East Germans would be
allowed to go the West from Hungary by the weekend, carrying newly
issued West German passports.
   A high-ranking government official in Bonn, speaking on condition
of anonymity, denied it and said issuing such passports would not
solve the problem.
   ``The new passports do not have a Hungarian entry visa in them
and thus could not be used to legally leave the country,'' he said.
   Klein said news reports saying that removal of the visa
requirement was imminent ``do not correspond to the facts and
possibilities.''
   In Vienna, an Austrian government source said the International
Red Cross is working on a plan to ferry at least 1,500 East Germans
from Hungary via Austria to West Germany in the next few days.
   West German officials said negotiations were continuing, but no
final arrangement had been concluded.
   At least 6,000 East Germans are thought to have used vacations in
Hungary to flee west to Austria since Budapest began dismantling
fortifications along the border in May.
   The flood of refugees has been fueled by the refusal of the
communist East German leadership to adopt economic and political
reforms similar to those under way in Poland and Hungary.

   Elliot L. Richardson, a former U.S.
attorney general with a long record of U.S. government service, will
lead the U.N. team that monitors Nicaraguan elections in February,
officials announced Wednesday.
   Richardson, 69, now is in private law practice in Washington,
said he had no opinions beforehand on the fairness of the elections,
but that he has had plenty of experience in hard-fought campaigns.
   ``I've been a candidate; I've been involved in elections, I once
even ran a recount in a gubernatorial election in Massachusetts many
years ago,'' he remarked in a telephone interview Wednesday night
with The Associated Press.
   A U.N. official, speaking privately, said Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government opposed Richardson's appointment and resisted
it for weeks.
   No one at Nicaragua's U.N. Mission was willing to comment on the
appointment.
   Richardson is best known for resigning as attorney general in
protest during the ``Saturday night massacre'' episode in the
Watergate scandal.
   He quit the night of Oct. 10, 1973, the same night President
Richard M. Nixon fired Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.
   ``Well, I would like that to be remembered,'' Richardson quipped
on Wednesday.
   Richardson and a group of jurists and former U.S. officials
called the Commission on the Independence of Namibia just returned
from that country, where elections leading to independence from
South Africa are set for November.
   On Tuesday, commission members criticized South Africa's
procedures for the vote.
   U.N. officials said Wednesday that Richardson would visit
Nicaragua periodically to assess the situation for Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar, and would oversee the U.N. observer mission.
   Both the Sandinista government and the opposition in Nicaragua
asked the United Nations and Organization of American States to send
monitors.
   The first group of about 160 U.N. poll watchers already is in
Nicaragua. The OAS will send an equal number.
   Richardson had held Nixon administration posts as secretary of
health, education and welfare and defense secretary before being
named attorney general.
   He was ambassador to Britain in 1975-76 and secretary of commerce
in 1976-77 under President Gerald R. Ford. Richardson served
President Jimmy Carter in 1977-80 as a special ambassador and as
U.S. representative to the Third U.N. Conference on the Law of the
Sea.
   From 1980 until June, he was chairman of the U.N. Association of
the United States, a private, non-partisan group.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands of Teachers Strike for Higher Pay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of teachers
began a 48-hour strike Wednesday to back demands for a pay raise
that the government says would lead to more inflation.
   ``In many areas, teachers are paid less then what unemployed
people will receive,'' from the government, said Maria Sanchez,
secretary-general of the 230,000-member Confederation of Argentine
Educators.
   Wages have not kept pace with inflation, she said, and are so low
that teachers in many provinces often cannot afford bus tickets to
get to work.
   Teachers receive $46 a month in base pay, and are demanding a
raise to $114.
   The government is trying to hold down wage increases to get a
halt inflation that in July soared by 197 percent. The projection
for August is 35 percent.
   Education Minister Antonio Salonia said a raise for teachers
would encourage other unions to make similar demands, and this
``would run the risk of returning to hyperinflation.'' Salonia said
striking teachers would be docked pay.
   Ms. Sanchez said 85 pecent of her federation went on strike
Wednesday. The goverment gave no estimate.
   Private schools, including those run by the Roman Catholic
Church, remained open, as did many public schools.
   The job action is the first nationwide strike since President
Carlos Menem of the Peronist Party took office July 8, and is seen
as a test in a growing clash of wills between the government and
organized labor.
   Bus drivers, train conductors, doctors in municipal hospitals and
public employees in several provinces all are demanding pay raises.
   The 3 million member General Labor Confederation has opposed
government concessions to businesses, such as a plan to allow
workers to be hired on a temporary basis with no right to severance
pay, and refused to rule out a general strike.
   In an editorial titled ``Changing Times,'' the English-language
newspaper Buenos Aires Herald commented Wednesday: ``By a supreme
irony, the government of a labor-based party seems to be on a
collision course with the trade unions.''

   Michigan Bell agreed on a tentative contract for 12,800 telephone
workers Wednesday, allowing 37,000 Ameritech workers in five Midwest
states to head back to work and leaving NYNEX the last regional
phone company still on strike.
   Officials of NYNEX Corp., serving New York state and most of New
England, met with union negotiators Wednesday in their first talks
in two weeks.
   Ameritech's operators, repair crews and other union employees in
Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin began returning to
work at noon following the agreement with Michigan Bell. Union
workers in the five states had said they would stay off the job
until settlements were reached in each state.
   Management employees had assumed the duties of striking workers,
but backlogs of service and installation requests developed in some
states, as well as some delays in placing directory assistance or
operator-assisted calls.
   The strike at Chicago-based Ameritech began Aug. 13, one week
after strikes began at three other ``Baby Bell'' regional telephone
companies, formed after the 1984 breakup of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. The strikes had affected nearly 200,000 workers in 20
states.
   Bell Atlantic workers in six states and Washington, D.C., ended
their strike Monday after agreements were reached with
Communications Workers of America locals in Pennsylvania and
Delaware. A tentative contract settlement also has been reached at
Pacific Telesis, which serves California and Nevada.
   But 60,000 workers remained on strike against NYNEX. Since the
strike began Aug. 6, the company and the union had met formally only
twice before.
   Talks resumed with the CWA, representing most of the striking
workers in New York, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, representing New England Telephone workers. Both sides
agreed to continue Thursday.
   Myles Calvey of IBEW Local 222 in Quincy, Mass., said issues
central to Wednesday's talks with his union in Boston were health
benefits and the company's fixed liablility medical expense plan,
although wages, job safety and job security were also at issue.
   The original NYNEX proposal called for workers to contribute
$10.20 a week for health insurance. NYNEX reduced that Wednesday to
$4.50, Calvey said
   About 90 activists _ roughly half of them striking New England
Telephone workers _ marched Wednesday near the summer White House at
Kennebunkport, Maine, to urge President Bush to institute national
health care.
   ``George Bush, it ain't fair. We don't have no health care,''
chanted the marchers, who were not allowed onto the property of the
Shawmut Inn, where Bush attended a luncheon.
   The Michigan pact includes changes in employee scheduling rules
that give the company greater flexibility and an improved employee
profit-sharing plan, Mark Doman, chairman of Michigan Bell's
bargaining committee, said at a news conference.
   The three-year pact also includes wage increases and improved
health benefits, said Mike Handley, chairman of the CWA bargaining
committee, who appeared with Doman. The two wouldn't discuss details.
   Late Tuesday, Indiana Bell and the CWA announced a tentative
accord on a new three-year pact covering 4,200 striking workers.
Tentative settlements were reached over the weekend with Ohio Bell
and Wisconsin Bell, and on Monday with Illinois Bell.
   New Jersey Bell signed a tentative agreement Monday with CWA, but
has no agreement with about 9,200 workers represented by the IBEW.
The last talks were Tuesday and no new talks are scheduled.

   A fast, intense fire killed six members of a
family Wednesday, including two children whose bodies were found
only five feet from the front door, authorities said.
   The 2{-story house was engulfed in flames when firefighters
arrived after a 1:15 a.m. alarm, said Battalian Chief Frank Henry.
The fire spread to an adjacent house and two behind it, causing an
estiamted $100,000 damage in the Northside neighborhood, fire
department officers said.
   Relatives identified the victims as Wilbert Crowell, 47; his
wife, Theresa, 27; her three children, Tina Sharpe, 10, Hope
Lawrence, 5, and Bo Lawrence, 4; and the husband's mother, Sylvia
Thompson, 72.
   ``A neighbor came up and said she heard people inside screaming
but there was nothing she could do,'' said police Lt. Richard Dwyer.
   ``When I got out of my car about 100 feet away I could feel the
heat,'' he said. ``There was no way anybody could get near the
building.''
   Acting fire Chief Robert Kolenda said it was not immediately
known how the fire began or in what part of the home. Kolenda said
he saw no sign that the house was equipped with smoke detectors.
   The two youngest children were found on the first floor near the
door, the man and a woman were at the top of the stairs, the
10-year-old was on the stairwell to the third floor and the other
woman was in a second-floor bedroom, Kolenda said.

   Jurors acquitted a former Teacher of the
Year of marijuana charges Wednesday after her friends testified they
believed her claim that she didn't know her husband grew the weed in
a vine-covered greenhouse behind their home.
   ``It was the truth, and they knew it,'' Vicki Sherling said after
jurors reached a verdict in two hours of deliberations. She said she
might try to get back her job. ``I am a teacher,'' she added.
   District Attorney Lamar Cole said, ``I respect the opinion of the
jury _ and that's why we have juries, but I'll continue to prosecute
cases where drug squads find marijuana growing in someone's back
yard.''
   Mrs. Sherling, who lost her job despite her status as 1989
Teacher of the Year, took the witness stand. ``I'm trying
desperately to put my life back together. I'm trying to clear my
name,'' she testified.
   ``My picture was on the front page of the newspaper _ Teacher of
the Year charged with marijuana,'' she said. ``I spent two weeks
curled up in a fetal position.''
   Cole questioned her about marijuana found in a chest of drawers
in the couple's bedroom and about a pipe with drug residue in a
washroom chest.
   ``I trust my husband, and in one thing he betrayed me,'' she
said. ``He never told me he would quit. That would have been a lie.
He said, `Vicki I'll cut down. Vicki, I won't smoke it in your
presence.''
   Co-workers, members of a theater group and parents from a local
Boy Scout troop praised Mrs. Sherling, 38, as a woman of stellar
character who would never lie to her friends about something as
serious as marijuana use.
   ``I know Mrs. Sherling well enough to believe her if she told me
anything,'' said Mary Norman, a teacher who worked with Mrs.
Sherling at Colquitt County High School.
   Mrs. Sherling, 1989 Teacher of the Year in Colquitt County, was
charged with growing and possessing marijuana and could receive 11
years in prison and $1,000 in fines if convicted. The chemistry
teacher was fired after her arrest last spring.
   Her husband, Michael Sherling, 39, has admitted chronic marijuana
use and testified Tuesday his wife never grew or smoked the stuff.
``If she had known that I had planted marijuana in that yard, that
would have been it,'' he said.
   Sherling, a former teacher and lawyer, said he hid his marijuana
use from his wife because it had been ``a bone of contention''
throughout their 16-year marriage. He testified he built the
greenhouse at their rural home while his wife and two sons were out
of town and covered it with vines to conceal it.
   The Sherlings were arrested May 19 at their home, where police
acting on a tip said they found 22 marijuana plants in the
greenhouse.
   Police said they also found marijuana seeds and drug
paraphernalia.
   Sherling pleaded guilty to drug charges and is scheduled to be
sentenced this week.
   Jurors were brought in by bus from Valdosta to hear Mrs.
Sherling's case after defense attorneys contended she could not be
tried fairly by jurors from the Moultrie area.

   Authorities imposed curfews Wednesday on
Medellin and nine other cities in the heart of cocaine country in an
effort to curb violence by drug barons stung by Colombia's crackdown
on narcotics.
   Also Wednesday, the U.S. government ordered families of its
embassy staff to leave Colombia, a spokesman said. The order
apparently was given because of fears of attacks by drug
traffickers. It would apply to about 50 relatives of embassy staff,
the source said on condition of anonymity.
   Embassy officials also recommended that American students in
Colombia leave. Last week, the State Department began urging U.S.
tourists to bypass Medellin.
   A shipment of weapons bound for Medellin was intercepted, and
authorities said three more judges resigned in the city that
reputedly supplies the United States with 80 percent of its cocaine.
   More than 100 judges have resigned since drug traffickers vowed
to retaliate for a crackdown on drug trafficking.
   The curfews imposed Wednesday by Interior Minister Orlando
Vasquez affect a total of about 3 million people. He said the mayors
of the municipalities under the curfew have broader powers to
conduct searches, inspect vehicles and arrest suspects.
   Medellin Mayor Juan Gomez Martinez said the curfew is in effect
from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. for all vehicles and pedestrians, will remain
in effect indefinitely in Colombia's second-largest city, ``until
the nights in Medellin quiet down.''
   The industrial city of about 2 million people, 215 miles north of
Bogota, is home to the world's largest cocaine cartel. Medellin has
suffered almost daily bombings by the traffickers, who are pressing
the government to end its 12-day-old campaign and negotiate a peace.
   In a Medellin news conference broadcast by the national radio
chain Caracol, Gomez Martinez said there would be no exceptions to
the curfew. ``We will not give safe conduct passes,'' he said.
   Gomez Martinez complained of a lack of security assistance from
the national government. He has asked for 3,000 additional national
police officers to bolster the existing force of 4,000. He said the
government agreed to provide an extra 100.
   The mayor favors talks with the traffickers, but said at the news
conference that the suggestion had been rejected by the government,
and that he was carrying out all anti-narcotics measures ordered by
national authorities.
   Communications Minister Carlos Lemos Simonds said on Tuesday,
``There will be no dialogue.''
   At midday, Mayor Escobar Perez anounced an identical curfew in
the town of Itagui, 10 miles south of Medellin.
   Vasquez ordered the curfew extended to eight other communities
near Medellin. They are Bello, La Estrella, Envigado, Sabaneta,
Rionegro, Copabacana, Guarne and Caldas.
   ``Medellin has become a center of perturbation in the country,''
Vasquez told reporters.
   On Tuesday night, police in Medellin interrupted an attempt to
rocket a state-owned distillery in Medellin.
   Since the government launched its offensive and drug barons
responded with a declaration of war, the city and surrounding
communities have been rocked by at least 17 bombings and three arson
attacks, according to police reports.
   In the city of Pereira, 110 miles west of Bogota, police
frustrated an attempt to kill the mayor and a city councilman, Radio
Caracol reported.
   Caracol said an armed suspect was arrested in the city hall, but
said the motives for the attempt remain unclear. There was no
immediate indication whether it was related to trafficking.
   The report said Pereira Mayor Jairo Arango Gaviria and councilman
Raul Velez del Corral had been the target of frequent death threats.
It said security had been boosted for both men.
   National police said they intercepted an arms shipment apparently
bound for Medellin. A spokesman said the weapons, including 169
grenades for use with a launcher, 40 fragmentation grenades and 600
firearms cartridges were found in a truck carrying foodstuffs, which
stopped on Bogota-Medellin highway at La Dorada, 75 miles north of
Bogota.
   The government crackdown was sparked by a 48-hour wave of
assassinations, capped by the slaying of a highly popular
presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, on Aug. 18.
   Hundreds of homes, office buildings and other properties owned by
traffikers have been impounded along with cars, aircraft, yachts and
other goods. The army estimates the value of the property at more
than $200 million. Several midlevel trafficking suspects have been
arrested.
   According to local newspaper and radio reports confirmed by a
judge's assistant Wednesday, three Medellin judges investigating
assassinations resigned because of death threats. The reports said
two of them are believed to have fled the country.
   The assassinations under investigation were those of national
police Col. Waldemar Franklin Quintero, Judge Maria Helena Diaz
Perez and the governor of Antioquia Province, Antonio Roldan
Betancur. All three killings are blamed on traffickers.
   A total of 108 judges have resigned since the government's
offensive began, mostly in protest over what they feel is a lack of
adequate security, according to the national judicial employes'
association. The Supreme Court has been rejecting the resignations
and ordering the judges to resume their duties.
   Since 1981, 220 judges, magistrates and judicial aides have been
killed in the traffickers' highly successful campaign to cow the
courts and avoid proscution.

   A man who spent 18 months behind bars for
having oral sex with his wife was freed Wednesday by a judge who
said prosecutors would have to come up with a better reason for
putting him in prison.
   James D. Moseley, a 35-year-old carpenter believed to be the
first man convicted under Georgia's 156-year-old sodomy law for
conduct between marriage partners, was released from the Metro
Correctional Institution.
   Moseley, who had been sentenced to five years in prison, waved to
waiting reporters as he left in a private car.
   ``Sure, I'm bitter,'' he said later at a news conference at the
headquarters of the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union. But he said faith in humanity kept his spirits up.
   ``I knew someone would see this thing as it really was,'' he said.
   Moseley said the first thing he would do is contact the
carpenters' union about a job. He said he hoped to see his sons,
although he does not have visitation rights.
   He said a lengthy domestic dispute resulted in his now-former
wife claiming falsely that he used force to have sex with her. ``I
only did what she wanted me to do, and then she used it against me
to get custody of the kids,'' Moseley said.
   Moseley was charged with rape, aggravated oral sodomy and
aggravated anal sodomy over two encounters with Bette Roberts, his
common-law wife of four years. Aggravated sodomy constitutes oral or
anal sex without consent.
   Moseley was acquitted of those charges, but a jury found him
guilty of sodomy without aggravation, or oral or anal sex with
consent, because he admitted on the stand that he had had oral sex
with Ms. Roberts.
   Sodomy, even between a consenting husband and wife, is a felony
in Georgia.
   On Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Robert Castellani ordered
Moseley freed, noting that he was found guilty ``only of an act
involving an act between two married adults.''
   He said Moseley must be freed on his own recognizance unless the
state could find a reason to hold him.
   Clive Stafford Smith, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer,
told the judge that the prosecutors should disqualify themselves if
they ever had engaged in oral sex. ``We cannot have a `do as I say
not as I do' syndrome,'' he argued.
   The judge rejected the motion without comment.
   Stafford Smith also argued that the Georgia law violates
constitutional rights to privacy.
   But Mary Beth Westmoreland, a senior assistant attorney general
representing the state, said privacy was not at issue. ``It's not a
matter of police peeking in windows. That's not what is before this
court,'' she said.
   She said the state became involved because Ms. Roberts complained
to authorities. The couple, who had two children, have since
divorced.

<HEAD>Argentina Upholds Extraditing Schwammberger as Nazi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PLATA, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court ruled Wednesday that Josef
Schwammberger may be extradited to West Germany to face charges that
as a Nazi camp commander he personally killed dozens of people at
forced labor camps in World War II.
   However, the 77-year-old Schwammberger may appeal the ruling of
the federal appeals court to the Supreme Court and thus stave off
immediate extradition to Stuttgart, West Germany.
   ``Frankly, Schwammberger is not a young man ... We're concerned
that the final appeal not take as long'' as the initial proceedings,
said Rabbi Marvin Hier, director of the Los Angeles branch of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.
   Schwammberger was discovered living in Argentina in November 1987
and has been held in jail ever since in La Plata, 30 miles south of
Buenos Aires.
   He is being kept in a hospital at the penal center because of his
age and ill health, the government news agency Telam reported.
   A Stuttgart court issued an order for Schwammberger's arrest in
1973. He is accused of being responsible for the deaths of at least
5,000 people, mostly Jews, at two labor camps he commanded in
occupied Poland.
   ``We have witnesses that say he threw men, women and children
alive into bonfires,'' said Hier. ``He smashed children into walls
and then set dogs on them to tear them apart.''
   Defense attorneys have asked Argentine authorities to deny the
extradition request, or to hold any trial in Argentina. They have
five days to appeal to the Supreme Court.
   Hier said the French army arrested Schwammberger in 1945, but he
escaped on Jan. 1, 1948. He came to Argentina in 1949, was
naturalized as a citizen in 1953 and was granted full citizenship in
1965.
   Argentine officials said he lived in La Plata and worked for a
chemical company for many years.

   A Colombian who was twice convicted of
cocaine charges and deported from the United States has been
arrested in San Francisco and charged with illegal re-entry,
authorities said Wednesday.
   If convicted, Francisco Portocarrero could be sentenced to 15
years in prison and fined $250,000 under new federal laws stiffening
punishment for deported drug traffickers who re-enter the country
illegally, said U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello.
   He said Portocarrero was convicted in San Francisco in 1983 of
importing and possessing with intent to distribute 340 pounds of
cocaine. He was sentenced to prison for two years and then deported,
Russoniello said.
   Portocarrero returned to the United States and was deported again
in 1985 after being convicted in Louisiana of possessing 18 pounds
of cocaine, Russoniello said.
   He said U.S. immigration agents arrested Portocarrero Aug. 16 in
a San Francisco tavern. He was indicted by a federal grand jury
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Princess Anne, the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth
II, and husband Mark Phillips are separating, his father said
Wednesday. A television report said they will divorce.
   A Buckingham Palace press officer refused to comment on the
reports but said a palace announcement would be issued Thursday
morning.
   Maj. Peter Phillips in a statement said: ``For the moment they
are going to live separately. They are not going to divorce but will
be separating.''
   It added: ``They will not be living far away from each other.
Princess Anne will remain at Gatcombe (Park, the family home in
western England) and Mark will be moving about two miles away.'' The
statement said this would happen ``in the near future.''
   Sky Television said the palace would issue a statement saying the
couple, who have been married 15 years and have two children, would
divorce.
   Anne, 39, was attending an International Olympic Committee
meeting in Puerto Rico Wednesday. Her 40-year-old husband, an
ex-Army captain, was at home at Gatcombe Park.
   The princess, who is the head of the International Equestrian
Federation, was in private meetings in San Juan all day. She was
rarely seen and two bodyguards kept reporters at bay at all times.
   Telephone calls to her room at the Caribe Hilton hotel were
automatically deflected to switchboard operators, who would not
allow calls through.
   Rumors of trouble in the marriage have circulated since 1981, and
in recent years the princess and her husband have spent periods of
up to six months apart.
   She has become one of the busiest members of the royal family as
president of the Save the Children Fund, a charity that works on
behalf of poor children around the world. Her husband has traveled
widely for business and equestrian interests.
   Speculation that their marriage was in trouble arose most
recently in April after letters written to Anne by an aide to the
queen were stolen and sent to the tabloid The Sun.
   The Sun, Britain's biggest circulation newspaper, did not
disclose the content of the four letters and said it gave them to
police.
   Buckingham Palace then identified Timothy Laurence, a 35-year-old
bachelor, as the writer in a bid to stop intense news media
speculation.
   Phillips told reporters at that time that his marriage was ``fine
and happy.''
   On Aug. 23, the queen personally awarded Laurence the Royal
Victorian Order as he left her personal service after three years as
her aide to take command of a frigate. The citation said the order
was awarded for ``extraordinary, important or personal services to
the sovereign or the royal family.''
   Anne's aunt, Princess Margaret, the queen's only sister, was
divorced in 1978 from Lord Snowdon, who has since remarried.
   Anne is sixth in line to the throne.

   An empty 600-gallon fuel tank fell
from a fighter jet north of a popular beach resort Wednesday,
authorities said.
   There were no injuries or property damage when the 15-foot,
500-pound tank dropped from an F-4 Phantom jet near Rehoboth Beach,
said Capt. Walter Thorp, a Dover Air Force Base spokesman.
   State police said the tank was found in an empty field about half
a mile north of the resort.
   Three fighters, assigned to the Air National Guard's Washington,
D.C.-based 113th Tactical Fighter Wing, took off earlier from
Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on a training missing, the Air
Force said.
   Thorp said he did not know how fast nor how low the jets were
flying, but he said they were following a certified training route.
The tank was carried directly under the fuselage at the center of
the jet, Thorp said.
   The Air Force planned to recover the tank on Thursday, Thorp said.

   Two buses loaded with passengers and driven by
soldiers pressed into service during a bus strike collided on an
expressway, killing 20 people, police said Wednesday. More than 30
people were injured.
   The head-on collision occurred at 7 p.m. Tuesday about four miles
from the center of Lima on the main artery connecting the southern
suburbs with the downtown, police said.
   Witnesses said the buses were packed with passengers returning
home from work.
   Published reports Wednesday quoted witnesses who said they saw
one bus swerve to avoid a child running across the road. Police had
no comment on whether lack of experience on the part of the drivers
figured in the accident.
   The buses belonged to the state-owned transportation company
ENATRU, whose drivers struck last week demanding higher wages.
Company officials said members of the armed forces were ordered in
to drive the buses during the strike.
   The strike is one of many plaguing Peru. Strikes by miners,
teachers, and electrical and telephone workers recently created a
state of chaos throughout the country.
   Many of the injured had to be taken to police and military
hospitals because a three-month strike by public doctors has left
many hospitals and emergency rooms unattended.
   Hospitals treating the casualties appealed for blood donations
Tuesday night as supplies ran short due to the number and severity
of the injuries.
   Most of the strikes are for higher wages to offset the effects of
hyperinflation now ravaging Peru's economy. Analysts expect
inflation to pass 5,000 percent this year.

   In addition to resolutions urging U.S. economic sanctions against

   The nation's fourth-largest Protestant denomination also urged
participation in a ``Burger-A-Month'' campaign, in which each person
gives $2 a month _ the approximate cost of a hamburger _ to
alleviate world hunger.
   About 1,040, delegates representing 5.3 million U.S. Lutherans
expressed special support for small rural and urban congregations on
the eighth and final day of their meeting in this Chicago suburb.
   In a ``throwaway society'' where ``new is valued more than old
and bigger is often seen as better,'' rural communities are in
economic crisis and inner cities suffer ``blight, poverty'' and
flight of businesses, the resolution said.
   The assembly called for vigorous U.S. efforts to determine the
fate of U.S. prisoners of war and those missing in action in
Vietnam, and encouraged Lutherans to be alert to advances in science
and technology.
   ``We must learn'' from science, said the Rev. Larry Lenning of
Independence, Iowa.
   Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the assembly said
achieving peace required ending abuses against Palestinians, but
also stressed security for the Jewish state and confessed past
``sinful complicity as Lutherans'' against Jews.
   The miners backed by the Lutherans have been on strike against
Pittston Coal Group since April 5.
   The assembly was the first since the January 1988 merger of the
Lutheran Church in America, the American Lutheran Church and the
Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.
   ``It demonstrated that it is right for us to be together. There
was 100 percent enthusiasim, a marvelous identification of us as a
church,'' Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom of Chicago, president of the
denomination, told a post-meeting news conference.
   Chilstrom said the assembly's decision to join the major
Chrisitian ecumenical bodies, the World Council of Churches and the
National Council of Churches, were ``signs of great maturity.''
   He said he was impressed by the diversity of the delegates. In
addition to whites, there were blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans
and American Indians. Nearly half the delegates were women.
   Chilstrom noted that the mainly white church was established with
a mandate to include people of different cultures. ``We've got a
long way to go, but we're on the way,'' he said.
   Asked about the church's budget crunch, he predicted a turnaround
in congregational contributions because of the ``Mission 90''
program adopted here.
   ``It takes a long time to turn around a ship as big as the ELCA,
but it's going to turn around,'' Chilstrom said.
   ``Mission 90,'' a new long-range program for the 1990s,
emphasizes Bible teaching, evangelism, tithing and work for peace,
justice, and the environment.
   Following one of the most heated debates of the assembly, the
delegates earlier set a Sept. 1, 1991, deadline for the church
pension board to sell all shares in companies doing business in
South Africa. Those investments are valued at $84.9 million.
   ``Seting a date to be completely divested could be a problem for
the Board of Pensions,'' Chilstrom said. However, he said all
delegates agreed that apartheid, South Africa's racial system of
government, must be dismantled.
   Another divisive issue was abortion. The assembly on Monday
approved a resolution some interpreted as pro-choice, then
reconsidered and decided to remain neutral on abortion pending a
two-year study. The next assembly is in 1991.

<TEXT>
   The director and several other officials of
Cuba's state railroad company were fired after an inquiry into a
crash that killed 52 people, the official Cuban news agency Prensa
Latina said Wednesday.
   Prensa Latina said the dismissals were ``meant to strengthen
discipline'' in the railroad company.
   An investigation by a special commission revealed that the crash
of two trains in Matanzas province was caused by ``grave and
repeated violations'' of railroad rules, the news agency said in a
dispatch monitored in Mexico City.
   The dispatch also said preliminary results of an investigation
into a derailment in Guantanamo province that killed 19 people this
month show that slack discipline contributed to that accident as
well.
   Cuba's emphasis on dicipline comes after several military
officers were found guilty of drug trafficking in July and others
were tried this week for defrauding the state.

<HEAD>Singer Pavarotti Cancels in Chicago; Told He's No Longer Welcome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenor Luciano Pavarotti cancelled this season's
appearance with the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and was told in return
Wednesday that he's no longer welcome to perform with the company.
   The famed singer's manager, Herbert Breslin, told the Lyric that
a persistent inflammation of Pavarotti's sciatic nerve prevents him
from performing in a live opera at this time, the company said in a
news release.
   The Lyric, which is entering its 35th anniversary season with the
house 99 percent sold out, said the singer cancelled 26 of the 41
performances he was under contract to do for the company this decade.
   ``That's quite a record!'' said Lyric General Director Ardis
Krainik. ``Lyric Opera is now unwilling to take the risk of one more
cancellation by Mr. Pavarotti,'' she said.
   Miss Krainik said the Lyric is not interested in considering any
other future engagements with Pavarotti, and has withdrawn from
negotiations for performances in 1991.
   She said the tenor has had a growing reputation for cancellations.
   In May with the Pittsburgh Opera, Pavarotti walked off the stage
when his voice cracked during the third act of Puccini's ``Tosca.''
   Asked if there was any reason to think his cancellation in
Chicago was motivated by something other than health, Miss Krainik
said, ``That's not the point.The point is, he cancelled.''
   She said she felt that with his record of cancellations, she had
no choice but to sever ties with the singer, who first performed
with the Lyric in 1973.
   Breslin said he and Pavarotti have the greatest respect for the
Lyric and Miss Krainik. But the manager said he believes she is
acting ``a little bit irrational,'' particularly since Pavarotti has
been the greatest fund raiser in the Lyric's history.
   ``I think she gets the impression that he is doing this out of
some kind of spite for the Lyric Opera of Chicago, which is
absolutely wrong,'' Breslin said.
   Pavarotti had been scheduled to perform in ``Tosca'' on six dates
in late September and early October.
   Neither the Lyric nor Breslin would discuss the singer's fees.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Humane Association filed a $10
million libel lawsuit Wednesday against game show host and animal
rights activist Bob Barker and others.
   The lawsuit contends that Barker and animal rights organizations
have conducted a two-year ``vendetta'' against the association and
its West Coast regional director, Betty Denny Smith, said
association attorney Barry Langberg. Ms. Smith also is a plaintiff
in the lawsuit, filed in Superior Court.
   ``From the standpoint from the American Humane Association and
Betty Denny Smith this was a very reluctant suit,'' said Langberg.
``They did not want to sue Barker. They want to devote their
energies to protecting animals.''
   The lawsuit accuses Barker, the United Activists for Animal
Rights and its executive director, Nancy Burnet, of libel, slander,
trade libel, interference with prospective business relations,
conspiracy and false-light invasion of privacy, said Langberg.
   ``I have no legal background but I believe that to be sued for
these things the statements I made had to be untrue. And of course,
they were not,'' Barker said in response to the lawsuit.
   Telephone calls seeking comment from Ms. Burnet and the United
Activists were met with repeated busy signals.
   A separate claim was filed against the city and Department of
Animal Regulation head Robert I. Rush for allegedly assisting Barker
in the campaign, Langberg said.
   ``I haven't even seen it,'' said Rush, ``but the conduct of this
office in the past has been beyond reproach and it is currently
beyond reproach. The claim will be discussed with the city attorney
and a response will be made.''
   Langberg said the lawsuit charges that Barker, on radio, accused
Ms. Smith and the association of condoning animal cruelty. The
association was founded in 1877 for the protection of animals and
children, and the West Coast regional office has been active in
protecting animals used in the entertainment industry.
   Barker, longtime host of the television game show ``The Price Is
Right,'' has been involved with animal rights for many years and in
1987 quit after 19 years as host of the Miss USA Pageant because
contestants wore fur coats.
   He was the 1987 winner of the highest award given by directors of
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
   ``I have never been sued but I'm sure it's a very unpleasant
experience. It has to be expensive and it has to be
time-consuming,'' Barker said. ``But if this suit results in the
American public becoming more aware of the extent of animal cruelty
in entertainment then the suit will have served a very valuable
purpose and it will be well worth the money and the time it costs
me.''

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The Peace Corps has decided to send
volunteers to Haiti, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said
Wednesday, nearly two years after it suspended its mission here due
to widespread violence.
   Fifteen volunteers will arrive in January, and 15 more in June,
she said. They will work in health, education, and farm programs,
she said.
   Peace Corps director Paul Coverdell said in Washington on
Wednesday he believed the political situation in Haiti had improved.
``There is a stable government now,'' he said.
   Coverdell said the embassy judged security was satisfactory for
foreign nationals in the country.
   For months, Haiti has been plagued by murders and burglaries
while police have done little to maintain security.
   The Peace Corps, operating in 65 countries, suspended its program
to Haiti in December 1987, shortly after violently aborted
presidential elections in which at least 34 voters were massacred at
the polls by thugs protected by soldiers. Nineteen Peace Corps
volunteers were withdrawn.
   Richard Melton, assistant undersecretary of state for Caribbean
affairs, last month expressed U.S. government satisfaction with
progress in democratization made by ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   Also Wednesday, the United States and Haiti signed a $300,000
anti-drug trafficking aid agreement. The funds will be used to equip
the Haitian government with surveillance equipment to help it combat
drug smuggling.

<HEAD>Former Mine Director Appears In Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former director of Mexico's largest copper
mine is among 20 people arrested in an investigation into
mismanagement of the bankrupt state enterprise, officials said
Wednesday.
   Carlos David Ortigosa, spokesman for the federal attorney
general's office, said Emilio Ocampo Arenal, director of the Cananea
mine until last March, appeared before a judge Wednesday night to
testify. Ortigosa said Ocampo would be jailed afterward.
   ``Other people implicated are being investigated,'' Ortigosa told
The Associated Press by telephone. ``Twenty have been detained.''
   The attorney general's office said the government was
investigating ``a series of possibly fraudulent acts, embezzlement
and other illicit acts the company suffered and attributable to
diverse people from 1983 to 1988.'' No charges has been filed.
   It said the government obtained statements from employees at the
bankrupt mine that accused Ocampo of receiving undeclared
commissions on foreign sales of copper.
   The mine was declared bankrupt Aug. 20, throwing 3,200 miners out
of work. The federal government, a 90 percent owner in the open-pit
operation, sent 3,000 soldiers to close the mine site, 25 miles
south of the Arizona border. The soliders were later withdrawn.
   The closing came one week before the miners had scheduled a
strike to pressure for their demands representing a 330 percent
wage-and-benefit increase.
   The government is seeking a buyer for the operation.
   Miners and politicians have called for an investigation of the
union's management to determine how the company became insolvent.
   The Excelsior news service said Ocampo is son-in-law of former
President Luis Echeverria, who served from 1970 to 1976.

   President Daniel Ortega said
Wednesday he will go to Libya to take part in ceremonies this week
marking 20 years of power for the leader of that radical North
African Arab country, Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   Ortega made the announcement in this city 60 miles north of the
capital at a ceremony handing over 230 property deeds to 508 peasant
families.
   ``We are willing to have good relations with Bush and also with
Gadhafi,'' Ortega said. He said that if the U.S. president invited
him to Washington, ``I would go to the United States to meet with
Bush.''
   Ortega said he would proceed from the Saturday ceremonies in
Libya to Belgrade, Yugoslavia to take part in the four-day summit of
non-aligned nations, which ends Monday.
   The president also said that to date his government has freed
from prison 283 peasants who were accused of supporting the rebels,
known as Contras.
   ``There are still 1,129 counterrevolutionaries in prison who were
counted by the International Red Cross Committee'' last week, Ortega
said. The president emphasized that the government will free the
others, but did not say when.
   Ortega said the U.S.-backed Contras, 11,000 of whom are in camps
in Honduras, have kidnapped 7,478 people. He demanded that ``the
counterrevolutionaries hand over the kidnap victims'' who are still
alive.
   He said that when the Contras hand over their arms ``we are
willing to receive them like brothers.'' The government has
announced a general amnesty for Contras who return to participate in
Nicaraguan life.
   ``But those who do not accept the friendly hand we are extending,
we will give them our fists until we crush them.''
   In a statement in Managua on Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said
two Sandinista soldiers were killed when rebels blew up a truck
carrying soldiers in the town of Mongallo near the Caribbean coast
on Tuesday.
   No claim of responsibility came from rebels.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has promised democratic
reforms and set an election for Feb. 25 in accordance with an
agreement signed by Central American presidents on Aug. 7 in Tela,
Honduras.
   The accord called for disbanding the Contras by Dec. 8 with a
U.N. team to observe the process.

   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu opened
his first official U.S. visit Wednesday with an impromptu news
conference in which he said he will be discussing trade issues this
week with President Bush.
   Kaifu turned what was supposed to be a 10-minute stop at the
Japanese Cultural Center into a half-hour lunch visit at which he
fielded questions from reporters.
   Asked about the purpose of his visit, Kaifu said: ``I want to
make rock-solid the relationship between Japan and the United
States.''
   Another questioner raised the issue of Japan's $55 billion annual
trade surplus with the United States.
   ``I plan to talk about this with the president of the United
States,'' Kaifu said through an interpreter. ``We will be continuing
the dialogue.''
   Because Kaifu is a relatively little-known political figure,
there have been suggestions that his trip is primarily a
get-acquainted visit that will give him some international exposure
and divert attention from influence-peddling scandals that have
shaken his party.
   A senior Foreign Ministry official in Japan who briefed reporters
before the trip said that Kaifu is not bringing major trade or
diplomatic initiatives.
   Kaifu, 58, took office on Aug. 9 after the resignation of Prime
Minister Sosuke Uno, whose money-for-sex affairs with geisha and
cabaret hostesses contributed to a major defeat for the Liberal
Democratic Party in elections in the upper house of parliament last
month.
   Kaifu planned to meet with Bush Friday in Washington, D.C., and
also make stops in Boston, Mexico City and Canada during his 10-day
trip with his wife, Sachiyo.
   Kaifu told the crowd at the cultural center he had fond memories
of his first visit to the United States 27 years ago, when he rented
a car and drove along the Pacific Coast Highway.
   Kaifu's itinerary was to take him Thursday to Washington,
Saturday to Boston, Monday to Mexico City, Wednesday to Ottawa and
Friday to Vancouver, British Columbia.

<HEAD>Don't Hold Your Breath for Democratic Government in Panama</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A democratically elected government was
supposed to take power in Panama tomorrow. But as President Bush
said, don't hold your breath.
   Bush has said he sees no sign that strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega will yield power voluntarily.
   The Panama knot is as tangled as ever, on the eve of what was
supposed to be a transfer of power to a new elected president. There
isn't any, because the regime Noriega dominates as commander in
chief decreed that the elections his side lost were not going to
count.
   The Organization of American States spent the summer trying to
mediate a path to democratic government. All it managed to do was
produce a statement expressing concern that its mission had not
succeeded, and urging Panamanians to work out their differences
themselves.
   When that was attempted in a May 7 election, and Noriega's regime
apparently lost, his government simply annulled the election returns
after the fact. For good measure, Noriega's paramilitary supporters
beat opposition candidates bloody when they staged a protest march.
   The OAS then tried its hand, rebuking Noriega and sending
emissaries to seek a peaceful transition to democratic rule, in time
for the Sept. 1 inauguration date set by the Panamanian
constitution. Noriega's side offered to share power in a provisional
government, with the general still holding his command, but the
opposition rejected that deal.
   That left no deal.
   The United States wants Noriega out. It also wants to put him on
trial for drug trafficking under two indictments returned in Florida
in February 1988. The Reagan and Bush administrations have been
trying to dislodge him ever since, imposing economic sanctions,
withholding Panama Canal revenues, and helping to finance the
opposition campaign for the abortive elections last spring.
   But Noriega remains commander of the Panama Defense Forces, and
that hold on power does not seem to have been shaken. ``I'm not
holding my breath on his voluntary departure,'' Bush told a
mid-August news conference.
   The long stalemate is a case study in the uses and constraints on
U.S. power in Latin America, even in Panama, where some 13,000
American troops are stationed.
   Bush described those limits when he said there would be no
unilateral use of U.S. troops to deal with the drug crisis in
Colombia.
   ``I know enough about this hemisphere, and I've had enough
experience in dealing with countries in Latin America _ in South
America, Central America, all through the Caribbean _ to know the
constraints that exist in terms of _ or should exist in terms of
dispatching troops,'' he said at a news conference on Aug. 23. Those
constraints apply in Panama, too.
   Playing on Latin American sensitivities, Noriega constantly
complains that the United States is intervening, interfering and
bent on rescinding the treaties under which Panama will take over
the Panama Canal in 1999.
   The OAS mediation team criticized the United States for
conducting military maneuvers in Panama this summer, saying that had
a ``negative effect'' on its effort to negotiate a transfer of power.
   The United States said other OAS nations should join in isolating
the Noriega-backed government that apparently will continue in
power. Assistant Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger called it
an ``outlaw regime.''
   Eagleburger said Noriega is allied with cocaine traffickers in
aggression ``as surely as Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland 50 years
ago was aggression.''
   Bush has left open the possibility that Noriega might somehow be
seized if he is not extradited. ``We have an indictment out against
Gen. Noriega for drug trafficking,'' he said on Aug. 15. ``I'm told
that it's a good indictment.
   ``I'm not saying what I would do or wouldn't do. ... I have an
obligation to try to bring people to justice.''
   Bush has said that the United States ``will continue to support
what the people of Panama voted for'' in their aborted election.
   The question is how. The president's most recent answer was that
he didn't know for sure.
   Pressure for tougher U.S. action is certain to increase, in
Congress and elsewhere. There already are proposals in Congress to
suspend or abrogate the Panama Canal treaties. The administration
reportedly is considering stiffened economic sanctions. And there is
always military option.
   Sol M. Linowitz, who negotiated the canal treaties, says OAS
mediation remains the right course. ``To date the negotiating
efforts of the OAS have been proceeding fitfully, but the reports
from the negotiating table give some reason for hope. ...'' he wrote
in The Washington Post.
   He said that effort should get more time.
   ``The Bush administration has made a good start toward addressing
the crisis in Panama by encouraging a regional diplomatic
solution,'' Linowitz wrote. ``We should stick with it.''

   The border's blurring effect on language and
culture is apparent in signs sprinkling Laredo's crowded downtown
shopping district: ``Madre India,'' ``Ropa Hindu,'' ``Bombay
Connection'' and ``Casa Hari.''
   In the past decade, an enclave of merchants from India has
established itself in the nation's most Hispanic city. Spanish and
English meld with Hindi, Sindhi, Gujarati and other tongues from the
Indian subcontinent.
   On the back wall of Ramesh Tewani's Madre India No. 2 jewelry
store on Zaragoza Street is a prominent figure of Ganesh, the Hindu
god of good luck. Tewani came to the United States from India, and
moved to Laredo in 1977, about the same time other Indians began
converging on the border city.
   ``What brought me to the U.S.? Business,'' said Tewani, who sells
gold and Italian jewelry. ``The Mexicans come and they buy gold from
me in large quantities.''
   His 20-year-old son, Mohan Tewani, runs the Madre India No. 1,
featuring high-fashion costume jewelry, just a few blocks down the
same street.
   More than 90 percent of their business comes from Mexicans who
survey the retail selections before making their own large wholesale
purchases, say the Tewanis and other Indian merchants on Juarez and
Zaragoza streets. They say they found success in Laredo and spread
the word to other Indians.
   Many of the Mexican customers smuggle the goods into Mexico to
get by their country's tariffs and trade restrictions, the Indian
merchants say.
   Mayor Aldo Tatangelo, a retailer, remembers a wave of Indians
``just coming and coming and coming'' in the early 1980s to set up a
gold trade.
   ``I call it the `Gold City,' because there's so much gold in
there. The Indians are good in jewelry. It's very important to them,
and they've got good connections with the factories in Italy.''
   Tatangelo estimated that jewelry stores, now dominated by
Indians, sell as much as $500 million in gold to Mexicans shopping
in Laredo. Others have moved into other lines, including cheaper
jewelry, electronics and clothing.
   As a result, more than a few Indians live in the fashionable Del
Mar ``C'' and Regency Park neighborhoods on the city's north side.
   While the Indian immigrants have adapted to the U.S. and Mexican
cultures, there is also an effort to preserve some of their roots.
   The India Association of Laredo's 33 families meet regularly for
a dose of culture. On Sunday, Aug. 13, they met at Ramesh Tewani's
house for a ``katha'' or thanksgiving prayer session. Afterwards,
they raised the Indian flag to celebrate India's independence day. A
letter sent to members, written in English, concluded with the
message: ``Viva. Indian Independence.''
   Association President Kishin Rupani, owner of Dayasons Costume
Jewelry &amp; Gifts, said the group helps maintain a close-knit
community. Indian singers and entertainers touring the United States
sometimes are paid to make side trips to perform at members' homes.
The association usually meets at homes because there is no Indian
temple or movie theater.
   As with most immigrants, however, identification with the new
country increases with the time here, particularly among the young.
   Mohan Tewani has a shrine in the back of his store, but is unsure
of the names of Hindu gods revered there. ``My father would be the
expert on that.''
   Command of the various native languages also is weakening.
   ``Ultimately, they have to blend in with the society,'' said
Rupani's daughter, Soma, a banking and finance major at Laredo
Junior College.
   ``Actually, we are Americanized in a way, but we're more
conservative with dating and things like that,'' said Soma Rupani,
21. ``You've heard of the arranged marriages? You have to stay
within your community.''
   Some parents still arrange their children's marriages, she said,
but even that institution has been liberalized by time in a new
country.
   Twenty-six years ago, Rupani didn't meet Soma's mother until they
were engaged.
   Today, ``I will know the guy, but the one they approve of is the
one I will marry,'' said Soma Rupani. ``That's how we have changed a
little.''
   Andy Lakhiani moved to Laredo four years ago after nearly being
killed by an armed robber in his former shop in Dallas. Nearly every
square inch of his small store, Casa Hari on Juarez Street, is
packed with of plastic necklaces, earrings, scarves, gold-filled
jewelry, perfumes, sunglasses, clocks, purses and other merchandise
destined primarily for south of the border.
   Lakhiani, originally from Bombay, said his three children ``don't
recognize Indian culture'' but he doesn't care. ``It's good to be
aware of roots, but you have to adapt, you have to blend in,'' he
said as a radio behind the counter played music from a station
broadcasting from Mexico.

   Actress Lauralee Bell visited rape treatment
centers and talked to counselors before starting a summer-long story
about date rape on the CBS daytime serial ``The Young and the
Restless.''
   The story followed the rape of her character, fashion model
Cricket Blair, by her boyfriend played by Ken Olandt, and his
subsequent trial.
   ``We've just finished the trial and the jury was about to turn
him loose when my brother found another girl he had raped on a
college campus,'' said Bell, 20. ``The judge allowed us to bring in
the new witness. I just got a script where I tell the college
officials that if they'd listened to her I wouldn't have been
raped.''
   The trial ended last week with his conviction on a charge of rape.
   Bell went to the Los Angeles Commission on Violence Against Women
and treatment centers, where she talked to rape victims and
counselors.
   ``This is a good story to do in the summer when a lot of students
are home,'' said Bell. ``The people I talked to said the incidence
of date rape on college campuses is going up and up. I was just on a
personal appearance in Oklahoma where two women told me they had
friends who reported rapes after seeing our show.''
   She said the boyfriend in the show gave little indication that he
would attack her.
   ``He was the handsome All-American boy,'' she said. ``He was
always looking after me. You'd never suspect. The only sign was that
he was a touchy-feely kind of person.
   ``We've stressed that you should learn about a person. And when
you go on a date set your limits right away. We've tried to make it
realistic so girls will know what to expect if it should happen to
them.''
   ``The Young and the Restless,'' the top-rated daytime soap opera,
does a major story aimed at young people every summer. In past years
they've done stories on alcoholism, teen-age pregnancy and AIDS.
   Bell has gone through a lot of trauma in her time on ``The Young
and the Restless.'' Her character's mother has AIDS and earlier this
year she learned her fiance is actually her brother and his father
is actually her father.
   Bell, whose own father is the boss of the top-rated soap opera,
has been with the show full time for the past two years. She made
her first appearance at 9 and at 13 began making regular appearances
as Cricket whenever she had time off from school.
   ``The audience liked it because they'd never seen someone so
young grow up on a show before,'' said Bell. ``I became a teen model
for the cosmetics company that's the focus of the show. The children
of viewers could watch me and get tips on makeup. The message was
don't overdo your makeup, but I didn't buy that myself. I went
through the makeup phase, too.''
   Her father is William J. Bell, who is executive producer and
co-creator with her mother, Lee Phillip Bell. They're also the
creators of CBS's ``The Bold and the Beautiful.'' One brother,
Bradley, is a writer for ``The Bold and The Beautiful.'' Another
brother, Billy, is in charge of finances for both shows.
   Lauralee still lives at home with her parents. In fact, all of
the family lives in a large compound in the Hollywood Hills. The
Bells moved here only a few years ago after writing and producing
the show from Chicago.
   ``It was great that my father was the producer. But you have to
work twice as hard,'' Lauralee says. ``People expect you to come in
and be this obnoxious little thing. I never complained about my work
schedule, I never complained about my hair or makeup. I worked hard
to prove myself. I don't run to my father and I don't carry tales.
My parents never come on the set when I'm working.''

<TEXT>
   It looks as though there is plenty of reason for
optimism heading into the traditional ``business New Year'' at Labor
Day, 1989.
   The holiday was established 95 years ago as a national event
honoring working people _ a special moment of respite from toil.
   But over the decades it also has evolved into a time for planning
and launching new efforts toward progress and achievement, a rolling
up of sleeves and getting back to work after the diversions of
summer.
   By most accounts, the circumstances that prevail heading into the
last four months of 1989 are about as favorable as they ever get in
any piece of machinery as diverse and complex as the U.S. economy.
   There hasn't been a recession in nearly seven years and
predictions of the likely time of the next downturn have lately been
pushed back again.
   Revised figures issued by the government this week showed the
economy growing at a 2.7 percent annual rate, after adjustment for
inflation, in the second quarter of the year _ up from an earlier
estimate of 1.7 percent.
   Faced with that kind of evidence, fears have been fading fast
that the Federal Reserve's campaign to restrain inflation would
result in any sort of severe business slump.
   The inflation-fighting mission appears, meanwhile, to have met
with at least some short-term success. The consumer price index rose
at a 0.2 percent annual rate in both June and July, half the pace it
set over the previous five months.
   The producer price index of finished goods, which provides a
measure of subsurface inflationary pressures, has been falling
recently, as have prices of most raw commodities.
   There was no widespread drought this year, as there was in 1988,
to put pressure on supplies and prices of farm products. World oil
prices haven't made any menacing moves of late.
   ``Economic data released during July and August suggest that the
economy is in a phase of disinflationary growth, a combination of
rising growth and declining inflation that typically occurs during
periods of economic recoveries,'' observed Anthony Vignola and
Stephen Gallagher, analysts at the investment firm Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co.
   ``Sensitive economic indicators all point to a strengthening
economy.''
   Along with its benefits, however, that prospect poses some
problems. If the economy is going to keep chugging along, the
chances would logically be reduced for a further decline in interest
rates.
   That, in turn, would stand as a setback for many of the numerous
people and businesses carrying heavy debt burdens these days, as
well as for those who hoped cheaper mortgages would help them buy or
sell a house.
   A stronger economy also would imply that the Federal Reserve
might go back to restrictive inflation-fighting after a recent
period of stimulating the banking system with a shot of
anti-recession medicine.
   Nevertheless, many analysts say, it is worth remembering that
through most of the 1980s the American economy has tended to reward
the optimists while punishing those who bet on bad times.
   ``The economy got off to a good start for the current quarter,''
stated Paul Boltz, financial economist at the investment management
firm T. Rowe Price Associates. ``If July is any indication, the
likelihood of a recession looks small this year.
   ``To be sure, a boom does not look in prospect either. But a soft
landing followed by a slow takeoff should keep Washington
policymakers satisfied.''

<HEAD>When Buying Foreign Real Estate Don't Expect A Shangri-La</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gene Cowell and his family were hooked on the
pristine beaches, lush tropics and spectacular sunsets of Barbados,
and nine years ago they did what most vacationers only dream about:
they set up house there.
   But their $60,000 one-bedroom waterfront condominium ``off the
beaten path,'' was anything but paradise.
   ``We were uncomfortable with some of the aspects of living in
Barbados that tourists wouldn't necessarily be aware of,'' said
Cowell, an advertising executive from Guilford, Conn. ``It was a lot
more crowded than we thought ... there were social problems . .. and
high taxes.''
   Many others intoxicated by an idyllic overseas stay this summer
could end up as unhappy as the Cowells _ who've since sold their
Barbados condo for one elsewhere in the Caribbean. International
real estate experts and vacationers-turned-property owners warn all
potential buyers to use their heads, not their emotions when making
such foreign investments.
   ``You have to do your research,'' said Jeanne Begg, president of
Begg International, a Washington real estate firm with listings in
Europe and the Caribbean.
   Cowell used his experience to set up Island Properties Report, a
monthly research publication that provides tips on buying real
estate in the Caribbean and the Bahamas and lists available
property. The publication costs $2 a copy; a sample copy is free.
   For the more adventurous, the Key Largo, Fla., publication
Private Islands Unlimited provides a listing of islands for sale
around the world, ranging from a small undeveloped isle off Belize
selling for $15,000 to full-scale resorts for around $10 million.
The annual fee is $25.
   Wherever you might be looking, don't expect many bargains. ``The
world has become small enough so that people don't get the bargains
they used to get,'' said Mrs. Begg.
   In Europe, especially, real estate has appreciated at about the
same staggering rate as with many U.S. properties. A home in
London's Docklands section, near the Thames River, which cost around
$20,000 20 years ago now fetches more than 10 times that price.
   ``Paris is out of sight,'' added Mrs. Begg, noting that a flat in
that city is just as expensive as in Manhattan. ``You might be able
to get good deals in un-chic places.''
   Mrs. Begg recommends that those seriously considering buying
vacation property abroad spend as much time in that country as they
can, particularly in the off season, to get a feel for local life
and to check out essentials like water availability. Renting first
is also suggested.
   Each country has its own restrictions and laws that should be
reviewed with a local attorney. Some, such as Italy, don't allow
foreigners to take profits from the sale of their property out of
the country. Others, like Mexico, prevent outsiders from actually
owning land near the coast or the border.
   In the Caribbean, many countries impose a ``foreign purchase'' or
``alien landowners'' tax of about 10 percent of the purchase price
when you buy and 8 percent when you sell.
   Foreign banks also have their own set of restrictions, and most
won't give you a mortgage, experts say. While U.S. banks will
provide money for foreign home purchases, most prefer a hefty down
payment of around 30 percent to 50 percent, they say.
   Experts say a home-equity loan may be the best way to finance a
second home overseas.
   Like second-home mortgages, the interest is deductable no matter
where you buy, providing the value of your primary and secondary
homes don't exceed $1.1 million, said Jack Rodman, managing director
for Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., a Los Angeles accounting firm
specializing in real estate. But he warns that to receive a full
deduction you can only borrow $100,000 above the value of your
existing mortgage.
   To help offset expenses some people rent out their foreign
properties. However, Cowell warns you should be prepared to share
part of that income with the locals you'll have to hire to clean or
manage the property.
   You also should be prepared for delays, whether in closing the
deal or renovating property.
   ``In many countries time is not of the essence,'' said Donald
Ward, publisher of Private Islands Unlimited. ``Building supplies
may also be limited.''
   Fern Pomerantz, of Cleveland, Ohio, who subscribes to Cowell's
Island Properties Report, can vouch for that. She recently wrote in
the newsletter that it took 1{ years to build a house on property
she bought in St. Kitts, and even after it was completed she had to
put up with a few minor inconveniences.
   ``The surprise of discovering 20 cows outside our window each
morning ... (necessitated) the immediate construction of a fence,''
she said.

<HEAD>Trustful Religious Settings Are Fertile Field for Crooks</HEAD>

   Trust is a basic attitude of religious people,
who also stress open acceptance of strangers. These traits make them
particularly vulnerable to swindlers.
   That's the thrust of a report by the North American Securities
Administrators and the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
   Based on a survey of cases from state securities agencies, the
report finds ``an alarming increase in the number of investment
schemes peddled to religious people.''
   ``Organizers of such swindles appeal to the high level of trust
often found in religious groups and communities.''
   Titled ``Preying on the Faithful: The False Prophets of the
Investment World,'' the report says more than 15,000 Americans have
lost more than $450 million in such scams in the last five years.
   A ``growing number of investment swindlers and other sharp
operators ... play on religious beliefs in order to gain the trust,
confidence and life savings of the faithful,'' the report says.
   It details major cases in 15 states where operators, usually
feigning religious motives and sometimes claiming God-endowed
business talents, gained confidence of believers _ and their cash.
   The sharp increase in such operations ``has resulted in a surge
in state-level complaints from consumers about fraud and abuse by
self-proclaimed `born again' financial planners,'' the report says.
   It says they often pretend to be endorsed by local or national
church officials or to offer ``divinely inspired investment advice
about coins, precious metals, real estate and oil and gas well
programs.''
   John C. Baldwin, director of the Utah Division of Securities and
president of the North American Securities Administrators
Association, says:
   ``It now appears that religiously oriented swindles are one of
today's hottest tickets for investment con artists.
   ``The problem here is not religion, but the growing number of con
artists who are cynically exploiting religious faith in order to
fleece unsuspecting members of the flock.''
   James H. McIlhenny, president of the Council of Better Business
Bureaus, says the religious swindler feigns interest in religious
beliefs ``only insofar as they can be used to run a scam.''
   ``They will go to any lengths, including the exploitation of
churches and deeply held religious beliefs, if they think it will
work. They will take their 30 pieces of silver any way they can get
them.''
   Baldwin describes this common mode of operation:
   A con artist picks some religiously identifiable group, passes
himself off as a member in order to put victims at ease. They, in
turn, often drop their guard and fail to check out him or the
so-called investment opportunity.
   Baldwin said the approaches usually are much the same, but the
promoted investments may be almost anything. He said one outfit used
Old Testament prophecy to pinpoint spots for oil wells in Israel.
   Many ``con artists advertise their services in religious
publications and on Christian radio stations,'' he says, while
others obtain religious mailing and telephone lists and use direct
mail and ``cold-call'' tactics.
   Some operate on a ``face-to-face basis,'' renting church
basements or making appearances before church social groups, he
says. These schemes ``with the personal touch'' seem to hit the
elderly hardest.
   Whenever a religiously oriented scam starts to unravel, Baldwin
says the con artist often claims authorities were trying to ``ruin''
or ``embarrass'' the faith or church.
   ``Frequently this tactic gives the con artist the time he needs
to move to the next congregation,'' Baldwin says. This can also
delay complaints to state agencies so long that his ``trail is too
cold to follow.''
   Baldwin emphasizes that the five-year estimate of more than
15,000 Americans losing more than $450 million includes only
large-scale religious scams, each with losses exceeding $500,000,
and not smaller swindles.
   Offering tips for avoiding such scams, the report lists various
danger signs, including:
   _ Investments that seem closely tied to a particular religious
belief.
   _ An investment promoter who tries to capitalize on status or
influence in a particular religious group.
   _ A new member turns up with a ``sure fire'' investment scheme.
   _ Any investments promoted by fellow church members, since the
``most persuasive hook'' of con artists is to get ``testimony of
your friends and fellow believers.''
   Sometimes swindlers plead for ``Christian forgiveness'' or warn
of harm to the faith if the scam is exposed, the report says, adding:
   ``Don't listen to these self-serving appeals'' or be talked into
``letting an investment crook off the hook. He or she will just take
the opportunity to move on to greener pastures _ and new victims.''

   With AIDS appearing in many countries, the
National Council of Churches is expanding efforts to inform
missionaries about the virus and how to reduce risks of contracting
it.
   Member denominations are being provided with educational
materials, special sterilized injection kits and other resources for
missionaries as they are sent to their fields.
   ``The risk of AIDS is real for missionaries serving in infected
areas, but not very high if a person takes precautions,'' says Dr.
John Frame, NCC consultant on health affairs.
   Of 40,000 American Protestant missionaries serving overseas, six
are known to have been infected with the AIDS virus, four of them
stationed in Africa and two in the Caribbean.
   Another missionary, a hemophiliac infected through a transfusion,
died of AIDS in Australia, Frame says.
   ``The risk to missionaries is almost certainly related to
profession (medical) or events that cannot be predicted, such as
accident or complications in pregnancy requiring blood
transfusions,'' he says.
   ``There is also the risk of getting an injection from
inadequately sterilized equipment.''

   A professor at Southern Baptist Union
University has resigned in a conflict with the administration over
his teaching that a saved, believing Christian can fall into
unbelief and be lost.
   The university's administration had cut teaching duties and
salary of the Rev. Clyde Tilley, a religion and philosophy professor
at the school for a quarter century, because of his views on the
issue.
   Tilley says the case was ``part and parcel of the broader
conflict'' among Southern Baptists whose denominational offices have
become dominated by a fundamentalist wing.
   Hyran Barefoot, the university's president, says Tilley didn't
hold to the Baptist doctrine of ``eternal security'' of the
believer, that a person once saved is always saved.
   Tilley says he agrees that ``all believers are eternally
secure,'' but that people can revert into unbelief and deliberately
renounce salvation. He says ``this view is compatible with the
eternal security of the believer, since the apostate would no longer
be a believer.''
   A faculty affairs committee recommended that Tilley be retained
in his regular post at the same pay, but this was not accepted by
the school's trustees, mostly appointed by the denomination's
fundamentalist leaders.

   For five months, shells have rained down on
Beirut, and its people have lived in a crossfire of horror. Eating,
sleeping, having a cold drink _ everyday things others take for
granted _ have become a daily challenge. This is another in a series
of occasional reports by Associated Press correspondents on Beirut
life _ one family's ordeal.

   For Fuad Abboud and his family in
Christian east Beirut, it is a triumph just to get through the day.
   They are without water and electrity and have little fuel for
cooking because of almost constant Syrian bombardment and a blockade
of supplies.
   Even the most mundane day-to-day chores, washing dishes, cooking
meals, doing the shopping, taking showers, are a challenge.
   Most of Beirut's 1.5 million people, Christians and Moslem alike,
have fled.
   But the Abboud family, and thousands like them, stay on in
Beirut, keeping the city's pulse beating, however faintly; clinging
tenaciously to the splinters of their lives despite the catastrophe
that has befallen them.
   ``I dreamt we had electricity last night,'' said 13-year-old
Rania Abboud. ``In my dream I even saw light streaming from one of
the rooms.''
   She awakened from her dream and, half asleep, got up to turn on
the stereo she hasn't played for weeks.
   ``Then I realized that the light came from the candle,'' she said
softly.
   In Rania Abboud's dream the electricity had come back on.
   Fuad Abboud, 60, a calligrapher for a publishing house; his wife,
Hiyam, 47; Rania, and her 17-year-old brother, Rabih, live in
Hazmieh, one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in east Beirut.
   They live on the second floor of a five-story apartment block
near the Green Line that divides the city into Christian and Moslem
sectors, the front line in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   The area has been heavily shelled by the Syrian army in its
5-month-old battle with Christian militias.
   ``Some nights the shells fall in a torrent, like rain,'' Abboud
said.
   Every building around them has been hit at least once. Theirs has
not. Luckily, it's surrounded by taller buildings.
   Joseph Abu-Jaouden, one of their neighbors, went to the bakery
for bread one recent morning during a lull in the shelling. On his
way home, he was killed in a surprise barrage.
   The Abbouds' water taps are dry, their beds unused because it's
too dangerous to sleep in them. The refrigerator serves as a
cupboard. The washing machine is silent, the lights out, the
television dark.
   Water and electricity were cut off months ago.
   Mrs. Abboud hides her jewelry in a neighbor's pressure cooker.
   ``It's the last place I think thieves would look,'' she said.
   She has moved her favorite dresses from her bedroom in the outer,
exposed part of the building to a hallway in the apartment for
safety.
   Not that she wears them anyway. Social life stopped months ago.
No one goes out unless they have to.
   Mrs. Abboud doesn't bother with makeup any more and usually wears
a loose, ankle-length Arabic gown known as an abaya around the
apartment.
   ``I've forgotten what it's like to be a woman,'' she said.
   A widow, Fadwa Azar, and her son in the apartment next door have
a gasoline-fueled generator on their balcony that runs their
refrigerator, television set and other appliances. The Abbouds keep
their essential foods in Mrs. Azar's refrigerator.
   The Abbouds long for cold drinks _ no room for soft drinks in
Mrs. Azar's refrigerator. A hot meal is rare. The family hasn't
tasted ice cream or chilled fruit since the fighting broke out March
8.
   The Abbouds' apartment block doesn't have an underground shelter,
as many buildings do. So most nights the Abbouds sleep squeezed
together on mattresses and quilts on the floor of a stuffy,
unventilated hall in Mrs. Azar's apartment at the rear of the
building, less vulnerable to the shelling from the Moslem west side.
   ``Our life is dictated by the whims of the fighters,'' Mrs.
Abboud said. ``We sleep and we eat and we go to work when they allow
us.''
   Most fearsome are the 240mm and 180mm mortars the Syrians fire.
The heavy-caliber weapons were designed to knock out underground
military bunkers, bridges and airstrips. But they're being used
against apartment and office buildings, causing awesome damage and
many casualties.
   ``They're a nightmare,'' said son Rabih. ``We almost don't mind
what the Syrians fire any more _ except those damned 240s and 180s.''
   On one recent day, the Abbouds were awakened at 5 a.m. They're
usually not early risers, but the rumble of fighting along the Green
Line made sleep impossible and they headed for the hallway in Mrs.
Azar's apartment.
   The fighting subsided two hours later. The Abbouds wearily
returned to their apartment, sticky from the humid summer heat,
rubbing cramped legs and stiff necks. The temperature reaches 95
degrees during the day this time of year in Beirut.
   ``I'd give anything, anything for one week of sleeping in my own
bed,'' Mrs. Abboud said with a sigh.

   Everyone had to wash with just half a bucket of water.
   Mrs. Abboud said they once went without washing for four days
because the shelling was so heavy no one could go out to fetch water
from a spring in the neighboring Ashrafieh district, a constant
target for the Syrians.
   When there's gasoline to be found and the shelling stops, Rabih
drives through the rubble-strewn streets to fill six 10-liter
(2\-gallon) plastic canisters with water from the spring.
   His mother frets while he's out, praying he'll get home before
the shelling starts again.
   The family needs about 13{ gallons of water a day for drinking,
washing dishes, bathing, flushing toilets and keeping the house
clean.
   Mrs. Abboud has learned to wash the dishes in a bucket, then use
the water to flush the toilet.
   Many Beirutis use bottled water for ``showers.'' One woman said:
``I use one for the front and another for the back.''
   The Abbouds use the water sparingly, trying to keep some in
reserve for the days when the shelling is heavy and Rabih can't go
to the spring.
   At 8 a.m. one recent day Mrs. Abboud sent Rania to fetch cheese,
milk and yoghurt from Mrs. Azar's ``collective fridge.''
   Rania returned empty-handed. Mrs. Azar was out and Rania couldn't
get into her apartment. The Abbouds made do with stale bread dipped
in olive oil and thyme.
   Abboud goes to the local bakery, if it's open, three days a week
at 5 a.m. On a good day, he'll have to wait in line only an hour.
   Sugar is in short supply, to Rabih's chagrin. He likes his tea
sweet.
   After breakfast, Abboud looked out the window at the street below.
   ``When I see people in the street, I reckon it's safe to go to
work,'' said Abboud, whose office is a 10-minute walk from his
apartment.
   There was some traffic this day, so he made a run for it. He wore
a wrinkled shirt because with no electricity his wife can't iron
clothes.
   After he left, his wife fidgeted nervously until he telephoned to
say he'd arrived safely.
   Abboud earns 80,000 Lebanese pounds ($160) a month at calligraphy
and, unlike many Lebanese, gets paid regularly. He supplements his
salary with freelance work at home. His eldest son, Fadi, 26, who
works in Liberia in western Africa, regularly sends money home.
   Asked why he hasn't taken the family out of Beirut, Abboud said
Moslem forces are near his cottage in the mountains at Bikfaya and
it is just as exposed to shellfire as the Beirut apartment. He
doesn't think there's much difference where the family lives.
   As for fleeing abroad, ``I can't afford it,'' he said.
   Schools have been closed for five months. But Rabih and his
sister do school work at home and turn it in to their teachers every
two weeks, when they receive new assignments.
   Their father nags them to study for two hours a day. But Rabih
said: ``It's really hard because I just can't concentrate.''
   Mrs. Abboud makes sure everyone's there when she prepares a meal
because gas for cooking is scarce and she doesn't want to waste it
to reheat food.
   She buys gas for the stove in a container that once cost the
equivalent of $1.50 and now sells for $16.
   As Mrs. Abboud was making lunch this day, Hazmieh came under
shellfire again.
   The family ended up eating half-cooked french fries in the
stairwell as the steaks lay uncooked on the kitchen table.
   When the shelling intensified, the Abbouds scurried to Mrs.
Azar's apartment. The fetid air and the constant pounding of
exploding shells made everyone jittery.
   At nightfall, the shelling eased and the Abbouds groped their way
back to their apartment in the dark to make sandwiches before
returning to their ``bedroom'' in Mrs. Azar's apartment.
   Rabih held a large bottle of Pepsi and said longingly: ``If only
you were ice cold.''
   At 8 p.m. Mrs. Azar turned on her television set to watch the
evening news on the Christian network.
   Everyone listened intently to learn which areas had been hit,
who'd been killed.
   The newscaster started on the foreign news.
   ``Switch it off,'' Mrs. Azar said, curtly. ``The world doesn't
care about us. Why should we care what's happening to them?''

   As he stretched his long legs before a
class, 18-year-old Duncan Cooper recalled some of the less glamorous
moments in his 13 years of ballet training.
   ``When I was younger, I'd get called a sissy,'' he said. ``I
mean, ballet's not like the national pastime. It's not like
football. It's not a thing that's in. And it's not a source of
national pride like it is in Europe. I've been beaten up before,
when I was in junior high here in San Francisco.
   ``But that's not the important thing. The important thing is that
I'm doing what I want to do and it's something I'm good at. And no
one can take that away from me.''
   Cooper's devotion is a rare thing, and it has just paid a
magnificent bonus: He has been accepted into the company of the San
Francisco Ballet for the 1990 season.
   Like so many other aspiring and talented dancers, Cooper studied
at the San Francisco Ballet School. Many of the students are lured
from area public schools for that chance at dance fame.
   Charles McNeal scouts schools for the company, interviewing
children who in all likelihood have never even seen a ballet
performed. Relying on experience and a little luck, he carefully
selects youngsters to invite to the San Francisco Ballet School to
determine if they might be destined to follow in the footsteps of
Pavlova or Nijinsky.
   ``We try to identify students who have the talent, who can
experience the joy of dance,'' he said. ``The first thing to look
for is a spark in the eye. That one little spark is what we nurture
along the way.
   ``Then there's the basics, the physicality _ the feet, the limbs,
a good jumper _ and the musicality. ... You develop a keen eye. But
you cannot look at an 8-year-old and know if he will become a
professional dancer.''
   Students selected by McNeal, and scores of others auditioned
through more traditional methods, find a rare opportunity at the
school, whose mission is nothing less than to prepare its students
for a career in ballet.
   Hundreds of schools across the country teach ballet, but only a
few are affiliated with major companies. The San Francisco Ballet
School ranks among the best with a new multimillion-dollar facility,
top instructors and a close tie to Helgi Tomasson's critically
acclaimed company.
   Students need enough talent to get in, enough spirit to compete,
enough stamina to sustain them and enough love for ballet that
they'd gladly give up many of the joys of youth for a chance to
dance.
   McNeal says only one in 100 of the 8-year-olds will ever dance
professionally, and only half of those will dance with a major
company.
   The school also auditions about 2,000 dancers in 15 cities each
year to find the 140-150 students for its six-week intensive summer
program.
   ``We select them because they show us some potential for
professional careers by virtue of their physique, their prior
training, their desire, their discipline, that sort of thing,'' said
Nancy Johnson Carter, who danced with the San Francisco Ballet
before becoming the school's manager.
   A few summer students are invited to stay at the school at the
end of the session. Still others come to the school after first
studying ballet elsewhere in the San Francisco Bay area.
   However they get there, each student seems to have caught
``ballet fever'' in a unique way. Maybe their mother took them to
``The Nutcracker'' on a rainy afternoon. Perhaps they saw Mikhail
Baryshnikov dance on television. Some started by studying tap or
jazz. Whatever got them started, the result is the same: They all
have the passion to dance.
   ``That's not to say every 8-year-old in the building has decided
to be a professional ballet dancer,'' Carter said. ``They don't make
that decision until they're a teen-ager, usually.
   ``However, no matter what else we teach them, our main goal is to
make them professional ballet dancers.''
   Students who start at age 8 soon learn how serious a challenge
they face.
   ``And it becomes more serious very rapidly,'' Carter said. ``In
their first year of study, they take two classes a week. That's an
hour and a half a class. By the second year, they're here three
times a week. By the third year _ now they're 10 or 11 years old _
they're here three times a week, but they're taking six lessons. By
the fourth year, it goes to eight.''
   That means a child of 11 or 12 is taking 12 hours of class a week
after school. Through the teen years, the training intensifies,
forcing students to skip pep rallies, parties and after-school
activities. But the students know they have to train if they want
the rewards of a dance career.
   ``Their parents might think they're sacrificing,'' said Carter.
``Certainly, my parents thought I was missing out on a lot. But I
also traveled the world three or four times with a ballet company
and went to places my contemporaries have yet to go.
   ``You have the experiences of dancing for kings and queens. It's
such a different kind of life, and the rewards are so great ... that
I don't know that dancers consider it a sacrifice.''
   Certainly, Dominique Young doesn't. The 14-year-old has been
dancing for seven years and last year performed as Clara in the
company's staging of ``The Nutcracker.''
   ``My mother was a dancer for a while and I saw pictures of her
dancing, and I thought how wonderful it was. And I went to see `The
Nutcracker,' and I loved it,'' she said. ``If you have a strong will
to become a dancer, it really can come true.''
   Former student Paul Gibson, 20, graduated from the school and was
welcomed into the company last year. He started dancing jazz at age
6, switched to ballet at 13 and never regretted it for a moment.
   ``It's not a long career, like other fields where you can go into
your 60s or 70s. But it's a great career with traveling and just
being out on stage,'' he said.

<HEAD>Festival Reforms After von Karajan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIOREL URMA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SALZBURG, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the death of conductor Herbert von
Karajan, the Salzburg Festival is changing its image to open up the
celebrated cultural event to new forms of art and musicians who've
never been invited to play.
   ``The festival has become an old museum, unaware of what's going
on artistically in the world. We should give modern music and drama
the place they deserve,'' said Hans Landesmann, a member of the
festival board, in an interview.
   ``There is no crisis but just time for change. This necessity has
been in the air for years.''
   Gerard Mortier, director of the Brussels Opera, was recently
named artistic director of the Salzburg Festival with a mandate to
revamp the cultural showcase.
   For years, the festival had been criticized for being too
expensive and a storehouse of the artistic totems of Karajan, its
longtime guiding spirit who died July 16 of a heart attack at age 81.
   The five-week festival opened July 27 with Giuseppe Verdi's opera
``Un Ballo in Maschera,'' under the baton of Sir Georg Solti.
   Karajan had been criticized for his domineering and conservative
stance. Italian media called the festival an ``intrigue nest,''
totally subordinated to Karajan's commercial interests.
   In his long career, Karajan made more than 800 recordings, many
of them with the Berlin and Vienna orchestras. His fortune was
estimated at 3.5 billion schillings ($270 million). Although he
resigned from the five-member directorate last August after an
illness, he had retained a veto over virtually all productions.
   Landesmann, a wealthy Vienna businessman with international
contacts, was asked by the government to work out a reform program.
In June, before Karajan's death, the board, overruling him, agreed
in principle to Landesmann's plan to modernize festival management.
Under the plan, to be formally adopted in fall, the unpaid honorary
five-man directorate will be replaced by a permanent salaried
three-member board.
   The new board, comprising a president, an artistic director and
an economic director will work full time for the festival,
Landesmann said.
   ``We need new, forward-thinking people in the management, much
more aware of the contemporary scene,'' he said.
   Albert Moser, the festival president and a Karajan loyalist who
is to retire in 1991, will also be replaced.
   In another major change, Landesmann said he would like to include
artists in the new artistic advisory board to counsel on new
projects. He would also like to see more film and video galas and
exhibits to be staged during the festival _ the world's
longest-running and most costly one.
   While not playing down the merits of Italian traditional operas,
which have been performed here every year, Landesmann proposes to
include other composers, such as Richard Strauss or Alban Berg, the
Austrian artist who combined atonality with the lyric and dramatic
features of the Viennese romantic tradition.
   There is talk among festival organizers to devote the 2,600-seat
Great Festival Hall to foreign classical opera and the Little
Festival Hall to Mozart productions.
   ``We want a repertoire consistent with the line of Mozart's
heritage, something specific, typical of Salzburg,'' Landesmann said.
   In an attempt to prevent the rise of another domineering maestro
such as Karajan, Landesmann said no permanent conductor will be
named, but invitations will go out to such well-known figures as
Solti, Ricardo Muti, Claudio Abbado or Sir John Pritchard, all of
whom were in Austria this summer.
   ``Karajan was opposed to reforms. He was an old man and he didn't
like changes. He was opposed to see new people and he used to ask
why should we change the structure of the festival,'' Landesmann
said.
   Karajan, a native of Salzburg, who had conducted at the festival
since 1948, was its sole artistic director in 1956-60 and a member
of the directorate since 1964.
   Now in its 69th year, the Salzburg festival pays some of the
highest performer fees in Europe, and charges some of the
continent's top ticket prices.
   Five years ago, government auditors urged festival organizers to
spend less. Press chief Hans Widrich said the festival runs an anual
budget of $27 million, of which state subsdies total $7.7 million
with the rest coming from ticket sales, radio and TV rights.
   Ticket sales this year range from $4 for standing room at a
concert of sacred music to $250 for the best seat at one of the
opera performances.
   However, not all agree on the need for reform.
   Solti, musical director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, who
replaced Karajan for the Verdi opera, said the ticket prices should
stay as they are.
   ``I don't believe that lowering their price and making them cost
10 schillings (77 cents) apiece would solve anything. All hotel
doormen will rush to buy them officially and then resell them on the
black market at a high profit,'' he said.
   Solti said he was not concerned about the artistic quality of the
festival, which he considers very good.
   ``Politicians are talking too much. Once its quality goes down
then you can say, `hey, we must change something.' But not for the
time being,'' he said.
   British film director John Schlesinger, who staged Verdi's opera
on the opening night, praised Salzburg, saying ``There is no house
in the world offering the kind of facilities, expertise and
officialdom's support we get here. We don't think we will find again
similar conditions.''

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's leading wildlife official
says Kenya's game parks remain safe despite four fatal attacks since
July, including the slaying of conservationist George Adamson.
   Richard Leakey, the director of wildlife, blamed the attacks on
elephant poachers who have turned to banditry after being driven out
of the animal reserves by Kenya's campaign to save its elephant
population.
   He noted that the three fatal attacks before Adamson was slain
Aug. 20 took place in particularly remote areas and far from the
usual tourist or safari trails.
   His death and the killings of a Connecticut woman and a French
couple in July raised fears for the health of Kenya's tourist
industry, the country's No. 1 income earner.
   But Leakey said he saw no reason for visitors to fear for their
safety so long as they stay in regular tourist areas and on main
roads.
   ``I have traveled widely in the last few weeks to assess the
situation for myself,'' he said after Adamson's death. ``Most of our
wildlife areas where the majority of tourists go are in my judgment
reasonably safe and there should be no need for tourists to fear
going there.''
   The 83-year-old Adamson was shot to death near his camp at the
remote Kora National Reserve in eastern Kenya while trying to help
an assistant and a guest who were being robbed by three gunmen.
   Adamson, a retired game warden, had lived in Kenya since 1924
and, with his wife, Joy, helped to popularize conservation through
their practice of releasing captive lions into the wild. Joy, who
was killed by a servant in 1980, detailed the unique practice in the
books ``Born Free,'' ``Living Free,'' and ``Forever Free,'' which
subsequently were made into movies.
   In July, a French husband and wife were killed in the Meru game
park, east of Mount Kenya, when they stumbled onto a group of
poachers while driving down a seldom-used track.
   Little more than two weeks later, on July 27, nine men attacked a
19-member tour group organized by the Connecticut Audubon Society on
a 40-mile stretch of dirt road between the southern national parks
of Tsavo and Amboseli, killing Marie Esther Ferraro of Bethany, Conn.
   Seven tourists have been wounded in separate attacks since
September a year ago. Tour operators say several hundred tourists,
mostly Americans, have been frightened off by the violence.
   Although the cancellations were quickly replaced by new bookings,
the tour operators expressed fears Adamson's death would prompt
other tourists to cancel or defer plans to visit Kenya.
   ``They call and want to know if it's safe to come to Kenya,''
said the manager of one large safari company who spoke on condition
he not be identified by name. ``We try to reassure them.''
   Another safari group said it received 50 cancellations in the
four days after Adamson died.
   Tourism is of prime concern to the government.
   Last year, a record 660,000 tourists visited Kenya's game parks
and Indian Ocean beach resorts and brought in an estimated $350
million, outstripping income from the main export, coffee.
   The tour operators expressed their anxieties recently at a
meeting with Leakey, who sought to allay their fears.
   He said roads, allowed to fall into disrepair in recent years,
were being regraded and resurfaced to provide quicker and therefore
safer journeys. Plainclothes security officers have been posted in
most of the major tourist lodges in Kenya's game parks, he said.
   In an interview later, Leakey claimed that because of the
intensified anti-poaching operation, Kenya's tourist attractions
actually are safer now than six months ago. Most of the attacks, he
said, had occurred outside the national parks.
   Using more than 300 new weapons and 45 new vehicles, along with
increased air surveillance and renewed foot patrols, Kenya has
brought poaching virtually to a halt since Leakey's appointment in
April.
   The number of elephants killed has dropped from an average three
a day to three since June, he said. In the last decade, the
slaughter by poachers reduced Kenya's elephant population from
65,000 to 17,000.
   About three dozen poachers have been killed in the combined
effort by the department of wildlife, police and paramilitary units,
said Leakey. In the last few months no game rangers have died at
poachers' hands.
   The revitalized effort has brought poachers under new pressures,
Leakey said.
   ``Previously people weren't being hurt because they didn't
feature high on poachers' lists because elephants were so easy to
get,'' he said.
   Now, he added, ``they don't know where to go, they have nothing,
they're short of cash and they've turned to robbery.''
   Leakey said the government believed it was dealing with fewer
than 100 of the armed bandits, whom he identified as indigent
Somalis called Shifta who have fled their war-torn, impoverished
country to exploit Kenya's elephants for their ivory tusks. Ivory
fetches $110 to $155 a pound on the world market, a record price.
   ``Until very recently, there was very easy money to be made in
the national parks by killing elephants,'' Leakey said. ``Nobody was
after them. There was no danger. It's very risky now to go into
Tsavo if you're a poacher.''
   Although Shifta have robbed and harrassed citizens in eastern
Kenya since the early 1960s, David Stiles, an anthropologist who has
studied Shiftas for nearly two decades, said many of those
perpetrating the violence were deserters from Somalia's army which
is fighting a rebellion in northern Somalia.
   Leakey said the Shifta were spread along a swath of arid, remote
territory from Tsavo's periphery up to Meru and posed little threat
to those who stayed on main roads and tourist byways.

   If you didn't know better, you'd swear it was
this TV season, not last year's, suffering from the creative woes of
a writers strike.
   The 1989-90 season that officially begins Sept. 18 offers
witches, nuns, inner-city teachers, cute families and buddy cops.
   Very little here hasn't been seen before.
   Alarmingly, there are fewer exceptions to the rule that network
fare must strive to reach new depths of mediocrity. This isn't going
to help the networks stem the audience erosion that has plagued them
in recent years. Who wouldn't rather rent a movie that be stuck with
``Baywatch?''
   In seasons past, previewing the fall shows generally revealed a
few that broke the same-old-stuff mold _ the ``Frank's Places'' and
``Miami Vices'' and ``Hill Street Blueses.''
   Most of this year's new shows range from dismal to mediocre _ BUT
...
   ABC does have the admirable ``Life Goes On,'' a wry and realistic
family drama whose cast includes a real-life Down's syndrome actor
playing a teen-age son who has the condition.
   And CBS has ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' a sophisticated, inside-show
business comedy starring Jon Cryer (``Pretty in Pink'') as a
mail-room nobody instantly elevated to high-powered agent. It was
created by Hugh Wilson, who was owed one by CBS after the network
canceled his critically acclaimed ``Frank's Place.''
   Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, producers of the hits ``The Cosby
Show,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``A Different World,'' will try to do it
again with ``Chicken Soup,'' on ABC, starring stand-up comic Jackie
Mason as a nice Jewish man having an affair with his Catholic
neighbor, played by Lynn Redgrave.
   And CBS has ``Major Dad,'' a sitcom starring the bankable Gerald
McRaney (``Simon &amp; Simon'') as a macho, right-wing Marine trying to
adjust to married life with a liberal wife (Shanna Reed) and three
step-daughters.
   NBC could break some ground with the political crime drama
``Mancuso, FBI,'' starring Robert Loggia as the burned-out FBI agent
he played in the provocative miniseries ``Favorite Son.''
   And no one can accuse ABC's ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' of
copy-catting. The half-hour ``dramedy,'' from Steven Bochco (``L.A.
Law,'' ``Hooperman'') revolves around a 16-year-old boy wonder who
is a physician.
   Otherwise, the fall lineup looks like rehashes, also-rans and
sleep aids.
   NBC had little room for improvement, having already pummeled ABC
and CBS for four seasons. But in its effort to seek the perfect
prime-time schedule it has deigned to do some minor tinkering,
adding five new shows. ABC and CBS added nine and eight,
respectively.
   There's NBC's ``Sister Kate,'' starring Stephanie Beacham, former
glamour girl on ``Dynasty,'' who is surprisingly well-cast as a
crotchety nun with a passel of precious urchins.
   ``Nutt House'' is mindless slapstick about an ill-run New York
hotel, starring Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman. It comes from Mel
Brooks, who teamed with wunderkind Alan Spencer, creator of ``Sledge
Hammer!'' It is paired with ``Night Court,'' which looks like
educational television by comparison.
   What would society do without a network hour devoted to the
emotional involvements of scantily clad lifeguards? NBC has met the
challenge with ``Baywatch,'' sadly the only show on this season from
Mr. Quality Television, Grant Tinker's company.
   Do you miss ``Miami Vice?'' NBC replaces it with another
buddy-cops show. This time, it's old cop-young cop and called
``Hardball.'' Not as much style as ``Vice,'' but good character
possibilities.
   Third-place CBS, which has the greatest need for breakout shows,
has settled instead for a bottom-of-the-barrel ratings ploy,
``Rescue 911,'' a graphic ``reality-based'' show about emergency
calls. It is a throwback to the early days of last season when the
writers strike crippled production of fiction shows and the networks
had to stoop to stuff like this. This season, CBS is putting it on
by choice.
   CBS' ``Island Son'' lured perennial miniseries star Richard
Chamberlain back to series television with a Hawaii locale and a
role as a doctor. It wasn't available for pre-season scrutiny.
   ``The People Next Door,'' a sitcom about a cartoonist and his
family, relies on special effects and apparently hopes to capitalize
on the success of ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.'' It's an ambitious
attempt, but doesn't work.
   ``Wolf'' stars Jack Scalia in another version of the discredited
cop who becomes a private eye and tries to clear his name. There's
nothing to help viewers pick this one out of a lineup.
   CBS' ``Peaceable Kingdom'' stars the durable Lindsay Wagner as a
remarkably boring zoo administrator. The cheetah is a better actor.
   Stephen Cannell (``Wiseguy,'' ``Hunter'') has a third network
show, ``Top of the Hill,'' starring William Katt (``Greatest
American Hero'') as a long-haired surfer who takes over his ailing
father's congressional seat. Civics 101 was more riveting.
   ``Snoops'' is a screwball mystery-comedy starring Tim and Daphne
Maxwell Reid, former stars of ``Frank's Place.'' He is a professor
of criminology, she is a protocol officer. Nothing was available for
pre-screening, but these are likable stars.
   ABC's ballyhooed deal with Bochco has yielded the questionable
but competent ``Doogie Howser,'' starring Neil Patrick Harris as the
16-year-old genius with a medical license.
   CBS made a little headway with the Western ``Paradise'' last
season. ABC, perhaps inspired more by the success of CBS' ``Lonesome
Dove,'' adds another of the long-missing Western genre, ``The Young
Riders,'' about the Pony Express. It needs better writing.
   ABC has two innocuous spinoffs. From ``Who's the Boss?'' comes
``Living Dolls,'' a sitcom about four teen-aged models sharing an
apartment in New York. Michael Learned stars as their den mother.
The other is ``Family Matters,'' a black family sitcom centered on
the extended family of acerbic elevator operator, Harriette, of
``Perfect Strangers.''
   A writer-producer spun off ABC's ``Head of the Class'' to create
a black ``Welcome Back, Kotter'' in the new ``Homeroom.''
   In ABC's ``Free Spirit'' a housekeeper who's a witch goes to work
for a single father. What comic possibilities!
   To recap, CBS has two good bets in ``Major Dad'' and ``Teddy Z,''
both joining the reasonably successful Monday comedy lineup. But
they'll likely be moved to other nights.
   ABC's ``Life Goes On'' deserves a break and might get one. It's
in a time period opposite the top-10 ``60 Minutes'' and isn't
expected to do boffo numbers, so it might stay around a while.
Critical response should help it.
   ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' is an acquired taste, but it has a cushy
time slot, behind ``Roseanne.'' Hey, a lot of people think Jackie
Mason is very funny.
   Likely goners, due to low quality and-or tough competition,
include ``Homeroom,'' ``Peaceable Kingdom,'' ``Wolf'' and ``Free
Spirit.''
   ``Nutt House'' could get a cult following of over-medicated
viewers, but don't bet on it.
   The rest of the pack merit little more than a shrug.
   So there you have one of the reasons that almost two-thirds of
homes with televisions also have cable and why a third of viewers
opted for something other than network programs last season.
   This season, those people will pay their cable bills happily.

   Networks are beginning the new TV season with
a new fact of life _ increasing sponsor scrutiny of the shows on
which their ads appear.
   The heads of the networks insist there will be no censorship by
advertisers or pressure groups, but they also say they're looking
more closely at shows of questionable taste. The question is whose
``taste'' will prevail?
   NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff, whose network
vowed to air the critically acclaimed but controversial TV movie
about abortion, ``Roe vs. Wade,'' without sponsorship, if it came to
that, said he was concerned about a possible trend toward
programming-by-boycott last season.
   ``What you become concerned about is sort of a new McCarthyism,''
he said. ``What I was fearful of is, today `The Sex Tapes,' tomorrow
`Dear John.'''
   Last season, sponsors balked at so-called ``trash TV'' fare, but
also at ``Roe vs. Wade,'' because of the subject and the critically
praised miniseries ``Lonesome Dove,'' because of its authentically
raunchy Western dialogue.
   But the network bosses said advertisers, from whom the networks
draw their revenues, have the right to withhold sponsorship of shows
to which they object and in fact have always shied away from certain
programs.
   ``We get advertiser pullout all the time,'' said CBS
Entertainment President Kim LeMasters. ``That is a normal landscape
for network television.'' Some advertisers, he said, ``will not
advertise in any show that has water in it, or it has certain cars
in it that are offensive to them.''
   Advertiser boycotts don't become tantamount to censorship,
LeMasters said, unless the network bows to the pressure. Of
controversial shows, he said, ``I plan to continue to broadcast
them. That is our ultimate statement.''
   CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer sees advertiser
sensitivity as part of a larger viewer ``revolt'' against sexually
explicit or violent fare.
   ``The message to the creative community is again that taste,
albeit difficult to define, still revolves around quality, and that
the audience is smarter at that then you tend to think,'' he said.
   ``We can defend ourselves when we put something on the air that's
really worth defending. And some of the sitcoms in which (sex) is a
one-track theme, alienate the viewers.''
   NBC President and Chief Executive Officer Robert C. Wright, a
former GE executive, said advertisers are simply responding to
consumer desires and don't have any sinister intent to censor what's
on the airwaves.
   ``They scare off real easy when it comes to ... having their
company's name associated with something, even though it might not
have any real impact. What I have been trying to do is get them to
focus in on that and say, listen, investigate the real facts. Try to
make a more informed opinion.''
   The networks believe that allowing advertisers to pre-screen
shows will help educate them. But at a meeting of television critics
this summer, concern was voiced that pre-screening would be an even
bigger step toward censorship.
   No, say the network executives. Advertisers will see completed
shows and those will go on the air regardless of their reaction.
They hope pre-screening will let advertisers make an informed
decision and counteract any biased information from special-interest
groups.
   ``Overall, I think they (advertisers) have pretty strong feelings
on their own, and they don't need any help from the outside,'' said
ABC President John Sias. ``When they do make a decision, obviously,
it's in the interest of third parties who want this to make it
appear that that pressure has been primarily responsible for it.''
   At the critics meeting, Terry Rakolta, the Michigan housewife who
organized a boycott of the hilarious but admittedly often tasteless
Fox comedy ``Married ... With Children'' had backed off some of her
earlier criticisms and now advocates policing the airwaves only
during ``family'' viewing hours.
   ``What we're saying is self-regulate,'' she said. ``You know the
boundaries. We're not in the line-drawing business. You draw the
line.''
   The networks apparently plan to do that.
   Tartikoff told the critics, ``I do think there were some
instances, as I'm sure, having read a lot of your individual
columns, you felt, too, that there was some line-crossing and some
shows that were ill-advised to have been broadcast in the form that
they were, and we've recognized that.''
   Stringer said the bottom line is, as always, viewer discretion.
``I have a sort of vague feeling that censorship, like charity,
should begin at home, but unlike charity, should stay there.''

<HEAD>Antidote to the Networks? Try A Dose of PBS</HEAD>

   It's really easy. It really is. Just turn the
channel. Press the remote a few times. There. See, it's PBS. It
won't hurt you.
   It's almost like real TV, listed there in the television guide
along with all the garbage on commercial TV. Sure, there are a few
good network shows and there's some decent stuff on cable but you've
rented all the worthwhile videos, and after a steady diet of
``Rambo'' and ``Charles in Charge'' you feel kind of grimy, vaguely
out of sorts. It's time for a dose of PBS.
   Think of it as oat bran for the mind.
   Agreed, there may not be the BBC blockbusters of seasons past,
and how many of us really need to know how to restore an
18th-century farmhouse? But there will be some incredible gems, like
Bill Moyers' interviews with the late mythologist and storyteller
Joseph Campbell, or a brilliant work of fiction, such as ``A Very
British Coup.''
   Here are some programs to choose from, circle in the TV Guide,
and watch. Every remote control can be trained to find the PBS
channel.
   Moyers has a new series this season, on contemporary poetry,
promising to make an esoteric subject more accessible to average
viewers. Think how impressed the folks around the water cooler will
be.
   When some bozo is talking about ``Rescue 911,'' you can wax
erudite, talking about ``Travels'' a 12-parter following sojourners
on unusual treks, such as an American comedian's tour of the Soviet
Union and a motorcyclist's trip across China.
   If ``Art of the Western World'' sounds like a college course, it
is. The series, filmed on location in 10 countries, examines the
development of Western art from classical Greek and Roman works to
20th-century masters. It is being offered as a college-level course
by the PBS Adult Learning Service. You didn't pay attention to this
stuff in school and wish you had. Here's a second chance.
   ``America's Century'' is a six-part examination of American
foreign policy in the 20th century. Great stuff for wowing the
cocktail party crowd.
   So is Moyers' other series, ``The Public Mind,'' a four-part
discussion of how news, politics, advertising and business are
evolving to meet the demands of an increasingly image-obsessed
culture. It's ironic you're only watching to impress someone.
   Remember all those great old network documentaries? They were
like pieces on ``60 Minutes,'' except longer. Those are on PBS now.
This season they're on the Palestinian uprising, AIDS and the high
cost of growing old, the latter a special anchored by Walter
Cronkite.
   Other documentaries focus on people, from C. Everett Koop to
Harold Lloyd.
   ``The American Experience'' is back. It's an anthology of
documentaries about various chapters in American history. Also back
is ``Trying Times,'' like a sitcom, only funnier and smarter.
   And look at this season's stars: Geena Davis, Peter Riegert,
Carrie Fisher, Judge Reinhold and Stockard Channing.
   The venerable ``Great Performances'' will present new productions
of ``Showboat'' and ``Our Town.''
   ``Masterpiece Theatre'' offers what promises to be a great
miniseries of ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' the one you bought the
Classic Comic to instead of reading the assignment. Now you realize
it was a great book. Here's a chance to see the motion picture.
   Two ongoing series have new hosts. (You need to know this in case
you talk to a longtime PBS viewer.) Diana Rigg takes over from
Vincent Price on ``Mystery!'' and Stephen Thomas takes over from Bob
Vilas on ``This Old House.'' That's the home repair and restoration
show that inexplicably fascinates you on lazy Saturday afternoons.
   To welcome the newcomers, PBS even has a new logo, an animated,
crystalized version of that ``everyman'' face in the PBS ``P.''
   So there it is. You might not want to watch everything, but
there's bound to be something there for every viewer.
   ABC has a comedy about a witch, for Pete's sake. You're going to
have to find something to watch, right? Might as well be PBS.
   Go on. It's like jumping into the water. There's that initial
shock, but then you get used to it. Pay yourself a dollar for every
hour you watch, or pay PBS. You might find you'll want to.

   ABC's ``Homeroom'' borrows heavily from other
schoolroom comedies but adds nothing new, other than making its
protagonist black.
   This is a lot of ``Welcome Back, Kotter,'' only not as funny, and
a little ``Head of the Class.'' Just to make sure no originality
sneaks in, the plot of the pilot is heavily inspired by the movie
``Stand and Deliver.''
   Darryl Sivad, a likable sort, stars as Darryl Hudson, who gave up
a successful advertising career to teach inner-city fourth-graders.
Penny Johnson plays Vicki, Darryl's loving wife, who is studying to
become a doctor.
   Conflict is provided Hudson's father, Phil, who is also their
landlord. He is played by the fine Bill Cobbs (``The `Slap' Maxwell
Story''), who thinks his son-in-law has taken leave of his senses to
give up lucrative jingle-writing to try to teach math to juvenile
delinquents.
   ``Homeroom'' is on Sunday, facing tough competition from CBS'
``Murder, She Wrote'' and NBC sitcoms.
   Executive producer and creator Gary Gilbert was a producer-writer
on ``Head of the Class,'' but with laugh lines like, ``Sue me!''
``Homeroom'' flunks.

   The producers of the uninspired but
inoffensive sitcom ``The Hogan Family'' on NBC have a new uninspired
but inoffensive sitcom on ABC. ``Family Matters'' is spun off the
elevator operator from ``Perfect Strangers.''
   It is paired on Friday night with Thomas L. Miller and Robert L.
Boyett's other sitcom, the uninspired but inoffensive ``Full House.''
   Do we detect a trend here?
   ``Family Matters'' centers on wise-cracking Harriette Winslow
(JoMarie Payton-France) and her husband, Carl (Reginald VelJohnson).
He is cop who is none too pleased when his wise-cracking mother
(Rosetta Le Noire) comes to live with the already extended family.
   The others include Harriette's sister, Rachel (Telma Hopkins), a
would-be novelist with an infant son; and the Winslows' two
teen-agers and younger daughter.
   The pilot involves a controversy about teen-age Edward's curfew
and Grandma's attempts to impose her rule on the household, with
predictable results.
   VelJohnson _ he played the sympathetic cop who talked to Bruce
Willis throughout ``Die Hard'' _ is no Cosby, but he's a strong
father figure. Beyond that, ``Family Matters'' doesn't.

<TEXT>
   The best new comedy of the season is CBS'
``The Famous Teddy Z,'' a fortuitous pairing of producer Hugh Wilson
(``Frank's Place'') and teen-film star Jon Cryer (``Pretty in
Pink'').
   Cryer plays Teddy Zakalokis, a mailroom clerk in the huge
Unlimited Talent Agency who is suddenly thrust into the thick of
show business. When he is sent on a gofer assignment, picking up an
eccentric, Brando-like star at the airport, he winds up punching out
the actor, impressing the guy so much he makes Teddy his agent.
   In-jokes abound, and viewers will delight at being in on them.
   Like Wilson's other comedies (he also did ``WKRP in
Cincinnati''), the supporting characters are as well drawn as the
lead.
   At a television critics meeting this summer, the critics were
going around quoting Al Floss (Alex Rocco), Wilson's quintessential
big-time agent. Floss to secretary: ``What are you, a statue? Screen
the people who come in here!''
   ``Teddy Z'' is well-placed on Monday between ``Murphy Brown'' and
``Designing Women.''
   The only time the comedy drags is when Teddy goes home to his
little Greek ``granny'' and younger brother, Ari. But future plots
sound promising. Teddy gets a new client, a monkey who has been
bounced from a hit network sitcom.
   ``Teddy Z'' is sophisticated fun and everybody in it deserves to
be famous.

   CBS' ``Major Dad'' isn't uniformly funny _ pun
intended _ but it does deserve a salute.
   The bankable Gerald McRaney (``Simon &amp; Simon'') stars as Marine
Maj. J.D. ``Mac'' MacGillis. He has a simple Marine philosophy:
``See the hill, take the hill.'' That's how he manages to woo and
win a bride in one 30-minute pilot.
   She is Polly Cooper, a liberal-thinking newspaper reporter with
three daughters, and is played by newcomer Shanna Reed. The
chemistry between Reed and McRaney and the natural setting for comic
conflict bodes well for a long tour of duty.
   ``Major Dad'' has a tough assignment, leading off CBS' Monday
lineup of comedies. But as Mac says, ``See the hill, take the hill.''

   The weak link in CBS' Monday comedy lineup is
the new ``The People Next Door,'' a rare example of too much of a
mediocre thing.
   This special-effects sitcom is about a cartoonist named Walter
Kellogg (Jeffrey Jones) whose imagination becomes reality, producing
visions of talking moose, buzzing airplanes and giant green monsters
other people can see, too.
   There's also a complex sitcom family who are as unfunny as
Walter's creations are weird.
   Walter is about to wed Abigail (Mary Gross) and has moved into
her small-town home where she lives with her crotchety sister
(Christina Pickles), their mother's ashes and Abigail's psychiatry
practice.
   There's more. Walter has two children, a teen-age son and a
daughter, whose alleged overbite supplies most of the attempted
laugh lines in the pilot.
   There are some cute moments in ``People Next Door.'' Steve Allen
does a cameo as one of Walter's imaginings, arriving with grand
piano to croon ``Imagination Is Funny.'' And Geraldo Rivera pops up
on a TV screen, intoning a promo for a show on ``Men with overactive
imaginations _ and the women who love them.'' Walter then envisions
the set exploding.
   The gimmickry can't long carry an unfunny sitcom _ hey, didn't
somebody say the same thing when ``ALF'' premiered? Nevertheless,
expect ``The People Next Door'' to be moving soon.

   ABC's ``Life Goes On'' is the best family
drama since ``thirtysomething,'' though its style is of the more
traditional ``Family.''
   The title comes from the Beatles song, ``Obla-di, Obla-da,'' and
is the reigning philosophy of the Thachers, a middle-class family
struggling to make ends meet.
   The show is getting a lot of attention because one of its cast
members is Christopher Burke, an actor with Down's syndrome who
plays teen-age son Corky.
   Much of the pilot plot revolves around Corky's challenge, to
``mainstream'' with kids at a regular school, including his younger
sister.
   Patti LuPone (``Evita'') is a surprise as TV mom Libby Thacher,
but she is well cast, as is Bill Smitrovich (``Crime Story'') who
plays her husband, Drew.
   Kellie Martin plays Becca, a perpetually embarrassed
eighth-grader apalled at having to attend junior high school with
her brother. Monique Lanier plays Paige, Drew's daughter from a
previous marriage. She has broken up with her boyfriend and been
forced to move back home.
   The pilot is funny and poignant, nicely written by executive
producer Michael Braverman. In the pilot, Drew is trying to come up
with the money to buy into a construction company. It would help a
lot if he could depend on the extra $5,000 a year the family will
save on Corky's tuition _ IF Corky can make it in a regular, public
junior high school.
   Meanwhile, Libby is facing her 40th birthday and Paige is trying
to figure what she's doing with her life, while Becca learns that
Corky might not be such a bad addition to the social whirl at school
when he immediately befriends the football star.
   ``Life Goes On'' goes into a tough Sunday time period, opposite
CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' Still, that means ABC isn't expecting its
ratings to go through the roof, so it might get to stay around for a
while. And it will get a head start when the pilot is aired a second
time after the hit ``Roseanne.''
   This is a nice show with a lot of heart that deserves to go on
and on.

   There's nothing wrong with CBS' new crime
drama ``Wolf,'' but there's nothing particularly right about it,
either.
   It's ``Rockford Files'' without the humor, ``Wiseguy'' without
the offbeatness, ``Miami Vice'' without the style.
   Jack Scalia plays an Italian-American former cop who was busted
from the force after he was framed. He reunites with his old-country
father, Sal (Joseph Sirola), and buys a fishing boat. A chance to
work as a private eye gives him the opportunity to clear his name.
   The pilot is competent but there's no compelling reason to watch
``Wolf,'' except for the San Francisco setting.
   The series probably won't be around long. It has drawn a Tuesday
time period opposite NBC's ``In the Heat of the Night'' and ABC's
hit ``Roseanne.''
   Expect ``Wolf'' to whimper off soon into the Nielsen woods.

   With ``Miami Vice'' and ``Simon &amp; Simon''
gone, we're in desperate need of a new buddy-cops show.
   NBC to the rescue with ``Hardball,'' replacing ``Miami Vice'' on
Friday.
   So what if this is a worn, old premise. It works when it's done
right, and it's done right in ``Hardball.'' This time we have the
engaging pairing of balding tough guy Charlie Battles (John Ashton)
with Joe ``Kaz'' Kaczierowski (Richard Tyson), a hunk with long hair
and a Harley.
   We know the drill. These two misfits are partners. Battles
doesn't like anything about Kaz, his hair, his name, his attitude.
Kaz is merely amused. Of course, when the chips are down, Kaz will
prove his worth and eventually he and Charlie will form a grudging
friendship.
   Producer Frank Lupo is a former partner of Stephen J. Cannell in
``Hunter'' for NBC.
   ``Hardball'' joins an all-new lineup on Friday night, the only
night of the week where No. 1 NBC still has problems and has been
rotating series trying to find something that will stick.
``Hardball'' could be a keeper.

   LOS ANGELES (A) _ The pilot for ``Top of the Hill'' has been
kicking around so long one of the actors has died and another is in
another network's sitcom.
   Finally, CBS bought it from Stephen J. Cannell (``Wiseguy,''
``Hunter'').
   ``Top of the Hill,'' its name wisely changed from ``Lame Duck,''
tests credibility by creating a hero who is a crusading congressman.
But we are being cynical. Even in this age of Capitol Hill scandals
of the week, there are some heroes in Washington. Cannell's Tom Bell
is inspired by an older example, Rep. Leo Ryan of California, who
was killed while investigating the Jonestown cult.
   William Katt (``Greatest American Hero'') plays Bell, a
36-year-old surfer elected to fill out the term of his ailing
father, Thomas ``Pat'' Bell Sr. (Dick O'Neill).
   At the hands of a veteran House leader, played in the pilot by
the late Kenneth MacMillan, Bell learns he has to play ball to get
anything done for his constituency. Corinne Bohrer, who is playing a
witch in the new ABC sitcom ``Free Spirit,'' was the love interest.
   Much of the pilot is taken up with explaining how Congress works
until that becomes tedious and Bell segues into a clone of Sonny
Crockett and heads for a fictional Latin American country to do
battle with drug lords. He's a little slow at this at first. He
tells them he has diplomatic immunity.
   Bell takes on this mission to search for the missing son of a
constituent, who had been scouring Washington for help.
   ``Top of the Hill'' goes into a forget-it time period on Thursday
opposite NBC's comedies, so don't expect Congressman Bell to get
re-elected.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KILCULLEN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anthony J.F. O'Reilly is best-known in
international business circles as chairman and chief executive of
H.J. Heinz Co., the food giant famous for ketchup, baked beans and
pickles.
   But in his native land he's Tony O'Reilly, eminent Irishman.
   ``I'm very comfortable with my Irishness, and very proud of it,''
says O'Reilly, 53, multimillionaire, philanthropist, rugby hero,
lawyer, agriculturalist, publisher, campaigner for peace in Northern
Ireland and symbol of Ireland's transformation from rural backwater
to modern industrial society.
   ``I see myself as a manager in the world of Heinz,'' he says. ``I
see myself in Ireland as an innovator, a creator, a pacifier.''
   Having worked in the United States for 18 years, he is considered
one of Ireland's most successful expatriates.
   O'Reilly is not universally adored in Ireland, perhaps partly
because of what The Financial Times calls ``old-fashioned Irish
begrudgery,'' exacerbated by O'Reilly's flashy life.
   ``Small countries don't like tall poppies,'' O'Reilly says. ``I
think I've hardened against that.''
   He spoke during an interview in the drawing room of Castlemartin,
his 28-room Georgian manor. It overlooks the meandering River Liffey
and paddocks where his white Charolais cattle and bay and brown
racehorses graze.
   The 500-acre estate lies 30 miles south of Dublin in County
Kildare, and is green, of course.
   ``This is the center,'' says O'Reilly, who also owns houses in
western Cork, and near Heinz's Pittsburgh headquarters. ``It clearly
is my spiritual home. The rhythm of life, I get from Ireland.''
   O'Reilly retains his Irish citizenship and accent, and
occasionally speaks Irish ``to confuse the enemy.'' He usually
spends a weekend a month in Ireland, typically continuing on to
Europe or Africa on Heinz business. He vacations in Ireland, and
says he intends to return here to live out his life.
   Wherever he is, O'Reilly calls the managers of his Irish
investments daily.
   He is 6-feet-2 and struggles with his weight. Silver-haired and
ruddy, he is a dapper dresser who likes to splash on the cologne.
   He is hospitable and likes to joke. After meeting Robert Mugabe,
the Marxist leader of Zimbabwe, O'Reilly told him: ``We're both
students of Marx. You of Karl, and me of Groucho.''
   Like any good Irishman, he constantly refers to the island's
great writers, and believes luck has contributed to his success.
   ``The thing I dislike most about Ireland is the absolute tyranny
with which history is imposed today, this reaching back to history
as a guide to the future. It's a straitjacket,'' he said.
   He was referring to the Irish Republican Army's guerrilla war to
rid Northern Ireland of British rule and unite the province with the
republic.
   ``We are not for that,'' said O'Reilly, a Roman Catholic who
believes in the non-violent unification of Ireland. ``I consider the
terrorist divide to be one of the great stains on Irish history.
   ``I do believe that the unification of Ireland is not worth
shedding one drop of blood.''
   In 1976 O'Reilly founded the Ireland Fund, a charity that has
raised millions of dollars in United States for solving social
problems caused by the fighting in Northern Ireland. Similar funds
operate in Canada, Australia and Britain. He chairs them all.
   O'Reilly denies persistent speculation that his goal is a
political career, and has rejected an offer to serve as Ireland's
agriculture minister.
   Still, he has strong opinions on Irish issues. He says Ireland's
high taxes should be cut, and divorce and abortion legalized.
   He also says a successful international businessman is an
``enormously important political role model for the Irish people.''
   O'Reilly is Ireland's biggest newspaper owner, as chairman and
main shareholder of Independent Newspapers PLC, with titles that
include the Irish Independent and tabloid Sunday World.
   He also is chairman of Fitzwilton PLC, a holding company with
interests that range from a retail chain to a sign maker. O'Reilly's
other Irish business ventures include oil prospecter Atlantic
Resources PLC, several hotels and a license to practice law.
   His personal fortune exceeds $100 million, he says.
   O'Reilly says he told Heinz before taking the $4 million-a-year
job that he would not abandon his Irish pursuits.
   ``It was all up front,'' O'Reilly said. ``There's never been a
conflict of interest.''
   O'Reilly was born in Dublin in 1936, the only child of the chief
customs inspector.
   At age 6, O'Reilly attended Belvedere College, an exclusive
Jesuit school where writer James Joyce was educated.
   Within eight months of leaving school at age 18, he had become
one of Ireland's greatest rugby players. His career spanned the
'50s, '60s and '70s, he played 29 internationals for Ireland, and in
1955 set a record for touchdowns scored on tours, which remains
unbroken.
   Enlarged photographs of O'Reilly the rugby player adorn the walls
of his house. He talks about the game constantly, using it as an
analogy for business and life.
   ``It taught me a fervent and never-ending respect for
collegiality. We shared the rewards, we shared the losses.''
   He excelled academically as well. He attended University College
Dublin, where he studied law, and then the University of Bradford,
in England, for a Ph.D. in agriculture.
   O'Reilly became head of the Irish Dairy Board and soon displayed
his marketing abilities by inventing Kerrygold, the internationally
known Irish butter brand name.
   He then managed Irish food companies doing business with Heinz.
The foodmaker's executives were impressed with the young O'Reilly,
and in 1969, they offered him the job of managing director of
Heinz's British operations.
   Within four years, he was president of the entire company, and in
1987, when Henry J. Heinz II died, O'Reilly succeeded him as the
first non-family chairman in the company's 119-year history.
   O'Reilly has energized the $6 billion concern by cutting costs,
tying pay more closely to performance, promoting stock ownership
among employees, and expanding into the faster-growing baby, pet and
diet food industries.
   O'Reilly's rugby-team spirit apparently makes him well-liked
among Heinz's 40,000 employees, and his profit-making talents are
popular with shareholders.
   He loves a party and entertains celebrity friends lavishly, often
with his own singing and piano-playing. He travels on Heinz's
corporate jet and in cigar-equipped luxury cars.
   O'Reilly married Australian-born Susan Cameron, a former concert
pianist, in 1962 and they have six children, including triplets.
   Aside from Irishness, what makes O'Reilly tick?
   ``With the philosophy of `Gee thanks, what have you done for me
today,' I feel myself in a sense of permanent competition with the
world outside,'' he says.
   But, he says, ``There is the constant inherent contradiction of
success and the enjoyment of success.
   ``Here I am in this lovely Celtic setting which I see eight weeks
out of the year, and never leave without regret and a backward
glance.''

   First come the ambassadors of Chad and Niger,
puffing and swinging their arms as they jog around the sports field.
Behind them is the envoy from Togo, sweat pouring down his face.
Bringing up the rear is the ambassador of Burkina Faso, pedaling a
bicycle.
   Just a normal Saturday morning for the diplomats from
French-speaking Africa. They gather at 9, jog for a while, swing
from exercise bars, then get down to a rough-and-tumble soccer match.
   ``Attrape le bal, attrape le bal!'' (catch the ball) screamed His
Excellency Ellom-Kodjo Schuppius of Togo as the ball zoomed to the
edge of the field.
   This time the diplomats were playing against some African
students who generally turn up at the field Saturday mornings. Other
times they just kick the ball around among themselves.
   All week long the diplomats sit behind their desks, hold meetings
and attend receptions. The weekly workout is a chance to sweat the
whiskey and good food out of their systems and keep in shape, they
said.
   But when they discard their formal attire, they are still mindful
of their position. One is wearing a Dior sweat suit, another sports
a Gucci.
   ``We believe in a sound mind in a sound body,'' said Paul-Desire
Kabore, the ambassador of Burkina Faso who acts as dean of the
informal ambassadorial club. The club unites 12 French-speaking
African countries, some of the poorest in the world, who pool their
time and resources to attract U.S. investment and organize projects
to benefit their homelands.
   The others are Benin, Ivory Coast, Congo, Central African
Republic, Mali, Senegal, Rwanda and Guinea.
   The 12 ambassadors are traveling to Denver next month to take
part in a trade and investment fair, and they hope to get a game
together there, possibly with some of the American participants,
Kabore said.
   Ambassadors who are too out of shape to play soccer or jog
sometimes come out on Saturday mornings to watch or walk laps around
the field.
   Ambassador Moumouni Adamou Djermakoye of Niger is an active
participant. In fact, he might be called an over-achiever. In
addition to the weekly match and jogging, he rides his bicycle 13
miles every Sunday and plays basketball.
   He has already held the posts of foreign affairs minister,
minister of health, youth and sports, and served as a regional
governor. He came to Washington a year ago.
   Togo's Schuppius, who has been here six years, also plays tennis
on the weekends and walks everywhere he can. ``It helps me get in
shape, mentally and physically, for the week,'' he said.
   Many ambassadors in Washington have swimming pools and tennis
courts at their residences. Not so most of the Africans, whose
budgets are limited.
   Chad's Mahammat Ali Adoun said he wouldn't know what to do with a
pool, anyway. ``I can't swim. My country is very dry,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, he appears in good shape, tall and well-muscled. ``I
jog several rounds, then I hang on the bars _ have to exercise those
pectorals and abdominals,'' he said. ``At home, it's too hot to
exercise like this.''
   At home, soccer is a national pastime.
   The African students do not appear intimidated by their
distinguished opponents. The soccer game is for fun. No score is
kept of winners or losers. ``Our health is the winner,'' said Kabore.

<HEAD>Another Push Begins to Help Rural America Come Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lot of people say rural America, with its
wide-open spaces and small towns, is in trouble and needs a lift.
   The Senate says a modest infusion of federal funds, around $1.5
billion over five years, is a good place to start. The House is
still working on its rural development plan. The Bush administration
hasn't given details of what it supports, but there are hints.
   ``Establishing a rural development policy requires striking a
balance between long-term strategies to improve rural economies and
shorter term efforts to provide jobs and the infrastructure needed
for long-term development and improved quality of life,'' says
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   However, he adds, national debt ``as the predominant constraint''
on federal spending puts a lid on how much the government can spend
on domestic programs, including rural development.
   ``But even if funding were available, it is not clear that simply
adding programs or funding would be helpful in solving rural
economic problems,'' Yeutter says.
   Rural development for decades has been a goal of every
administration and most office-seekers and farm organizations. Pet
programs have been promoted from time to time, but the national
commitment has been varied and often fuzzy.
   An Agriculture Department task force earlier this year reported
to Yeutter on how to improve USDA's rural development efforts.
Yeutter's comments about ``striking a balance'' and federal spending
were included in the report.
   The rural economy ``has difficulty keeping pace with national
economic growth,'' it said. There are fundamental problems of being
a rural community: small size, isolation, an unskilled work force
and a lack of institutional support.
   ``Cyclical recovery alone will not solve rural America's
problems,'' the task force said. ``Without structural adjustments to
enhance its productive potential, the rural economy will continue to
lag, and many more rural residents will be forced to leave their
hometowns.''
   The task force made a number of recommendations ``within current
budgetary resources and without major organizational restructuring''
to improve the effectiveness of USDA rural programs.
   ``USDA should begin by committing itself to rural development as
a major departmental mission,'' the task force said. ``USDA should
articulate a clear goal for rural development and base its policy
decisions on this goal. It can also take steps to strengthen its
capacity for effective and concerted program action.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee and a long-time supporter of rural
development, saw the Senate give unanimous approval a month ago to
his Rural Partnerships Act of 1989.
   ``Rural America today is in trouble,'' Leahy said. ``Compared to
the nation as a whole, rural unemployment and poverty are higher and
economic opportunities are deteriorating. We cannot have two
Americas _ one, a land of opportunity and a second, rural America _
left behind.''
   Leahy said his bill is aimed at helping rural people, an
estimated 61 million Americans, including farmers, businessmen and
workers, in 14,000 small towns and cities across every state.
   While agriculture is important, only 10 percent of rural
Americans live and work on farms. Leahy said the problems of farmers
will be addressed specifically in the 1990 farm bill and other
initiatives.
   The Rural Partnerships Act would provide federal dollars to be
matched locally to create jobs and economic opportunity through
local revolving funds.
   Through other programs, money would be used to help improve
education and health care. Safe drinking water and waste disposal
would be other objectives sought by the Senate bill.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the House subcommittee
on conservation credit and rural development, held field hearings
this summer and says legislation deserves a high priority.
   English warns, however, that significant new spending in rural
communities will be impossible, given the budget crunch.
   But he says that if programs are targeted, modernized and used to
complement each other, rural communities can be given ``a real
opportunity to prosper.''
   There is some feeling in the House that rural development should
be dealt with in legislation to replace the 1985 farm law, contrary
to Leahy's plan for keeping the two separate.
   Regardless of the maneuvering, there is growing evidence that
rural development as an issue is around to stay.
   An environmental group, Renew America, said last week that
``thousands of miles of streams are polluted, pesticides continue to
seep into groundwater, acid rain is changing the face of the
forests, lakes and farmland, and litter is scattered over the
countryside.''
   In a report about ``communities at risk,'' the group said rural
America is changing and not for the better.
   Wes Jackson of The Land Institute, Salina, Kan., a non-profit
research organization, said in the report's introduction that the
countryside represents ``the vulnerable soft underbelly'' of U.S.
society at large.
   ``The simple reality is that rural people are a dispersed
minority with no political clout, marginal isolates rapidly becoming
like Third World peoples,'' he said. ``And increasingly the
landscapes on which they live take on a Third World appearance.''

   The economy grew at a healthy 2.7 percent
annual rate this spring, far higher than estimated, the government
said in a report viewed as further evidence that the country's
longest peacetime expansion is in no danger of faltering.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that the increase in the
gross national product from April through June was a full percentage
point higher than the anemic 1.7 percent GNP increase originally
estimated a month ago. Most of the new-found strength came in
consumer spending.

advance was led by a giant 55.8 percent jump in sales in the

two of the top makers of expensive graphics minisupercomputers.
   Sources close to the deal said Tuesday that both privately held
companies are losing money and are hoping that by uniting they will
be able to stave off mounting competition from others.

   Walt Disney Co. filed suit against 149 New York
area merchants charging they violated copyright laws by illegally
selling and distributing merchandise bearing Disney characters.
   Disney, which has exclusive rights to its well-known creations _
Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Roger Rabbit and others _
earns more than $100 million a year in royalties from licensing
fees, according to court papers filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn.
   The merchants allegedly sold watches, shirts, dolls, toys and
other products imprinted with Disney characters without obtaining
permission from Disney or paying fees.
   The suit charges ``irreparable harm and damage'' by merchants
selling unauthorized products of inferior quality.
   Disney is seeking at least $1 million in damages and an order to
stop the merchants from producing and selling counterfeit Disney
products.

   Digital Equipment Corp. plans to introduce a new
line of computers this fall that Digital executives hope will give
the company an entry into the mainframe class of computers.
   Analysts said the range of top-of-the-line computers called Vax
9000, and code-named Aquarius, will compete with computers made by
International Business Machines Corp., Uisys Corp., Amdahl Corp.,
Tandem Computers Inc. and others.
   ``They're not quite betting the company on the product, but
they're betting substantial human and financial resources on it,''
said Terry C. Shannon, an analyst with International Data Corp. in
Framingham.
   Digital relies heavily on sales of minicomputers, but that market
is slumping. Wang Laboratories Inc., Data General Corp., Prime
Computer Inc. and others have also been affected by the slowdown.
   Digital's Vax 9000 line will have features that make it
well-suited for processing large numbers of transactions at high
speeds, analysts said.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian bank said that its branch in Atlanta, Ga.,
had been involved in a major financial scandal regarding letters of
credit for exports to Iraq.
   Claudio Cremona, a spokesman for Banca Nazionale del Lavoro,
Italy's largest, state-owned bank, said Tuesday that bank inspectors
had uncovered as many as 2,500 transactions done by its Atlanta
branch which hadn't been authorized by either the bank's North
American management or by the head office in Rome.
   The unauthorized practices, which were confined to the Atlanta
branch, took place during the 12 months before the operation was
discovered in early August, the spokesman said.
   He said the bank had yet to determine the exact amount of money
involved in the scam because ``the auditing is still going on.''
   The investigation was made more difficult by the sophisticated
methods used to keep the transactions off the official books, he
said.
   Cremona said the letters of credit, while correct technically,
exceeded the credit ceiling that Banca Nazionale set for the branch.
He couldn't say by how much the branch had surpassed its credit
limit.

<HEAD>Gas Chambers, Blitzkriegs Poor Backdrop For Certain Ads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese and West German companies that
ordinarily advertise in weekly news magazines apparently don't want
their products associated with memories of blitzkriegs, gas chambers
and death marches.
   Time magazine and U.S. News &amp; World Report said Tuesday that some
advertisers pulled ads out of their special issues on the 50th
anniversary of the outbreak of World War II.
   Time and U.S. News declined to identify the advertisers. But the
World War II issues were noticeably lacking in ads from Japanese
companies, which are heavy advertisers in the magazines.
   Newsweek magazine, whose special World War II coverage was
limited to slightly more than two pages of book reviews in its Sept.
4 issue, had a normal amount of advertising from Japanese companies
in the issue.
   West German companies do not advertise every week in any of the
three newsweeklies, so it is difficult to determine whether any had
pulled ads because of the cover stories in Time and U.S. News.
   Some of the ads that were pulled were switched to other issues of
the magazines, said spokesmen for the magazines.
   ``The net of it was that we did lose some business,'' Time
spokesman Brian Brown said.
   Spokesmen for Japan's Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.'s
Infiniti division and Honda Motor Co. Ltd.'s Acura division, which
frequently advertise in the magazines, said Tuesday that their
absence from the World War II editions had nothing to do with the
magazines' contents.
   Newsweeklies often notify advertisers when they plan articles
that might embarrass them. For example, if a magazine is running a
cover story on alcoholism it would warn liquor companies.
   ``We make it very clear that the story is going to run in any
case, and I think that speaks well for editorial integrity,'' Brown
said.
   U.S. News has a similar policy, spokeswoman Beth Kseniak said.
   U.S. News has no ads from Japanese or West German companies in
its Aug. 28-Sept. 4 double issue featuring stories on World War II.
Time's Aug. 28 issue on World War II carries a single Japanese ad, a
two-page spread from Japan's Pioneer Electronics (U.S.A.) Inc.
   Japanese and West German advertisers are entirely absent from
Time's Sept. 4 issue, which has 17 pages about World War II and a
small headline, or ``flag,'' about the special section at the top of
the cover.
   Newsweek's Aug. 28 issue has 10 pages of advertising from
Japanese companies and some small ads from West German companies,
which are in an advertising supplement by the nation of Nigeria. Its
Sept. 4 issue, which contains the World War II book reviews, has 10
pages of Japanese advertising.
   Volkswagen USA ran a one-page ad in the Aug. 21 issue of Time but
the German company did not have anything scheduled for the Aug. 28
issues of Time or U.S. News, regardless of the contents of those
issues, said marketing director William Gelgota.
   Nissan's Infiniti division, which is gearing up for the launch of
its new luxury car, ran no ads in Time and U.S. News but had a
four-page spread in the Aug. 28 Newsweek.
   Honda's Acura division placed three-page ads in the Aug. 21
issues of Time and U.S. News but nothing in the World War II issues.
It has a two-page ad in the Aug. 28 Newsweek.
   Toyota ran a one-page ad in the Aug. 21 Time and had the back
cover of the Aug. 21 U.S. News, but was absent from the World War II
issues.
   World War II began Sept. 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland.
Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later. The
United States entered after being attacked by Japan on Dec. 7, 1941.

<HEAD>CFTC Proposes Tighter Surveillance, Rule Changes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators, as promised following the
indictment of 46 futures brokers and traders, have come up with a
package of reforms and now want to hear what the industry thinks.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the
futures industry, voted unanimously Tuesday to submit the proposed
rules changes for public comment.
   The reform package, which includes increased surveillance on
commodities exchange floors at the start and end of trading days,
was proposed after 46 brokers and traders in Chicago's futures
exchanges were indicted Aug. 2 on fraud and racketeering charges.
   Those charges, stemming from a lengthy undercover federal probe
of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade,
included allegations that traders cheated their customers through
falsified records and pre-arranged trades.
   ``We support their efforts to address these issues,'' said Andrew
A. Yemma, a spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ``After a
thorough review process earlier this year, our own board of
governors approved a comprehensive set of rule enhancements that are
very similar to what the CFTC proposed today.''
   BOT President and Chief Executive Officer Tom Donovan said in a
statement, ``We have not yet reviewed the CFTC's new and proposed
rules; however it appears that many of the recommendations are
either already in place at the Chicago Board of Trade or will soon
be implemented.''
   The markets themselves have proposed tighter trading rules and
updated surveillance and auditing techniques to combat abuse.
   Yemma noted that both exchanges announced plans to develop an
electronic surveillance system that will use hand-held computer
terminals in the trading pits.
   He said the exchanges hope to have the new system developed
within a year and ``with the adoption of these measures, we are
confident that opportunities for the types of abuses raised in the
indictments will be effectively eliminated.''
   Critics have claimed the traditional ``open outcry'' system of
trading, in which participants use shouts and hand signals to make
transactions in crowded, hectic trading pits, makes it difficult to
track and detect fraud.
   ``The commission is committed to take all necessary steps to
protect the public confidence in these markets,'' said CFTC
Chairwoman Wendy Gramm. ``The action we are taking today will
reinforce our regulatory system.''
   The Chicago charges alleged that traders cheated customers by
falsifying trading cards, which record purchase and sales
information, or altering the time that trades were made to take
advantage of price shifts in the market.
   Some brokers allegedly conspired with exchange members who trade
only for their own accounts, known as locals, to finalize trades
after the close of the market in order to illegally try to set a
more advantageous price.
   In addition to tightening surveillance on the nation's commodity
exchange floors, the package calls for:
   _Easily identifiable trading cards with preprinted information
that would allow regulators to reconstruct the sequence of a trade,
an investigative practice known as following the audit trail.
   _Frequent collection, at least every 30 minutes and eventually
every 15 minutes, of trading cards to reduce the potential for
altering records to conceal illegal trading activity.
   _Preventing people with histories of rules violations from
serving on the governing boards, disciplinary committees or
arbitration panels of exchanges or registered futures associations.
   ``All of these changes will help detect but also deter'' illegal
trading, said Mrs. Gramm after the commission vote.
   The CFTC's proposed changes are subject to comment by interested
parties for the next 30 to 60 days before the commission can make
its approval final.
   One element put into effect immediately was the creation of a
pilot surveillance program. The Floor Surveillance Task Force will
have responsibility for direct examination of trading cards and
other trading records on the exchange floor.
   The pilot program is designed to enable the commission to
determine its needs for a permanent floor surveillance program in
the near future.

   Some major drug companies in effect said ``I
told you so'' at the latest news of a troubled generic drug maker,
but added that it was too early to tell the scope of problems among
their Brand X rivals.
   ``You might expect that problems would eventuate,'' said
Warner-Lambert Co. spokesman Peter Wolf in Morris Plains. Generic
drug companies don't have ``quite the same understanding of the
long-term commitment to research integrity,'' he said Tuesday.
   Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. is ``concerned about the recent findings
because they question the reliability of some generic drugs,'' said
Paul Oestreicher, spokesman for the Nutley-based company. ``It's a
serious issue.''
   The Food and Drug Administration moved Monday to withdraw from
the market a popular generic high-blood pressure medicine made by
Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc. It was the third such action aimed at
a generic company in a week, shaking the $5-billion-a-year industry.
   The FDA is investigating 11 drug makers following allegations of
fraud and corruption involving employees of the agency's generic
drug section and some generic drug companies.
   Generic drugs duplicate brand-name products whose patents have
expired, and can cost up to 70 percent less.
   Some major drug makers also produce generic medicines, often
versions of their own drugs whose patents expired.
   Other research-oriented pharmaceutical companies contacted
Tuesday stayed out of the fray.
   ``We're not in the generic business and we're going to pass on
this one,'' said Ronald Asinari, spokesman for Schering-Plough Corp.
of Madison.
   Nor would Merck &amp; Co. spokeswoman Cindy Zarsky comment, though
she did point out that the Rahway-based company's research and
development budget for 1989 was $750 million.
   ``Our response to generic competition is we will continue to
discover and develop innovative medicines,'' she said.
   Many of the companies said it was too early too tell how
widespread problems were among the generics, or whether the
brand-name companies would be affected.
   ``I think we're all waiting holding our breath, hoping that it
isn't more widespread, because ultimately in the public perception
it affects the whole industry,'' Wolf said.
   Analysts doubted the problems at generic drug makers would change
their big brothers' strategy about entering or leaving the generic
market, or make a difference to their bottom line.
   Analysts noted that the major profits in the research-driven drug
business come from patented drugs.

<HEAD>NLRB Orders New Training Following Right to Work Committee Study</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Labor Relations Board has ordered
its regional offices to provide new training to employees who handle
inquiries about workers' rights, a move stemming from a study by an
anti-union group that said the NLRB often provided inaccurate
information.
   ``Please schedule additional training for all staff professionals
who serve as information officers and ensure that only those who
possess a sufficient level of experience are assigned to serve as
information officers,'' William G. Stack, the NLRB's acting
associate general counsel, said in a memo sent earlier this month to
the agency's field directors.
   Stack also told the regional offices to determine whether NLRB
officers quoted in a recent report by the National Right to Work
Committee had in fact provided the information attributed to them in
the anti-union group's report.
   Stack declined comment when asked whether the NLRB agreed that
some of its information officers had provided inaccurate
information. But when asked why he ordered new training, he said:
``Anytime I find out that there is a need for training, the correct
thing to do is see that the training is conducted.''
   The Right to Work Committee, in a study released this month, said
NLRB information officers often provided inaccurate information when
questioned about employees' rights under a 1988 Supreme Court
decision.
   In the decision, the high court ruled that employees hired by
companies whose workforce is represented by unions cannot be forced
to join the union but can be required to pay dues to help pay the
costs of negotiating and administering contracts. The court said
workers could not be required to pay dues in excess of those amounts
_ in effect allowing workers who disagree with the political
activities of the union that represents them to withhold partial
dues.
   The Right to Work Committee said it hired a private investigator
who telephoned 34 NLRB offices in states that allow compulsory
unionism and claimed to be an employee who had been recently hired
and informed that he had to join a union and pay union dues.
   Information officers at 22 of the offices said workers could be
required to pay full union dues, the group said in its study.
   When the survey was released earlier this month, NLRB spokesman
Dave Parker dismissed its findings and said: ``I would think it
improbable that our field offices would not provide accurate
information to an employee about what rights he has.''
   But the next day, Aug. 10, Stack sent his memo to the regional
directors ordering the additional training and an investigation into
whether the Right to Work Committee's account was accurate. During
the training, Stack said, information officers should be given a
copy of a November 1988 internal NLRB memo outlining the Supreme
Court decision, commonly referred to as the Beck decision after
Harry Beck, the man who sued the Communications Workers of America
for the right to withhold partial dues.

<HEAD>Banking Chairman Will Reopen Probe of Lincoln S&amp;L</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee
says he will reopen his panel's investigation of the failure of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, expected to require the
government's largest-ever thrift rescue.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, branded the collapse of the
thrift based in Irvine, Calif., a ``mini-Watergate.'' He said his
committee had suspended its probe only because of the pressing need
to pass emergency legislation bailing out the savings and loan
industry.
   Now that Congress has passed the bill, Gonzalez vowed to clear up
the scandal ``once and for all.''
   Previously Gonzalez has criticized M. Danny Wall, director of the
Office of Thrift Supervision, for delaying regulatory action against
Lincoln and allowing the thrift's losses to balloon.
   The probe is sure to examine political contributions from Charles
H. Keating Jr., the chairman of Lincoln's parent firm, American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix, to five senators who later met with
regulators about Lincoln.
   They are Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; John Glenn, D-Ohio;
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz., and Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich. Riegle, who is chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, later returned Keating's contribution.
   Lincoln is under the control of the Resolution Trust Corp., the
new agency created earlier this month to rescue and close the
nation's insolvent thrift institutions. Analysts expect that Lincoln
will be the costliest of more than 400 resolutions.
   ``We already know that at least $1.5 billion has been lost in the
Lincoln fiasco with more to come as the mess is cleaned up,''
Gonzalez said in a statement Monday.
   ``Lincoln remains a mini-Watergate in federal financial
regulations and it is important that the public and the Congress
know why it happened and specifically who was responsible,'' he said.
   Gonzalez said the committee will also re-examine the spate of
last-minute S&amp;L rescues conducted by the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board last December. And, he said, the panel will be overseeing the
RTC's disposition of real estate, particularly in Texas, where the
savings and loan problem has been concentrated.

<HEAD>Regulators Urge Quick Decision on Selling Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has urged a
California utility to decide soon whether to sell or dismantle its
Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, which voters said last June should
close.
   Thomas Murley, director of the commission's office of nuclear
reactor regulation, told officials of the Sacramento Municipal
Utility District on Tuesday that uncertainty about the fate of the
913-megawatt plant was making it difficult to plan regulatory
changes there.
   ``It does make it awkward to keep carrying these options for a
long period of time,'' Murley told the officials in a meeting at NRC
headquarters. The unusual circumstances of the plant's forced
shutdown has put it in ``uncharted waters,'' he said.
   Other commission staff members noted, for example, that they may
need to know the plant's fate before deciding whether to approve the
utility's plan for reducing its emergency staff or its request to be
exempted from an on-site emergency exercise.
   The NRC must approve any transfer of the utility district's
nuclear license to another operator, but it also must approve the
various regulatory adjustments required in the event the plant is
decommissioned and eventually dismantled.
   David A. Boggs, general manager of the utility district, assured
Murley and other commission staff members that the question of
whether to sell Rancho Seco would be resolved ``very soon.''
   Boggs said efforts to sell the 15-year-old plant probably will be
abandoned if no agreement is reached by Friday with Quadrex Corp. of
Campbell, Calif.
   ``I do not see anyone else coming forward ... to continue this
process,'' of negotiating to buy the plant, Boggs said, adding later
that he was ``cautiously optimistic'' that a deal could be worked
out this week with Quadrex.
   The Rancho Seco station has been shut down since June 7, the day
after utility district residents voted against keeping the plant
running. It was the first time an operating nuclear power plant was
closed by voter initiative.
   The vote did not explicitly prohibit the utility from selling the
plant, and a buyer such as Quadrex could be allowed to run it if the
NRC approves a license transfer. Under such circumstances, Quadrex
would have to restart the reactor.
   If a deal is struck with Quadrex, and arrangements are set for
the utility to buy back some of the power generated by Rancho Seco,
then the district's board of directors would vote on it Sept. 7,
Boggs said.
   Any proposed sale would be put to a public vote, tentatively
scheduled for Dec. 12.
   Boggs and other officials of the utility also told the NRC they
were offering key workers special severance agreements in order to
keep them from quitting. Licensed operators, for example, are being
assured they will get the equivalent of six months salary in the
event they are laid off _ money they wouldn't get if they resigned.

<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines' new owners should be able
to repay the carrier's $3.1 billion debt with cash from its
operations, including income from sale-leaseback arrangements on
aircraft, congressional auditors say.
   Through 1993, the airline will have at least $635 million a year
left over after servicing its debt and paying taxes, according to an
analysis by the General Accounting Office.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, prepared the report
for the chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, Rep. James
Oberstar, D-Minn., who planned a hearing this fall on the sale of
the airline's parent company, NWA Inc., to a group led by California
investor Alfred Checchi.
   The leveraged buyout will give Northwest one of the highest debt
loads in the industry, and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
is investigating the sale to determine whether it will compromise
the carrier's safety.
   Skinner, who could ground the Eagan, Minn.,-based airline if he
believes it is unsafe, is expected to finish his investigation next
month.
   Checchi filed documents with the Securities and Exchange
Commission saying he expects to repay the carrier's debt through
cash flow from its operations. The GAO report said its analysis
shows the claim ``appears to be true.''
   For 1989, the airline would have $1.8 billion in cash available,
including $364 million in income from operations and $834 million
from selling aircraft and then leasing them back.
   After servicing debt, paying taxes and meeting other expenses,
the airline would have $166 million left over, according to the
report.
   By 1993, the company is projected to have income of $2.1 billion,
including $570 million in revenue from the sale-leaseback
arrangements. After debt payments and other expenses the airline
would have excess cash of $635 million, according to the report.
   The airline could cover any cash shortfalls by selling Japanese
real estate it owns or drawing on a $250 million line of credit, the
GAO said.
   The report confirms what the airline has been saying about the
buyout in public statements and government filings, Kevin Whalen, a
spokesman for the carrier, said Tuesday.
   ``We're committed to continuing to grow the airline, to continue
making it more and more competitive and to handle the debt load
brought on by the purchase in a prudent business manner,'' Whalen
said.
   However, the new debt ``weakens Northwest's financial ratios and
creates lower income due to higher interest payments,'' the GAO said.

   The overseers of the new agency created to
dismantle failed savings institutions have given regulators
permission to get started on big, complex deals.
   But the Resolution Trust Corp. Oversight Board, headed by
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, said Tuesday the overseers
still want to be consulted before regulators give final approval to
complex transactions.
   The policy directive, issued by the oversight board after a
private, telephone conference, was the latest salvo in the
squabbling between bank regulators in charge of handling failed S&amp;Ls
and the administration officials who control the purse strings.
   The law signed by President Bush on Aug. 9 authorized $50 billion
in spending on failed S&amp;Ls and created a two-tier bureaucracy for
handling the work.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., an independent regulatory
agency, got control of the Resolution Trust Corp., or RTC, which is
doing the disposal work.
   But Brady's oversight board, which also includes Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, sets the
policies governing how the $50 billion is to be spent.
   The FDIC has been chafing under the arrangement. Last week, FDIC
Chairman L. William Seidman said regulators have been ready to put
five multi-billion-dollar institutions up for sale, but have had to
delay action, driving up the ultimate cost of the S&amp;L crisis.
   Regulators held off because the oversight board directed them to
complete only relatively simple transactions until it decides,
probably within several weeks, on a policy for disposal techniques
for large institutions.
   So far, the FDIC has closed 11 small S&amp;Ls, transferring their
deposits to other institutions or paying off customers directly. But
it has not tackled the kind of large deals that require the
government to issue guarantees or assume part ownership of a rescued
S&amp;L.
   Oversight board spokesman Art Siddon said the policy was revised
Tuesday to point out that ``simple does not mean small'' and that
regulators can get started on complex deals.
   Members of the congressional banking committees, who are on
vacation until after Labor Day, are expressing concern about the
intramural squabbling, saying they intended that the FDIC would be
able to move swiftly without undue restrictions.
   In a second move, the oversight board told the FDIC to make
disposing of failed S&amp;Ls its first priority. After that, it should
be ready to deploy funds to resolve depositor runs. The third
priority is replacing high-cost deposits with low-cost government
funds.
   The insertion of the second priority effectively replaces
arrangements made early this year under which the Federal Reserve,
Treasury and regional Federal Home Loan Banks agreed jointly to pump
cash into any institutions suffering liquidity problems.

<HEAD>AMR Leads Transportations Stocks Up On Takeover Speculation</HEAD>

   AMR Corp. stock jumped 12 percent on Tuesday as
speculation surfaced that the parent of American Airlines had
retained two investment firms to help defend it against unwanted
takeovers.
   News reports said AMR had retained Salomon Brothers Inc. and
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. to advise the Fort Worth-based company, but AMR
remained mum on the speculation.
   ``We have been directed by senior management not to comment in
any way,'' spokesman Jim Brown said.
   AMR common stock rose $10.25 to close at $91.50 per share in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 3.86
million shares changed hands, the third most active stock traded on
the Big Board Tuesday.
   Other transportation stocks also increased in what analysts said
was anticipation of continued takeover activity in the industry. The
Dow Jones Transportation Average, which includes AMR and six other
airlines in its 20 stocks, finished up 13.69 at 1,506.58, the fourth
consecutive record close.
   UAL Corp., object of $275 per share, or $6.19 billion, takeover
bid by investor Marvin Davis, closed down $4.25 at $277.25, but
other airline companies, including Delta Air Lines Inc., Texas Air
Corp. and Southwest Airlines Co. were up on various exchanges.
   Transportation stocks have been actively traded in the wake of
Davis' bid for UAL, plus the recent buyout of Northwest Airlines
parent NWA Inc by Alfred Checchi.
   ``The latest fad is airline takeovers,'' said Lee Howard, vice
president of Airline Economics Inc., an industry consultant in
Washington, D.C.
   ``They have substantial assets sitting out there which makes them
good takeover targets. You're seeing a continuation of what happened
to Northwest and United,'' Howard said.
   AMR, estimated by some analysts to be worth $114 per share in a
takeover, recently adopted a shareholders rights plan designed to
make a buyout more expensive.
   AMR has reported four straight quarters of record profits, with
second-quarter earnings jumping 25.8 percent to $177.9 million.
   Within the past year, the airline has replaced United as the
nation's No. 1 carrier and has embarked on a multibillion-dollar
expansion program that includes scores of new jets plus a new
maintenance facility and plans for a $1 billion terminal at its base
at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

<HEAD>Federal Express Ads Reflect Global Reach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Express, mapping its foray into
global competition in air cargo transportation, has dropped the
fast-talking, humorous advertising campaign which promised to
deliver packages ``absolutely, positively overnight.''
   The Memphis company that dominates the nation's overnight market
instead has adopted new, documentary-style television commercials
touting safety, reliability and technical expertise.
   The change is part of the company's effort to expand
internationally and become the world's leading transportation
company.
   Federal Express merged on Aug. 7 with international air freight
carrier Flying Tigers, through which it acquired an air cargo
network of 119 countries.
   Analysts say the Flying Tiger acquisition has given Federal
Express two sets of customers: businesses to which it sells services
directly, and freight forwards, which buy services for resale to
shippers. Flying Tigers sold its heavy freight service primarily
through freight forwarders.
   And the analysts say a change in the company's advertising
approach is only natural given Federal Express' expanded clientele.
   ``You are not going to sell the heavyweight business the same way
you sell an overnight letter,'' said David Guthrie, an analyst with
Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. in Memphis.
   ``With an overnight letter, you are dealing with an individual
who may be relatively unsophisticated. Someone shipping heavy
freight is going to be sophisticated. I don't think you are going to
sell to those kind of people with a funny ad,'' Guthrie said.
   David Shoenfeld, vice president of international marketing for
Federal Express, said the company's marketing focus will continue to
shift from next-day delivery to reliability.
   ```Absolutely, positively overnight' really is not a message
that's available to us internationally simply because some things
just can't be overnight,'' Shoenfeld said.
   Shoenfeld cites one selling point as the fact that Federal
Express flies its own aircraft to 30 international airports instead
of relying primarily on cargo space in passenger airlines as
competitors do.
   ``When all of the integration has taken place ... I think we will
see Federal Express become the global standard,'' he said.
   Federal Express, as a newcomer in the heavyweight freight
business, faces stiff competition from a host of new competitors
including Japan Air Lines and Lufthansa German Airlines.
   Its U.S. arch-rival, United Parcel Service, announced on Monday
plans to expand its package delivery service to 175 countries and
territories. It also is planning a new ad campaign promoting its
worldwide service.

<HEAD>Canadian Partnership Raises Hostile Bid in Dunkin' Donuts Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian partnership has raised its hostile bid
for Dunkin' Donuts Inc. to $308 million despite a lawsuit pending in
Delaware Chancery Court, officials said.
   Kingsbridge Capital Group and Cara Operations Ltd. officials,
partners in DD Acquisition Corp., said Tuesday they had raised their
bid from $43 to $45 a share, regardless of how the Delaware judge
rules in the trial that begins Sept. 11.
   Unless extended, the offer expires Sept. 15, the Toronto-based
partnership said.
   ``The offer is there and isn't contingent on success in court,''
said Eric W. Evans, a Kingsbridge associate director.
   He said DD Acquisition would continue its bid if the court finds
Dunkin' Donuts was within its rights when it set up a series of
tough defenses, including an employee stock ownership plan, which
holds about 16 percent of its outstanding common shares.
   The company also has a shareholder rights plan, or ``poison
pill,'' designed to increase the number of shares in the event of a
takeover, making a merger prohibitively expensive.
   And it has sold $28 million of preferred stock, convertible to an
11 percent stake in the company, to an avowedly friendly investor,
General Electric Capital Corp.
   ``We think we have a very good case in court and that the court
will find that those measures were improperly put in place. But even
if they weren't, we'll still continue with the bid,'' Evans said.
   He said the offer was, however, valid only if 50.1 percent of
Dunkin' Donuts' common shares were tendered on a fully diluted basis.
   The board of directors at Dunkin' Donuts said in a prepared
statement Tuesday that a meeting ``to evaluate the revised tender
offer with the assistance of the company's outside legal and
financial advisors'' would be scheduled. The company urged
stockholders not to act until officials had made their
recommendation.
   ``Based on publicly available financial information on Dunkin'
Donuts, including its results for the most recent quarter, we
believe this revised offer is generous and fair,'' Earl I. Rotman,
president of Kingsbridge, said in a prepared statement.
   Dunkin' Donuts reported a 34 percent drop in third-quarter
earnings, much of which it attributed to costs associated with
battling the hostile takeover.
   The doughnut shop chain reported earnings for the three months
ended July 29 of $2.1 million or 24 cents a share on revenue of
$30.3 million, compared with earnings of $3.2 million or 49 cents a
share on revenue of $29.2 million.
   For the nine months ended July 29, Dunkin' Donuts reported
earnings totaled $7.62 million or $1.08 a share on revenue of $89.7
million, down 22.7 percent from $9.86 million or $1.49 a share on
revenue of $82.4 million for the same period a year ago.

<HEAD>Consumers Apparently Still Have Confidence in Generics</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs grafs 4-5, Disclosures of, with new grafs 4-8 to include
FDA commissioner's remarks.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocates and physicians say there's
no reason to doubt the safety and effectiveness of most generic
drugs, and consumers appear to be heeding that advice.
   ``I don't think there's panic in the streets. I think they're
concerned,'' said Harold Cohen, editor of the trade publication Drug
Store News-Inside Pharmacy, referring to drug consumers.
   Cohen, who has been visiting pharmacies in St. Louis, Phoenix and
Washington D.C. for the past week, said Monday he saw few customers
switching from a generic to a brand-name drug.
   ``As far as we know there is no problem with safety at this time
and no problem that is one that would make people stop taking
generic drugs,'' Dr. Frank Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration, said today.
   ``If you are concerned, see your physician, but don't switch
without really checking with someone first,'' he said on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   Disclosures of fraud and corruption in the FDA's generic drug
division have tainted the agency's reputation and cast doubts on the
industry as well as the safety and efficacy of generic medicines.
   ``We are just as shocked, dismayed and angry as I think consumers
are with the despicable events that were perpetrated by a few
generic companies,'' Young said, adding that ``we're not going to
rest until this is cleaned up.''
   Young's assurances of the safety of generics echoed those of
other physicians and consumer advocates.
   ``At the present time, there's no evidence that any generic drugs
out there in the pharmacies lack safety or effectiveness,'' said Dr.
Sidney Wolfe, head of the Public Citizen Health Research Group.
   Dr. Ray W. Gifford, a trustee of the American Medical Association
who is also an internist at the Cleveland Clinic and a clinical
pharmacologist, agreed.
   ``What we've seen in the past few weeks is regrettable, but I
don't think it reflects all generics and it really hasn't changed my
prescribing habits,'' he said.
   However, Gifford said, most physicians already insist on
brand-name drugs for certain hard-to-treat conditions, such as
congestive heart failure.
   ``There doesn't seem to be a surge of phone calls or people
bringing back bags of drugs,'' said James Krahulec, vice president
of government affairs for Rite Aid, the nation's largest drugstore
chain.
   Krahulec said his chain was surveying its nearly 2,300 stores to
gauge public reaction to the scandal enveloping the generic drug
industry, but ``no one has called in with panic information.''
   The FDA has initiated steps in the past month to pull from the
market products manufactured by several generic drug companies.
   In the latest move, the agency said Monday it wants to remove
Bolar Pharmaceuticals Co. Inc.'s generic version of Dyazide, a
popular drug used to treat high blood pressure. The FDA said it
found no evidence of fraud.
   The Copiague, N.Y.-based Bolar, which says it will appeal within
the 30-day limit, said the problem stems from confusion over a
clerical error in identification of samples used in safety tests.
   The FDA also has expanded federal inspections of 11 generic drug
makers to include the plants of 20 additional generic companies and
is reviewing 30 of the most commonly used generic drugs.
   The main question raised about the drugs is whether they work as
effectively as the brand-name drug _ whether they are absorbed into
the body at the same rate as the drug they mimic.
   Wolfe said potency problems were rarely of any significance. In
most cases, he said, doctors prescribe the same dose of medicine for
a 125-pound adult as for a 250-pound adult.
   ``For most drugs, there is a wide range over which the drug will
be effective and safe,'' he said. ``This cuts through a lot of the
extent to which people are overreacting to the problems that have
been brought to light.''
   Generic drugs are copies of brand-name medicines and are usually
much less expensive. A third of all prescriptions written in the
United States are filled with generic drugs, according to the
Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association.

   The stock market got off to a tentative start
today in the wake of Tuesday's retreat led by program trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 0.38 to 2,726.25
at 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues held a slim lead over advancing ones on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 467 down, 459 up and 526 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 22.71 million shares in the first
30 minutes of trading.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.20 to 194.67.
   Wall Street analysts attributed the selling Tuesday to strategies
aimed at profiting from the price differences between stocks and
futures based on stock price indices.
   There was also some disappointment with the Commerce Department
report that the gross national product, the broadest measure of the
economy's performance, grew by 2.7 percent from April through July,
a significant change from the 1.7 percent growth rate originally
reported last month.
   The upward revision lessened the chances that the Federal Reserve
Board will drive down interest rates to pump energy into a flagging
economy, some analysts said.
   Airline stocks continued to attract investors and several
appeared on the Big Board's list of actively traded shares in the
early going.
   Pan Am was unchanged at 4, AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose
1 to 92{ and Delta rose 2 to 84{.
   Texas Utilities headed the actives' list, unchanged at 31}.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.73 to
2,726.63.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a margin of about
11 to 6 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed

<HEAD>Franchisees Offer $200 Million Buyout of Fast Food Chain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of eight franchisees said today it has
offered more than $200 million in cash to buy Arby's fast food chain
from DWG Corp., the holding company controlled by industrialist
Victor Posner.
   The group, calling itself R.B. Partners Ltd., said it made the
offer Aug. 1 in a letter to Posner, who has so far not responded to
the proposal.
   In a letter to fellow franchisees, also released today, the group
said Posner's legal and financial problems could threaten the future
of Atlanta-based Arby's.
   Posner pleaded no contest in 1987 to federal income tax evasion
and was sentenced last year to five years probation on the condition
that he pay all his back taxes, penalties and interest, the cost of
prosecuting his case and create a $3 million homeless fund.
   ``We think it is very unlikely that Arby's could remain
unaffected by all these pressures on Mr. Posner and DWG,'' the
letter to the franchisees said.
   DWG, a Miami-based holding company, controls Arby's Inc., the
marketing, franchising and service company for the 2,100-store
Arby's restaurant chain.
   Officials of Arby's were not immediately available for comment. A
secretary at the chain's Atlanta headquarters said President and
Chief Executive Officer Leonard H. Roberts was in a meeting this
morning.
   The franchisees, who together operate more than 500 Arby's roast
beef restaurants, said their offer represents three times what
Miami-based DWG paid for the chain in 1984 as part of its
acquisition of Royal Crown Cola Companies.
   Arby's reported total revenue of $153.8 million and an operating
profit of $20.7 million in 1988.

   Corn futures prices climbed, wheat prices dipped
and soybeans were mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   The tone was negative in all the pits, however, falling under the
influence of a bearish weather forecast, analysts said.
   The National Weather Service's forecast for the month of
September calls for normal temperatures and rain across the Midwest,
lessening the chance for an early frost that would curb harvest
yields.
   The corn harvest is a month away.
   Traders saw that forecast, and one calling for more rain in the
region by the end of the week, as negative.
   But analysts said corn traders bought on reports that East
Germany is looking to buy half a million tons of U.S. corn.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.83{ a bushel; corn was {
cent to 1 cent higher with September at $2.32{ a bushel; oats were 1
cent to 1{ cents lower, with September at $1.33 a bushel; and
soybeans were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher, with September at
$5.81{ a bushel.
   Frozen pork-belly futures prices climbed, hog prices fell and
cattle were mostly lower in early trading at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   In early trading, live cattle were .02 cent to .23 cent lower,
with the contract for delivery in October at 74.67 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were.17 cent lower to .03 cent higher, with October at
82.05 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .45 cent lower, with
October at 41.30 cents a pound; and pork bellies were .50 cent to
1.28 cents higher, with February at 43.77 cents a pound.
   Pork belly prices soared and kept livestock prices firm in
trading Tuesday.

<HEAD>Personal Income, Consumer Spending, Climb at Healthy Pace</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Adds 2 grafs with total figures for spending and income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Personal incomes rose a healthy 0.7 percent in
July, the best gain in four months, while consumer spending climbed
at its fastest pace in three months, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that consumer spending rose 0.7
percent in July. It was the best gain since a 1.2 percent rise in
April and followed a much weaker 0.2 percent June increase.
   The 0.7 percent rise in personal incomes followed a 0.5 percent
June increase and was the fastest advance since a 1 percent increase
in March.
   The statistics on Americans' income growth and spending habits
provided fresh evidence that the economy is not in danger of
toppling into a recession. The report showed that consumer spending,
which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, is being
bolstered by healthy gains in income.
   Just a month ago, economists were not as certain about the state
of the economy. However, a string of government statistics since
that time have shown that the economy, and in particular the
consumer sector, is not as weak as earlier feared.
   Last month, the government reported that consumer spending, after
removing the effects of inflation, had declined in both May and
June. But in today's report, the inflation-adjusted figures were
revised upward to show modest increases of 0.1 percent in both May
and June.
   On Tuesday, the government significantly revised upward its
estimate of total economic growth, showing that the gross national
product was growing at a healthy annual rate of 2.7 percent in the
April-June quarter instead of the anemic 1.7 percent GNP rate
originally reported. Most of that revision stemmed from the fact
that the rate of consumer spending was doubled from what the
government originally estimated.
   Today's report showed that consumer spending continued strong
going into the first month of the July-September quarter. Many
economists have been busy revising upward their estimates for
overall economic growth this year, pushing their forecasts closer to
the 2.9 percent GNP target set by the Bush administration.
   The July report showed that Americans' income after taxes also
rose 0.7 percent in July, down slightly from a 0.8 percent after-tax
increase in June.
   With incomes growing at the same rate as spending in July,
Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable income,
held steady at 5.7 percent. This is the highest level for savings
since a 6.2 percent rate in March.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
increased $25.4 billion in July, up substantially from a $17.6
billion June increase. This advance occurred despite the fact that
payrolls at manufacturing companies rose by only $1.4 billion, down
from a June increase of $2.9 billion.
   On the spending side, the $25.4 billion rise in personal
consumption spending, which includes everything except interest
payments on debt, compared to a $6.6 billion June advance. Purchases
of durable goods, items expected to last three or more years,
increased $7.6 billion, up sharply from a $2.6 billion June increase.
   Purchases of nondurable goods increased $4.6 billion, compared to
a small $200 million decline in June.
   Purchases of services, which includes housing costs, increased
$13.2 billion, compared to a June increase of $4.2 billion.
   Overall, personal consumption spending came in at an annual rate
of $3.48 trillion in July, following a revised level of $3.46
trillion in June.
   Personal incomes totaled $4.50 trillion at an annual rate in
July, following a revised $4.42 trillion in June.

   With one day to go before directors of UAL Corp.
face a deadline for responding to a $6.19 billion takeover offer,
the unions representing United Airlines' largest worker groups are
scrambling to protect their interests.
   Suitor Marvin Davis, a day after meeting with representatives of
the Association of Flight Attendants, said Tuesday he won't ask for
labor concessions from United's unions, the Chicago Sun-Times
reported today.
   Davis issued a statement saying that Monday's talks with the
flight attendants in San Francisco conclude the first round of talks
between his group and the unions. It was the first admission by
Davis that he has met with United's pilots' union, whose approval is
considered crucial to any takeover, the newspaper reported.
   Meantime, leaders of the pilots' union opened a two-day meeting
Tuesday in New York, where they reportedly were discussing the
possibility of participating in a management buyout of Chicago-based
UAL, United's parent company.
   The Machinists union, which represents United's largest worker
group, met Friday with Davis, the Los Angeles billionaire who is
seeking to buy UAL, to spell out the expectations of United's
mechanics and technical workers should they support his bid.
   And United's flight attendants have urged UAL's board to resume
contract negotiations, saying that in the event of an auction, the
airline will be more valuable with settled contracts. The talks
recently broke down after about two years.
   Davis has given UAL's board until Thursday to respond to his
$275-a-share offer, which he raised from $240 a share on Aug. 16.
   The New York meeting of leaders of the United chapter of the Air
Line Pilots Association was believed to be focused on the
maneuvering for control of the nation's second-largest airline, said
James Hanson, a spokesman for the United pilots in Chicago.
   ``They're dealing with all this takeover stuff and its impact on
the pilots but I couldn't give you any specifics on what is going to
be discussed,'' he said.
   The New York Times reported Tuesday that representatives of the
pilots union and Chicago-based UAL had spent the weekend putting
together a package to present to the United chapter's 27-member
master executive council.
   Pilot leaders and UAL officials reportedly have met several times
in the three weeks since Davis' initial offer was revealed to
discuss an employee-management buyout or a recapitalization that
would put enough stock in an employee stock ownership plan to fend
off a hostile takeover attempt.
   United pilots have been seeking an ownership role in the airline
since 1987. Industry analysts have speculated that management might
invite employees to join in a buyout of UAL in exchange for contract
concessions that could end long-running labor disputes between the
company and its pilots and flight attendants unions.
   Without the support of the flight attendants and Machinists, the
pilots might have to assume a heavier financial burden, in the form
of deeper contract concessions.
   ALPA represents most of United's 6,300 pilots. The Association of
Flight Attendants, which represents another 12,700 United workers,
has urged the UAL board to proceed with caution.
   In a letter to the board last week, the attendants called for a
resumption of contract talks.
   The United chapter of the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers, which represents 25,000 of UAL's 70,000
employees, said last Friday in a letter to the UAL board that they
would ``vigorously oppose'' any buyout or restructuring of the
company.
   But the Times said Tuesday that Brian Freeman, the adviser to the
Machinists, met Friday with Davis and outlined what the Machinists
would expect if they supported his bid.
   Representatives of the flight attendants and the Machinists did
not return calls Tuesday.

   The stock market headed higher across a broad
front today, driven partly by continuing takeover speculation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.73 to 2,739.36 at
noon on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by better than 5 to 3 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 801 up, 474 down and 532 unchanged.

   The Big Board's most heavily traded share was Upjohn which was
bid higher amid talk that a foreign firm might be interested in
acquiring the drug company. Upjohn jumped 2~ to 41\ on volume of
more than 3 million shares.
   Takeover speculation also steered investors toward airline

   Wall Street analysts expected stock prices to attempt a rebound
today after Tuesday's selloff linked to strategies aimed at
profiting from the price differences between stocks and futures
based on stock price indices.
   There was also some disappointment Tuesday with the Commerce
Department report that the gross national product, the broadest
measure of the economy's performance, grew by 2.7 percent from April
through July, a significant change from the 1.7 percent growth rate
originally reported last month.
   The upward revision lessened the chances that the Federal Reserve
Board would decide the economy was in need of the stimulation that
lower interest rates could provide, some analysts said.

<HEAD>Heat Brings Early Harvest, Predictions Of Great Wines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BORDEAUX, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The grape harvest in the Bordeaux wine
region has begun several weeks earlier than usual because of hot,
dry weather, and growers predict an exceptionally good vintage.
   Jean-Bernard Delmas, director of Chateau Haut-Brion, said picking
of grapes destined for white wines began Tuesday in his vineyards,
with the red wine harvest likely to start later in the week.
   ``I can assure you, at least if it doesn't rain, that the 1989
vintage will be the greatest in the century,'' Delmas said.
   He said it was the first time since 1893 that the harvest has
opened before Sept. 1 at Chateau Haut-Brion.
   Because conditions can differ markedly even between nearby
vineyards, the harvest starts at varying times.
   The hot and dry conditions that lead to early harvest give the
grapes an unusually high sugar level. They are likely to produce a
comparatively small amount of wine but of very high quality,
according to the Interprofessional Council of the Wines of Bordeaux.

<HEAD>Hawaiian Airlines Parent Signs Definitive Agreement for Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   HAL Inc., parent company of Hawaiian Airlines,
has signed a definitive agreement for its sale to an investment
group that includes former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth.
   The investment group, however, said Tuesday that HAL Chairman
John Magoon Jr. must tender nearly all of his controlling interest
for a proposed takeover to go through.
   The group, headed by former airline executive J. Thomas Talbot of
California, plans to purchase 51 percent of HAL's outstanding stock
_ about 1.2 million shares in all. It offered $22 a share for each
share of common stock, making the deal worth about $21.9 million.
   Talbot was a key member of a Ueberroth-led group that attempted
to acquire strikebound Eastern Airlines earlier this year.
   In a news release about the HAL deal, the group said 1.1 million
shares must come from Magoon and other HAL officers and directors.
Magoon owns a controlling interest in the company with more than 1
million shares.
   The agreement, already approved by HAL's directors, is subject to
approval by government agencies and shareholders, and the airline's
unions.
   HAL has scheduled a stockholders meeting for Oct. 19 to obtain
the required shareholder approval. Shareholders of record as of
Sept. 5 will be eligible to vote.
   HAL lost $13 million in the first half of this year and has lost
a total of $30.6 million over the past 2{ years.
   Hawaiian Airlines, Hawaii's largest inter-island airline, also
serves Los Angeles; San Francisco; Seattle; Anchorage, Alaska; Las
Vegas; Australia; New Zealand and other South Pacific points.
   The 60-year-old airline's fleet of 31 planes carried 5.5 million
passengers in 1988.

   Oilman and takeover strategist T. Boone Pickens
said today he will not run for Texas governor because he could not
give all his attention to the state's problems.
   ``I can't make that commitment at this stage in my life,''
Pickens said. ``I've decided without regrets that I have other
challenges and other responsibilities.''
   Pickens made the disclosure to about 500 people at a Rotary
luncheon. He said he must devote full attention to his business.
   Pickens, 61, chairman of Mesa Limited Partnership of Amarillo,
signed a contract on a $2 million home in the Dallas area earlier
this month, the Dallas Times Herald reported Tuesday. His firm's
financial division also is moving from Amarillo to downtown Dallas.
   Although Pickens said the moves were for business and not
political reasons, he also said he faced some business problems that
could block his path in a race for governor.
   His partnership announced a $13.4 million loss for the second
quarter of 1989 and he said today the company will likely post a
loss in the third quarter.
   ``Mesa will weather the tough times, but I have a responsibility
to my shareholders to see this through,'' Pickens said.
   Pickens initially said he would announce a decision by Aug. 15,
then later delayed that announcement until the end of the month.
   Republicans who have announced for governor so far are Midland
oilman-businessman Jack Rains, who was secretary of state until
resigning this summer, Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance, and oilman
Clayton Williams of Midland.
   The only announced Democratic candidate is state Treasurer Ann
Richards.
   Pickens, a feared corporate raider who has chased some of the
biggest U.S. companies, made headlines earlier this summer by trying
to get three seats on the board of directors of a Japanese headlight
manufacturer.
   Shareholders of Koito Manufacturing Co. voted overwhelmingly
against naming Pickens to the board, even though he was the
company's largest shareholder with 20.2 percent of the stock.

<HEAD>Lorenzo Trying to Persuade Trump to Buy Continental</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo has met
with Donald J. Trump in an effort to persuade the New York developer
to buy Continental Airlines, a Trump associate said Wednesday.
   ``Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Trump have spoken,'' said Bruce Nobles,
president of Trump Shuttle, which the developer purchased from
Lorenzo last June for $365 million.
   But Trump has concerns about a potential purchase of Continental,
a subsidiary of Texas Air, Nobles said, noting that Trump is
concerned about Continental's $2.5 billion debt, its small cash
reserves and the need to refurbish many of its planes.
   While Trump remains interested and believes his name would help
the Houston-based carrier win passengers, he has not been convinced
that the risks are acceptable, Nobles said in a telephone interview.
   ``His (Trump's) concerns are well put,'' said Nobles, a former
Texas Air and Pan Am Corp. official.
   Trump was unavailable for comment Wednesday, a spokesman said.
Art Kent, a Texas Air spokesman in Houston, said Lorenzo had no
comment on the matter.
   In talks with Trump, said to have been held over the past month,
Lorenzo said his negative image has hurt Continental, according to
sources quoted in Wednesday's editions of the New York Times.
   Lorenzo announced last Thursday that Houston-based Texas Air, the
nation's largest airline company, may consider selling a minority or
controlling interest in Continental.
   Strikebound Eastern Airlines, Texas Air's other airline
subsidiary, apparently would not be involved in any Continental
transaction.
   Last week, Lorenzo told The Associated Press that one reason he
was considering selling a stake in Continental was that the bitter
struggle with Eastern's unions had hurt traffic at Continental.
   Texas Air is also involved in talks about selling a major stake
in Continental to Scandinavian Airlines System and an unidentified
partner, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Texas Air declined
to comment on the report.
   SAS already has a 9.9 percent stake in Texas Air as part of a
joint marketing agreement.
   Sources were quoted by the Times as saying that Lorenzo was
impressed with the way traffic on the former Eastern Air Shuttle in
the Northeast picked up since Trump bought it.
   Trump's share of the lucrative Northeast shuttle market, split
with Pan Am, has ``approximately doubled since we took over,''
Nobles said. Although he declined to give precise figures, he said
Trump Shuttle's market share has jumped from around 25 percent when
it started operations in early June to about 50 percent currently.
   ``I think being separated from Eastern is a positive; having the
Trump name is a positive; having better service is a positive,''
Nobles said.
   But rival Pan Am disputed Nobles' estimate of current market
share. Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said the Pan Am Shuttle's
share, at around 75 percent when Trump started up, is now holding at
roughly 60 percent.
   ``We're quite pleased with the clientele that we think we've been
able to keep since they started,'' she said.
   The Times quoted its sources as saying that SAS favored a deal
with Continental involving Trump.
   SAS board member Kaj Ikast said Tuesday that the carrier was not
near a decision on taking a stake in Continental. Ikast told the
Times there have been talks with Texas Air about buying such a stake.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc., flush with cash, said
Wednesday it was raising its dividend 22.2 percent and splitting its
shares 4 for 1.
   The world's largest consumer products company makes more profit
than it can reasonably reinvest in its businesses, so it gives the
rest to shareholders in higher dividends.
   Since its stock price keeps rising, it has to lower the price
periodically through share splits to make a standard lot of 100
shares more affordable to small investors.
   New York-based Philip Morris makes cigarettes and owns Kraft,
General Foods, Oscar Meyer and Miller Brewing Co. It earned $1.34
billion on revenue of $22.4 billion in the first half of the year.
   The 4-for-1 stock split means shareholders will own four shares
for each one they have now. The extra shares will be distributed
Oct. 10 to shareholders of record on Sept. 15.
   The dividend increase will raise annual dividends to $5.50 per
share on a pre-split basis, or $1.37{ per new share.
   Quarterly dividends have been increased 25 times in the last 22
years. Including the latest split, one share in 1966 will have
turned into 192 shares by October.

<HEAD>HCA Accepting $100 Million Less Than Expected for Psychiatric Unit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospital Corporation of America said
Wednesday that it will take $100 million less than the expected
$1.225 billion for its psychiatric company, the largest HCA unit for
sale to help finance the company's management-led takeover.
   HCA executives said in March, when shareholders voted to sell the
company for $3.6 billion, that subsidiaries would be sold to repay a
$1.3 billion bridge loan due in two years.
   ``We are ahead of schedule of our repayment of the bridge loan,''
HCA spokesman David McFadden said.
   The company said in a news release that it has received senior
loan financing commitments and other financing details involved in
selling HCA Psychiatric Company. Psychiatric company executives and
an employee stock ownership plan support the sale.
   While HCA will accept the lower purchase price, it will retain
ownership of $150 million in the psychiatric company's common stock
and preferred stock along with warrants to buy additional shares of
common stock.
   Officials said $650 million in financing will be provided by GE
Capital and The Bank of Nova Scotia. GE Capital also will buy $60
million of the psychiatric company's senior discount notes.
   Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. will arrange the placement of debt and
preferred stock of HPC for $530 million, accounting for the rest of
the financing.
   Financing still has to be approved by HCA's board with closing
expected to be completed by the end of the year.
   The psychiatric company owns 52 facilities with about 5,500 beds.
   HCA owns 78 medical-surgical hospitals with more than 18,000 beds
in the United States.
   HCA Chairman Thomas Frist Jr. said in March that the company
would likely sell its psychiatric division, its management company
and its international division to held finance the leveraged buyout.
   In a leveraged buyout, the assets of the company are used as
collateral to borrow money needed to purchase the company. Such a
transaction usually increases the company's debt substantially.
   Sale of HCA's Allied Clinical Laboratories already was being
considered when the merger was approved March 15.
   At the time, Frist said he wanted to streamline HCA to get back
to the basic business of owning and managing hospitals.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury in Anchorage is
investigating possible criminal charges against Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co. arising from the nation's worst oil spill.
   The news was disclosed in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission by Atlantic Richfield Co. which said its
subsidiary, ARCO Pipeline, has been subpoenaed for records of ARCO's
``review and evaluation of Alyeska's oil spill equipment, personnel,
capabilities and contingency plans.''
   ARCO Pipeline owns about 21 percent of Alyeska, the company that
operates the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and the tanker terminal in
Valdez on behalf of eight major North Slope oil producers.
   Alyeska was responsible for the first response the March 24
grounding of the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound. The company
has been criticized by the state for its inadequate handling of the
11-million-gallon spill.
   ARCO also reported that Alyeska has received two subpoenas.
   Rumors of a grand jury investigation have been circulating since
the tanker damaged its hull on Bligh Reef but the Aug. 11 SEC filing
by ARCO was the first confirmation that a probe actually is under
way.
   The FBI has acknowledged only that it is looking into the
possibility that federal laws may have been violated. The state
briefly investigated both Exxon and Alyeska, but dropped the matter
several months ago, saying federal laws carried stiffer penalties.
   Chuck Lontor, head of the FBI in Alaska, refused again Tuesday to
talk about the investigation.
   ``I can appreciate your frustration,'' said Lontor. ``It is just
policy that we do not talk about a grand jury.
   ``We will investigate until we believe all leads have been
exhausted,'' Lontor said when asked how long the probe might
continue. ``I can't say that will be a week from now or a month from
now.''

   The U.S. dollar was mixed Wednesday against major
currencies in choppy European trading. Gold prices fell in London

   Dealers said the market was like a ``yo-yo'' with technical

   They said dealers were awaiting a report on U.S. unemployment in

   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.07 yen to a closing 143.08 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 143.33 yen.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5815 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5945 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.9465 West German marks, up from 1.9375; 1.6770 Swiss francs, up

grown in 46 countries meets the standards of the New York Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange.
   It's a job that has become more important because of the
suspension of coffee export limits this summer, which resulted in a
flood of beans pouring into the United States, the world's biggest
coffee market.
   Rejection could mean huge losses for importers and brokers,
particularly now that producers can't rely on the agreement to sell
their coffee beans and therefore must compete on quality.
   Though the rejected coffee isn't discarded, it may sit longer in
a warehouse, could be sold at a discount or end up as a roasted
blend or generic-brand instant, the coffee equivalent of an old
horse sent to the glue factory.
   On this particular day, about $2 million worth of coffee _ or
nearly 2.5 million pounds _ is at stake. But there were periods in
the last two years when all was quiet in what's known in coffee
parlance as ``the grading room.''
   ``There was absolutely nothing going on for 4 to 5 months,
nothing, zero,'' says Glenn Garnes, grading room assistant at the
exchange where coffee, sugar and cocoa contracts are traded.
   Coffee sold quickly in those days because of export quotas set by
the International Coffee Organization, the cartel of producers that
artificially determined prices through limiting the supply.
   Tight supplies and high demand meant that a lot of coffee
bypassed the exchange and went directly to brokers or roasters.
   With more beans to judge these days the tasters must slurp more
mouthfuls of coffee. Since they're paid by the number of bags
tested, their take has increased to about $630 for nearly two hours'
work, which amounts to more than $12 a slurp. During normal periods
they earn about $200.
   On July 4 the ICO temporarily suspended export ceilings that had
kept wholesale prices at between $1.20 and $1.40 a pound. U.S.
roasters had criticized the quotas for limiting access to quality
coffee.
   With coffee pouring into the United States, prices have tumbled
nearly 40 percent and made it a buyers market.
   Further depressing prices is the normal slow summer roasting
period, a long-term decline in U.S. coffee consumption and efforts
by producers to empty warehouses before the new harvest starting in
September.
   ``If the market is already at these levels in anticipation of new
crops what will happen when the new crop actually comes?,'' says
Bert Ruiz, industry analyst with the New York brokerage firm Balfour
Maclaine Corp.
   Retail prices also have fallen. Two of the biggest roasters,
General Foods Corp. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which have about 65
percent of the U.S. coffee market, announced big price cuts Aug. 7.
   General Foods, which markets Maxwell House and Sanka coffees,
said it dropped the average price it charges retailers 23 cents a
pound for ground roasted coffee. Procter &amp; Gamble, marketer of
Folgers, lowered its price by 20 cents to about $2.50 a pound.
   There's not much talking in the grading room as the testers judge
the coffee first by color and grade, or purity. Working in teams of
three they sort through pans of small green coffee beans for
imperfections _ brown, black, rotten or faded beans.
   Dirt and other impurities count against the batch. Every five bad
beans, or one black bean, equals one imperfection. Fifteen
imperfections disqualifies the entire lot.
   Color also is important because as coffee ages it loses moisture
and fades, says taster Steve Colten, quality control manager for J.
Aron &amp; Co. coffee importers. Colten and the 26 other graders,
including two women recently added to the erstwhile male group,
leave jobs or other activities to grade coffee.
   Each pan, representing one 37,500-pound lot, is numbered so the
testers know only the country of origin.
   ``We work blind so nothing biases our opinion,'' says Bill
Griffin, former senior buyer for Nestle Foods Corp.
   Knowing the country is important because shades of color differ
as do acidity and flavor, tasters say. Coffees with earthy, fermenty
characteristics passable for one country's coffees wouldn't be for
another.
   A tantalizing aroma fills the room as the beans are thrown into
old-fashioned roasters for browning over an open flame. The beans
are then ground and steeped in boiling water in preparation for
tasting, the ultimate proving ground.
   With a loud slurp Ray Schlegelmilch sucks in a spoonful of brew,
twirls it around his tongue and spits into a silver spittoon near
his feet. Quickly adjusting the swivel-top table he brings the next
cup into position, breaks through the film of grounds atop the
liquid, scoops another mouthful and repeats the ritual. In a matter
of seconds he has tasted 21 cups.
   Body, the right twinge of acidity and a good ``bouquet'' or aroma
are important. But tasters look for ``negative rather than positive
characteristics,'' says Justin Colten, a former executive with J.
Aron, who believes coffee tasting is ``a very unique art.''
   Anything ``off odor,'' _ a dirty, groundy or musty smell _ or
that tastes too acidic, leathery, fermented, medicinal or earthy is
rejected.
   This day, a Mexican coffee that has already passed color and
grade tests is rejected on taste. Garnes calls the importer, who
requests a second opinion. Three more tasters are asked to judge the
brew. It passes on second tasting.
   The testers, all current or retired coffee-industry executives,
are purists about coffee outside the grading room, too. Some are so
choosy they won't buy coffee already roasted, much less ground.
Several buy raw beans and roast them at home.
   ``Anyone in the coffee business is very picky about their
coffee,'' says Steve Colten.
   As for the latest fad _ flavored coffee, which is marinated in
liquid flavorings ranging from cinnamon to coconut _ the tasters
turn up their noses.
   ``It's adulterated,'' says one.
   ``No one grows cinnamon nut flavored coffee,'' says another. ``If
you get a good cup of coffee you don't need flavorings. You don't
even need cream or sugar.''

   IBM Japan Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. said Wednesday they
plan to establish a joint venture company to make color liquid
crystal displays _ key components in popular computer terminal
screens.
   Plant construction for the new company, called Display
Technologies Inc., will begin in March 1990 in Himeji, about 375
miles west of Tokyo, with completion scheduled in April 1991, the
companies said.
   The equally owned Display Technologies, with an initial capital
of 1 billion yen, or about $7 million, will have an annual
production capability of 1 million 10-inch or larger LCDs by 1994,
said Toshiba managing director Tsuyoshi Kawanishi at a joint news
conference.
   LCDs are among the most important technologies for future
products for both Toshiba and IBM, the companies said.
   IBM Japan managing director, Nobuo Mii, said color LCDs made be
Display Technologies would be sold to the parent companies. He said
Toshiba, Japan's second-largest electric machinery maker, and IBM
would incorporate these devices in their products, including
personal computers and work stations, for marketing worldwide.

   The stock market posted modest losses this
afternoon, recovering from a selloff that wiped out many of today's
earlier gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 1.14 at 2,725.49
at 3 p.m. on Wall Street. The average, which sported a gain of 12.73
points at noon, had been down 9.30 at 2 p.m.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 730 down, 670 up and 525 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 146.01 million shares with one
hour left to go.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks was off
0.12 to 194.35 at 3 p.m. EDT.
   Futures-related program selling hit the market this afternoon and
temporarly knocked down share prices but they managed to bob back
up. Earlier, the market was staging a rebound after Tuesday's
selloff linked to the computer-driven strategies aimed at profiting
from price differences between stocks and futures based on stock
price indices.
   A government report that furnished further evidence of economic
health failed to have much impact on Wall Street. The Commerce
Department said U.S. personal income rose 0.7 percent in July, the
best gain in four months, while consumer spending climbed at its
fastest pace in three months.
   With the economy apparently doing better than many analysts had
thought, it is much less likely that the Federal Reserve Board will
nudge interest rates lower to stimulate growth.
   An upward revision in the gross national product, the broadest
measure of the economy's performance, reported Tuesday had
diminished hopes that the central bank would cut interest rates.
   The Commerce Department said the GNP grew by 2.7 percent from
April through July, a significant change from the 1.7 percent growth
rate originally reported last month.
   The Big Board's most heavily traded share was Upjohn which was
bid higher amid talk that a foreign firm might be interested in
acquiring the drug company. Upjohn jumped 2\ to 40| on volume of
more than 4 million shares.
   Takeover speculation continued to steer investors toward airline
stocks. AMR, parent of American Airlines, spurted another 2\ to 93},

   Wheat futures prices dipped while corn and
soybeans were mixed in trading Wednesday at the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   With little news to affect the market, traders sold on the
National Weather Service's 30-day forecast that predicts normal
temperatures and rain for the month of September.
   The forecast dims any talk of an early frost that would curb
harvest yields. The corn harvest is a month away.
   In addition, more rain is expected to move into the Midwest by
the end of the week, adding further downward pressure to prices,
analysts said.
   Corn futures rose early in the session on reports that East
Germany is looking to buy half a million tons of U.S. corn, but
quickly fell under the negative weather influences.
   At the close of trading, wheat was } cent to 2 cents lower, with

   Exxon Corp. said Wednesday it has named marine
scientist John H. Steele as a director, in response to shareholder
demands for the addition of an environmental expert following the
nation's worst oil spill.
   Steele, 62, is president and a senior scientist at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution. He also will serve on the board's newly
formed public issues committee, which will monitor the company's
environmental policies.
   ``This is a good day for the environment and Exxon
shareholders,'' said Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, trustee for New
York's employee, firefighter and police pension funds.
   New York was one of several pension funds with large holdings of
Exxon stock that has publicized its dissatisfaction with the oil
giant's handling of the March 24 spill and cleanup effort.
   The funds, which included New York State and the California
Public Employee Retirement System, the largest individual U.S.
public pension fund, had called for Exxon to appoint a director with
expertise and interest in the environment.
   Goldin said the appointment ``demonstrates environmental and
social responsibility'' in the aftermath of the disaster in which
the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a charted reef and spewed millions of
gallons of oil into Prince William Sound.
   In a telephone interview from his office in Woods Hole, Mass.,
about 70 miles south of Boston on the southeast end of Cape Cod,
Steele spoke of the spill.
   ``I think it's a terrible tragedy and a major disaster not just
for the animals but for the people in Alaska,'' Steele said.
   He declined to comment on Exxon's handling of the cleanup but
said he would visit Alaska in about two weeks for a separate
scientific meeting on arctic research and would view the remnants of
the spill at that time.
   ``It will give me an opportunity to discuss these research and
scientific questions with colleagues in Alaska,'' he said.
   Steele will serve on the board until Exxon's annual shareholder's
meeting next April, when his name will be submitted for shareholder
approval along with the other directors, said Exxon spokesman Bill
Smith.
   At the company's annual shareholders last May, shareholders
demanded changes in what they called Exxon's ``inadequate state of
preparedness'' for dealing with future problems.
   Although the funds ultimately voted for management this year,
they warned of a major shareholder revolt next year if the Exxon
appointment was unsatisfactory to dissident shareholders.
   At the May meeting, Exxon management agreed to create the
six-member public issues committee, which includes four non-Exxon
employees. Exxon said the committee would review the corporation's
``policies, programs and practices on public issues of significance
including their effects on the environment and worker safety and
health.''
   Steele's appointment increases the size of the Exxon board to 15,
including ten non-employee directors.
   Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Steele's career includes 26 years at
the Marine Laboratory at Aberdeen, Scotland. He joined Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution in 1977.
   Steele's principal research includes the marine environment. He
is the U.S. delegate to the International Council for Exploration of
the Sea.

   If you're looking for an unfinished luxury home
with no utilities but such extras as graffiti declaring ``Led
Zeppelin Rules,'' Frank Norris has just the place for you.
   Norris and an army of bureaucrats like him are ready to deal.
They work for the Resolution Trust Corp., an agency created Aug. 9
when President Bush signed legislation bailing out the savings and
loan industry.
   Norris, 55, manages Commonwealth Savings Association, a Houston
thrift institution with $1.6 billion in assets and $600 million in
red ink.
   Along with others working for the RTC, he's trying to sell
thousands of repossessed properties the government is inheriting
from as many as 600 failed thrift institutions.
   The properties range from run-of-the-mill to the exotic; from
apartment buildings, shopping centers and office towers to a
windmill farm, a buffalo sperm bank and the entire town of Lehigh
Acres, Fla., population 25,000.
   No one knows for certain how much it's all worth. The
government's own estimate _ $300 billion to $500 billion _ leaves a
wide margin for error.
   But even at the low end of the range, the RTC, when running at
full capacity, will in effect be the largest financial institution
in the country, twice as large as Citicorp, the nation's biggest
bank.
   Already, lawyers, accountants and real estate specialists are
swarming, hoping to secure contracts as consultants helping
regulators manage and sell the property. Speculators are circling,
hoping to buy cheap.
   A handful of newsletters devoted solely to covering the agency
have sprung up. One, the Resolution Trust Reporter, advertised for
subscribers at $398 a year by asking, ``Who's Going to Cash in When
the Resolution Trust Corp. Opens Its Doors? HOW ABOUT YOU?''
   Consumer watchdogs warn the task is so mammoth and so difficult
that scandal is inevitable, scandal dwarfing the troubles now
plaguing the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Whether or not these dire predictions prove true largely depends
on Norris and other federal agents managing 260 of the most deeply
insolvent S&amp;Ls already under government control in 33 states.
   They are the antithesis of the high-fliers who drove the S&amp;Ls
into the red by making fraudulent loans and spending depositors'
funds on lavish parties and corporate jets.
   On the job, they may sit in paneled executive suites and oversee
hundreds of employees. But on their own time, they drive rented
cars, live out of suitcases and eat in cafeterias for lunch.
   How well they perform likely will be the critical factor in
deciding whether the government successfully completes the S&amp;L
bailout without turning to the taxpayers for more money.
   If the RTC sells the property it is inheriting too fast or too
cheaply, it could ruin real estate values across the oil-producing
regions of the Southwest, further narrowing the taxpayers' chances
of recovering part of their contribution to the bailout, estimated
at $1,000 each.
   If it keeps the property too long, maintenance and other costs
could quickly pile up, offsetting any gain realized by holding out
for a higher price.
   The problem is that much of it is virtually unsellable at any
price. Nevertheless, Norris has banished the word ``problem'' from
his vocabulary, substituting ``opportunity.''
   ``We have plenty of opportunities. Absolutely!'' he says with the
kind of overly cheerful tone used only by a dentist or a man who
dismantles banks for a living.
   Commonwealth's contribution to the real estate mess is about $670
million in repossessed property. While Norris has none of the
out-of-the-ordinary repossessions that grab headlines, what he does
have amply illustrates the ``opportunities'' ahead for the RTC.
Here's a sampling:
   _Two single-family homes in a prosperous northwestern Houston
neighborhood. Tract mansions, they were built on speculation and
repossessed, still unfinished, after the developer couldn't make the
payments on a $794,000 loan.
   In one, swarms of mosquitoes stream through broken windows and
buzz over the glass-strewn floors of what would have been an elegant
living room with a stone fireplace and cathedral ceiling. In the
other, an empty beer can, candle drippings and graffiti _ ``Led
Zeppelin Rules'' _ show that local youths have made a hangout of
what would have been a luxury kitchen encircled by maple-stained
cabinets. At most, the homes are now worth $100,000 each.
   _A shopping strip not far from Houston's posh Galleria mall. Cars
cluster in one end of the parking lot around an eight-theater
cinema. At the other end, diners stroll from a cafeteria. Between
the two stand empty stores, a long expanse of concrete and blank
glass. The strip is probably worth less than half of Commonwealth's
$15 million loan.
   _A vacant lot, just off Houston's busy Southwest Freeway. A
developer borrowed $14 million, hoping to build an office tower on
the spot, but the deal fell through.
   All three properties are far from ready for sale. The would-be
luxury homes, for instance, have deteriorated so sharply that it
could cost more to make them habitable and attractive than it would
to buy similar homes in good shape.
   The shopping center encroaches on an adjoining property, and the
government will have to pay lawyers to clear up the title problem
before sale.
   Parcels have been carved from the vacant lot for a gas station
and a drive-in bank, leaving an irregularly shaped piece of land
scarcely suitable for an office building, even if there were demand
for more office space in Houston, which there is not.
   Multiply Commonwealth's problems 30-fold to get an idea of the
magnitude of the S&amp;L mess in Houston. Multiply Commonwealth 700-fold
to get an appreciation of the problem nationally.

   A skeleton of what will be the world's
tallest wooden roller coaster already rises above the trees at Six
Flags Over Texas, and planners are concocting other gut-wrenching
thrills.
   Walt Disney Co. has splurged on a fantasyland of Hollywood
diversions and acquired rights to many of the Muppets, who will
cavort with Mickey and Goofy at Disney theme parks.
   Bidders seeking Sea World may pay more than $1 billion for Shamu,
the killer whale, and other finned celebrities.
   All this maneuvering reflects one common handicap in the $4
billion amusement-park business: Mother Nature still calls most of
the shots in a relatively short season that winds down after Labor
Day. So, the search for new diversions never ends.
   This summer, rain and heat kept many fun parks waiting for the
crowds, although others reported a late surge to surpass year-ago
levels.
   Especially hard hit were the 200 or so water parks, a fairly new
entrant into the amusement game.
   ``Our June was just horrendous,'' said John Seeker, spokesman for
Wet 'N Wild, a water park across the freeway from Six Flags in
Arlington. ``It's almost like summer never came.''
   Others had a better time of it.
   ``We had one weekend in August, which is traditionally one of our
biggest months, where we almost didn't even open. But despite all
that we're well ahead of last year,'' said Ed Carroll, general
manager at Riverside Park in Agawam, Mass., which added six new
water rides this year.
   Crystal Beach was not so lucky. The 101-year-old park in Fort
Erie, Ontario, Canada, just across the bridge from Buffalo, N.Y.,
said it will close down its rides after this season, reflecting
increased competition and dwindling crowds.
   ``This year we just took a nose dive,'' said President Joseph
Biondolillo. ``A lot of it was due to the rainy spring. Then we
started to lose numbers during the good weather.''
   Last year, the nation's 600 amusement parks reported more than
249 million visitors and operators surveyed in July said they
expected about a 2 percent increase this year, taking the early
season weather problems into account.
   But prices may also be holding back attendance.
   Admission to 27-year-old Six Flags Over Texas is $19.95, on the
high end of prices among regional parks.
   ``It's a little steep, especially when all four of us come,''
said Jackie Corley, who was visiting the park on a recent,
100-degree day.
   ``We'd think twice'' about coming back if the price were
increased, she said.
   Even next year's scheduled debut of the $5 million Texas Giant, a
4,920-foot long wooden roller coaster, might not be enough to
overcome the price, she said.
   Daughter Elisa, however, had a different view. She likes the park
``because I can have fun.''
   Roller coasters are a big draw at the larger parks, and are
frequently the main attractions.
   Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, for example, has a much-ballyhooed
new coaster this year _ the $3 million Timberwolf, and attendance is
up 10 percent, park officials said.
   The coaster recently was rated No. 2 in the nation in a survey by
Inside Track, a publication for roller coaster enthusiasts.
   ``We just had to come to see it,'' said Sara Johnson of Topeka,
Kan., at Worlds of Fun on a recent weekend with family members.
   She and family said the park was expensive, but they regarded it
as a special, once-a-summer outing and were willing to pay.
   In Houston, at Six Flags-owned Astroworld, The Viper coaster also
helped the park overcome early season doldrums brought on by
Tropical Storm Allison and Hurricane Chantal.
   There will be a new ride at Astroworld next year as well, but
spokeswoman Debra Ford wouldn't reveal the nature of the attraction,
except to say, ``it's going to be a great thrill ride.''
   The newest generation of thrills involves motion simulation _
rides that give passengers the feel of hurtling through space, or
under water, or flying an airplane. They can cost from $120,000 to
$2 million each, depending on the sophistication.
   The smaller scale of the motion simulators _ they don't require
towering support structures _ reflect a trend toward downsizing and
regionalization.
   ``We're close to saturation. There's no major metropolitan area
in the United States that doesn't have a park within easy driving
distance,'' said Peter Irish, an official with the International
Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, an industry group in
Alexandria, Va.
   As a result, IAAPA trade shows include seminars on miniature
golf, go-cart tracks, batting cages and arcades, Irish said.
   Parks also are turning to concerts and other entertainment to
draw people during slack times. An IAAPA survey this summer showed
more than 30 percent of the projects planned for the largest parks
were for entertainment.
   The parks are hoping to attract more customers like Paul and
Paula Jarvis of Bowie, Md., who visited Williamsburg, Va.'s Busch
Gardens along with their grandchildren.
   ``We like the shows,'' Mrs. Jarvis said. ``We really don't go for
the rides too much.''
   Regional does not mean less lucrative. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc. is selling off its parks _ four Sea Worlds, plus other smaller
parks near its Orlando headquarters _ and it is estimated the deal
could bring the publisher $1.5 billion, 23 times what HBJ paid for
the three Sea Worlds it bought in 1976.
   Bigger is still better as far as players like Disney are
concerned, however.
   With this year's addition of the new Disney-MGM Studios theme
park in Florida and the announced purchase of rights to the Muppet
characters this past week, Disney's pursuit of new attractions has
reached Barnum-esque proportions.
   The Disney-MGM theme park is a $400 million playground with
diversions that range from do-it-yourself music videos to
recreations of 1940s Hollywood Boulevard.
   ``The public response to the new Disney-MGM Studios theme park
has been overwhelming, beyond our wildest dreams. It has led to our
decision to expand the park, doubling it in size in the next two
years,'' spokesman John Dreyer said.
   The company refuses to disclose attendance figures, but one
analyst estimates as many as 150,000 a day pass through the Disney
gates in Florida, paying $100 for a four-day ticket.
   Its size and variety make a Disney a ``destination park'' in the
lingo of the amusement business. It also profits from nearby
attractions that have sprung up in its shadow and feed off its
success. The Orlando area is home to Sea World, Boardwalk and
Baseball, Cypress Gardens and Busch Gardens nearby in Tampa. In
addition, MCA Inc. is investing $600 million in a Universal Studio
park near Orlando to compete with Disney.

   The dollar rose sharply Wednesday against key
foreign currencies after a mixed performance overseas.
   Gold prices slipped. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery closed at $361.80 a troy ounce, down
$1.80 from late Tuesday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
late bid for gold of $360.35 an ounce, down $1.65.
   Currency dealers said market sentiment toward the dollar was
bullish following the release of U.S. government reports showing
continued economic strength, which lessens the possibility of lower
interest rates.
   ``The economic numbers ... continued to keep the dollar well
supported in spite of technical selling,'' said Ronald H. Holzer,
chief currency dealer for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   The government reported Wednesday that personal incomes rose a
brisk 0.7 percent in July while consumer spending climbed at the
fastest rate since April.
   On Tuesday, the government revised upward its estimate of total
economic growth, putting the increase in the gross national product
during the second quarter at a healthy 2.7 percent annual rate
instead of the anemic 1.7 percent rate reported a month ago.
   Dealers say they're now awaiting a report on August unemployment
due out Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.07 Japanese yen to a closing 143.08 yen. It was
quoted higher in London at 143.33 yen, and in New York at 144.25
yen, up from 143.01 late Tuesday.
   The dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $1.5815 to buy
one pound in London, cheaper than $1.5945 late Tuesday. Sterling
fetched $1.5779 in New York, down from $1.5870.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.9533 West German marks, up from 1.9362; 1.6832 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6704; 6.5775 French francs, up from 6.5285; 1.1769
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1754; and 1,400.50 Italian lire, up from
1,391.25.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.9465 West German marks, up from 1.9375; 1.6770 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6685; 6.5515 French francs, up from 6.5325; 2.1830
Dutch guilders, down from 2.1940; 1.1760 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1724; and 1,389.50 Italian lire, down from 1,396.00.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $360.75 an ounce from
Tuesday's $364.00. But it closed higher in Zurich, Switzerland, at
$361.80 an ounce from $360.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.55 to close at a bid $362.37
an ounce.
   Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery fell to $5.085 a troy ounce from $5.091 late Tuesday.
Silver fell in London to $5.11 an ounce from $5.15.

<HEAD>Arby's Owner Spurns Franchisees' $200 Million Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of franchisees operating more than 500
Arby's fast-food restaurants said Wednesday it had offered over $200
million for the chain, but the owner says it's not interested in
selling.
   Arby's Inc. is owned by a company controlled by DWG Corp., a
Miami-based holding company controlled by industrialist Victor
Posner.
   The group of eight franchisees said it wanted to buy the
Atlanta-based chain because DWG's continued ownership could threaten
the stability of Arby's, partly because of Posner's legal and
financial problems.
   ``We believe strongly that Arby's Inc. should be owned by its
franchisees,'' the group, incorporated as R.B. Partners Ltd., said
in a letter Tuesday to fellow franchisees.
   ``We are not trying to profit from taking the lead here,'' said
the letter, released Wednesday. ``We are trying to protect the
Arby's system.''
   Posner pleaded no contest in 1987 to federal income tax evasion
and was sentenced last year to five years probation on the condition
that he pay all his back taxes, penalties and interest, the cost of
prosecuting his case and create a $3 million fund to benefit the
homeless.
   ``We think it is very unlikely that Arby's could remain
unaffected by all these pressures on Mr. Posner and DWG,'' read the
franchisees' letter.
   Arby's is a wholly owned subsidiary of Miami Beach-based
Chesapeake Financial Corp., of which DWG is a 60 percent owner.
   Chesapeake, in a statement released Wednesday, termed the R.B.
Partners proposal ``an unsolicited purported offer.'' Chesapeake
also said, ``as it had previously informed such franchisees, it
presently had no interest in pursuing such a sale.''
   Posner, who is chairman of Arby's Inc., is ``committed to the
continued growth and expansion of Arby's _ a process which, under
his management, had resulted in outstanding performance and growth
since its acquisition in June 1984,'' Chesapeake stated.
   Officials at Arby's headquarters in Atlanta could not be reached
for comment Wednesday. A secretary said President and Chief
Executive Officer Leonard H. Roberts was in a meeting.
   The franchisees said their offer represents three times what DWG
paid for the chain in 1984 as part of its acquisition of Royal Crown
Cola Companies. Arby's, with about 2,100 restaurants, reported total
revenue of $153.8 million and an operating profit of $20.7 million
in 1988.
   A spokesman for the franchisees, who asked that his name not be
used, said Wednesday the group wass confident it could raise the
money for the deal and had been assured by a number of institutions
that it could get financing.
   Howard Hansen, a restaurant industry analyst with Kidder Peabody
in New York, said there have been some cases of successful
franchisee buyouts. But he said the main obstacle for the group
would be raising the money.
   ``I don't believe there would be any legal hurdles. You have to
come up with the money,'' Hansen said.

<HEAD>Split Among Kohlberg Kravis Partners Widens With Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., its image one of
confidence and strength, stormed to the top of the takeover business
by accomplishing billion-dollar leveraged buyouts, including the
biggest corporate acquisition of all time.
   But a lawsuit filed Tuesday by Jerome Kohlberg Jr., one of the
firm's founders, shows the dissension among the ranks of Kohlberg
Kravis partners and adds to the firm's growing problems four months
after it completed its record $24.53 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco
Inc.
   In the suit filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Kohlberg
alleged the firm reduced his stake in several companies that were
acquired while he was one of KKR's general partners. Kohlberg claims
that violated an agreement he made with the firm when he left its
management in 1987.
   The suit names as defendants Kohlberg Kravis, its KKR Associates
arm and the firm's two other founders, Henry R. Kravis and George R.
Roberts.
   Kohlberg alleged the defendants ``determined to secure and
transfer ...a portion of Kohlberg's interests with respect to these
companies to themselves or other KKR personnel and-or persons or
entities which they chose.''
   The firm denied Kohlberg's allegations in a statement:
   ``We are saddened that Mr. Kohlberg felt it necessary to sue his
partners and KKR. We belive he is wrong, both as to the facts and
his interpretation of the agreement between us and we fully expect
to prevail in court.''
   The suit comes as Kohlberg Kravis, a superstar in mergers and
acquisitions and the leader among leveraged buyout firms, has run
into difficulties with some of its properties.
   Leveraged buyouts are deals financed mainly with borrowed money
that is repaid with the acquired company's cash flow or the sale of
its assets.
   The firm, whose operations long have been a mystery to the
public, reportedly has had trouble selling some of its businesses
and several others either are foundering or have been disappointing
investments.
   For example, New York-based Seaman's Furniture Co., which went
private in a $360 million Kohlberg Kravis-engineered LBO two years
ago, has said it must renegotiate debt payments, partly because
sales growth has not met expectations.
   Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts formed their partnership in 1976,
with each of the three serving as general partners who managed the
firm and directed its acquisitions and investments.
   Kohlberg remained a general partner until 1987, when after a
falling-out with Kravis and Roberts over the firm's strategy he
became a limited partner, sharing in Kohlberg Kravis' profits but
not in its management.
   Among the deals undertaken while Kohlberg was a general partner
were the 1986 LBOs of consumer products giant Beatrice Cos. for $6.1
billion and the grocery chain Safeway Stores Inc. for $4.2 billion.
   Kohlberg claims that under his 1987 agreement with the firm he
was supposed to maintain his previously allocated stakes in
companies that KKR acquired while he was still a general partner. In
several cases, his interest has been reduced, his suit alleged.
   The suit involves Kohlberg's investment in several Kohlberg
Kravis properties:
   _Marley Co., acquired in a 1981 LBO. The company manufactures
heat exchange and fluid handling equipment such as boilers and
cooling towers.
   _Houdaille Industries Inc., an industrial products manufacturer,
acquired in a 1979 LBO.
   _Idex Corp., formed last year as a holding company for six
Houdaille subsidiaries.
   _Pacific Realty Associates, a real estate investment partnership
acquired in a 1983 LBO.
   _M&amp;T Inc., acquired in a 1985 LBO, another real estate concern.
   _PacTrust Realty Inc., formed in 1988 as a holding company for
M&amp;T and Pacific Realty.
   For example, the complaint said, Kohlberg Kravis decided in June
1988 to recapitalize Marley through the redemption of debt and the
purchase of equity interests in Marley of limited partners and other
investors.
   The recapitalization was accomplished through loans from
financial institutions and the investment of additional capital by
Kohlberg Kravis partners and other investors, the complaint read.
   ``In this connection, KKR has informed Kohlberg that his interest
in KKR's investment in the Marley leveraged buyout transaction made
in 1981 would be reduced from 32 percent to 17.625 percent, or by
almost one-half'' in violation of the 1987 agreement, the complaint
said.
   The complaintdemanded that Kohlberg Kravis restore to Kohlberg
the interest in the companies as provided for in the 1987 agreement
and that the court prohibit the defendants from reducing Kohlberg's
stake in other companies in violation of the agreement.
   KKR's other general partners, Robert MacDonnell, Paul Raether and
Michael Michelson, were not named as defendants in the suit.
   Kohlberg Kravis' limited partners include its investors, among
them corporate and state pension funds. These investors _ who also
were not named in Kohlberg's suit _ help supply the equity for
buyouts undertaken by the firm.

   The stock market ended modestly higher Wednesday
after a seesaw session in which prices were pushed up and down by
program trading.
   Continuing takeover speculation kept several airline stocks aloft
and also benefited share prices of a few other companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which bounced between
double-digit gains and losses, finished ahead by 1.52 points at
2,728.15.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 11 to 9 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
795 up, 650 down and 537 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 174.35 million
shares, little different from the 175.21 million shares traded in
the previous session.
   The market sported moderate gains in the morning before rounds of
futures-related program selling rocked stocks in the afternoon and
temporarly knocked down share prices.
   Stock prices bobbed back up, however, amid renewed buying when
traders seized oppportunities to profit from the price difference
between stock-index futures and actual stocks.
   A government report that furnished further evidence of economic
health failed to have much impact on Wall Street. The Commerce
Department said U.S. personal income rose 0.7 percent in July, the
best gain in four months, while consumer spending climbed at its
fastest pace since April, up 0.7 percent.
   With the economy apparently doing better than previously
believed, it is much less likely that the Federal Reserve Board will
nudge interest rates lower to stimulate growth, analysts say.
   An upward revision in the gross national product, the broadest
measure of the economy's performance, reported Tuesday already had
diminished hopes that the central bank would cut interest rates.
   The Commerce Department said the GNP grew by 2.7 percent from
April through July, a significant change from the 1.7 percent growth
rate originally reported last month.
   The Big Board's most heavily traded share was Upjohn which was
bid higher amid talk that a foreign firm might be interested in
acquiring the drug company but Upjohn said there was no corporate
news to account for the heavy trading. Upjohn jumped 2} to 41[ on
volume of nearly 4.6 million shares.
   Takeover speculation continued to steer investors toward airline
stocks. AMR, parent of American Airlines, spurted another 1\ to 92},
adding to Tuesday's gain of 10\. AMR reportedly has hired investment
banks to help defend itself against unwanted suitors.
   Pan Am was up [ at 4[, Delta rose 1} to 84, UAL, owner of United
Airlines, rose 2} to 280 and Southwest Airlines gained 1} to 30\.
   Among the actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose } to
163{ on word of a 22.2 percent increase in its dividend and a
four-for-one stock split.
   Othe active blue chips included: General Motors, up 1| to 48};
International Business Machines, up { to 116~; Exxon, up [ at 43~;
General Electric, down \ at 58; and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
up | at 40.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 204.997 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $8.33 billion, or 0.24
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.44 to 194.91.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index went up by 0.86 to 401.92, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.81 to 350.65.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market went
up 1.70 to 468.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 381.58, up 0.64.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Rise as Demand for Heating Oil Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increased demand for home heating oil helped
boost prices for energy futures across the board Wednesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
heating oil rose 0.94 cent to close at 53.11 cents a gallon after
rising 0.45 cent on Tuesday.
   Demand for heating oil surged after an American Petroleum
Institute supply report issued late Tuesday indicated that
inventories of the fuel did not increase as expected, said Andrew
Lebow, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline futures also rose, continuing the
momentum begun in Tuesday's session. Gasoline for September delivery
picked up 0.39 cent to close at 55.00 cents a gallon, adding to a
0.96 cent advance Tuesday.
   ``The rising (refined) products market helped to bring crude
up,'' Lebow said. More crude oil is needed when demand for heating
oil and gasoline increases.
   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 19 cents to settle at $18.83 a barrel
after having closed unchanged on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Kellogg Introduces New Cereal It Claims Lowers Cholesterol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co., trying to take advantage of
consumers' increasing concerns about health, on Wednesday entered
the growing market for foods that purportedly lower cholesterol.
   Kellogg at a news conference unveiled a new cereal, Heartwise,
which contains oat bran and psyllium. The two grains are high in
soluble fiber, which is believed to help the body rid itself of
cholesterol.
   High levels of cholesterol have been shown to increase the risk
of heart disease.
   In introducing its new product, which is expected to reach stores
in the fall, Kellogg is challenging one of its biggest competitors,
General Mills Inc., whose Benefit cereal contains the same
ingredients.
   Kellogg said it would spend $40 million in the first year to
advertise and promote the new cereal. It will be marketed nationwide.
   A variety of oat bran products have exploded onto the market
since researchers said the grain could help reduce cholesterol
levels. But psyllium, a grain grown mainly in India, is a relative
newcomer in terms of foods connected with healthy hearts, although
it has been used for years in laxatives such as Procter &amp; Gamble
Co.'s Metamucil.
   The outer husk of psyllium contains soluble fiber that has been
shown to reduce cholesterol, the cereal makers claim.
   General Mills' promotion of Benefit has been challenged by
Procter &amp; Gamble, which was ordered by the Food and Drug
Administration to refrain from advertising health claims for
Metamucil. Procter &amp; Gamble contends psyllium is a drug and should
be regulated by the FDA.
   However, the FDA, instead of declaring psyllium a drug _ and
thereby forcing companies to undergo lengthy approval procedures _
is developing a regulation governing health claims on product labels
including foods such as cereal.
   Other cereals made by Kellogg, based in Battle Creek Mich.,
include Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies.
   Heartwise will be targeted to consumers age 35 and older, but
Kellogg is planning an advertising campaign that promotes the
cereal's benefits for children as well as adults.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Rebound on New Strike Concerns</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS last graf to change to October WTI quote, sted September.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices rebounded Wednesday on news of a strike
vote by workers at a Chilean Copper Corp. mine, but gains were
tempered by reports that labor troubles elsewhere may be easing.
   On other futures markets, frozen pork belly prices remained
strong; cattle and hog prices were mostly lower; wheat futures fell;
corn and soybeans were mixed; precious metals declined; and oil
futures rallied.
   In trading at the New York Commodity Exchange, copper settled 1
cent to 1.85 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in
September at $1.29 a pound.
   The market's strong tone came from reports that workers at
Chilean Copper's El Salvador mine voted to strike on Sept. 1, said
Stephen Platt, a metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   Although labor and management were continuing to talk after
Tuesday's vote, copper prices ``closed firm over that strike
uncertainty,'' Platt said.
   Still, the market failed to regain the strength it had shown
before Tuesday's collapse, when prices settled at least 7 cents
lower. The settlement price Wednesday of the September contract was
just a penny higher than Tuesday's.
   Weakness stems from a feeling among traders that settlements may
be near in walkouts at Highland Valley Copper Co.'s Highland Valley
mine in British Columbia and in Peru.
   ``Most people are feeling that the supply thinness emanating from
the special situations is easing,'' Platt said.
   Gold and silver prices declined in mostly featureless trading at
the New York Commodity Exchange.
   Pressure on both metals came from the strength of the dollar,
analysts said. Gold selling also was encouraged by concerns that
Tuesday's gains ``were somewhat overdone,'' Platt said.
   Gold prices settled $1.50 to $1.80 lower, with the contract for
delivery in September at $361.80 a troy ounce; silver settled .8
cent to 1 cent lower, with the September contract at $5.085 a troy
ounce.
   Pork belly prices held strong in trading at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where cattle and hog futures were mostly lower.
   The bellies' strength was tied to rumors of possible export sales
of U.S. pork to Poland, while gains were tempered by a lack of
strong market fundamentals.
   Supplies remain abundant, and there's been no sign that lobbying
by pork producers has persuaded the Bush administration to include
pork in ``in whatever charity package we're going to be sending to
Poland,'' said Phillip Stanley, a livestock consultant in Chicago
with DEC Futures Inc.
   ``We bought the rumor ... we haven't necessarily sold the fact,''
he said. ``The market wants to see something in writing. The ball
definitely rests in the adminstration's hands.''
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to 1.05 cents lower with the

   Wheat futures dipped while corn and soybeans were mixed in
trading at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Weather concerns kept a lid on prices, as the National Weather

   In addition, more rain is expected to move into the Midwest by

analysts said.

   Americans' personal incomes rose a brisk 0.7
percent in July while consumer spending climbed at the fastest rate
since April, the government said Wednesday in a report providing
more good news about the country's economic prospects.
   The Commerce Department said the rise in incomes, fueled by rapid
growth in wages and salaries, was the biggest monthly gain since a 1
percent increase in March.
   The department said that consumer spending also posted a 0.7
percent increase last month, the fastest advance since a 1.2 percent
rise in April.
   The government also made significant revisions to previous months
showing that income growth and consumer spending were not as
sluggish as previously believed.
   Private economists said the combination of the strong July
increases and the upward revisions in earlier months showed that the
current economic expansion, which this month became the second
longest in U.S. history, was picking up steam.
   Just a month ago, there were widespread fears that just the
reverse was occurring, with many analysts predicting, on the basis
of weak reports, that the country was in danger of toppling into a
recession.
   ``The economy was not nearly as weak in the spring,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, senior economist at the New York brokerage firm of
Merrill Lynch. ``The image of an economy on the verge of a recession
has been changed by these revisions.''
   The government on Tuesday significantly revised upward its
estimate of total economic growth, putting the increase in the gross
national product from April through June at a healthy 2.7 percent
annual rate instead of the anemic 1.7 percent rate reported a month
ago.
   Most of the upward revision in GNP growth came from a doubling of
the estimate of how much consumers spent during the April-June
quarter.
   Wednesday's report showed that consumer spending was even
stronger in July, primarily because of a surge in sales of autos
spurred by incentive sales programs aimed at reducing a high
inventory of unsold cars.
   With car sales remaining strong in August, analysts looked for
total consumer spending this quarter to surpass the second quarter
pace. Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total
economic activity, that would be good news for the economy.
   Steinberg cautioned, however, that the steep discounting to
reduce car inventories and buyer concerns about announced price
hikes on the 1990 models would very likely translate into lackluster
car sales in the final three months of the year and depress consumer
spending during that quarter.
   But Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a
Washington consulting firm, said that she expected other areas, such
as sales of clothing and consumer electronics and more travel
spending, to take up the slack from an expected drop in car sales.
   ``We have had some startling revisions in the economic data which
have chased away the recession fears and put a whole different look
on the strength of the marketplace,'' she said. ``Consumer spending
was twice as strong as we earlier thought and that strength seems to
be continuing.''
   The Bush administration is predicting that the economy should
grow this year by a healthy 2.9 percent, a rate that private
economists are now agreeing is well within reach.
   The current recovery from the 1981-82 recession, which is already
the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history, entered its 81st
month in August, surpassing the 80-month-long recovery from June
1938 to February 1945, which occurred during World War II. The
recovery period actually began in July 1938.
   The only longer expansion in U.S. history is the 106-month-long
recovery from February 1961 to December 1969, which occurred during
the Vietnam War.
   The 0.7 percent rise in consumer spending in July followed a much
weaker 0.2 percent June increase. The 0.7 percent income rise
followed a 0.5 percent June increase.
   The July report showed that Americans' income after taxes also
rose 0.7 percent in July, down slightly from a 0.8 percent after-tax
increase in June.
   With incomes growing at the same rate as spending in July,
Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable income,
held steady at 5.7 percent. This matched the June level and was the
highest level for savings since a 6.2 percent rate in March.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
increased by $25.4 billion in July, up substantially from a $17.6
billion June increase, reflecting widespread gains in all employment
categories.
   On the spending side, the $25.4 billion rise in personal
consumption spending followed a a $6.6 billion June advance.
Purchases of durable goods, items such as cars which are expected to
last three or more years, jumped $7.6 billion, up from a $2.6
billion June increase.
   Overall, personal consumption spending, which includes everything
except interest payments on debt, came in at an annual rate of $3.48
trillion in July. Personal incomes totaled $4.50 trillion at an
annual rate in July.

<HEAD>Stock Exchange Amends Proposal for Stock Baskets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, facing a ban
on ``stock basket'' trading, announced Wednesday it filed documents
to clarify that the investments are securities, not futures
contracts.
   The amended proposal filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission was in response to an Aug. 18 decision by the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, which halted trading in stock
baskets, investments based on the value of broad market indexes.
   The court said the SEC erred last May in approving stock baskets,
also known as cash index participation shares, because they do not
fall under the SEC's jurisdiction. The court classified the
investments not as stocks but as futures contracts, which fall under
the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   In addition to the Philadelphia exchange, the American Stock
Exchange and the Chicago Board of Options Exchange have traded stock
baskets for several months.
   According to a news release from the Philadelphia exchange, the
new filing contains proposals that will allow investors who buy or
sell stock baskets to sell their shares at any time without any
penalty.
   Previously, investors were charged a penalty unless the sales
came at the end of a quarter.
   Also under the new filing, those investors selling the
instruments will receive a price that reflects the value of the
underlying stocks at the opening of the market that day, rather than
at the previous day's close.
   ``These changes are in line with the ruling of the 7th Circuit
Court and should remove once and for all the obstacles that stand
before us,'' said Nicholas A. Giordano, the exchange's president.
   The Philadelphia exchange first sought SEC approval for stock
baskets in March 1988.
   Baskets are priced to reflect changes in indexes such as the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks. Investors receive quarterly cash payments equal
to a proportionate share of any regular cash dividends declared on
the stocks in the index.

<HEAD>Jake Butcher, Wilson, Hit With New Fraud Indictment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Tennessee gubernatorial nominee Jake
Butcher, already serving 20 years in prison for bank fraud, was hit
Wednesday with a new federal indictment accusing him of receiving
illegal bank loans.
   Indicted along with Butcher was his one-time partner, Earl D.
Wilson, currently serving a 10-year bank fraud term, Wilson's wife
Harriette, and nine other people.
   ``We feel the alleged criminal acts represent utter contempt for
the criminal justice system,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert W. Genzman
of the Middle District of Florida.
   Named as an unindicted co-conspirator was Joe F. Justice, the
imprisoned former president of the Florida Center Bank of Orlando,
which went out of business in 1986.
   Genzman called the case ``round three of a continuing
investigation into the collapse of the bank.''
   The 51-count indictment accuses the defendants of involvement in
a scheme to obtain $3.5 million from ``nominee borrowers'' for
Butcher and Wilson after they had declared bankruptcy in 1984 and
1985. They were also facing a federal fraud investigation in
Tennessee relating to the collapse of their banking empire.
   Justice allegedly accepted $75,000 in kickbacks to arrange the
loans from Florida Center Bank. The loans were nominally for other
bank clients, but were actually delivered to Butcher and the
Wilsons, according to the indictment.
   The indictment includes counts of making false statements on loan
applications, bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and
misapplication of funds.
   Genzman said prosecutors anticipate having all the defendants
present for arraignment within 12 days.
   Butcher could face a maximum 71 years in prison and fines of $4.5
million on the charges, while Wilson faces 126 years and $8 million
in fines. Mrs. Wilson, who lives in Longwood, could be sentenced to
57 years and a fine of $3.5 million.
   Also indicted were Allen L. ``Red Dog'' Hicks, of Knoxville,
Tenn.; David Ogle, also of Knoxville; Michael R. Allen, of Altamonte
Springs; Frederick C. Streck, of Atlanta, James P. Gresham and his
girlfriend Sandra K. Chitwood, both also of Atlanta; Harold G. and
Margaret F. Artrip, of Longwood and Michael F. Thomas, of
Cookeville, Tenn.

   Leona Helmsley, the persnickety hotel queen
quoted as saying ``only the little people pay taxes,'' was convicted
Wednesday of evading $1.2 million in income tax by charging personal
expenses to her business empire.
   The federal jury acquitted Mrs. Helmsley, 69, of the most serious
charge against her _ conspiring to extort payoffs from vendors.
   Pictured as a regal perfectionist in ads for Helmsley luxury
hotels, Mrs. Helmsley was portrayed in court as an abusive,
penny-pinching tyrant _ part of a defense strategy of arguing she
was the victim of spiteful ex-employees.
   In opening arguments, her own lawyer labeled her ``a tough
bitch.''
   Mrs. Helmsley shook her head while listening to the litany of
guilty verdicts on 33 of 41 counts. Former aides Frank Turco and
Joseph Licari were convicted of assisting in the tax-evasion scheme.
   She walked past hundreds of reporters, photographers and
bystanders on the courthouse steps, got into a limousine and
departed without comment.
   ``Of course, we'll appeal,'' said Joseph Benfante, lawyer for
Licari.
   Mrs. Helmsley remains free pending sentencing Nov. 14. Each of
the 33 counts carries either three or five years in prison. She also
faces fines up to $8 million.
   The jury found Mrs. Helmsley evaded federal taxes from 1983
through 1985, most of it by billing $3.1 million in expenses from
the Helmsleys' Greenwich, Conn., mansion, Dunnellen Hall, to their
hotel and real estate business.
   Among the expenses were more than $1 million for a pool enclosure
with a marble dance floor; jade figures worth $500,000; a $130,000
indoor-outdoor sound system similar to one Mrs. Helmsley had admired
at Disney World, and thousands of dollars in landscaping.
   ``Today's verdicts should widely serve as a reminder that no one,
regardless of how wealthy or how well-insulated by underlings, under
the law is free to flaunt the tax laws,'' said U.S. Attorney Benito
Romano.
   He said it was too early to say what sentence prosecutors would
seek.
   ``We gave a very fair verdict. It was very hard,'' said David
Samuel, a member of the jury that deliberated for five days.
   Mrs. Helmsley and her husband, Harry, still face prosecution on
charges of evading state taxes; no trial date has been set.
   Helmsley, 80, heads a $5 billion empire that includes 27 hotels _
the Helmsley hotels in New York City and the Cleveland-based Harley
chain. He was indicted with his wife in 1988 but was found mentally
incompetent to stand trial.
   In addition to expenses at Dunnellen Hall, prosecutors alleged
that $320,172 in Mrs. Helmsley's personal purchases, including
thousands of dollars in designer clothing, were charged to the Park
Lane Hotel in New York.
   Another item was a $45,000 silver clock in the shape of the
Helmsley Building, a birthday present to Harry Helmsley from his
wife.
   His wife's image took a beating at the trial. Already described
as a finicky ``queen'' in Helmsley ads, she was depicted as arrogant
and mean-spirited.
   Her former housekeeper testified that Mrs. Helmsley once told
her, ``We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.''
   Many of the 44 prosecution witnesses during the eight-week trial
described how she fired employees at the slightest provocation and
disputed bills.
   Defense attorney Gerald Feffer sought to discredit the witnesses
as disgruntled ex-employees.
   He also noted the Helmsleys paid $57.8 million in taxes during
the time covered by the indictment and argued the couple did nothing
wrong in billing Dunnellen Hall expenses to their business because
they used the estate for business.

<HEAD>Bank Admits Urging Clients to Buy Stock During Merger Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of two Japanese banks planning a major merger
admitted Wednesday it had urged its clients to buy stock in the bank
in June, but said this had no connection with the merger talks then
under way.
   ``It was intended to increase the number of stable shareholders
of the bank's stock,'' said Fukio Yamamoto, a spokesman for Taiyo
Kobe Bank.
   Mitsui Bank, the seventh-largest bank in both Japan and the
world, and Taiyo Kobe, the eighth-largest, announced Tuesday they
will merge April 1 to meet intensifying competition from domestic
and foreign banks. The new bank will be the world's second largest.
   Wednesday's disclosure triggered criticism that Taiyo Kobe Bank
was using insider information for its own advantage, but Yamamoto
said the stock campaign ``had no connection with the merger talks.''
   Taiyo Kobe has been seen as the main beneficiary of the merger in
terms of its stock price. Taiyo Kobe stock had been steady at the
equivalent of about $9.80 a share until late June, when it began
rising. It closed at $11.40 Monday, the day before the merger was
announced.
   Trading in both banks' stock was suspended Tuesday to give
investors time to digest details of the merger plan.
   On Wednesday, buy orders in anticipation of further rises in
Taiyo Kobe's stock amounted to 64 million shares, while 450,000
shares were offered for sale.
   The stock closed Wednesday at $13.50 after the maximum one-day
gain of $2.10 allowed under stock exchange rules.
   Officials of the Tokyo Stock Exchange said they would investigate
the merger, but stressed that it would be a ``routine'' probe, not
based on any suspicion that insider trading or illegality was
involved.
   Hitoshi Shimakura, head of the Transaction Inspection Division of
the world's largest exchange, said his office would look into recent
price fluctuations of both banks' stocks.
   ``The real key is when the actual decision on the merger was
made,'' he said. ``As far as insider trading laws are concerned,
anything that occurred before the final decision to merge has to be
handled separately.''
   Kenichi Suematsu, president of Mitsui Bank, told reporters at a
news conference Tuesday that the merger was formally approved by the
boards of directors of both banks on Monday. He said negotiations
for the merger began in March.
   On Wednesday, it was learned from a report compiled by the
Securities Industries Association that Shinei Ishino Securities Co.,
a brokerage affiliated with Taiyo Kobe Bank, bought 4.7 million
Taiyo Kobe shares in June and July, when merger negotiations were in
their final stage.
   Analysts said the huge purchase of Taiyo Kobe shares by
medium-size Shinei Ishino was caused by the bank's campaign to urge
its clients to buy shares. Taiyo Kobe officials said they usually
recommend that their clients use Shinei Ishino.
   Junzo Yamakawa, a vice president of Shinei Ishino, was quoted in
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a major economic newspaper, as saying his
company knew nothing about the merger before the announcement, and
it was ``entirely our customers' decision'' to buy Taiyo Kobe shares.
   ``There had been speculation that Taiyo Kobe was about to
announce an important decision because its share prices began
soaring while most other bank shares remained sluggish,'' said
Keiichi Nishida, an analyst at Kidder Peabody Securities. ``What's
clear now is that the information did leak out and apparently
affected its stock price well ahead of the announcement of the
merger.''

<HEAD>Eastern Plans to Boost Schedule, But May Be Short On Cash</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 11th graf, `George Brennan ...,' to CORRECT to 601 flights

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, nearing the seventh month of its
strike, on Wednesday said it will add another 101 daily flights Oct.
1 and is ahead of its rebuilding schedule.
   The announcement of new flights, most between Florida and
Northeast cities, came a day before Eastern officials were scheduled
to make a presentation in New York to creditors on their rebuilding
plan. While Eastern says it's making good progress on efforts to
rebuild without its unions, The Wall Street Journal reported
Wednesday that Eastern faces $400 million in revenue shortfalls and
may have to revise its plan for emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
   ``We do have a meeting with the creditors and we'll give them an
overall status report,'' said Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
She declined to comment further, but said ``one thing that hasn't
changed is that the creditors will all be paid.''
   The Journal, quoting unidentified sources, said parent Texas Air
Corp. may underwrite some of Eastern's operations because Eastern's
negotiations with rival American Airlines on the sale of Latin
American routes have stalled. The sale had been expected to bring in
as much as $400 million for Miami-based Eastern.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said recently the carrier may not
sell the full $1.8 billion in assets envisaged in its original
rebuilding plan, and he said the coveted Latin American routes
wouldn't necessarily be sold.
   While Bakes said Eastern intends to be bigger than first planned,
union officials say the effort to rebuild since the strike began
March 4 is foundering.
   ``Obviously this is a setback for (Texas Air Chairman Frank)
Lorenzo and the creditors,'' pilots union spokesman Hank Weber said.
``To say he's 20 to 25 percent short on his cash projections has to
have an unfavorable response from the creditors.''
   Referring to Eastern's planned schedule increase, Weber said: ``I
don't know where they will get the aircraft.''
   He said Eastern, whose pilots, Machinists and flight attendants
unions remain on strike and hope for a new owner, is falling behind
on aircraft maintenance.
   Weber said the pilots union is exploring bringing more pressure
on Lorenzo by threatening to remove $800 million in pension fund
investments from banks doing business with Texas Air. He said
details were still being worked out for the effort, which the pilots
union hopes will be joined by other unions.
   George Brennan, Eastern's vice president for marketing, said the
carrier has sufficient numbers of pilots and planes to boost its
schedule again. Eastern earlier announced it will move from 390
daily flights to 601 on Sept. 7, and Brennan said it will jump to
702 on Oct. 1.
   There will be several more additions in the month after that,
Brennan said, putting Eastern near its target _ 800 daily flights by
year's end.
   ``What this says is we're going to get the airline rebuilt faster
than we thought,'' Brennan said.
   Eastern had nearly 1,100 daily flights and 30,000 employees when
it was struck last spring. The company is now back to 12,000
employees and will have 17,000 by year's end, Brennan said.
   Eastern, which is leasing 15 planes and crews from Texas Air
sister Continental Airlines, doesn't plan to lease more from
Continental, Brennan said. He said Eastern has 155 planes of its own
to fly.
   The carrier is continuing to offer discount fares such as $79 one
way between Miami and New York, Brennan said. Although Eastern loses
money flying passengers at such low prices, he said the priority
this year is winning back customers to the rebuilding carrier.
   ``Ultimately, of course, we've got to prove we can be
profitable,'' Brennan said.
   The new schedule increases, adding new nonstop services from
Miami, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston and New York, move Eastern
close to its goal of nearly 300 flights for its Atlanta hub while
moving the rebuilding focus to its ``traditional stronghold'' in
Florida, Brennan said.

<HEAD>General Cinema Corp.'s Earnings Up 23 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Cinema Corp. said Wednesday its
earnings rose 26 percent in the three months ended July 31, in part
because of a 23 percent rise in attendance at the company's theaters.
   General Cinema said the boost in earnings also could be
attributed to improved performance by Neiman Marcus Group, a 59.9
percent-owned subsidiary whose results are consolidated with a
one-quarter lag.
   For the quarter, earnings were $25.6 million, or 35 cents a
share, on revenue of $491.3 million, compared with earnings of $21.7
million, or 30 cents a share, on revenue of $390 million for the
same period in 1988.
   The year-ago results included after-tax earnings of $19.3
million, or 26 cents a share, from operations at the company's soft
drink bottling business, which was sold in March 1989.
   The profit for the first nine months of fiscal 1989, including
after-tax income of $865.9 million from the discontinued operations,
was $98 million, or $13.06 a share, on revenue of $1.46 billion,
compared with earnings of $963.9 million, or $1.16 a share, on
revenue of $1.24 billion in the 1988 period.
   ``General Cinema Theatres benefited from an outstandinng crop of
summer pictures and reported strong gains in attendance, revenues
and operating earnings in the third quarter,'' Chairman Richard A.
Smith said in a statement.
   During the quarter, General Cinema added 28 screens and closed 10
older ones, bringing to 1,451 the number of screens at 318 theaters.

<HEAD>Cellular Phone Maker Says It Will Continue Sales Despite Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finnish phone maker Nokia Inc. said
Wednesday it would modify the two mobile telephone components a U.S.
administrative law judge said may infringe on a U.S. rival's patents.
   Nokia President Jan Loeber said it can continue selling the
cellular phones after posting a bond required by the International
Trade Commission. The ITC also set a bond for Motorola Inc. of
Schaumburg, Ill., which challenged the Nokia patent.
   Whichever company loses the patent battle loses its bond. The
amount of the bonds is confidential.
   Loeber said his company wanted to fulfill customers' orders, and
made the modifications so imports could continue. He said Nokia,
which has its North American headquarters here, is the world's
leading cellular phone maker.
   Judge John J. Mathias in Washington, D.C., recommended two weeks
ago that the commission deny Nokia's patents for two of the phone's
devices: one that lights the keypad and another that allows
circuitry to function despite internal temperature changes.
   Mathias upheld the phones' overall design, but ruled that the
patents for the two devices may infringe on Motorola's patents.
   The ITC on Tuesday ordered Nokia to stop importing the phones or
selling them without posting a bond.
   Nokia said it hopes to persuade the ITC to change its mind before
the commission's final order is issued next spring. Motorola also
challenged the patents in federal court in Chicago. That case is
pending.

<HEAD>Pickens Says He Won't Run For Governor</HEAD>

   Oilman and corporate raider T. Boone Pickens said
Wednesday he will not run for governor in 1990, but left open his
options for 1994.
   The 61-year-old Pickens said the crush of his business would not
allow him to commit 100 percent of his time to the needs of the
state.
   ``It's not the time,'' he told about 500 people at a Dallas
Rotary luncheon, ending weeks of speculation.
   Pickens said he had prepared two versions of his speech _ one
announcing his candidacy and the one he delivered. He and his wife,
Beatrice, reached their decision late Tuesday at their hotel room in
Dallas, Pickens said, and were still discussing it Wednesday morning.
   Pickens did not rule out a run in 1994. ``That's an option,'' he
said.
   Pickens would not endorse any of the Republican candidates who
would have been his rivals in the GOP primary.
   His decision not to run, Pickens said, was based on his
involvement in his Mesa Limited Partnership, Koito Manufacturing and
his United Shareholders Association.
   Mesa, an oil and gas firm, lost $13.4 million in the second
quarter and will likely post a loss in the third quarter, Pickens
said, refusing to speculate on how large the loss might be.
   He blamed the losses on declining natural gas prices. Pickens,
once feared as a corporate raider and who made a $518 million pretax
profit in a 1983 attempted takeover of Gulf Oil Corp., said it was
the first loss for the company in 16 years.
   Pickens also said he plans to continue his efforts to open up
opportunities for U.S. investment in Japan, and may
``significantly'' increase his stake in Koito Manufacturing, a
Japanese auto parts supplier.
   Pickens' Boone Co. owns 20.2 percent of Koito. Although Pickens
is Koito's largest shareholder, he has been denied a seat on the
company's board.
   He said he plans to call for a special Koito shareholders meeting
in coming weeks and will continue to work with Congress and U.S.
trade officials to ``level the playing field'' in trade and
investment with the Japanese. ``I think the Japanese are just not
playing a fair game,'' he said.
