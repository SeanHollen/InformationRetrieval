   Hurricane Hugo punched this city of
antebellum mansions with full fury and killed at least 12 people in
the Carolinas before weakening Friday and trailing off inland to the
north.
   South Carolina's barrier islands were also hit hard as houses
were blown off their foundations and boats were pushed ashore,
stacked along the beaches two and three deep.
   ``Garden City for all practical purposes is gone,'' said M.L.
Love, a Horry County administrator who toured the elite resort
community near Myrtle Beach.
   President Bush declared seven counties a federal disaster area.
   ``It is the worst storm, the worst disaster, I've ever seen
anywhere,'' said Gov. Carrolll Campbell.
   Hugo, downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m., had lost all
characteristics of tropical storm and was weakening, although the
system had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains.
   The storm's last location was in Pennsylvania, just west of
Pittsburgh, at latitude 40.5 degrees north and longitude 81 degrees
west. Officials said there would be no further tracking.
   Campbell toured his state Friday by air, stopping to assist some
people who waved him down for help.
   About 50 people in the small coastal community of McClellanville
were stranded by the storm, and some were standing on top of cars
and waving at the passing helicopter.
   Campbell's helicopter landed in a nearby baseball field, and the
governor made sure the people got help. ``There are a lot of little
places like that in this state that just got wiped out,'' Campbell
said.
   Eleven of the U.S. deaths were in South Carolina, said Warren
Hardy of the state's Office of Emergency Preparedness. The South
Carolina deaths included an elderly man found in the rubble of a
house in Charleston, and a power company employee who was
electrocuted Friday as he worked to restore electricity. In North
Carolina, a 6-month-old baby was killed in Union County when a tree
fell on a house.
   The center of the storm advanced farther west than expected,
targeting eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and western New York
before it was expected to wear itself out in Canada. It was moving
to the north at 30 mph.
   A hurricane is a heat engine fueled by warm, moist air over open
oceans. When these giant storms hit land, they lose their wallop,
although they can still manage considerable bluster.
   Charleston, S.C., felt the full wrath of Hugo, which wrecked a
string of Caribbean resort islands beginning early Sunday. As many
as 27 people were killed in the Caribbean. About 50,000 people are
homeless.
   The city where the first shots of the Civil War were fired in
1861 was clobbered with 135 mph winds and a tidal surge of 12 to 17
feet. The storm, which at its height was as large as the state of
South Carolina, flattened 30 buildings, peeled off roofs and flooded
streets. Several people were believed trapped in a building
collapse. Officials later said no one was found inside.
   ``There's just destruction everywhere,'' said Mayor Joseph P.
Riley, who imposed a 6 p.m. curfew. He called it a ``disaster of
extraordinary dimensions.''
   Riley estimated damage at $1 billion in the city of 65,000
residents.
   National Guardsman patrolled streets, and Campbell confirmed
there was sporadic looting before authorities restored order.
   Jo Smith rode out the storm in her 100-year-old house across from
the Medical University of South Carolina, but said Friday she wished
she would have left town.
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ``The house was
shaking. I could hear pieces of tin flying off (my) roof.''
   At least 900,000 people were without power in the Carolinas,
officials said. The total included 200,000 or 85 percent of the
homes and businesses in Charlotte, N.C., which felt Hugo's muscle
even though it's 200 miles inland. The fraud and conspiracy trial of
PTL founder Jim Bakker was canceled Friday because of the storm.
   In addition to flooding, fires from natural gas leaks erupted in
low-lying Charleston, where some tree-lined streets were under
several feet of water.
   At least 20 boats washed ashore, including a 50-foot craft that
washed up on a city street, Police Chief Reuben Greenberg said.
   Most of the historic antebellum mansions facing Charleston Harbor
weathered the storm with little cosmetic damage, officials said.
   But Fort Sumter, the first Union holding fired upon by the
Confederacy at the beginning of the Civil War, suffered $1 million
damage when a 17-foot wall of water passed over it, according to
Constance Harriman, assistant secretary of the interior for parks
and wildlife.
   The Pentagon reported Friday that its Air Force base near
Charleston appears to have sustained ``catastrophic levels of
damage,'' according to a statement issued in Washington.
   Seventy miles up the coast, the elite vacation retreat community
of Garden City was smashed, officials said. It was among the
communities under an evacuation order before Hugo hit.
   Love said destruction extended ``as far as I could see.''
   On Pawleys Island, south of Myrtle Beach, authorities said at
least 14 houses had been washed away. Three piers disappeared in
North Myrtle Beach, Cherry Grove, and Garden City.
   Amy Garrison of WKZQ AM-FM said a reporter who was allowed to
tour the islands with civil defense personnel said houses were
sitting in the middle of the road, roads were washed away and trees
and power lines were down.
   Refrigerators, air conditioners and washers and dryers were
floating in the streets. Stairways that lead down to the beach were
sitting in the streets.
   Barrier islands, which were ordered evacuated on Thursday, were
pummeled and flooded. Jack Sellers, a pilot from Columbia who flew
people to the coast to look at their property, said Pawleys Island
had about a 100-to-200-foot wide swath cut through it.
   ``There are now two Pawleys Islands, if you will,'' Sellers said.
   He said two houses that had been on the beachfront were sitting
300 yards or 400 yards away in a marsh.
   Bush's disaster declaration makes federal aid available for such
things as temporary housing, low-cost loans for rebuilding and
grants for repairing roads, bridges and other public structures.
   Hurricane-force winds first hit the South Carolina coast at 9:15
p.m. Thursday. It was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston
since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.
   The eye passed over Charleston about midnight. A wall of water
gushed into City Hall when a chunk of roof on the 188-year-old brick
building blew away during the storm. Phone and electric service to
the city's command post was knocked out.
   ``We've just been flattened,'' said Jerry Stafford, a spokesman
for Santee Cooper Electric Co. ``One building just peeled open like
a can opener.''

   An abandon-ship drill has been revised on
the recommendation of investigators probing the death of an aviation
officer candidate in a training pool, a Navy spokesman said Thursday.
   The changes were made although the Navy found no wrongdoing or
safety shortcomings in the June 23 death of Michael Fedie at
Pensacola Naval Air Station, said Cmdr. Dennis Hessler.
   Fedie, 22, of Altoona, Wis., died from an unexplained seizure
accompanied by acute cerebral edema, a swelling and excess of fluid
in the brain, an autopsy report concluded.
   He collapsed as he was walking from the pool after jumping off a
12-foot tower and swimming 15 yards underwater to simulate efforts
to avoid burning fuel on the surface surrounding a sinking ship.
   Fedie and other students first completed the drill wearing only
swimming suits and then did it again in flight suits and boots
before Fedie collapsed.
   One change adds an interim jump while wearing flight suits but no
boots and another is to have the students swim in flight suits and
boots to get a feel for what it is like before jumping from the
tower, said Hessler, spokesman for the Pensacola-based Naval
Education and Training Command.
   As an added precaution, students have been jumping from the side
of the pool instead of the tower since Fedie's death, but Hessler
said he expects the tower jump will be reinstated.
   Another recommendation that has been adopted is a daily check of
the telephone at the pool. The phone was working on the day Fedie
collapsed, Hessler said.
   The changes were unrelated to the cause of Fedie's death but were
among recommendations that the judge advocate general's office will
make in a final report.
   Those three recommendations were passed on to the Naval Aviation
Schools Command ahead of the report's release, which is expected
soon. Hessler said additional recommendations are expected in the
report.
   The changes affect only the aviation program at Pensacola
although similar drills are conducted for non-aviation trainees at
other bases, Hessler said.
   The death of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis.,
on March 2, 1988, triggered changes in procedure for training rescue
swimmers who jump from helicopters to aid downed airmen.
   Mirecki drowned after suffering fear-induced heart failure, a
pathologist testified at the court-martial of an instructor who was
convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to 90 days in the brig.

<HEAD>Fifteen-Year-Old Pleads Guilty, Waives Trial In Four Killings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old former high school football
player accused in four neighborhood murders over the past two years
waived his right to a trial Thursday and will serve six years in
reform school.
   The sentence is the maximum Craig Price could have received, even
if he had been found guilty in a trial, according to state laws
concerning minors. He also pleaded guilty to two burglary charges.
   Price goes to the strictest section of the Rhode Island Training
School almost three weeks after the bodies of Joan Heaton, 39, and
her two daughters _ Melissa, 8, and Jennifer, 10 _ were discovered
on Labor Day in their home here.
   Price lived two blocks away from the Heatons and two doors from
the house where Rebecca A. Spencer was killed in 1987. Price
admitted to killing all four in taped confessions, said state
prosector Jeffrey Pine.
   The youth stared at the table in front of him as Family Court
Judge Carmine DePatrillo told him that by pleading guilty to
deliquency by first-degree murder and burglary he would have no
court hearing chance to challenge any evidence, witnesses or give
testimony in court.
   Attorney General James E. O'Neil said after Price was taken away
that he felt no special relief at watching the youth go to the
state's juvenile prison.
   ``This is not a type of situation where you sit back and achieve
any degree of satisfaction,'' O'Neil said. ``It's just wasted human
lives.''
   He said he was frustrated because Price will only serve time
until his 21st birthday _ which he would have if he had been found
guilty in a trial.
   Investigators said the 240-pound Price, a former high school
football player known as ``Iron Man'' who was repeating the ninth
grade, never showed any remorse for the killings.
   All three Heatons had been beaten to death, and were stabbed
repeatedly.
   Spencer, who was killed in July 1987, was stabbed 58 times,
police said. Blanchard and Capt. Ronald Carter, who headed the
investigation, both said they suspected the same person in all the
killings.

   British filmmaker-playwright David Hare thinks
American love stories are unrealistic and says his latest work,
``Strapless,'' with Blair Brown and Bridget Fonda, is more
believable than current Hollywood fare.
   ``Strapless'' will have its premiere at the New York Film
Festival.
   After a screening of ``Strapless'' this week, Hare attacked Rob
Reiner's hit movie, ``When Harry Met Sally... ,'' for failing to
integrate the lead characters into the outside world.
   ``At no point was there any reference to the characters' jobs, or
to what their relationships were outside dating,'' said Hare. ``They
were people who dated, that was their primary social function. They
either were happy or unhappy according to whether they were dating.
   ``It's this way of looking at the world through people who exist
in rooms, and the minute the door closes, everything that is the
world is shut out of that room and you are simply together eating
lasagna or spaghetti or whatever kind of pasta the scene is about,''
he said.
   In ``Strapless,'' Brown stars as a 40-year-old American doctor
working in a London hospital and living with her rebellious younger
sister (Fonda). While on holiday, Brown is pursued by a romantic
entrepreneur (Bruno Ganz), who follows her back to London and
eventually persuades her to marry him.
   But Ganz, substantially in debt, suddenly flees and Brown is
forced to put her life back together again and provide support for
Fonda, who has become pregnant after a brief affair.
   Hare, who also wrote the screenplay, said he enjoyed the
challenge of creating female characters. ``There's nothing harder to
get than a member of the opposite sex. I know the benefit of writing
about women is you have such an extraordinary range of underused
actresses _ actresses able to do all sorts of things they're not
ususally given a chance to.''
   Hare also directed the 1984 drama ``Wetherby,'' and wrote the
play and screenplay ``Plenty.'' Meryl Streep starred in the film
version.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia's crackdown on its cocaine cartels has
reached as far as the streets of Lima, where a sudden shortage of
drug money has sparked wild speculation in dollars.
   In the month since Colombia declared war on drug traffickers,
visits by Colombian narcotics smugglers to Peru's Upper Huallaga
river valley, source of most of the world's coca leaf, have dropped
80 percent, according to analysts. The illegal trade is believed to
bring at least $1 billion a year to Peru's dollar-starved economy,
most of it via the northeastern highland jungles where 60,000
peasant families grow the world's best-quality coca.
   Colombian traffickers fly into remote airstrips scattered through
the region and pay cash dollars for coca paste, which they refine
into cocaine.
   The drug dollars then travel in chartered planes and trucks over
the Andes, which separate the jungle from the coast, and are traded
for Peruvian intis on Lima's bustling black market.
   But the dollars aren't flowing as they did.
   ``The number of planes carrying dollars from the jungle has
dropped from about 15 a week to three,'' said economist Alberto
Grana, director of the magazine Actualidad Economica.
   Some have been quick to try to exploit the dollar shortage.
   In a third-floor apartment in the ritzy San Isidro suburb,
Roberto, owner of an ``underground'' money exchange house, is
juggling two telephones trying to line up a deal for $30,000.
   With a buyer on one line and a seller on the other, he's trying
to ride the rising exchange rate and take in 150 intis on the dollar
as his cut, three times the margin of a few weeks ago.
   ``The phone never stops here,'' he said.
   As he talks, people with gym bags and paper sacks stuffed with
intis shuffle in out of the apartment past a bored guard twirling
his revolver.
   Roberto, who asked that his full name not be used, has five years
in the business, and although the government legalized the black
market last year, he chose not to register to avoid regulations and
taxes.
   ``There's an incredible diversity in prices right now,'' said
Roberto, who stood to make $900 if the deal held.
   Since Aug. 19, the unofficial exchange rate at which most dollars
are sold and bought has shot from 3,300 intis to the dollar to
5,300, a 60 percent rise attributed to the scarcity of U.S. currency.
   The drug money's power can be seen in the growth of black market
trading, which has effectively turned Peru's feeble economy into one
based on dollars.
   Carrying pocket calculators and wads of bills, eager curb-side
money changers can be seen throughout the capital accosting cars and
pedestrians to make a deal. Their numbers have jumped from 300 to
more than 3,000 in just two years.
   Private exchange houses downtown set the exchange rate according
to the ebb and flow of available dollars, and street traders
throughout the city are in constant touch by telephone to know the
latest price.
   ``They said two planes with narco-dollars were coming from the
jungle yesterday, but they never appeared so the price went up,''
said Lucy Mejia, a 45-year-old unemployeed nurse who averages a
profit of $2 a day as a street corner money changer.
   The dollar has become a haven for many whose inti income is eaten
up by hyperinflation, estimated at 5,700 percent over the last 12
months. Businesses also are desperate for dollars to pay for imports.
   Even though many of the dollars come from the drug trade, ``it
doesn't mean that we live off cocaine,'' economist Guido Pennano
said recently in a television interview. ``It means that we're not
poorer because of the cocaine.''
   But because of Colombia's crackdown on cocaine trafficking,
economists are concerned about Peru's economy being cut off from one
of its biggest sources of cash.
   ``The most important impact will be an increase in the inflation
index,'' said Grana, explaining that as the dollar rises, import
costs go up.
   But political leaders frequently express concern that Peru's
economy has been weakened by years of ``narco-dependence.''
   ``The narco-traffickers are controlling certain aspects of the
national economy, and at least 25 percent of foreign exchange
earnings is fed by dollars from the drug traffic,'' said Luis
Bedoya, a leader in the center-right coalition supporting novelist
Mario Vargas Llosa for president in next April's election.

   Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with
renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in
southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on
jammed highways.
   ``This is a disaster staring us right in the eye,'' Mayor Joseph
P. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston,
where the hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and caused
utility transformers to explode.
   ``All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have
taken have been sufficient,'' Riley said as Hugo's eye bore in on
the city. ``I just hope and pray we can get through this without any
loss of life.''
   By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston. The roof
cracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that has
withstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water poured into the
paneled council chamber. Phone and electric service to the command
post was knocked out.
   Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, and
about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle of
Palms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   The eye was about 10 miles across and top winds were still at 135
mph.
   Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severe
flooding as it moved up the East Coast. The storm posed a 19 percent
chance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hitting
Boston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said.
   As Hugo neared the coast, roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach,
200 miles north, were nearly empty, as were the boarded-up resort
towns themselves. Power lines and trees were downed in some spots
and water flooded roads. Stop lights and neon lights were knocked
out in Myrtle Beach.
   ``One eyewitness said `It's like a light show,''' said Amy
Garrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach.
   In Charleston, the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs,
palmetto fronds and chunks of bark. Businesses were closed and
classes at public schools and universities canceled. Riley ordered
residents of one-story homes to evacuate.
   Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharging any patients well
enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for
emergency patients, officials said.
   About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the state
as of Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown,
a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220
miles northwest of here.
   ``We tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side
doors,'' said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse working at the
Conway High School shelter near Myrtle Beach. ``We tried to post
guards at the doors, but people were still coming in.''
   American Red Cross relief efforts were buckling under the number
of evacuees, said Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., who
appealed for help.
   ``Right now the Red Cross is sheltering tens of thousands of
people all along the Eastern seaboard. This of course is at the same
time that we're sheltering 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and the
other Caribbean islands.
   ``We're beginning to feel the squeeze. Our resources are very
tight. Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest relief
operations of the decade.''
   At midnight, the center of Hugo was near latitude 32.7 degrees
north and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said. The
hurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.
   Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds of 135 mph, up from
125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before. North and
South Carolina can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next two
days, according to the hurricane center.
   The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12
hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said. A hurricane warning
was in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.
   By late afternoon, Hugo was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane on
the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category,
which indicated it could cause extreme damage.
   ``It strengthened more than we thought it would,'' Sheets said,
adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the
Appalachians.
   The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's
tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a
normal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m.
   ``On top of that will be waves,'' Sheets said earlier, and in
many places on barrier islands ``the buildings will be swept clean
off.''

   The likelihood that someone put a bomb aboard a
French jetliner in an African backwater, killing 171 people, kindled
fresh fears among specialists over aircraft vulnerability.
   Worldwide, according to the International Air Transport
Association, 900 to 1,000 scheduled airlines serve 5,000 to 6,000
airports. Security is all but absent in many of the airports.
   Experts scrutinize major airports after fatal incidents, but
otherwise airport security is left to national authorities, with
almost no international oversight.
   ``This is the problem with security,'' said John Brindley, a
Transport Association spokesman. ``It's like night guards at a bank.
After you've been robbed, you realize you need three guards instead
of two.''
   If terrorists target airports where security is lax, he said,
echoing concerns of others interviewed, the cost of protecting
flights could be far higher than once believed.
   The problem goes far beyond screening passengers and baggage.
   In many African airports, for example, outsiders can roam
unchallenged around parked aircraft. Most have VIP lounges from
which officials and their retinues walk directly to boarding doors.
   Frequent travelers report broken X-ray equipment, lackadaisical
searches and even instances where small bribes allow passengers to
skirt time-consuming security checks.
   Sometimes only cursory checks are made of baggage handlers,
caterers and cleaners.
   One African who recently transited Brazzaville, Congo, on
business described his experience on the condition he not be
identified.
   ``I walked through the electronic gate, forgetting a large bunch
of keys in my pocket. Nothing sounded, and the policeman in charge
waved me through. But that is not unusual in Africa,'' he said.
   After the crash Tuesday of UTA Flight 772 in the Niger desert,
airline president Rene Lapautre said he felt some African airports
had ``fragile'' security measures.
   He was asked if that included Brazzaville, from where the UTA
flight originated. ``Let us be frank, yes,'' he told French
television.
   Lapautre said only the combined efforts of police, airport
authorities and airlines could reduce the risk to passengers.
   ``It's not just Africa,'' Brindley said. ``Not much is going on
in Reykjavik (Iceland) or Adelaide (Australia), say, so people might
be a little more relaxed.''
   Benjamin Demps, U.S. Federal Aviation Administration director for
Europe, Africa and the Middle East, refused comment on the UTA
accident but agreed in general with Brindley.
   ``We know there are airports around the world not up to speed in
security measures,'' he said, adding concern that international
authorities had little leverage to correct some weaknesses.
   ``Air travel is inextricably international,'' Demps said. ``We
must think of it as international and remove ourselves from the
`my-problem your-problem' mentality.''
   Bernard Adamczewski, deputy director of the London-based
Institute for Terrorist Studies, concurred that governments had to
transcend national sovereignty to counter growing threats.
   ``All terrorist organizations have masses of time on their hands
for detailed reconnaisance of security measures,'' he said. ``We can
expect much greater degrees of sophistication from them.''
   Pilots' associations are especially worried, but most accept the
reality of a massive challenge.
   ``We must be concerned,'' said Group Capt. John Tritton of
Britain's Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators. ``But if a
terrorist is determined enough, there is very little you can do.''
   He agreed that governments had to unite to deny safe havens to
hijackers and to coordinate investigations. But he feared the public
will could wane in the face of the overall cost.
   ``My experience is that after an incident, security becomes very
severe,'' Tritton said. ``Then as memories dim, it gets less and
less precise.''
   Frequent travelers tend to agree.
   After a Pan Am jumbo jet was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland,
last December, U.S. airlines imposed strict new security on all
trans-Atlantic routes.
   The bomb was traced to a tape recorder, and U.S. authorities
contemplated measures including a ban on carrying electronic items
aboard aircraft. Such appliances were to be inspected by hand.
   But passengers now find that busy security agents frequently
ignore the X-ray images of portable computers, large radios and
other gear in carry-on luggage.
   Acknowledging this, Tritton said, ``Memories are short. It's
human nature.''

   It's official. U.S. and Soviet spacemen are
going to Mars, and the Martians can't wait to greet them.
   That's Mars, Pa. 16046. U.S.A. Earth.
   Soviet Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev arrives in Mars on Monday, by
jetliner and car, for an eight-day visit to this community of about
1,800 humanoids about 25 miles north of Pittsburgh.
   Krikalev, 31, a flight engineer, spent five months on a
Soviet-French Soyuz mission that ended in April. He will be joined
Wednesday by Navy Lt. Cmdr. Mario Runco Jr., 37, a NASA astronaut
who is awaiting assignment to a space shuttle flight.
   The spacemen's mission is to teach Martian children about space
and Soviet-American friendship at school lunches and assemblies.
   Organizers say it's just like Martians, as some residents call
themselves, to do something spacey like this.
   ``It just seems natural when you live close to Mars. People here
have a lot of pride that our town is named after a planet,'' said
Bonnie Solino, mother of a 13-year-old boy and the first Martian to
invite spacemen to this sector of the solar system.
   ``Frankly, I'm a little perplexed by all this, but then I'm
originally from the New York City area,'' she admitted Thursday.
   Ralph Terrell, a retired chemist and chairman of the Mars Area
Foundation for Educational Excellence, a private group organizing
the event for the school district, said Thursday you have to have a
sense of humor to live in Mars.
   ``The school team is called the Mars Planets. We have the Mars
National Bank that gives service out of this world. There's an
undercurrent, but nobody had really glorified it until we stumbled
upon this,'' Terrell said.
   ``I'm even thinking of having cards printed up that say, `I
talked to a Martian today,''' he said.
   About 5,000 ``Mission to Mars'' stickers, which show the American
eagle and Soviet bear below the tail of a comet, are to be sold at
an open house in the Mars Middle School Sept. 28, when Runco and
Krikalev are scheduled to appear to together.
   ``Things are happening almost by the hour. I've ordered another
1,000 stickers,'' Terrell said.
   Martians already have purchased about 1,300 lapel pins with the
American and Soviet flags, an item Mrs. Solino said ``has taken off
tremendously.''
   Terrell said the Mars History and Landmarks Society plans to
place a 10-foot steel flying saucer in a downtown lot before a
Wednesday photo session. The makeshift spaceship is being built out
of drum lids, he said.
   Organizers plan to treat the cosmonaut to a Pittsburgh Pirates
baseball game on Tuesday night and a Mars Area High School football
game next Saturday. Runco can stay only two days.
   Terrell said there are no plans for side trips to nearby Moon or
Apollo townships.

   Thousands of caliche pits like the one in
Thursday's fatal school bus accident line roads throughout south
Texas, a little-regulated legacy of contractors who dig up the
gravel-like material for road base and then move on.
   Nineteen students were killed when the bus plunged into the pit
following a collision with a soft-drink delivery truck. The bus
became submerged in about 12 feet of water at the bottom of the
40-foot-deep chasm.
   No guard rail separated the pit from the roadway 20 feet away and
no road signs warned of its presence. Texas Department of Public
Safety Sgt. Israel Pacheco said there was no fence around the pit,
though there may have been one before some recent road construction
nearby.
   There are no state regulations governing the pits, said officials
of the state Railroad Commission, which governs surface mining, and
the General Land Office, which oversees the state's geology.
   Federal mining regulations govern caliche pits while they are
being mined, said Bill Driscoll, executive director of a state
contractors' association, but those regulations do not apply to
inactive pits.
   Officials were unsure who had excavated the pit involved in
Thursday's accident just outside Alton or who owned the land on
which it is located.
   Caliche, a Spanish word, is defined as gravel, sand and desert
debris cemented by a porous calcium carbonate, according to state
geologist Bill Farr.
   The material occurs naturally through the Southwest and Mexico,
and ``is used quite a lot in making road base material,'' Farr said.
   ``You'll see caliche pits lining the highways all throughout the
Southwest,'' he said.
   Such a pit is ``not unusual in the (Rio Grande) Valley,'' Hidalgo
County Sheriff's Deputy Rene Torres said. ``We see that a lot down
here ... I used to go swimming in them as a kid.''
   Farr said caliche will not withstand transportation long
distances, requiring the material to be mined near where it will be
used.
   Contractors lease the ground from owners of land adjoining a
project, dig out the caliche they need, then move on, he said. All
that remains is ``the hole in the ground that left when the caliche
is removed.''
   ``What they're removing is 99 percent of what they're actually
using, so there is really nothing to fill the pit with, other than
to go dig a hole somewhere else,'' Farr said.

<HEAD>Teachers Warn of Worsening Student Social Ills</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two out of three teachers say they would
recommend their profession to youngsters, but many say they are
struggling with worsening social ills among students, especially
alcohol abuse, a new poll finds.
   The annual survey of teacher opinion by the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co., released Thursday, found the number of teachers in
grades 7-12 concerned about student drinking in their schools
increased from 66 percent in 1985 to 81 percent in the latest survey.
   Drinking was considered a serious problem by 91 percent of high
school teachers polled and 87 percent of rural teachers, according
to the survey, ``Preparing Schools for the 1990s.''
   In the last five years, the proportion of teachers considering
the dropout problem serious at their schools rose from 40 percent to
52 percent.
   And 70 percent of high school teachers regard drug use as a
serious problem at their schools, up from 58 percent in 1985.
   ``American teachers, particularly those in our cities, have sent
an S.O.S. about the severity of the out-of-school problems facing
their students,'' Albert Shanker, president of the American
Federation of Teachers, said in reaction to the poll.
   ``If President Bush and the nation's governors are serious about
making education a national priority, one of the things they will
have to do is listen to the messages from the front lines, to the
problems teachers face every day in the classroom,'' Shanker said.
``And what our teachers are crying out for are solutions to the
severe problems children face, which affect the ability of schools
to do their job: poverty, ill health, drug abuse and troubled
families.''
   The survey, appearing less than a week before President Bush is
to convene an ``education summit'' with the nation's governors, was
conducted by Louis Harris and Associates. It was based on a
telephone survey of a nationally representative sample of 2,000
public school teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade polled
in May and June. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus
three percentage points.
   On the positive side, 81 percent of teachers surveyed said they
still ``love to teach.'' Two-thirds said they would advise a young
person to enter the teaching profession, compared with 45 percent
five years ago.
   Fifty-three percent believe education reform has improved their
schools, compared with 43 percent who expressed that view in a 1984
poll. Only six percent said school reforms have had a negative
impact. The remainder said the effects were neutral.
   But teachers were less enthused about the impact of reform on
themselves: 43 percent said reform has affected teachers positively,
27 percent said they felt neutral, and 29 percent said reform has
had a negative effect on teachers.
   Eighty-six percent said they backed mentor-teacher programs in
which teachers help colleagues improve, and 55 percent supported
career ladder programs which offer teachers the chance to advance to
the level of master teacher for more pay.
   Two-thirds said they strongly backed creation of school-based
leadership committees of principals, teachers and students to
enforce school rules.
   But 64 percent say schools are getting worse at sparing teachers
administrative busy work.
   Teachers are most supportive of reform in schools where
``educators are actively involved in making decisions about teaching
and learning, new ideas flourish and student learning improves,''
said Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
the nation's largest teacher union.
   ``In places where reform simply means more _ more graduation
requirements, more hours in the school day, more paperwork, teachers
are understandably less enthusiastic,'' he said.

   The stealth bomber soared
Thursday within 90 feet of a giant Air Force jet to practice
refueling during its fourth test flight over the desert, a military
spokeswoman said.
   The sinister-looking stealth maneuvered behind and beneath the
Air Force KC-10 refueling tanker, the military version of a DC-10,
to practice for an actual refueling scheduled later, said Capt. Tess
Taft Cowan.
   ``It was a successful flight, with all primary mission objectives
being completed,'' she said.
   The stealth, a black boomerang-shaped flying wing, took off from
the base at about 1 p.m., flew for 2 hours, 53 minutes over the
Mojave Desert, then landed back at Edwards at 3:53 p.m., Cowan said.
   The refueling practice was conducted about one hour into the
flight, she said. The time and date of the next test flight were not
announced.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Federal Claims in 19-State Insurance Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal claims in a lawsuit accusing major
insurance companies of conspiring to manufacture a ``liability
crisis'' and drive up rates have been dismissed by a federal judge.
   U.S. District Judge William Schwarzer's decision was released
Thursday in connection with a lawsuit filed by 19 states in March
1988 against 32 major insurance companies and reinsurers, who
provide insurance for insurance companies.
   California Attorney General John Van De Kamp announced he would
appeal the decision.
   The lawsuit claimed insurance companies in the mid-1980s agreed
to sharply reduce liability coverage for public agencies, businesses
and non-profit organizations and to stop all coverage for
environmental damages caused by pollution.
   The judge, who sits in San Francisco, issued a preliminary
decision in July dismissing the suit on grounds that insurance
companies can act together under federal law without being subject
to most types of antitrust suits.
   The states involved in the suit are: California, New York, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Alabama, Massachusetts, Arizona,
Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Colorado,
Montana, Washington, Alaska, Michigan and Louisiana. Texas filed a
similar suit in its state court that is preceeding to trial
independently of this action.
   The states alleged violations of federal antitrust laws and state
laws in a global conspiracy starting in 1984 that they said included
boycotts, threats, intimidation and other coersive conduct.
   Insurance companies denied the allegations, and said rate
increases resulted from claim losses due in part to broad liability
rules in many states. They also blamed investment income declines.
   Insurers are immune from federal antitrust suits unless they are
shown to have engaged in a boycott, intimidation or coercion.

   As Hurricane Hugo tore through the
Caribbean on a beeline course for Puerto Rico, my sister called from
Tennessee to check how we were doing.
   ``We're taping up the windows and moving all the furniture into
the back rooms,'' I said. ``It's kind of exciting.''
   Within 24 hours, our home on the top floor of an 18-story
beachfront condominium would be wrecked and I was to gain an
understanding of hurricanes I could never acquire from simply
reporting on them.
   By the time I arrived from the AP office after midnight Sunday,
my wife, Mary Jane, had taken our four daughters _ Marcia, 13;
Nancy, 11; Katherine, 3; and Susan, 6 months _ to an apartment on
the 17th floor. Our neighbors there, Herb and Nancy Brown, had put
up aluminum siding on their windows.
   I decided to stay in our apartment, resting on a mattress in the
study on the side away from the sea. I put a clock on a bookcase.
Hugo, with more than 140 mph winds, was supposed to hit sometime
after daybreak.
   The wind was howling, and it started to rain. I kept getting up
to see whether the windows were holding up. Eventually, the
electricity went off. In the dark I stepped in a puddle, water from
a broken window, and moved the mattress into the hall.
   At about 6 a.m., Mary Jane had rapped on the Browns' bedroom door
and asked Herb if it was just her imagination that the bed was
shaking. It wasn't.
   While the children slept, Mary Jane came several times to check
our apartment as water spread across the floors.
   She brought up our dog, Lucky, a small, black mongrel, who had
been whining in a bathroom. It was cool, but Lucky's fur was wet and
she was panting.
   I thought, I can try to fool myself into thinking we're not in
danger, but you can't fool this animal.
   Palms were bending now. Glass was shattering, and metal was
tearing away from the building.
   Mary Jane and the girls had moved into the hall with the Browns
and spread sofa cushions on the floor. I joined them with the
mattress.
   We followed the progress of the storm on the radio and watched
through a concrete lattice in a corner of the hall. Periodically, I
went back upstairs to listen outside my apartment.
   Amazingly, the telephones were still working, and I could get
through to the office. I was talking with Bureau Chief Kernan
Turner, when there was a shatter of glass _ followed by silence.
Finally, he came back on the line after having run for cover at the
back of the office and then crawling back to the phone. Everybody
was OK, but the office was taking a beating.
   By then, our building was swaying like a ship at sea.
   We debated whether a hurricane can topple an 18-floor building.
Are you safer on the top floor or the ground floor? Nobody knew.
   We took up an offer to move the family down to the 11th floor,
where the sway was less noticeable and the wind less fierce.
   We settled outside an apartment occupied by two sisters we had
never met, Teresa and Lucy Bague. They gave our children water,
juice, crackers and Milky Way bars. Susan, the baby, was the only
one who slept much.
   Mary Jane told me later, ``I looked at you and your lips were
gray. I thought, mine must be, too.''
   Hours passed. The storm died down and then came back stronger
than ever, as if roused from fitful sleep.
   Then the hurricane hit us with all its might. Two hours later
Hugo passed and we were safe.

<TEXT>
   A Texas judge picked by President Bush to head
the Office of Government Ethics has been ruled out after an FBI
background check found ``disqualifying'' information, according to a
report published Friday.
   Paul Pressler of Houston had not yet been formally nominated for
the post, but the routine background check was being conducted in
preparation for that, The Washington Post reported.
   ``Information was uncovered we felt was disqualifying,'' an
official, whose identity was not disclosed, told the newspaper.
   Anonymous officials cited by the Post would not give details of
the contents of the FBI report, except to say that it did not
contain allegations of crimes or financial improprieties.
   The Post identified Pressler as a civil court judge and a leader
of a fundamentalist movement within the Southern Baptist Convention.
   Pressler, reached by telephone in San Francisco by The Associated
Press, said no one at the White House had contacted him about the
information in the FBI report or to say that he had been
disqualified for the ethics post.
   ``I have no idea about it,'' Pressler said. When asked if the
administration had picked him for the ethics job, he replied, ``I'm
not sure, we talked a little about it.''
   A White House official told the newspaper there is not yet
another leading candidate for the job.
   The ethics office is responsible for application of ethics laws
and regulations in the government, including review of personal
financial statements of federal officials.
   In his presidential campaign last year, Bush pledged to make
ethics in government a priority.

   Republican senators, following six hours of
negotiations with Democrats, agreed late Thursday to take a new plan
for financing the war on drugs to the White House for consideration.
   Sources said the plan contained some of the selected cuts in
spending the Bush administration had wanted as a way to offset
increases in the drug program as well as an across-the-board
reduction in federal programs to raise the bulk of the money.
   Republicans said they would not consider the plan a tentative
agreement without White House approval and they indicated that there
was no rush on the part of the Bush administration to provide that.
   ``We've been on the phone to (White House chief of staff John)
Sununu all night,'' Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said emerging from the
negotiations along with other tired senators.
   Republicans said they would take the plan to the White House on
Friday and then reconvene their negotiations with the Democrats.
   Senators declined to comment on specifics of the plan. Sources
who spoke on condition of anonymity said, however, that the
across-the-board cut envisioned in the proposal would amount to 0.3
percent. That would be an increase from a 0.2875 percent reduction
in a plan that Republicans carried into the negotiating session
Thursday afternoon.
   That Republican plan would have paid for all but $23 million of
an $850 million increase in the drug war on top of the $7.9 billion
proposed by Bush.
   Offsets in selected programs under the new versions would be
determined at the committee level. Democrats are planning something
similar to that but on a larger scale in the House.
   Approval of the proposal would stave off a threatened blockade of
spending bills on the Senate floor with nine days to go before the
start of the next fiscal year when they will be needed to pay for
the operations of the government.
   Four spending bills are currently awaiting passage in the Senate
and eight others are in the pipeline.

   Releasing Nelson Mandela from a South
African prison would mean little if the system that keeps blacks
second-class citizens is allowed to stand, his daughter says.
   ``In many ways, he'll still be a prisoner under that system,''
Maki Mandela said Wednesday during a visit to Memphis State
University.
   Mandela, 70, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence on conspiracy and sabotage charges.
   He has become a symbol of black South Africa's struggle to
abolish apartheid, and human rights activists around the world have
called for his release.
   Ms. Mandela, who was 8 years old when her father first went to
prison, said she was allowed a private visit with him last month.
   ``For the first time, we could visit more than 45 minutes without
the police being there,'' she said. ``It was just a nice,
fatherly-daughter exchange.''

   Sammy Davis Jr. says his wife, Altovise, and
Barbara Sinatra helped him kick drugs by enlisting the aid of his
Rat Pack buddy, Frank Sinatra.
   ``Because of her love, I had a second chance,'' he said of his
wife. ``Because of her, I've found my friendships have grown deeper
and more substantial.''
   Davis, who was diagnosed last week with throat cancer, says he
was driven to drugs by ``a terrible insecurity'' but stopped using
them after meeting with Sinatra.
   ``He was telling me and looking right at me with his steely
blues, man, looking me right in the eye. He said, `Stop it! ... So
long as you're going to do that, I don't want to be around you,'''
Davis says in this Sunday's Parade magazine.
   ``And I said, `Frank, I'll stop, I promise.' That was nine years
ago.''

   ``In the early days it was more of a free-form magazine. There
was much less journalism than there is today,'' he said.

   ``The Man Who Shot Lincoln'' comes to the
audience from limbo, something like a live, weird episode of ``The
Twilight Zone.''
   The play, not without interest but finally less than successful,
opened Thursday night at the off-Broadway Astor Place Theater. In
it, actor Edwin Booth tells us his version of his life story, in
which he and not his brother John Wilkes shoots Abraham Lincoln at
Ford's Theater.
   It's essentially a tale in which Edwin Booth plays both Othello,
overwhelmingly jealous of his wife, and Iago, whispering accusations
into his own ear.
   The conversation starts out stilted, and Sam Tsoutsouvas speaks
it with ripe plumminess and a smirk, to the discomfort of listeners.
Both dialogue and delivery improve, but not enough.
   A feeling of restlessness develops as the play progresses, though
one doesn't entirely lose interest.
   The characters include Booth's wife Mary, played with saintly
sweetness by Marcia Gay Harden. Mary dies soon after giving birth
but remains in the play as a figment of Booth's imagination.
   Conan McCarty is sprightly as a jaunty, womanizing John Wilkes
Booth, passionate defender of the Confederacy. Eric Tull shows
versatility in walk-ons as the Booth brothers' insane father, a
simpleton, and a Union officer.
   Playwright Luigi Creatore has had musicals and at least one other
drama produced. Crandall Diehl directed. Michael Bottari and Ronald
Case designed scenery and period costumes. William de Silva produced
in association with Claridge Productions Inc.

   Two soldiers with
submachine guns waved their arms and shouted, ordering a woman and
her three teen-age children to slap paint on a white stone wall to
cover anti-Israeli graffiti.
   Down the street, Israeli tax agents dragged furniture from a home
in lieu of unpaid taxes.
   In nearby Beit Jala, troops searched house to house for a
stone-thrower who injured an Israeli soldier.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, shops in Gaza City were shut for a
second day to protest the killing of a 21-year-old man by soldiers.
   Thursday was one more day in the intefadeh, the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
that has sometimes raged and sometimes sputtered for more than 21
months.
   It is the deaths that make headlines. But the uprising is made up
of thousands of tiny incidents: stones thrown at soldiers,
checkpoints thrown up by troops, tax or arrest raids, outlawed
Palestinian flags flown from telephone wires.
   According to the army, more than 33,000 instances of stone
throwing and tire burning occurred in the past year. That doesn't
include 756 firebombings, 130 knifings or other serious assaults, or
345 cases of arson.
   ``These numbers show the uprising is still going on,'' says a
military officer, who agreed to discuss the revolt on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The intensity is not what it once was, it's lost a lot of its
volume,'' he said, but he added that violence may flare at any
moment.
   ``You have ups and downs. It can be affected by rumors, by
factors even outside the country, not just what the army does or
people in the community do.''
   The officer said the army did everything it could to prevent more
violence when it made raids to arrest uprising activists. But he
added: ``Obviously there's an animosity to army presence.''
   An uprising leader, asked about the status of the intefadeh,
noted: ``The youngsters throw stones, of course. That's no secret.
And we have our daily battles with the settlers.''
   The man, an organizer for the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said Jewish settlers often fire at
stone-throwing youngsters or smashed Arab-owned cars in revenge.
   When asked what caused bigger demonstrations, he said: ``It's the
street. It's not just dozens of youngsters. The street, the people,
are ready to cooperate, sometimes the anger bursts and it happens.''
   The street did not explode Thursday, but the intefadeh went on.
   Seven youths were reported shot by soldiers in clashes with
stone-throwers in the Gaza Strip. One confrontation was in the
Jabaliya refugee camp, where the uprising started on Dec. 8, 1987.
   Since then, 573 Palestinians have been killed by soldiers or
Jewish civilians, and 40 Israelis have been slain. At least 114
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as alleged
collaborators.
   Stores were shut in Gaza City on Thursday to mark the death of
Omar Ahmed Mansour, who threw a firebomb at an Israeli patrol on
Tuesday.
   In Beit Jala, in the West Bank, the army ordered all residents to
stay off the streets while soldiers searched houses for suspects in
the stoning of a soldier a day earlier.
   A parked Israeli tourist bus was firebombed in Manger Square in
Bethlehem, near where Jesus is believed to have been born. The bus
was gutted, but no one was hurt. Soldiers closed off the square and
Arab reports said 50 youths were rounded up for questioning.
   In neighboring Beit Sahour, a stronghold of the uprising's
boycott of Israeli taxes, soldiers escorted revenue agents who were
seizing truckloads of property from homes and businesses to demand
payment for taxes.
   Other soldiers ordered anti-Israeli graffiti painted over,
pulling people out of houses to do the work. But the streets here
and throughout the West Bank are testimony that the army cannot win
its battle against graffiti.
   Slogans painted over dozens of times reappear in bright colors.
One slogan on a Beit Sahour garbage bin said: ``Shamir's office,''
referring to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Another said:
``Anybody who pays taxes will be punished.''
   At a small grocery, friends of Kamal Tawfik Abu Saada, 40,
consoled him over the loss of a refrigerator display case hauled off
by tax raiders. Abu Saada said the unit had cost him about $5,000.
   He admitted he refused to pay taxes. ``It only goes to the army.
I will never pay. It's impossible.''
   Raji, 55, who refused to give his last name, said soldiers and
tax men took carpets, his furniture, a video and television set from
his house. He chuckled over the framed map of Palestine the tax men
ignored.
   ``They only wanted the furniture,'' he said. ``They want to
punish Beit Sahour.''

   A USAir pilot told the control tower he was
aborting takeoff moments before his jetliner slid into the East
River, killing two passengers, but did not say what the problem was,
officials said Thursday.
   ``There was no indication of why he was aborting,'' said Federal
Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar. ``Until we know why
the guy aborted the takeoff, we have no way of knowing the cause of
the accident.''
   Survivors clung to the wings of the broken aircraft or grasped
floating timbers after the Boeing 737-400 slid into Bowery Bay off
LaGuardia Airport at 11:29 p.m. Wednesday. Two women were killed,
but 59 people including crew members survived.
   The jet's flight data and cockpit voice recorders were analyzed
Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board, but provided
no immediate clues on the cause of the crash, said NTSB Chairman
James Kolstad said.
   ``There were no noises or voices that suggested there was any
problem with the takeoff or why the takeoff was aborted,'' Kolstand
said at an evening news conference at Kennedy Airport.
   The flight data box recording indicated that the plane swerved
slightly instead of moving straight down the runway and showed some
``deviations'' in rudder movement, Kolstad said, but investigators
did not immediately understand what effect that might have had on
the takeoff.
   Meanwhile, the New York Times in its Friday editions said law
enforcement officials were checking reports that the co-pilot told
Port Authority police shortly after the crash that the pilot had
been ``mumbling'' and ``acting irrationally'' just before takeoff.
   However, Port Authority spokesman John Hughes said PA police had
no interviews with the crew after the crash. Commenting on the Times
report, Hughes said, ``I have heard nothing about that.
   The paper, quoting undentified airline industry officials, said
the pilot and co-pilot had little experience aboard 737s. The pilot
had flown the planes for only two months and the co-pilot was said
to have been in a 737 cockpit crew for the first time, the newspaper
said.
   A tape-recorded message answered USAir's public relations office
telephone and referred all questions to the NTSB.
   A spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board,
Rachel Halterman, said the NTSB had ``no direct knowledge'' of the
Times report. She said until the pilots are interviewed, ``anything
else is hearsay.''
   The crew has not been interviewed yet by authorities and Kolstad
had no information about their experience or identities.
   He said the NTSB had asked for drug and alcohol tests for the
crew and plans to interview the pilot and co-pilot Friday. They have
the right to decline to speak with investigators but can be
subpoenaed if they refuse, said NTSB spokeswoman Rachel Halterman.
   USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny declined to discuss any details or
possible causes of the crash, saying the NTSB had jurisdiction.
   ``The captain is taking advice of his own counsel,'' Colodny said
at a news conference. He declined to identify the pilot or other
crew members or describe their experience, other than to say they
had been based in Baltimore and had worked for Piedmont Aviation
before its merger with USAir in August.
   Flight 5050, bound for Charlotte, N.C., was accelerating down the
runway in a light rain when the control tower acknowledged the
pilot's request to abort and cleared him to turn onto the last
taxiway before the end of the runway.
   Farrar said a pilot would not be required to get permission to
abort takeoff. He said it was not immediately clear exactly at what
point the communication with the tower occurred or which member of
the flight crew was at the radio but it likely was whichever pilot
was not controlling the plane at the time.
   ``The pilot seemed to be accelerating but didn't have enough
power to get the plane up,'' said passenger Larry Martin. ``He put
on the brakes. The plane took a dip and the next thing I knew all
hell broke loose.''
   The plane broke into three parts about 50 to 100 feet into Bowery
Bay, its front sections resting above the water on a trestle that
held runway lights, its back sections submerged. The two women who
died were seated in the rear.
   ``People were on top of each other. People were screaming,'' said
Martin, who was traveling with his wife, Valerie. ``There was the
smell of gas. Everyone was saying `Get out! Get out! Get out!' ''
   Stunned passengers scramled out doors and onto wings. Some
escaped down an emergency chute and found themselves in about 25
feet of water. Many clung to wings or grasped floating timbers.
   ``I said, hell, this thing is going to blow up,'' said passenger
Fred O'Loughlin. ``Then all of a sudden I was in the water by
myself.''
   ``The crew was great. ... They were pitching people out and down
the slide,'' said passenger Tom Newberry, 27. ``We just grabbed on
to a big piece of wood and held on for dear life.''
   Police scuba divers freed as many as 15 people who were trapped
in the cabin, while rescuers in boats scooped passengers from the
water or off the wings. ``They were hanging from the pier, hanging
on the wing, hanging from the front of the plane,'' said police Lt.
Larry Johnston.
   Rescuers, working under the glare of emergency lights, placed
slings under the tail section to keep it from sinking and had all
survivors ashore within 40 minutes.
   Authorities did not identify the women who died, but a relative
said they were Betsy Hayter Brogan, in her 30s, of Gray, Tenn., and
her mother-in-law, Alice Brogan of Roanoke, Va. The relative, Jack
Hayter of Morristown, Tenn., said the younger woman was a nurse who
had a 5-year-old son.
   There were 55 passengers and six crew members on the plane,
Colodny said. Forty-five people went to hospitals, and USAir Vice
President Jack Long said eight remained hospitalized. One was hurt
seriously and had undergone surgery for ``blunt trauma.''
   Flight 5050 was added to the schedule after an earlier flight was
canceled because of bad weather, airline spokeswoman Susan Young
said. It was raining lightly at the time of the crash, but Bill
Cahill, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,
which operates the airport, said weather was not a factor.
   The plane was 9 months old and it had no history of mechanical
problems, said airline spokeswoman Nancy Vaughan. A three-member
Boeing crash team planned to examine the aircraft.
   A 737-400 operated by British Midland Airways crashed Jan. 8
north of London, killing 44 people. Investigators said the crash may
have resulted from a fire in one engine and the crew mistakenly
shutting down the other engine, but no official report has been
issued.
   Many uninjured survivors huddled in blankets at a terminal
building. Others spoke from hospital beds.
   Joseph Pankow, a North Carolina businessman, recalled trying to
reassure a woman who was screaming in panic after the plane came to
rest. ``I said, `Calm down, you're going to make it, we're all going
to make it. Let's pray together and let's get out of this airplane.'
   ``A lady was next to me with a small baby, and I've been around
just 40 years, but that baby's been around not even 40 months,'' he
said. ``So, for that baby to live and be safe tonight is a dream for
me,'' Pankow said. ``And I only pray that the families that have
suffered the losses of their cherished folks, that they're OK and
they try to understand.''

<HEAD>PLO Leader Tells Israel to Leave Territories, Talk Peace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat appealed to Israel
to join him in peace talks and said his group had not taken a
position on an Egyptian proposal.
   In freewheeling banter with local and foreign reporters at a
Cairo news conference Thursday, Arafat called the Israelis his
``cousins'' and said Israel's crackdown on the Palestinian uprising
violates Jewish religious teaching.
   Arafat asked the Israeli press to convey to their leaders and
people his ``invitation'' to withdraw from the occupied territories,
then join him in a dialogue and a peace treaty.
   ``I want you to carry this invitation to all Israeli people and
to all Israeli officials, and I want to have an answer and a
response to what I said,'' he told the journalists.
   The Israelis refuse to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which they denounce as a terrorist group.
   Arafat arrived in Egypt earlier Thursday to meet with President
Hosni Mubarak on the Egyptian leader's 10 suggested changes in an
Israeli plan.
   The Israeli plan calls for Palestinian elections leading to
negotiations between Israel and representatives of the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip on limited autonomy.
   In an effort to overcome Arab objections, Mubarak has proposed
basing negotiations on the land-for-peace principle and letting the
140,000 Arabs in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem vote in the
Palestinian elections.
   However, he has not demanded an explicit PLO role in representing
the territories and has not called for the creation of a Palestinian
state.
   Arafat said the PLO had not taken a position on Mubarak's
suggestions.
   ``All these subjects are still under discussion, and there is an
effort by Mubarak and by other friends to reach an overall solution
to all these questions,'' Arafat said.
   In recent days, Mubarak has been trying to sell Israelis on his
proposals through a media blitz. In radio and newspaper interviews,
he has appealed to Israeli citizens to challenge their government's
refusal to negotiate with the PLO.
   In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud
bloc told high school students in Tel Aviv he thought the Egyptian
leader was ``only kidding around'' by his appeals.
   ``I think that our people rely on the government,'' Shamir said.
``We are a democratic country. If the people didn't rely on the
government, it wouldn't stand. It's not like in Egypt.''
   However, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the left-of-center
Labor Party praised Mubarak's efforts and rejected right-wing
criticism of Mubarak's appeals.
   Labor, which is Likud's governing coalition partner, has endorsed
Mubarak's plan. Rabin said Thursday, ``We are prepared for a
dialogue with a Palestinian delegation that is arranged by Egypt
with our agreement.''
   Arafat remained cool and jovial when addressing Israeli
reporters, but he showed anger in talking about the Israeli army's
crackdown on the Palestinian uprising.
   ``The main question is the daily killing of our children, our
women, our men. Isn't this wrong?'' he asked. ``These are our
children. Is this the teaching of the Torah? You are violating the
Torah,'' he said, referring to the Jewish religious scriptures.
   He claimed the Israelis have killed 932 Palestinians since the
uprising began in December 1987.
   Associated Press records, which are based on U.N., Israeli and
Arab sources, indicate 573 Palestinian have died.

   Federal health officials say they hope to reduce
infant mortality and obesity in the 1990s, but they acknowledge that
many goals of the past 10 years have not been met.
   The Public Health Service, which on Thursday listed 21 areas for
improvement by the year 2000, said other goals for the upcoming
decade are a longer life expectancy and fewer adult smokers.
   ``We ought to be able to anticipate progress in each of them,''
said Dr. J. Michael McGinnis, director of the Office of Disease
Prevention and Health Promototion in Washington.
   ``The biggest challenge will be in the area of violent and
abusive behavior,'' McGinnis said.
   McGinnis said only modest progress was made in many of the health
goals set to be reached by 1990. But he said he had optimism for the
'90s.
   ``We know more now about what the risk groups are,'' McGinnis
said.
   He said, for example, that little improvement has occurred during
the 1980s in controlling Americans' obesity.
   Other areas where goals for the current decade apparently will
not be reached are immunization of children before age 2 and flu
vaccinations for high-risk populations, the Atlanta-based national
Centers for Disease Control said in its weekly report. The report
referred to a draft of the PHS' ``Year 2000 Objectives for the
Nation.''
   McGinnis said infant mortality is an area where ``progress has
been reasonably good, but we need to target areas where the
population is most vulnerable. We have not been able to close the
gap between blacks and whites and have missed the target for 1990 of
reducing the rate for blacks.''
   In a telephone interview, McGinnis said that among the tentative
targets for 2000 were cutting the percentage of adult smokers in
half, to about 15 percent, and reducing infant mortality from 10.4
per thousand in 1986 to no more than seven per thousand.
   Other goals, he said, include raising life expectancy to at least
78 years from 74.9, and increasing years of healthy life to 65 years
from an estimated 60 in 1987.
   ``Smoking is a good example,'' said McGinnis, a deputy assistant
secretary for health. ``It's accountable for 390,000 deaths a year.
It's an example of where we can target low-income and minority
populations, where the most difficult challenges lie.''
   The 21 areas targeted by the PHS for improvement by the year 2000
include: nutrition; physical activity and fitness; tobacco, alcohol
and other drugs; sexual behavior; violent and abusive behavior;
vitality and independence of older people; environmental health;
occupational safety and health; and unintentional injuries.
   Others are maternal and infant health; immunization and
infectious diseases; AIDS; other sexually transmitted diseases;
cholesterol and high blood pressure; cancer; other chronic
disorders; oral health; mental and behavioral disorders; health
education and preventive services; and surveillance and data systems.
   McGinnis said the planning process was not complete and that
comment was welcome.

<TEXT>
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp plans to create a new
job of chief financial officer for the department as part of a
response to apparent mismanagement and what Kemp says is a ``rip-off
of the poor.''
   Claire E. Freeman, HUD's assistant secretary-designate for
administration, told a congressional panel Thursday that plans were
being drafted for a job with broad responsibility for monitoring the
Department of Housing and Urban Development's spending.
   ``If any agency needs one, it certainly is HUD,'' Freeman said.
``That will be a critical position at HUD.''
   Kemp, who has acknowledged up to $2 billion may have been
misspent at the department under the Reagan administration, called
the HUD problems ``the rip-off of the poor in the housing programs''
in an appearance before another Senate committee.
   Freeman spoke at her confirmation hearing by the Senate Committee
on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. She has been serving in an
acting capacity for several months.
   A spokesman for HUD, Jack Flynn, said the new position has not
yet been formally announced and may be included in a package of
departmental reforms Kemp plans to announce in October.
   He said details and responsibilities are still being worked out,
but the new position would have broader authority than the current
department budget director.
   HUD has been enmeshed in scandal over allegations of influence
peddling, fraud and mismanagement stemming from the eight years in
which the department was headed by Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   Pierce is under subpoena by a House subcommittee to testify next
Tuesday, and at least two more times, as part of the congressional
investigation into the department's problems.
   Stuart Weisberg, staff director of the House panel investigating
HUD, said the subpoenas were formally served with Pierce's attorneys
late Thursday.
   Kemp, appearing before the Senate Small Business Committee,
touched on the HUD scandals only briefly as he urged support for the
administration's proposed tax incentives for urban and rural
enterprise zones.
   He criticized the House Ways and Means Committee for failing to
approve the enterprise zone tax breaks while backing a series of
larger tax breaks for specific industries.
   ``It would be unconscionable to ignore our nation's poor, while
providing assistance to business, energy and prosperous Americans,''
he said.
   The administration's proposal would eliminate capital gains taxes
for assets within areas designated as enterprise zones. It would
also permit tax deductions of up to $250,000 for new investments,
and provide a 5 percent refundable tax credit of up to $525 for
low-income workers within the zones. The administration estimates
the cost at $50 million in fiscal 1990.

<HEAD>Audit Finds Loan Program For Vets Suffering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal program that guarantees housing
loans to veterans faces further financial erosion from loan
foreclosures and will require more taxpayer subsidies, according to
an audit by the investigative arm of Congress.
   The General Accounting Office said the Veterans' Affairs
Department program once largely paid its way, but needed $900
million in appropriations and transfers from other programs last
year.
   The audit, which was released earlier this week, blamed the
program's problems on the high rate of defaults in depressed farm
and oil-producing areas, but it also cited problems in how the
program has been run.
   Efforts are under way in Congress to pass legislation correcting
some of the problems in the special loan program, which has
benefited about 13 million veterans, the GAO said.
   There were 43,693 foreclosures on homes financed with VA loans in
the 1987 fiscal year and 48,963 foreclosures in fiscal 1988, the
report said. There were 38,721 in the first 10 months of this fiscal
year, VA spokeswoman Donna St. John said.
   ``We expect the numbers to continue to decrease,'' she said.
   The department says it is spending $778 million on the program
this fiscal year, with $120 million of that in supplemental funds.
   The GAO says the government will have to give an extra $453
million to the program in fiscal 1990 to pay off bad loans, and will
have to transfer about $100 million from a separate program used for
direct mortgage loans to severely disabled veterans.
   But several factors could drive the need for additional money
even higher, the audit said, including a foreclosure rate that is
higher than what the department projects.

   A judge's ruling in a divorce custody
battle over seven frozen human embryos that life begins at
conception has inflamed the debate on when life starts.
   Abortion foes took heart at the Tennessee ruling Thursday that
custody of the embryos could be awarded as if they were children.
   Regina Smith, executive director of the Pro-Life Council of
Connecticut, called the court's decision ``a victory for unborn
children.''
   ``This ruling reflects what pro-lifers have been saying for years
_ that life begins at conception and should be protected by the laws
of our land,'' Ms. Smith said.
   But those who support a woman's right to have an abortion called
the decision wrong-headed and found it at odds with the U.S. Supreme
Court decision in Roe vs. Wade that legalized abortion.
   ``That may be the personal view of this particular judge, but it
has no basis in law,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of
the National Abortion Rights Action League in Washington. ``It also
has dangerous implications for reproductive freedom in America.''
   Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young awarded temporary
custody of the embryos to Mary Sue Davis, who wants them implanted
in her so she can bear a child. The judge rejected the arguments of
her estranged husband, Junior Lewis Davis, who sued for divorce and
sought an order preventing implantation.
   Child support, visitation and final custody will be decided if a
birth results, the judge wrote.
   Davis, 31, vowed to appeal to the Tennessee Court of Appeals.
   ``They are going to force me to become a father against my
wishes,'' he said.
   Mrs. Davis, 29, who now lives near Titusville, Fla., said she
would wait to try to get pregnant until appeals were over. She said
the earliest she would try would be in January.
   Charles Clifford, the husband's attorney, said he believed this
was the first time a judge declared an embryo a human being. He said
the ruling conflicts with the Roe vs. Wade decision, which said that
a fetus in the early stages of development lacks legal rights.
   The Roe decision ``contains some explicit language that says that
a fetus, which of course is much further along than an embryo, is
not a human being for the purposes of the United States
Constitution,'' Clifford said.
   The judge said he believed Roe vs. Wade didn't apply to the Davis
case because it dealt with the constitutionality of abortion, not
conception.
   ``From fertilization, the cells of a human embryo are
differentiated, unique and specialized to the highest degree of
distinction,'' the judge said. Thus, he said, ``Human life begins at
conception.''
   Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the Tennessee American Civil
Liberties Union, said there is no consensus among doctors and
scientists supporting the judge's conclusion.
   ``There is no question that while some people believe that life
begins at conception, that is based on religious belief,'' Weinberg
said.
   The case grew out of the decade-old technology of ``test-tube
babies,'' or in-vitro fertilization. Eggs extracted surgically from
a woman are fertilized in a laboratory dish and then can be
implanted back in the woman.
   The couple produced nine embryos in December with the help of Dr.
I. Ray King at a Knoxville clinic. Two were implanted in Mrs. Davis
but failed to develop. The others were put in cold storage. Davis
sued for divorce in February.
   After declaring the four- to eight-cell embryos to be children
rather than property, Young in effect treated the case like a
typical custody dispute, in which the overriding concern is the best
interest of the child.
   The Davises' divorce is not yet final. In his ruling, Young
instructed Mrs. Davis' attorney to file final papers that would
complete the proceeding. Other issues, like the division of
household property, were uncontested.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Limiting Protection to S&amp;L Buyers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is limiting the
protection it's willing to give buyers of insolvent savings
institutions, a marked shift from a much-criticized government
policy in 1988 thrift bailouts.
   The overseers of the Resolution Trust Corp., an agency created
last month to deal with failed S&amp;Ls, on Thursday barred regulators
from guaranteeing S&amp;L buyers against losses for longer than six
months.
   An attorney who has represented buyers of failed thrifts said the
decision will leave the government holding more of the sour loans
and real estate from insolvent institutions, but will make it easier
to sell the S&amp;Ls.
   ``There aren't many acquirers that are going to be willing to
take asset risks,'' said Thomas P. Vartanian, a Washington lawyer.
   As a result, the government will end up holding the assets and
trying to sell them separately from the institutions. That, in turn,
could make the ``clean'' institutions more attractive to buyers.
   Christie Sciacca of The Secura Group, a consulting firm advising
S&amp;L buyers, said purchasers, if they accept the bad assets, likely
will demand more government assistance in exchange for giving up
long-term loss protection.
   ``It's kind of `pay me now or pay me later' from the buyer's
standpoint,'' he said.
   Previously, the government effectively warehoused the bad loans
and real estate within bailed-out institutions by guaranteeing the
new owners against loss, sometimes as long as 10 years.
   But critics in Congress said the deals left the government and
taxpayers open to potentially huge and unknowable losses if bad
loans continued to deteriorate or real estate prices fell.
   Nevertheless, a three-member oversight board headed by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady voted at its first public meeting to bar
long-term guarantees in future rescues.
   The short-term guarantees it envisions would allow the government
to complete bailout deals swiftly by giving buyers the right to sell
back loans and other assets they had not had a chance to fully
evaluate. But, buyers would retain that right no longer than six
months and there would be no long-term risk assumed by the
government.
   The oversight panel, which includes Housing Secretary Jack Kemp
and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, also told
regulators to avoid taking large ownership positions in bailed-out
S&amp;Ls, thus exposing the government to the risk of future losses.
   In some past deals, the government has remained as a principal
owner of bailed-out banks and thrifts, a practice that has allowed
it to entice reluctant purchasers into putting at least some private
money into ailing institutions.
   However, under the new policy, regulators will be allowed to
retain warrants that entitle the government to share in unexpected
windfall profits earned by rescued S&amp;Ls.
   The oversight board sets the policies for the RTC. However, its
work is carried out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
insures bank and S&amp;L deposits.
   That arrangement, designed to ensure a strong administration
voice in the spending of the $50 billion in S&amp;L rescue money through
1991, has caused some tension between the Treasury-dominated
oversight panel and the FDIC, an independent agency.
   At one point, regulators complained they were ready to proceed
with large rescue deals, but could not because the oversight board
had not set the necessary policies.
   David C. Cooke, the RTC chief executive, said Thursday's action
``gives us the flexibility to do any kind of deal that we foresee
right now.''
   So far, the RTC has resolved the cases of 18 small institutions,
with $1.1 billion in deposits, but still has 257 institutions in its
care. Cooke said it hopes to complete five large deals by the end of
this month, spending a total of $8 billion, including the
transactions in August and earlier this month.

<HEAD>Crop Yields Expected to Keep Far Ahead of Needs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The problem of over-production in U.S.
agriculture will be around for at least another 40 years, says a new
study by the Agriculture Department.
   Rising crop yields are expected to increase more than enough to
offset U.S. population growth and export demands. That will result
in 40 percent less farmland needed for such major crops as wheat,
corn and soybeans.
   The new projections were included Thursday in a 280-page
appraisal of the nation's soil and water resources ordered by
Congress in the Resource Conservation Act of 1977.
   In its first RCA appraisal published in 1981 and using
information from the 1970s, USDA analysts said almost 390 million
acres would be required by 2030. By comparison, slightly more than
380 million acres were used for crops in 1982, the base year for the
new projections.
   Under ``intermediate'' conditions assumed in the latest study,
cropland acreage in 2030 is projected to be slightly less than 220
million acres.
   ``The differences in the two projections of acreages needed do
not result primarily from differences in projected demand (for
commodities),'' the report said.
   ``In fact,'' it continued, ``for the major crops _ corn, sorghum,
soybeans and wheat _ projections of quantities needed are higher in
the second appraisal than in the first, largely because projected
export demands are higher.''
   The report said domestic use of some grains in 2030 may be lower
than previously anticipated because of improvements in livestock
feeding efficiency and much greater use of pasture and forage. Also,
per capita projections of red meat consumption are lower in the new
appraisal.
   But the main reason for the differences in the amount of cropland
that will be required in 2030 stems from the projected rates of crop
yields.
   For example, in the first appraisal, average U.S. corn yields in
2030 were projected at 144 bushels per acre. The 1989 harvest is
currently estimated at 112.4 bushels per acre.
   The new appraisal puts 2030 corn yields at 198 bushels per acre.
Sorghum would go to 127 bushels per acre, compared with 67 projected
in the first appraisal and this year's average of 62.6 bushels.
   Wheat would go to 70 bushels per acre from 42 projected earlier
and this year's average of 32.9. Soybean yields were projected at 69
bushels per acre, compared with 45 earlier and 32 this year.
   ``The assumptions about yield increases mirror the vastly changed
view of the future that has developed during the past decade,'' the
report said. ``In the early 1970s, many studies indicated
productivity was increasing more slowly than in preceding decades.''
   At that time it appeared to researchers that ``without
significant technological breakthroughs and increased investment in
research and extension programs, the rate of growth in productivity
will probably continue to decline.''
   But later research ``provided a basis for greater optimism,'' the
report said. In scientific meetings in 1982 and in 1986, a view
developed favorable to continued technological progress in crop and
livestock production as well as in conservation of the nation's
resources.
   As in the first RCA appraisal, the second found major problems
confronting U.S. soil and water resources: erosion, salinization,
range deterioration, pollution, destruction of wetlands and wildlife
habitat and acid rain.
   Further, about 1.5 million acres of agricultural land are being
``irreversibly removed'' from production and converted to
non-agricultural uses each year, the report said.
   If the loss rate continues, the nation's cropland base would be
reduced buy nearly 48 million acres, or 12 percent, between 1982 and
2030, the period covered by the new appraisal.

   President Bush met with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze on Thursday, opening three days of high-level
talks expected to narrow a time frame for a superpower summit next
year and spur chemical and nuclear weapons cutbacks.
   After nearly two hours of discussions, Shevardnadze said the two
sides had not set a date for a summit meeting between Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev but, ``We have concluded that
a summit is necessary. There is no doubt about that.''
   Bush, interviewed Thursday night on ABC-TV's ``Primetime Live''
show, said there will be a summit, but he did not specify a time.
When asked if it would be early next year, the president replied,
``I wouldn't say early.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III indicated a summit meeting
might not occur until next year, but said it would be in the United
States. Another U.S. official, speaking privately, said, ``I would
steer you away from this year, definitely.''
   The high-level meetings began with a White House session attended
by Bush, Shevardnadze and Baker. The discussions will continue
between Baker and Shevardnadze on Friday and Saturday at a
wilderness lodge near Jackson Hole, Wyo. The two arrived there late
Thursday on an Air Force jet, where Shevardnadze said he hoped ``the
the good fresh air of Wyoming will help'' bring fresh ideas.
   Discussion aboard the plane concentrated on independence
movements among the Soviet Union's Baltic republics and Gorbachev's
plans to restructure the nation's economy.
   ``In the past, the Soviet preoccupation was never to reveal a
weakness because they felt we would exploit it,'' said the U.S.
official who spoke to five reporters aboard the plane on the
condition he would not be identified. ``Now they understand we are
interested in a relationship of mutual advantge.''
   Baker said that there was ``a full discussion of a summit'' and
that ``we hope to have a general time frame fora summit which we
could announce while we're in Wyoming.''
   Shevardnadze spoke with reporters in the White House driveway
before getting into a waiting limousine. Using the same language as
Baker, Shevardnadze said the talks in Wyoming probably would set ``a
general time frame'' for a Bush-Gorbachev summit. The foreign
minister said, ``I think it is entirely possible that we'll have
something more definite for you in Wyoming.''
   Bush said Monday he felt he was ``under no rush'' to have a
summit.
   While saying the timing and site for a summit have not been
determined, Baker said, ``I think it's our turn'' to host such a
meeting. The last superpower summit was in Moscow in 1988.
   ``I think it's important that the leaders of the Soviet Union and
the United States get together periodically,'' Baker said. ``It will
have been some time if we're looking at something into next year _
and I'm not saying that's the time frame we're going to give you in
Wyoming. But I think it's important they get together from time to
time and talk about the full range of problems between these two
countries.''
   Bush and Baker met with Shevardnadze for about an hour in the
Cabinet Room, along with aides on both sides. That session was
followed by another meeting, lasting about a half hour, in the Oval
Office, that excluded most of the aides.
   Shevardnadze said he delivered a letter from Gorbachev mostly
dealing ``with the entire complex'' of arms control issues.
   Baker said the letter ``in some instances restates long-held
Soviet positions. In some instances it puts new twists on those
positions.'' He declined to elaborate, saying the document required
more analysis.
   Baker described Gorbachev's letter as a reply to a June 20 letter
from Bush. ``This is a very serious letter. It is received by us in
a serious manner,'' Baker said. He said the United States would
reply to it in Wyoming.
   Baker said he hoped the Wyoming meeting would produce
``substantial progress'' on verification and stability measures
proposed by the United States for a strategic arms reduction treaty.
   Shevardnadze, talking with reporters, was asked if Bush had
disclosed any new initiatives. Bush had said Monday he had some
ideas that would capture the imagination of the Soviet people.
   ``There have been such suggestions on the American side, and we
certainly did not come here empty-handed,'' Shevardnadze replied.
   Describing the talks with Bush, Shevardnadze said, ``It was a
very interesting conversation, held in a very good atmosphere, also
a frank atmosphere.'' He said he was very pleased.
   Baker, at a separate briefing for reporters, said Bush expressed
the belief that the Soviet Union ``had proceeded very responsibly
and in a very measured way with respect to changes that are taking
place not just in the Soviet Union but in Eastern Europe as well.''
   Baker said Shevardnadze offered assurances that the Soviet Union
was not shippng weapons to Nicaragua. Baker said that U.S. officials
emphasized that shipments from the Soviet bloc have not diminished.
He said the subject would be discussed ``at some length'' in Wyoming.
   A senior Soviet official said Shevardnadze had brought a positive
response to the U.S. idea of ``trial verifications'' which would be
carried out before the conclusion of a treaty to cut strategic
nuclear arms.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the
Soviet side is carrying proposals concerning the prohibition of
weapons-grade fission materials. Gorbachev initially suggested such
a ban several months ago.
   As for the discussions on a reduction of conventional forces in
Europe, the official said Shevardnadze has brought proposals which
he believes will make possible the conclusion of an agreement within
the six months to 12 months suggested by Bush. Bush has proposed
massive cuts.
   Shevardnadze told reporters the Soviet side welcomes ``with
active support'' the ``open skies'' proposal set forth by Bush
several months ago, and wants further discussions.
   Under the proposal, the skies of both countries would be open to
reconnaissance flights of the other. It was the first time Moscow
had indicatedly publicly its interest in exploring that proposal.
   The White House session marked Bush's first direct contact with a
high-ranking Soviet official since taking office last January and
came amid complaints by congressional Democrats, as well as from
Moscow, about the pace of activity in superpower relations.
   Trying to capitalize on Gorbachev's campaign for ``glasnost,'' or
openness, the administration prepared proposals lifting virtually
all restrictions on travel by diplomats, trade representatives and
journalists in each other's countries, according to sources.
   About 90 percent of the Soviet Union is off limits to Americans,
reflecting the suspicions that marked the rule of Josef Stalin. Over
the years, the United States responded by imposing similar travel
restrictions on a large part of the United States.
   Baker's meetings with Shevardnadze are expected to produce
progress across a broad range of subjects, including in addition to
conventional arms:
   _CHEMICAL WEAPONS. The two sides are reportedly close to an
agreement to exchange information on their chemical weapons programs
and to open stockpiles and plants to inspections by the other side.
   Baker and Shevardnadze hope to resolve details, including whether
U.S. chemical weapons stored in West Germany would be covered.
   _NUCLEAR ARMS. The two sides are exploring steps to narrow
differences blocking an agreement to cut by 30 percent to 50 percent
the most deadly weapons in the superpowers' arsenals _ long-range
bombers, missiles and submarines. The Soviet delegation includes a
team of arms experts.
   The United States is withdrawing its proposal to ban mobile
long-range missiles, which Moscow has and the United States wants.
   _HUMAN RIGHTS. The Soviets have told U.S. officials that hundreds
of Jews who have been refused exit permits will be allowed to leave.
The Bush administration had presented lists of more than 500
so-called ``refuseniks.'' The Soviet Union reportedly said that
three-quarters could leave.
   _ICE CURTAIN. Baker and Shevardnadze are to sign an agreement for
regular visits between the Yupik and Inupiat Eskimos of Alaska and
Siberia, thereby shattering the so-called ``Ice Curtain'' that has
existed since the Kremlin forbade travel across the Bering Strait in
1948.
   _NUCLEAR TESTING. The two officials may reach agreement in
principle on methods of monitoring underground nuclear tests. That
would be an impetus toward Senate ratification of two long-stalled
nuclear testing treaties.

   A civil rights lawyer called Thursday for
the police chief's resignation over the alleged mistreatment of a
protected federal witness who was a key figure in a dramatic New
York City drug-and-murder case.
   Carl Maxey's client, who was moved to Spokane a year ago under
the name Amos Hardeen, said he was hit with a nightstick and called
a racial slur by officer Patricia Madsen after she stopped him and
cited him for speeding and running a stop sign.
   He also was cited for failure to obey an officer, resisting
arrest and third-degree assault after a brief scuffle outside his
home Sept. 1.
   Maxey contends that his client, who previously went by the single
name Arjune, was branded a liar by Police Chief Terry Mangan before
completion of an internal police investigation into his claim of
racial harassment.
   Mangan, in turn, accused Maxey of ``reverse racism.''
   Arjune was a key prosecution witness in a major cocaine trial in
New York City. He also testified against two of the four people
convicted of second-degree murder in the Feb. 26, 1988, shooting
death of Edward Byrne, a 22-year-old rookie police officer who was
guarding Arjune's house at the time.
   Arjune was relocated to Spokane last year and was recently moved
to an undisclosed location after his cover was blown.
   Spokane County prosecutors decided to prosecute Arjune for
resisting arrest, a misdemeanor, but dropped the felony assault
charge, deputy prosecutor Clark Colwell said. Arjune is forefeiting
bond in the case, Maxey said.
   Mangan said at a Sept. 11 press conference that the officer
denied Arjune's accusations and had passed a polygraph test. Mangan
said Arjune, described in New York as a Guyanese immigrant, lied in
his claim of harassment and tried to use his skin color to mask
criminal activity.
   Maxey said Thursday the chief's ``inappropriate, prejudicial and
personal comments'' and ``lack of adherence to standard police
procedure'' made it impossible for his client to participate in the
internal police probe.
   ``I called (Arjune) a liar because that's exactly what he did,''
Mangan said later. ``He tried to make it a phony racial incident by
lying about our officer and saying she called him a racial slur and
hit him with her nightstick.
   ``We'd be happy to hear Mr. Hardeen's side of the story if he
decides to give it, but we have documented proof that he gave a
false account of the events.''
   ``Arjune didn't hide behind his color,'' Maxey said. ``He wears
it as a badge of honor, and he's done far more in the war against
drugs than the police chief of Spokane.''
   Bill Dempsey of the U.S. Marshal's Service headquarters in
Arlington, Va., said the agency does not discuss specific cases or
confirm that a person is in the witness protection program.
   A witness would be dropped from the program for committing a
serious crime but not necessarily for minor offenses like traffic
infractions.
   ``The program is not a shield for a witness to hide behind,''
Dempsey said. ``The object of the program is to provide protection,
not immunity from the laws of the land.''

   A maid who discovered $100,000 at a Fort
Worth bank and turned it in with no thought of a reward is not
without honor in communities from California to West Germany.
   The woman was honored Wednesday in the northern Texas town of
Cleburne, where high school teacher Larue Barnes proclaimed the day
Nancy Carroll Day. Police escorted Ms. Carroll to a reception at
Cleburne High School, where a sign outside said: ``Welcome, Nancy
Carroll. Honesty pays.''
   The reception ended with a presentation by third-graders from
Adams Elementary School. Each wrote Ms. Carroll a letter of praise.
   ``We really, really love you. ... I'm so proud of you. ... God
bless you,'' wrote 8-year-old Kevin Webster.
   Since Ms. Carroll found the money while cleaning up at the bank
last month, cards, letters and money _ more than $700 _ have been
sent from people throughout the world with one message: ``Thanks for
being honest.'' She has carefully preserved the letters, newspaper
clippings and copies of the checks in a new photo album.
   ``Nancy Carroll should be acknowledged for her demonstration of
what a human being ultimately is,'' a man from Munich, West Germany,
wrote. Attached was a check for $100.
   Ms. Carroll said she is trying to keep a low profile.
   ``Gee, I'm sitting on top of the world,'' she said. ``It's not
going to last forever. I'm enjoying it while I can.''

   Maurice Faulkner has been known to pull a
prank or two, so it was no surprise that only one friend believed
him when he claimed he'd just chased a 6-foot lizard into the woods.
   ``We thought he was making it up,'' Ernie Bartlett said.
``There's not supposed to be anything like this in this part of the
country, and he has been known to josh you.''
   Faulkner told Bartlett that he thought the lizard, which was
lying in the road, was a log _ until the ``log'' lifted its head. He
stopped his truck and chased the lizard into the woods, where it
climbed a tree.
   But the lizard turned the tables, hissing loudly and thrusting
its long, forked tongue as it chased Faulkner. Eventually the
reptile burrowed into a hole in a creek bank.
   Bartlett's wife, Kay, a frequent viewer of National Geographic
television specials, identified the reptile as a monitor lizard.
   But even after a few more friends were convinced, no one wanted
to help Faulkner roam the woods of southern Arkansas at night to
seek a giant, hissing lizard.
   At daylight Sunday, a posse of seven set out armed with a shovel,
some rope, a net and a videocamera. The group captured the lizard
while the reptile was still parked in the hole with his tail
sticking out.
   The Bartletts have contacted zoos in Monroe, La., and Little Rock
about taking the lizard.

<HEAD>FBI Won't Appeal Court Order in Discrimination Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI says it won't appeal a federal court
order that directs changes in promotions and assignments to correct
what a judge called systematic discrimination against Hispanic
agents.
   The bureau made the announcement Thursday after Solicitor General
Kenneth Starr told the FBI he had accepted FBI Director William
Sessions' recommendation not to appeal the case.
   The May 5 order by a federal judge in Texas strips FBI
supervisors of the power to overrule decisions by the bureau's
career promotion board.
   It also set up a panel of three outside attorneys to decide if up
to 200 Hispanic agents should be promoted to make up for past job
discrimination.
   Sessions said in a statement that he recommended against
appealing the order after weighing ``the myriad legal, operational
and institutional considerations.''
   ``We must move beyond the frictions caused by this case to
address the many vital challenges facing the FBI in the 1990s,''
said Sessions, who added that dropping the appeal was in the best
interests of FBI employees.
   The decision was hailed by Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., who called
on the FBI to settle a racial harassment and discrimination lawsuit
filed by Donald Rochon, a black FBI agent now assigned to the
Philadelphia field office.
   Rochon claims he and his family were harassed by white agents
when he worked in Chicago and that he suffered retaliation by FBI
supervisors for pressing his complaints.
   ``That's exactly the right decision, something we've been urging
for many months,'' Edwards, chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil rights, said of the FBI's decision.
   ``It's time for them to move on and get at the root causes of the
problems,'' said the congressman.
   Bureau officials refused to comment on the Rochon case, except to
cite Sessions' previous statements that he intended ``to withhold
judgment until the facts have been adjudicated.''
   In the class-action suit joined by 311 of the FBI's approximately
400 Hispanic agents, U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton III of
Midland, Texas, directed the bureau to end its ``unsystematic
excessively subjective'' method of promoting special agents.
   Bunton said the ability of special agents in charge of field
offices to overrule promotion-board decisions was ``anathema to
nearly every reform advanced by the bureau and ordered by this court
to improve the fairness and reviewability'' of the process.
   The order followed two years of litigation launched in early 1987
by Bernardo M. Perez, then the No. 2 FBI agent in El Paso, Texas.
The suit was filed by Perez after a series of demotions from special
agent in charge of the San Juan, Puerto Rico, field office to El
Paso, which he termed an FBI ``dumping ground.''
   Bunton ordered Perez's promotion and he has since been appointed
deputy assistant director of the FBI's laboratory division in
Washington.
   In earlier rulings, the judge found that Hispanic agents were
often relegated to what one Hispanic agent has described as the
``taco circuit'' _ working in Hispanic neighborhoods or doing
language translations.
   Bunton concluded that Hispanic agents were often assigned to such
undesirable tasks as monitoring Spanish-speaking suspects on
wiretaps.
   After he took office in November 1987, Sessions reviewed all FBI
personnel and recruitment policies, saying he would tolerate no
discrimination.
   Sessions went outside the bureau to hire a new head of the
reorganized equal employment opportunity office.
   Bunton acknowledged these steps ``demonstrate energetic and
good-faith effort to correct the disparities found by this court.''
   But the judge said the FBI had to do more, saying the changes
already implemented ``while well-intentioned, are fine-tuning of a
system that requires more dramatic repair.''

<BYLINE>Broadcasters Consider Reviving Program Codes ^By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Responding to growing concern over raunchy
radio and TV, the nation's major broadcasting group is considering
restoring program codes that were dropped under government pressure
in the 1970s.
   The National Association of Broadcasters will canvass its members
and study whether to restore the codes because new Federal
Communications Commission Chairman Alfred Sikes urged radio
executives to shut down ``shock radio,'' NAB spokesman Walt Wurfel
said Thursday.
   Sikes urged broadcasters at a convention in New Orleans last week
to shun programs that use sexually and racially offensive humor to
attract audiences.
   Sikes said broadcasters should revive the codes that were
abandoned in the mid-1970s after the Justice Department initiated an
antitrust lawsuit against provisions of the codes involving
advertising. New codes should be drawn up by the industry, without
government pressure, said Sikes, the chief regulator of the radio
and television industry.
   Wurfel said the NAB's executive committee, in response to Sikes'
comments, told staff members ``to conduct an assessment of the
feasibility, effectiveness, legal and legislative elements of _ and
member support for _ devising a statement of standards or guidelines
concerning programming in the public interest.''
   Sikes, a former radio station owner who came to the FCC six weeks
ago, told the broadcasters' convention they were not ``simply
recorders, transmitters and antennas. We are what we broadcast.''
   He noted that on Aug. 24 the FCC announced it was considering
action against three radio stations in Chicago; San Jose, Calif.;
and Indianapolis for possibly broadcasting indecent programming
during daytime hours.
   That action was widely viewed as a warning shot across the bow of
broadcasters from a new, no-nonsense FCC. Sikes and new
commissioners Andrew Barrett and Sherrie Marshall faced tough
questioning during their Senate confirmation hearings in July on
what they proposed to do about indecency on the airwaves.
   Wurfel said the NAB, which represents more than 6,000 radio and
TV stations and the major radio and TV networks, was hesitant about
new codes in light of the Justice Department attack on the old codes.
   ``We don't desire to get into any further antitrust action,''
Wurfel said, adding that NAB also has to weigh First Amendment
concerns and community concerns.
   The House earlier this year passed a bill that would give the
television industry a three-year antitrust exemption so it can try
to adopt voluntary guidelines on violence.
   The Senate passed a similar measure that added antitrust
exemption for guidelines on portrayals of drug use and sex, and
differences in the two bills are now being worked out in a
House-Senate conference committee.

   The world's only condom that holds a
certificate of air worthiness won't be flying at this year's 18th
annual International Balloon Fiesta.
   The 12-story high, 45-foot wide hot air balloon, made from a
canary yellow nonflammable polyester and topped with a 10-foot
nipple, was refused entry.
   The owner, Dr. Malcolm Potts, said his balloon was turned down
because someone thought it obscene. But organizers say Potts'
application arrived too late.
   Potts, director of a non-profit AIDS prevention and family
planning organization near Raleigh, N.C., owns the balloon with
Phillip Harvey Enterprises Inc., a condom distributor.
   ``It's a good-natured symbol of a lifesaving object that won't
offend children,'' Potts said Thursday in a telephone interview from
Raleigh. ``But by making people smile it might assist them in
purchasing condoms for the first time and possibly save their
lives.''
   ``It may be adolescent and naughty, but it's not crude and
offensive,'' he said.
   The balloon, which was built in June, sports a banner that reads
``I Save Lives.'' It has flown a number of times in North Carolina
and over Montreal during an AIDS conference. The balloon was to have
raised money for AIDS projects during the Albuquerque fiesta, which
runs Oct. 7-15.
   Marge Ruppenthal, the fiesta's executive director, said the
owners of the condom balloon registered too late for entry.
   ``I don't know what the problem is,'' Ruppenthal said. ``They
called about the balloon coming, but after the deadline was extended
to Sept. 1 and I hadn't received any paperwork I couldn't accept the
entry.''
   But Mary Brady, owner of Above the Ordinary, which provides pilot
and crew for the condom balloon, said the fiesta committee told her
that a major sponsor of the fiesta, United New Mexico Bank,
threatened to withdraw its support if the condom was permitted to
fly.
   Sandy Miller, the bank's director of marketing, declined to say
whether the bank was opposed to the balloon. She said she was told
by the committee that the owners missed the deadline, so the bank
had no decision to make.

   Age and ``the rheumatiz'' are causing Burl Ives
to move a little slower these days, but he's still enchanting
audiences with his folk ballads, poems and tales of the American
past.
   ``That's what a song is for _ to sing it,'' said the 80-year-old
celebrated folk singer and actor. ``You can't put it in a box.''
   A little thinner than in his younger years but still sporting his
trademark white goatee, Ives gave one of his increasingly rare
recitals Thursday night at the Library of Congress to help celebrate
the Year of the Young Reader, a library initiative promoting book
reading among youngsters. First lady Barbara Bush is honorary
chairman of the project.
   As he has for years, Ives starts his program with some old
favorites, like ``Barbara Allen'' and ``The Old Lady Who Swallowed
the Fly,'' throws in a couple of cowboy songs, some Irish songs, a
few verses of poetry and a finale of songs ending with a lively
rendition of ``Jimmy Crack Corn.''
   Ives is an old friend of the Library of Congress, whose vast
collection of recordings includes several hundred folk songs by the
``Wayfaring Stranger,'' as Ives calls himself.
   His songs, also including ``Foggy, Foggy Dew'' and ``Blue Tail
Fly,'' are familiar to millions of Americans who grew up in the
1940s and 1950s and to successive generations of children who heard
his recordings.
   Besides his folk song concerts, Ives was a popular stage, radio,
television and movie performer. He won an Academy Award for
supporting actor in ``The Big Country'' in 1958, and is widely
remembered as Big Daddy in the stage and movie productions of
Tennessee Williams' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   A degenerative bone disease has forced Ives to reduce his concert
appearances from about 40 or 50 annually to ``a few in the fall and
a few in the spring.'' He spends much of his time at his new home on
Anacortes, an island off the coast of Washington state, where he
moved recently from California.
   Ives has slimmed down from the 270 pounds he used to carry. But
the familiar goatee is still there and his blue eyes still twinkle
when he tells a story or sings a song with his deep-chested tenor.
   In a pre-recital interview, Ives said he usually practices
singing every day to stay in shape, even though his repertoire
includes songs he has been singing for 75 years or more. He learned
some from his grandmother on a farm in Jasper County, Ill., and many
others during his hitchhiking tour of America with his guitar during
the Depression.
   Some music critics say Ives represents a link between
Anglo-American folk traditions of the 19th century, whose songs he
often sings, and the folk-rock styles of the 1960s.
   Speaking for himself, Ives says he loves the Nashville sound,
``those gentle folk-like songs that depend on their lyrics for
effect and not the thump of the rhythm section.''
   He doesn't have much use for rock'n'roll.
   ``I don't dislike it and I don't like it,'' he said. ``I just
don't pay much attention to it.''

<HEAD>Bush Will Bring Entire Cabinet to Education Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will involve nearly every
Cabinet member in his education summit with the nation's governors
next week because ``everyone has a responsibility'' to help improve
schools, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos says.
   ``It is a good move to involve the entire Cabinet because
certainly this is a national issue,'' Cavazos said Thursday at a
briefing on the two-day summit set for next Wednesday and Thursday
in Charlottesville, Va.
   ``We tend to think of education as being the purview of the
Department of Education,'' with its $22 billion budget, he
explained. Another $20 billion for education is spent by other
agencies, including the departments of Health and Human Services,
Labor, Defense and Agriculture.
   ``The quality of structure that each of these people will give
... in their area of responsibility can greatly impact the quality
of education,'' Cavazos said. ``Therefore, I think everyone has a
responsibility.''
   Roger Porter, Bush's domestic policy adviser, said the White
House is expecting perfect attendance from the governors of the 50
states, and several governors from U.S. territories will be there
with ``virtually the entire Cabinet.''
   The aim of the largely closed-door deliberations on the
University of Virginia campus will be to find new ideas to improve
America's schools, Porter said.
   The best ideas, including efforts to give parents more choice
over which public school their child attends, ``revolve around more
efficient use of the moneys that we are already spending,'' said
Porter.
   Such ideas do not require more money, he said.
   Democratic leaders of Congress on Wednesday unveiled their own
goals for the nation's schools and promised to press for
``adequate'' funding to help meet them.
   Porter said Americans are spending $353 billion on education at
all levels, from kindergarten through graduate school, including
more than $5,200 for every public school pupil.
   ``We're not going to be announcing any goals at the end of the
summit,'' Porter said. ``What we will be announcing will be the
process by which those goals are going to be developed.''
   The post-summit process of drawing up those goals ``will involve
parents and teachers and administrators and school boards.''
   Porter said the ideas that ``hold real promise for improving the
bottom line ... invariably expand choice for parents and students;
introduce greater flexibility, while demanding increased
accountability for results.''
   ``The president believes the current level of performance is not
acceptable and simply doing more of the same is unlikely to improve
it,'' Porter said. ``New approaches and new ideas are needed.''
   Although the agenda includes a discussion of expanding access to
higher education and training more teachers, the focus will clearly
be on problems in the lower grades.
   Porter, on leave as a professor of government at Harvard's
Kennedy School, said America's universities are ``really quite
phenomenal,'' in part because they are ``incredibly diverse and ...
highly competitive.''
   The topics for the six working groups, announced last week by the
governors, are: teaching, learning environment, governance, choice
and restructuring, a competitive work force and lifelong learning,
and post-secondary education.
   Bush will participate in each of the six working group sessions
with 16 or 17 governors and five or six Cabinet members.
   Each working group will be co-chaired by a Republican governor
and a Democratic governor, with a Cabinet member moderating the
discussion. A report will be prepared that the president and the
governors will consider in plenary sessions.

   The focus is on arms control in this latest
round of U.S.-Soviet talks, and the Bush administration knows how it
wants to approach that subject.
   But on the economic front, there is no decision yet on how much
help _ beyond good wishes _ to give Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the
Soviet president tries to restructure his country's industries and
agriculture.
   Arms control and economics are related. Reducing troops and
weapons gives Gorbachev more capital to spend on consumer goods and
other necessities.
   President Bush and his foreign policy advisers have made up their
minds in one respect, at least.
   They will move to conclude arms control agreements that are in
U.S. security interests. But they will not be ``frantic'' about it,
Secreary of State James A. Baker III said this week.
   On the economic front there have been only hints. The judgment
within the administration seems to be that Gorbachev's perestroika
program will succeed or fail mostly on decisions taken in Moscow.
   ``There are no simple or quick fixes,'' Baker said.
   But on some specific steps that could help Gorbachev, the
administration is still making up its mind.
   One is whether to give the Soviets the same kind of trading
privileges granted Hungary this week. Another is whether to support
membership for Moscow in the Geneva-based General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   The 96-nation GATT sets rules for international trade and settles
disputes among its members. Membership would be a break for
Gorbachev and give the Soviet economy greater acceptance within the
international trading community.
   Gorbachev is seeking at least observer status. He also wants
membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
   This summer Gorbachev entered a bid for links to the annual
summit meeting of the United States and six other industrialized
democracies _ Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany.
   He didn't get his foot in the door.
   Baker's advice this week to the Soviets was to help themselves by
pulling out of regional wars around the globe and redirecting
billions of dollars saved into the economy.
   ``They are spending billions of dollars in regional conflict
situations that we think could be put to better use to assist the
process of perestroika,'' he said.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger took a tougher
line last week in a speech at Georgetown University.
   He reminded the Western allies and Japan that Gorbachev ``is no
anti-communist'' and said they should avoid ``bankrolling merely
cosmetic Soviet reforms.''
   How bad is the situation in the Soviet Union?
   U.S. analysts are constantly reassessing the economic power of
the Soviet Union. They are interested mainly in how much capital the
Soviets are spending on their military programs.
   At a Central Committee meeting last year Gorbachev made an
admission that surprised some analysts here.
   He said growth figures in the 1970s under Leonid I. Brezhnev had
been boosted by high-priced oil sales and by the sale of vodka.
Otherwise, Gorbachev said, ``there was no increase in the absolute
growth of the national income.''
   World oil prices have been in decline in recent years. And
Gorbachev has put the kibosh on hard liquor as part of his revival
program.
   So the Soviet economy must still be hard-pressed.
   Some people would make the argument that the United States, its
European partners and Japan have a stake in Gorbachev succeeding.
They would argue he has lowered tensions while also trying to
improve conditions at home.
   Failure could usher in a hard-line successor.
   Others argue that the West should keep its distance and let the
Soviets figure their own way out of difficulty.
   Collectively, the Bush administration is not sure yet, but that's
the direction in which it appears to be going as Baker huddles with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Wyoming.

<HEAD>Rights Activists Decry Call For Swifter Executions</HEAD>

   Congress is being urged to move cautiously on a
new proposal to streamline death penalty appeals that civil
libertarians say could undermine fundamental rights of death row
inmates.
   ``We are concerned that fairness not be sacrificed for
expediency,'' said American Bar Association President Stanley
Chauvin in a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R.
Biden, D-Del.
   Chauvin said Biden should hold extensive public hearings on a
report announced Thursday by a committee appointed by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist. The ABA head also said the hearings should
await the lawyers' group own report on the issue due by November.
   The Rehnquist committee proposed a new system that could lead to
swifter executions. The panel, headed by retired Justice Lewis F.
Powell, proposed that fewer appeals be accompanied by more legal
help for condemned killers.
   Civil liberties lawyers accused Rehnquist of stacking the panel
and said the promise of expanded legal help is an illusion.
   ``They want to be able to kill more people faster,'' said Mary
Broderick of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association.
   ``It's a public relations ploy ... to facilitate the rush to the
gallows,'' said Leslie Harris of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Ralph Neas of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said the
committee plan means less protection against abuse by police and
prosecutors in capital cases, particularly for poor blacks.
   ``Imposition of the death penalty is hopelessly tainted by race
discrimination,'' he said. ``Not only does race discrimination drive
the decision to seek and impose the death penalty, it affects every
part of the proceeding.''
   But Powell said, ``The hard fact is that the (capital punishment)
laws of 37 states are not being enforced by the courts.''
   ``I respect those who argue for outright abolition of death
punishment but it seems irrational to retain the penalty and
frustrate its fair implementation,'' he said.
   Ironically, Powell said he would vote to abolish capital
punishment if he were a state legislator, contending, ``It has not
deterred murder.''
   The United States has the highest murder rate of any nation and
is the only democracy that has the death penalty, he noted.
   Powell said the committee's report is intended to reform a system
that encourages endless legal maneuvering, years of delay and
frenzied, last-minute moves to stave off execution.
   The report was submitted to the U.S. Judicial Conference, the
policy-making arm of the federal courts. The conference postponed
any action on the report _ and any recommendation to Congress _
until its 28 judges reconvene in March.
   The committee recommended that states enact laws to limit death
row inmates to two rounds of appeals in state and federal courts.
One round would challenge a verdict directly; a second would be
based on alleged violations of the condemned individual's rights.
   The current system permits successive rounds of appeals in the
federal courts.
   There are some 2,200 convicted murderers on death row across the
nation. There have been 118 executions since the Supreme Court
reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
   Powell said only a fraction of those convicted for the 20,000
murders committed each year are sentenced to die, and that the
average lapse between conviction and execution is more than eight
years.

<HEAD>University Drops `Grand Tradition' of Pre-Game Prayer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Georgia will end its ``grand
tradition'' of public prayer before football games because of the
likelihood it would not withstand a court challenge, the school's
president said.
   President Charles B. Knapp made the decision Thursday, hours
after Attorney General Michael Bowers advised him a threatened
lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union probably would succeed.
   ``I personally believe in the pre-game prayer,'' Knapp said. ``I
thought it was a grand tradition at the University of Georgia, and
I'm very, very saddened that we are going to have to discontinue
it.''
   Bowers said he believed a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision
banning pre-game prayers at high school athletic events also applied
to colleges and universities.
   ``I must conclude that the likelihood of successfully defending
the pre-game prayer at the University of Georgia is very slight,''
Bowers said in a letter hand-delivered to state university system
Chancellor H. Dean Propst.
   Knapp said Bowers told him that replacing the prayer with a
moment of silence would run the same risk as invocations.
   A student read a prayer over the Sanford Stadium public address
system before last Saturday's Baylor-Georgia football game, and
Knapp had said the invocations would continue unless he was advised
otherwise by Bowers or a court.
   Georgia Athletic Director Vince Dooley said he was dismayed by
the decision, though he supported it on legal grounds.
   ``The pre-game prayer has been a longstanding tradition at the
University of Georgia, but it has also been a great national
tradition all across the country. I'm disappointed the pre-game
prayer will no longer be part of our football and athletic
tradition,'' Dooley said.
   The case that went before the Supreme Court was brought by the
Georgia ACLU on behalf of a Douglasville, Ga., high school student.
   Hilary Chiz, executive director of the Georgia ACLU, said
Thursday she was glad a protracted court fight would be avoided. But
she said she had been confident all along the ACLU position would
prevail.
   ``I'm glad they understood that prayer in a state-supported
environment is a violation of the Constitution,'' she said. ``The
Constitution is safe. The First Amendment stands.''

   The war against drugs will require more money
and possible curbs on some traditional American freedoms, says Adm.
William Crowe Jr., the retiring chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
   The admiral, in a wide-ranging interview Thursday, said both
Congress and the nation's taxpayers will have to face the fact that
the battle is a full-fledged war and will be costly.
   ``If you want to stop the drug war, you are going to have to
spend more money. I don't see any way in the world to achieve more
and spend less,'' Crowe said when asked if enough funds have been
directed to the drug battle.
   President Bush and Congress are embroiled in discussions over the
cost of the nation's anti-drug strategy, with the Democratic
leadership pressing the president to put more funds into the fight.
   Crowe, who is scheduled to retire Oct. 1 after 43 years in the
service, said the nation's citizens also must face the fact that
some of their most cherished rights might need to be curbed in order
to purge the drug menace from society.
   Asked which rights could be limited, Crowe said, ``Search and
seizure. The most simple one is random drug testing. ... That is
what has allowed us to bring down the usage so heavily in the
military.''
   Crowe said many people ``want drugs to go away, but they don't
want the quality of their rights eroded.''
   Crowe also said the nation ``might consider doing unusual things
with the military'' to win the war against drugs.
   ``We are now looking at contributing much more heavily,
particularly in the land border in the United States,'' Crowe said,
indicating that military personnel could be used in stepped-up
reconnaissance duties or aiding the border patrol.
   ``If we want to fight it, and we want to whip it, we want to
prevent it, I would suggest that it does require unusual measures,''
Crowe said.
   The admiral also suggested banning the sale of assault weapons.
President Bush has banned imported assault weapons but has allowed
sales of U.S.-made versions to continue.
   Saying the nation has never ``seen the fiber of our society eaten
away by an insidious, uncontrollable threat,'' Crowe suggested that
in the anti-drug fight Americans might want to use the military in
new ways. ``That doesn't appall me,'' he said.
   He suggested the military might be used to help patrol the
nation's borders, saying, ``We're thinly stretched on the Southern
border ... and there are a lot of access routes.''
   He said he could not outline the Pentagon's role in great detail,
noting the military's plans were currently being worked out at the
command of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   But he said U.S. forces will not be drawn into anti-drug combat
overseas, and that Pentagon officials are not interested in shooting
down unidentified aircraft suspected of ferrying illicit narcotics
into the country _ a possibility suggested by some in Congress.
   The admiral, asked about the proliferation of guns in society,
said, ``I've never objected to measures that make you register your
guns. I think the most reasonable position seems to be, that we
should generally know where the guns are, and who owns them, and if
you own a gun you shouldn't insist on owning it clandestinely.''
   The 64-year-old former submariner is wrapping up two terms as the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he served as the
principal military adviser to the president and as the Pentagon's
top military leader.

<HEAD>Government Requires Headrests In Small Trucks, Vans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government, moving to reduce whiplash
injuries, will require light trucks, vans and sport-utility vehicles
to include headrests on the front seats.
   A senator sponsoring auto safety legislation praised the order
Thursday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but
said so many people are driving such vehicles that the safety
standards should be almost as tight as they are for passenger cars.
   The safety agency, which has required headrests for cars since
1969, said multi-purpose passenger vehicles assembled after
September 1991 would have to include the head supports.
   The rules cover all trucks and buses with a gross vehicle weight
rating of 10,000 pounds or less.
   Many manufacturers already include headrests in their vehicles.
   The order was prompted partly by motorists' widespread use of
light trucks and vans as ``substitutes for passenger cars,'' the
traffic agency said in a statement.
   Whiplash injuries most often occur when a vehicle is struck from
behind, throwing the occupants' heads back. Rehabilitation therapy
for such injuries often lasts a year or longer, the agency said.
   NHTSA estimated the new requirements will reduce the severity of
between 510 and 870 injuries each year. It said nearly 18,000
whiplash injuries are reported each year.
   ``These protections are not luxury options. They are basic
protections every family deserves,'' said Sen. John C. Danforth,
R-Mo.
   He said his legislation would also require that light trucks meet
minimum roof and side-impact standards, be equipped with high
center-mount brake lights and carry air bags or automatic seat belts.
   Danforth said small trucks, minivans and four-wheel drive
vehicles now make up about one-third of passenger vehicles sold in
the United States.
   Nearly 8,300 Americans were killed in light-truck crashes in
1988, he said.

<HEAD>USAir 737 Floor Buckled `Like a Roller Coaster'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Flight attendants couldn't open all the exit
doors and threw passengers seat cushions for use as life preservers
in the frantic evacuation of USAir Flight 5050, a flight attendants'
union spokeswoman says.
   ``The floor of the plane buckled up and down like a roller
coaster,'' said Cindy Yeast of the Association of Flight Attendants,
which gathered information Thursday about the crash from its members
assigned to the USAir jetliner.
   The flight attendants and cockpit crew were not made available to
news media after the Wednesday night crash at New York's LaGuardia
Airport. Federal investigators indicated they also were having
difficulty late Thursday finding crew members in their effort to
determine why the plane skidded off the end of the runway.
   The condition of the airliner, which broke into three pieces,
made it impossible for flight attendants to get all the exit doors
open, Ms. Yeast said. Two people sitting in the back of the
nine-month-old plane were killed.
   ``When the flight attendants realized passengers were going into
the water, they ripped off seat bottom cushions and began throwing
them out the door,'' she said.
   Current rules call for life vests only on flights that go more
than 50 miles over major bodies of water.
   Congress passed a law in 1987 requiring the Federal Aviation
Administration to make rules that would put life vests for all
passengers on all flights by U.S. carriers. The FAA has proposed but
not implemented the rules.
   Flight attendants and pilots began petitioning the FAA for
universal installation of life vests in 1980.
   Ms. Yeast said door slides can be used as rafts in cases where
planes go into the water, and most seat cushions also are designed
to float. Some passengers said they stayed afloat after the USAir
crash by clinging to driftwood in the water.
   After most passengers evacuated, flight attendants and the
plane's captain tried to use the inflated escape slide as a raft to
reach several passengers caught in the rear of the cabin, Ms. Yeast
said. But the slide deflated, apparently punctured by debris, she
said.
   The interior of the plane was dark, filling with water and
shifting in the current, Ms. Yeast said, as passengers yelled for
help from behind a place where the floor had buckled to the cabin
ceiling. Rescue crews helped pull out several passengers.
   Ms. Yeast said the pilot and last flight attendants stayed in the
aircraft trying to free passengers and left only after rescue
workers arrived and ordered them to evacuate.
   People were in the water for as long as 30 minutes, she said, and
some started singing as they awaited rescue.
   Ms. Yeast identified the flight attendants on the flight as Wayne
Reed, Jolynn Galmish, Susan Harrelson and Kelly Donovan, all based
in Baltimore. The airline declined to release the names of the
cockpit crew.

<HEAD>Senate Will Consider Flag Measures in October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate will take up a legislation to
prohibit burning the American flag in two weeks and will consider a
proposed constitutional amendment after lawmakers return from their
October recess.
   ``The primary interest is not whether we should provide
protection for the flag but what is the proper course to provide
that protection,'' Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said after the
Judiciary Committee sent the rival measures to the floor.
   The committee, by a 9-5 vote Thursday, approved the Democratic
statute to bar flag desecration but also voted 8-6 to send along
with an unfavorable recommendation the amendment favored by
President Bush.
   A July 14 agreement between congressional leaders required that
both measures be sent to the floor. Lawmakers plan floor action on
the bill as the last major item of business before the Senate goes
on its Oct. 6 recess and plans to take up the proposed amendment
soon after its Oct. 16 return.
   Thurmond, the committee's ranking Republican, argued that the
amendment as well as the proposed statute should get a favorable
recommendation.
   But Joseph Biden, D-Del., the panel's chairman and sponsor of the
statute, said the amendment ``does violence to the First Amendment
because it is so broad.''
   On Sept. 12, the House voted 380-38 to approve a similar statute.
The House has not yet voted on a constitutional amendment.
   The lawmakers are attempting to reverse the effects of a Supreme
Court ruling in June that threw out a Texas law used to convict
flag-burning protester Gregory Lee Johnson.
   Democrats, arguing against a change in the Constitution, said
nationwide interest in the issue has subsided after an initial
uproar. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said some lawmakers were
being driven by ``politics and fear.''
   ``There isn't any scourge of flag burning in this country,''
Metzenbaum said. ``It isn't one of those issues that the American
people are excited about.''
   Yet, he said, ``we are seriously thinking of cutting back on the
First Amendment just to avoid giving our opponents an issue. The
Bill of Rights is being held hostage to negative advertising spots
in the next election.''
   ``Can you imagine this?'' asked Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.
``Some creep who wants publicity (burns the flag) and we seriously
think of changing the Constitution?''

<HEAD>Panel Tells Sullivan Health Costs Need Urgent Attention</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a blue ribbon commission on health
care are pressing Health Secretary Louis Sullivan to speed up plans
to relieve the worsening burden of health care costs for Americans.
   ``We cannot continue sitting around here ... looking at the
problem. We've got to find some solutions,'' Sen. David Pryor,
D-Ark., a member of the Pepper Commission, told the secretary at a
hearing Thursday.
   With $31 million worth of studies conducted for the Department of
Health and Human Services last year ``there's enough evidence,
enough statistics for you to make recommendations'' within six
months, Pryor said.
   The commission, comprised of 12 members of Congress and three
White House appointees, is supposed to report its recommendations
for a comprehensive health and longterm care plan by March 1, 1990.
   Sullivan told the commission he has asked department officials to
bring him recommendations by October 1990 on changes in health and
long-term care financing.
   But Rep. Bill Gradison, R-Ohio, said there is no reason
Sullivan's recommendations can't be ready at the same time that the
commission puts its ideas on the table.
   ``I don't see why it should take so long,'' Gradison said.
``We're not experts in this, but you are.''
   ``We do share your sense of urgency,'' Sullivan told the
commission, formally called the U.S. Bipartisan Commission on
Comprehensive Health Care, which was created by Congress last year.
   Several witnesses showed the needs of the uninsured and those who
require long-term care by recounting their own medical horror
stories for the commission.
   Pamela Young of Dickson, Tenn., told the commission that in 1983,
when her husband was unemployed and uninsured, the couple separated
so she and her children could qualify for Medicaid to help pay
medical bills because of her daughter's kidney condition. Three
months later, when the girl's condition improved, her husband moved
back in with his family.
   ``It seemed wrong to have the government foot that bill, but it
was the only way we could think of to assure that Mary would get the
medical care she needed to make her well,'' Ms. Young said.
   Greg Nugent of Phoenix, Ariz., told of trying to get care for his
3-year-old son who had a malignant tumor in his head. Nugent was
self-employed but couldn't afford insurance when the child was
diagnosed in 1986 and went through a lengthy nightmare before they
eventually qualified for public medical assistance.
   ``I'm broke, I lost the house, I nearly lost my family and I'm
tired,'' he said, his voice cracking with emotion.
   ``If this commission could do one thing, it would be my request
to provide this information to our leaders: Let's take care of our
most important commodity _ the people of America, and not treat them
like dogs.''

<TEXT>
   This year's big storm is Hurricane Hugo. Last
year, Gilbert was a killer, and over the years Camille and Hazel,
Donna and Agnes have been the culprits _ a naming system intended to
give each storm a clear identity for the public.
   The designations can irritate or please human owners of the
names, depending on the violence of the storm involved.
   But the practice at least avoids confusion in issuing warnings
about particular storms, especially when more than one is under way
_ such as the current situiation with both Hurricane Hugo and
Tropical Storm Iris active.
   Naming these storms is a practice of long-standing, yet the
current system has been common only since World War II, and it was
modified about a decade ago to include male names.
   Using saints names, taken from the day a storm struck, was a
common practice for several hundred years, particularly in regions
that have a strong Spanish influence.
   A storm which struck Puerto Rico on July 26, 1825, for example,
became known as the Santa Ana storm.
   For meteorologists, a simple system of latitude and longitude
coordinates is used to locate storms. But that can be confusing to
the public, especially when there are two or even three storms at
the same time.
   Clement Wragge, an Australian meteorlogist active way back around
the turn of the century, may be have helped initiate the current
system.
   ``Inclement'' Wragge was a well-known lecturer on the weather who
began naming storms to help explain them to the public. He chose the
names of females for tropical storms, the type we call hurricanes,
and he used male names for other types of storms.
   Often the male names were those of politicians that Wragge did
not care for, and one of his earliest weather maps includes a storm
called ``Hackenbush,'' reports Ivan Ray Tannehill in his book, ``The
Hurricane Hunters.''
   During World War II military meteorologists found themselves busy
tracking hurricanes, and to avoid confusion named them using the
phonetic alphabet _ Able, Baker, Charlie and so on.
   Other armed forces weathermen began applying nicknames to
particular storms of all types they were tracking, explained the
late Frank H. Forrester, who was a Marine Corps weatherman in that
era.
   Nicknames such as ``Big Jack'' or ``Dopey'' were common, but,
``It was strictly informal, believe me,'' said Forrester.
   The use of women's names for hurricanes in recent years may stem
from the book ``Storm,'' by George R. Stewart. Published in 1941, it
tells of a weatherman who names storms after women.
   As public interest in hurricanes increased in the early 1950s,
officials of the Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau met to try and
develop a new naming system. This led to a system of female names
starting in 1953.
   The process of selecting the names was eventually shifted to the
World Meteorological Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, and
starting in 1978 male names were added, alternating with females.
   The World Meteorological Organization has lists of names that
rotate over periods of four or five years to keep them from
repeating too often. In addition, names of exceptionally damaging
storms are retired to prevent historical confusion.
   Last year, for example, both Gilbert and Joan were retired. When
their turn comes around again they will be replaced by Gordon and
Joyce.

<HEAD>Senate Confirms Powell to Chair Joint Chiefs of Staff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Colin L. Powell was confirmed by the
Senate early today to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff _
the youngest person and first black to hold the nation's highest
military post.
   Powell, 52, was approved on a voice vote without debate or
dissent. He will replace Adm. William Crowe Jr., who is scheduled to
retire Oct. 1 after 43 years in the service.
   Powell served as national security adviser in the final years of
President Reagan's administration.
   At his confirmation hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Armed
Services Committee, Powell said cuts in the Bush administration's
budget request for various weapons programs could undermine the
U.S.-Soviet pace on reducing strategic arms.
   Powell also said political changes in the Soviet Union should not
lead to cuts in the Star Wars program, land-based nuclear missiles
or the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Cuts approved by the House would ``completely unhinge'' the U.S.
negotiating position in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, Powell
said.
   ``Without the B-2, we no longer have the same START position that
we did for the last several years and I believe it most unlikely
that there will be a treaty up here to ratify,'' he told the
senators.
   He said he supported using the armed forces in the war on drugs
and in response to terrorist attacks. And, he said he was ``very
hesitant'' to cut U.S. troops in South Korea, Europe and other
overseas posts to satisfy current budget demands.
   Most recently, Powell was commander of the Army Forces Command in
Fort MacPherson, Ga., responsible for the combat readiness of 1
million troops on active, reserve or National Guard duty.
   Along with his predecessor as national security adviser, Frank
Carlucci, Powell was credited with helping the Reagan White House
recover from the Iran-Contra affair. He was a key figure in the
planning of Reagan's national security strategy and for his summits
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Before moving to the NSC, Powell commanded the Army V Corps in
West Germany for six months. Earlier, he was former Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger's senior military assistant from 1983
through 1986.
   Powell was born to Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City
and raised in the South Bronx.
   He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1958 and got his first
taste of the White House in 1972 as a White House fellow at the
Office of Management and Budget.
   Powell served as an adviser to South Vietnamese units in 1962-63
and as an executive officer of an infantry battalion and as a
division operations officer in 1968-69. He was awarded a Purple
Heart for being wounded in combat and a Bronze Star for valor.

   Heeding a frantic radio call from St.
Croix, two men chartered a small plane and daringly rescued their
parents from the chaos and destruction on the hurricane-ravaged
Caribbean island.
   ``My father managed to get to a boat (Wednesday) and radioed my
brother and _ he only was on for a minute _ he said, `Do whatever
you can to get us out of here,''' Kim Sorrelle said Thursday. ``My
parents were in fear for their lives.''
   Besides the destruction from Hurricane Hugo, a looting frenzy was
reported on the island, which still lacks water, power and telephone
service. U.S. troops began patrolling the island Thursday under
orders from President Bush to restore order.
   ``My father said it's total anarchy,'' Sorrelle said. ``The
island is completely destroyed.''
   She said her parents, Bruce and Mary Langlois, told of seeing a
local National Guard soldier use his gun to break the lock of a
jewelry store to loot, and that people were firing rifles from
rooftops.
   Chief Warrant Officer Layton Timmons of the Virgin Islands'
National Guard acknowledged that the U.S. Coast Guard had videotaped
some guardsmen taking part in looting.
   ``When two people start looting, the whole Guard gets the wrap,''
Thomas said. ``Don't condemn the organization.''
   Sorrelle's two brothers, Joel and Bruce Langlois, flew from Grand
Rapids to Miami late Wednesday, where they chartered a small plane.
After several telephone calls to the Coast Guard and Federal
Aviation Administration, they received clearance to land in St.
Croix on Thursday afternoon, she said.
   Because the chartered plane had eight seats, the Langlois' also
rescued four other people and flew to Miami, Sorrelle said.
   ``My mother said she was never happier to see anyone in her
life,'' Sorrelle said.
   The Langlois own a wholesale grocery business and store on the
island and visit about five days every other month. They had been at
their condominium since Sept. 14.
   ``They said their building was the only one left standing in
their condo complex after the storm,'' Sorrelle said.
   The Coast Guard said Thursday that about 600 people had been
evacuated from the island.

<HEAD>Republicans Taking Drug Plan to White House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican senators, following marathon
bargaining with Democrats, are taking a new plan for financing the
war on drugs to the White House for inspection by the Bush
administration.
   The blueprint, which sources said includes a 0.3 percent,
across-the-board cut in federal spending programs to raise money for
the drug war, could not be called a tentative agreement, Republicans
said Thursday.
   The sources, who asked not to be identified by name, also said
the plan contained some of the selected cuts in spending cuts in
spending the Bush administration had wanted as a way to offset
increases in the drug program.
   Republicans indicated that White House chief of staff John Sununu
had not agreed to the proposal in phone conversations Thursday and
added there was no deal without administration approval.
   Republicans said they would take the plan to the White House
Friday and then reconvene their negotiations with the Democrats.
   While senators declined to comment on specifics, sources said the
across-the-board cut envisioned in the proposal would amount to 0.3
percent. That would be an increase from a .2875 percent reduction in
a plan that Republicans carried into the negotiating session
Thursday afternoon.
   Under the Republican plan presented at the start of the session,
all but $23 million of an $850 million increase in the drug war
would have been funded with money raised through an across-the board
cut.
   That increase would have come on top of the $7.9 billion proposed
by Bush.
   Selected spending cuts under the new version would be determined
at the committee level, sources said. Democrats are planning
something similar to that but on a larger scale in the House.
   Agreement on some financing plan for the anti-drug effort is
needed to stop a Republican blockade of spending bills on the Senate
floor before the start of the next fiscal year Oct. 1, when they
will be needed to pay for the operations of the government.
   Four spending bills are awaiting passage in the Senate and eight
others are in the pipeline.
   GOP senators have been holding up passage for a week to bring
pressure on the Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, to
negotiate on how to finance the drug plan.
   Senators of both parties negotiated late into Thursday night in
an effort to get an agreement and start the money bills moving again.
   Bush called for a $7.9 billion anti-drug program. But Democrats
led by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said the administration did not
go far enough. They proposed boosting the spending by $2.2 billion,
with most of the additional money going for treatment, education and
prevent.
   The increase would have been funded with money raised through a
0.5 percent, across-the-board cut in all federal programs.
   The Bush administration opposed the plan, saying it would hit too
deeply at the Defense Department budget. The Democrats would have
require a $1.8 billion reduction in Pentagon spending.
   In such cases, however, accounts used to pay military personnel
are exempted from the cut.
   Republicans in negotiations earlier this week offered to add $800
million with $600 million for treatment and $200 million for local
law enforcement. It would have been funded in part with a .25
percent cut across the board. But they insisted on raising the
remainder of the money with offsetting cuts in a few selected
programs.
   Maintaining that all of the money should come from
across-the-board cuts, the Democrats on Wednesday night fashioned a
$1 billion offer.

<TEXT>
   This historic city has survived the
ravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied
300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in
Hurricane Hugo.
   The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into Charleston
Thursday night.
   ``This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few
people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have
experienced,'' warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.
   Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since
Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.
   The seaside community has suffered through many disasters, both
natural and man-made.
   The worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado tore
through the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causing
an estimated $2 million in property damage.
   Charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures lining
quaint streets and alleyways, is where the Civil War began in 1861.
   The city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any
number of smaller hurricanes, politely referred to by Charlestonians
of refinement as ``September gales.''
   But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the
hot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what some
folks thought was a prelude to Judgement Day.
   The great Charleston earthquake was felt as far away as Chicago
and New York City.
   Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, the
earthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildings
and tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimneys into the streets.
   In recent years, the city has attracted millions of visitors
annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine
sand beaches.
   Charleston has received international acclaim as home to Spoleto
Festival U.S.A., founded by composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Organizers
like to refer to Spoleto as the world's most comprehensive arts
festival.

<TEXT>
   The dollar closed at 145.00 yen Friday, unchanged
from Thursday's close, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange rose slightly.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
274.44 points Thursday, added another 13.48 points, or 0.03 percent,
closing the week at 34,758.50.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained in a narrow range ahead
of this weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven nations in
Washington. Speculation that Japan's central bank may step into the
market if the dollar rises above the 146-yen level also put the
brake on the dollar's upward moves, they said.
   ``The dollar's upswing has slowed down because players are
reluctant to buy any more dollars before the G-7 meeting tomorrow,''
said Minori Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   Financial ministers from the G-7 industrialized nations _ the
United States, Britain, West Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and
France _ will gather in Washington on Saturday to discuss
international monetary policy.
   On the stock market, the market's main barometer started firm
with broad small-lot buying, but then eased with many investors
taking a wait-and-see position to watch moves in the exchange rates,
stock dealers said.
   ``With the approach of the weekend, the index failed to maintain
its momentum, reflecting the yen's declining trend,'' said a dealer
with Nomura Securities who spoke anonymously.

<TEXT>
   A Texas judge picked by President Bush to head
the Office of Government Ethics has been ruled out after an FBI
background check found ``disqualifying'' information, according to a
published report.
   Paul Pressler of Houston had not yet been formally nominated for
the post, but the routine background check was being conducted in
preparation for that, The Washington Post reported in today's
editions.
   ``Information was uncovered we felt was disqualifying,'' an
official, whose identity was not disclosed, told the newspaper.
   Anonymous officials cited by The Post would not give details of
the contents of the FBI report, except to say that it did not
contain allegations of crimes or financial improprieties.
   The Post identified Pressler as a civil court judge and a leader
of a fundamentalist movement within the Southern Baptist Convention.
   Pressler, reached by telephone in San Francisco by The Associated
Press, said no one at the White House had contacted him about the
information in the FBI report or to say that he had been
disqualified for the ethics post.

<NOTE>Bush Asks Congress for Money to Help Nicaraguan Opposition</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has formally asked
Congress for $9 million to help the election campaign of Nicaraguan
opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a message to
congressional leaders Thursday asking for the assistance, called the
February 1990 election between Chamorro's opposition coalition and
incumbent Sandinista president Daniel Ortega ``a rare chance for us
to support democratization in a totalitarian society.''
   Initial reaction was positive, although most congressional
Democrats were still evaluating the proposal. After a White House
meeting with President Bush, former President Jimmy Carter _ who
will be an observer at the elections _ said he would support the
initiative.
   The administration wants to rush legislation through Congress in
the next week or so to make money available in time for Nicaragua's
one-month voter registration season in October.
   Baker said Chamorro has a chance to win, but added, ``We
shouldn't be under any illusions about the battle they face.'' He
noted that the Sandinistas would use all resources at their command
_ the army, the secret police, the government bureaucracy and mass
organizations _ to further their political fortunes.
   Despite the odds, the opportunity to install a new government is
a rare opportunity, he said.

<NOTE>Court Ruling Threatens Government Suits Against Employers</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen government lawsuits alleging
age discrimination by employers may have to be dismissed unless
Congress restores protections overturned by the Supreme Court, a
government lawyer says.
   Charles A. Shanor, general counsel of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, testified Thursday at a House hearing in
support of legislation to reverse a June ruling that bias in fringe
benefits is not automatically banned under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act.
   The high court ruled 7-2 that federal law bans biased benefit
plans only where the disparities are part of an attempt to
discriminate in ``some non-fringe-benefit aspect'' of employment
such as hiring or firing.
   Shanor said the EEOC has more than 30 cases pending in courts
around the country in which it alleges that employers discriminated
against older workers by limiting their fringe benefits.
   ``We estimate that over half of these cases would require
dismissal ... absent remedial legislation,'' Shanor told a joint
hearing of the House Select Committee on Aging and two Education and
Labor subcommittees.

<HEAD>Senate Votes Slight Liberalization of Abortion Restrictions</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Final vote on bill expected after noon EDT</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Conservative lawmakers are counting on their
House allies and a sympathetic president to tone down eased abortion
restrictions adopted by the Senate.
   Outnumbered anti-abortion senators offered little resistance
Thursday as the Senate by voice vote agreed to allow federal aid for
abortions for pregnancies threatening a woman's life or caused by
rape or incest.
   The expansion of the government's role in paying for abortions
was included in a measure providing $157.4 billion for health,
education and labor programs for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.
Final passage of the bill, and other spending measures, was blocked
by Republicans as the two parties worked on an unrelated anti-drug
package.
   Current law limits federal assistance for abortions to pregnant
women whose lives are endangered. President Bush has promised to
veto an expansion of that restriction, and the House last year
refused to stretch the limits further.
   ``House conferees have been very adamant on that point in past
years, and I'd expect them to be the same this year,'' said Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., referring to House negotiators who will
seek a compromise with their Senate counterparts.
   Pro-choice advocates said the vote showed congressional momentum
was shifting their way. But they conceded that based on last year's
experience _ and Bush's veto promise _ it will be difficult for the
Senate language to be enacted.
   ``This is the beginning of a very slow road back to where women
who desperately need access to reproductive health care will have
access to it,'' said Pat Reuss, lobbyist for the Women's Equity
Action League.
   Though they lost ground on abortion, conservatives won points
elsewhere in the legislation.
   The Senate voted 95-3 for language sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., blocking federal money for public education on AIDS to
states that don't require authorities or doctors to notify people
whose spouses are found to be infected with the AIDS virus. The bill
provides $195.8 million for the initiative.
   Lawmakers decided by voice vote to bar federal financing of
materials for school children ``which promote or encourage
homosexuality, or use words stating that homosexuality is `normal,'
or `natural,' or `healthy.''' The measure was introduced by Humphrey.
   Senators voted 99-0 to prohibit the use of federal aid to buy
hypodermic needles for illegal drug users or bleach to clean the
needles, unless the president certifies that the efforts are
effective.
   By another 99-0 tally, they adopted a compromise permitting
federal aid for telling people how to limit the risk of getting
AIDS. The measure allows references to safe ways of engaging in
sexual acts as well as the risks of engaging in promiscuous sex and
intravenous drug abuse.
   The legislation also provides $1.6 billion for AIDS research and
treatment, $370 million more than this year; $1.2 billion for added
child care programs; and $23.7 billion for education, $1 billion
above this year's level.
   Earlier this summer, Congress passed legislation easing abortion
restrictions in Washington, D.C., despite a Bush veto threat.
   The Senate last year voted 73-19 for the same language it
considered Thursday. After negotiations with the House, the final
version only allowed federal aid for pregnant women whose health was
at risk.
   This year's House version of the bill, passed Aug. 2, has the
same abortion language as current law.
   Since 1981, Congress has limited abortion aid under the Medicaid
program for the poor to women whose pregnancies are threatening
their lives.
   There were 72 abortions involving rape or incest financed by the
federal government in 1979, the last year for which reliable figures
are available, according to a survey by the private Alan Guttmacher
Institute.
   In fiscal 1987 _ the most recent year for which figures are
available _ the federal government paid for 322 abortions nationwide
at a cost of $160,000, the institute says. The study found that the
same year, states paid for 189,000 abortions.
   There are an estimated 1.6 million legal abortions in the United
States annually.

   Hurricane Hugo ripped into South Carolina today and rain and
thunderstorms that spun off of the storm were scattered across much
of the eastern United States, while an arctic cold front bore down
on the Great Lakes.
   Skies were clear over most of the West.
   Showers and thundershowers were reported Thursday from the Gulf
Coast north into the Ohio River Valley and into New England.
Thunderstorms also struck the lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas.
   The Great Lakes region was expected to usher in autumn Saturday
with a chill. A cold front approaching the area today could drop the
mercury 20 degrees overnight, according to the National Weather
Service, and frost is likely.
   Hurricane winds over 100 mph knocked out power to the entire city
of Charleston, S.C. and cracked the roof at City Hall. The storm
ripped off roofs and snapped and uprooted trees in parts of the
state.
   Temperatures elsewhere Wednesday afternoon climbed into the 90s
in much of Florida, the 80s across the south, the 90s in southern
Texas and the 80s and 90s in the desert Southwest.

   Vice President Dan Quayle and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher today told fellow conservative politicians not to
become complacent in the war against oppression, poverty and other
threats to democracy.
   ``Though there are many hopeful signs around us today, the
threats remain,'' Quayle said in a keynote speech to the
International Democratic Union. ``Indeed, some new threats have
appeared.''
   Quayle cited the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nations
engaged in chemical weapons research such as Libya and Iraq.
   ``Moreover ... the Soviet strategic threat remains formidable,''
he said.
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who as head of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party opened the conference of
politicians from 26 nations, noted that ``the evolution of arms
control and disarmament is moving toward dialogue and away from
confrontation.''
   Mrs. Thatcher joined Kaifu in urging support for democratic and
economic reforms in communist nations but said strong defenses were
necessary to counter military threats. She also reiterated her
opposition to unilateral reductions in nuclear and conventional
forces in Europe.
   ``It is our job as conservatives to make people aware of the
dangers and the vital importance of keeping our defenses strong,''
Mrs. Thatcher said.
   ``As we look round the world, there are still enormous problems
of conflict, subversion, oppression, poverty and environment ...
requiring our attention,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher was to leave today for Moscow to meet with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Conference speakers also cited global environmental problems,
drugs and terrorism as serious threats to mankind.
   ``We are all grateful that President Bush has mobilized the
enormous power of the United States against the drug cartels,''
Kaare Willoch, chairman of the International Democratic Union and
former prime minister of Norway, said in his report to the
conference.
   Quayle called on the other conservative leaders to support
democracies in Latin American.
   ``We must demand that the Nicaraguan government act now ... to
establish the conditions for genuine political pluralism and we must
act on our own,'' he said.
   The conference admitted a new member, the Movimiento Accion
Solidaria of Guatemala, to its ranks and elected Andrew Peacock,
leader of Australia's opposition Liberal Party, to be its new
chairman.
   On Saturday, Quayle is to visit U.S. military bases in Japan with
his wife, Marilyn. Next week, he is to hold talks with Kaifu and
other Japanese leaders before traveling to the Philippines and
Malaysia.

   Plans for mandatory AIDS tests for
foreigners have been drastically trimmed because of strong
opposition from other governments, the Health and Social Affairs
Ministry said today.
   Officials said the revised plans call for mandatory AIDS tests
for foreign entertainers and athletes staying in the country for 91
days or longer and for refugees.
   They said, however, that foreign entertainers and athletes who
are accompanied by spouses will be exempt.
   The ministry's original proposal also included foreigners
employed by Korean companies and government agencies, and foreign
students.
   Ministry officials said several foreign embassies warned that
their governments would be compelled to impose similar requirements
on Koreans if the original plans were carried out.
   Korean sailors returning home from overseas, prostitutes and
restaurant employees are required to be tested for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. There is no known cure for AIDS, which destroys
the body's ability to fight disease.
   Forty-seven Koreans are infected with the deadly disease,
according to health officials.

   The remains of an exiled 19th century
Argentine leader were exhumed for return to Argentina on Oct. 1, an
Argentine official said.
   Descendants of Juan Manuel Rosas, a leading Buenos Aires governor
who died in 1877, gathered Thursday at a cemetery in the south coast
port of Southampton for the exhumation, said Julio Mera Figueroa, an
adviser to Argentine President Carlos Menem.
   Argentina tried several times to have the remains returned.
Earlier this year Britain, seeking to restore diplomatic relations
cut during the 1982 Falklands War, said it would not obstruct the
move.
   Rosas dominated Argentine politics for 20 years before being
ousted by rivals in 1852. He sought refuge in England.
   British and Argentine officials are to meet in the Spanish
capital of Madrid Oct. 17-18 to try to normalize relations.

   China's top entrepreneur said today there are
still good profits to be made in the communist nation and he is
optimistic foreign investors will return despite the crackdown on
pro-democracy activists.
   Rong Yiren, chairman of the China International Trust and
Investment Corp., said it will take up to three years for China to
overcome its economic problems. He also expressed confidence that
his company, a target of recent government investigations, would
continue to prosper.
   Rong, 73, spoke to reporters as his company, knowns as CITIC,
prepares to mark the 10th anniversary of its founding as a highly
independent investment firm under the auspices of the State Council,
or Cabinet.
   He said China's economic difficulties were excessive growth, 20
percent inflation, energy and raw materials shortages and
profiteering. But he said the problems had eased somewhat under a
government austerity program that severely restricted spending and
put new market-oriented reforms on hold.
   ``My view is that in the future the situation may be a little
better, but it may take two or three years,'' Rong said.
   He said his company also is facing a tough year and profits could
be down from the record $64.6 million of last year.
   But he stressed that the recent government drive to reorganize or
shut down some freewheeling investment and trade corporations
accused of profiteering and corruption ``have nothing to do with
CITIC.''
   Rong said the company paid a $5 million fine imposed by the
government last month after a 10-month investigation into illegal
trading in foreign exchange, reselling production materials at a
profit and evading taxes.
   Foreign enthusiasm for new investment projects in China has been
dampened by the recent austerity measures and political instability
and tensions following the military suppression of the student-led
democracy movement.
   Rong said China International was pushing ahead with foreign
investment, and recently signed an agreement with Italian and South
Korean companies to set up a plastics manufacturing plant in Hong
Kong.
   The company also owns a bank in Hong Kong and has bought into
Cathay Pacific airlines, an aluminum smelter in Australia, a pulp
mill in Canada, timber in the U.S. Northwest, real estate in Arizona
and a steel plant in Delaware.
   Inside China, much of its investment goes to heavy industry,
although its 23 subsidiaries are involved in the banking, real
estate, trade, travel, hotel and publishing industries.
   Rong, scion of one of pre-Communist China's most wealthy
families, worked as a janitor during the ultra-leftist Cultural
Revolution.
   China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, asked him to put his
capitalist skills to work when China International was formed in
1979 to attract foreign funds.
   Although not a Communist Party member, Rong today is vice
chairman of the National People's Congress, the nation's
legislature, and chairs the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republicans narrowly lost a ``winnable''
special election for former Rep. Jim Wright's seat in Texas because
GOP officials ignored President Bush's offers to campaign there,
charges White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   ``The White House, from the very beginning, made it clear that we
were willing to send the president,'' Sununu said in an interview
published in today's editions of The Washington Times. ``We wanted
to send the president.''
   But Sununu said the Republican National Committee and the
Republican Congressional Committee ignored Bush's repeated offers.
   Democrat Pete Geren won the seat, which was vacated when House
Speaker Wright resigned, in a Sept. 12 special election. Geren
earned 40,210 votes to Republican Dr. Robert Lanier's 38,590.
   ``I was absolutely convinced from the beginning, and the
president was convinced from the beginning, that a Texas election in
a special election mode was winnable,'' Sununu told The Times.
   Neither RNC Chairman Lee Atwater and congressional committee
Chairman Ed Rollins was available for comment.
   Someone at the White House actually rejected a Sept. 7
congressional committee request for the president to make a
satellite television appearance, John Buckley, the group's director
of communications, told The Times. That decision was reversed the
next day after Atwater telephones Sununu aboard an Air Force One
flight to New Orleans, Buckley said.
   Bush talked live with the GOP candidate via satellite at a forum
of 400 supporters 48 hours before the polls opened.
   ``My understanding is they got everything they asked for,'' said
Leslie Goodman, a spokeswoman for Atwater.

   A Soviet official issued a public but
conditional invitation today for Vice Premier and Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres to visit the Soviet Union.
   Such a trip would be another step in renewing ties between Israel
and Moscow. But several supposed invitations issued recently by
Soviet officials have ended in canceled trips and embarrassment for
the Israelis.
   Henrich Borovik, head of a Soviet trade group that met Peres in
New York on Thursday, was the first Soviet official to make a public
invitation to an Israeli government minister. Peres confirmed the
invitation in a radio interview from New York.
   ``(We are) inviting Mr. Shimon Peres as our guest to Moscow,''
Borovik said in a statement broadcast on Israel radio today.
   Borovik is a member of the Permanent Committee of Foreign
Relations of the Supreme Soviet. But he issued the invitation on
behalf of the non-governmental Soviet Peace Committee he heads and
said that group would have to approve it.
   ``I think he (Peres) has a good chance. ... I already said that
my personal invitation he already got, but we certainly have to
discuss it on the bureau of the Soviet Peace Commitee. I hope that
they will react positively.''
   The invitation was extended after a 45-minute meeting with the
four-member Soviet trade delegation, the radio said.
   Peres, interviewed in New York, told Israel radio:
   ``I've received an invitation and I think there is an opening for
economic relations between Israel and the Soviet Union. The areas
that interest us and them are agriculture, medicine, air traffic and
tourism. We have a lot to discuss.
   ``We found a great deal to discuss together, to contribute to our
economies and eventually to peace in the area and peace in the
world,'' Peres added. ``But I always believe it's better to talk
after the deed is done.''
   Earlier this month, Agriculture Minister Avraham Katz-Oz, invited
by two of his counterparts from Soviet republics, canceled a trip
after authorities in Moscow denied him a visa.
   On Aug. 16, a spokesman for Trade Minister Ariel Sharon said
Sharon was invited to the Soviet Union by his Soviet Georgian
counterpart, who was visiting Israel at the time. Sharon was due to
leave for Georgia in October but then the Soviet Foreign Ministry
denied any invitation was issued.
   The Soviets say renewal of diplomatic ties with Israel depends on
progress in the Middle East peace process. Moscow and all other
Eastern European states apart from Romania cut diplomatic relations
with Israel following the 1967 Middle East war to protest Israel's
seizure of land from Moscow's Arab allies.
   Israel and the Soviet Union have exchanged low-level diplomatic
missions in the last three years. This week, Hungary became the
first East bloc nation to renew full diplomatic ties with Israel.

<HEAD>Police Clash With Leftists Protesting Quayle Visit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police clashed today with about 1,000
leftists protesting next week's visit of Vice President Dan Quayle,
and officials said at least six people were arrested.
   Officials also said military units in the capital had been placed
on alert following a series of bombings that killed at least two
people and injured 14.
   President Corazon Aquino said there was no evidence of a new coup
attempt but that the bombings could be ``intended to destabilize the
government.''
   Witnesses said today's clashes occurred as members of various
left-wing organizations tried to march to the U.S. Embassy to demand
that Quayle's visit be canceled. He is to arrive Tuesday.
   Marchers were blocked by about 30 policemen who beat the
protesters with truncheons and began firing tear gas, witnesses
said. Protesters then hurled small homemade explosives at the
police, injuring several officers and at least three news
photographers.
   Police said the six arrested included a Japanese student, Taizo
Hisano, 27, of Kyoto University.
   ``I can't believe what police did,'' Hisano told reporters as he
was being led away.
   Police said those arrested would be charged with illegal assembly.
   During the march, protesters unfurled banners saying ``Quayle,
you're not welcome here'' and ``Dismantle the U.S. bases.'' Leftists
have promised bigger demonstrations during Quayle's three-day visit.
   Several Manila newspapers reported the government was concerned
about a possible new attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino before she leaves
for the United States in November. She pledged to go ahead with her
visit to Canada and the United States despite the bombings and
military alert.
   Two people were killed Saturday when assailants hurled a grenade
in a crowded market area in downtown Manila. On Monday, 14 people
were injured in a grenade blast at another market. A third grenade
exploded Monday in suburban Pasig, but there were no injuries.
   ``The red alert ... was to abort more possible bombing
incidents,'' military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said
today. He told reporters Mrs. Aquino had ordered the alert Thursday
and troops would increase mobile patrols and checkpoints in greater
Manila.
   Late Thursday, troops were stationed at the Mendiola Bridge,
about 300 yards from Mrs. Aquino's residence.
   Mrs. Aquino has survived at least six armed attempts against her
government since she took office after a popular uprising toppled
President Ferdinand Marcos three years ago. Similar small-scale
bombings preceded coup attempts in November 1986 and in January 1987.

   The attorneys for a former Indian prime minister
are seeking the testimony of Henry Kissinger in a $100 million libel
suit against journalist Seymour Hersh.
   Attorney Cyriac Kappil said Thursday he was giving Kissinger the
opportunity to appear voluntarily before invoking a subpoena of the
former secretary of state, who was the subject of Hersh's 1983 book,
``The Price of Power.''
   Kappil also said he was considering using a videotaped deposition
made by Kissinger if he was unsuccessful in procuring his direct
testimony.
   Morarji Desai, India's prime minister from 1977 to 1979, has
accused Hersh of defamation for presenting Desai as a paid CIA
informant in the book.
   Hersh testified on Thursday that while he made some biographical
mistakes about Desai in the book, he was convinced of Desai's role
with the CIA.
   ``The thing that's important there is to know the sources were
sources I had the utmost confidence in,'' Hersh testified. ``That
was the driving force behind what I wrote.''
   Hersh acknowledged errors of fact _ among them the mispelling of
Desai's first name and the year in which Indira Gandhi, Desai's
rival, returned to power in India.
   The mistakes, which are not the subject of the lawsuit, were made
in the first printing of the book but corrected in later editions,
he said.
   Questioned about his accuracy in reporting and writing, Hersh
said his objective was to be truthful.
   ``I follow the truth, is what I'm trying to do,'' he said.
   Hersh, who testified that six sources told him Desai worked as an
informant for the CIA, acknowledged that in two 1983 interviews he
had said there were only two sources for this information.
   Under questioning, Hersh declined to reveal the name of one
source, an Indian foreign service officer in Washington, D.C. Hersh
said he submitted part of his manuscript prior to publication to the
source for verification of its accuracy.
   Under U.S. libel law, Desai's attorneys must convince the
six-member jury that Hersh knowingly printed false, negligent or
malicious material.
   Hersh won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1970
for his articles exposing the My Lai massacre in Vietnam. He was
also a reporter for The Associated Press and The New York Times
before resigning the latter to pursue his own writing and reporting
projects.

   Federal investigators are turning their attention
to the flight crew of a USAir jetliner after cockpit recorders
failed to show why the pilot aborted takeoff, causing the airliner
to slide into the East River, killing two passengers.
   The New York Times and the (New York) Daily News today quote
unidentified authorities as saying the co-pilot said the pilot was
``mumbling'' and ``acting irrationally'' just before takeoff.
   Reports said when the pilot left the plane he refused to speak to
investigators on the advice of his lawyer. The pilot and co-pilot
have the right to decline interviews, but the National
Transportation Safety Board can subpoena them, says NTSB spokeswoman
Rachel Halterman.
   The Times said the co-pilot gave his report to Port Authority
police, but Port Authority spokesman John Hughes said he knew of no
interviews that agency police had with the crew.

   A judge's ruling in a divorce custody
battle over seven frozen human embryos that life begins at

   Regina Smith, executive director of the Pro-Life Council of
Connecticut, called the court's decision ``a victory for unborn

   Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young awarded temporary

   The AIDS virus is able to use one of the body's
major disease fighters to help overwhelm the immune system and leave
the patient unprotected against infection, according to a new study.
   In a report published today in Science, Dr. Michael K. Hoffman of
the Sloan-Kettering Institute said experiments in his laboratory
show that an antibody made by the immune system to attack the AIDS
virus is turned by the virus into a weapon against the immune system
itself.
   The finding, said Hoffman, suggests that some types of vaccine
against the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS,
could actually help the disease instead of protecting the body.
   ``In terms of vaccination, our data provides some alarming news
because you would have to realize if you immunize (with a vaccine)
you also produce antibodies that might be rather harmful,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Daughter Writes Novel About `My Father's War' In Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patti Davis, at odds with parents Ronald and
Nancy Reagan when she wrote her first book takes aim at a family
target again in a new novel about fighting in Nicaragua that she
calls ``my father's war.''
   ``Deadfall,'' the second novel by the daughter of the former
president and first lady, is a political thriller scheduled to hit
the bookstore shelves next week, about one month before the release
of Mrs. Reagan's memoirs.
   The book is about a young couple who try to make a documentary
film on the horrors of the guerrilla war in Nicaragua, with the plot
twisting around spies, stolen film, murder and evidence of America's
illegal involvement in the war.
   ``The CIA created, armed and financed the contras,'' said Ms.
Davis, 36, of Santa Monica. ``My father backed them with everything
he had. It was my father's war and almost everyone in Nicaragua has
lost somebody as a result of it.''
   Ms. Davis said her father's support of the Central American armed
conflict made it too dangerous for her to go to Nicaragua to
research her book.
   ``I couldn't go down there, being his daughter, and expect not to
feel those people's wrath,'' she said.
   Her first novel ``Home Front,'' about child smothered by her
father's political career, widened the rift between her and her
family. It created an embarrassing situation for Reagan, who was
sounding his frequent call for a return to family values.
   Ms. Davis makes no excuses, saying she had to write her first
novel honestly about something she knew _ even if the truth was
unpleasant to some.
   ``Anyone who hasn't been living in a coma for the last eight
years knows that we're not a close-knit family,'' she said.

<HEAD>Study: Day Care May Be Safer Than Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children may be safer from injury at day-care
centers than at home, according to a researcher who suggests that
more attention to playground hazards could reduce injury rates.
   A study of injuries at Atlanta day-care centers revealed a lower
overall death rate for children at day-care centers than children at
home.
   Dr. Jeffrey Sacks, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, noted that of the 27 children under 5
years old who died from injuries in the last 6 months of 1987 none
were in child-care.
   ``Parents have always had the bad news that kids in day care are
at increased risk of infectious disease,'' Sacks said. ``Here's some
good news for a change: they are probably at less risk of injury and
death from injury than they are when they're not at day care.''
   Sacks and his colleagues studied 143 injuries among 5,300
children at 71 Atlanta day-care centers between June 1987 and May
1988. Centers reported any injury that required medical or dental
attention to the researchers, whose study was published in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The researchers said that 3.5 percent of children in day care
could be expected to be injured at the center in a given year. They
extrapolated from their data that, if children were to stay at day
care 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, 14 percent would incur an
injury.
   ``A typical injury rate for children in a community in one year
is about 35 percent,'' Sacks said. ``That suggests to us that
children in child care are probably safer than when they are in the
community at large.''
   Dr. George Stern, a New Orleans pediatrician, said although he
hadn't seen the new study ``there is a certain amount of logic to
it.''
   ``In a well-supervised day-care center the environment has been
looked at for hazards probably more than in the average home,'' said
Stern, who edited a day-care manual for the American Academy of
Pediatrics.
   ``And many children who are at home do not get the amount of
ongoing supervision as a child does in a day-care center,'' he said
in a telephone interview.
   In the Atlanta study, most injuries _ 58 percent _ were caused by
falls and 68.5 percent were head injuries. The study said 54 percent
of the injuries occurred outside, and outside accidents accounted
for 76 percent of the most serious injuries.
   The high number of playground injuries could be cut with a few
simple measures, including the installation of impact-absorbing
surfaces, such as wood chips or sand, Sacks suggested.
   The researchers found that injuries were more likely to occur in
the summer than the winter; on Monday and Friday than in the middle
of the week; and between the hours of 11 a.m. and noon and 4 p.m.
and 5 p.m.
   They suggested that increased supervision during those periods
could lower injury rates.

<TEXT>
   The number of Texas bank closings this year has
tied last year's total and more failures are on the way, experts
said.
   Texas Banking Commissioner Kenneth Littlefield closed Rose
Capital Bank in Tyler on Thursday, the 113th failure this year.
   Analysts said more closings are on the way, perhaps as a slower
pace, as the industry continues to suffer from the real estate and
energy depressions.
   ``I had projected earlier in the year that we would likely have
100 independent bank failures,'' Littlefield said. He noted that the
113 include more than 44 from two large bank-holding companies.
   ``We believe that 1990 is going to show a slight increase in the
number of independently chartered banks that fail,'' Littlefield
said, predicting about 80 next year.
   ``We will continue to have bank failures for two more years'' as
a result of past lending decisions, Littlefield said.
   ``The worst is behind Texas banks,'' said Sandy Flannigan, a
Houston-based analyst for PaineWebber Inc.
   Nationally, the numbers should remain about the same next year,
according to Alan Whitney, a spokesman for the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. in Washington, D.C.
   Rose Capital was the 160th failure this year in the country, said
Whitney, who noted that 10 banks failed each year from 1979 to 1981
and ``we thought it was Armageddon.''
   Since then, the numbers have grown each year: 42 in 1982, 48 in
'83, 80 in '84, 120 in '85, 138 in '86, 184 in '87 and 200 last year.
   The failures will continue, Whitney said, ``even though the
economy in Texas and other parts of the Southwest has begun to
stabilize somewhat because changes in the banking industry always
lag from 18 months to 24 months.''
   Littlefield said Rose Capital was closed because ``asset quality
problems and resulting losses ... attributed to the area's poor
economic condition.''
   The bank, which had assets of $64.6 million and deposits of about
$61.1 million, was purchased by First City Bancorp. of Texas Inc.
for $25,000.
   First City will also purchase about $46.4 million of Rose
Capital's assets.
   The FDIC will provide $16.8 million in assistance, and retain
assets with a book value of $18.2 million. The bank was to reopen
today.

<HEAD>Most Hospitals Properly Disposing of Infectious Waste, Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While most hospitals follow uniform guidelines in
disposing of infectious medical waste, the offices of doctors,
dentists and other health care providers form a vast unregulated
source of potentially harmful waste, medical researchers say.
   The volume of medical waste produced by these other facilities
could exceed the 6,000 tons of refuse churned out daily by
hospitals, according to a report in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   The researchers said one-fourth of the states don't regulate how
clinics dispose of their waste, while in about half the states,
doctors' and dentists' offices fall outside the regulations.
   There are 278,000 private doctors' and dentists' offices, 16,400
nursing homes, and thousands of walk-in surgery centers, dialysis
centers and blood banks across the nation.
   In contrast to the lack of control over these facilities, 44
states regulate hospitals, and the survey found that 82 percent of
the hospitals responding said they complied with disposal guidelines
developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   Seventy-five percent of the hospitals in the survey complied with
waste disposal guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, which has a broader classification of infectious waste than
the CDC.
   ``I think it's generally good news that the vast majority of
hospitals are in compliance with the CDC and EPA recommendations,''
said Dr. William Rutala, administrative director of the Department
of Hospital Epidemiology of North Carolina Memorial Hospital in
Chapel Hill. ``I believe it indicates the seriousness with which
hospitals manage their medical waste.''
   Rutala led the team of researchers who compiled the study.
   He said that even in cases of non-compliance, no hospital could
identify an infection problem, excluding needle-stick injuries, that
was attributable to the disposal of infectious waste.
   Problems relating to medical waste disposal have come to public
attention due to concerns about the spread of the AIDS virus and
several highly publicized incidents. In August 1987, several hundred
tons of garbage _ including syringes and other medical waste _
washed ashore on New Jersey beaches.
   The researchers said that, at a minimum, ``the EPA should
spearhead a coordinated and consistent interstate approach to
infectious waste management.''
   Rutala said the survey data came from questionnaires sent in July
1987 and January 1988 to 441 randomly selected hospitals in 48
states.
   Infectious waste accounts for 15 percent of the total hospital
waste, the study said. The American Hospital Association estimates
that U.S. hospitals spend as much as $466 million per year to
dispose of such waste.

   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5795 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5805 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $364.00 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $363.25. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $364.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $364.00 compared with $363.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 26 cents to close at a bid

   An explosion rocked the Royal Marines School of
Music in a southeastern coastal town today, causing one building to
collapse and killing eight people, officials said. Thirty people
were injured and up to 18 were missing and feared trapped in the
rubble.
   The blast occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks
near Deal, about 70 miles southeast of London, the Defense Ministry
said.
   ``The building has collapsed,'' said a ministry spokesman,
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   ``We've no idea of the cause of the blast at the moment. It is
too early to tell.''
   Scotland Yard said a forensic team from its anti-terrorist squad
had been called in to help investigate.
   Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to
search for those trapped in the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade
spokesman Kevin Simmons.
   Kent police said 17 or 18 people were trapped. The Defense
Ministry said seven were missing.
   Ten doctors gave emergency treatment at the scene and 11
ambulances took the injured to two hospitals, the ambulance service
said.
   ``They are suffering from flash burns to their head and arms,
fractures, and the sort of injuries you would expect after an
explosion,'' said a spokesman for Buckland Hospital in Dover, 20
miles south of Deal.
   South Eastern British Gas sent investigators to the scene but
said there was nothing to indicate the explosion was caused by a gas
leak. Gas supplies to the barracks were cut as a precautionary
measure, a spokesman said.
   Guy Platts, who owns a bookstore in Deal, located 20 miles north
of the English Channel port of Dover, said he heard a ``massive
explosion. ... There are dozens of ambulances, police and fire
brigade making their way there.''
   Military targets on the British mainland have been attacked
several times by the Irish Republican Army in the past year as part
of its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.
   One soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA attack on an
army barracks in north London in August 1988. About 60 soldiers
narrowly escaped death or injury in February when they were
evacuated from their barracks in Shropshire, western England, just
before a bomb exploded.
   In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the
Household Cavalry barracks at Knightsbridge in central London and at
a bandstand in the capital's Regent's Park where an army band was
playing. Three people died later and a total of 51 were injured in
the bombings.

   Amid the uproar of live coverage by the
major networks and scores of other media organizations, National
Hurricane Center forecasters went about their business of monitoring
Hurricane Hugo.
   ``The whole system looks chaotic, but it works,'' said Bob
Sheets, the center's director.
   On one side of a large room dominated by a U-shaped bank of
monitoring equipment were the forecasters, making meticulous
calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and
getting emergency operations going in those areas.
   On the other side were the media _ a pack of reporters, camera
operators and technicians, jockeying for seconds of Sheets' time and
tidbits of his expertise.
   In the center was Sheets himself. Surrounded by cameras, wires
and two dozen journalists with pads and telephones, the ubiquitous
red-headed meteorologist has appeared on television all week next to
a large satellite monitor showing colorful images of Hurricane Hugo.
   During prime news time, competing technicians and cameramen shout
and make rude hand gestures for people to get out of their shots of
Sheets.
   At his back, casually dressed forecasters who have been working
12-hour days tracked the storm via computers and satellites.
   ``We obviously don't like this and could probably do a better
job, but everyone knows now because of the media,'' said hurricane
specialist Max Mayfield. ``In the Caribbean, we were not so certain
the word got out. But we know the Carolinas have been evacuated.''
   When a hurricane warning goes into effect, ``It's a $50 million
statement,'' said meteorologist Joel Cline, referring to the cost of
emergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implemented
when the warning is posted.
   ``If we weren't here, then you wouldn't know that a storm was out
there,'' he said. Before the hurricane warning system was
established, a storm of Hugo's power would have cost thousands of
lives. But early today, after days of warnings and proper evacuation
procedures, there were no immediate reports of deaths despite
widespread damage in Charleston and other coastal areas of South
Carolina.
   ``I like to think that we make a difference a far as human lives
are concerned,'' Cline said.
   After Hugo's landfall, Sheets and the other forecasters began to
wind down from the hectic pace they had maintained for the last
several days. But, he warned, the hurricane center still is
following three other weather systems that have moved into the
Atlantic between the United States and Africa, and another storm in
the Pacific.
   ``I hate to say we're breathing a sigh of relief because people
are getting clobbered to death,'' meteorologist Mark Zimmer said as
the storm pounded Charleston, S.C. ``But we've done all we can.''

   Refugees from the violent suppression of China's
pro-democracy movement today began the first meeting of a new
opposition party in exile.
   European politicians and artists were among about 500 people
attending the three-day meeting of the Federation for Democracy in
China, held at Sorbonne University.
   Participants observed a moment of silence to honor pro-democracy
demonstrators who died June 3-4 when soldiers marched on Beijing to
crush the student-led movement. Hundreds, and perhaps thousands,
were killed.
   ``No one will think of freedom or democracy or remember 1989
without recalling the courage and strength shown by those people on
Tiananmen Square,'' said Paddy Ashdown of Britain's Liberal
Democratic Party, referring to the central Beijing square where
students staged pro-democracy protests.
   ``What you have done has been an inspiration to us. What you will
do is a hope for the future,'' the lawmaker said.
   Among those in the crowd were photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson
and actor Yves Montand, who told reporters he came to support the
battle for human rights.
   ``But how can they in exile?'' he said. ``The answer is like
this. This is the first chapter.''
   During the meeting, prominent Chinese exiles _ including former
Communist Party members, artists, intellectuals, students and
businesspeople _ plan to establish rules for the federation. A main
office in Paris will have branches in North America and Asia.
   Many of those involved say the federation could serve as the
basis for an effective opposition party to Communist rule in China
if conditions ever permit the exiles to go home.
   Wan Runan, China's most influential independent business
executive until the violent suppression of the pro-democracy
movement June 3-4, predicted the exiles will go home within 10 years.
   ``We have a large number of elites among us with lots of
influence in China. We also have millions of overseas Chinese who
are uniting to support the movement,'' he said.
   ``We can make a great impact on developments in China even though
we are in exile. We've left our traces in the system. The second we
raise any issue there will be a lot of followers back home,'' Wan
said.
   The federation hopes to mobilize more than 35 million Chinese
living in Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States and elsewhere to keep
pressure on authorities in Beijing for economic and political reform.
   ``Just as a company who desires success must satisfy its
customers, so any political organization has to satisfy its people.
In this belief we certainly have support,'' said Wan, who formerly
led the Beijing Stone Group computer company.
   The company was a model for many of the quasi-independent
companies set up under an economic reform program that has been in
trouble since last fall when the government announced austerity
measures to combat inflation and excessive growth.
   The federation will push for international economic sanctions to
intensify China's economic difficulties and with that force the
government toward political change.
   Chen Yizi, an influential adviser to ousted Communist Party
leader Zhao Ziyang and the most senior official known to have
escaped to the West after the crackdown, said economic conditions in
the country continue to deteriorate.
   He said inflation in the first six months of the year ran at an
annual rate of 35 percent in the biggest cities and 28 percent
nationwide.
   As China moves away from an economy that responds to market
forces and back to centralized control, wages will suffer, Chen said.
   During the decade that Chen headed China's Institute for Economic
Structural Reform, one of three influential think tanks, per capita
wages rose 260 percent for peasants and 70 percent for urban workers.
   He predicted that under a return to centralized economy policies,
China's gross national product would decline and consumer goods
would become scarce.
   ``There is and will continue to be widespread dissatisfaction,''
Chen said. ``The next decade will see fundamental changes in China.
Within 20 years we will have a firmly established democratic
process. And this federation will play a key role in that.''

<TEXT>
   Gay rights activists and other longtime backers of
U.S. Rep. Barney Frank gathered in Boston to support the embattled
congressman in the face of an investigation into his involvement
with a male prostitute.
   A joint statement issued Thursday by the 13 local and national
groups endorsed Frank, arguing that the congressman has been
unfairly tarnished because he is gay. Similar scandals involving
heterosexuals have been much shorter lived in the news media, the
groups claimed.
   ``Much of the discussion of this matter has centered on Barney's
acknowledged homosexuality,'' said Steven Tierney, co-chairman of
the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, who read the
joint statement.
   The groups endorsing Frank included the National Organization for
Women, the Massachusetts Women's Caucus, the Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders and the AIDS Action Committee.
   They said Frank is entitled to a fair hearing before the House
ethics committee.
   ``Congressman Frank welcomes expressions of support,'' said Doug
Cahn, a spokesman for Frank.
   Several Frank supporters said that Frank's behavior in his
acknowledged affair with male prostitute Stephen L. Gobie and his
admitted solicitation of other male prostitutes had to be weighed
against his record in Congress.
   ``This happened two to four years ago,'' said Robert Wheatley, a
retired Unitarian Universalist minister. ``Barney has already gotten
his act together. He was honest and forthright and he said he made a
mistake.''

<HEAD>Rocky Flats Operator Sues Government Over Waste Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDY SHORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp. is suing the
government, claiming conflicting federal rules require it to violate
hazardous waste disposal laws at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant.
   ``We have taken today's action only because we are caught in the
middle of an intergovernmental feud for which no satisfactory
resolution has been found,'' Donald R. Beall, Rockwell chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a news release issued Thursday in
Denver, after the suit was filed.
   The lawsuit, which names the government, the Justice Department,
the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency,
asks the court to clarify the obligations of Rockwell and the
government in the operation of the plant.
   Rockwell operates the plant 16 miles northwest of Denver under a
contract with DOE. Rocky Flats produces plutonium triggers for
nuclear weapons and employs about 6,000 workers.
   The Rockwell lawsuit focuses on plutonium recovery operations,
the application of land disposal restrictions to mixed wastes and
the handling of recycled water.
   DOE spokesman Ben McCarty, based at Rocky Flats, said the agency
was surprised by the lawsuit, but declined to comment further. EPA
spokesman Nat Miullo in Denver also declined to comment.
   The civil lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington,
D.C., is the latest development in an ongoing series of problems at
the weapons plant involving disposal of hazardous wastes.
   In June, federal agents raided the plant as part of an
investigation into allegations of illegal hazardous waste disposal.
A special federal grand jury is considering evidence in that case,
but has issued no indictments.
   Federal law prohibits storage of hazardous wastes at a production
site for more than 90 days, but there is no federally approved
disposal site or treatment process for Rocky Flats' wastes.
   Rockwell has been stockpiling wastes at Rocky Flats since Idaho
Gov. Cecil Andrus refused to accept further shipments bound for a
temporary storage dump in Idaho earlier this year. The government
plans to open an underground repository near Carlsbad, N.M., but
that has been delayed pending further studies.
   On Friday, Rockwell threatened to close the plant unless
hazardous waste regulations were clarified, citing a concern over
the potential for criminal prosecution. Later that day, DOE, EPA and
state officials announced a plan to resolve the problems over the
next year.
   But Beall said assurances that the company won't face criminal
prosecution because of the regulation conflicts ``are insufficient,
considering the investigations already under way.''
   As an example of the conflicting regulations, Rockwell cited the
plutonium residues which are stored at the plant for recycling and
reuse under DOE rules. But the lawsuit said the Justice Department
and EPA claim the residues actually are wastes which are stored
illegally under EPA rules.

<HEAD>Azerbaijani Blockade Prevents Armenian Newspapers from Publishing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armenian newspapers couldn't publish their latest
editions because a blockade by the neighboring republic of
Azerbaijan has cut off their supply of paper, the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda reported today.
   The newspapers printed Thursday in the Armenian capital, Yerevan,
would have carried major news: the shake-up in the Communist Party's
ruling Politburo that replaced conservatives with key players in the
reform programs of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Pravda denounced the Azerbaijani action, saying: ``It is
difficult to believe that in our socialist government, one of the
union republics could find itself in an encircling economic
blockade.''
   Soviet press accounts earlier blamed the cutoff in freight
shipments to Armenia on striking Azerbaijani railway workers.
   More than 100 people have died in ethnic violence in the southern
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan in the past 19 months, mosly
because of a territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely
Armenian area within Azerbaijan.
   The main rail and road routes to Armenia pass through Azerbaijan,
and Pravda said today those routes remain closed. Even basic
foodstuffs such as pasta and rice have disappeared in Yerevan, it
said.
   ``The workers of the republic are finding themselves unwilling
strikers,'' because their factories have been forced to shut down
for lack of raw materials, Pravda said.
   Even the print shop of Armenia's Communist Party Central
Committee has not received a shipment of newsprint since Aug. 26,
the labor newspaper Trud said.
   Pravda said restoration in the area of Armenia devastated by last
year's earthquake has halted and that a team of Norwegians was
preparing to give up its construction of a 200-bed hospital and go
home because it has been waiting for their supplies for months.
   On Thursday evening, more than 100 Armenians in Moscow broke the
ban on demonstrations on Red Square to protest being driven from
their homes in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
   Witnesses said Moscow police cordoned off the vast square
adjacent to the Kremlin, preventing other Armenians from joining the
protest and keeping foreign and Soviet tourists from the area. It
was not clear if the police forced the demonstrators to leave.

   A relative of a movie executive
testified she was thrown against a car and jailed by the same
policeman who arrested Zsa Zsa Gabor for driving with expired auto
license tags.
   ``I thought he was going to kill me,'' defense witness Melanie
Jonkers said Thursday during the ninth day of Miss Gabor's criminal
cop-slapping trial. She frequently broke into tears while recalling
the alleged confrontation with officer Paul Kramer.
   ``He grabbed my arm, threw me across the trunk of the car and
handcuffed me,'' said Mrs. Jonkers, the sister-in-law of Orion
Pictures chief Michael Medavoy.
   Mrs. Jonkers, who lives with her husband and 2{-year-old daughter
in Arlington, Va., had been pulled over by Kramer last on Oct. 13
because her child wasn't strapped in a car seat as required by state
law.
   ``It was so unnecessary,'' she said of the encounter, ``and my
daughter is still suffering from it. ... Every time she hears
sirens, she says, `Is that the mean man coming to take mommy away?'
''
   Before she was arrested by Kramer, Mrs. Jonkers testified that
she desperately tried to flag down a passing car for help. Defense
lawyer William Graysen asked what she wanted a passing motorist to
do.
   ``For them to call the police,'' she said.
   Mrs. Jonkers hired a lawyer to file suit against Kramer, but the
attorney said it would be a difficult case because ``you can't fight
city hall.'' She came forward after hearing of the Gabor case, she
said, ``because officer Kramer is still harassing people.''
   The testimony was a departure from the often-frivolous answers by
Miss Gabor, who concluded her third day on the stand Thursday.
   Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox replayed for jurors a
videotape showing Miss Gabor using foul language during a phone call
from the city jail.
   After repeated questioning about her cursing, Miss Gabor said:
``Mr. Fox, I'm an old lady. When I'm hit by a 6-foot-6 cop with a
gun ... Mr. Kramer used every (expletive) word there is. ... I said
the word because I learned it from your wonderful police
department.''
   During the lunch recess, Miss Gabor said she was relieved to have
finished her testimony, saying, ``This is not Nazi Germany, but this
trial sounds like it.'' She cried during Mrs. Jonkers' recollection
of the October arrest.
   Miss Gabor faces a possible 18-month jail sentence if convicted
of misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's
orders, driving with an expired license and having an open container
of alcohol (a flask of Jack Daniels whiskey in the glove
compartment) in her car.
   Miss Gabor doesn't deny slapping Kramer, but insists she lashed
out in self-defense after the motorcycle officer cursed her and
dragged her from her Rolls-Royce on June 14 when he spotted expired
registration tags on the car.
   Graysen said he expects to complete his case by Monday and
expects jury deliberations to begin Tuesday.

<HEAD>Glemp Gives Written Agreement to Moving Auschwitz Convent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   British Jewish officials today welcomed a letter
from Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the primate of Poland, in which he
changed his position on a disputed convent at Auschwitz and said it
should be moved.
   The letter appeared to reflect a radical change of heart on
Glemp's part.
   He wrote that he now realized that ``the shrill voices'' and
``aggression'' in the campaign against the convent at the Nazi death
camp in southern Poland did not represent world Jewry.
   ``Auschwitz should never be a place of controversy,'' Glemp's
letter said.
   On Tuesday, tha Vatican issued a statement saying the convent
should be moved.
   The primate had opposed moving the convent despite an agreement
between Catholic cardinals and Jewish leaders that the Carmelite
nuns would moved to an interfaith cultural center to be built
further away from the site of the camp.
   The letter was made public by Sir Sigmund Sternberg, a
philanthropist who heads the International Council of Christians and
Jews. Glemp handed the letter to Sternberg at a dinner at the Polish
Embassy in London on Tuesday.
   It said: ``It is essential not only to move the convent outside
the perimeter of the site, but also to set up the new cultural
center.''
   Asked if this meant an end to the controversy, Hayim Pinner,
secretary general of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said:
``It doesn't put an end to it. The controversy will be at end when
the convent is moved as promised by the agreement,'' signed in
Geneva in 1987.
   But Pinner told The Associated Press the letter ``shows a better
understanding on the part of those who so far have not been ready to
implement the agreement. It's progress, and we hope that it will now
be implemented.''
   Shimon Cohen, a spokesman for the chief rabbi of Britain, Lord
Immanuel Jakobovits, said the letter ``will undoubtedly be a
substantial contribution to restoring Catholic-Jewish harmony.''
   The convent has angered many Jews who suspect the Catholic church
of trying to insert itself into what they regard as a Jewish
catastrophe. Of the 4 million who died at Auschwitz, 2.5 million
were Jews.
   The Geneva agreement said the convent should be moved by Feb. 22
this year. But the deadline passed, and last month the archbishop of
Krakow, Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, said the church was
abrogating the accord because it could not be implemented in an
atmosphere of aggressive demands.
   Glemp has steadfastly defended the nuns' right to choose their
own course of action, and his recent pronouncements on the issue
have included remarks that many interpreted as anti-Semitic.
   Glemp arrived in Britain on Tuesday to consecrate a Polish
Catholic church on the same day the Vatican came out in support of
building the interfaith center and offered financing.
   ``There has been a great deal of ill feelings and
misunderstanding which we would like to clear up,'' Glemp's letter
said. It referred to a letter to Sternberg from Polish Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki which acknowledged the uniqueness of the
Jewish experience under the Nazis.
   Referring to Sternberg's intercession, Glemp wrote: ``Until you
sent your messages I was unaware of the moderating voices, therefore
I was glad that some of the shrill voices do not reflect the
feelings of world Jewry and aggression is not part of Jewish
philosophy.''
   Mazowiecki's letter invited Sternberg to Poland, and Glemp said
he would then ``be pleased to meet you and discuss with you the
speedy implementation of the Geneva Declaration.''

   Rifle-toting U.S.
troops patrolled St. Croix to restore order after Hurricane Hugo
brought chaos to the island. Officials said it appeared the troops
had curbed rampant looting.
   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``The troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the looting
and other lawlessness associated with the destruction. It is
impossible to say at this point how long they will have to be
there.''
   It appeared that most stores had been cleaned out before the
troops began arriving Thursday. One local official defended the
looters as desperate people left homeless and hungry by Hugo's
devastation Sunday.
   The storm struck the U.S. mainland late Thursday, blasting South
Carolina with 135 mph winds and leveling dozens of buildings. It was
downgraded to a tropical storm this morning with winds of 70 mph and
was expected to weaken further as it moved northward up the East
Coast.
   The Marine Radio Band, monitored on nearby St. Thomas, said
Thursday that two looters were shot in St. Croix, but there was no
word of their condition or independent confirmation. Officials said
some looters were local National Guardsmen.
   Sixty FBI agents, 50 federal marshals and 150 soldiers of the
18th Airborne Corps from Fort Bragg, N.C., arrived Thursday with
orders from President Bush to restore calm to the popular vacation
spot.
   The rest of the 1,200-person Fort Bragg unit, composed mostly of
military police, was due to be in place by today, said Lt. Col. Ned
Longsworth, the unit's spokesman. ``We are authorized to make
arrests only in the total absence of local authorities,'' he said.
   The troops are the first active duty military personnel sent onto
the nation's streets in 20 years. Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in Washington they were ordered to
shoot if necessary to defend themselves.
   A Navy destroyer was anchored off Christiansted, St. Croix's
biggest city on the northern coast, and two Coast Guard cutters were
off Frederiksted on the southern coast.
   U.S. Army C-141 transport planes flew in and out of the airport
while Coast Guard helicopters buzzed over the two towns, where most
of the island's of 55,000 people live.
   Hurricane Hugo left at least 26 people dead in the Caribbean. The
storm was responsible for at least one death on St. Croix, where it
destroyed or severely damaged most homes on the island, 70 miles
east of Puerto Rico.
   Bush on Thursday declared the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
federal disaster areas, making them eligible for emergency relief
money.
   Roads were littered with debris in Christiansted, where hundreds
of people lined up Thursday behind water tank trucks with buckets
and jugs. Others siphoned gasoline from wrecked service stations.
The island still lacked power, water and telephone service.
   The looting that followed the storm caused panic and fear among
tourists, and many residents armed themselves.
   Chief Warrant Officer Layton Timmons of the Virgin Islands
National Guard acknowledged that there were isolated cases of
looting by Guardsmen that had been videotaped by the Coast Guard.
   ``When two people start looting, the whole Guard gets the rap,''
he said.
   Witnesses said much of the sacking of supermarkets was done by
desperate families living in a disaster zone.
   ``We have 90 percent of the island destroyed,'' said territorial
Sen. Holland Redfield. ``People just need food. They're panicked.
It's a reaction of survival.''
   Redfield said that in many cases supermarkets gave people
permission to take the food since it was spoiling. He said only a
few of the looters were hard-core criminals.
   The few businesses that were not looted were protected by their
armed owners. A sign on the door of a Christiansted lawyer's office
read: ``I don't have any light but I have a gun.''
   ``They (the soldiers) are here, thank God,'' said Carol Rubis,
owner of a sporting goods store called Inside Track. ``For people
like myself who own a store, they came three days too late.''
   She said looters just laughed at her and continued carting away
her merchandise when she ordered them to leave.
   At Laraine Shopping Center, an auto repairman who identified
himself only as Max, 31, was sifting through the ruins of a Kenny
Shoe store with his young son. ``We saw all the shoes here. I came
to see if I could get a pair,'' he said, holding three pairs of
children's shoes.

<HEAD>Governor Plans King Bill-Signing Celebration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rose Mofford plans a bill-signing celebration
to enact a state workers' holiday in honor of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   The Arizona Senate voted 17-11, followed by a 37-21 vote in the
House, to swap state employees' paid Columbus Day holiday for the
paid King Day.
   The voting Thursday ended years of disappointment for backers of
a King holiday. Mrs. Mofford's signature will cap a struggle that
began in 1975 for King supporters.
   ``I'm delighted,'' the Democratic governor said, adding that she
planned to sign the bill soon in the state Capitol rotunda, ``where
there is plenty of room.''
   The holiday became a national issue after former Gov. Evan Mecham
revoked an executive order by his predecessor, Gov. Bruce Babbitt,
which some said enacted the holiday illegally.
   The uproar that ensued included protest marches, tourist boycotts
and convention cancellations by national organizations. Arizona is
one of only four states in the nation which does not have a King
holiday.
   Boosters said Arizona already has lost $256 million in convention
and tourism business because it has no paid King holiday and that
the state could lose $200 million in business if its bid for the
1993 Super Bowl is rejected.

   President Bush's spokesman today defended the
luring of a drug dealer to the park across from the White House so
the president could show crack cocaine on television and say it was
bought there.
   ``That was the whole point'' of the sting operation by the Drug
Enforcement Administration, said presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   ``We told the DEA we wanted to show that crack could be easily
obtained in any neighborhood in Washington, not just in the
ghetto,'' Fitzwater said.
   He claimed there was nothing wrong in luring the dealer into the
park so undercover agents could make the ``buy'' of crack cocaine
there, and that it did not consistute entrapment. The area,
Lafayette Park, is not known for drug activity.
   William McMullan, assistant agent in charge of the DEA's
Washington field office, was quoted in today's editions of The
Washington Post as saying, ``We were going to make that undercover
buy anyway. What difference does it make where it happened _ whether
it was in front of the White House ... or in front of the Supreme
Court?''
   The suspect, who still hasn't been arrested, already had sold
crack to DEA agents on other occasions elsewhere in Washington and
the buy in Lafayette Park was viewed as an installment toward a
larger buy, White House officials have said.
   Fitzwater said the administration had not sought to hide the fact
that the DEA set up the ``sting'' at the behest of the White House,
noting that he and other White House officials had discussed the
operation publicly at the time of Bush's Sept. 5 speech to the
nation.
   ``We wanted to do a government sting. We said we wanted to make a
buy in front of the White House. The DEA said, `no problem',''
Fitzwater said today.
   ``There was no deception involved. The DEA does these kinds of
stings all the time. That's how they make most of their drug
arrests.''
   Reached at home by The Associated Press, McMullan, the DEA
official, declined to discuss the matter. ``I'm not going to tell
you anything until I read the article,'' he said.
   Agency headquarters spokesman Frank Shults said, however, that
locations of drug buys are ``highly negotiable between the buyer and
seller.''
   ``That vicinity was as logical as any other location,'' he said.
   The sale of three ounces of crack to an undercover agent was made
at 11:30 a.m. on Sept. 1, four days before Bush held up a plastic
bag of the substance and told television viewers, ``This is crack
cocaine. It was seized a few days ago in a park across the street
from the White House.''
   According to the newspaper, the White House asked the Justice
Department if it could provide some cocaine for the president's
speech; Justice asked DEA and McMullan was asked if he could move a
planned purchase ``four or five blocks away'' closer to the White
House.
   A planned arrest of the suspect this week fell through when he
failed to show up for a meeting with an agent, and DEA hopes to
obtain indictments against him next week, the newspaper said.
   ``It wasn't easy'' to change the location, McMullan was quoted as
saying. At first the suspect seemed not to know what or where the
White House was. Told it was the president's house, he said, ``Oh,
you mean where Reagan lives.''

<HEAD>France Denies Receiving Warning of Plane Bombing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today denied it had received reports
warning of terrorist attacks on French interests in the days before
the crash of a French DC-10 en route from Chad to Paris.
   The UTA flight with 171 people aboard blew apart Tuesday over the
West African country of Niger, leaving no survivors.
   The Lebanese extremist group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility
in separate telephone calls in London and Paris, although officials
said they could not authenticate the claim.
   French officials say they have not ruled out an accidental cause
for the explosion but that a bomb was the most likely explanation.
   A spokesman for President Francois Mitterrand, speaking on
condition of anonymity in keeping with government practice, said a
thorough check had shown ``none of our services, none of our
ministries, received either threats or intelligence about
preparations for anti-French attacks.''
   Foreign Ministry officials said the statement was a reponse to an
article in today's edition of the weekly L'Express, which said
France's Embassy in Beirut had reported urgently on an article in
the Lebanese weekly Ash-Shiraa reporting on possible terrorist
attacks.
   L'Express said Ash-Shiraa reported the people who had held French
hostages in Beirut last year were complaining that the French
government had not kept promises allegedly made to win their release.
   France has repeatedly denied making any deal for the hostages,
beyond agreeing to restore diplomatic relations with Iran. The
French dispute recurrent reports that they agreed to free Anis
Naccache, a pro-Iranian Lebanese serving a life sentence for the
attempted murder in 1980 of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour
Bakhtiar in France.
   A Foreign Ministry official, who demanded anonymity, confirmed
that the French Embassy in Beirut sent copies of the Ash-Shiraa
article to Paris.
   ``All our embassies send us such reports regularly,'' he said.
``The content of the article is extremely vague. You couldn't draw
the conclusion from it that there would be an attack on a UTA plane
en route from N'Djamena to Paris.''
   Ash-Shiraa is known for breaking the story of arms deals between
the United States and Iran, but since then many of its articles
relating to Western hostages held in Iran have not proved correct.
   French officials have said they will wait for the results of an
inquiry before concluding whether the plane was bombed.
   UTA, or Union des Transports Aeriens, said it received an
anonymous telephone call about midnight Tuesday, before the downed
aircraft had been located by a French military plane, saying Islamic
Jihad was responsible.
   An anonymous caller to a Western news agency in London also said
Islamic Jihad was responsible and demanded the release of Shiite
Moslem religious leader Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, who was kidnapped
from southern Lebanon on July 28 by Israeli forces.
   Islamic Jihad is among several radical fundamentalist groups in
Lebanon believed to be part of Hezbollah, or Party of God, the
umbrella group thought to hold 16 Westerners hostage in Lebanon.
Obeid is a member of Hezbollah.
   The hostages include eight Americans. The longest held is Terry
A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   In N'Djamena, the Chadian capital where French authorities are
directing the search effort, Col. Jean-Pierre Job told reporters
today that flight and voice recorders had been found and were being
sent back to Paris for study.
   Job said the searchers had recovered about 60 bodies to be flown
out by helicopter. They are to be flown to France for
identification, the Foreign Ministry said. In Niamey, the capital of
Niger, a plane carrying coffins arrived this morning.
   French paratroopers and military doctors were working under
severe conditions, with temperatures up to 113 degrees, and
officials said they expected it to be difficult to identify all of
the bodies.

   The American Indian Dance Theater, its 23 dancers
and musicians coming from 17 tribes, is presenting a fascinating
two-hour show, through Oct. 1, at the Joyce Theater.
   The 15 dances, seen Thursday night, are said to be authentic,
traditional Indian dances, staged by Hanay Geiogamah, a member of
the Kiowa-Delaware tribes from Oklahoma, and Raoul Trujillo.
   One can enjoy them as dance or study them more deeply for
meaning. An explanation of each dance is written in the program.
   ``Hoop Dance,'' a solo by Eddie Swimmer, a Cherokee from North
Carolina, is remarkable. While dancing, he picks up thin metal hoops
and puts them around his body, knees and arms, at various angles,
until he looks like a man inside a cage. Notes say he has danced
with 42 hoops.
   Six men with eagle wings down their arms performed ``Eagle
Dance.'' As they walked through steam, they seemed to be soaring
over clouds. In a second version, as danced in another region, they
would squat and stand, again seeming to fly.
   Many of the dances had face paint, elaborate costumes in sunburst
colors, much fringe and headdresses. Dance steps were often a step
and hesitation or step and hop. Our interest was held less by the
costumes than on the countless, interesting variations of movement.
   In ``Buffalo Dance,'' Fabian Fontenelle, from the Zuni Pueblo in
New Mexico, who also plays drums with a rock group, Satschal's, and
Morgan Tosee, a member of the Comanche Tribe, had fur-covered heads.
They were kept in line by Lavina Colwash, of the Yakima Tribe and
Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, Ore., and Cassie Soldierwolf,
from the Northern Arapahoe Tribe in Wyoming. Sometimes the buffalo
escaped the young women to butt their heads together.
   We also liked ``Drum Call'' by Wade Baker of the Hidatsa-Cree
tribes from North Dakota and Joe Bellanger, member of the Chippewa
Tribe, Red Lake Band, from Minnesota. The drumming was both a
challenge, like old-time jazz cutting contests, and a duet.
   The troupe was founded in 1987 by concert producer Barbara
Schwei, to develop greater awareness of American Indian dances,
dances done by many tribes and dances unique to specific tribes.
   A ``Dance in America'' PBS special has been taped, for airing in
February.
   A tour, beginning Oct. 10, takes the company to Calgary, Canada;
Billings and Helena, Mont.; Spokane, Tacoma and Bellingham, Wash.;
San Diego, Riverside and Los Angeles, Calif.; Tucson; Moorhead and
Minneapolis, Minn.; Indianapolis; Des Moines; Dayton; Skokie,
Springfield and Chicago, Ill.; Interlochen and East Lansing, Mich.
Then the company tours for six weeks in Europe.

   Hurricane Hugo spared North
Carolina a direct hit but its still-powerful remnants slashed the
state with pelting rains and high winds today, kiling at least one
and leaving 85 percent of Charlotte without power.
   ``The weather here is terrible,'' said Alleghany County Deputy
Sheriff Tim Blevins. ``It's raining so hard you can't see your hand
in front of you. The main arteries into town are either full of
water or full of trees.''
   Coastal residents _ who braced through the night for possible
hurricane-force winds _ awoke to lessening rains. But people in the
region around Charlotte, 200 miles from the coast, were battered by
wind and rain as the center of the storm passed over at 5 a.m.
   About 175 National Guardsmen were sent to locations around the
state to assist local authorities.
   A 6-month-old infant in Union County was killed when a tree fell
on a house and crashed into the baby's crib, said state emergency
management spokesman Jeff Merritt.
   The National Weather Service issued a flood warning in Alleghany
County, where police said parts of Routes 18 and 21 were under
water. Officials said streams were expected to leave their banks.
   High winds toppled a transmission tower at WSOC in Charlotte, and
windows on the 42-story First Union office building were blown out.
   Winds clocked at 75 mph were reported at Charlotte Douglas
International Airport. A gust to 90 mph prompted evacuation of the
FAA control tower at 4:15 a.m.
   Duke Power spokeswoman Anne Sheffield said ``extremely high winds
and heavy rains'' knocked down power lines in the city. She said
there was no way to know immediately what effects were in Duke's
service area outside Charlotte.
   About 200,000 of the utility's 235,000 customers in Charlotte
were without power.
   ``Our chief concern right now is safety,'' she said. ``People
need to stay at home to begin with, and when the storm subsides we
strongly advise them to stay away from any downed power lines. We're
asking for customer patience today.''
   The state emergency management office said 5 to 10 inches of rain
were forecast for 100 miles on either side of the storm's track.
   Windows were blown out of First union's 42-story downtown office
building in Charlotte, said David Keathley at the Mecklenburg County
emergency operations center.
   Charlotte police Capt. J.D. Price said many city streets were
blocked by downed trees and some flood-prone areas had problems with
high water.
   A tornado watch was in effect for the southern foothills,
northern foothills and sandhills regions of North Carolina, while a
high wind warning and a flood watch were in effect for nearly the
entire state.
   In Fayetteville, the roof of a Days Inn motel blew onto cars of
people who had checked into the motel to escape the storm's wrath.

   Thousands of Cambodian troops have
been deployed to defend a strategic town against guerrilla attack, a
top officer said today, describing what could become the first major
test for his forces after Vietnam's pullout.
   Up to 450 Khmer Rouge guerrillas based in Thailand and aiming to
carve out a ``liberated zone'' have intensified mortar shelling of
Pailin, sometimes raining 2,000 rounds a day on the area, according
to the deputy defense minister, Gen. Ke Kim Yan.
   A confrontation between government forces and guerrillas in the
mountainous area that includes Pailin will test whether the
Cambodian army can defend the country without help from Vietnam.
   ``We will not let the enemy occupy any territory as a liberated
zone,'' he told reporters. On Thursday, Vietnam began what it called
the pullout of its last 26,000 troops.
   ``We are mobilizing all our men so we will not lose Pailin,'' he
said.
   Thousands more soldiers began moving out today after a ceremony
in Battambang, a neighboring province boredering Thailand that
includes Pailin.
   The Soviet-backed Vietnamese, who invaded the country in 1978 and
toppled the notorious Khmer Rouge regime, have promised to withdraw
the last of their troops by Tuesday and leave the pro-Hanoi
government of President Heng Samrin to fend for itself.
   Cambodia's army of an estimated 50,000 regulars and 60,000 to
80,000 poorly trained militia members will then face a resistance
coalition of roughly 50,000 guerrillas.
   ``We still stay in Pailin; that means the Khmer Rouge cannot do
anything to Cambodia,'' Ke Kim Yan said.
   A Foreign Ministry official said Friday that Pailin town was
shelled when he and a foreign journalist visited there a few days
ago. On the road, shells also struck a few feet behind an armored
personnel carrier in their convoy, he said on condition of anonymity.
   The Vietnamese troops are to cross into southern Vietnam on
Tuesday by air, land, sea and river, ending Vietnam's involvement in
a war that cost it the lives of more than 25,000 soldiers,
international isolation and economic stagnation.
   The three guerrilla groups trying to topple the government
Vietnam installed in Phnom Penh say they do not believe Vietnam
intends to withdraw its troops. Still, they have been launching new
attacks in areas bordering Thailand to take advantage of it, said
many officials.
   Many Western analysts say Phnom Penh's army could have problems
fighting the guerrillas alone. The Khmer Rouge, the largest
guerrilla group, has decades of battle experience.
   However, Ke Kim Yan said: ``The Vietnamese army ... helped the
Cambodian army very much in gaining experience. We are now
experienced enough to deal with guerrilla warfare.''
   The general said the Khmer Rouge began attacking the Pailin area
in July from two bases in Thailand's border province of Trat.
   ``If you capture Pailin, you gain not only in military but
economic strategy,'' Ke Kim Yan said.
   ``It would be easy for them to get their military supplies in
from bases in Trat province. It is a mountainous and forested area
so you can hide your men there. And there are rubies so you can get
money to feed all your men,'' he said.
   The general said his forces have suffered few casualties at
Pailin except for some troops who stepped on the increasing number
of guerrilla-planted land mines
   Fighting in other parts of Cambodia currently is limited to
small-scale, hit-and-run guerrilla attacks, he said.
   The Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, who took power in 1975, tried to
force an agrarian revolution on the country. During that time,
hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people died from
executions, famine and civil unrest.
   The other members of the resistance coalition are the
non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front of former
Cambodian Prime Minister Son Sann and followers of former Cambodian
head of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   In a statement issued in Beijing on Thursday and seen in Bangkok
today, Sihanouk denounced as a sham Vietnam's pledged withdrawal.
   Sihanouk also rejected a recent Thai cease-fire proposal for his
country and flatly refused to enter talks with Phnom Penh.
   However, a Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman, Prachyadavi
Tavedikul, said his country and other Southeast Asian nations still
will campaign for the Cambodian resistance coalition to retain its
seat in the United Nations as the official Cambodian government.
   The issue is expected to come up when the U.N. General Assembly
convenes in New York this month. Some dipolomats expect reduced
support for the coalition because of Vietnam's promised pullout.

   Followers of television evangelist Jim
Bakker said they were happy they paid $1,000 for partnerships in his
ministry and didn't think he belonged in court.
   Elizabeth Sacco, a former PTL employee who was laid off in 1986,
testified Thursday that she's still loyal to Bakker ``and I'm proud
of it. I feel loyalty because I've seen what this man built. A
greedy man doesn't have his hair turn gray in five years.
   ``I wouldn't have taken his job for $10 million a year.''
   Ms. Sacco, who answered correspondence for the ministry, was one
of the first witnesses to testify for Bakker as the defense phase of
the 3{-week-old fraud trial got under way. Today's session of the
trial, however, was canceled after the remnants of Hurricane Hugo
battered the city, cutting off power to most buildings and downing
trees that blocked many streets.
   Bakker is charged with overselling the $1,000 lifetime
partnerships _ which bought their owners three nights of lodging
each year for life _ and diverting $3.7 million of the proceeds to
finance his lavish lifestyle.
   If convicted of all 24 fraud and conspiracy counts, Bakker could
face 120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines.
   Prosecution witnesses had testified they had difficulty booking
rooms at PTL's Heritage USA theme park near Fort Mill, S.C. The
government alleges that Bakker sold more than twice as many
partnerships as there was room for at the park.
   James Johnson, who bought eight partnerships in Bakker's church,
said he always was able to get reservations when he called PTL, and
didn't believe the partnerships were oversold.
   ``The only regret I have is that I don't think this should have
been brought before this court,'' Johnson said. ``The church should
have taken care of it.''
   Louise Grimes, who operates a gas station in Hopkins, S.C., said
the money she sent to PTL for six partnerships was well spent.
   She said she had used the partnerships several times to book
rooms at the Heritage Grand Hotel, sometimes visiting with her
grandchildren.
   Under questioning by defense attorney George T. Davis, she
described the atmosphere at Heritage USA.
   ``I want to say it's heavenly, but I don't know what heaven is
like,'' she said. ``I can tell you that people were happy there.''
   ``It did not take a mastermind to see that Jim and Tammy were
telling the truth,'' Atlanta builder and businessman Sam Gasaway
testified, referring to Bakker and his wife. ``The purpose of the
ministry is to reach out and help people.''
   ``I found them to be upright people, truthful in what they
said,'' Gasaway said. ``They're not the kind of people who should be
accused of what they are accused of.''

   A $25,000 reward has been offered for the return
of a 3-day-old boy apparently kidnapped from his mother's hospital
room by a woman dressed as a nurse, authorities said.
   The reward was posted by Sinai Hospital after Avery James Norris
disappeared Thursday from a bassinet as his mother rested in her bed.
   ``I am deeply shaken,'' said Dr. B. Stanley Cohen, hospital
president. ``This is a matter of great concern. I'm not interested
in arrest and conviction. I'm interested in the recovery of that
baby.''
   The mother, legal secretary Linda McLaughlin Norris, 30, told
police a woman dressed in a nurse's uniform came into her room and
said a doctor would visit shortly. The woman walked Mrs. Norris to
bed, put the baby in a bassinet and drew a curtain around the bed.
   A real nurse came into the room about five minutes later and
noticed the baby missing. A maternity patient sharing the room with
Mrs. Norris told authorities she saw the woman take the baby but was
not alarmed.
   A search of the 471-bed hospital failed to turn up the infant,
born Tuesday by Caesarean section. The FBI was called in to
assistant Baltimore police.

comments, edits to trim. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former president Jose Napoleon
Duarte's condition improved today, but he remained in critical
condition, his doctor said.
   Dr. Jose Luis Saca, Duarte's personal physician, said outside
Duarte's home that the ex-president ``awakened better, without a
doubt. But it is a relative improvement, within a condition that
remains critical.''
   He said Duarte, who suffers from liver cancer, was breathing
``much better'' and that he did not need oxygen this morning. The
former president slept about two hours last night and another hour
this morning before getting out of bed to drink milk and eat some
cold cereal, Saca said.
   Duarte continues to be connected to a plasma bag by which he is
fed intravenously and medicated. Saca said he would sharply reduce
the dose of sedatives Duarte has been receiving for the past two
days.
   ``He wants to be more alert to be able to talk with his family,''
the doctor said.
   Duarte, 63, spent most of Thursday in bed, saying brief goodbyes
to friends and colleagues who visited him at his home in this
capital's affluent San Benito neighborhood.
   His wife, Ines, and the couple's six children _ four daughters
and two sons _ were at his side throughout the day.
   Duarte rose from his bed in the evening and was seated in a
wheelchair, said Dr. Jose Luis Saca, his personal physician. He said
Duarte was having great difficulty breathing and was hooked up to
oxygen most of the day.
   ``He is very critical,'' Saca said late Thursday night. ``It is a
matter of hours _ maybe 24 or 48. But the fatal denouement could
also come any minute.''
   Saca said Duarte was being fed intravenously and was heavily
sedated.
   He said Duarte's liver was carrying out ``only minimal
functions'' and that his lungs had probably been damaged by the
spreading cancer.
   Duarte, a devout Roman Catholic, received last rites early
Thursday from his confessor, Monsignor Fredy Delgado.
   President Alfredo Cristiani, a rightist inaugurated June 1 as
Duarte's successor, visited Duarte Thursday to pay his last
respects. The two men have been harsh antagonists, but Saca said
their farewell was warm and that Cristiani's visit appeared to lift
Duarte's spirits.
   His cancer was diagnosed in June 1988, with one year remaining in
his five-year term as president. He has been in critical condition
since Tuesday, when his condition deteriorated sharply while he was
attending a meeting of regional Christian Democrats in Guatemala.
   Duarte had been receiving chemotherapy periodically until last
month, when he was judged too weak to survive its debilitating
side-effects. The treatment reduced the once-stocky engineer to a
gaunt shadow of his former self.
   Imprisoned by army rulers who took over shortly after he ran for
president in 1972, Duarte left the country and returned after a 1979
coup. He joined the ruling junta in 1980 and was named president in
December of that year. He was elected president in a popular vote in
1984.
   He failed to reach a peace agreement with leftist rebels fighting
the government for the past 10 years in a war that has killed an
estimated 70,000 people, mostly civilians. Cristiani's government
has agreed to revive the peace talks.

cartels, a source at the presidential palace said today.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ms. de
Greiff's resignation would be announced later today. The official
announcement has to be made by the president, the source said.
   Security was tightened in Bogota following 12 bombs that shook
the capital.
   Radio Caracol, a usually reliable private radio network, reported
Thursday night that President Virgilio Barco accepted de Greiff's
resignation.
   The 32-year-old lawyer won praise worldwide after she traveled to
the United States in August to ask for help protecting hundreds of
judges facing death threats by cocaine traffickers.
   The traffickers have repeatedly threatened Ms. de Greiff, her
3-year-old son and husband since she took office July 16.
   They stepped up the threats when the government began cracking
down on the cocaine cartels after Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the
country's leading presidential candidate, was assassinated Aug. 18.
   Six people have served as justice minister in the past three
years and nearly all were threatened with death.
   One of Ms. de Greiff's predecessors was killed by drug lords in
1984 and another was wounded on a Budapest street in 1987 after
becoming the ambassador to Hungary.
   Radio Caracol said Barco accepted Ms. de Greiff's resignation and
offered her the ambassadorial post in Portugal but that she declined.
   The news program TV Hoy reported Arturo Ferrer Carrasco, a
44-year-old economist with the Finance Ministry, would replace Ms.
de Greiff.
   Colombia's cocaine traffickers have responded to the government's
crackdown with bombings and arson, and a new wave of explosions
rattled Bogota Thursday.
   The blasts damaged nine offices of Colombia's two main political
parties and a 10th bomb damaged a bank earlier in the day. Two
people were reported injured.
   Thursday night, blasts could be heard throughout Bogota. Police
said at least two bombs damaged a clinic, a bank, a police station
and a street. Another bomb went off near the military hospital,
injuring a young boy, police said.
   The damage was believed to be in the millions of dollars.
Hundreds of army troops, police and private security guarded
buildings across the city of 6 million people.
   The bombings came as the Colombian Senate debates allegations
that government officials and others have conspired with drug
traffickers.
   This week,the lawmakers asked the goverment to make public a list
that allegedly contains the names of government officials,
politicians, journalists and officials in the army and police
believed to be on the payroll of cartels.
   Barco said no such list exists.
   On Thursday, newspapers published the names of 25 lawmakers and
politicians recently denied visas to the United States, allegedly
because they had drug connections.
   Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes said he was asking
Washington to find out why the names were leaked.
   The U.S. Embassy said there is no special list but that thousands
of Colombians are denied tourist visas every year, many because they
plan to stay in the United States and others for suspected drug ties.
   Sen. Bernardo Guerra Serna said he was denied a U.S. visa and
blamed public statements he has made about the futility of the drug
war.
   ``This war is going to go on until we legalize drugs. Not only in
Colombia but worldwide,'' he told Colombian reporters.

   The father of track star Zola
Budd was found shot to death and was apparently murdered, police
said today.
   Frank Budd, 56, suffered two shotgun wounds to his left side
Thursday evening at his farm near the central city of Bloemfontein,
said Sgt. Marelize Visagie. She said a pickup truck and a shotgun
were missing from the house.
   Ms. Budd and her father did not communicate in recent years and
he did not attend his daughter's April 15 wedding in Bloemfontein,
saying he had not been invited.
   Budd, a retired printer, was divorced from Ms. Budd's mother and
lived alone.
   According to various reports, Ms. Budd and her father argued
frequently after she left South Africa for Britain in 1984 so she
could compete internationally.
   Ms. Budd was hurriedly granted a British passport that year so
she could compete in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
   South African athletes are barred from international competition
because of the country's apartheid policies of racial segregation.
   Ms. Budd set several distance running world records and twice won
the world cross-country championships while living and training in
Britain. But she was constantly dogged by anti-apartheid protesters
who said she should not be allowed to compete because of her South
African connections.
   Ms. Budd returned to South Africa in May 1988 and her coach John
Bryant said she was suffering from ``complete mental exhaustion.''
   When Ms. Budd married South African businessman Mike Pieterse she
indicated she would remain in her homeland indefinitely.
   Ms. Budd, 23, recently won a 10-kilometer race in Bloemfontein,
her first competition in South Africa since she went to Britain five
years ago.

<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old who admitted he killed two
women and two girls in his neighborhood was ordered to reform school
for six years, the maximum term allowable under state law.
   Craig Price waived his right to a trial Thursday and pleaded
guilty to the four slayings _ three earlier this month, the fourth
two years ago _ and the two burglaries during which the killings
occurred.
   State Attorney General James E. O'Neil, who unsuccessfully pushed
for legislation allowing juveniles under age 16 to be tried as
adults on capital charges, expressed frustration that state law
requires Price be freed at age 21.
   ``It's a crying shame that it takes a tragedy to wake ... a
community up,'' O'Neil said.
   Price admitted to police in taped confessions that he killed Joan
Heaton, 39, and her daughters Melissa, 8, and Jennifer, 10, whose
bodies were found in their home on Labor Day, said prosector Jeffrey
Pine. Price lived two blocks from the Heatons and two doors from the
house where the prosecutor said Price confessed he killed Rebecca A.
Spencer in 1987.
   Family Court Judge Carmine DePatrillo sentenced Price to the
strictest section of the Rhode Island Training School, and ordered
that he undergo psychiatric evaluations.
   Price, who smiled and nodded in the direction of a friend as he
was led into the Kent County Courthouse, stared at the table before
him as the judge explained the plea arrangement to him.
   An autopsy showed that Ms. Heaton and her daughters suffered
numerous bruises and broken bones and were stabbed repeatedly.
Spencer, who had planned to move from her home the next day, was
stabbed 58 times, police said. Her death had remained unsolved until
Price was implicated in the other three deaths.
   Investigators said the 240-pound Price, a former high school
football player known as ``Iron Man'' who was repeating the ninth
grade, never showed any remorse for the killings.

<TEXT>
   Noxell Corp., a major manufacturer of skin-care
products and cosmetics, will be merged into Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in
a $1.3 billion stock swap announced today.
   Noxell, based in Hunt Valley, Md., makes and sells Noxzema
skin-care products, Cover Girl cosmetics and Lestoil household
cleaner. The 75-year-old company has 2,200 employees, had $522
million in sales last year and markets in the United States, Canada
and Europe.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had worldwide sales of $21.4 billion last year,
making it one of the world's major consumer products companies. Its
vast array of brands includes Cheer and Tide detergents, Charmin
toilet paper, Duncan Hines baking products and Pampers disposable
diapers.
   P&amp;G said it will exchange, on a tax-free basis, 0.272 shares of
its common stock for each share of Noxell's stock. Based on
Thursday's closing price of P&amp;G stock of $121.87{, the transaction
would have a value of about $33.15 per Noxell share, company
officials said.
   Noxell soared $9.75 a share to $31 in early over-the-counter
trading today, while Procter &amp; Gamble was down $2 at $119.87{ a
share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The merger is subject to approval by Noxell Corp.'s shareholders
and federal regulators, led by the Federal Trade Commission.
Directors of both Noxell and Procter &amp; Gamble have unanimously
approved the merger, the companies said.
   The merger does not need approval by Procter &amp; Gamble
shareholders and should be completed by year's end, said P&amp;G
spokesman William Dobson. P&amp;G does not plan any immediate
significant changes, although some employees may end up being
relocated as the merger progresses, he said.

<TEXT>
   The AIDS virus has the ability to turn one of
the body's major disease fighters against the immune system itself,
leaving the patient unprotected against infection, according to a
new study.
   In a report published today in Science, Dr. Michael K. Hoffman of
the Sloan-Kettering Institute said experiments in his laboratory
show that an antibody made by the immune system to attack the AIDS
virus is turned by the virus into a weapon against the immune system
itself.
   The finding, said Hoffman, suggests that some types of vaccine
against the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS,
could actually help the disease instead of protecting the body.
   ``In terms of vaccination, our data provides some alarming news
because you would have to realize if you immunize (with a vaccine)
you also produce antibodies that might be rather harmful,'' he said.
   ``Among the antibodies that an HIV-infected individual produces,
there are some that are harmful and actually participate in the
immune system's own destruction.''
   An AIDS vaccine, Hoffman said, ``could cause exactly what you
want to prevent _ immune deficiency.''
   The principle targets of HIV are immune cells called T4
lymphocytes. The T4 is one type of white blood cell and is a key
soldier in the body's war against disease. AIDS kills by destroying
or disabling these lymphocytes, leaving the body defenseless against
infection.
   T4 lymphocytes and the AIDS virus have molecules on their
surfaces that can link, like a key in a lock. The molecule on the
lymphocyte is called CD4, and the AIDS surface molecule is called
gp120. When these molecules join, the AIDS virus is able to invade
the lymphocyte.
   In fighting against the virus invader, the body produces an
antibody, or disease-fighting molecule, that attacks the gp120
molecule.
   Hoffman said experiments in his lab show that the gp120 of the
virus actually forms what he called a ``complex'' when it joins with
the gp120 antibody and the CD4 molecule on the surface of the
lymphocyte. When this happens, he said, the lymphocyte is
inactivated and is no longer able to fight disease.
   If the finding is verified in other laboratories, Hoffman said it
would explain why even T4 lymphocytes that are not actually infected
by the AIDS virus are, nonetheless, often unable to fight disease in
a patient.
   ``That has been a mystery for a long time,'' he said. ``This
would provide a possible explanation of that.''
   Hoffman said the purpose of the study was to determine, on a
molecular level, how the immune deficiency develops in an AIDS
patient.
   ``Nobody really has the foggiest idea,'' he said. ``We think this
gives us a pretty good clue about what might be happening,'' but
more studies are needed to draw final conclusions.
   Hoffman's co-investigator in the study is Dr. Robert S. Mittler
of Bristol-Myers Co. in Wallingford, Conn.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that is incurable. The virus that
causes AIDS most often is spread through close contact with blood,
blood products or semen from infected people.
   As of July 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 102,621
Americans, of whom more than half, 59,391, have died.

<TEXT>
   A man convicted of using a toddler as a shield
during a gunbattle that left the boy seriously wounded faces a
maximum prison term of 15 years.
   Sentencing for Eric Casseus was scheduled for Oct. 10 after a
jury Thursday found him guilty of assault, reckless endangerment and
endangering the welfare of the 3-year-old child, Gregory Alvarez.
   ``This defendant's crime, grabbing a little boy from his mother
and using him as a shield against flying bullets, was depraved,''
said District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman.
   Elizabeth Sack Felber, Casseus' lawyer, said she would appeal the
verdict. Casseus, 19, told police he was an innocent bystander
mistakenly identified by the child's mother, Modesta Alvarez.
   Casseus, who was shot in the leg, did not testify during his
week-long trial. Prosecutors put Gregory on the witness stand to
show the jury his chest wounds.
   Gregory was walking alongside his mother Feb. 1 when members of
two youth gangs began firing at each other over drugs, police said.
   Mrs. Alvarez took cover between two parked cars with Gregory and
a younger child she was pushing in a carriage. Casseus, one of eight
people involved in the gun fight, grabbed Gregory and held him up as
a shield.
   Casseus let the child go after a bullet went through the boy's
chest and pierced his lungs. The toddler is still recovering.

<HEAD>Student Group Gains Legal Status</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads throughout to ADD more background on dispute over the
student union, past strikes, government complaint. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today legalized a
pro-Solidarity student union and upheld its right to strike over
political and school issues.
   Chants of ``NZS, NZS'' _ the Polish initials for the Independent
Students Association _ broke out in the packed courtroom when the
justices legalized the group, which was banned after the 1981
martial law crackdown.
   ``It should have happened a long time ago,'' said one student
among the 100 spectators.
   The students won the right to include a strike provision in their
charter, a clause that had blocked legalization of the association
even after the Solidarity movement was legalized in April.
   NZS is Poland's largest student union with a strong and vocal
following at universities and high schools. It is the last of the
Solidarity movements to be legalized following the ban on
associations independent of the Communist government that was
imposed after the December 1981 martial law crackdown.
   Since 1980, it has been an alternative to the
Communist-sanctioned Polish Students Association.
   NZS was denied registration on May 23 even though Solidarity and
the independent farmers union Rural Solidarity were legalized after
April accords reached in ``round-table'' talks with Communist
authorities.
   In May, the court said that the labor law did not apply to
students and that they therefore could not claim the right to
strike. The student association refused to change its charter, which
claims the right to strike.
   Registration was delayed again Sept. 9, even though Solidarity's
Tadeusz Mazowiecki had been installed as the East bloc's first
non-Communist prime minister and the government prosecutor told the
court it had no objection to the group's registration.
   Despite the ban, NZS has since 1987 been well represented at
Solidarity demonstrations and has staged its own protests to draw
attention to problems at schools, including low stipends, outdated
equipment, the lack of research and library materials and other
shortages.
   The pressure to legalize NZS grew as the Oct. 2 start of the new
academic year approached. There was concern that failure to register
the association would be met by student protests that could create
instability as the new government tries to reverse Poland's economic
crisis.
   Students, joined by professors and members of parliament,
celebrated the decision in the hallways of the Warsaw courthouse.
   ``At last,'' one said.
   ``We've been functioning anyway but it is nice to be legal
again,'' another said.
   Education Minister Henryk Samsonowicz, a Solidarity supporter who
was Warsaw University rector until he was removed under martial law,
met Wednesday with the national coordinating committee of NZS to
discuss the way the union would function after it was legalized.
   Student strikes demanding the group's registration took place
nationwide during the spring. Students also struck in sympathy to
workers during a wave of labor strikes in May and August of 1988.
   The students then put banners across the university gates, held
rallies, signed petitions, slept on the floors of academic buildings
and sometimes obstructed access to the campus. The government had
complained that the striked played havoc with normal campus life.

<HEAD>Virginia Supreme Court Upholds Conviction Based On DNA Fingerprinting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virginia's highest court, in the nation's
first appeal of a murder trial based on DNA evidence, today upheld
the conviction and death sentence of a man in the rape-murders of
two women.
   The state Supreme Court, in unanimous rulings, said DNA test
results submitted as evidence at two of Timothy W. Spencer's trials
were shown to be ``a reliable scientific technique'' and the tests
were properly conducted.
   Spencer, a 26-year-old former resident of a Richmond halfway
house, was linked to the 1987 rape and murders of Susan Tucker and
Debbie Dudley Davis through so-called DNA fingerprinting.
   DNA is the basic genetic material found in human cells. Everyone
except identical twins is believed to have a unique DNA pattern.
   Spencer was convicted after samples of semen found at the crime
scenes in the two cases were compared to DNA patterns in Spencer's
blood. Experts testified that the samples matched.
   ``The record is replete with uncontradicted expert testimony''
from scientists about the reliability of DNA fingerprinting, the
state court said.
   ``Indeed, Spencer acknowledges that the evidence establishes that
the DNA tests are accepted `as reliable within the scientific
community' and that he `was unable to find or produce one qualified
expert to debunk either the theory of DNA printing or the statistics
generated therefrom,''' the court said.
   Jeffery L. Everhart, an attorney who represented Spencer in the
Davis killing, argued that the DNA procedure, which has been in use
for only a few years, is too unproved to be relied upon exclusively
to put the defendant at the scene of the crime.
   Spencer also was convicted and sentenced to death in two other
murders, and those cases are still on appeal to the state Supreme
Court.

<TEXT>
   A human rights activist was shot and
killed in northern Sri Lanka, witnesses said today, and the
government reported 18 other people were slain in ethnic warfare in
the south.
   Rajani Tiranagma, 40, was gunned down Thursday as she was walking
to her home in Jaffna town, 190 miles north of Colombo, said
residents who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Mrs. Tiranagma, a Tamil married to a Sinhalese, was head of the
anatomy department of Jaffna University.
   No one claimed responsibility for the killing, which witnesses
blamed on two Tamil gunmen. Tamils have been fighting for a separate
homeland in the north and east of Sri Lanka since 1983.
   Ethnic violence that has left scores dead in recent weeks
prompted officials to cancel a major memorial service for the late
Prime Minister Solomon Dias Bandaranaike, said memorial committee
member Upali Rupesinghe.
   About 25,000 people attended last year's ceremony for
Bandaranaike, who was assassinated on Sept. 26, 1959 by a Buddhist
monk. It is the first time the annual service has been canceled.
   Military officials and a government statement put latest
casualties at 18 people killed in five incidents in the south, where
Sinhalese extremists are fighting the government.
   Police discovered 11 bodies with gunshot wounds Thursday in
Heerassagala village, 55 miles northeast of Colombo, said military
officials who customarily are not identified by name. Identities of
the victims were not immediately known.
   Three Sinhalese militants were killed by government troops in two
incidents in the south, a government statement said.
   Two Sinhalese civilians were shot and killed by Sinhalese
radicals in Liyangolla village, 100 miles east of Colombo, the
military officials said.
   In the capital, two unidentified people were found shot and
killed in two separate incidents, military officials said without
elaborating.
   The People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese group, started a
violent campaign against the Sri Lankan government after it signed a
peace accord with India in July 1987 to end a Tamil insurrection.
   The Sinhalese accuse the government of giving too many
concessions to the mainly Hindu Tamils, who account for 18 percent
of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   At least 5,000 people have died since the accord was signed.
About 11,000 others have been killed in the Tamil insurgency. Tamils
said the dominant Sinhalese discriminate against them in jobs and
education.

   Eastern Seaboard residents as far north as Massachusetts braced
for rains and flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Hugo, which
shut schools today in the nation's capital and spoiled plans for a
Sunfest in Maryland.
   Forecasters downgraded Hugo from a hurricane to a tropical storm
this morning, but warned it could spin off tornadoes as it headed
across North Carolina toward inland Virginia, then up the
Appalachian Mountains to New York and New England.
   Donald Maurer, a spokesman for the New York state Disaster
Preparedness Commission in Albany said many people living inland
wrongly believe they're immune from tropical storms in the
Northeast. ``That's not true. Some of the worst flooding in this
state's history has been from storms like Hugo,'' Maurer said.
   ``Two weeks ago, Hurricane Gabrielle only came within 500 miles
of us and we had six deaths and five capsized boats,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Ken Arbogast in Boston. In that case, the
hurricane was far out in the Atlantic.
   At 9 a.m., Hugo's center was located just north of Hickory, N.C.,
in the Blue Ridge foothills, and it was moving toward the north
northwest at 25 to 30 mph, the National Weather Service said. Fears
of flooding moderated somewhat as the storm picked up speed on its
march northward, ensuring that rain wouldn't linger quite as long
over any one place.
   ``We're just hoping there aren't thunderstorms ahead of it,
because that would mean a flood threat,'' said weather service
metrologist Bill Coneaux.
   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to have decreased to 60
mph, with higher gusts in squalls. Hickory had gusts of up to 73 mph
this morning.
   In Maryland and Delaware, from 5 to 10 inches of rain and wind
gusts of up to 70 mph were expected to buffet the Chesapeake region
this afternoon.
   With the storm expected to hit the Baltimore-Washington area
around the afternoon rush hour, the District of Columbia, federal
and Maryland governments told employees they could leave early if
necessary, transit authorities added service and officials closed
schools in the capital and its suburbs.
   Ocean City, Md., canceled its annual Sunfest festival set for
this weekend, as hotels reported an increasing number of tourists
calling off their beach visits.
   In Nelson County, Va., where 128 people were killed in floods and
mudslides caused by Hurricane Camille in 1969, workers hurriedly set
up a network of electronic rain gauges to act as an early warning
device, Sheriff William Harris said.
   But to the 50 or so surfers in the water at Virginia Beach on
Thursday evening, thoughts of the coming storm centered on the waves.
   ``It's pretty good right now,'' said Joe Wool, 23. ``The waves
are breaking about head high.''
   Farther north, a flash flood watch was posted statewide in both
Delaware and Maryland, in addition to a high wind warning for New
Castle County, Del. Hagerstown, in western Maryland, could have
winds of 30 to 50 mph with higher gusts, the National Weather
Service said this morning.
   Tropical storm warnings remained in effect this morning from
Virginia Beach northward to Manasquan, N.J., including Chesapeake
and Delaware bays.
   Commanders at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware ordered the
evacuation of their fleet of jet transports late Thursday.
   In New York, forecasters said vestiges of Hugo could cause severe
rain and flooding.
   Hugo could hit New York State some time tonight or Saturday
before passing through southern New England, according to
meteorologist Robert Barton in Albany.
   Barton said there could be 2 to 4 inches of rain in parts of New
York south of Albany, including New York City.
   In Connecticut, forecasters said the state faces winds between 20
mph and 40 mph in the Hartford area, with 2 to 4 inches of rain
likely by Saturday.
   ``We will be spared a direct hit from the storm,'' said Mel
Goldstein, director of the Weather Center at Western Connecticut
State University in Danbury. ``We should be ready for some power
outages and some localized flooding.''
   Some Connecticut residents, particularly those living near Long
Island Sound, were not taking any chances.
   In Greenwich, hardware stores were busy all day Thursday with
customers buying everything from flashlights to waterproof tarps.
   ``One guy came in and bought a generator. He said he was just
taking it for precaution,'' said Steve McDow, a salesman at the
Super Handy Hardware Center in Greenwich.
   In Massachusetts, heavy rains with flooding in low-lying areas
were expected in the Boston area, according to Jim Roets, a National
Weather Service meterologist.
   The storm already has postponed a statewide shoreline cleanup
scheduled for Saturday.
   ``In the aftermath of the coming storm, e will need even more
people available to help pick up all the debris that's bound to wash
up on our shores,'' said John DeVillars, state environmental affairs
secretary.

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham says the state Supreme
Court should have jurisdiction over his his effort to be reinstated
and that he should be paid more than $600,000.
   ``One of the very key things that the judicial branch is for on
the higher levels is to make sure the executive nor the legislative
branch violates the constitution and violates people's rights,''
Mecham said after a hearing Thursday in state Supreme Court on his
petition for special action.
   Mecham, who last year became the nation's first governor removed
by impeachment in nearly 60 years, is asking the state's highest
court to review his case.
   The ousted governor called comments by Justice Stanley Feldman
and Deputy Attorney General Kathy Cook saying they could not enter
into the case ``baloney.''
   Ms. Cook told the justices that the separation of powers
prevented them from examining the legislative branch's impeachment
provision, and Feldman appeared to agree, saying: ``We can't make
the Senate do anything. They are a separate branch of government.''
   Ms. Cook also said Mecham and his supporters ``suffered no
violation of their constitutional rights.''
   Mecham's lawyer, however, said lawmakers violated the state and
federal constitutions when they impeached and ousted Mecham last
year. He asked the justices to restore Mecham to office and pay him
more than $600,000.
   ``Either the constitution means what it says, or it isn't worth
the paper its written on,'' Mecham's attorney, Donald MacPherson,
told a packed courtroom.
   The justices took the case under advisement but did not say when
they would decide what to do with it.
   Mecham is running for governor in 1990 and wants the money to
help him in his new campaign. He was removed from office April 4,
1988, on charges he misused money in a state protocol fund and tried
to obstruct an investigation into the actions of an underling.

<TEXT>
   Christian leader Michel Aoun today
accepted a seven-point Arab peace plan aimed at ending the
6-month-old bloodbath between his forces and Syrian troops, who
control 70 percent of the country.
   Arab League envoy Lakhdar al-Ibrahimi made the announcement after
an hour-long meeting with Gen. Aoun at his office in a bunker under
the bomb-ravaged presidential palace in Beirut's suburb of Baabda.
   ``I am glad to inform you that the general has accepted the terms
(of the plan) and has agreed that we start working to implement
them,'' said Ibrahimi, assistant secretary-general of the 22-member
Arab League.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads a
Syrian-backed Cabinet vying for legitimacy with Aoun's Christian
government, and Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite
Moslem, have already accepted the plan.
   Shiite militia chieftain Nabih Berri and Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt, who are Syria's main allies in Lebanon also have endorsed
it.
   Ibrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, was asked by an Arab League
committee to head a security committee to supervise the cease-fire
and monitor ships to ensure no weapons supplies reach Lebanese
factions.
   Aoun initially said he would not send a representative to such a
committee because it did not include a Syrian representative. He
said Syria was trying to portray the crisis as one among Lebanese
factions, even though Syrian forces in Lebanon are the main party
fighting his Christian troops.
   But France and the United States, traditional backers of the
Christians, and several Arab governments voiced support for the
peace plan and urged Aoun to display flexibility to avoid further
bloodshed.
   ``Thank God, all the brethren in Lebanon have agreed that we
start implementing this plan,'' Ibrahimi said.
   The Arab League plan, drafted by leaders of Saudi Arabia, Morocco
and Algeria, calls for a cease-fire, lifting of blockades and
opening Beirut airport.
   It also invites the 73 surviving members of Lebanon's 99-seat
Parliament to meet outside the country to formulate political
reforms. These would give the country's Moslems, an estimated 55
percent of the population, an equal share of power with the
traditionally dominant Christians.
   In another development, an oil tanker carrying badly needed
gasoline for Lebanon's besieged Christians played hide-and-seek for
three hours with Syrian artillery before slipping into port before
dawn.
   Police said the Lebanese-flagged Timex Star ran the gantlet of
radar-controlled Syrian shellfire to deliver its cargo of 660,000
gallons of fuel at Jounieh, 12 miles north of Beirut.
   ``The captain ducked into a bay north of Jounieh, putting
mountains between him and the Syrian radar and blocking it. Then he
hugged the coast to slip into port,'' a police spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said the Syrians used
long-range artillery in Moslem west Beirut, from mountains
overlooking the Christian enclave and in north Lebanon, in their
effort to sink the Timex Star.
   The Christians, critically short of fuel after a 6-month-long
Syrian blockade, began unloading the fuel 15 minutes after the
tanker docked.
   Syrian attempts to sink the tanker caused an artillery duel
between the Syrians and Aoun's forces in and around Beirut that left
two people killed and seven wounded, police said. That raised the
toll to 929 killed and 2,738 wounded since the latest fighting began
March 8.
   The Christians control a 28-mile strip of coast north of Beirut.
With their enclave ringed on its three landward sides by the Syrians
and their Lebanese Moslem militia allies, the coastal strip is their
only lifeline.
   In the 14-year-old civil war, more than 150,000 people have been
killed and more than 1 million of Lebanon's 4 million people have
been displaced.

   Neighbors were breakfasting, heading to work
or asleep in bed when an explosion at a military barracks turned
their homes to rubble and they were confronted with the sight of
bodies being carried away.
   ``There was a terrific crash which reminded me of the Blitz.
After that, the ceiling started to fall down around me,'' said Joan
Betteridge, a pensioner in the southern England town of Deal, where
the blast at the Royal Marines School of Music occurred.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed reponsibilty for the explosion,
which police said killed 11 people and injured 22.
   Nearby resident Sean Minnock said: ``I was asleep but woke up
with a hell of a jolt ... the bedroom ceiling fell in on me. I woke
to find huge slabs of plaster on the bed and floor.''
   From the wrecked, smoke-clouded barracks, ``I could hear
terrified screams of agony. People started rushing about all over
the place. It was horrible to watch and listen to,'' said Minnock,
28.
   ``I knew people had been seriously hurt. I saw the rescuers pull
out two bodies. I knew they were dead when they put them on the
floor and put bed blankets right over them.''
   Minnock's wife, Janet, said the roof of their house was torn off
and all the back windows were shattered.
   ``The house has been blown to bits,'' she said.
   Mrs. Minnock was feeding her 2-year-old son Thomas his breakfast
when the explosion wrecked four terraced houses in the street
backing onto the barracks.
   Her next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, 26, was standing at her
kitchen window facing the barracks, holding her 4-month-old son Luke
in her arms. Her other boys, Ben, 3, and Joshua, 2, were at her side.
   ``I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building
explode,'' she said. ``I told the boys to run and as Joshua turned a
sliver of glass embedded itself in his back.
   ``The whole window was blown across the kitchen. I just screamed
and ran out of the room. The bang was so loud I thought the whole
house was coming in.
   ``At first I thought for sure Joshua had been seriously injured.
There was blood coming out of his back.'' Doctors removed the glass
and sent him home.
   College student Simon Mitford, 17, narrowly escaped being injured
in the explosion because he got up earlier than usual.
   ``His room was completely wrecked by the blast,'' his brother
Alex said.
   Of the barracks, he said: ``I heard music playing and then it
went bang and there was glass everywhere. It was a two-story
building but now 90 percent of it is rubble.
   ``I heard a marine scream out, `The band is under there.' I was
scared there was going to be a second explosion.''

<TEXT>
   Militant black unions today
launched a nationwide consumer boycott of white-owned stores, and
25,000 people staged protest marches in a major city and a
conservative farming town.
   The unions, seeking to overturn a controversial labor law, also
told their 1.5 million members to refuse to work overtime for the
next four weeks.
   Union leaders said the action could cut industrial production by
20 percent or force white employers to hire thousands of additional
black workers.
   A coalition of anti-apartheid women's groups said they would
proceed with a major march Saturday on government headquarters in
Pretoria despite a ban.
   The government, for the first time in decades, has allowed
several protest marches this month, but the women's march was banned
because its leaders refused to seek permission.
   Laura Pollecutt, one of the march organizers, said her colleagues
had notified authorities of the planned route but did not feel their
right to protest was subject to government approval.
   In Durban, South Africa's largest port and third-largest city, an
estimated 15,000 people of all races, including members of the white
city council, joined a peaceful anti-government march to City Hall
this afternoon.
   About 10,000 protesters led by the Rev. Allan Boesak, president
of the World Alliance, staged a similar march in Oudtshoorn, a town
of 40,000 people in southern Cape Province. It was by far the
largest protest ever in Oudtshoorn, center of the ostrich-farming
industry and the scene of frequent confrontations between police and
activists.
   After a 5.5-mile march, the protesters presented police with a
list of demands, including a halt to alleged harassment of activists
and the arrest of vandals who desecrated tombs of three youths
killed by police during unrest in 1985.
   Durban and Oudtshoorn police kept a low profile, in accordance
with the government's 10-day-old policy of permitting some political
protests. But Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee filed court papers
today seeking to ban the women's march.
   The union protests were intended to pressure employers into
renouncing a new labor law which unions say undermines their ability
to strike. Union leaders urged all blacks to join the consumer
boycott, which they said was part of a broad-based national defiance
campaign that began in early August.
   There was no immediate word from retail organizations about the
extent of the consumer boycott, which is intended to continue
through Oct. 6. But department stores in the eastern Cape Province
cities of East London and King William's Town, where the boycott
began early, were reported virtually deserted on Thursday.
   The defiance campaign has included protests of segregation laws,
as well as mass marches in cities across the country, the first such
demonstrations allowed by the government for decades.
   All the recent marches had been peaceful until Thursday, when
some black youths smashed windows of shops and vehicles as marchers
dispersed in Pietermaritzburg, capital of Natal Province. No arrests
or injuries were reported, but pro-government media gave headline
treatment to the incident.
   Magistrates in several cities issued warnings today that
organizers of protest marches must request permission at least seven
days in advance. Leaders of most of the recent marches have refused
to apply for a permit.
   Several prominent activists have been detained during the
defiance campaign, including white Cape Town lawyer Willie Hofmeyr.
His father said today that Hofmeyr has ended a 28-day hunger strike
and indicated that Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok was
considering releasing the activist.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest black
labor federation, said no violence or coercion should be used to
enforce the consumer boycott. The 1-million-member congress said
black shopkeepers should avoid raising their prices during the
boycott.
   The boycott also is endorsed by the National Congress of Trade
Unions, which claims 500,000 members.
   The target of the union protests is the Labor Relations Amendment
Act, enacted by the government last year despite strenuous
objections from black unions. Some of its original, hard-line
provisions were modified, but unions still object to sections which
prohibit sympathy strikes, restrict the frequency of strikes against
any particular company, and make it easier for unions to be held
liable for strike-related losses.

   Legislation aimed at freeing a District of
Columbia mother, jailed for more than two years in a child custody
dispute, is headed to President Bush's desk after passing the Senate
early today.
   ``I haven't spoken directly with the president, but we're told he
is sympathetic and that the White House staff will encourage him to
sign it,'' Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., said.
   The measure would limit civil contempt of court jailings in the
nation's capital to one year in child custody cases. Passed by the
House on Wednesday, the measure is drawn to deal with the case of
Dr. Elizabeth Morgan.
   Both houses voted by unanimous consent for the bill.
   Morgan was sent to jail in August 1987 after refusing a judge's
order to produce her daughter, Hilary, for court-ordered visits with
Dr. Eric Foretich, Morgan's ex-husband and the girl's father.
   Morgan has alleged that Foretich sexually abused the child, who
now is 7 years old. Foretich has repeatedly denied those charges.
   Morgan's attorneys have argued that her continued jailing
violates her constitutional rights. In August, a three-judge appeals
court panel agreed, ruling that because she is unlikely to produce
her daughter, the effect of keeping her in jail has gone from
coercive to unconstitutionally punitive.
   Foretich's attorney, Elaine Mittleman, said today the law is
unconstitutional and threatened court action to block Morgan's
release.
   The full District of Columbia Court of Appeals is now considering
the case.
   The congressional measure, which would apply retroactively to the
Morgan case, would allow prosecutors to file criminal contempt
charges after someone has been jailed for six months. That would
guarantee a jury trial before a different judge than the one who
issued the contempt citation.
   The measure would expire after 18 months.

   Palestinians clubbed to death two Arabs
suspected of collaborating with Israel, Arab and army reports said
today.
   The army announced it is improving procedures for notifying
families when relatives are detained, following numerous complaints
from lawyers and families unable to locate suspects in military
custory.
   An army spokesman said new detainees will be required to write
postcards to their family that will be mailed daily from detention
centers. There was no such procedure in the past, he said.
   Lists of prisoners also will be forwarded more rapidly for
posting in military government offices, he said, and families that
still cannot find missing relatives can appeal to the military
government for assistance.
   The new measures come after the Israeli Association for Civil
Rights appealed to the Supreme Court to intervene. The case was
dropped when the army agreed to implement new rules.
   At least 50,000 Palestinians have been detained for varying
periods during the 21-month-old Palestinian uprising, according to
the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights.
   Also today, a Jerusalem court acquitted a Shin Bet security
service agent suspected of negligence in the death of a Palestinian
during interrogation, an attorney for the agent said. The agent was
acquitted for lack of proof of the case against him, the attorney
said.
   Awad Hamdan, 23, died in custody in July 1987, two days after his
arrest for allegedly belonging to an illegal organization, a charge
usually applied to members of the PLO and other Palestinian groups.
   Israeli officials reportedly first claimed Hamdan died of a heart
attack or was bitten by a snake. The family later appealed to the
Supreme Court saying torture marks were visible on Hamdan's body.
   The mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot reported a pathological
examination showed Hamdan died of pneumonia which he may have
contracted during his interrogation.
   Palestinian suspects have often complained of being submitted to
cold showers during Shin Bet interrogations.
   A general strike shut down the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
today. The strike was called to show solidarity with jailed
activists and deportees.
   At least 9,392 Arabs currently are jailed, 2,124 of them under
laws allowing the army to hold them without trial for up to one
year. Sixty Palestinians have been deported from the occupied
territories during the uprising.
   Masked enforcers beat 36-year-old Saeed Abu Jazar to death near
his Rafah town house in the Gaza Strip, Arab journalists and Israel
radio said. Arab reports said Jazar was accused of collaborating
with Israel and dealing in drugs.
   Also in Rafah, Nawal Abu Nims, 30, was reported hospitalized in
critical condition from a beating by masked youths who accused her
of being a prostitute.
   At Israel's Ketziot prison camp in the Negev desert, Palestinian
inmates killed another suspected collaborator, 23-year-old Karim
Abed Kareem, Arab reports said. The army confirmed his death and
said it was checking the circumstances.
   At least 116 Palestinians accused of collaborating have been
killed by fellow Arabs during the uprising, and 573 have been killed
by Israeli troops or civilians. Forty Israelis also have died.

   Constance Bland had heard all the horror
stories about what could go wrong in the days before her wedding.
   But in her wildest dreams she never expected her groom to be in a
plane crash. Or a hurricane to wipe out both her honeymoon plans and
the hotel arrangements for out-of-town guests.
   Barring further disaster, Satuday's wedding will go on.
   ``I'm so stressed out right now, there's no way I could handle
planning this again,'' Miss Bland said late Thursday as Hurricane
Hugo approached the South Carolina coast. ``If I can just walk down
that aisle with 10 people in the church, I'll be happy.''
   Her fiance, Tom Newberry, a New York City banker, was a passenger
on the USAir jetliner that plunged into New York's East River late
Wednesday after an aborted takeoff from LaGuardia Airport. Two women
were killed. The plane had been en route to Charlotte.
   Newberry, 27, survived the crash and was reportedly driving to
Wilmington for the wedding.
   Newberry crawled out of the wrecked plane and clung to a piling
in the water with other passengers until rescuers arrived.
   ``He said they sang `Row, Row, Row Your Boat,' trying to stay
calm,'' Miss Bland said.
   About 45 minutes after the Blands first heard about the crash,
Newberry called them. Miss Bland said he assured her he was unhurt,
but she thought he was in shock. All he could talk about was his
baggage.
   Newberry's passport and his tuxedo rest somewhere at the bottom
of the East River. But the wedding will go on.
   ``We thought about calling it off, but with so many people coming
down here, I just don't think my nerves could take it,'' Miss Bland
said.
   About 225 guests are expected. Miss Bland's mother spent most of
Thursday trying to find hotel rooms for the 50 guests who had
planned to check into a hotel at Wrightsville Beach, which was
ordered evacuated as Hugo approached.
   The storm caused little damage at Wrightsville Beach, where the
family plans to hold a reception dinner.
   As for the honeymoon _ which had been scheduled for the British
Virgin Islands before they were devastated by the hurricane _ the
couple will make other plans.
   ``I suggested Iowa,'' Miss Bland said, ``somewhere far, far away
from the water.''

   Sigmund Freud prepared for death the same way he
probed the human psyche _ stoically saying goodbye to friends and
colleagues and calmly asking for a shot of morphine to end his long,
painful battle with cancer.
   The American Psychiatric Association and several other
organizations are commemorating his death in London on Sept. 23,
1939, at age 83.
   The APA will join affiliate organizations in Philadelphia on
Saturday in presenting a symposium, ``Through the Looking Glass:
Freud's Impact on Contemporary Culture.''
   Freud propelled the primitive field of psychiatry into the
mainstream of popular culture, transforming the way people thought
and spoke. Thanks to Freud, personal problems are now referred to as
``complexes,'' and an embarrassing verbal mishap is called a
``Freudian slip.''
   Although many of his theories and opinions have been questioned,
psychiatrists still hail Freud's most central premises.
   ``He brought out the existence of an unconscious process as a
major determinant of how we think and feel and act,'' said Dr.
Stephen Sonnenberg, the APA's chairman of the Committee of Public
Information. ``He also revealed the sexuality of children, and
founded the developmental approach to understanding human growth.''
   ``He saw the unconscious was more than just something you happen
not to remember right now,'' said Peter Gay, a Yale University
history professor and author of ``Freud: a Life for Our Time.''
   The son of a Jewish wool merchant, Sigismund Schlomo Freud was
born May 6, 1856, in Freiberg, Austria, and moved to Vienna four
years later.
   He studied medicine and philosophy at the University of Vienna.
In late 1874, Freud described himself to a friend as ``a godless
medical student and an empiricist.''
   From 1876-82, he worked in the laboratory of Josef Breuer, a
prominent physician and physiologist, and developed a passion for
research with studies of the nervous systems of everything from fish
to humans.
   After he left Breuer to take a junior post at Vienna's General
Hospital, Breuer told him about one of his patients, a young
``hysteric'' with the pseudonym ``Anna O.,'' who became sick in 1880
a few months after her father fell fatally ill.
   Freud built on the case, insisting there were sexual anxieties
behind Anna O.'s neuroses, and applying his ideas to other
``hysterics.''
   By 1892, using the famous couch _ given by a former patient and
piled high with pillows _ Freud had developed the basic methods
still used by psychiatrists today: observation, interpretation, free
association and the gradual working through of afflictions.
   Freud worked and lived for 47 years in the Vienna house known as
Berggasse 19. He married Martha Bernays in 1886, and had three sons
_ Oliver, Enrst and Martin, and three daughters _ Anna, Mathilde and
Sophie.
   Rigorous, self-critical, relentlessly curious, Freud drew on the
experiences of himself and his patients, and tapped into new ideas.
   In his 1899 book, ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' he theorized
that dreams were wish fulfillments and revealed hidden desires or
fears. He also offered a rough sketch for what was later called
``The Oedipus Complex,'' writing that young children are in love
with the parent of the opposite sex and driven to kill the one of
the same sex.
   In 1923, he published ``The Ego and the Id,'' proclaiming the
mind consisted of an ``id,'' which sought pleasure, a ``superego,''
the source of morality and the ``ego,'' the mediator between the two.
   Freud's remarks about women, whose sexual lives he once referred
to as ``the dark continent,'' were often attacked. He confessed in
the late 1920s that nearly 30 years of researching the ``feminine
soul'' had produced no answers.
   He insisted that women suffered from ``penis envy,'' which
brought on feelings of jealousy and inferiority.
   The cancer that eventually killed him first emerged in February
1923 when Freud, admittedly hooked on cigars, developed a benign
growth on his jaw and palate; he underwent surgery. Although his
hearing was affected, resulting eventually in almost total deafness
in his right ear, he refused to give up cigars.
   In September 1938, six months after the Nazis marched into
Austria, the cancerous growth returned, and surgery was again
required. He began to receive radium treatments, but continued to
see patients.
   With the persecution of Jews in Austria, an enfeebled Freud left
Vienna in June 1938 and spent his remaining days in London.
   His health rapidly deteriorated, and on Sept. 21, 1939, Freud's
longtime physician, Dr. Max Schur, injected him with three
centigrams of morphine, one more centigram than the normal dosage,
causing a deep, peaceful sleep. Freud lapsed into a coma the next
day and died in the early morning of Sept. 23.
   The Philadelphia symposium coincides with the opening of an
exhibit from his personal collection that will be shown in 10 U.S.
cities, culminating Nov. 3-5 with a conference at the University of
South Carolina.
   At London's Freud Museum, converted from the Hampstead house
where he spent the last year of his life, a new exhibit opened
featuring previously undisplayed items.

<HEAD>Key Senators Reach Compromise on Acid Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Key Senate clean air sponsors said today
they've reached a political compromise on acid rain that would
benefit seven states that cleaned up emissions from coal-fired power
plants.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., predicted their agreement would win support for
clean air legislation. The compromise is not included in President
Bush's clean air plan which is undergoing consideration by a House
subcommittee.
   Both the administration and Baucus-Mitchell plans are designed to
reduce the major component of acid rain, sulfur dioxide, by 10
million tons _ and prevent any growth of emissions after the
reductions are achieved.
   The Bush bill would require the reduction by the end of the year
2000 and the Mitchell-Baucus requires the improvement by Jan. 1,
2000.
   The agreement would exempt states from making further sulfur
dioxide reductions through the start of 2000, if more than one half
of their coal-fired power plants utilize pollution-reducing
equipment called scrubbers.
   According to a list handed out by the senators, the provision
would benefit Baucus' state of Montana, Kansas, Minnesota, North
Dakota, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.
   Current law requires all new coal-fired power plants to use
scrubbers, including states that burn clean, low sulfur coal mined
in the West.
   ``This ... requirement has imposed a huge, and environmentally
unjustified, burden on the West,'' Baucus said. Mitchell said
``millions of dollars'' have been spent on the scrubbers.
   Acid rain is formed in the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide, and is carried hundreds of miles before raining down
to earth. Acid rain destroys aquatic life in lakes and streams,
damages trees in forests and can damage human lungs.

<HEAD>Defense Minister Tries to Assure Cambodians as Vietnam Withdraws</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BATTAMBANG, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense minister said Friday that
government troops can defend Cambodia against a guerrilla coalition,
despite a surge in nearby fighting that has accompanied the
withdrawal of Vietnamese soldiers.
   Defense Minister Tea Banh spoke at a farewell ceremony for
departing soldiers on the second day of Vietnam's troop withdrawal.
Vietnam has promised to have all of its 26,000 troops out of
Cambodia by Sept. 26.
   Officers from the two countries embraced, and hundreds of
townspeople laughed and cheered as girls tied Cambodian scarves
around the necks of Vietnamese troops.
   ``I'm very, very happy to be going home,'' said Nguyen Hoang Thy,
21, who spent three years in Cambodia. ``It's been sad because we
lost a lot of people fighting here.''
   Vietnam says more than 25,000 of its people have died in Cambodia
since it invaded on Christmas 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge, which
killed hundreds of thousands of people during its rule from 1975 to
1978.
   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest in the three-party guerrilla
coalition fighting the government installed by Vietnam. Many
analysts say Cambodia's army, estimated at 50,000, is poorly trained
and led and could have problems fighting the guerrillas alone.
   In an interview with reporters in Phnom Penh on Friday, Deputy
Defense Minister Ke Kim Yan said as many as 450 Khmer Rouge
guerrillas were shelling the Pailin area of Battambang province with
up to 2,000 mortar rounds per day.
   ``We are mobilizing all our men so we will not lose Pailin,'' Ke
Kim Yan said.
   Pailin's forests and mountains could provide good hiding places
for the guerrillas, while gem mines in the area could help bankroll
the opposition forces.
   The guerrillas maintain bases along the Thai-Cambodian border,
not far from Battambang.
   ``We have built up our home forces both quantitatively and
qualitatively to the point that they can take the place of
Vietnamese troops in defending the territory along the western
region,'' Tea Banh told the farewell ceremony.
   Other farewell ceremonies were held in Pursat and Kompong Chhnang
provinces north of Phnom Penh.
   In the town of Pursat on Wednesday night, two hours of steady
artillery shelling was heard in the distance.
   Cambodian officials say 20 foreign observers are monitoring the
Vietnamese pullout.
   ``I won't report that I have proof of a complete withdrawal, but
we believe that Vietnam is withdrawing all its troops,'' said Bali
Ram Bhagat, an observer from India who watched the troop movements
at Battambang.
   At Battambang, townspeople lined the streets, cheering and waving
Cambodian and Vietnamese flags as the Vietnamese waved back from
their of Soviet and aging U.S.-made trucks.
   Orange-robed Buddhist priests showered the departing Vietnamese
officers with water in a blessing.
   India is the only major non-communist country that recognizes the
Phnom Penh government instead of the guerrilla coalition. Besides
India, the only official non-socialist government officials seen
observing the troop movements were from Belgium.
   China arms the guerrillas, while Thailand shelters them.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle on Friday denounced
Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrilla group as ``mass murderers'' and
said the non-communist resistance is the best hope for the war-torn
country.
   Quayle, attending a meeting of the International Democratic
Union, made his comments at a news conference with other
conservative politicians from around the world as Vietnamese forces
were withdrawing from Cambodia.
   The withdrawal poses the threat that the fanatical Khmer Rouge
may eventually defeat the Vietnamese-backed Cambodian government
forces and other resistance groups.
   The vice president was asked how the United States could oppose
Soviet aid to Cambodia's government when the aid was to be used to
combat the communist Khmer Rouge, which was ousted from power after
Vietnam's 1978 invasion.
   Washington favors the non-communist resistance groups, led by
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and hopes the Cambodian people can
determine their own future, Quayle said.
   ``We are very sensitive and very aware of the past atrocities
that were committed by the Khmer Rouge,'' he said. ``The mass
murderers of the Khmer Rouge should not and shall not return to
power.''
   The best course, he said, is to strive for democracy through the
other resistance groups. ``The non-communist resistance offers the
best hope for the future of Cambodia.''
   The Khmer Rouge are blamed for killing hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians in a radical campaign to create a pure communist society.
   Quayle also said the United States hopes China will return to
more moderate policies that prevailed before military force was used
to crush pro-democracy demonstrations in June. Until China changes,
he said, Washington will continue the sanctions imposed by President
Bush, including a ban on high-level contacts and other measures.
   ``The ball is in China's court. ... Nothing has changed in China
to change our policies that were clearly articulated by the
president,'' Quayle said.
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said his country will lift
an advisory against traveling to Beijing but will not resume
negotiations on economic aid until after Chinese authorities lift
martial law in the capital. Japan is the source of about 80 percent
of China's bilateral economic assistance.
   In speeches earlier to the conference, Quayle and British Prime
Minster Margaret Thatcher said it would be dangerous for the West to
become complacent because of democratic reforms in the Soviet Union
and other East bloc nations.
   The International Democrat Union is a group of right-of-center
political parties in 26 countries whose leaders meet every two years.
   Mrs. Thatcher left for Moscow on Friday afternoon and is to hold
talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev before returning to
London.
   Quayle is to travel Saturday to visit U.S. military bases in
northern Japan, and next week he holds talks with Kaifu and other
Japanese leaders before traveling to the Philippines and Malaysia.
   Despite clashes in Manila on Friday between police and about
1,000 leftists who oppose Quayle's visit, a senior U.S.
administration official said plans for the trip to the Philippines
had not changed.

   A strong earthquake hit southwest China's Sichuan
province Friday, injuring about 20 people, an official report said.
   The quake, measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale, hit Xiaojin county
in central Sichuan and was felt in 12 counties and two cities, the
Xinhua News Agency said.
   In the worst-hit area, houses collapsed, cracks appeared on
highways and a mine was damaged.
   Five earthquakes, the strongest measuring 6.7 on the Richter
scale, struck western Sichuan in a three-week period in June and
July, killing 11 people.
   China's worst earthquake in 12 years struck neighboring Yunnan
province almost a year ago. That quake, measuring 7.6, killed 730
people.
   The Richter scale is a guage of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.

   An explosion today flattened a military
barracks and tore through nearby homes, killing 11 people and
injuring 22, police said. The IRA claimed responsibility for the
blast.
   More than 100 rescue workers frantically dug through the rubble
of a three-story building that collapsed at the Royal Marines School
of Music near Deal. Stunned neighbors gathered outside homes that
were damaged or destroyed.
   Chief Police Inspector Alan Butterfield of Kent, who who provided
the casualty figures and coordinated the rescue effort, first
reported that one person was missing but later said everyone was
accounted for.
   He said many of the injured were seriously hurt.
   ``There was a terrific crash which reminded me of the Blitz.
After that, the ceiling started to fall down around me,'' said
pensioner Joan Betteridge.
   Defense Secretary Tom King, inspecting the wreckage, said: ``It
is not yet absolutely confirmed that it is a bomb, but all the
evidence is quite clearly that this is an IRA atrocity.''
   British military installations are a frequent bombing target of
the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of
British rule, but today's explosion in the coastal town 70 miles
southeast of London was the worst IRA attack on the British mainland
in more than seven years.
   The explosion occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the
barracks. One of the bands had just stopped playing on the parade
ground, said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping
with British custom.
   Dozens of homes near the school were damaged, including four that
were destroyed. Witnesses reported hearing the explosion two miles
away.
   The Defense Ministry would not say how many servicemen and
civilians were included in the casualty figures. However, King told
reporters the attack was directed against ``unarmed bandsmen.''
   Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to
search through the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin
Simmons.
   Ten doctors were giving emergency treatment at the scene and 11
ambulances were taking the injured to two hospitals, the ambulance
service said.
   A statement telephoned to Ireland International, a Dublin news
agency, said ``we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent'' in
response to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Northern
Ireland nine days ago.
   The IRA said Mrs. Thatcher went to the British province ``with a
message of war,'' but ``we still want peace and we want the British
government to leave our country.'' It was signed P. O'Neill, a nom
de guerre the IRA usually uses to claim responsibility for actions
outside Northern Ireland.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey issued a statement in Dublin
condemning the attack, calling it an ``outrage.''
   The last IRA bomb attempt on the British mainland was in February
when about 60 soldiers were evacuated from their barracks in
Shropshire, western England, just before a bomb exploded. One
soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA bomb attack on an army
barracks in north London in August 1988.
   In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the
Household Cavalry barracks in central London and at a bandstand in
the capital's Regent's Park where an army band was playing. Three
people died later and a total of 51 were injured in the bombings.
   The music school is the training center for young recruits who
want to play in the seven Royal Marines bands. Up to 250 young men,
most between 16 and 20, are based at the school, where they receive
military and musical training.
   The roof of Janet Minnock's house was torn off by the force of
the blast and all the back windows were shattered.
   ``The house has been blown to bits,'' she said. ``We are all
shaken up.''
   Mrs. Minnock's next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, said she was
standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks at the time of
the explosion. She was holding her 4-month-old son Luke in her arms
with her other boys, Ben, 3, and Joshua, 2, at her side.
   ``I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building
explode,'' she said. ``I told the boys to run and as Joshua turned a
slither of glass embedded itself in his back. The whole window was
blown across the kitchen. I just screamed and ran out of the room.
The bang was so loud I thought the whole house was coming in.''
   Sean Minnock said: ``I was asleep but woke up with a hell of a
jolt.''
   As workers tried to patch holes in his roof, he said: ``The
bedroom ceiling fell in on me. I woke to find huge slabs of plaster
on the bed and floor. I wondered what it was. As soon as I got up I
looked out of what was left of the window and knew it was the
barracks.''

   While Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph wind
roared outside, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. watched the fury it vented
on his beloved, 300-year-old city.
   Riley, city officials and a few reporters stayed in Charleston's
historic City Hall through Thursday night as the area's worst
hurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the Civil
War began.
   Late in the day, there was hope Hugo might spare Charleston. But
the storm gathered strength and speed as it spun straight toward
this city, which had survived a number of near misses from great
storms in recent years.
   From the moment it became apparent Hugo might strike the
Southeast coast, many Charlestonians conceded that, this time, their
number was up.
   As Hugo's wind howled outside the plywood boards protecting the
windows, reporters wandered in and out of Riley's office. On his
desk several candles burned as insurance against the inevitable loss
of power.
   Later there was a sharp crack as a piece of the tin roof ripped
off and water seeped down on the burnished wood tables in the City
Council chamber. Phone and electric service to the city command post
was knocked out.
   During it all, Riley kept in close contact with the National
Weather Service. As the eye of the storm passed, he took reporters
onto the porch of the 188-year-old brick City Hall to look at the
damage.
   The initial view, sketched out in the glow of flashlights, was
unsettling: The tin roof was tossed in the gutter, slate tiles were
scattered on the ground. Bricks, sticks and leaves littered the
street.
   ``This is the eye of the hurricane. I've never been in one and I
hope I'm never in one again,'' Riley said. ``It's scarcely a late
summer breeze.''
   As the storm died before dawn, Riley was out on the streets again
in a raincoat carrying a flashlight to get a better assessment of
the damage.
   ``Serious but fixable,'' the mayor concluded.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
noting a ``new openness and candor,'' raised expectations today of
superpower arms control agreements as he opened talks in a lakeside
lodge with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   The sessions, which wind up with a fishing date Sunday morning,
are designed to produce a general time frame for President Bush's
first summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
sometime next year.
   The Soviets also are hinting they are in a mood to compromise on
some tough arms control issues. And Baker, posing for pictures with
Shevardnadze, took an upbeat stance.
   ``I believe and I think most would agree that there is a new
opennes and candor in our relationship,'' he said. ``And I think
that hopefully we'll be able to take some steps that are
unprecedented....''
   Shevardnadze, asked to comment on Bush administration statements
that a summit would be held sometime next year, said, ``We'll be
discussing this today.''
   Baker said, ``I think we will have an announcement before we
leave about a general time frame for this.''
   The two men began the day with a discussion with close advisers,
then spoke briefly to reporters on the terrace of the Jackson Lake
Lodge overlooking the Grand Tetons mountain range and a pair of
moose grazing on the flatlands below.
   In a meeting with several dozen aides from both sides,
Shevardnadze declared that ``it is high time to move from mutual
understanding to mutual action. Because, from our meetings, I
understand that conceptually there is a full understanding'' between
the two sides.
   Baker suggested that they move immediately to another meeting
with their closest advisers, forgoing a planned session with the
entire delegation, and allowing working groups to negotiate on sharp
reductions in nuclear, chemical and conventional forces as well as
other issues.
   The two posed for pictures before starting their two days of
talks deep in the Rocky Mountains that could set a course for
further superpower weapons cutbacks.
   
   Baker suggested that they move immediately to another meeting
with their closest advisers, forgoing a planned session with the
entire delegation, and allowing working groups to negotiate on sharp
reductions in nuclear, chemical and conventional forces as well as
other issues.
   ``We want to preserve and strengthen the improving international
environment,'' Baker said as he arrived Thursday night.
   Shevardnadze told reporters on his arrival aboard a U.S. Air
Force jet that his meeting with President Bush at the White House on
Thursday was ``a good beginning'' for the talks.
   ``We see the emergence of good prospects,'' the Soviet minister
said, although Bush said no summit was likely until near the middle
of 1990. ``We need some fresh ideas and hopefully the good fresh air
of Wyoming will help to bring them forward,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Shevardnadze, speaking to reporters after his meeting with Bush,
said, ``We have concluded that a summit is necessary. There is no
doubt about that.''
   Bush said in an ABC-TV interview Thursday night that there would
be a summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Asked whether
it would be early next year, he replied, ``I wouldn't say early.''
   A top Soviet arms control negotiator, Viktor Karpov, told
reporters that a ``deadlock'' over Star Wars strategic defenses was
blocking a proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).
   A senior U.S. official, however, later said, ``I don't think it
is correct to say there is a deadlock.''
   The Soviets want the Americans to spell out how they will adhere
to an agreement reached at the December 1987 summit that both sides
will honor the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that curbs
strategic defenses.
   Karpov, reviving an idea broached in 1988, said the Soviet Union
sought agreed guidelines on the extent to which certain weapons
could be tested in space, an idea that the United States has spurned.
   Although no START deal is expected during the Wyoming meeting,
and perhaps not for the summit next year, Baker and Shevardnadze
were expected to announce several other agreements before they fly
to New York on Sunday afternoon for a United Nations meeting:
   _Chemical weapons: The two sides reportedly are close to an
agreement to exchange information on their chemical weapons programs
and to open stockpiles and plants to inspections by the other side.
Baker and Shevardnadze hope to resolve details, including whether
U.S. chemical weapons stored in West Germany would be covered.
   _Human rights: The two sides were to issue an agreement on
expanding dialogue beyond traditional issues, such as Soviet
emigration, to new areas, including occupational safety, the
environment and criminal justice.
   _Ice curtain: An agreement was expected to allow easier visits by
Alaskan Eskimos to their distant kin in Soviet Siberia, banned since
the Kremlin blocked passage across the Bering Strait in 1948.
   Although public attention centered on arms control and prospects
for a summit, Baker and Shevardnadze began their talks aboard the
plane with a discussion of the Soviet economy and the ethnic
problems that were dealt with at a stormy Soviet Communist Party
Central Committee meeting in Moscow this week.
   Shevardnadze ``discussed mistakes that had been made in the
past'' and explained how Moscow would grant some Baltic republics
greater economic autonomy, said one senior U.S. official.

<HEAD>Residents Angry Over Plan to Rename Houston Airport After Leland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City Council members are being inundated with
calls from residents upset with a proposal to rename Houston
Intercontinental Airport after Rep. Mickey Leland, who died in a
plane crash last month.
   But Councilman Rodney Ellis, a Leland friend, said he would move
forward with the idea, which he hopes the council will consider next
week, even though most of the 50 calls his office received opposed
the name change.
   Renaming the airport ``is a fitting tribute for someone who has
served with distinction,'' Ellis said.
   Some council members said they felt torn between their desire to
honor thee congressman, whose plane crashed in Ethiopia, and to
adhere constituents' wishes.
   Councilman Larry McKaskle said he could not support the change
when his constituents were so overwhelmingly opposed. Councilman
Frank Mancuso recalled similar moves to rename the airport.
   ``Louis Macey (a former councilman) proposed to change the name
to Eisenhower Airport,'' Mancuso said. ``When Kennedy was
assassinated, they wanted to name it after him. There's going to be
an outcry over this.''
   Mancuso said a name change could be expensive because signs,
brochures and other materials would have to be reprinted.
   McKaskle and Mancuso said they would favor naming a street or
park in Leland's memory.
   In Washington, Sens. Lloyd Bentsen and Phil Gramm introduced
legislation Thursday that would name a downtown Houston federal
building after Leland.

<HEAD>Exiles Hold Inaugural Meeting of New Chinese Opposition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Refugees who fled the violent suppression of China's
pro-democracy movement joined fellow Chinese from around the world
Friday to establish a new opposition in exile aimed at continuing
the battle begun on Tiananmen Square.
   The three-day meeting of the Federation for Democracy in China,
held at the Sorbonne, opened with a moment of silence to honor those
killed June 3-4 when soldiers marched into Beijing to crush the
student-led movement. Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, died.
   ``Bringing democracy to China requires that we battle together,
shoulder to shoulder,'' said Wu'er Kaixi, the 21-year-old Beijing
University student who delivered compelling speeches in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square at the height of the spring protests. ``Our
strength continues, we are hopeful. Be confident.''
   Among those in the crowd of about 500 were photographer Henri
Cartier-Bresson, actor Yves Montand, political leaders and human
rights activists from throughout Europe and four members of Poland's
once-banned Solidarity movement, which has inspired the Chinese
group.
   ``We Poles know the cost of freedom, human rights. Fighting for
these things takes a long time,'' Solidarity member Zbigniew Chlap
told the packed university amphitheater. ``We hope that before long,
it will be possible to establish in China this Chinese Solidarity.''
   Delegates to the meeting were divided into four regional groups _
China, Europe, Asia and North America. Thirty delegates and more
than 20 observers have come from the United States.
   Prominent Chinese exiles, including former Communist Party
members, artists, intellectuals, students and business people, plan
to use the meeting to establish rules for the federation and elect
leaders.
   The group will be based in Paris with branch offices in North
America and Asia, where significant support has come from Chinese
living in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The group hopes to mobilize the
support of more than 35 million Chinese living outside their
homeland.
   Many of those involved say the federation will serve as the basis
for an effective opposition party to Communist rule in China if
conditions ever permit exiles to go home.
   Wan Runnan, one of China's most influential independent business
executives before the crackdown, said the pro-democracy movement
``has moved from an emotional stage into a more deliberative one.''
   ``The Chinese Communist Party is very organized. In order to
challenge it, we must be organized as well,'' Wan said.
   He said the movement has suffered from a lack of strategy,
organization and clear goals.
   ``We can no longer depend on reform within the system to achieve
a better China. We must form an independent party to counterbalance
the Communists. Now is the time,'' he said.
   The federation, which emphasizes that it is independent and
non-violent, will push for international economic sanctions to
intensify China's economic difficulties. With that, it hopes to
force the government toward political change.
   Wan said goals include ending one-party rule and developing a
market economy.
   Chen Yizi, an influential adviser to ousted Communist Party
leader Zhao Ziyang and the most senior official known to have
escaped after the crackdown, chaired the opening session.
   In an interview before the meeting, he said economic conditions
in China continue to deteriorate.
   Inflation in the first six months of the year ran at an annual
rate of 35 percent in the biggest cities and 28 percent nationwide,
according to Chen
   During the decade that Chen headed China's Institute for Economic
Structural Reform, one of three influential think tanks, per capita
wages rose 260 percent for peasants and 70 percent for urban workers.
   Chen _ like Wu'er, Wan and others at the meeting _ is now on
China's wanted list, accused of ``counterrevolutionary crimes.''
Zhao was ousted for sympathizing with the pro-democracy protesters.
   On Thursday in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Li
Zhaoxing called the fugitive pro-democracy leaders ``criminals'' and
said the new federation is a subversive organization.

<HEAD>American Airlines Policy Disputed by Flight Attendants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flight attendants want American Airlines to weigh
their job performance, not their bodies.
   A company policy requires overweight attendants to lose the
excess weight at a rate of 1{ pounds per week by a specified
deadline. If the attendant does not, he or she is disciplined, then
suspended and finally fired.
   Attendants say the policy is the strictest among major carriers.
They also complain the standards are based on outdated tables for
women of small or medium build, and don't take childbirth or age
into account.
   ``We want the company to change its archaic, discriminatory and
unhealthy policy,'' said Colleen Brenner, vice president of the
American Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which
represents 16,000 American employees.
   For example, under the policy, a 5-foot-2 American flight
attendant cannot weigh more than 118 pounds _ 12 pounds less than
the weight standards at Pan Am. A 5-foot-6 attendant can weigh a
maximum of 133 pounds, 22 pounds less than Pan Am.
   American spokesman Ed Stewart said the latest version of the
guidelines resulted from a federal court settlement in the 1970s. He
defended the policy as a grooming standard that is important to the
airline's image.
   The attendants filed a federal lawsuit last year that will not be
heard until 1991. Negotiations between American and the union on the
weight issue faltered about a month ago.
   The union hopes to resume negotiations with a publicity campaign
to draw attention to the dispute. Two billboards have gone up near
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport with the slogan, ``Weigh my
job performance, not my body.''
   Similar billboards are planned in New York, Chicago and Los
Angeles.

   A bomb exploded under the car of a
journalist on this Italian island Friday, damaging several vehicles
but not injuring anyone, police said.
   The car destroyed by the bomb was parked in front of the Alghero
home of Gianni Olandi, a reporter for the daily La Nuova Sardegna,
based in nearby Sassari.
   Olandi recently wrote a series of articles about building
speculation on Sardinia, a popular tourist destination. Local
officials have moved to limit construction near the island's beaches.
   Several other cars were damaged and windows of nearby buildings
were blown out by the early morning blast, police said.
   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Olandi's car was apparently targeted because of his work. No arrests
had been made, he said.

   A court bailiff with a sensitive but
faulty sniffer turned court proceedings upside down when he mistook
a lawyer's cigar for a marijuana joint.
   Lawyer Brent Ayscough was outraged Wednesday when bailiff David
Loaiza alerted a judge about smoke from a two-inch cigar stub that
Ayscough discarded while hurrying to court.
   The bailiff told Superior Court Judge Luis Cardenas the cigar
smelled like marijuana. Cardenas stopped a trial when Ayscough
demanded a police narcotics expert be called in. The expert
inspected the cigar butt, concluded there was no marijuana present,
and the trial resumed.

   The ``Voice of City Park'' is a ratings winner
at City Park Elementary School, where the news program is written
and produced by students for weekly, closed-circuit broadcast.
   Responsibility for putting the program together is rotated from
class to class. Book reviews and lunch menus have been featured
topics since the show debuted in classrooms two weeks ago.
   ``It's funny because all of the broadcasts have been good, but
they've also been very unique,'' said adviser Beth Lunsford.
   Youngsters fan out with video and audio equipment to create the
program and even use computers to produce opening and ending credits.
   The show is broadcast to classrooms on Wednesday mornings.

   Thousands of coastal residents huddled
together in emergency shelters today as Hurricane Hugo roared
outside, but some, including a congressman, ignored the governor's
orders and rode out the storm in seaside homes.
   ``I wouldn't miss it for the world,'' said Rep. Arthur Ravenel,
R-S.C., who was staying with his wife in their harbor-front home in
Mount Pleasant, five miles east of Charleston. ``I'd like to see it.
So, I'm going to stay right here and keep a diary.''
   His wife, Jean, wasn't as excited. ``We're right on the harbor,''
she said. ``But Arthur doesn't seem to think we need to board up.
He's a Lowcountry boy. So I guess he knows what he's talking
about.'' South Carolina's south coastal region is called the
Lowcountry.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell issued a mandatory evacuation for coastal
residents, but officials apparently did not forcibly move people who
wanted to stay.
   Officials said today that more than 38,000 people crowded as many
as 121 shelters throughout the state. Hotels were full as far as 270
miles inland.
   ``We came 'cause I'm scared to death of Hugo,'' said Jeanette
Hardee, who was with her husband and two children at a shelter in
Socastee, a few miles inland from Myrtle Beach. ``Our house is half
mobile home. We boarded up all the windows before we left.''
   Damage on the coastal area included roads blocked with debris and
downed power lines, mobile homes that were damaged or destroyed,
damage to waterfront buildings and structures, and boats washing
ashore.
   On Pawleys Island, south of Myrtle Beach, authorities said at
least 14 houses had been washed away. Three piers disappeared in
North Myrtle Beach, Cherry Grove, and Garden City.
   State highway patrol officials said the agency lost 32 vehicles
parked in North Charleston when the roofs of buildings fell onto
them. Also in the Charleston area, the Ben Sawyer Bridge, connecting
Mount Pleasant and Sullivan's Island, was twisted and impassable.
   Thirty major buildings in downtown Charleston were leveled,
houses collapsed all over the city, the roof caved in at a shelter
for 200 people and several people were trapped beneath a collapsed
condominium complex, said Elizabeth Tam of the Charleston County
Police. At least five people were repored dead in the Carolinas.
   Near the northern South Carolina coast at Conway High School,
evacuees continued to arrive late Thursday even after the shelter
had officially closed with 2,000 people.
   ``We tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side
doors,'' said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse.
   As the storm bore down on Charleston, some kept a sense of humor
about them.
   On plywood boards protecting the windows of the Audubon Shop and
Gallery in the historic downtown section, someone painted the sign:
``We're wild, but not as wild as Hugo.''
   Mary Emily Boggs, who was among about 700 people in Gaillard
Municipal Auditorium in downtown Charleston, said she she just
returned to the city after spending several years away.
   ``I came home the first of September and this is a heck of a
welcome,'' she said as she kept her ear to a radio for the latest
storm news.
   Maggie Burghoff, a Red Cross volunteer manning the shelter, said
Hugo was her first hurricane since moving to Charleston from St.
Louis.
   ``I'm anxious to see what it's all about,'' she said. ``We get
tornadoes out there, but of course I've never seen one of them
either.''
   State Rep. Tim Wilkes of Winnsboro, meanwhile, said he was
concerned about what the storm might do to his house on Cherry Grove
Beach, north of Myrtle Beach. He drove there Thursday, but spent
most of his time surfing.
   Police finally chased him away.
   ``I wanted to be able to tell my grandchildren that I surfed
Hugo,'' he said after three hours on the surfboard.
   In the shelters, many seemed serene about possible damage from
the hurricane.
   ``We have medicine, blankets and friends. There is nothing else
we really need,'' said Kathy Peters, who huddled with 22 family
members in a Beaufort High School shelter.
   Tony and Sanny Wartko left Hilton Head Plantation Thursday
morning and headed for Columbia, the state's capital about 115 miles
inland. They drove both of their cars and carried a Turkish rug, a
Chinese rug, their cat, and photos of their wedding and a recent
round-the-world trip.
   ``At first, we said, `We'll take this and this and this,'''
Wartko said. ``Then we saw how much we had. So we just decided to
take the personal things that can't be replaced.''
   Louise Skolfield took some photographs of her North Myrtle Beach
home, a block and a half from the ocean, ``so I'd have something to
remember my home by if it's not there when I get back.''
   In Myrtle Beach, Costa Rica resident Fernando Vega and his family
were forced to spend part of their vacation in a high school shelter.
   ``We came about 6,000 miles to get here, and look what we find,''
Vega said. ``We wanted a suntan.''
   Gov. Campbell urged people not to head back to the coast until
the storm had completely passed, and then only if they owned
property. He said about 3,200 law enforcement officers and armed
National Guardsmen would be guarding property.
   ``We're going to come down on them (looters) like a ton of
bricks,'' he said.

<HEAD>GSA Official Resigns After Security Probe Report Surfaces</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The acting No. 2 official of the General
Services Administration resigned abruptly after being told that
``adverse information'' about him had turned up in a security
investigation, GSA officials said Friday.
   The information surfaced a year ago but had been held from the
man and other top GSA officials, the GSA said.
   Richard G. Austin, acting administrator of the agency that serves
as the federal government's landlord, said David Godfrey submitted
his resignation as chief of staff on Sept. 15, effective Oct. 15.
   Austin said he had several conversations with Godfrey after
learning of information about him that had been turned up in a
security investigation.
   Dale Bruce, a GSA spokesman, said the agency's security office
had known about the information, ``or at least a portion of it,''
for a year but had not made it known to the administrator's office.
   ``I find this unacceptable,'' Austin said. He said he has ordered
two of his top assistants to ``review the process that we had in
place and ... assure that a similar situation like this doesn't
happen again.''
   Bruce described the information only as ``what we call adverse
information in his security file.'' Austin, however, said it
included ``possible substantial outstanding debts incurred in
Texas.''
   Godfrey was a Midland, Texas, banker, real estate developer and
business engaged in oil and gas operations before he became the
regional administrator for the GSA in 1987.
   A telephone call to Godfrey's office seeking comment was referred
to the agency's public affairs office.
   Bruce said security personnel apparently withheld the information
because, with the 1988 presidential election coming up, they
``thought the problem would go away and take care of itself'' as the
new administration took over.
   Bruce said the matter first came to Austin's attention about a
month ago, when Godfrey's name came up for promotion from acting
chief of staff to chief of staff. He said the acting administrator
sent the agency's general counsel and a representative of the GSA
inspector general to Texas to ``really look into the matter, and
they determined the seriousness of the problem.''
   ``The fact the information was not divulged over this period of
time is totally reprehensible,'' Bruce said.
   Sally K. Marshall, the GSA's personnel director, declined to
comment.

   Decorations and posters for a student
election and the home-opening football game still hung at Mission
High School today, but halls were empty as classmates mourned 19
students killed in a bus accident.
   Classes and extracurricular activities were canceled after
Thursday's accident, in which a school bus plunged into a
water-filled pit after being hit by a delivery truck that ran a stop
sign. Sixty-four people were injured; four remained in critical
condition today.
   ``It's very quiet here,'' said Assistant Principal Dina Chapa.
``There was no time to take anything down. ... I haven't focused on
that today. We're just trying to get on, I guess, and help out as
much as we can.
   ``What we're doing right now is collecting the personal
belongings (of the victims) from lockers and ... giving out
information, finding out when the funerals are for the students,''
Ms. Chapa said.
   The varsity game tonight against Weslaco at the school district's
Tom Landry Stadium was canceled and a memorial service was scheduled
there instead.
   ``It's a community tragedy; the whole town is crying with the
relatives of those who died,'' said the Rev. Frank Gomez, pastor of
San Martin de Porres Catholic Church, where some victims attended
Mass regularly.
   ``We're going to miss them. It'll be a sad time for the school
for a while,'' said Mission Fire Marshal Lucio S. Guerra Jr.,
fighting back tears at a community center. ``Every time they get on
the bus now, they'll remember it.''
   School board member Rosalinda Gonzalez said the reaction of
school officials was ``total awe of what had occurred, but
especially very strong sentiment for the families and what they must
be going through.''
   The district school board decided in a brief meeting after the
crash to cancel today's classes and set up crisis centers for pupils
and parents needing counseling.
   Residents of Mission and nearby Alton began offering support for
families of the victims as news of the wreck spread.
   Funds were set up for the families at First State Bank of Mission
and San Martin de Porres Catholic Church.
   At a service Thursday night, crash survivor Jesse Cuellar asked
the Iglesia Bautista del Pueblo congregation to pray for his cousin
who died in the wreck and for a neighbor who was seriously injured.
   Cuellar said when the bus first plunged into the pit, ``I just
felt like I was drowning.''
   Several of the deceased and injured were members of school
volleyball and cross country track teams, and at least one who died
_ Roman Quintero, a freshman _ was a popular football player, a
classmate said.
   ``He was real glad because he was going to play _ it was going to
be his first game,'' said Melinda Vasquez, 15, a Mission High School
student.
   But instead of football, school officials scheduled a memorial
service tonight at the stadium where the game was to have been held.
   Monette Guerrero, a seventh-grader at Mission Junior High and a
friend of several on the bus, said at first she and her classmates
didn't believe anyone they knew had been in the fatal wreck.
   ``We were at school and we were sitting there and they said it's
a tragedy _ our homeroom teachers told us,'' she said.
   Later she and her classmates learned that their friend David
Saenz was one of those killed.
   ``It hurts us just to see our friends and people we've known for
a long time _ that they won't be there anymore,'' Miss Guerrero said.

<HEAD>Bush Says Liberal Democrats Cherish Taxes.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs grafs 2, In remarks; 4, This election, and 10, Florio a
liberal Democrat, to update.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, taking a break from
foreign policy concerns to help a Republican gubernatorial
candidate, said today that liberal Democrats ``cherish new taxes
like moths drawn to a flame.''
   In a speech at fundraiser for GOP candidate Rep. Jim Courter,
Bush painted the gubernatorial contest as a choice between ``the old
and new New Jerseys.''
   He said Republican leadership would champion the environment,
education, jobs and the war on drugs, and that New Jersey's
residents should ``oppose those liberal Democrats who cherish new
taxes like moths drawn to a flame.''
   ``This election will decide whether New Jersey continues to have
the kind of leadership which balances a sound economy and sound
ecology...or whether its leadership says `no' to highter taxes and
`yes' to extending the prosperity of the last eight years,'' Bush
said.
   Organizers said the $500-a-person event raised $700,000 for
Courter's uphill fight.
   Bush interrupted his concentration on foreign affairs to appear
on Courter's behalf a day after meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze to discuss U.S.-Soviet relations. He was
beginning a four-day trip that was to culminate with a United
Nations address on Monday.
   Before leaving for New Jersey, Bush attended a ceremomny at the
Justice Department honoring that agency's 200th anniversary. Then he
took the mike on an Agriculture Department radio call-in show and
fielded questions from farm broadcasters for about 15 minutes.
   In his radio remarks, Bush reiterated his support for a reduction
in the capital gains tax, now headed for House action, saying lower
rates would greatly benefit farmers when they sell equipment or
their farms.
   ``Half of all farms sold will be eligible'' for an exclusion from
paying higher capital gains rates under the measure supported by the
administration, Bush said.
   Courter is opposed by Democratic Rep. James Florio in the contest
to succeed Republican Gov. Thomas Kean.
   Florio, a liberal Democrat who ran a close campaign in 1981
against Kean, has been given a double-digit lead over Courter in
public opinion surveys. Kean is not seeking re-election.
   The Nov. 6 election marks one of two gubernatorial races in the
nation this year. The other is in Virginia.
   Today's visit by Bush was part of a hard-fought effort to keep
the governor's seat in the Republican column, and the president was
arriving as both Florio and Courter debuted their first television
ads.
   The campaign has been marked by controversy over abortion and
homosexual issues.
   Florio favors the right to abortion, while Courter has been
accused of vacillating on the issue. He has said he personally
opposes abortion, but would not force his views on state residents.
   Courter has also rankled homosexuals by saying he supports
legislation to bar them from jobs that involve children, although he
later softened the comment by saying he would not push for such
changes in the law.
   Bush will spend the night at his vacation home in Kennebunkport,
Maine, and then take a day trip Saturday to Boston, where he will
speak to a luncheon of the Archdiocese of Boston Catholic Lawyers
Guild.
   On Monday, he will travel to New York for his first speech as
president to the United Nations General Assembly.
   Aides have been working on the speech and were expected to factor
in the results of the Shevardnadze meetings. Shevardnadze and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III headed to Wyoming on Thursday
night to continue the discussions that began at the White House.
   A range of arms control issues were on the agenda as well as
laying the groundwork for a superpower summit meeting between Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev at a yet-to-be-decided time.
   While at the United Nations, where Bush served as U.S. ambassador
in the mid-1970s, the president will meet with numerous ambassadors
and ministers as well as U.N. General Secretary Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   Bush also will host a luncheon for heads of delegations and a
reception for dignitaries on Monday evening.

   Federal and state investigators inspected a
delivery truck's brakes today to see if they could have failed
before it rolled past a stop sign and rammed a school bus into a
watery pit, killing 19 students.
   At least 64 people were injured after the bus was struck by a Dr
Pepper truck Thursday morning. Four students remained in critical
condition at hospitals this morning, including one who was
unconscious and on a respirator, officials said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board and the Texas Department
of Public Safety planned to inspect the bus and the truck throughout
the day, said DPS Sgt. Israel Pacheco.
   ``They're checking the mechanical condition of the vehicles,
particularly since the Dr Pepper truck driver was claiming that the
brakes failed,'' Pacheco said.
   Both drivers had records of traffic violations, the DPS said.
Truck driver Ruben Perez, 25, was convicted of speeding in 1987. Bus
driver Gilberto Pena, 46, was ticketed for running a red light in
March 1988, but records didn't indicate whether he was driving a
school bus at the time.
   Perez was treated and released Thursday, and Pena remained in a
hospital today in stable condition, officials said.
   The DPS said today that the number of people on the bus was 86,
including the driver, rather than 81 as previously reported. Pacheco
said several students who escaped the bus with minor injuries walked
away from the accident and were not immediately counted.
   The bus was designed to carry 83 people, said Herman Light,
quality assurance director for the manufacturer, Blue Bird Body Co.
of Fort Valley, Ga.
   Pacheco said state law allows for one student to be standing for
every student seated on the bus.
   Hidalgo County District Attorney Rene Guerra, who visited the
scene, said the case will be presented to the next grand jury.
   ``Presently, there may be some criminal negligence here,'' he
said. ``It might possibly be involuntary manslaughter if
recklessness can be attributed to the driver or the company.''
   The truck passed a state inspection last week, according to
officials at Coca-Cola Co., which owns the truck.
   NTSB spokesman David Rayburn said the investigation would include
weighing the truck and bus. The impact pushed the bus more than 40
feet.
   Investigators from the Texas attorney general's office also
probed the roadway and edge of the caliche pit, which had no fence
or railing. Caliche is the Spanish name for naturally occurring
substance often used in construction, generally made up of gravel,
sand and desert debris cemented by a porous calcium carbonate,
according to state geologist Bill Farr.
   More than 50 residents gathered at the edge of the pit until dark
Thursday, many still having trouble believing what happened.
   ``Half the school was crying,'' said Rosie Gil, 15. She said she
knew seven victims.
   Alton, population 3,000, and the larger neighboring city of
Mission, where the junior high and high school students were headed
for school, prepared to bury the first of the victims today.
   Aurora Hernandez sat with teary eyes in the lobby of Mission
Hospital Thursday afternoon, after visiting her 18-year-old
daughter, Sara Hernandez, in intensive care. Doctors, she said, were
pumping water out of Sara's lungs.
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' Alex De Leon, 18, said as he
stood in front of Mission Hospital in muddy pants and hospital
slippers, with cuts on his face and bruised hands. ``It just filled
up with water real quick.
   ``I opened up a window, took out my sister, took out a couple of
friends and it was already full of water, and you could smell the
diesel,'' he said.
   Four boats, firefighters from six departments and about 10 divers
helped in the rescue.
   ``We had to break the glass of the windows to get in,'' said Al
Nye, a diver who pulled seven bodies from the bus.
   All the dead were 12 to 18 years old, according to police.
   Students' families met with counselors and school officials at
the city's community center.
   Mike Cox, a public safety spokesman in Austin, said it was the
worst school bus accident in Texas history. The nation's worst such
accident was in 1976, when 28 Yuba City, Calif., high school
students and a teacher were killed after their bus plunged off a
freeway ramp. In 1959, 27 people were killed when a bus went into a
creek in Prestonsburg, Ky.
   Mission school Superintendent Ralph Cantu canceled classes today
and all extracurricular activities for the weekend ``because we've
had a tragedy. How can you be cheering at a football game when
something like this has happened?''
   A community memorial service was scheduled in place of the
football game tonight at the school district's Tom Landry Stadium.

   The State Department on Friday accused Panama
of engaging in widespread repression, alleging that Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega is refusing to cooperate with an Organization of
American States mandate for a human rights inspection.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the Noriega-led government
has decided not to allow the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
to visit Panama until after Nov. 1.
   This move is ``clearly designed'' to ensure that the commission's
report on Panama won't be ready for consideration by an OAS foreign
ministers meeting that convenes Nov. 13 in Washington, Boucher said.
   The OAS issued a call Aug. 23 for the commission to visit Panama
``at the earliest possible date,'' he said.
   ``While Noriega uses delaying tactics to try to minimize adverse
publicity, the human rights situation in Panama continues to be
atrocious. Basic human rights such as freedom of the press and
freedom of assembly are denied,'' Boucher said.
   ``Scores of political prisoners remain in regime jails. We and
the rest of the international community look forward to hearing the
commission's report and we will continue to press for the
restoration of human rights and democracy in Panama.''

<TEXT>
   About 25,000 activists of all
races marched Friday to protest the white-led government's policies,
and thousands of women planned to defy a government ban and hold
another rally over the weekend.
   Militant black unions launched a two-week, nationwide consumer
boycott of white-owned stores and told their 1.5 million members to
refuse to work overtime for the next four weeks.
   Union leaders said the no-overtime protest could cut industrial
production by 20 percent or force white employers to hire thousands
of additional black workers. The unions are protesting a
controversial labor law that was enacted last year despite vehement
objections from black unions.
   Some of the original, hard-line provisions of the Labor Relations
Amendment Act were modified, but unions still object to sections
that prohibit sympathy strikes, restrict the frequency of strikes
against a particular company, and make it easier for unions to be
held liable for strike-related losses.
   In Durban, South Africa's largest port and third-largest city, an
estimated 15,000 people, including members of the white city
council, joined a peaceful anti-government march to City Hall.
   Activists raised the green, black and gold banner of the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement on the flagpole at
Durban's City Hall, and police allowed it to remain during the rally.
   ``We ask (President F.W.) de Klerk and (Law and Order Minister
Adriaan) Vlok to come down from their ivory towers and join the
people,'' said Jay Naidoo, secretary-general of the 1-million-member
Congress of South African Trade Unions.
   The congress is leading the consumer boycott, along with the
National Congress of Trade Unions, which claims 500,000 black
members.
   Police raided 11 offices of the congress around the country
Friday and confiscated documents related to the boycott, the labor
federation said.
   Meanwhile, about 10,000 protesters led by the Rev. Allan Boesak
staged a similar march in Oudtshoorn, a city of about 40,000 people
300 miles east of Cape Town.
   It was by far the largest protest ever in Oudtshoorn, center of
the ostrich-farming industry and the scene of frequent
confrontations between police and activists.
   ``We're asking for trouble just to be black in a conservative
white town like this,'' Boesak said.
   But, he added, ``It's just about time that places like this take
notice of the fact that the march for freedom has begun and nobody,
not even Oudtshoorn, will turn us around.''
   After a 5.5-mile march, the protesters presented police with a
list of demands, including a halt to alleged harassment of activists.
   A coalition of anti-apartheid women's groups vowed to ignore a
government ban and proceed with a march Saturday on government
headquarters in Pretoria.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said the government obtained a
court injunction to stop the march because organizers did not apply
for approval. Two white supremacist groups sought and received
permission to hold rallies Saturday in Pretoria.
   The government, for the first time in decades, has allowed
several protest marches this month and says it will not disrupt
peaceful demonstrations that have been authorized in advance.
   Naidoo and other union leaders urged all blacks to join the
consumer boycott, which they said was part of a broadbased national
defiance campaign launched in early August.
   There was no immediate word from retail organizations about the
extent of the boycott.
   However, department stores in the southern cities of East London
and King William's Town, where the boycott began early, were
reported virtually deserted Thursday.
   The defiance campaign has included protests of segregation laws
as well as marches in several cities.
   The marches had been peaceful until Thursday, when some black
youths smashed windows of shops and vehicles in the southeastern
city of Pietermaritzburg.
   No injuries and only one arrest were reported, but pro-government
media gave headline treatment to the incident.
   The government said Friday that organizers of protest marches
must request permission at least seven days in advance. Leaders of
most of the recent marches have refused to seek a permit, but the
government approved them anyway.

   President Bush cleared the way Friday for the
distribution of federal disaster relief money for some mainland
areas devastated by Hurricane Hugo, approving a request for aid by
South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell Jr.
   The federal assistance, coordinated by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, will included money to help states clear roads,
restore power and other essentials as well provide low-interest
loans _ and in some cases grants _ for repairs.
   Much of the water damage to residences is covered by federal
flood insurance held by many people who live in low coastal areas,
although FEMA officals said not all people have such insurance. Wind
damage normally is covered by homeowners insurance, they noted.
   ``South Carolina has a lot of damage, but the infastructure is
going to come up pretty quickly,'' Grant Peterson, associate
director of FEMA, told a news conference.
   Peterson, who has been in touch with state officials affected by
the hurricane, praised local authorities for evacuating most people
along the shoreline hit by Hugo.
   ``Their actions have saved literally hundreds of lives,'' he said.
   Bush signed the disaster declaration for South Carolina even as
the extent of the destruction remained unclear. Similar requests for
federal assistance were expected from other states affected.
   Peterson said he had not yet received a detailed assessment of
damages along the South Carolina coast where Hugo roared ashore, but
said it already is clear ``this hurricane is going to be ...
expensive.''
   As Hugo turned northward Friday after coming ashore in the
Charleston, S.C., area, federal relief officials were continuing
their efforts to help the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, which had
been pummeled by the storm earlier in the week.
   ``St. Croix (in the Virgin Islands) is devastated, absolutely
devastated,'' said Peterson. He detailed the difficulties relief
officials have had in restoring electrical power to the island,
saying that 90 percent of the power polls have been toppled and the
generating plant ``itself is in jeopardy.''
   Bush earlier this week declared both the Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico as disaster areas, making them eligible for federal
assistance. Peterson said that $14.3 million has been earmarked for
St. Croix and St. Thomas and $11 million for Puerto Rico.
   As part of the relief activities still under way, according to
FEMA officials, military transports on Friday were airlifting to the
islands:
   _Four 750 killowatt generators for St. Croix to restore
electrical power and two mobile air traffic control facilities to
the island's airport so it can be reopened for commercial service.
   _More than 8,000 blankets donated by the Red Cross, basic medical
supplies, and 600 rolls of plastic sheeting for temporary roofing on
damaged buildings.
   _A shipment of 100,000 ready-to-eat meals with more expected to
be shipped later.
   Earlier this week, Bush directed the military to help local
officials restore order on St. Croix, where there had been
widespread looting.
   Peterson, meanwhile, said FEMA's disaster relief fund is down to
about $40 million. But, he said Congress has appropriated $100
million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and if that's not
enough the agency will go to Capitol Hill and ask for more.

   Jingjing, a giant panda at the Chengdu Zoo, has
given birth to twins after being artificially inseminated, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported Friday.
   It was the second birth this year among China's captive pandas,
making it a banner year. The rare black-and-white animals, whose
numbers have dropped sharply in the wild to about 1,000, do not
breed readily in captivity.
   Xinhua said Jingjing's cubs, born Thursday, weigh 3.5 ounces
each. It gave no other details about them.
   Pandas refuse to nurse more than one cub at a time, so staff at
the zoo in southwestern China are nursing the second cub, Xinhua
said.
   Jingjing bore her first cub in 1987. The two latest were the
products of insemination with frozen semen, Xinhua said, a technique
that Chinese scientists favor.
   The Fuzhou Zoo in eastern China reported the birth of a cub in
June but did not say how the mother, Qingqing, was inseminated.
   Official tallies of the number of pandas in captivity in China
vary widely, but recent reports put the figure at more than 80.
Another panda in Chengdu's zoo, Meimei, has been given the title
``hero mother'' for bearing nine cubs since 1980. Six have survived.

<HEAD>Housing Shortage Hits Vail Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VAIL, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rental housing is so scarce in Vail these days
that Mayor Kent Rose says he may be forced to resign and move.
   Rose's predicament is a glaring example of what some are calling
the worst housing crunch ever in Vail. With more than 5,000 seasonal
employees expected to arrive in the next two months, virtually no
rental properties are available.
   ``I'd like to stay in town and continue what I'm doing,'' said
Rose, a structural engineer. ``I've got two more years left on the
council. But, deeper than that, I`ve been here for about 18 years
now and would like to be able to live in the community that I've
invested in. This is really hard.''
   Rose learned just before Labor Day that the townhouse he has
rented for more than a year is up for sale.
   Unwilling to risk having to find a new home during the ski season
when rental property is next to impossible to find, Rose gave
himself until the end of this month to find a home for his family.
   If he doesn't find a place, Rose said he may have to look for
housing outside Vail, which would force him to resign as mayor.
   According to some property managers, rental costs have risen by
10 percent to 20 percent during the past year. And although there
are tiny efficiency apartments that rent for $400 to $600, the
average rent for a two-bedroom condominium runs closer to $800 or
$900.
   ``I don't know if (the seasonal workers) are going to find a
place to live,'' Rose said. ``I guess the old cord-wood theory
applies _ stack them in as tight as you can get them.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer
flies to New York next week to address the United Nations and is
hoping the visit also will heal the rift between his anti-nuclear
nation and the United States.
   New Zealanders feel the diplomatic cold shoulder they have been
given by successive U.S. administrations has gone on too long since
they banned American warships from their ports in 1984.
   Foreign Minister Russell Marshall told reporters Palmer's trip
could prove the catalyst to let New Zealand out of the ``diplomatic
sin bin.''
   Almost every other country in the world except Libya, Iran, North
Korea and New Zealand have access to top levels of the U.S.
administration, he complained.
   In an interview this week, Palmer said he will not seek
appointments with U.S. officials but sent a clear signal that
unofficial contacts would be welcome.
   ``As part of the process of meeting various people at the United
Nations, obviously I will be having bilateral talks with a number of
different government officials,'' he said, adding he would meet any
Americans ``if they seek a meeting with me.''
   But Palmer said he is not disposed ``to go cap in hand'' seeking
higher-level access in Washington.
   ``The American administration has not warmed to our policy of
nuclear-free New Zealand,'' he said. ``They have decided the ANZUS
(Australia, New Zealand, U.S. military) alliance should be
inoperative as a result of that policy ...
   ``I think they have really locked themselves into a position they
can't easily retreat from. But we accept their position.''
   Palmer, 47, once emigrated to the United States. He lived there
for six years, graduated in law from the University of Chicago and
was professor of law at the University of Iowa and University of
Virginia. He has a son studying law at Yale and will visit him there
during his four-day stay starting Oct. 2.
   ``We've got many shared democratic values, free speech and common
attitudes on a lot of international issues,'' Palmer said of the two
countries. ``I'm very fond of the United States. I love its
diversity and its pluralism and its commitment to free speech. I
always quote to Americans when they talk about our nuclear policy,
the words of Patrick Henry: `Give me Liberty or give me death.'''
   New Zealand banned U.S. warships because Washington refuses to
confirm or deny whether they carry atomic weapons.
   Palmer said he will address the General Assembly on the dangers
of driftnet fishing in the Pacific, a matter on which he thinks New
Zealand and the United States have a common interest.
   He said he would be speaking for small island states of the
Southwest Pacific whose stability, economies and environment are
threatened.
   Japanese and Taiwanese trawlers set nets up to 30 miles long that
are ``environmentally disastrous'' catching ``whales, seals, birds,
everything,'' he said.
   Drift net fishing is depleting tuna and salmon stocks, a matter
of concern to Americans and Canadians, he said.
   ``President Bush's attitude to environmental issues encourages me
a great deal,'' said Palmer. ``I welcome the greening of America, if
I can put it that way.''

   The daughter of former Teamster leader Jimmy
Hoffa says she was shocked by a magazine article about how her
father was killed and dismembered, but she doubts the story is true.
   ``It's terribly gory. It's terribly upsetting to the entire
family,'' Barbara Ann Crancer said after reading an advance of the
article in Playboy. ``It's a hame we had to read it in a
Playboy-type magazine.''
   A federally protected witness, Donald ``Tony the Greek'' Frankos,
told Playboy that Hoffa, who disappeared July 30, 1975, in suburban
Detroit, was shot, dismembered and buried in concrete at Giants
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
   Crancer said she assumed that if the FBI had information such as
that revealed by Frankos to Playboy, his family would have been
notified.
   Crancer, who is an administrative law judge for the Missouri
Division of Workers Compensation, has sued the Justice Department
for release of the FBI's file on her father. No trial date has been
set.

<TEXT>
   A pair of 10-cent stamps found on a
142-year-old letter are among the first U.S. stamps issued and could
be worth as much as $1 million, collectors said.
   The Philatelic Foundation, a non-profit stamp-authentication
agency based in New York, has certified that a 142-year-old envelope
mailed to the Marion County clerk on July 2, 1847, is the earliest
known use of a U.S. stamp.
   ``The discovery of this historic rarity was the stuff philatelic
lore is made of and rivaled the greatest finds in the history of
stamp collecting,'' the foundation said in a statement.
   ``It may well be the closest philatelists will get to an actual
first-day cover,'' foundation chairman Roberto M. Rosende said.
   The two black stamps, which picture George Washington, are known
to collectors as U.S. 2 and first were issued on July 1, 1847, in
New York. They were among the first U.S. stamps issued to
postmasters to replace hand-inked impressions as proof of postage
paid.
   The stamps and their envelope are major assets of the estates of
two Indianapolis men, Delmere B. Blackburn and Dr. Harry D. Mark.
Blackburn died in April 1987 and Mark died last month. Both estates
are pending in the probate division of Marion Superior Court.
   The two men shared ownership of the rarities, which they
discovered in some books they had purchased at the estate sale in
the late 1960s of Indianapolis lawyer John W. Becker.
   The stamps will be sold through a national dealer, said John F.
Sullivan Jr., an attorney representing one of the estates.
   ``Obviously, the price will be whatever a willing buyer will pay,
but we think it could be worth $1 million,'' he said.
   Stamp experts, including Eric Scott, part owner of The Stamp Shop
in Indianapolis, believe Sullivan's estimate is excessive. Some say
the envelope could bring as much as $200,000.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner today
told the new owners of Northwest Airlines his decision on the
department's fitness review of the airline, a department spokesman
said. But an announcement was not due until next week.
   Skinner has the option of pulling the airline's operating
license, but there has been no indication that this is likely.
   Transportation Department spokesman Hal Paris said a decision has
been made in the department's review of the takeover by Wings
Holdings Ltd. of Northwest's parent company, NWA, Inc. He said
Skinner met this morning with California investor Alfred Checchi,
who heads Wings.
   Paris said results of the department's fitness review of the $4
billion takeover would likely be made public next week.
   He said the department's public affairs office had been given no
details of the meeting but Skinner would have told Checchi whether
any restrictions might be put on the airline's operating license
because of the buyout.
   Paris, said conditions could include requiring the airline to
furnish regular financial reports and putting restrictions on the
carrier's management.
   Skinner informed Checchi of his decision before making it public
because he ``didn't want Mr. Checchi reading about (the findings) in
the paper,'' the spokesman said.
   Checchi led a group including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines that
agreed in June to pay $121 a share for NWA. Northwest is the
nation's fourth-largest airline.
   Skinner has expressed concern about leverage buyouts and
increasing foreign investment in U.S. airlines. The Checchi takeover
saddles Northwest with $3.1 billion in debt.
   Without mentioning Northwest, Skinner said in a speech to the
International Aviation Club Tuesday that he would make adjustments
in a heavily leveraged airline's operating certificate if necessary
to protect the public interest.
   ``Or, if absolutely necessary,'' he added, ``and I hope that
doesn't take place, we will revoke the certificate.''
   The Justice Department also investigated the Northwest sale but
did not raise any objections, said spokeswoman Amy Brown.
   The department's review was prompted by antitrust issues raised
by KLM's interest in the sale, Brown said.

   The pilot and co-pilot of a jetliner that
careened into the East River had their licenses suspended and have
agreed to be interviewed by investigators, who hope they can explain
why they aborted their takeoff, federal officials said today.
   Information recovered from flight data and cockpit voice
recorders failed to explain the crash, which killed two women
passengers, officials said. There were reports of the pilot
vanishing and the co-pilot claiming his colleague had been acting
irrationally.
   Spokesmen for both the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday that they did not
know where the cockpit crew went after their USAir Boeing 737 ran
off a runway at LaGuardia Airport late Wednesday.
   But a spokesman for the NTSB, which is running the investigation,
said today that the absence of the pilot and co-pilot was not
unusual and had not hampered the probe.
   ``It's not at all unusual for us not to interview a pilot on the
same day as the accident,'' spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said. In this
case, he said, investigators arranged on Thursday afternoon through
the pilots' union and the airline to interview the pilots.
   Pilot Michael Martin and co-pilot Constantine Kleissaf have the
right to decline NTSB interviews, but if they do, the NTSB can
subpoena them, said Rachel Halterman, an NTSB spokeswoman.
   ``We've tried to contact him but we have not been able to do
so,'' Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said Thursday.
   He added: ``There was no indication of why he was aborting. Until
we know why the guy aborted the takeoff, we have no way of knowing
the cause of the accident.''
   Farrar said today that the two had their licenses suspended, and
would have to go through a recertification procedure before they
could fly again. He said he did not know if the license suspension
was for the crash or for not being available after the crash.
   The tail section of the jet was lifted from the water this
morning, the Port Authority said.
   The crash of Flight 5050 late Wednesday split the fuselage of the
plane, which was headed for Charlotte, N.C. The tail of the plane
was partly submerged 10 feet from the runway while the nose skidded
onto a trestle in the river that held runway lights.
   Of the 59 survivors, including all six crew members, 45 people
were treated at hospitals and eight remained hospitalized as of
Thursday, according to USAir.
   Local law-enforcement officials were probing reports that the
co-pilot told Port Authority police shortly after the crash that the
pilot was behaving oddly in the cockpit.
   ``We suspect (Martin's) behavior may have played a part in the
accident,'' a law enforcement source said.
   Investigators quoted Kleissaf, 29, as saying that he was at the
controls of the jetliner as it roared down the runway and that
Martin started ``mumbling and acting irrationally,'' newspapers
reported today.
   The New York Times said the co-pilot gave his report to Port
Authority police, but Port Authority spokesman John Hughes said he
knew of no interviews that agency police had with the crew.
   USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny declined to discuss any possible
causes of the crash, saying the NTSB had jurisdiction.
   ``The captain is taking advice of his own counsel,'' Colodny said
at a news conference.
   Farrar said it was unclear whether the pilot or co-pilot was at
the controls during the crash.
   ``We've tried to contact (the pilot) but we have not been able to
do so,'' said Farrar. ``There was no indication of why he was
aborting. Until we know why the guy aborted the takeoff, we have no
way of knowing the cause of the accident.''
   The cockpit recorder had ``no noises or voices that suggested
there was any problem with the takeoff or why the takeoff was
aborted,'' said James Kolstad, acting chairman of the NTSB.
   The flight data show the plane swerved slightly instead of moving
straight down the runway and showed some ``deviations'' in rudder
movement, Kolstad said, but it was not immediately clear how that
might have affected takeoff.
   The pilot had flown 737s for only two months and the co-pilot was
in a 737 cockpit crew for the first time, the Times reported,
quoting airline industry officials.
   Officials said whoever was at the controls of the plane radioed
the control tower that he was aborting takeoff moments before the
jet slid into the East River.
   Survivors clung to the wings of the broken aircraft or grasped
driftwood after the plane slid into the water.
   ``The pilot seemed to be accelerating but didn't have enough
power to get the plane up,'' passenger Larry Martin said. ``He put
on the brakes. The plane took a dip and the next thing I knew all
hell broke loose.''
   Stunned passengers scrambled out doors and onto wings. Some
escaped down an emergency chute and found themselves in about 25
feet of water.
   Flight attendants threw them seat cushions, which are designed to
float.
   Police scuba divers freed some 15 people from the cabin, while
rescuers in boats scooped people from the water and wings.
   ``We just grabbed on to a big piece of wood and held on for dear
life,'' said passenger Tom Newberry, 27, who was heading to North
Carolina to be married Saturday.
   Police said the two passengers killed were Betsy Brogan, 37, of
Gray, Tenn., and her mother-in-law, Alyce Brogan, 69, of Vixton, Va.
   Port Authority officials said light rain at the time of the crash
was not a factor. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
operates the airport.
   The plane was delivered in January and had no history of
mechanical problems, USAir spokeswoman Nancy Vaughan said.
   In June, the FAA ordered most Boeing 737-400s grounded because of
two incidents in which engines failed. Airlines were ordered to
replace certain engine parts.

   A deer wandered into a subway tunnel and
delayed thousands of commuters for 1{ hours Friday morning, and
police later shot the animal after it was hit by a train.
   The deer was about a mile and a half into the 3\-mile-long
Berkeley Hills tunnel that carries BART commuters between Concord
and Daly City, said Bay Area Rapid Transit System spokesman Sy
Mouber.
   The deer was first spotted at 7 a.m. by a Daly City-bound train.
A 7:38 a.m. train then hit the deer, leading BART officials to
believe the animal had left.
   But a 7:56 a.m. train again spotted the deer up and running in
the tunnel. BART officials cut off power on the tunnel line shortly
after 9 a.m. and began working to remove the deer. Trains moved on
only one track, causing delays because trains had to move in both
directions.
   BART police shot the deer because it was injured and officials
believed it could threaten workers, Mouber said.

   A convicted swindler who nearly succeeded in
taking $69 million from a bank is now charged with trying to pay a
jail guard $70,000 to help him escape.
   Armand Moore was back in court Thursday, a day after a federal
judge sentenced him to 10 years in prison for the illegal transfer
of $69 million from the First National Bank of Chicago.
   Moore was arraigned Thursday on a charge of conspiring to escape.
   Prosecutors said on Wednesday, Moore's stepsister, working as a
government informant, turned over $20,000 in FBI money to Stephanie
Glass, 25. She is the wife of Randy Glass, a 28-year-old guard at
the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where Moore is being held.
   The money was a downpayment to assure Glass' help in the planned
escape, the government said. After the woman accepted the money, she
and her husband were arrested.

<HEAD>Governor Orders Clinic Closed, Seeks New Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez on Friday ordered an
abortion clinic closed following reports of botched abortions and
directed a state agency to come up with tougher rules to protect
women at private clinics.
   Martinez denied he was using the situation to enact emergency
regulations on abortion just weeks before the Legislature takes up
the issue in special session.
   ``This is a pure pro-health issue,'' Martinez said. ``This is for
the health of individuals irregardless of philosophy on the
substance of the abortion issue.''
   Yet in a letter to Health and Rehabilitative Services Secretary
Greg Coler, the Republican governor said conditions at the Miami
clinic ``are precisely why I have called for increased regulation of
abortion clinics to protect the health of women.''
   Martinez told Coler to begin steps to revoke the license of the
Women's Service Center following a report in The Miami Herald about
improper abortions by unlicensed physicians resulting in ruptured
uteri and hysterectomies.
   ``There is no legal reason, no health reason, for this order,''
said Susan Hoffman, director of the center. ``We've done nothing
against the law. We've helped thousands of women. I see this as
totally ludicrous.''
   She said she had received no official notice from the agency on a
license revocation.
   Peter Dunbar, the governor's general counsel, said any emergency
regulations would be in effect for 90 days. After that, the rules
would be subject to public hearings and Health and Rehabilitative
Services board approval to become permanent.
   By that time, the Legislature will have decided whether to go
along with Martinez's proposals to further restrict access to
abortions. The session is scheduled for Oct. 10-13.
   Neither Martinez nor Dunbar would be specific about the kinds of
regulations being sought. But both said they would be designed to
protect the health of women seeking abortions, not to restrict their
access to an abortion at any of the 47 licensed private clinics in
the state.
   ``We're going to look at creatively working under the authority
of the existing statute and do as much as we can to fit that,''
Dunbar said.
   A pro-choice Republican legislator, Rep. Carol Hanson, said she
supports the governor's action as long as it is not extreme.
   ``There's a whole conglomeration of standards that ... we could
live with. We owe it to our sisters around the state to have safe
abortions,'' she said. ``We think abortion should remain legal, but
they should also be safe.''

   A judge wept as he sentenced a man to the
maximum term in prison for shooting a 7-year-old boy during a drug
dispute.
   Lonnie Summers, 22, was sentenced to 12{ to 15 years on Thursday
by Common Pleas Judge Marvin R. Halbert. Summers also was ordered to
pay $500,000 in restitution, a $25,000 fine and $2,000 in court
costs.
   Summers was convicted last December of wounding Ralph Brooks Jr.
during a drug shootout in south Philadelphia. The boy, who had been
playing in his grandparents' yard, was left paralyzed from the waist
down by a .45-caliber bullet that severed his spine.
   Halbert dabbed his eyes with a tissue several times while reading
statements written by Kimberly Brooks, the boy's mother, and Barbara
White, Ralph's grandmother, on the costs of the child's medical
treatment and the emotional trauma. The judge's shoulders heaved
slightly as he spoke.
   Tears rolled down Assistant District Attorney Rayford Means' face
as he described the effect the shooting has had on the child's life
and his family.
   ``He will never experience dancing with a date at a prom or
walking his girlfriend home or playing baseball,'' Means said. ``Not
only is Ralph Brooks Jr. living a miserable life, so is his family.''
   The boy undergoes therapy once a week and must be turned at least
every three hours while he sleeps, Means said.
   During the hearing, Means produced witnesses who said the
neighborhood where the Brooks family lives has become a safer,
cleaner environment since the shooting. The children's neighborhood
playground has been renamed in honor of the 7-year-old.
   Referring to that testimony, Summers' lawyer, Eugene Tinari, said
afterward his client has been made a ``scapegoat'' in the city's war
on drugs.
   ``The prosecution is saying now that we have him, that is the end
of the problem,'' Tinari said.
   Tinari said he will file a motion within 10 days asking for a
reduction in sentence.
   The child's parents, Kimberly and Ralph Sr., who sat two rows
behind Summers during the proceedings, shied away from cameras.
Ralph was in school, Mrs. White said.

<HEAD>Glemp Says `Significant Progress' Made in Convent Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, leader of the
country's Roman Catholic Church, on Friday announced ``significant
progress'' toward ending the dispute over a convent at Auschwitz.
   His remarks came one day after Jewish leaders in London reported
Glemp agreed in a letter to move the convent from the perimeter of
the former Nazi death camp in southern Poland. On Tuesday, the
Vatican issued a statement saying it should be moved.
   On his return from London on Friday, Glemp spoke to reporters and
briefly praised British Jewish leaders for their ``calm'' approach
to the controversy.
   ``That is why there is significant progress (that) ... will
influence positively the conclusion of this argument,'' he said.
   He did not refer to the London letter, and reporters did not ask
him about it. However, he said: ``We understand better what it means
in the Jewish sense to respect a place that is sacred.''
   Glemp noted Jews and Christians have different traditions about
cemeteries, with Christians more likely to put places of worship at
burial grounds.
   The primate had opposed moving the convent despite an agreement
between Catholic cardinals and Jewish leaders that the Carmelite
nuns would be moved to an interfaith cultural center away from the
camp. The center has not been built.
   Although the Polish church has made no official statement, all
indications were that Glemp bowed to the wishes of Polish-born Pope
John Paul II and will no longer oppose the move.
   Stefan Wilkanowicz, acting as a mediator in the conflict on
behalf of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said Thursday night
that the decision to move the convent had been settled.
   The convent angered many Jews who suspect the Catholic church of
trying to insert itself into what they regard as a Jewish
catastrophe. Of the 4 million who died at Auschwitz, 2.5 million
were Jews.
   The Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza Friday published for the
first time in Poland a 1987 agreement in which the church originally
agreed to move the convent. It also published the text of the
Vatican statement, which had not been prominently carried by state
media.
   Auschwitz could be considered ``the biggest cemetery in the
history of the Jewish nation,'' the newspaper said.
   The church failed to meet a Feb. 22 deadline to relocate the
nuns. That deadline was in the 1987 agreement signed in Geneva by
Jewish leaders and Archbishop Franciszek Macharski of Krakow.
   After protests, Macharski last month said the 1987 commitment
could not be fulfilled because of the ``aggressive'' atmosphere.
   The Glemp letter was made public in London by Sir Sigmund
Sternberg, a philanthropist who heads the International Council of
Christians and Jews. Glemp handed the letter to Sternberg at a
dinner at the Polish Embassy in London on Tuesday.
   It said: ``It is essential not only to move the convent outside
the perimeter of the site, but also to set up the new cultural
center.''
   Shimon Cohen, a spokesman for the chief rabbi of Britain, Lord
Immanuel Jakobovits, said the letter ``will undoubtedly be a
substantial contribution to restoring Catholic-Jewish harmony.''

   President Bush, trying to help
Republicans score a come-from-behind victory in the New Jersey
governor's race, portrayed Democrats on Friday as soft on crime,
eager to raise taxes and champions of ``the failed policies'' of the
1970s.
   In a sharply partisan speech, Bush said there was a lot at stake
in the Nov. 7 election: ``The future versus the past. Policies that
work versus policies that don't. A better future for our children,
or one of lost opportunity.''
   The race, one of two governor's contests this year, pits
Republican Rep. Jim Courter against Democrat James Florio to succeed
GOP Gov. Thomas Kean. The other gubernatorial contest is in Virginia.
   ``I am the underdog in this race,'' Courter said, acknowleging he
trails Florio in public opinion polls.
   Florio, a liberal Democrat, ran a close race against Kean in
1981. The governor is not seeking re-election.
   ``The failed policies ... of the 1970s just aren't good enough,''
Bush said. ``Not for New Jersey, not for the United States of
America. They're not good enough to tackle drugs or crime. Or to
protect the environment or do better as a nation in education.
They're not good enough for our kids.''
   Bush campaigned for Courter at a state Republican fund-raising
luncheon before flying to Maine for a weekend at his seaside
compound in Kennebunkport.
   Before settling in at his vacation home, Bush planned to make a
brief stop at a tree farm in nearby Wells to make a new pitch in his
campaign for a reduction in capital gains taxes, which are imposed
on profits from sales of real estate, stocks and other assets.
   Bush using a tree farm to advance his campaign for a capital
gains tax cut because tree farmers must pay capital gains tax on
profits from their sales.
   That's because trees are considered tangible assets, rather than
merchandise.
   The administration contends that many tree farms are small,
marginal operations. Before 1986 tax reform act, tree farmers could
pay the then-lower rate on capital gains and make a go of it. Now,
with the higher rates, many are going bankrupt, the administration
contends.
   Bush told the GOP fund-raiser that he rejected Democrats' charges
that his plan was a tax break for the rich. ``It is a tax adjustment
that is going to create jobs in America and that is why I am going
to continue to fight for it.''
   Bush will make a three-hour excursion Saturday to speak a
luncheon of the Archdiocese of Boston Catholic Lawyers Guild.
   On Monday, he will travel to New York for his first speech as
president to the United Nations General Assembly. He will return to
Washington late that night after hosting a reception and dinner for
U.N. dignataries.
   Sponsors said the New Jersey luncheon raised $700,000 for the
GOP, Bush told the audience.
   In New Jersey, Bush told Republicans, ``This election will decide
whether New Jersey builds on what you began eight years ago or
whether it risks everything by returning to the past, whether New
Jersey has the inspired leadership it needs to win the war on drugs
and crime, or whether it reverts to failed social policies that
blame everyone but the criminal.
   ``This election will decide whether New Jersey continues to have
the kind of leadership which balances a sound economy and a sound
ecology ... or whether its leadership says `No' to higher taxes and
`Yes' to extending the prosperity of the last eight years,'' Bush
said.
   He said Republican leadership would champion the environment,
education, jobs and the war on drugs, and that New Jersey's
residents should ``oppose those liberal Democrats who cherish new
taxes like moths drawn to some kind of a candle.''
   ``The old New Jersey's attitude was: If one tax didn't work, try
another one,'' he said.
   The gubernatorial campaign has been marked by controversy over
abortion and homosexual issues.
   Florio favors the right to abortion, while Courter has been
accused of vacillating on the issue. He has said he personally
opposes abortion, but would not force his views on state residents.
   Courter has also angered homosexuals by saying he supports laws
to bar them from jobs that involve children, although he later
softened the comment by saying he would not push for such changes.

<HEAD>Christian Leader Accepts Arab Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun on
Friday accepted an Arab peace plan aimed at ending a blood bath
between his forces and Syrian troops that has claimed almost 1,000
lives in the past six months.
   ``We declare to our people, all our people in the liberated as
well as the (Syrian-) occupied areas, that September 23rd is the
beginning of the chance to achieve peace,'' Aoun said in a
two-minute television address.
   Syria, which controls 70 percent of Lebanon, and its Lebanese
allies have already accepted the Arab League plan.
   Aoun said he agreed to the Arab League plan, which begins with a
cease-fire, after ``appeals from the international community, all
the Arabs and all the friends, and in line with the Lebanese
people's desire.''
   Immediately after Aoun spoke, a television announcer reported
that two mortar rounds had crashed into a Christian army position
above Beirut, but they caused no casualties or damage.
   Several previous cease-fires called by the Arab League have
failed to end the fighting, and Aoun has blamed the violations on
the Syrians.
   The shrunken population of Beirut appeared to take the call for
peace seriously. Many citizens took to the streets and began firing
guns in the air in a traditional expression of joy.
   Others drove through streets blanketed with debris, honking their
car horns.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said, ``We hope that this will result quickly in a cease-fire by all
the parties to the conflict.''
   Aoun conveyed his acceptance of the plan to Arab League envoy
Lakhdar Ibrahimi during a meeting in his bunker-office under the
bomb-ravaged presidential palace.
   After the 40-minute meeting, Aoun told reporters: ``We wish
success to the peace plan. We've given peace a chance and, God
willing, there will be peace.''
   ``The results will be positive if the intentions are sincere. If
not, we reserve the right to take proper decisions at the proper
time,'' he said.
   Ibrahimi, assistant secretary-general of the 22-member Arab
League, said after his meeting with Aoun that the Lebanese ``as of
now, will be able to reopen their shops, go to schools and return to
their homes.'' About 90 percent of Beirut's 1.5 million people have
fled the city.
   Ibrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, was asked by an Arab League
committee to head a security committee to supervise the cease-fire
and monitor ships to ensure that no weapons reach Lebanese factions.
   Aoun initially said he would not send a representative to such a
committee because it did not include a Syrian member. Aoun saw that
as submitting to Syria's efforts to portray the crisis as one among
Lebanese factions, even though Syrian forces in Lebanon are the main
opponent of the Christians.
   But France and the United States, traditional backers of the
Christians, and several Arab governments voiced support for the
peace plan and urged Aoun to be flexible to avoid further bloodshed.
   Ibrahimi arrived in Beirut on Sunday, a day after the peace plan
was announced by the Arab committee.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads a
Syrian-backed Cabinet vying for legitimacy with Aoun's Christian
government, and Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite
Moslem, have accepted the plan.
   Shiite militia cheiftain Nabih Berri and Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt _ Syria's main allies in Lebanon _ also endorsed it.
   The plan's first six points focus on the cease-fire and steps to
enforce it. They include a call for the lifting of blockades on
ports and the country's only international airport, a halt in
weapons imports and propaganda campaigns and a plea to foreign
countries to stop the flow of arms and ammunition to Lebanon.
   The last clause calls for a meeting of the 99-seat Parliament on
Sept. 30, outide Lebanon, to discuss political reforms to statisfy
Moslem demands for an equal share of power with the Christians.
   Christians have dominated the government, legislature, army and
judiciary since independence from France in 1943, when they were the
majority.
   Moslems are now believed to make up 55 percent of the population
of 4 million, even though there has been no official census since
1932.
   Aoun has complained that the Arab plan makes no reference to a
Syrian withdrawal from the country, and Ibrahimi made no reference
to that in his statement.
   The Syrians maintain 40,000 troops in Moslem regions under a 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Before Ibrahimi's meeting with Aoun, police reported that two
people were killed and seven wounded in artillery and rockets duels
in and around Beirut overnight.
   That brought the overall toll to 929 killed and 2,738 wounded
since the Christian-Syrian confrontation erupted March 8. It has
developed into one of the most destructive rounds of violence since
the civil war broke out in April 1975.

<TEXT>
   The rush of ethnic Germans from Eastern
Europe promises greater wealth, a baby boom, stable taxes and a
steady work force to power West Germany's economy, a study released
Friday predicts.
   The government-commissioned study, from the German Economics
Institute, warned of short-term problems including higher
unemployment and housing shortages but said positive economic
effects should be felt by 1993.
   West Germany already enjoys one of the world's most vibrant
economies, and experts now speak of a second ``Wirtschaftswunder'' _
the postwar economic miracle that built an industrial giant from the
rubble of the Third Reich.
   Immigrant contributions to the gross national product, a measure
of national wealth, could be as high as $79 billion by the year
2000, the Cologne-based institute said.
   Its nearly 400-page report carefully skirted consideration of how
the picture would change if the two German states were reunited or
if the recent stream of refugees were to continue or accelerate.
   Government spokesman Hans Klein told reporters that 235,000
ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union, Poland and other East bloc
nations have arrived in West Germany this year _ more than in all of
1988. In addition, more than 100,000 East Germans have escaped or
emigrated to West Germany.
   Because Bonn recognizes East Germans as citizens, they are not
counted as ``immigrants'' with other ethnic Germans arriving from
abroad.
   Some government officials predict as many as 500,000 ethnic
Germans will arrive by year's end.
   Klein described the stream as ``a great and multifaceted gain.''
   But he reiterated ``it is not the political goal of this
government that all ethnic Germans from abroad come to us.''
   Bonn officials have been pressing East European leaderships to
work toward improvements to make life better for ethnic Germans
abroad.
   While East Germans are a minority among ethnic Germans migrating
to West Germany, attention has focused on them because of Hungary's
decision to open its border with Austria and thereby provide an
escape route to the West.
   About 18,500 East Germans have fled through Hungary to West
Germany since Sept. 10. At least another 7,000 escaped illegally
through Hungary in the weeks leading up to the mass release.
   The economic report predicted the influx of East Europeans,
excluding East Germans, would fall between 2 million and 3.5 million
over the next 10 years.
   It said 14 million immigrants, refugees and exiles of German
origin have come to West Germany since the end of World War II.
   They account for more than a quarter of West Germany's population
of 61 million.
   Institute director Otto Vogel said, ``The immigrants bring with
them middle- and long-term improvements for growth and well-being, a
stronger public financial picture, stabilization of the social
security system, a rejuvenation of the population, urgent relief of
manual labor shortages and in general a more flexible job market.''

   More than 7,000 tons of U.S.-donated food has
arrived in Lebanon to feed needy families throughout the country, it
was announced Friday.
   The Agency for International Development said the food arrived by
boat at the northern port of Tripoli and will be distributed by Save
the Children, a relief organization based in Connecticut.
   The food consists of rice, lentils and vegetable oil. During
heavy fighting over the past several months, Save the Children has
distributed rations to about a third of the population of Lebanon,
the announcement said.

<HEAD>Ethics Post Contender Withdrawn From Consideration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Houston judge and religious leader who was
President Bush's choice to head the Office of Government Ethics has
been removed from consideration for the post as the result of an FBI
background check, White House officials said Friday.
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Paul
Pressler was taken out of the running because of a ``personal
situation'' unearthed by the FBI probe and not because there was any
evidence of wrongdoing.
   Pressler is a Houston civil court judge and a national leader of
the fundamentalist movement within the Southern Baptist Convention.
   Pressler, who was in San Francisco on Friday, could not be
reached for comment. A woman answering the phone at his hotel
extension said ``he's not taking any calls from reporters.''
   The Washington Post, which first reported that Pressler's name
had been removed from consideration in a story in Friday's editions,
cited ``ethics problems'' in the background of the man Bush wanted
to run the ethics office.
   White House officials confirmed the account but said, without
further elaboration, that the problem was one of a potential ethical
problem. ``He just wasn't the right man for the job,'' said one
official.
   Thus, the job remains vacant even though Bush made the post a
major issue in his 1988 election campaign and promised to name a
tough administrator to head the office shortly after taking office
last January.
   ``It's a position of great importance for the president. We're
looking for the best candidate,'' said deputy press secretary Alixe
Glen.
   Pressler's name was sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
in July for a routine background check.
   The ethics position, part of the Office of Personnel Management,
reviews personal financial filings of federal oficials and
interprets conflict-of-interest laws and rules.
   The Post said that Pressler had been a controversial candidate
for the post even before the FBI check ``because of the key role he
played in the fundamentalist movement,'' one that ``would buy more
animosity than good will.''
   During his campaign, Bush made ethics-in-government a major
issue. In a July 1988 campaign speech, for instance, he said he
would enforce an ``exacting code of conduct.''
   ``To give effect to this commitment, I will establish an office
at the highest level of government _ that of senior counselor to the
president, whose first responsibility will be ethics.''

   Yoko Ono wants to leave the 1960s
behind for a new age of ``wisdom'' she predicts is coming soon.
   ``My spiritual growth took place in the '60s,'' said the widow of
slain ex-Beatle John Lennon.
   ``It's a very private, personal history. But it's a dangerous
trap when you have such an attachment to that, when you don't go
forward,'' Ono said.
   Ono, 56, spoke to reporters Thursday at an art museum where her
new show of bronze sculptures and paintings opens Saturday.
   ``I just feel that it's a better age now,'' she said. ``We are
becoming more and more aware. I said it in '84, that we were
entering the age of wisdom, and I'm glad to be a part of it.''
   Mark David Chapman fatally shot Lennon nine years ago in New York.

<TEXT>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Sam Dimeo, a reporter who lives on the island of
St. Croix, watched as looters stripped stores bare after Hurricane
Hugo devastated the island, leaving many homeless and hungry. Here
is his report.

   Hurricane Hugo taught
me two lessons: there is little you can do to prepare for the
devastation of a killer storm, and a hurricane can bring out the
worst in people as easily as it mows down trees and homes.
   The first lesson I learned while holed up with my wife and two
children in a small bathroom for seven hours, with only a mattress
covering the doorway. The mattress was sucked in and out by the wind
like a pumping heart.
   The house shook, the roof splintered, and through it all the wind
howled. It was a lesson of fear _ fear for the safety of my
7-year-old son, my 3-year-old daughter and my wife.
   I kept thinking of tornados. Hurricanes spawn tornados.
   The tornado never came, but when dawn arrived, it was a shock to
see so much devastation, including my own house in ruins.
   An inspection of the island showed that virtually no telephone or
power pole was left untouched by Hugo's wrath. I drove my small car
in and around downed poles, trees, roofs and assorted pieces of
roofs.
   The real blow came when my neighbor and I drove into the business
area of town and witnessed the frenzied looting.
   These were not mobs or rioters or crazy people out to hurt, maim
and kill. They were simply sick people, stealing first from hardware
stores and supermarkets, then from any business they could find.
   They weren't taking basic items for survival.
   I saw mothers and fathers looting with their children, carrying
toys, plants and plastic Halloween pumpkins.
   Store owners said they were very politely shoved aside by the
scavengers as they cleaned out stores of such non-essential items as
bolts of cloth and jewelry.
   One store owner said he had a gun to keep the mob away. But the
gun apparently didn't scare anyone _ they pushed him aside and
emptied his store, even of such items as sports trophies.
   In town, the stores were systematically looted. Television and
radio sets and VCRs were popular items.
   One manager of a major department store said his establishment
and two others nearby survived Hugo, but not the looters.
   A witness saw a woman carrying two full cases of carrot cake mix
on her head. Others drove around in trucks loaded with loot.
   They seemed so matter-of-fact about taking what didn't belong to
them _ items that would do little to relieve the stress of living
without electricity and telephones.
   An insurance agent told me that people always seem to respond to
major disasters by looting. He said he believed it was a primal
instinct. Perhaps he is right.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Friday arrested a group of Jewish
refuseniks who demonstrated near the Kremlin to push for their right
to emigrate, a witness said.
   The demonstration was timed to coincide with meetings in
Washington between Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and
President Bush and other U.S. officials.
   Vadim Kotlyar said his uncle, Mark Kotlyar, and most of a group
of about 30 demonstrators were hustled onto buses by police about
five minutes after they began their demonstration on the steps of
the Lenin Library in downtown Moscow.
   Kotlyar, a Soviet emigre who now lives in Sun Valley, Idaho, said
police told the protesters they did not have official permission for
the demonstration.
   No force was used in arresting the demonstrators, and no one
resisted, he said.
   ``The people were taken into buses,'' Kotlyar said. ``It seemed
that almost all of them were detained. It was done very swiftly.''
   His uncle, from Kiev, has been denied permission to emigrate for
more than a decade because Soviet officials claim he has access to
state secrets, Kotlyar said.
   One of the leaders of the group, Alexander Rappoport, was
sentenced to five days in jail, said his wife Elena.
   Three others were given jail sentences and the remainder of those
arrested were fined and released, she said.
   The law requires that demonstrators receive permission from city
authorities to hold demonstrations. But protesters say that in many
cases city authorities deny permission for no reason or never
respond.
   Refuseniks regularly call demonstrations during meetings between
Soviet and U.S. officials to publicize their plight.
   U.S. officials say human rights questions are among those that
they are planning to discuss with Shevardnadze.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union has climbed rapidly in
the last two years.
   More than 30,000 have emigrated already this year, including
6,000 who left last month, according to figures of the
Intergovernmental Committee on Migration in Geneva.
   The increase has created a huge backlog of Soviet Jews who wish
to settle in the United States.
   But others are denied permission to emigrate either because of
their alleged access to state secrets or because relatives refuse to
waive financial claims against them.

   Two American citizens of Latvian descent have been
barred from entering the Soviet Union for the next five years for
allegedly violating travel restrictions, the Tass news agency said
Friday.
   According to Tass, Juris Kaza and Peteris Elferts came to Latvia
with valid visas but broke regulations by traveling to areas closed
to foreigners. It did not say whether the two already have left the
Soviet Union, nor did it indicate where they are from in the United
States.
   KGB secret police in Riga, the Latvian capital, told Tass that
Kaza arrived on a tourist visa.
   ``He sneaked into a helicopter on Aug. 23, used by a camera team
of Latvian television, to fly over a wooded area, and filmed
territory closed to foreigners,'' Tass said.
   Aug. 23 was the date of a demonstration throughout the Baltic
republics marking the 50th anniversary of a secret agreement between
Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler dividing Eastern Europe into spheres
of influence on the eve of World War II. More than a million Baltic
residents joined hands in a human chain to mark the anniversary.
   Tass reported that around the same time, Elferts was in Latvia at
the invitation of friends and frequently traveled to closed areas.
   ``In one of the regions, he filmed a guarded military facility,''
it said.
   Tass also said Elferts refused to register with police, as
required of all visitors.

<TEXT>
   The father of track star Zola
Budd was found shot to death at his farm and apparently was
murdered, police said Friday.
   Frank Budd, 56, suffered two shotgun wounds to his left side
Thursday evening at his home near the central city of Bloemfontein,
said Sgt. Marelize Visagie. She said a truck and shotgun were
missing from the farmhouse.
   ``I don't know what to say. What can a person say?'' Ms. Budd,
23, said on learning of her father's death.
   Ms. Budd and her father did not communicate in recent years and
he did not attend his daughter's April 15 wedding in Bloemfontein.
   Budd, a retired printer, was divorced from Ms. Budd's mother and
lived alone. The independent South African Press Association
described him as a ``bitter man'' estranged from most of his family.
   Ms. Budd's career has been dogged by bans barring South African
athletes from international competition because of the country's
policies of race discrimination.
   She left South Africa for Britain in 1984 and, amid controversy,
was hurriedly granted a British passport so she could compete in the
1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
   Ms. Budd set several distance-running world records and twice won
the world cross-country championship while living and training in
Britain. But she was pursued by anti-apartheid protesters who said
she should not be allowed to compete.
   In May 1988, she returned to South Africa suffering complete
mental exhaustion, according to her coach John Bryant.
   When Ms. Budd married South African businessman Mike Pieterse,
she indicated she would remain in her homeland indefinitely.
   She recently won a six-mile road race in Bloemfontein, her first
competition in South Africa since she went to Britain five years ago.

   Consumers taking advantage of bargains
increased their spending in August by 0.9 percent even though
incomes rose only 0.4 percent, the government said Friday in another
report pointing toward continued economic expansion.
   The Commerce Department said the jump in consumer spending
followed a 0.6 percent gain in July and was the largest since a 1.1
percent advance in April.
   Income growth, meanwhile, slowed from a 0.7 percent advance in
July, in large part because of strikes against several major
telephone companies. Nevertheless, personal incomes have increased
for nine consecutive months.
   ``Consumers are still basically positive in their attitudes,
largely based on a favorable job outlook,'' said David Jones, an
economist with Aubrey Lanston &amp; Co., a New York government
securities dealer.
   ``As long as the job sector holds up, and it certainly seems
likely to do so, I think consumers will continue to spend, at least
when they're given a bargain.''
   Jones pointed to strong rebate-induced sales of automobiles in
August as an example of consumer bargain-buying and a major element
of that month's consumer spending gain.
   ``In a sense, that's good,'' he said. ``As long as consumers buy
only when given a bargain, that will limit the potential for
inflation.''
   William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, also attributed the boost in consumer spending in part
on declining prices and said the report ``indicates that consumer
confidence will keep the economy from slipping into a deep
downturn.''
   ``This is a good sign for businesses which have suffered from
slow growth in consumption and falling profits since last October,''
he said.
   Consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of economic
health because it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity. Other recent reports show an economy continuing
to grow, although at a slower pace as the Federal Reserve continues
to keep short-term interest rates high to contain inflation.
   Personal consumption spending, which includes everything except
interest payments on debt, rose $31.8 billion in August, compared
with a $21.1 billion advance in July.
   Purchases of durable goods, cars and other big-ticket items
expected to last more than three years, rose $22.9 billion after
gaining $3.4 billion in July.
   MacReynolds said the resurgence in durables spending doesn't
create new inflationary pressures because prices in that sector have
risen less than 2 percent in the last year and ``durables production
has lagged behind the rest of the economy, leaving ample capacity to
expand.''
   Non-durable goods purchases fell $3.6 billion after increasing
$4.8 billion in the previous month.
   Purchases of services, which includes housing costs, rose $12.5
billion compared with a $13 billion increase in July.
   Americans' disposable, or after-tax income rose 0.4 percent in
August, down slightly from a 0.7 percent after-tax increase in July.
But their savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable income,
fell 6.7 percent after gaining 1.7 percent in the previous month.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
decreased $9.2 billion in August compared with a $23.5 billion
increase in July. Payrolls at manufacturing companies rose by $3.2
billion, up from a July increase of $2.1 billion.
   Overall, personal consumption spending came in at an annual rate
of $3.51 trillion in August after $3.48 trillion in July.
   Personal incomes totaled $4.47 trillion at an annual rate in
August after a revised $4.45 trillion in July.

<HEAD>Acid-Rain Compromise Would Exempt Seven States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate authors of clean-air legislation said
Friday that they have worked out a compromise that would exempt
seven states from rigid requirements to reduce acid-rain emissions.
   The compromise authored by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, is designed to win support for
their acid-rain proposal.
   Baucus' home state of Montana, as well as Kansas, Minnesota,
North Dakota, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming would be exempted because
they use scrubbers on more than 50 percent of their coal-fired
generating capacity. Scrubbers are pollution-control devices that
use a spray of water to trap pollutants and cool emissions.
   Acid rain reduction will be one-third of any clean-air
legislation passed by Congress, along with curbing ozone pollution
and controlling airborne toxic chemicals.
   Bush has submitted a comprehensive clean air bill to Congress
that's moving through the amendment process. It is before the House
Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee.
   The Senate has not begun to amend clean-air legislation, but is
expected to use the Baucus-Mitchell compromise as the vehicle when
the process begins there.
   Mitchell and Baucus said at a news conference that their plan
also calls for a 10 million ton reduction of sulfur dioxide over
1980 levels _ the same improvement President Bush wants.
   Acid rain forms when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are
chemically transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric or nitric
acids, sometimes carried hundreds of miles in the air, and return to
earth in rain or snow.
   The pollution has been associated with destruction of aquatic
life in lakes, decline of forests, deterioration of buildings and
human lung damage.
   The Senate compromise also would:
   _Achieve the 10 million ton sulfur dioxide reduction by Jan. 1,
2000, while the Bush plan targets the end of the year for the same
result.
   _A requirement that emissions couldn't increase once the
reduction is achieved, a cap that also is a feature of the Bush
legislation.
   _Place the burden for the initial sulfur dioxide reductions on 20
power plants burning dirty coal rather than the 107 plants that
would carry the burden under the Bush legislation.
   _A 2 million ton reduction by the start of 2000 for nitrogen
oxides. The Bush bill would slow growth of that pollutant, but still
permit an increase of 1 million tons in the air over the next decade.
   _Provide that new sources of acid rain emissions take into
account the efficiency of the power plant, which could be an
important factor in easing global warming.
   Every region of the United States wants to reduce acid rain, but
there are fierce disputes about who will pay the bill.
   The states that would benefit from the compromise contend they
are victimized by a provision in current law that requires that all
new coal-fired power plants use scrubbers, including those that burn
so-called ``clean'' low sulfur coal mined in the West.
   The requirement, Baucus said, ``has imposed a huge and
environmentally unjustified burden on the West. Today we propose to
end that hoax.''
   Mitchell said ``millions of dollars have been spent'' on the
scrubbers by states that suffered the ``adverse effects'' of current
law even though their coal-fired plants produce little pollution.
   After 2000, the Mitchell-Baucus plan would eliminate the scrubber
provision for new plants.
   The compromise plan doesn't address another regional dispute that
remains to be negotiated: the contention of nine mostly Midwestern
states that they would be paying a disproportionate share of acid
rain reductions.
   The brunt of the cost would be passed on to electic ratepayers
whose utilities burn polluting, high sulfur coal.

<HEAD>Lithuania Challenges Moscow on Two Fronts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Baltic republic of Lithuania on Friday pushed
Moscow's limits on its sovereignty in party and government affairs,
despite a warning to restive republics from the national Communist
Party.
   The Supreme Soviet, or legislature, of the republic approved a
law on economic independence declaring that all natural resources in
Lithuania belong to the republic, not to the national government.
   Its Communist Party published a draft of its party platform
calling for a federation of Communist parties from the 15 Soviet
republics rather than a unified party, as President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev demanded.
   The separate moves represented the latest challenges to central
rule from the Baltics, which have faced growing calls for
independence from Moscow.
   Asked in a telephone interview whether he expected the Lithuanian
party program to conflict with Moscow's effort to prevent party
organizations in the republics from straying too far, national
parliamentarian Mecys Laurinkus said, ``Of course, I'm convinced of
that.''
   Tass reported that Gorbachev, who closed a party Central
Committee meeting on ethnic relations Wednesday, said a federation
of parties ``would mean an end to our party in the form in which it
was founded by Lenin, and would strike an irreparable blow to
socialism.''
   Gorbachev and the Central Committee told the Baltic republics
about a month ago that separatists were leading them into an abyss,
and the Soviet leader said in opening the Central Committee meeting
Tuesday that separatist ``demagogues'' could not be tolerated.
   The Soviet news agency reported the Lithuanian party challenge
came in its party platform, which was published Friday in
Lithuanian, Russian and Polish.
   The Lithuanian party declared that it was separating itself from
past Stalinist repression and dogmatic Marxism-Leninism. Josef
Stalin absorbed Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia into the Soviet Union,
then killed or exiled thousands of their residents.
   The republic's Supreme Soviet approved a decree from the
Lithuanian government on economic independence, said Laurinkus and
other members of the Sajudis political movement.
   They said they expected conflicts with Moscow on that front as
well, but it was unclear how severe they would be.
   At the first session of the national Supreme Soviet parliament
this summer, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia won the right to develop
much greater economic independence beginning Jan. 1.
   The national Communist Party platform on ethnic relations
approved in Moscow on Wednesday recognizes republics' rights to own
the natural resources on their territory.
   But Lithuanian legislators said there likely would be differences
of interpretation that must be worked out by the fall session of the
national Supreme Soviet, which begins Monday.
   In Soviet Central Asia, the legislature of the Kazakhstan
republic on Friday followed moves by many other republics and
declared Kazakh the official language, Tass said.
   It said Russian was recognized in the law as the language of
communications between ethnic groups in the republic of 16 million
people. Kazakhs make up only about 40 percent of the republic's
population.

<HEAD>Talk of Over-Strong Dollar as Western Financial Leaders Meet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On the eve of a meeting of finance officials of
the world's seven biggest economic powers, the Bush administration
insisted Friday that efforts to stabilize the value of the dollar
have not fallen apart.
   But many private economists expressed criticism about the current
state of international economic coordination and said they were
expecting little more than vague rhetoric at the end of day-long
discussions on Saturday.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan will host the talks with their counterparts from
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   It will be the first meeting of finance ministers and central
bank presidents from the seven nations since last April. Since that
time, the so-called Group of Seven has seemingly lost its control
over international currency markets.
   The dollar is currently trading above the ceilings set by the
Group of Seven despite numerous rounds of coordinated intervention,
the process by which countries buy and sell currencies on the open
market in an effort to influence the price.
   Some analysts blame the Bush administration for the failure to
get the dollar under control, saying that Brady, unlike former
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, has been too complacent about
the dangers a high dollar poses to the U.S. economy.
   Baker in 1985 launched an effort with other G-7 countries to push
the dollar lower in order to curb record-high U.S. trade deficits. A
weaker dollar makes U.S. goods more competitive on overseas markets
while making imports more expensive for American consumers.
   But Brady has been much less of an activist in this area,
generally choosing to play down concerns that the dollar's strength
was threatening to abort improvements in the U.S. trade deficit.
   A senior Treasury official, briefing reporters on Friday,
disputed contentions that the economic coordination effort had
broken down, saying that it was the administration's view that
``economic coordination is working well.''
   ``We think we have had a considerable measure of success in terms
of improving the performance of the world economy,'' said the
official, who spoke on the condition that his name not be revealed.
   He noted that the U.S. trade deficit, which fell by a sharp 22
percent in 1988, has declined 11 percent further so far this year,
providing evidence that while the improvement has slowed it has not
come to a halt.
   The official said that if the dollar were to continue
strengthening ``for a lengthy period of time, this obviously, is a
matter of concern ... because obviously we have more (trade
adjustments) to accomplish.''
   Many private economists were looking for a communique to be
issued at the end of Saturday's closed-door talks stating in general
terms the group's continued commitment to stabilize the dollar.
   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill said he was not
looking for anything stronger than vague expressions of concern
about the dollar's strength and the need to see the value of the
greenback stabilized.
   ``They should be doing something to bring the dollar down. I
think they would like to, but I don't think they know what to do,''
Wyss said.
   Many analysts said that controlling the dollar is virtually
imposible without commitments on the part of the Japanese and the
West Germans to boost interest rates. Higher interest rates in those
countries would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive
and thus help to push the dollar lower.
   David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer, said that he was looking for
stepped-up intervention and more public comments in coming weeks in
an effort to push the dollar lower even if the new determination is
not reflected in Saturday's communique.
   He said the Bush administration is coming to the realization that
without some action, a growing trade deficit could weaken the
economy around the time of next year's mid-term congressional
elections, thus hurting Republican chances.
   The Group of Seven discussions were being held before the start
of the annual meetings of the 152-nation International Monetary Fund
and its sister lending organization, the World Bank.
   IMF officials have been pushing for a doubling of the fund's
resources to allow it to better handle the crushing $1.3 trillion
Third World debt burden, but the senior Treasury official said
Friday that the United States still has not reached a conclusion
that such an increase is needed.
   However, Dutch Finance Minister H. O. Ruding, chairman of the
IMF's policy-setting Interim Committee, told reporters Friday that
he expected the eventual outcome of the debate would result in the
IMF seeing its resources boosted by between 50 percent and 67
percent.

   Salvadoran guerrillas said Friday they
will not extend a truce that runs out at midnight because the
government has not responded positively to their peace efforts.
   Salvador Samayoa, spokesman for the leftist Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, also accused the Salvadoran military of
trying to sabotage peace talks and of using the 11-day truce to
increase repression in the Central American country.
   He warned the guerrillas will take their war from the countryside
to cities and other more populated places.
   Samayoa also criticized the United States for giving $5 million
in aid to President Alfredo Cristiani's right-wing government.
   ``It's an immoral decision on the part of the U.S. ... at a time
when Salvadorans are starting a peace process,'' he said, speaking
to reporters at the foreign correspondents' club in Managua.
   The rebels had announced a Sept. 13-23 cease-fire for peace talks
that took place in Mexico City.
   The conference was considered a success and both sides agreed to
meet again in Costa Rica on Oct. 16-17 for more talks about halting
El Salvador's nearly 10-year-old civil war.
   Samayoa said guerrilla representatives still plan to attend the
Costa Rica talks, but he acccused ``powerful sectors in the
Salvadoran military'' of trying to block them.
   ``There will be no extension to the military truce. The truce was
implemented for political reasons, but there hasn't been a positive
response from the government ... (which) is using the talks as a
smokescreen to deepen repression.''
   He said up to 60 people have been detained recently by the
military throughout El Salvador. He did not give further details.
   Samayoa also said a U.N. commission traveling around the region
to supervise peace efforts had not been allowed to visit the eastern
provinces of Morazan and Salatenango and an area called Las Flores _
areas over which the guerrillas claim control.
   Describing a new guerrilla strategy, he said: ``The war now will
be in cities, roads and communities; in places of greater population
density.''
   At least 70,000 people have been killed in the war.

   The federal deficit through August is running
11.7 percent behind last year, the Treasury Department said Friday,
despite the first funds spent by a new government agency created to
deal with savings and loans failures.
   The August deficit of $22.2 billion was down 4 percent from the
same month a year ago and followed a $18.2 billion deficit in July.
   Revenue last month totaled $76.3 billion, up 9.8 percent from a
year ago, while spending was up 6.3 percent to $98.4 billion.
   For the first 11 months of the fiscal year which ends Sept. 30,
the deficit totals $145.9 billion, 11.7 percent lower than the same
period for fiscal 1988.
   However, both government and private analysts expect the deficit
for all of fiscal 1989 will be $5 billion to $15 billion greater
than the $155.2 billion budget gap in 1988. The Bush administration
is forecasting just under $170 billion in red ink while the
Congressional Budget Office expects a $161 billion deficit.
   Earlier this summer, Congress voted to add $20 billion for S&amp;L
rescues and the initial expenditures showed up in the budget
statement the first time in August, totaling $14.2 billion.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the new agency set up to deal with
the hundreds of failed thrifts, said Thursday it planned to spend $8
billion by the end of the month to rescue or close those S&amp;Ls that
had failed and hold another $12 billion in reserve for emergencies
and to pay off high interest-bearing certificates of deposits issued
by failed thrifts.
   Military spending continued to be the largest spending category,
totaling $25.3 billion in August and $267.1 billion so far this
year, up 2.4 percent from 1988.
   Other large spending categories were:
   _ Interest on the national debt, the fastest growing item: $17.3
billion last month and $244.6 billion so far in fiscal 1989, up 12.9
percent from the previous year.
   _ Social Security: $19.5 billion in August and $208.3 billion so
far this year, up 6.2 percent from 1988.
   _ Other programs in the Department of Health and Human Services:
$15.3 billion last month and $156.9 billion so far in 1989, up 8.5
percent from a year earlier.

   Senate leaders Friday postponed final passage
of an airline smoking ban, a boost in the ceiling on
government-backed mortgages and other measures, held back by a
nine-day-old legislative logjam.
   Leaders of both parties had hoped the Senate would formally adopt
four spending bills Friday _ including one containing a ban on
cigarette smoking on all domestic airline flights, and another
lifting dollar-amount limits on home loans backed by the Federal
Housing Administration.
   But that scenario changed when Democratic and Republican
senators, and the administration, remained unable to agree on how to
enlarge a $7.9 billion package of anti-drug initiatives President
Bush has advanced. Republicans have refused to allow votes on final
passage of the four bills while discussions on the drug plan proceed.
   The White House rejected a proposed compromise Thursday night,
sources said, sending the parties back to the bargaining table
Friday. The Democrats have proposed spending more than the GOP
wants, and have suggested defense cuts to pay for the drug effort
that Bush considers excessive.
   ``It would be tragic if the president were to reject this at this
point,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, told
reporters.
   Mitchell and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said
they hoped the measures could be approved Monday.
   Since partisan fencing over drugs began Sept. 12, the Senate has
completed all work short of final passage on four spending bills for
fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.
   Congressional leaders set a goal months ago of completing all 13
annual spending bills for 1990 by Sept. 30. So far, one has been
sent to Bush for his signature.
   An $11.9 billion transportation bill would make it illegal to
smoke on any domestic airline route. Current law forbids smoking on
flights lasting two hours or less, effecting four-fifths of all
routes. The Senate finished all work on the bill and was prepared to
vote its final approval on Sept. 14.
   Last Tuesday, the Senate completed debate on legislation boosting
the limit on mortgages the Federal Housing Administration can insure
from $101,250 to $124,875. That was part of a $67.2 billion bill
financing veterans, housing and space programs.
   A $14.4 billion foreign aid bill increasing U.S. aid to El
Salvador, Poland and Hungary was finished by the Senate on Wednesday.
   Thursday, lawmakers completed writing a $157.4 billion measure
for health and labor programs that slightly eases the limits on the
use of federal monies for abortions.
   The provision would allow Medicaid assistance for low-income
women to be used to abort pregnancies caused by rape or incest or
those that threaten the woman's health. Such aid can now be used
only when the mother's life is at risk.

<HEAD>Nearly Half of Benefits from Democrats' IRA Proposal Would Aid the
Well-off</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Budget-Taxes, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half the benefit of a Democratic
proposal to allow all workers tax-deductible Individual Retirement
Accounts would go to those with incomes above $75,000, the Senate
Finance Committee said Friday.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the committee and author
of the IRA proposal, released the figures to show that the plan
still would provide far less benefit to the richest Americans than
would President Bush's competing plan to cut the capital-gains tax.
   The capital-gains cut recommended by Bush would deliver 15.1
percent of its benefits to those with incomes under $75,000,
according to a study by the staff of the Joint Committee on
Taxation. That compares with 50.9 percent for Bentsen's bill and
14.7 percent for the capital-gains cut voted by the House Ways and
Means Committee.
   At the other end of the income scale, those over $200,000 a year
would get 6.7 percent of the tax benefits of the IRA proposal, 60
percent of Bush's capital-gains reduction and 60.2 percent of the
Ways and Means cut in capital-gains taxes.
   The Finance Committee staff noted that the estimates do not take
into account that Bentsen's proposal would permit penalty-free
withdrawals from IRAs to make the down payemnt on a first home or to
pay for a college education.
   ``It is anticipated that those proposals would provide even more
benefits to lower- and middle-income Americans,'' the Finance
Committee staff wrote.
   The House may consider next week a plan by the Democratic
leadership to eliminate the capital-gains cut from the Ways and
Means bill and substitute the IRA expansion. Democrats contend IRAs
would do more to encourage saving than would a capital-gains
reduction.
   The 1986 tax overhaul restricted tax-deductible IRAs to
lower-income workers and to those with higher incomes who are not
covered by company pensions.
   Bentsen's plan would allow any worker regardless of income who is
not now eligible for a fully deductible IRA to deduct up to $1,000 a
year in contributions.

<TEXT>
   At least 21 people died after
drinking toxic white rum and scores others were hospitalized in
critical condition in this city on Colombia's Caribbean coast,
officials said Friday.
   The victims, most of them fishermen, street vendors or day
laborers, suffered blindness, vomiting and chills, said officials
from the mayor's office. Bodies of the first victims were discovered
late Thursday along city streets; four more bodies were found Friday
afternoon.
   The General Hospital of Barranquilla said 17 people died
overnight.
   ``The lab tests show remnants of methylic alcohol in the urine of
those who died,'' General Hospital toxicologist Orlando Cepeda Diaz
said. ``It is a catastrophic and worrisome situtation because the
patients are arriving at the hospital in terminal condition.''
   Cepeda Diaz said many of the victims stumbled into the hospital
blind and vomiting; all told authorities they had recently drank
some white rum.
   Officials said the rum in question was sold for 40 cents, when
the normal price is $1.50. Police said nine people have been
arrested in connection with the case and more than 300 bottles of
the rum confiscated.
   The hospital broadcast radio warnings for anyone who drank white
rum the last three days to go immediately to the hospital for tests.

<HEAD>Illegal Decisions to Deny Treatment to Handicapped Said to Persist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some doctors and hospitals illegally deny
lifesaving treatment to infants born with severe physical and mental
disabilities, said a government report released Friday.
   Decisions to withhold medical treatment, food and fluids to these
disabled children persist in many instances with the tacit
cooperation of federal, state and local government agencies despite
a federal law prohibiting the practice, the study concluded.
   The 500-page report, ``Medical Discrimination Against Children
with Disabilities,'' was released by the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights.
   The study's conclusions are based on anecdotal evidence, an
examination of how hospital infant-care review committees and child
protection agencies have enforced the law and a national random
survey of physician attitudes published late last year.
   In that survey, 75 percent of the responding physicians said they
would be neutral or would discourage surgery for infants with spina
bifida and another severe disability, hydrocephalus.
   The study concludes that decisions to deny such treatment often
are not made on the basis of medical judgments and are
discriminatory.
   Many times, the commission said, such decisions are based on
``erroneous judgments concerning the quality of life'' or ``social
judgments that such a person's continued existence'' places an
``unacceptable'' burden on families and taxpayers.
   ``This report deals with discrimination, not medical judgments,''
said Commissioner Esther Buckley.
   When medical care ``is denied to a person with a disability
because the doctor thinks it is horrible to live a life with a
disability, that is discrimination,'' Buckley said at a news
conference Friday.
   ``Discrimination on the basis of disability is illegal and, in my
view, immoral, whether it is practiced by an employer, a school, a
hotel, a hospital social worker or a doctor making treatment
decisions,'' echoed Commissioner Robert A. Destro.
   Dr. Norman Fost, chairman of the bioethics committee of the
American Academy of Pediatrics said the report ignores ``dramatic
changes'' in the treatment of handicapped newborns.
   ``I don't know of a single case of an infant with Down's syndrome
with medical care being withheld in the last three years,'' said
Fost, explaining that most instances of treatment denial prior to
1984 involved infants with Down's syndrome or spina bifida.
   He charged that the report fails to address the current ``massive
problem of overtreatment'' of these infants as a result of doctors'
fear of legal liability.
   ``It's extremist to say that the quality of a patient's life is
irrelevant to medical decisions,'' Fost charged. ``The commission
would have us believe that doesn't matter.''
   The 4-year study was prompted by the 1986 Supreme Court ``Baby
Doe'' decision in which the court struck down federal regulations
that would interfere in parental decisions regarding medical care
for babies with severe birth defects.
   The report criticizes hospital-based infant care review and
ethics committees and their monitoring by the Department of Health
and Human Services.
   Citing a 1987 HHS inspector general's report, the study noted
that the department examined 20 to 36 cases of treatment denial at
10 hospitals but told child welfare agencies about just three of the
cases.
   The report chided the ageny's lack of efforts to estimate from
the sample studied how many such cases there have been nationwide
since the court's ruling. The commission said that there may be
``hundreds of potential Infant Doe cases'' since passage of the 1984
Child Abuse Amendments.
   But the study offered no numbers of documented cases of treatment
denial since enactment of the legal protections.
   Destro said most states are not certain which children are
covered by the law and which aren't.
   One state, Utah, ``went so far as to add an entirely new category
of cases in which treatment could be denied,'' he said.
   Replying to the report, HHS spokeswoman Janet Hartnett said:
   ``We have conducted a comprehensive, state-by-state review and
have concluded that all states which receive funds under the Child
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act are in full compliance with these
requirements for the protection of disabled infants.''
   Asked if the department agreed with the commission's conclusions,
an official who requested anonymity said there would be no comment
on the report until a detailed review of it was conducted.
   The commission voted in January to approve the final draft of the
study. Its release Friday followed additional staff work on the
report to answer questions raised at the time of the vote by members
of the panel.
   Commission Chairman William B. Allen was the sole dissenter on
the eight-member panel.

   Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of
several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path
Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee
the South Carolina coast.
   But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.
   Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models
to track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C.
   ``All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and
forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those
models,'' said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's satellite service.
   Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but
forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for
evacuation.
   ``Overall, I think the tracking models gave us a very good idea
where Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in a
timely manner,'' said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.
   The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the
intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane
just hours before it slammed into Charleston.
   ``It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we
don't have very reliable computer models for that,'' McAdie said.
``We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.''
   The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute
increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Force
reconnaissance.
   Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35
years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools
were reports from aircraft or ships.
   ``We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our
forecasts were less accurate,'' Clark said.
   In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites to
obtain a global weather picture. Information from the satellite is
used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that
television viewers see every night.
   Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the
National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information to
the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to
account for current weather conditions and the position of the
hurricane.
   To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze
supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar
storms and the current path of the hurricane.
   Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.
   Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the Massachussetts
Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.
   ``Congress and the American people are suffering from the
collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by
satellites and that just isn't true,'' Emmanuel said.
   Satellites can give a ``pretty picture,'' he said, but not enough
information about the wind and temperatures that affect a
hurricane's path.
   ``Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes
comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very
good job,'' Emmanuel said.
   Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving
every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
   ``We have to remember that those models used are only guidance
products,'' Pyke said, ``and that it's ultimately the job of the
forecaster to predict the storm's path.''

   The school board has approved a plan to
hire armed police officers to patrol high schools.
   Under the program, which the Bossier Parish School Board approved
unanimously Thursday night, a teaching-certified police officer
would be hired for each high school to assist in law enforcement, to
counsel troubled youth and to teach safety and drug education.
   ``It's designed to be a preventive measure that will blend
education and law enforcement,'' said David Walden, a public schools
drug education supervisor in Bossier, in northern Louisiana. ``If
the current trend of violence in the schools is not abated, this
program is going to be milquetoast compared to what's coming down
the pike.''
   The officers would wear uniforms or plainclothes and carry
standard service revolvers, Walden said. The program could begin as
early as spring, officials said.
   The school system, which had 24 drug-related suspensions last
year, has had three this year and one gun confiscation, he said.

   Tropical Storm Hugo brought 90 mph gusts, heavy
rains and tornadoes Friday as it sliced across North Carolina,
leaving an infant dead and more than 400,000 people without
electricity.
   ``It's frightening when you can't stand up long enough to go to
the basement,'' said Dr. John Roper, who had back surgery two months
ago and described the storm as the most terrifying experience of his
life. Roper's house in Charlotte was hit by a 60-foot oak.
   The storm _ downgraded from hurricane status after it slammed
Charleston, S.C., but still packing lethal wind and rain _ entered
North Carolina about 5 a.m. and exited about 11:50 a.m. into
southwest Virginia and Tennessee.
   ``There has been heavy wind damage and very heavy, torrential
rains along the path of the storm,'' said Gov. Jim Martin. ``Because
the eye of the storm came ashore further south than we had expected,
the coastal damage was not as severe as we had prepared for.''
   A 6-month-old infant in Union County, just southeast of
Charlotte, was killed when a tree fell onto a house, hitting the
baby's crib, state emergency management spokesman Jeff Merritt said.
   A 400-foot television transmission tower at WSOC in Charlotte
toppled onto the station building.
   State officials said drinking water may have been contaminated in
nine counties because of power outages.
   Near the federal courthouse in Charlotte, where Jim Bakker's
fraud and conspiracy trial was postponed until Monday because of the
storm, the Mister Hot Dog restaurant was demolished.
   ``It's all right; it's going to get better,'' proclaimed owner
John Bolick as he cleaned up buns and weiners.
   Bill Pinson, who watched utility crews work on a ruptured water
main at his two-story home, which was hit by a large willow oak. He
said he had been so worried about his beach property at Edisto
Island near Charleston, S.C., that he ``didn't even think about this
house.''
   North Carolina's coast escaped Hurricane Hugo's wrath. But
residents from Charlotte, on the South Carolina line, to Alleghany
County, which borders southwest Virginia, were't as lucky with the
tropical storm.
   At the height of the storm, roads and streams were choked with
floodwaters in hillier and mountainous section of the state.
   ``It's raining so hard you can't see your hand in front of you,''
said Alleghany County Deputy Sheriff Tim Blevins. ``The main
arteries into town are either full of water or full of trees.''
   Duke Power Co. said 375,000 customers were without power in North
Carolina and three South Carolina counties and could be out for
several days. Carter said the outages affected 86 percent of Duke
Power's 230,000 customers in Charlotte, the state's largest city.
   Blue Ridge Electric Membership Cooperative said 20,000 customers
were without power in three mountain counties near the Tennessee
line. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. said 27,000 customers were in the
dark in south-central North Carolina.
   Tornadoes that spun off Hugo knocked trees onto power lines and
destroyed at least two mobile homes in the Blue Ridge foothills.
   A wind speed of more than 80 mph was clocked atop a mountain near
the resort town of Blowing Rock.
   Several propane gas tanks _ weighing from 20 pounds to 500 pounds
_ floated into the New River, said Boone Fire Chief Reggie Hessler.
Some were leaking, but there was enough wind to keep fumes from
presenting a danger, he said.
   In Fayetteville, the roof of a Days Inn motel blew onto the cars
of people from South Carolina who had checked into the motel to
escape the storm's wrath. A roof was blown off a warehouse in
Whiteville.
   Winds were clocked at 75 mph at Charlotte-Douglas International
Airport, where flights were canceled Friday morning. A gust to 90
mph prompted evacuation of the control towert. Flights also were
canceled at Raleigh-Durham International Airport and coastal
Wilmington's New Hanover County Airport.
   The weather service said the Outer Banks could experience erosion
and tidal overwash because of the rough seas.

<HEAD>Hungary Moves to Rehabilitate Cardinal Mindszenty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government spokesman said Friday that
Hungary's Supreme Court will review the trial of the late Cardinal
Jozsef Mindszenty, who was sentenced to life in prison on trumped-up
charges of treason.
   The government action in presenting the case for review is
considered to amount to Mindszenty's de-facto posthumous
rehabilitation.
   Spokesman Zsolt Bajnok said the government also decided to
rehabilitate nearly 100,000 Hungarians deported or interned in the
early 1950s under the Stalinist rule of then-leader Matyas Rakosi.
   The decisions are part of the leadership's review of Hungary's
past that has led to rehabilitating Imre Nagy, leader of the 1956
anti-Stalinist uprising who was executed in 1958, and recognition of
his attempted reforms. Many of them are embraced by the current
leadership in its own reform drive.
   Bajnok told reporters the chief prosecutor concluded that the
trial against Mindszenty was solely political and lacked all factual
basis.
   Seven other cases are also to be presented for review.
   Mindszenty was arrested in 1948 as an enemy of communism. After a
humiliating trial, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1949 on
spurious charges of high treason.
   Hungarian revolutionaries freed him from prison in 1956 in the
tumultuous days of the uprising. After the revolt was crushed by the
Soviets, Mindszenty found shelter in the U.S. mission in Budapest
until 1971 when he left the asylum under an agreement worked out
between the Vatican and the Hungarian government.
   Mindszenty stayed briefly in Rome, then settled in Vienna, where
he died on May 6, 1975, at age 83.
   The government decided last February to review all political
trials conducted from 1945 to 1962.
   Bajnok said about 55,000 Hungarians were interned and 43,000
deported from 1949 to 1953. He said about 17,000 of these people are
still alive.
   He said they would receive a token increase on their pensions of
$8 a month.
   Referring to Hungary's struggle to rejuvenate its stagnating
economy and pay back its $17 billion foreign debt, Bajnok said the
government does ``not have the funds to pay genuine compensation.''
   He said the government would also pay a pension supplement to the
22,000 people sentenced after the 1956 uprising.
   Survivors of reprisals complained the government decision was
unacceptable.
   Tibor Zimanyi, head of a group of internment camp veterans, told
The Associated Press the token pensions were a ``humiliation of
those who had been persecuted unjustly.''
   Gabor Roszik, the first opposition member to be elected to
Parliament, proposed that Parliament declare Oct. 23, the day the
1956 revolt broke out, a national holiday, the official MTI news
agency said. House Speaker Matyas Szueros has proposed it be a day
of national remembrance.
   The Hungarian daily Esti Hirlap meanwhile reported on Friday that
three Czechoslovak border guards chased into Hungary in pursuit of
13 East Germans seeking to emigrate to the West and assaulted one of
them.
   It said the incident took place last Saturday at the Rajka border
crossing.
   It said East Germans in three cars drove straight through the
Czechoslovak border checkpoint, then jumped from the cars and ran
onto Hungarian territory.
   The guards ran after them and ``physically assaulted'' one of
them before returning to their post, the daily quoted Col. Tibor
Vidos, a chief border guard official, as saying.
   Vidos protested, the Czechoslovak side admitted the border
violation, apologized and ``promised that measures have been taken
to avoid similar incidents in the future,'' Esti Hirlap quoted him
as saying.
   Hungarian radio quoted another official as saying all 13 traveled
on to West Germany.
   About 18,000 East Germans have crossed to the West from Hungary
since Budapest leaders opened the country's borders for them on
Sept. 11.
   Many East Germans said they crossed to Hungary illegally from
Czechoslovakia, which lies between East Germany and Hungary, after
being turned back by Czechoslovak border officials.

<HEAD>Advertisers Bow To Logger Pressure And Cancel Ads For Audubon Show</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A National Audubon Society television special
on the forests of the Northwest will be shown without any
commercials after nine companies bowed to pressure from loggers and
yanked their advertising, Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said
Friday.
   While Turner Broadcasting declined to release the names of the
companies, they included Ford Motor Co., Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
which was advertising its Discover Card, and Stroh Brewery Inc.
   Earlier this month, Stroh withdrew its underwriting of the
Audubon Society's television series after Northwest loggers
threatened to quit drinking that brand of beer.
   ``Due to concerted and apparently organized pressure from the
timber industry, many of the advertisers scheduled for the upcoming
World of Audubon special `Ancient Forests: Rage Over Trees' have
canceled their commercials for that time period,'' Turner
Broadcasting said in a statement released in Atlanta.
   Turner said the show will be broadcast as scheduled Sunday night
with public service announcements and promotions for future shows
replacing the commercials.
   ``Turner Broadcasting is committed to the goals and objectives of
the National Audubon Society,'' the statement said. ``We will
continue to telecast World of Audubon specials despite pressure from
special interest groups.''
   David Krupp, a Ford spokesman in Detroit, confirmed that his
company had ``canceled its participation'' in the show on Northwest
forests but added that Ford would continue to advertise in other
Audubon Society televsion specials.
   ``The Ford dealers in the Northwest area asked us to cancel and
because we try to accommodate when we can the requests of our
dealers and customers we decided to withdraw,'' said Krupp.
   Dean Witter Reynolds canceled its lone 30-second commercial
because ``as a general rule we try not to be controversial,'' said
James Flynn, a company spokesman on Long Island, N.Y.
   Flynn said that while his company hadn't received any direct
telephone calls from loggers, its parent company, Sears, had
received a handful.
   Company officials were also aware of Stroh's decision to drop its
underwriting for the series, said Flynn.
   The timber industry and environmentalists have been locked in a
bitter struggle for months over the future of logging in the virgin
forests of the Northwest, which provide prime habitat for the
northern spotted owl.
   The Audubon Society is among the environmental groups that have
sought to have the owl protected as a threatened or endangered
species and logging in the old-growth forests halted.
   ``National Audubon will never be intimidated by timber industry
bullying,'' said Peter Berle, Audubon president. ``We have not and
will not change one second of this documentary ...''
   Berle said pressure from the timber industry represented the
``last gasp in a desperate effort to stop the American people from
seeing a major doumentary film about the public debate over
protection of the Northwest's remaining ancient forests on public
lands.
   ``We firmly believe the public will be furious about this attempt
at censorship, which runs counter to every principle of free speech
embodied in the First Amendment.''

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher arrived in
Moscow on Saturday prepared to offer support for Soviet reforms but
expressing caution on defense issues.
   Mrs. Thatcher's plane landed in the Soviet capital shortly after
midnight for a stopover en route home from a four-day official visit
to Japan. She was greeted in Moscow by Yevgeny Primakov, chairman of
the Soviet of the Union, one of two chambers of the Supreme Soviet
parliament.
   She was to meet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Kremlin
later in the day.
   It is a working visit with special emphasis on disarmament
issues, according to the official Soviet news agency Tass.
   ``Although the views of the two countries do not always coincide,
meetings between the leaders of the U.S.S.R. and Britain have given
an additional impetus to the search for compromise and points of
contact,'' it said.
   In Tokyo, Mrs. Thatcher stressed the need for caution and strong
defenses while urging the West to suppport reformers like Gorbachev.
   ``Even if communism seems to be in terminal decline, we cannot
overlook the fact that communist states still control immensely
powerful military forces,'' she told the International Democratic
Union, an organization of right-of-center political parties.
   ``You do not prevent war by disarmament. You prevent war by
quietly being prepared and having a sure defense,'' she told
reporters Thursday.
   Tass, in a political commentary on her visit, said, ``Western
plans to modernize short-range nuclear weapons, with Britain
insisting on their implementation, are worrying to the U.S.S.R.''
   At the same time, Tass said, ``the Soviet Union is interested in
the way the British will act on the issue of reducing conventional
armed forces and armaments in Europe in the light of the new round
of Vienna talks'' which began this week.
   Mrs. Thatcher has praised Gorbachev's efforts to restructure the
Soviet economy and government.
   ``What Mr. Gorbachev has attempted to do in the Soviet Union is,
I believe, in the interests of liberty as a whole and in the
interest of all other nations as well which believe in the cause of
democracy,'' she said in Japan.
   ``Since he has been general secretary, and now president of the
Soviet Union, his policies have been bold, courageous and
visionary,'' she said. ``Indeed, they are of historic proportions.''
   However, Mrs. Thatcher said the Soviet Union and other East bloc
countries need help with basics such as management and
administrative skills. ``It is very difficult to go from a centrally
planned economy ... to accepting responsibility and knowing how to
go about it,'' she said.
   Tass said, ``The Soviet Union is interested in cooperating with
Britain in all-European affairs (especially) ... prospects of
integration processes in Europe in connection with the establishment
of a united market there.''
   It said the two leaders ``will undoubtedly discuss specific
issues of Soviet-British cooperation, such as the establishment of
joint ventures and Britain's assistance in training personnel.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's meeting with Gorbachev will be the fifth since he
became the Soviet leader in 1985.

<HEAD>Leader Of African Lobby Says U.S. Aid to UNITA Increased Fivefold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a major African American lobbying
group said Friday that U.S. aid to Angolan rebels has increased more
than fivefold.
   Randall Robinson, director of TransAfrica, said in an interiew
that U.S. aid rose from $15 million to $80 million a year to make up
for lost aid from South Africa.
   The aid is covert and no verification could be obtained from
other sources. Robinson said he received his information from
congressional sources.
   The United States has supported the Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, UNITA, in its 14-year civil war with the
Luanda government, which has been backed by 50,000 Cuban troops and
Soviet and East German advisers.
   Under a U.S.-sponsored agreement signed in December, Cuba agreed
to withdraw and South Africa agreed to grant independence to
neighboring Namibia.
   Earlier, South Africa had pledged to stop its support for UNITA.
That support reportedly totaled $80 million annually and consisted
mostly of non-lethal items.
   Robinson said he would leave Saturday for Angola to meet with
Marxist President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and that he would invite
dos Santos to visit the United States.
   Robinson said he had received assurances from members of Congress
that the Angolan leader would be welcom on Capitol Hill despite the
absence of U.S. diplomatic relations.
   He urged President Bush to receive dos Santos as he will Jonas
Savimbi, head of UNITA, next month.
   ``We're responsible in a major way for the devastation of
Angola,'' said Robinson, whose group has been at the forefront of
legislation to impose sanctions on South Africa. ``We ought to stop
fueling that.''
   He urged the Bush administration to grant diplomatic recognition
to Angola, which gained membership with overwhelming support in the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank earlier this week.
   The United States has said it will only establish diplomatic ties
when the government reaches a peace agreement with UNITA and agrees
to fair elections.
   The sides signed a temporary U.S.-backed cease-fire in June, but
the truce and peace talks have crumbled.

   The city's civil rights commission fired
its executive director over complaints from three employees that he
kissed a female staffer's ear and used the word ``nigger'' in the
office.
   The Providence Human Relations Commission voted 8-1 Thursday
night to dismiss Joseph T. Fowlkes Jr. He was suspended with pay in
June for investigation of the allegations by the commission.
   Fowlkes, who is black, has been active in Rhode Island civil
rights activities for more than 20 years. He acknowledged that he
used the word ``nigger'' in the office, but he said he meant no harm.
   Three members of Fowlkes' staff, Christine Caffey, Christine
Roundtree and Debra Santos, said he once kissed another employee's
ear in the office. They also said he explained his tardiness on one
occasion by saying he ``had to kick three women out of my bed.''
   Fowlkes maintained the kiss was innocent and said he was joking
when he said he ``had to run three women out of my house.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
Friday that between 7,000 and 10,000 metric tons of pork bellies
will be sent to Poland as part of a U.S. aid package promised by
President Bush.
   The pork bellies will be part of $108.4 million in food aid
pledged by Bush on Sept. 14. Yeutter said the pork will be donated
under the Food for Progress program authorized by 1985 farm law.
   The Agriculture Department expects to announce in the near future
offers to buy the pork bellies from commercial providers, he said.
Pork bellies are the source of sliced bacon for American consumers.
   A delivery schedule will be worked out with Polish officials, but
Yeutter said shipments probably will be in the winter months when
food shortages can be aggravated by severe weather.
   Bush, in an appearance earlier Friday at a USDA radio show with
farm broadcasters, said that in considering aid to Poland or the
Soviet Union one of the things that is ``absolutely essential is the
reform of their systems.''
   ``They have got to move toward market economies. And I want to
help the Polish people. I'd like to help the Soviets, the people. I
don't want to see the people in these republics that are struggling
for their _ more freedom _ to be set back.''
   Bush said the United States has ``got to insist, as we help with
aid, on the reforms that are necessary. Otherwise, we are simply
putting money down a rathole.''
   Yeutter said in a statement that the pork bellies ``will help
ease food shortages and high prices facing the Polish people at this
time. In consultations with USDA officials, the Polish government
requested pork product donations to help meet current critical food
needs facing the country.''
   The Food for Progress program allows the use of ``U.S. food
resources more effectively in support of countries making
commitments to introduce or expand free enterprise elements in their
agricultural economies,'' the announcement said.

<TEXT>
   A weeklong lull was broken Friday when
at least three rockets blamed on U.S.-backed guerrillas exploded on
midday crowds in Kabul, killing 13 people.
   Such attacks have rocked the capital, sometimes daily, all summer
long. But Kabul had been generally quiet for a week until Friday's
attack, which officials said also wounded 48.
   The latest rocket attacks occurred just before noon in a poor
residential neighborhood and a business district at a time when many
people were walking to meet relatives or visit mosques.
   ``There were many, many people on the street,'' said one resident.
   The Avicina hospital said the casualties included men, women and
children hit when the rockets fell on a crowded thoroughfare near
the ancient Shor Bazaar.
   People in the area dug a grave at the side of the road and filled
it with severed hands and other body parts, residents said.
   They piled stones over the grave, erected a flag and lit as
candle that sputtered in a sudden downpour.
   The government blames the Pakistani-based guerrillas for the
attacks.
   However, the guerrillas claim they only fire at military targets
and the Soviet-backed government fires on civilians in its own
capital.
   At least 300 people have been killed and more than 700 injured in
the rocket attacks since June.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole on Friday
praised the AFL-CIO for its ``unswerving support'' of Poland's
Solidarity free trade union movement.
   ``This support began in the difficult days of the birth of
Solidarity, and greatly contributed to the breathtaking changes in
Poland today,'' she said.
   Mrs. Dole added that ``the ramifications for democracy if this
experiment succeeds _ and it must _ are limitless.''
   She spoke at a ceremony posthumously honoring former AFL-CIO
President George Meany and three other Americans by inducting them
into the Labor Department's Labor Hall of Fame, which involves a set
of permanent exhibits in the department's headquarters building.
   Also addressing the gathering was AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland, who said that ``the four men that we honor today were
unanimous in their faith in trade unionism's value to a free and
democratic society.''
   ``They viewed the labor movement as the natural mechanism through
which working people could help one another _ and thus an essential
element of national progress,'' Kirkland said.
   In her speech, Mrs. Dole declared that ``the spirit of George
Meany can be seen in the unswerving support that Lane Kirkland and
the AFL-CIO has provided to Poland's Solidarity union.''
   She noted that she and her husband, Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., recently visited Poland, arriving there the same day
that Solidarity's Tadeusz Mazowiecki was elected prime minister.
   ``We attended a Solidarity caucus after that election,'' she
said. ``And in that room, one could almost feel the spirit of
democracy come to life. It was a feeling that I will always
remember, and both Bob and I returned from our journey committed to
doing more for Poland.''
   In addition to Meany, others inducted into the Labor Hall of Fame
were:
   _John L. Lewis, founder of the Congress of Industrial
Organizations and former president of the United Mine Workers;
   _James P. Mitchell, who served as labor secretary during the
Eisenhower administration and helped develop federal job training
programs; and
   _A. Philip Randolph, founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car
Porters and an early leader of the civil rights movement.

<TEXT>
   The senator presiding over the impeachment
trial hearings of U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon said Friday he
plans to introduce a constitutional amendment moving such trials
from the Senate to the Supreme Court.
   The high court has ``the most constitutional perspective on both
the protections and the sensitivity of federal judgeships,'' said
Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., in an interview.
   The amendment, which he said would be co-sponsored by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., would apply only to federal judges,
leaving the trial of other federal officials impeached by the House
of Representatives to the Senate.
   An impeachment voted by the House serves as an indictment for
trial before the Senate. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required
for conviction, which carries only one penalty _ removal from office
and disqualification from ever holding federal ``office of honor,
trust or profit.'' Such a removal does not bar ordinary criminal
proceedings.
   In the 200-year history of the United States under the
Constitution, The Senate has tried only 15 impeachments. Three of
them have been in the last three years and all three were of federal
judges.
   Impeachment proceedings are tremendously time-consuming. Fowler
said he spent all of August reading up on the Nixon case prior to
the four-day trial before his special 12-member committee earlier
this month.
   That committee will summarize the undisputed evidence for the
full Senate in a report that also will include the disputed evidence
with explanations of each side's position. The summaries and
explanations, with a transcript of the committee's hearings, will go
to each senator to read before the full Senate takes up the case.
   The Senate will spend at least one full day hearing arguments
from the House prosecutors, the defense attorneys and Nixon himself
if he chooses to speak. The senators then will debate in secret.
   The impeachment of Nixon, chief federal judge in southern
Mississippi, arises from his conviction of perjury for lying to a
grand jury about his involvement in a drug case against a son of a
wealthy businessman. He is serving a five-year sentence.
   The trial of U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne in 1986 took the
committee 10 days and 18 hours of Senate floor time before the
Senate voted to remove Claiborne from office. According to Sen. Bob
Dole, R-Kan. who was majority leader at the time, the Senate floor
proceedings took more time than all but the most major issues.
   Senate committee hearings in the impeachment case against U.S.
District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida took four weeks during the
summer. His case is awaiting action by the full Senate.
   Under the Constitution, federal judges are appointed for life and
can be removed from office only by resignation, death or an
impeachment conviction by the Senate.
   Fowler said the Supreme Court has more time for these cases.
   His plan for a constitutional amendment is not the first call for
a change in the discipline of federal judges.
   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on courts, intellectual property and the administration
of justice has proposed strengthening federal laws governing the
judges and setting up a commission to study the impeachment process.
   The number of U.S. district judgeships has grown from 409 to 575
in the last 11 years and is expected to expand.
   ``Having experienced three criminal prosecutions against federal
judges in the recent past, a growing number of felony cases brought
against sitting judges can be expected as judgeships are added to
the judicial system,'' Kastenmeier said in a recent article
published in the Kentucky Law Journal.

<HEAD>Italian Newspaper Denounces Pravda in Yeltsin Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian newspaper took the Soviet newspaper Pravda
to task Friday for reprinting an article about Moscow political
maverick Boris Yeltsin ``for political purposes.''
   The article, which claimed Yeltsin had gone on a drinking and
shopping binge during a U.S. visit, was reprinted from the Italian
paper, La Repubblica, on Monday. But the Communist Party daily
apologized for reprinting it Thursday, saying the reporter who wrote
it had not seen anything of the kind.
   In an editorial and letter from the reporter, Vittorio Zucconi,
La Repubblica charged Friday that Pravda tried to use the article
for political rather than journalistic ends.
   ``The editorial board of La Repubblica deplores ... the political
use by Pravda,'' the editorial said.
   It said the reprint was part of a ``political confrontation''
taking place in Moscow.
   Yeltsin, the former Communist Party chief of Moscow, was stripped
of that post almost two years ago by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who denounced him as overly ambitious.
   In a remarkable political comeback in March, Yeltsin won 89
percent of the vote when he ran against an establishment candidate
to represent Moscow in the new national legislature, the Congress of
People's Deputies.
   The left-of-center Repubblica, one of Italy's largest newspapers,
expressed ``regret'' that Yeltsin suffered ``unjust political
damage'' from Pravda's use of its article.
   A flushed and angry Yeltsin, who returned home Monday from his
nine-city U.S. tour, accused Pravda of seeking ``revenge for the
fact that Americans received us with admiration.''
   In his letter Friday, Zucconi said he had based his account on a
Sept. 13 article in the Washington Post and on Russian emigrant
sources.
   ``If the sources gave inexact information to the Post, to us, and
to other publications which spoke with them, or if they later
changed their account in view of the fuss made by Pravda, we can
only acknowledge and offer our regrets,'' his letter said.

<HEAD>Two Suspected Collaborators Killed by Palestinian Militants</HEAD>

   Two Arabs suspected of collaborating with
Israeli authorities were killed Friday, one clubbed to death and the
other slain by fellow prison inmates, according to Palestinian and
army reports.
   They also said at least 17 Palestinians were wounded in clashes
with Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which were shut down by a general strike. The strike was called by
the underground leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization
to show solidarity with jailed activists and deportees.
   According to government statistics, 9,392 Arabs are imprisoned
including 2,124 held under administrative detention, which allows
the army to jail a suspect for up to one year without trial. Sixty
Palestinians have been deported from the occupied territories since
the anti-Israeli uprising began 21 months ago.
   In other developments, Israeli political leaders remained divided
over the Middle East peace plan proposed by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and a court acquitted a secret service agent who had been
accused of negligence in the death of a jailed Palestinian.
   Israel radio and Arab journalists said that in the Gaza Strip
town of Rafah, masked militants attacked 36-year-old Saeed Abu Jazar
with clubs near his house and beat him to death. The journalists
said Jazar was suspected of collaborating with Israel and of being a
drug dealer.
   At the Ketziot prison camp in the Negev desert, Palestinian
inmates killed another suspected collaborator, 23-year-old Karim
Abed Kareem, Arab reports said. The army confirmed the death and
said it was checking the circumstances.
   The two deaths raised to 116 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs for suspected collaboration.
   Hospital officials reported 17 Palestinians were wounded in
skirmishes with Israeli troops in three Gaza Strip refugee camps,
Jebaliya, Khan Yunis and Bureij.
   At least 573 Arabs have been killed by Israeli soldiers and
civilians since the uprising began in December. Forty Israelis have
perished in the violence.
   There were no indications of a compromise between the rival Likud
and Labor groups in Israel's coalition government over Mubarak's
peace proposals.
   Defense Minister YItzhak Rabin, speaking to members of his
center-left Labor Party, said he supported Egypt's offer to arrange
a meeting of Israelis and Palestinians, including some Palestinians
deported from the occupied territories.
   He also repeated his party's support for the principle of trading
occupied land for peace _ a point vehemently opposed by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc.
   ``Rabin is fed up with the uprising and I'm fed up with these
internal wars,'' Shamir told the newspaper Maariv. ``We should
adhere to our initiative and tell the Arabs ... if you want peace
with us you have to adopt the principles of this initiative. Let us
start negotiations without preconditions.''
   The arguments are likely to continue until early October when the
Cabinet is to discuss the matter following the return of Deputy
Premier Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens from the
United States.
   A Shin Bet secret service agent accused of negligence in the
death of a Palestinian during interrogation was found innocent by
the Jerusalem magistrates' court, an attorney for the agent said. He
said the court ruled there was lack of evidence in the case. The
agent was not identified.
   Awad Hamdan, 23, died in custody in July 1987, two days after his
arrest for allegedly belonging to an illegal organization.
   Israeli security officials reported Hamdan died of a heart attack
or was bitten by a snake. Hamdan's family took the matter to court,
saying they were told the prisoner died of suffocation but there
were torture marks on his body.

<HEAD>FDA Panel Suggests Stronger Warnings on Sleep-Drug Side Effects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee on Friday recommended strengthening warnings against side
effects of the world's leading sleep medication, Halcion, to
indicate a possibly greater risk of temporary amnesia than other
drugs in its class.
   The panel also recommended stronger warnings concerning possible
side effects of all hypnotic sleep drugs.
   The recommendations resulted from the Psychopharmacological Drugs
Advisory Committee's review of a ``relatively high'' number reports
about side effects associated with the use of Halcion compared with
other sedative-hypnotics. The reports included amnesia, anxiety,
aggression and hallucinations, all of which are included in the
current warning label for the drug.
   The panel recommended a stronger warning on amnesia only.
   The FDA has six months to act on the recommendations.
   Panel members said the number of adverse reactions reported may
not be an indication that Halcion carries greater risks of unwanted
side effects than other drugs in its class.
   ``Given the limitations of the information, we did not sense
there was a special problem'' of side effects with Halcion, said Dr.
Daniel E. Casey, panel chairman and chief of psychiatric research
and psychopharmacology at the Veterans Administration Medical Center
in Portland, Ore.
   Since Halcion was approved for sale in the United States in 1983,
about 43 million prescriptions of the drug have been written and the
FDA has received 1,693 reports of adverse side effects possibly
associated with use of the drug, ranging from amnesia to death, said
Charles Anello, deputy director of the FDA's office of epidemiology
and biostatistics.
   By comparison, 35 million prescriptions have been written for
Restoril, a sedative-hypnotic made by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp.,
since 1981 and the FDA has received 266 reports of unwanted side
effects, he said.
   Officials of The Upjohn Co., which makes Halcion, said the higher
reports for Halcion are probably partly due to media reports about
the drug.
   Publicity about the drug included an article in California
Magazine a year ago by a woman who entitled her experience with the
drug ``Halcion Nightmare,'' network television features about the
drug and reporting on a case last year in which a Utah woman shot
her mother after having taken Halcion. Charges against the woman
were dismissed.
   Upjohn spokesman Godfrey Grant said the company was ``pleased the
advisory committee has essentially come to the conclusion that there
are few if any concerns that need to be addressed.''
   The epidemiological data Upjohn presented to the panel ``does not
support a significant problem, but we did acknowledge there could be
some concern with inappropriate dosing,'' he said, referring to
higher doses of the drug.
   ``There is no emergency and we don't see a public health
hazard,'' said Paul Leber, director of the FDA's division of
neuropharmacological drug products.
   Though the committee agreed to recommend a specific relabeling
for Halcion to note that it may carry a greater risk than other
hypnotics for temporary amnesia, the panel also decided to address
concerns for the entire class of sleeping pills. Three drugs are
included in this class _ Halcion, Restoril and Dalmane, made by
Roche Products Inc.
   Committee members said they were concerned about ``traveler's
amnesia'' _ a temporary amnesia that can affect travelers who take
one of the sleep drugs. When they awake they can function normally
but later won't recall their activities during this period, such as
going through Customs at the airport, Leber said.
   The labels for these drugs already warn of amnesia as a possible
side effect, but the committee recommended the FDA consider adding
mention of ``traveler's amnesia'' to the labels.
   Panel members also asked the FDA to ``provide material to
consumers to alert to the possibility of side effects'' of the
sedative-hypnotic drugs so consumers could discuss these with their
doctor.
   ``This could be expressed in many different ways,'' panel
chairman Casey said.

<HEAD>Justice Department Declines To Make Oral Argument On Minnesota Abortion
Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department declined Friday to seek
permission to make an oral argument during the Supreme Court's
consideration of a Minnesota law resticting abortions for teen-agers.
   The decision to forgo oral argument appears to signal that the
department will not use the Minnesota case as the occasion to renew
its argument that the landmark 1973 abortion-rights decision be
overturned.
   Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said the Bush
administration still has as a legal goal the overturning of that
decision, Roe v. Wade.
   But Eramian said ``it's premature'' to say if the brief Solicitor
General Kenneth Starr still plans to file in the Minnesota case will
address that issue.
   Eramian said the department intends to join the attorney general
of Minnesota in defending the law, which requires teen-agers to
obtain the permission of parents _ even those not a part of their
lives _ to get an abortion.
   But the Minnesota case may not present the best opportunity for
the Justice Department to continue its argument that the high court
should overturn Roe v. Wade, said a department source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The solicitor general, often called the 10th justice in legal
circles, must be careful to preserve his special relationship with
the high court by not pressing legal arguments that have been
freshly rebuffed by the justices, the source said.
   It could be insulting to the justices if the Justice Department
quickly returns to the Supreme Court to raise the same legal point
that the court rejected in July when the justices refused to
overturn Roe v. Wade, the source said.
   The Justice Department specifically urged the high court to use
the Missouri case to overturn the 1973 precedent, a request made in
oral argument by former Solicitor General Charles Fried.
   The high court in that case held that the Missouri law did not
run afoul of Roe v. Wade, and therefore the 1973 precedent was left
intact even though the statute prohibited abortions in state
facilities or in hospitals on state land.
   Because it involves a law restricting the rights of teen-agers,
Hodgson v. Minnesota does not deal as squarely as the Missouri case
with the fundamental issue of a woman's constitutional right to
abortion.
   The fact that the Minnesota attorney general is not seeking to
overturn Roe v. Wade in his argument before the court may also be a
factor in the Justice Department's reasoning.
   The abortion-rights issue is a politically vexing one for
President Bush, who has shifted his stance from pro-choice to
anti-abortion in the last decade.
   Political polls taken since the Supreme Court's ruling in the
Missouri case, show that restricting abortion rights is not popular.
   A poll commissioned by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News
released Friday showed that 46 percent of those surveyed would vote
or would be likely to vote for a pro-choice candidate while 28
percent would support an anti-abortion candidate. The poll indicated
that young voters were pro-choice by a 2-1 margin.

   NASA said Friday that it still hopes
to launch space shuttle Atlantis on schedule Oct. 12 despite
disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo.
   Officials had said Thursday the launch probably would be
postponed at least two days because of preparations made to move
Atlantis off the launch pad to the safety of an assembly building in
case the storm headed this way.
   That effort was halted early Thursday when Hugo passed harmlessly
300 miles east of here.
   Electrical, communications and fuel line connections between the
pad and shuttle had been disconnected in case a move became
necessary. Those had to be reattached and retested, a task expected
to add at least two days to the launch preparation time, the
officials had said.
   ``The schedule is tight, but we feel we still have a chance to
make the Oct. 12 date,'' NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said Friday.
   A firm launch date will be set on Oct. 3 following a two-day
flight readiness review by shuttle managers.
   Atlantis will carry a crew of five astronauts who are to release
the Galileo spacecraft on the start of a six-year journey to the
planet Jupiter.
   Meanwhile, preparations moved ahead for launching a Navy
communications satellite aboard an Atlas-Centaur rocket set for
liftoff at 4:12 a.m. Monday. That launch was delayed three days
after workers drained the rocket's fuel tanks because of Hugo's
potential threat.

<HEAD>Hugo Remnants Suprise West Virginia Before It Chugs North</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hugo, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The remnants of Hurricane Hugo made a surprise sweep through West
Virginia on Friday, downing power and telephone lines, snapping
trees and causing flooding before fizzling and meandering toward
Ohio.
   ``There's basically nothing left of him,'' said weather service
meteorologist Alan Reznek in Charleston, W.Va. ``His punch is gone.''
   The center of the storm advanced farther westward than expected,
targeting eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and western New York
before it was expected to wear itself out in Canada. It was moving
to the north at 30 mph.
   Charleston, S.C., got the full brunt of Hugo, which wrecked a
string of Caribbean resort islands beginning early Sunday. There
were 20 confirmed deaths in the Caribbean, but an official on Puerto
Rico said the death toll for the region was 26 people. About 50,000
people are homeless.
   Ten of the 11 U.S. deaths were in South Carolina. Eight died in
counties surrounding Charleston and one in the Columbia area, said
Warren Hardy of the state's Office of Emergency Preparedness. In
North Carolina, a 6-month-old baby was killed in Union County when a
tree fell on a house.
   A hurricane is a heat engine fueled by warm, moist air over open
oceans. When these giant storms hit land, they lose their wallop,
although they can still manage considerable bluster.
   Hugo was downgraded into a tropical storm at 6 a.m. and decayed
more as it went inland, but places in its path could expect several
inches of rain and high winds. By 6 p.m., Hugo had lost the
characteristics of a tropical storm, although the weather system
featured maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains.
   Its last location was just west of Pittsburgh, Pa., at latitude
40.5 degrees north and longitude 81 degrees west. Officials said no
further tracking would be done.
   Earlier, Hugo was expected to skirt West Virginia. But
communities in the southern part of the state instead were lashed by
fierce winds and inundated with water.
   ``It's blowing 45 or 50 miles an hour,'' said Fred Kitts, of the
Mercer County Sheriff's Department in Princeton. ``We've had trees
fall on houses, cars, trailers. There are power lines everywhere.''
   Heavy rains brought rapidly rising water, which forced some
evacuations Friday in the Oakvale area of Mercer County, said
officials with the county's emergency services. There were no
immediate reports of injuries.
   At 4 p.m. EDT, the weather service said the center of the rapidly
weakening storm had moved out of West Virginia into southeastern
Ohio. Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center, said
the storm was expected to pass through eastern Ohio and western
Pennsylvania late Friday or early Saturday.
   The weather service issued a small stream and urban flood warning
Friday evening for Cuyahoga and Medina counties in northeast Ohio.
About 2{ inches of rain fell in Medina during a 90-minute period
late Friday afternoon.
   An outer band of the tropical storm hit Virginia's western half
earlier Friday, knocking down power lines and trees with winds
gusting as high as 81 mph and forcing residents in low-lying areas
of several counties to evacuate.
   But the eye of the storm swept through the narrowest part of the
state _ entering in Washington County and exiting in Tazwell County
_ and dumped far less rain than anticipated. Five to 10 inches of
rain was expected in areas where 3 inches or less fell.
   ``It passed a lot farther west than we thought it would and it
didn't stay here too long,'' said Janet Clements, spokeswoman for
the state Department of Emergency Services. No serious injuries were
reported.
   In Washington, government agencies, schools, transit officials
and property owners, preparing for the worst, were relieved when the
brunt of the storm missed the nation's capital.
   In New York City, rain and blustery winds were the biggest
concern. The threat of high tides and flooding and closed down the
Statue of Liberty's island.
   Emergency management coordinators in New Jersey also expected the
the worst from Hugo, but instead saw only some rainstorms and gusty
winds.

   Investigators probing the wreckage of a French
airliner that exploded over an African desert have found evidence of
explosives on board the DC-10, the government said Friday night.
   In a brief statement, the Transport Ministry said the inquiry
commission of officials from France, Niger and Chad had found
indications ``which tend to support the hypothesis of the presence
of explosives aboard the DC-10 of UTA.''
   The mysterious crash Tuesday in southern Niger killed all 171
people aboard UTA Flight 772.
   The Transport Ministry said further tests should be able to
quickly settle the question of the cause of the crash, but provided
no details of what evidence was found or what tests would be carried
out.
   Until now, French officials have refused to rule out the
possibility of an accidental explosion in flight, while agreeing
with UTA President Rene Lapautre that a bombing was the most likely
explanation for the crash. The carrier, UTA, or Union des Transports
Aeriens, is a private French company that serves Africa and the
Pacific.
   Earlier in the day, French authorities denied reports that they
had prior warnings of imminent terrorism.
   ``None of our services, none of our ministries, received either
threats or intelligence about preparations for anti-French
attacks,'' said a spokesman for President Francois Mitterrand.
   The news weekly L'Express reported Friday that the French Embassy
in Beirut urgently alerted Paris to a Lebanese magazine's reports of
terrorist plans. French intelligence agents also relayed the
warning, according to L'Express.
   On Sept. 15, the Lebanese magazine, Ash-Shiraa, quoted Islamic
militants loyal to Iran as accusing France of reneging on a 1988
deal that led to the release of three French hostages held in
Lebanon.
   It said the militants were planning attacks on French interests
in Africa.
   France has denied making any deal for the hostages, beyond
agreeing to restore diplomatic relations with Iran. There have been
reports France also agreed to free Anis Naccache, a pro-Iranian
Lebanese serving a life sentence for the attempted murder in 1980 of
former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in France. Naccache
has not been released.
   France provoked fresh resentment among Moslem groups last month
by sending warships off the Lebanese coast to protect French
citizens and sympathizers in the war-torn nation.
   A French Foreign Ministry official confirmed the embassy in
Beirut sent copies of the Ash-Shiraa article to French officials but
added, ``All our embassies send us reports regularly.''
   ``The content of the article is extremely vague,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with policy. ``You
couldn't draw the conclusion from it that there would be an attack
on a UTA plane en route from N'Djamena to Paris.''
   Ash-Shiraa gained fame for exposing secret arms deals between the
United States and Iran, but it has been wrong on several stories
concerning hostages held in Lebanon.
   N'Djamena, capital of Chad, was the DC-10's last stop before it
disintegrated. The flight originated in Brazzaville, Congo.
   In Niger, helicopters began evacuating bodies Friday to be flown
to Paris for identification. Rescue workers found the plane's voice
recorder in debris strewn widely over dunes and rocks.
   A team of American investigators joined French authorities to
examine the wreckage. Experts from McDonnell Douglas and General
Electric joined them. FBI agents also were expected to join the
investigation.
   Police were checking the plane's passenger list and the nine
people who left the plane at N'Djamena.
   Some speculation in Paris has focused on Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem group believed to be the umbrella for factions holding
most of the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Telephone calls to the airline and to reporters on Tuesday, hours
after the crash, claimed responsibility for the bombing on behalf of
Islamic Jihad, which is believed to work under Hezbollah.
   The calls were not authenticated, and French newspapers reported
without citing sources that police discounted the calls.
   In 1984, the same Brazzaville-Paris UTA flight was bombed on the
ground in N'Djamena in 1984, killing one person. Chadian authorities
blamed Libya, but investigators never established responsibility.
   Several Islamic factions threatened to fire on French ships after
France announced it would send a fleet to Lebanon. The pro-Iranian
Revolutionary Justice Organization threatened France and the Western
hostages in Lebanon.
   ``Recent events have proven that France's rulers have forgotten
the lessons and still insist on following the American criminal
policies,'' the terrorist group said in a statement this month.
   ``The Revolutionary Justice Organization ... will not allow
France to intervene in the region under any pretext.''

   Hurricane Hugo did an estimated $1 million
damage at historic Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor and may have
harmed some endangered wildlife, an Interior Department official
said Friday.
   Constance Harriman, assistant secretary of the interior for parks
and wildlife, said the storm also threatened oxygen supplies to fish
at two hatcheries.
   Meanwhile, the Interior Department announced that Secretary
Manuel Lujan would visit hard-hit Puerto Rico on Saturday, then meet
in the Virgin Islands with Gov. Alexander Farrelly on Sunday.
   Both Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor were hit
by the full force of the hurricane. The bridge from the mainland to
Sullivan's Island, where Fort Moultrie is located, collapsed.
   A 17-foot wall of water reportedly slammed into Fort Sumter,
where the first shots of the Civil War were fired. Ms. Harriman said
the storm caused an estimated $1 million in damage at the fort.
   The Park Service had not been able to make an on-site assessment,
she said, adding that the fort, some boats and a dock had been
damaged.
   Cape Romain, a national wildlife refuge near Charleston that's
home to two red wolves, was also in the path of the hurricane. The
status of the wolves, an endangered species, is unknown, she said.
   Ms. Harriman said the status of a wild flock of Puerto Rican
parrots at a research station at Boqueron, Puerto Rico, was unknown.
However, she said a captive flock at the station, maintained by the
Fish and Wildlife Service and Forest Service, was safe and that
Coast Guard was bringing in food and water for the birds by
helicopter.
   Two inland fish hatcheries in South Carolina, Orangeburg and
Bear's Bluff, were affected when problems with the power supply
caused made it difficult to get oxygen to the sturgeon and striped
bass, she said. The power was being supplemented with emergency
generators.
   ``Despite extensive damage throughout the Caribbean and the
Charleston area, National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service
properties fared relatively well,'' Ms. Harrimann said.
   ``All employees in the Caribbean are accounted for, as well as
all employees along the path of the hurricane on the mainland.
Property damage has been limited to a few areas and it consists
primarily of employee housing, some vehicle damage, some trailer
unit damage and a couple of boats.''
   She said much of the employee housing damage was at Christiansted
National Historic Site on St. Croix in the Virgin Islands, but that
valuable prehistoric artifacts at the monument, an old fort, were
not damaged. She said they were under guard during the looting that
occurred after the hurricane.
   Ms. Harriman estimated the damage to doors and windows in
auxiliary buildings at Puerto Rico's San Juan National Historic Site
at about $350,000.
   ``There has been no damage to historical structures that we know
of down in the Caribbean area,'' she said.
   Ms. Harriman also said she knew of no damage to the well-known
Cape Hatteras lighthouse off the North Carolina coast. About 1,500
trees were reported felled at King's Mountain National Military Park
on the border of South and North Carolina, she said.
   Great Smoky Mountains National Park received about 4 inches of
rain and had local flooding, she said, adding that Florida's Cape
Canaveral National Seashore had higher than usual tides but was
expected to open over the weekend.
   In West Virginia, the national New River was reported rising
rapidly and there was concern about flooding downstream, she said.
The popular Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park was closed
because of high winds and falling trees but is expected to be
reopened Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Soviet politician Boris N. Yeltsin met with
thousands of supporters on Friday and celebrated Pravda's apology
for reprinting an article claiming he drank and spent his way across
the United States on a recent tour.
   ``I'm thankful for your understanding, and for the fact that you
did not believe this lie, slander, this action that evidently was
directed against me,'' he told cheering supporters in Zelinograd, 19
miles northwest of Moscow.
   Just over 1,000 people jammed into a hall in Zelinograd and
photographers on the scene said about 20,000 more listed to his
speech on speakers outside.
   It was Yeltsin's first public appearance since he returned from a
nine-city tour of the United States on Monday. That same day, the
Communist Party daily Pravda reprinted an article by the Italian
newspaper La Repubblica saying the silver-haired populist engaged in
a drinking and spending binge in the United States.
   Pravda apologized to Yeltsin on Thursday, printing a small item
saying the journalist who wrote the story hadn't actually seen
Yeltsin do any of the things he described. Yeltsin previously
described the report as ``garbage.''
   La Repubblica on Friday apologized for the article, saying its
sources for the article misled their reporter.
   On Tuesday and Wednesday, Yeltsin took part in a full meeting of
the Communist Party Central Committee on ethnic issues. The Central
Committee has the power to take disciplinary action against its
members, including removing them from the party policy-making body.
   ``They expected after this planned action that I would declare at
the plenum that I was leaving the Central Committee,'' Yeltsin told
the crowd, which frequently interrupted him with cheers and applause
during his hourlong remarks.
   ``I was only smiling sitting in the hall,'' he added.
   Yeltsin said he also didn't back down from criticism he made of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program while in America.
   ``At the end of the plenum, Gorbachev says, `Yeltsin returned
from America. He says how good it is in America, and we were all
criticized by him, including we Central Committee members and the
Presidium headed by me,''' Yeltsin told the crowd.
   ``I told him, `Right, it was just like you describe it.'''
   Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to Moscow in 1985 to serve as Moscow
Communist Party chief, and Yeltsin quickly became a leading advocate
of Gorbachev's policy of greater openness.
   But Yeltsin was forced out of his job in November 1987 after
criticizing the party at a Central Committee meeting, and
subsequently lost his post as a candidate, or non-voting, member of
the ruling party Politburo.
   He completed a remarkable political comeback this year, first
winning 89 percent of the vote in Moscow for a seat in the new
Congress of People's Deputies, and then being chosen a leader of a
group of deputies that is the Soviet Union's first organized
legislative opposition in almost 70 years.
   Yeltsin gained wide popularity for attacking special privileges
enjoyed by top party and government officials. He also accuses
Gorbachev of proceeding too slowly in his reform program.

<HEAD>EDs: New throughout with talks break off, fresh quotes from Byrd,
Hatfield</HEAD>

   Senate talks aimed at financing the war on
drugs broke off Friday amid squabbling between Republicans and
Democrats over how much to take away from defense and provide for
drug treatment, education and prevention.
   ``There comes a time when you have to fish or cut bait,'' Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., told
reporters at the end of five days of closed-door bargaining. He said
the White House made the going tougher by being a ``shadow
participant'' in the talks.
   Failure to reach agreement threatens partisan skirmishing and a
logjam of money bills on the Senate floor with eight days to go
before the start of the new fiscal year, when the money will be
needed.
   No further negotiations were planned, although Byrd said, ``I'm
always at the other end of the telephone.'' The leader of Republican
negotiators, Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said he hoped ``we'll all
take a clear-eyed, Monday-morning view.''
   Democrats were proposing to add $1 billion to the $7.9 billion
drug-fighting program announced by President Bush. Of the extra
money, $800 million would be aimed at stemming demand for drugs
through education and prevention programs as well as treatment _ the
so-called ``demand side'' of the drug problem. The rest would go to
local law enforcement.
   The Democratic program would be financed through an
across-the-board cut of 0.3 percent in federal spending plus
additional, selected cuts to be determined by congressional
committees.
   These additional, selected cuts would be at an overall rate of
0.144 percent. Committees, however, would be free to reduce spending
in some areas more and other areas less.
   Republicans were offering to add $850 million to the program,
including $750 million for demand-side programs and the rest for
local law enforcement. It would be financed through an
across-the-board cut in spending of 0.4 percent, according to
Hatfield.
   Republicans, however, were holding out for additional flexibility
to protect defense procurement from the full brunt of
across-the-board cuts.
   Over a week of negotiations, Byrd cut his proposed increase by
more than half, and the inclusion of selected cuts which were not
part of his original proposal represented a partial concession to
the Bush administration.
   He told a news conference Republicans asked for concessions ``and
we said, okay, we'll do that, but let's beef up that treatment side,
that prevention side.'' He and other Democratic lawmakers scoffed at
the notion that their proposal would weaken defense.
   ``The administration was unwilling to let a $300 billion defense
budget bear a less than one half of one percent cut to beef up the
war on drugs,'' Sasser told reporters.
   Hatfield said that he was surprised that the Democrats did not
press on with negotiations.
   ``I was highly expectant that this was the day we were going to
finalize the agreement,'' Hatfield said. He acknowledged that at one
point the negotiators had discussed the possibility of raising the
overall increase to $900 million but that this was never
incorporated in a formal offer.
   The breakoff in talks threatened what Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn.,
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, described as ``some
procedural disorder on the floor of the United States Senate.''
   Republicans have been holding up final action on four
appropriations bills and eight others are still being fashioned in
the Senate.
   Earlier, Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said
Republican senators seemed ready to accept a billion-dollar boost
for the $7.9 billion Bush wanted. But he said there were still
problems at the White House.
   ``I believe the only obstacle or the only remaining participant
to give consent is the president,'' Mitchell said.
   Republican senators indicated the administration was concerned
about the impact on the Pentagon and added that they, too, had
concerns.
   ``To the extent that defense has to be hit, I think that we have
to impose the maximum of flexibility,'' said Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., emerging from a meeting with top administration officials.
   ``Take tanks. It would mean a severe reduction in the number of
tanks that could be produced next year,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens,
D-Alaska.

<HEAD>AM-Nixon Renews Complaint Against ABC TV Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Nixon, angered at a planned ABC
drama about his last months in office, suggested in a letter sent by
an aide Friday that the show's sponsor, AT&amp;T, change its well-known
corporate slogan to ``Reach Out and Smear Someone.''
   The letter to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. board chairman
Robert E. Allen was written and signed by the Nixon aide, John H.
Taylor.
   In a phone interview from Nixon's office in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.,
Taylor said the letter reflected the former president's views,
although he said the letter's words are his own and not those of
Nixon.
   The letter also said Nixon had cancelled his long-distance AT&amp;T
service at home, and switched to a rival company, MCI, because of
the former's sponsorship of ABC's ``The Final Days.''
   Taylor's letter included another one he sent Monday to the
government's General Services Administration, requesting a similar
switch to MCI for Nixon's office. That letter called ABC's planned
movie a ``distorted, malicious portrait of the last days of the
Nixon Administration.''
   AT&amp;T values ``all our customers, and Mr. Nixon, too,'' said Burke
Stinson, a spokesman for the company. He said AT&amp;T regrets losing
any customer, but still will sponsor the ABC movie and hopes that
viewers ``will judge for themselves'' the fairness of the film.
   The three-hour movie, to air on Oct. 29, dramatizes the
best-selling book by Bob Woodward and Carl Berstein that was their
account of Nixon's downfall in 1973 and 1974 during the Watergate
scandal. Nixon, portrayed in the movie by actor Lane Smith, resigned
in August, 1974.
   Among other things, the book depicts Nixon in his final White
House days as a deeply disturbed man who once reportedly talked to
portraits hanging on the White House walls. Nixon, through friends
and his lawyers, have denied such allegations.
   In his letter for Nixon, which he made available to a reporter,
Taylor enclosed an eight-page complaint about the movie that Nixon's
attorney, William E. Griffin, sent last March to Capital Cities-ABC
Inc. chairman Thomas S. Murphy, head of the network's parent company.
   That complaint, Taylor said, includes what his letter to Allen
called a ``summary of criticism'' by journalists in major newspapers
and publications in their reviews of the book upon its publication
in 1976.
   ``In view of the highly questionable nature of the book even in
their eyes,'' Taylor wrote Allen, ``perhaps you should change your
corporate slogan to `Reach Out and Smear Someone.' ''
   Stinson, whose company's catch phrase is ``Reach Out and Touch
Someone,'' declined to comment on Taylor's suggestion.
   Much of the journalistic criticism cited by Taylor's letter
centered on the book's literary form and use of anonymous sources.
Woodward, a Washington Post editor, has said he and Bernstein stand
by the accuracy of what they wrote.
   Griffin's complaint to ABC's chief executive implied the
possibility of a lawsuit in an area of law that lawyers call the
``right of publicity,'' or the right to commercially exploit one's
own name and image.
   Nixon, his attorney's letter said, ``objects strongly to being
depicted by an actor without his consent.
   ``It is his contention that being depicted in this manner purely
for the profit of Capital Cities-ABC and for the entertainment of
its audience is a violation of his privacy and an infringement of
his right to use his name and image to promote his own writings and
statements about foreign policy and other issues facing our nation
and the world.''
   No specific threat of a lawsuit was made. Taylor, who said Nixon
had authorized the complaint that his lawyer sent to ABC, said he
didn't know if a lawsuit would be filed against ABC if it aired
``The Final Days.''
   Dick Connelly, an ABC spokesman, confirmed that the company had
been ``contacted by President Nixon's attorney'' and that ``our
general counsel responded to his letters.''
   He declined to say how many letters ABC had received from Nixon's
lawyer, or how ABC replied to them.
   However, he said, referring to ABC's movie about Nixon, ``we did
not modify the program. We are satisfied with its fairness and
accuracy, and believe this production will speak for itself.''

   Swiss companies acted legally in helping

poison gas, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said Friday.
   It said it had dropped its investigation.
   Officials refused to reveal the names of the firms investigated.
   The United States said it had evidence the factory near Rabta,
Libya, about 35 miles outside Tripoli, was on the verge of producing
chemical weapons. Libya said the plant was for pharmaceutical
production.

   Here is a summary of developments Friday associated with
Hurricane Hugo:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DISASTER DECLARED</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush declared seven counties of South Carolina a
disaster area, making the state eligible for federal loans for
rebuilding, repairs, and restoration of utilities.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ELEVEN DEATHS REPORTED</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Ten deaths were reported in South Carolina, eight of them in
counties surrounding Charleston and one near Columbia, S.C., and one
person died in North Carolina.
   Earlier, at least 20 people, and as many as 26, died as the storm
surged across the Caribbean.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE STORM</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Hugo was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. Friday. By 6
p.m., Hugo had all but lost the characteristics of a tropical storm
and was weakening, although the weather system featured maximum
sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains. Its last location
was in Pennsylvania, just west of Pittsburgh, at latitude 40.5
degrees north and longitude 81 degrees west. Officials said no
further tracking would be done.
   The storm was expected to wear out in Canada.
   Threats of severe flooding were eased because the storm was
moving faster than expected.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LANDFALL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The center of the storm made landfall about midnight Thursday
over the Isle of Palms, just east of Charleston. S.C.
   The hurricane passed through Charleston with winds of 135 mph and
gusts even higher. Flooding was worsened since the impact, carrying
a wall of water 12 to 17 feet high, coincided with high tide at 2:13
a.m.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DAMAGE and FLOODING</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty buildings in downtown Charleston, S.C., were flattened,
houses collapsed all over the city, and several people were trapped
beneath a collapsed condominium complex. Fires erupted from natural
gas leaks.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. estimated damage at $1 billion.
   Elsewhere along the coast, Garden City Beach, S.C., a small
vacation community south of Myrtle Beach, was largely leveled. At
least 14 houses on Pawleys Island were washed away. Three piers
disappeared in North Myrtle Beach, Cherry Grove, and Garden City
Beach.
   In Charlotte, N.C., 200 miles inland, power was out in 85 percent
of the city, and downed trees blocked roadways and damaged homes.
High winds, clocked at up to 75 mph, felled a 1,000-foot television
transmission tower and broke windows in a 42-story downtown office
building.
   At least 900,000 customers in the Carolinas were without
electrical power Friday.
   As the storm moved northward, coastal areas were largely spared
but inland flooding was reported.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LAW ENFORCEMENT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said more than 3,000
National Guardsmen and law enforcement officials were on duty.
   Campbell said there had been looting in the Surfside Beach and
Garden City area, but the National Guard had quickly secured the
area.
   Charleston Mayor Riley ordered a curfew from 6 p.m. until 7 a.m.
every night until the damage is cleaned up.
   About 175 Guardsmen were deployed in North Carolina to assist
local authorities. The state ordered evacuation of 90 prisoners at
Yancey Correctional Center at Burnsville as a precaution because of
rapidly rising waters in the Cana River.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CARIBBEAN</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   On St. Croix, Virgin Islands, officials said patrolling U.S.
troops sent to restore order had curbed rampant looting.
   The Marine Radio Band said Thursday that two looters were shot in
St. Croix, but there was no independent confirmation.
   In Washington, the Interior Department said it will staff phones
24 hours for people concerned about relatives in the Virgin Islands.
The number is 202-343-6816.

   Here is a chronology of Hurricane Hugo's destructive path across
the Caribbean into South Carolina:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Sept. 11 _ Forecasters monitor new tropical wave forming off West
Africa, southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.
   Sept. 12 _ Storm reaches the 39 mph tropical storm threshold and
is named Hugo.
   Sept. 13 _ Hugo develops into a hurricane as winds reach 74 mph.
Storm is about 1,000 miles east of the Lesser Antilles island chain.
   Sept. 14 _ Winds increase to 115 mph; storm is 650 miles east of
Lesser Antilles.
   Sept. 15 _ Winds reach 150 mph. Storm, designated a Category 4
hurricane, is considered ``extremely dangerous.'' Located 340 east
miles of French territorial island of Guadeloupe.
   Sept. 16 _ Hugo bears down on Guadeloupe and Dominica with winds
reaching 140 mph.
   Sept. 17 _ Eye of Hugo is directly over Guadeloupe. Guadeloupe is
devasted by winds measuring up to 150 mph. Five people are reported
killed, 84 injured and more than 15,000 homeless on the island of
340,000 people. Roofs were torn off, power lines downed and crops
damaged.
   Sept. 17 _ Hugo hits British island of Montserrat. Nine people
are killed and hundreds of buildings are flattened. The British
government says nearly all of the 12,000 island residents are
homeless.
   Sept. 17 _ On Antigua, two people are killed and there is
widespread wind and rain damage. Island hotels report water and wind
damage.
   Sept. 17 _ No casualties are reported on the island of St. Kitts,
but houses are damaged and communications nearly severed.
   Sept. 17 _ On the British Virgin Islands, trees are uprooted and
power and communications knocked out. On the resort island of
Tortola, residents say there are numerous injuries and scores of
homes destroyed.
   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the popular tourist islands of St.
Croix and St. Thomas are hard hit. At least one person is reported
killed on St. Croix. Early reports say 97 percent of the buildings
were damaged or destroyed on St. Croix, population 53,000. Sailboats
were blown out of the water and thrown up to 150 feet on shore in
St. Thomas. Some waterfront businesses disappeared. On St. Croix,
widespread looting is reported, including raids by machete-wielding
gangs. Some reports say prisoners escaped from jail and were roaming
free and National Guardsman and police were joining in the looting.
   Sept. 18 (daybreak) _ Hugo crosses the northeast corner of Puerto
Rico. Damage is estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars and
homes of at least 50,000 people were destroyed or damaged. At least
three people are killed. National Guardsmen were aiding the cleanup
and trying to stop widespread looting. The Pentagon said some of its
facilities, including U.S. Naval Station at Roosevelts Roads in
Puerto Rico, were heavily damaged.
   Sept. 19 _ On the Bahamas, islanders boarded up homes and stocked
up as Hugo moved westward. The storm brushes past the islands, with
minimal damage, moving on a course parallel to the islands.
   Sept. 20 _ Headed toward the southeast coast of the United
States, Hugo has winds of 105-125 mph.
   Sept. 21 _ Hugo picks up speed and power. Winds reach 135 mph.
Hurricane is again classified as a Category 4 hurricane, capable of
extreme damage.
   Sept. 21 (midnight) _ Hugo crashes into Charleston, S.C., with
winds of 135 mph, leveling buildings and flooding streets. In
addition to flooding, fires from natural gas leaks erupt in
Charleston. Several other coastal communities also suffer heavy
damage. Ten people in the Carolinas are killed.
   Sept. 22 _ The hurricane, with steadily diminishing winds,
continues to move inland and is downgraded to a tropical storm.
Further weakening is expected as it moves north with its load of
heavy rain.
   Sept. 22 _ Hugo was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m.
Friday. Twelve hours later it had all but lost the characteristics
of a tropical storm and was weakening, although the weather system
featured maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains. Its
last location was just west of Pittsburgh, Pa., at latitude 40.5
degrees north and longitude 81 degrees west. Officials said no
further tracking would be done.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday
suspended licenses of the pilot and copilot of a USAir jetliner that
skidded into New York's East River, but the pilots' union said the
crew broke no rules.
   FAA Administrator James B. Busey cited the crew's delay in
meeting with investigators and in taking drug and alcohol tests
after the crash that killed two people Wednesday night, calling
their actions ``highly questionable.''
   The Air Line Pilots Association said there was ``nothing unusual
in the crew's performance, no federal rules were broken, and the
crew has cooperated completely with the investigation.''
   In a statement announcing suspension of the crew's pilot
certificates, the FAA did not directly blame the pilots for the
crackup of the 737-400 airliner carrying 61 people but said the
circumstances of the accident are such that the two pilots ``may no
longer be qualified to excercise the privileges of an Airline
Transport Pilot Certificate.''
   National Transportation Safety Board and FAA investigators
interviewed the pilot, Michael Martin, and co-pilot, Constantine
Kleissaf, for the first time on Friday, the FAA said.
   The agency had ordered Martin and Kleissaf to appear at its
regional headquarters in the Jamaica section of New York City's
Queens borough, with their pilot certificates, logbooks and other
relevant documents. It lifted that order after the two were
interviewed, the FAA said.
   Officials have been trying to determine why the plane's
late-night takeoff for Charlotte, N.C., was aborted after it had
started down the LaGuardia Airport runway.
   A pilot's suspension may be appealed to safety board
administrative law judges. Either the pilot or the FAA may appeal
the judges' decision to the five-member board whose actions are
binding unless taken by the pilot to U.S. District Court. The
suspensions remain in effect while under appeal.
   Busey said the failure of the pilots to appear in the hours after
the crash negated the opportunity to get meaningful toxicological
tests, ``thereby denying us factual information as to whether drugs
were or were not a factor.''
   An FAA rule requiring post-accident toxicological tests for
pilots goes into effect later this year.
   ``For these two pilots to have been sequestered for more than 36
hours after an accident that took two lives and to do so with no
explanation is highly quesitionable,'' Busey said.
   The pilots union said that the captain and first officer followed
standard ALPA procedures after the accident and that USAir knew the
pilot's whereabouts at all times.
   The union, in a statement, said the cockpit crew would take drug
tests.
   The union criticized the news media for what it said were
erroneous accounts about the crash.
   It said one report that the first officer told rescue workers the
captain was ``mumbling'' and ``acting irrationally'' are likely
based on the fact that the copilot told rescue workers at the
accident site that he could not hear the captain when he was calling
out a post-accident shutdown checklist.
   Union president Henry A. Duffy said reports concerning drug use,
pending homicide investigatons and improper crew communications
proved to be wrong.
   ``While we understand the new media's need to report events,''
Duffy said, ``such erroneous reporting does not serve the public's
need to know, hinders the accident investigation process, undermines
the public confidence in the safety of the system and slanders the
reputation of hte pilots involved.''
   The union statement included no reaction to the license
suspensions.

<TEXT>
   Kenyan officials said Friday that Somali
forces killed ``many people'' in a sweep through southern Somalia
before attacking a Kenyan border town in six armored cars and three
jeeps, killing at least four policemen.
   Some sources suggested the Somali soldiers were chasing members
of a newly formed rebel group.
   ``Our people who visited the site were told by the Somalis
fleeing into Kenya that they were lucky to have escaped and that
those who did not make it across the border were mowed down by
gunfire,'' Foreign Minister Robert Ouko told a news conference
Friday.
   Ouko said he did not know how many Somalis were killed in the
violence Wednesday or if it was continuing. But he said hundreds of
refugees were still pouring into Kenya each day across the eastern
border with Somalia.
   Four Kenyan policemen were killed, four people were wounded, and
one person was missing after Somali forces raced into the border
town of Liboi and started ``shooting wildly'' without provocation,
said Ouko.
   He said a nearby telecommunications station was badly damaged and
looted of firearms and ammunition.
   Ouko gave no reason for the attacks. He said Kenya strongly
protested to the Somali charge d'affaires but received no
explanation.
   ``We received a note yesterday ... that the Somalis were planning
to carry out an investigation ... We have heard nothing since,''
said Ouko.
   Liboi, 155 miles northeast of Nairobi, lies across from the
Somali town of Doble. The Somali army reportedly raided that town
last month, when an estimated 5,000 Somalis fled across the border
into Kenya.
   An insurgency calling itself the Somali Patriotic Front emerged
in opposition to the Somali government after those raids.
   Sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday's
violence occurred as Somali forces pursued the rebels near Doble.
   It was not immediately possible to get comment from Somali
government officials either in Kenya or Somalia.
   In northern Somalia, far from the Kenyan border, the Somali
government has been waging a 6-year-old battle against rebels. In
recent months reports have surfaced of government opposition in

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has been
battered by talk radio hosts since the state's budget and his
popularity took a nosedive, but Friday it was Mike's turn at the
mike.
   Sailing past technical glitches and unruly questioners, the
governor entered the precarious world of live radio for the debut of
a new show, as yet unnamed, that will be broadcast in western
Massachusetts on a regular basis.
   ``You're on the air, this is Gov. Mike Dukakis,'' the governor
greeted callers, many of whom wanted to talk about state budget cuts.
   Guided by a few index cards, Dukakis monitored the show from
WSPR-AM's temporary quarters on the fairgrounds of the Big E, New
England's largest state fair, a September fixture in western
Massachusetts. A small knot of bystanders stopped by the striped
awning to watch the governor, whose show struck a serious note amid
the gaudy hustle and bustle of the fair.
   At the beginning of the show, a technical problem cut off a
caller concerned about cuts to education. As the station manager
made rolling motions with his hands, an unphased Dukakis answered by
saying Massachusetts is ``one state in the nation that understands
the importance of education.''
   Another caller made the unusual request that Dukakis intercede in
the case of political extremist Lyndon Larouche, aquestion he turned
aside as a problem of the federal, not state government.
   Dukakis fielded questions about abortion, welfare for aliens and
the disbursement of state cars. One caller, angry about a proposed
prison in the town of New Braintree, accused Dukakis of lying when
he said the state now owns the property in question.
   Dukakis was unruffled.
   ``No, I'm not lying,'' he said. ``You're wrong sir, I'm sorry,''
he said as the caller continued to insist the governor was mistaken.
   After the show, Dukakis said he enjoyed his stint as host and
wasn't deterred by the hostile questioner.
   ``You have that on talk shows,'' he said.
   Dukakis has had some previous broadcasting experience. In the
1970s he was host of a show called ``The Advocates'' on public
television that featured roundtable discussions of controversial
issues.
   Friday, bystander Gail Rollins said she and her family listened
to the show as they were driving to the fairgrounds and came to see
it live. Rollins, from the town of Goshen, said the talk show is a
good idea.
   ``People in western Massachusetts always feel like the state ends
from Worcester over,'' she said. Worcester is about 45 miles west of
Boston.

   East German leader Erich Honecker has recovered
enough from gallbladder surgery to return to work next week, Western
sources in East Berlin said Friday.
   Illness forced Honecker to leave a Warsaw Pact summit meeting in
Romania on July 8. East Germany's state news media reported at the
time that he was suffering from gallstones.
   Honecker, 77, underwent the surgery in mid-August. He has
remained out of public view, prompting speculation and reports he
was seriously ill. East German officials denied the reports.
   The Western sources in East Berlin on Friday said Honecker's
health has improved and he was expected to resume work Monday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Honecker
was still recuperating Friday morning in East Berlin's Buch hospital.
   The hard-line Communist leader, who has led East Germany since
1971, has staunchly resisted reforms sweeping much of the Soviet
bloc.

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Puerto Ricans remained without
running water Friday and 20,000 were still housed in shelters four
days after Hurricane Hugo blew across the island.
   Large parts of San Juan, the capital, and several towns in the
northeast were still without power and 70 percent of the Caribbean
island remained without tap water Friday, officials said. Hundreds
of residents in San Juan stood in long lines waiting for water, ice
and gasoline.
   When Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon arrived in the north coast town
of Canovanas on Friday to inspect local shelters, angry residents
complained they had received no govenment aid since the storm.
   ``We're all in the street. We don't have any food, water or
light. Our houses blew away,'' local resident Gladys Cruz told the
governor.
   Hernandez Colon said the federal government's ``inexplicable
excuses'' were responsible for delays in the delivery of four pumps
for Puerto Rico's main dam to replace those damaged by the storm.
The pumps arrived Friday in this U.S. commonwealth.
   The Carraizo Dam east of San Juan provides water to several
northern towns and the capital, where a third of the island's
population of 3.3 million live.
   The civil defense director in the west coast town of Mayaguez,
Anibal Roman, said he would request police escorts for truck convoys
of food to San Juan from his town, which was untouched by the
hurricane. He said he feared hurricane victims would ``attack us and
take away the merchandise.''
   The government said on Friday, 20,000 people remained in
shelters, including schools and churches.
   In its sweep across the northeastern Caribbean on Sunday and
Monday, Hugo wrecked thousands of homes, snapped power and
communication lines, and killed at least 20 people, including six on
Puerto Rico. Civil defense authorities say 26 died in the Caribbean
but only 20 have been detailed in an island-by-island breakdown.
   It was the worst storm to hit this island since Hurricane Betsy
killed 16 people on Aug. 12, 1956.
   Federal authorities said 80 percent of the El Yunque rainforest,
a mountain-top national park on the island's eastern end, was
ravaged by Hugo's 125 mph winds.
   Most of the forest's trees were knocked down, and all the leaves
were blown off, leaving the park a brown wasteland. Park authorities
said it could take up to 10 years for the forest to replenish itself.
   The park is the only tropical forest in the U.S. national forest
system.
   Authorities on Friday continued cleaning up Roosevelt Roads naval
base in Ceiba, on the east coast.
   At the base, the largest U.S. military installation outside the
continental United States, buildings were destroyed and water, power
and communications were knocked out when Hugo passed directly over
it. Ships and planes, however, escaped damage, officials said.

<HEAD>Chinese Party Chief Says Reforms to Continue, Within Limits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China will not abandon reform policies adopted in
the past but they should enhance the Communist Party and improve
socialism, party chief Jiang Zemin said Friday.
   Jiang, in an editorial on the front-page of the Communist Party's
People's Daily, also said China will maintain its open-door policy
within the guidelines of party directives.
   The official Xinhua News Agency paraphrased Jiang as saying,
``China will resolutely carry out reforms of both economic and
political structures, but these reforms should enhance and perfect
the party leadership and consolidate and perfect the socialist
system.''
   Xinhua said Jiang made the comments at a meeting of local party
representatitives also attended by government leaders including
Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun.
   The People's Daily editorial acknowledged there was concern both
in China and abroad that the crackdown on dissent could mean an end
to reform and open-door policies.
   The suppression of dissent began with the June 3-4 army attacks
on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing in which hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of civilians were killed.
   China's goals are to develop socialism and liberate productive
forces, which can be achieved only through an open-door policy, the
editorial said.
   ``This cannot be done unless the closed-door system is destroyed
and the ossified ways changed. We must never return to the old,
closed system,'' it added.
   But the editorial declared that the party's policies did not mean
China would adopt a capitalist system or Western ideas.
   It said the nation's policies cannot be separated from correct
political ideology and the leadership of the party.
   Xinhua reported Jiang said Friday that the party had made
mistakes but has corrected them. It did not say if Jiang mentioned
any specific mistakes.
   It quoted him as warning of subversion from ``international and
domestic hostile forces'' that seek to destroy the communist system
and overthrow the party leadership.
   Li Peng has said several times this month that martial law,
imposed May 20, cannot be lifted at the present because of the
threat of internal and external subversion.

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Hugo Poses Threat of Heavy Rain In The Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo lost some of its fury as it roared northward
Friday, fading to a tropical storm and then dwindling to an unnamed
storm that nevertheless brought heavy rain and the threat of
flooding from Tennessee to New York.
   Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches were possible in the storm's
path, and forecasters warned that isolated tornadoes were possible
from Virginia to Pennsylvania.
   The storm produced 6 inches of rain at Savannah, Ga., in 24 hours.
   Hurricane Hugo packed winds of 135 mph as it hit the South
Carolina coast Wednesday night. Its eye passed just east of
Charleston, moved northwest to just west of Sumter and entered North
Carolina just west of Charlotte.
   The strong wind downed thousands of trees, damaged roofs,
destroyed homes, blew over signs and bent steel towers to the
ground. Hugo dumped 3.16 inches of rain in about 12 hours at
Charlotte, and during the early morning produced wind to 69 mph with
gusts to 87 mph.
   Thunderstorms associated with Hugo also produced wind gusts to 60
mph at Myrtle Beach, S.C., and wind gusts to 109 mph at Sumter, S.C.
At Snowshoe, W.Va., wind Friday gusted to 60 mph.
   Tree damage was so extensive in North Carolina that the state
forest service had to be called in to help clear the debris and
downed trees.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from Mississippi and Alabama
to the lower Great Lakes region and New York state Friday afternoon.
Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 8 a.m. EDT
included 3 inches at Savannah, Ga., 1 inch at Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
and .98 inches at Birmingham, Ala.
   Strong northwesterly winds were ushering cold Canadian air into
the north central United States. Showers and thurderstorms were
reported over southwest Texas and southern New Mexico.
   Forecasters posted flood watches for western Massachusetts and
western Connecticut and flash flood watches for Vermont and eastern
New York state. They posted overnight freeze warnings for Minnesota,
South Dakota, northwest Iowa and northern and west-central Wisconsin.
   The cold spot in the nation Friday was West Yellowstone, Mont.,
with a low of 26 degrees.
   Afternoon temperatures were warming into the 80s across the
southern Atlantic Coast and from south-central Texas through eastern
Texas to the central Gulf Coast; in the 90s in the desert Southwest;
in the 40s across the Dakotas, eastern Montana and northern
Minnesota.

<TEXT>
   A judge Friday sentenced 10 current and former high
school athletes to prison terms of up to 25 years for their roles in
a string of armed robberies in the Dallas area over the past year.
   ``The defendants ... in six months time committed more armed
robberies than Bonnie and Clyde did in a lifetime,'' said State
District Judge Joe Kendall. ``If stupidity were a crime, you would
all deserve life without parole.''
   Kendall ordered an 11th youth sent to a prison boot camp for
young offenders, and another received deferred adjudication for
their parts in 21 robberies in Dallas and suburban Duncanville.
    Kendall sentenced the teen-agers, including a former high school
All-America football player, after they pleaded guilty to holding up
several restaurants, including some where they worked.
   Each of the defendants faced a maximum 99-year prison sentence.
   Before sentencing, Kendall lectured the youths for about 10
minutes, telling them they had no excuse for committing the crimes.
Sentenced one by one, most of the defendants hung their heads as the
judge ruled.
   Derric Evans, 17, an All-America defensive back at Dallas Carter
High last year who lost a full scholarship to the University of
Tennessee, received a 20-year term for his involvement in four
robberies.
   Evans slumped in his chair after his sentenced was announced.
   Gary Edwards, 17, another football player who played a prominent
role in Carter's run to a state championship last fall, was
sentenced to 16 years on three counts.
   Keith Campbell, 18, received a 25-year term for his involvement
in four robberies. Kendall called Campbell a ``sociopath'' and said
he was a ringleader. Seven others were sentenced to prison terms
ranging from 2 years to 16 years.
   Many of the youths testified over the past month that they
committed at least one aggravated robbery each so they could have
extra cash for prom night. Others said they spent the money on trips
to an amusement park, fast food meals and athletic shoes.

   Motorists can be arrested for leaving an accident
scene or can lose their license for refusing to undergo drug
testing, but airline pilots are under no such legal obligations,
aviation officials and legal experts said.
   The issue of how long flight crew members must stay at an
accident scene, and how soon they must speak with investigators, was
raised by the crash of a USAir jetliner into the East River on
Wednesday night.
   The pilot, Michael Martin, left the scene shortly after his
Boeing 737 skidded off a LaGuardia Airport runway, killing two
passengers, and was not interviewed by investigators for more than
36 hours.
   Federal officials disagreed on whether his absence hampered the
crash investigation. A spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration said its investigators had been unable to contact the
pilot, and could not say what caused the accident until they learned
why he aborted the takeoff.
   But a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board _
which ran the investigation _ said the absence of the pilot was not
unusual and had not impeded the probe, and that the pilot and
co-pilot had agreed Thursday to be interviewed on Friday afternoon.
   ``It's not at all unusual for us not to interview a pilot on the
same day as the accident,'' said the spokesman, Ted Lopatkiewicz.
   Pilots also are not required to submit to alcohol and drug
testing after accidents. Automobile drivers who refuse to undergo
such tests face an automatic license suspension in most states.
   Most states have laws making it a crime for a driver to leave the
scene of a serious motor vehicle accident, but ``there's no statue
or regulation that requires a (flight) crew to stay at the scene, or
even talk with us,'' said Michael Benson, a spokesman for the safety
board in Washington.
   Crew members almost always make themselves available, however,
and the board has the power to subpoena them to appear before its
investigators. Those who are interviewed have the right to be
accompanied by an attorney.
   When it takes an NTSB investigations team several hours to reach
a crash scene, as it did in the case of the USAir crash, the pilot
and other crew members frequently have left the scene, if for no
other reason than to seek treatment of injuries.
   But Benson said the situation in New York was complicated by the
involvement of local police _ ``very unusual in an airline crash,''
he said _ who reached the scene soon after the accident and were
frustrated by the pilot's departure.
   Patricia Goldman, USAir's chief spokeswoman, and negligence
lawyer Mark Moller, a member of the American Bar Association's
committee on torts, agreed that it was not unusual for pilots to be
sequestered by their union, their airline or their lawyers
immediately after a crash.
   ``Usually, the likelihood is he's going to be in pretty bad shape
after an accident, and anything he says can be used against him,''
Moller said.
   Airlines have their own rules for flight crew conduct during and
after accidents. Goldman would not comment specifically on USAir's
rules, except to say that they require a pilot who has not been
injured to stay at the scene of an accident until the passengers are
off the plane.

<TEXT>
   A man who spent nearly 14 years in prison
for a murder he says he didn't commit and to which another man
confessed said Friday he wants to do more than clear his name.
   Darrel F. Parker filed a $12.5 million lawsuit in federal court
against the city of Lincoln, Lancaster County and a former police
chief, claiming his rights were violated by his imprisonment and
denial of a pardon.
   ``It's probably difficult for people to accept my story,'' said
Parker, 57, who lives in Moline, Ill.
   Parker was convicted in the Dec. 14, 1955, strangulation of Nancy
Parker, his wife of 19 months, in a house the couple shared in
Lincoln's Antelope Park.
   He confessed to the killing after his arrest, but later said
police coerced the statement from him.
   Last year, Parker learned that a murderer on death row told his
lawyers that he had killed Mrs. Parker. The man gave them intimate
details of the killing, but made them promise not to reveal his
confession until after his death. He died of a heart attack in July
1988.
   Parker's civil rights action names former Lincoln Police Chief
Joe Carroll, the city of Lincoln and Lancaster County. It seeks $2.5
million in compensation and $10 million in punitive damages.
   Parker said he initially just wanted to clear his name, but ``the
money is a factor.''
   ``There's lost salary, the inability to have and rear a family
... and who can put a price tag on that,'' he said.
   The lawsuit alleges that police brought in John Reid, a Chicago
criminologist and polygraph expert known for his ability to get
confessions, and accuses Reid of illegally inducing Parker to
confess. Reid has since died.
   ``There had been a murder in Omaha earlier that year and the
people in Lincoln were frightened,'' Parker recalled. ``There was a
mass hysteria, the media seized on that and this was known as the
`no-sex after breakfast murder.'''
   Prosecutors contended that Parker killed his wife after breakfast
because she refused to have sex with him before he left for work.
   ``That's just not true,'' Parker said. ``I was young. The police
were experienced. They wanted a confession, they wanted to solve the
murder.''
   Parker was released in 1969 after an appeals court said his
rights had been violated. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered a new
hearing to determine whether the confession could be used. It also
ordered a new trial.
   The trial never was held. An agreement between defense and
prosecution attorneys called for commuting Parker's life sentence
and granting him parole in exchange for his withdrawal of issues
stemming from his confession.
   He chose parole because ``you have to lay some things aside and
get on with living and hope that some evidence will come along
someday that will straighten things out,'' Parker said.
   When he found out last year about Wesley Peery's death row
confession, he decided to try to clear his name.
   ``The past year has been a roller coaster of emotions for us,''
said Eleanor Parker, Parker's wife of 19 years.
   The Board of Pardons on Dec. 15, 1988, denied Parker a pardon
hearing. Attorney General Robert Spire, a member of the three-person
board, said Parker had other ways to clear his name.
   ``The governor refused to answer my correspondence, the pardon
board didn't want to let me have a hearing, so, 34 years later, here
I am, ready to do battle,'' Parker said.
   Calls to Carroll's Lincoln home went unanswered Friday. Earlier
this year, he told a Lincoln newspaper, ``I don't just think he
(Parker) was guilty; I know he was guilty.''

<TEXT>
   A man from Barcelona who copies famous works of art
brought 244 of them to London and sold them all Friday for $238,600.
   ``They represent the work of about six months in my studio,''
said the painter Miguel Canals in an interview during the sale.
   ``I am an artist and this is my hobby but as I am a Catalan,
people say it's my business,'' he confided as auctioneer Nicholas
Bonham briskly rattled through the copied Titians, Monets, Goyas and
van Goghs.
   They took from 20 to 40 seconds to sell for a few hundred dollars
each in the packed Bonhams salesroom in Chelsea.
   ``I am happy with the prices,'' said Canals, a short, dark man in
his mid-50s, watching the sale impassively with his wife Fernanda.
   From across the floor the Renaissance Madonnas, Dutch interiors,
English hunting scenes, life-size portraits and sun-kissed
impressionists looked very much like their celebrated originals.
   Some had been treated to look aged, and tiny, deliberate mistakes
could sometimes be spotted, ``so that future experts will be able to
distinguish them from the originals,'' said Bonham.
   Naturally, a copy of the world's most expensive painting, Vincent
van Gogh's ``Irises,'' was there. The original sold for nearly $54
million at Sotheby's in New York in 1987 but cost only $4,080 after
40 seconds' bidding on Friday.
   Top price was $7,500 for a canvas after Claude Monet of the
bridge over the artist's famous waterlily pool in his garden at
Giverny near Paris.
   The Canals are the same size as the originals, in the same media
_ oil, pastel, crayon or watercolor _ and set in elaborately gilded
plaster or wood frames. On a quick glance they appear to be the real
thing. Each is stamped on the back, ``From the Studio of Miguel
Canals.''
   Among the buyers were interior decorators who said the pictures
would look good in smart homes and restaurants.
   Irish rock singer Bob Geldof looked in and said: ``I think these
are a good buy. After all, half the paintings hanging on the walls
of the world's museums are fakes.''
   Merle Birkmyre, a Londoner, said when asked why anyone would buy
one of the paintings from Spain: ``I feel people will buy a copy of
a painting after growing up with a print of it or which they love.''
   An attorney who specified that he not be identified _ ``because I
have two van Gogh original drawings'' _ said he bought a ``van
Gogh'' and a ``Seurat'' because ``they look authentic and they will
look very nice, and most of my friends won't know the difference
from the originals by midnight.''
   One copy of a familiar beach scene by Eugene Boudin, was
miscataloged as ``After Eugene Canals.''
   ``That's wrong,'' said Bonham to giggles from the floor. ``This
is definitely a Boudin.''
   It went for $600.
   Bonham said later that Canals' clients include owners of very
expensive works of art who commission him to paint a copy for the
wall while they keep the original in a safe.
   Canals has half-a-dozen assistants who may all work on one
painting as each is a specialist in something _ faces, dresses,
flowers, trees or ships.
   He said, yes, he also paints originals _ ``but it is not
important.''

<TEXT>
   Students sang victory chants Friday when
the Supreme Court issued a ruling legalizing a pro-Solidarity
student union and said the union has the right to strike.
   Students, joined by professors and members of parliament,
celebrated the decision in the hallways of the Warsaw courthouse.
   When the ruling was read in the courtroom crowded with more than
100 people there were chants of ``NZS, NZS'' _ the Polish initials
for the Independent Students Association.
   NZS had been banned after the imposition of martial law in
December 1981. Martial law, subsequently lifted, was used to suspend
and then outlaw Solidarity, the first free union movement in the
Soviet bloc. The union had been chartered by the government in 1980
during nationwide strikes.
   Solidarity was legalized last April following lengthy
negotiations and scored such stunning victories in summer elections
that it and two minor parties were able to form the new coalition
government, ending four decades of communist rule.
   NZS had insisted on the right to strike over political and school
issues, and that demand had blocked legalization of the association
after the Solidarity-government agreement in April.
   NZS is Poland's largest student union with organizations in
universities and high schools.
   It was formed in 1980, along with Solidarity, and became a
popular alternative to the Communist-sanctioned Polish Students
Association.
   NZS was denied legal registration last May when a court declared
that a new labor did not apply to students and they could not claim
the right to strike. The association refused to change its charter,
which claims strike rights.
   Even after it was banned, NZS supported Solidarity demonstrations
and organized its own to protest outdated equipment and the lack of
research and library materials and other shortages.
   ``We've been functioning anyway but it is nice to be legal
again,'' one student in the courtroom said.
   Pressure to legalize NZS increased as the Oct. 2 start of the new
academic year approached. There was concern that failure to register
the association would be met by student protests that could create
instability as the new Solidarity-led government tries to reverse
Poland's economic crisis.

<HEAD>Precedent In Embryo Case Will Await Higher Court Ruling</HEAD>

   A judge's ruling in a divorce battle over
seven frozen human embryos that life begins at conception must
withstand the test of higher courts before it sets a precedent in
the debate over reproductive rights, law specialists said Friday.
   ``It's one decision at this point,'' said Elizabeth Bartholet, an
expert in family and reproductive law at Harvard Law School.
   Neil P. Cohen of the University of Tennessee Law School said the
ultimate decision will be determined by higher appellate courts,
perhaps even the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``And those are the decisions we'll look to for guidance on this
issue,'' he said.
   Lori Andrews, medical law projects director at the American Bar
Foundation in Chicago, said that even in this formative stage,
Circuit Judge W. Dale Young's decision Thursday in the case of Mary
Sue Davis vs. Junior Lewis Davis will have to be weighed carefully
by judges facing similar issues.
   ``When he started this case he had nothing to look to for
precedent, and so other judges will at least have to turn first to
what he said,'' Ms. Andrews said. ``So it will be very widely read.
It will be very influential.''
   In a 57-page decision, Young plotted out his conclusion that life
begins at conception, relying on the testimony of a French
geneticist and a federal appeals court decision in Florida affirming
the use of DNA fingerprinting in court.
   The judge ruled that seven embryos conceived by the Davises
outside the womb through in vitro fertilization were people, not
property, and he awarded temporary custody to Mrs. Davis to bring
them to term.
   Junior Davis, who had fought to be part of any decision on the
disposition of the embryos and not to be forced to become a father
against his consent, said he would appeal to the Tennessee Court of
Appeals and potentially beyond.
   Young said after issuing the decision that he would welcome
review by a higher court.
   Typically, it takes cases two to three years to travel the
appellate route through the Tennessee appeals court and then the
state Supreme Court, and even longer if the case continues to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   Janet Mayfield, the attorney handling Davis' appeal, said a state
Supreme Court ruling could come sooner if the courts agree to
expedite the proceedings for medical reasons.
   Davis' attorneys said they will seek a stay of Young's order
preventing Mrs. Davis from implanting the embryos until the appeals
are over. There has been some question about how long the seven
frozen embryos would remain viable.
   However, Dr. I. Ray King, who oversees the Knoxville clinic where
the embryos are stored, said, ``From our standpoint, there would not
be a time restraint that we know of. In other species we can go five
to 10 years easily. I would expect in humans, it is probably going
to be similar to that.''
   There is also a question of whether the Tennessee appellate
courts will address directly the question of when life begins.
``Usually judges want to decide something on its narrowest grounds
and not open up a Pandora's box,'' Mayfield said.
   She said Davis' appeal would focus on the apparent conflict
between Young's decision awarding custody to Mrs. Davis with state
law requiring both parents to consent to donating the organs of
their children and a state policy requiring the reporting of deaths
and miscarriages that doesn't mention embryos.
   Even without appellate review, Ms. Andrews of the Bar Foundation
suggested the decision, though at this point applying strictly to
Young's jurisdiction, could prompt an array of legal cases elsewhere
on the grounds that embryos are persons.
   Some possibilities: Inheritance disputes, doctors unwilling to
perform in vitro procedures for fear of being accused of murder if
all of the implanted embryos fail to come to term _ the success rate
typically is one in five _ and even tax disputes on whether frozen
embryos can be counted as dependents on tax returns.
   If the ruling withstands appellate review, the dimensions could
be even larger, further limiting in vitro fertilization practices
and potentially entering the area of abortion rights.
   The U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision giving women
the right to an abortion did not address the issue of when life
begins and failed to find constitutional grounds for considering a
fetus a person.
   ``But the philosophy that would say that life begins at
conception would also say it's appropriate for the state to
intervene in the woman's decision about what to do with that
pregnancy as early as day one,'' Ms. Bartholet of Harvard said.
   ``And the same court that came down with this decision would
presumably say in the context of abortion that it is OK for the
state to prohibit abortion from day one. And Roe vs. Wade clearly
says the opposite of that,'' she said.
   Young said his decision was not concerned with abortion law, but
as Ms. Andrews put it, ``This case has created more potential legal
problems than it has solved.''

   Hurricane Hugo killed 10 people in
Montserrat and turned this peaceful, hilly island into a junkyard of
smashed houses and snapped trees. Residents were repairing their
homes Friday with relief supplies that have been arriving all week.
   Heavily damaged buildings included the hospital, two hotels and
the American University of the Caribbean, a medical school.
   ``It's disastrous. It will never be the same,'' said Nancy Flynn,
a nurse who was studying at the university.
   Montserrat was one of the islands hardest hit when Hugo ripped
through the Caribbean on Sunday, and the appointed governor of the
British colony said he had feared a death toll perhaps 10 times as
high.
   ``It's miraculous the casualties were so low,'' remarked Gov.
Christopher Turner, who said he survived four hurricanes in previous
assignments. ``This one was so bad I thought 50 to 100 deaths would
be more reasonable.''
   Many victims were elderly, unable to escape their collapsing
homes, he said.
   Ms. Flynn said that despite severe damage to the hospital, about
40 people were treated there for cuts, broken legs and other
injuries.
   ``People were lying in the beds with water dripping on them,''
she said. ``There was no hospital left.''
   Doctors had to suture cuts without anesthetic and beds lacked
sheets, she said.
   Turner estimated damage at about $100 million. He said 30 percent
of the homes will have to be rebuilt and another 30 percent will
need extensive repairs.
   The governor said that about 3,000 of the island's 12,500
residents were left homeless and about 1,200 remained in shelters
Friday.
   The 39-square-mile island lacked power, but some water and phone
service was being restored, he said, adding, ``The entire island
will need rewiring.'' Ships cannot dock here. The storm wiped out
the wharf in downtown Plymouth. Supplies were being flown in by
British and Canadian C-130 military planes that landed on a
3,500-foot runway rated for 40,000 pounds. A loaded C-130 carries
100,000 pounds.
   The British warship HMS Alacrity, which had been in the area for
a port call, flew a helicopter to the island Monday, Turner said.
The ship and a ham radio operator called for help, he reported.
   The airport re-opened Monday afternoon. By Tuesday, food,
building supplies and emergency generators were arriving from
Caribbean neighbors, the United States, Canada and Britain. Roads
and bridges between Blackburne Airport and Plymouth remained intact.
   Mona Ponde swept up the two remaining rooms of her frame house,
which was surrounded by piles of debris from the demolished homes of
neighbors.
   During the hurricane, she and her six children and grandchildren
huddled in the house until the two bedrooms broke away. They stayed
in a neighbor's house until the roof flew off. The rest of the storm
they rode out in the police station.
   ``It was terrible,'' said Ms. Ponde, who survived Hurricane David
on neighboring Dominica island 10 years ago. ``This one, like it,
didn't want to stop at all.''
   At the medical school, the 200 students hid under mattresses in
the dormitory as the hurricane ripped away the school's buildings.
   ``We watched and said `Oh, my God' for hours,'' Ms. Flynn said.
   The Rev. Jeff Hamblin, an Episcopal priest who attended the
school, said he crouched against a stone and concrete wall in his
dormitory.
   ``You could feel it move like you were in a car on a bumpy
ride,'' he said.
   Nearly all the trees were broken or uprooted. One water tank blew
off its platform and tumbled down a hillside.
   Turner said there was some damage at Air Studio, where Paul
McCartney, Elton John and other rock artists have recorded albums.
   The governor said he heard that studio owner George Martin would
like to have all the artists who recorded there put together an
album to benefit island residents.
   Some residents went into damaged supermarkets to salvage food
shortly after the storm, but residents said no widespread looting
occurred. Merchandise remained on some store shelves Friday.
   Police reported seven arrests for petty theft on Thursday.
   The island went through little of the chaos experienced in St.
Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where residents ransacked stores
and prisoners reportedly were released from the damaged jail to roam
the streets. President Bush ordered 1,200 troops, mostly military
police, to St. Croix Wednesday.
   ``My prisoners are out of prison, too, but they're rebuilding the
hospital,'' Turner said.
   A relief headquarters _ called by the British ``a major incident
center'' _was operating downtown.
   The sounds of hammering were heard throughout the island on
Friday as residents fixed roofs and started rebuilding homes.
   ``Montserratians are the salt of the earth,'' Turner said. ``It's
a community which has got it together.''

   The condition of Jose Napoleon
Duarte, who was in a coma and nearly died this week, improved so
much Friday that his doctor said the former president appeared to be
out of imminent danger.
   ``It is incredible. I can't explain it,'' declared Dr. Jose Luis
Saca, saying Duarte's improvement was ``like night and day. ... From
a moribund state, an agonizing state, he has progressed to a stable
state.''
   A devout Roman Catholic, Duarte received last rites early
Thursday. That night, Saca said ``only a miracle'' would prevent
Duarte's imminent death. Saca made his statements outside Duarte's
home in San Salvador.
   Duarte, 63, has incurable liver cancer that was diagnosed 15
months ago and treated with chemotherapy.
   Duarte, who worked in his earlier years as an engineer, was
president from 1984 until last June. In that post, he was a staunch
U.S. ally.
   He handed over power to Alfredo Cristiani, whose rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance trounced Duarte's Christian
Democrats in a March election. This week's crisis began Monday,
while the ex-president was visiting Guatemala. Saca said Duarte was
near death Tuesday and Wednesday from asphyxiation due to difficulty
breathing.
   Saca cautioned Friday that Duarte's condition ``is still
serious.'' He said it was impossible to say how much longer Duarte
has to live.
   When the cancer was diagnosed in June 1988, Duarte's doctors gave
him between six and 18 months to live.
   Saca and the medical team attending Duarte at his home took chest
X-rays on Friday. The physician said they diagnosed a spot of
pneumonia in the right lung.
   ``The crisis was the result of that infection,'' said Saca. He
said antibiotics had countered the infection.

   Marilyn Quayle didn't follow the
instructions left in a memo by the White House staff to bring her
sturdiest jogging shoes to Friday's outing on a volcanic island
south of Tokyo.
   She opted instead for more fasionable blue leather flats, but
that didn't stop her from leading the charge up a steep pile of lava
rock.
   With a trail of Japanese scientists, U.S. Secret Service agents,
White House staff members and reporters running to catch up, Mrs.
Quayle hiked up a caldera on Mt. Mihara, the island's active volcano
that last erupted in 1987.
   Nancy Reagan had drugs as her special concern, Barbara Bush has
illiteracy and Marilyn Quayle has disasters.
   Friday's outing was the main event in Mrs. Quayle's natural
disaster activities on a 5-day trip to Japan with Vice President Dan
Quayle.
   While Quayle attended a meeting in Tokyo of the conservative
International Democratic Union, Mrs. Quayle toured this tiny island
of farmers and fishermen to focus attention on what she called a
lifelong interest in natural disaster prevention.
   ``Being born and raised in Indiana, one can't help but be aware
of the havoc nature, especially tornadoes, can wreak and the human
disasters that are caused,'' Mrs. Quayle said.
   ``I'm pleased now that I have the opportunity to work to see that
all nations are prepared to meet natural disasters.''
   Guided by seven of Japan's leading experts on volcanos, the vice
president's wife visited the lookout station of the volcano's main
crater, the Oshima Seismic Monitoring Center, and at another crater
she forged ahead where even the experts dared not tread.
   As Mrs. Quayle stepped over a rope and ventured out to get closer
to the edge, Kunio Ando, of the Oshima Weather Station, hung back
and marveled, ``She's very brave.''
   Mrs. Quayle kept going.
   ``She must come back,'' said Taiji Yoshida, director of the Tokyo
Meterological Observatory. ``It's dangerous.''
   She walked on.
   Minutes later, she returned bringing sighs of relief from staff
members.
   In November 1986, 11,000 people were evacuated from Oshima, about
70 miles south of Tokyo, after hundreds of earthquakes rocked the
island and Mt. Mihara erupted, sending a stream of molten lava into
the air.
   Residents of Oshima, located in an area considered one of the
most volcanically active in the world, stayed off the island for a
month.
   There are 77 active volcanoes in Japan. Since 1965, three people
have died in Japanese volcanic eruptions.

   The General Assembly will hold a special
session on the international battle against drug trafficking next
month, the president of the Security Council said Friday.
   President Bush is expected to urge international action to fight
the illegal drug trade when he addresses the General Assembly Monday
   The drug problem has become so widespread it has even affected
U.N. headquarters.
   U.N. security guards were ordered this summer to clean up a
playground at the northern end of the U.N. complex where cocaine
vials were found virtually every morning.
   Brazilian Ambassador Paulo Nogueira-Batista, the current Security
Council president, said after a council meeting that the the General
Assembly will take up the issue of drug trafficking.
   ``It's clear now among all the members of the council, and it is
also the view outside the council, that the General Assembly must
deal with the question as a matter of great priority,'' he said.
   He was asked when the assembly would consider the issue and
replied ``sometime in October.''
   The Security Council is considering an anti-drug resolution.
   Britain wants drug-trafficking defined as a threat to
international peace and security, which would enable the Security
Council to direct U.N. members to act against drug dealers.
   Nogueira-Batista predicted a resolution will be adopted next week.
   The United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China are
the permanent members of the council and the other members are
Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, Malaysia,
Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia.

   The Senate on Friday confirmed Otto G.
Obermaier, a Manhattan lawyer specializing in white-collar cases, to
be to be U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.
   Obermaier, 53, succeeds Rudolph Giuliani, the New York City
Republican mayoral candidate, who stepped down Jan. 31 to enter
politics. Benito Romano has been serving during the interim.
   The confirmation came on a voice vote.
   Obermaier could not immediately be reached for comment Friday. He
was not in his office, according to his assistant.
   Obermaier, of Syosset, N.Y., is a founding partner in the law
firm Obermaier, Morvillo and Abramowitz. He was nominated by
President Bush on Sept. 6 after being recommended for the job in
January by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   D'Amato broke with his longtime ally Giuliani over the
recommendation when the senator refused to give Giuliani more say in
who would succeed him. Giuliani opposed Obermaier outright because
several of his firm's clients are targets of federal insider-trading
investigations.
   But earlier this month, Giuliani said he believed Obermaier is
``qualified for the position.''

   A meeting of Communist Party ideologists of the
Warsaw Pact nations ended Friday with agreement that each member is
responsible to pursue ``its own political line,'' East Germany
reported.
   The two-day meeting was held amid major differences between such
reform-minded pact members as Hungary and Poland and hard-liners
including East Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   East Germany's official ADN news agency reported the meeting had
ended. Its account made no direct mention of the differences _
including East Germany's angry condemnation of Hungary's decision to
allow East Germans to cross freely from Hungary into Austria and the
West.
   ADN said all the conference participants agreed that ``every
party works out and realizes independently its own political line,
its strategy and tactics. They are responsible to their own people.''
   It said the ideologists ``emphasized ... that such questions as
economic growth, development of political systems ... the raising of
living standards and guarantees of human rights and freedoms'' are
being raised in discussions of the ``perfection, remodeling or
renewal of socialism.''
   Attending the conference, in addition to Warsaw Pact members East
Germany, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, the Soviet Union and
Czechoslovakia, were representatives from Vietnam, North Korea,
Cuba, Laos and Mongolia, according to ADN.
   Jan Fojtik, chief ideologist of Czechoslovakia's Communist Party,
was quoted by the Czechoslovak news agency CTK as saying the meeting
had shown that different approaches are ``no obstacle to mutual
understanding and to the development of cooperation.''
   CTK reported Fojtik said it was necessary to achieve mutual
understanding while respecting ``the specific conditions of
development'' in the member countries.
   Czechoslovakia sided with East Germany in denouncing Hungary for
opening its borders to thousands of East Germans seeking to emigrate
to the West.

<TEXT>
   The nation's first murder conviction based on the
use of so-called DNA fingerprinting evidence was upheld Friday by
the state Supreme Court.
   In a pair of unanimous rulings, the court concluded that DNA
tests which linked Timothy Wilson Spencer to the rape-slayings of
two women were scientifically reliable.
   DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is the basic genetic material in
human cells. Scientists believe that everyone, except for identical
twins, has a unique DNA pattern.
   Spencer, 26, a former resident of a Richmond halfway house, was
convicted of murder and sentenced to death in separate trials last
year for the slayings of Susan M. Tucker, 44, of Arlington and
Debbie Dudley Davis, 35, of Richmond.
   The women were bound and strangled by an assailant who broke into
their homes through a window. At both trials, evidence was offered
that semen samples from the crime scenes and blood samples from
Spencer had matching DNA patterns.
   In DNA analysis, microscopic fragments of thread-like genetic
material are treated so that they arrange themselves into
characteristic patterns which look much like the bar codes used by
supermarket scanners.
   If pattern samples from crime scene match the suspect's, the
blood or semen is considered to have come from the suspect, since
the likelihood of matching patterns from different people is
reckoned at 1 in many millions.
   The state Supreme Court said Spencer's challenge to the DNA
evidence amounted to saying ``that we should hold off until another
day'' any decision on the reliability of such tests.
   But a number of expert witnesses testified that the technique is
generally accepted in the scientific community.
   ``Indeed, Spencer acknowledges that the evidence establishes that
the DNA tests are accepted `as reliable within the scientific
community' and that he `was unable to find or produce one qualified
expert to debunk either the theory of DNA printing or the statistics
generated therefrom,''' the court said.
   Earlier this year, Spencer was convicted and sentenced to death
in two other cases, the rapes and murders of Dr. Susan Elizabeth
Hellams, 32, of Richmond, and Diane Cho, 15, of Chesterfield County.
   Both those cases are still on appeal.

   More than 100 members of the House on Friday
asked a conference committee to reject a Senate provision limiting
the power of federal courts to protect the northern spotted owl from
the timber industry of the Pacific Northwest.
   Some critics of the provision said they would mount a floor fight
if they had to.
   Lawmakers from the area, meanwhile, stepped up efforts to reach a
compromise that would be acceptable to environmentalists, the timber
industry and their colleagues.
   The conference committee of members from the House and Senate
next week will try to work out differences between the two versions
of the Interior Department appropriations bill, to which the Senate
provision is attached.
   The critics signed a letter delivered Friday to Rep. Sidney
Yates, D-Ill., the House chairman of the conference committee urging
that the conference drop a Senate-approved amendment that would bar
federal courts during the next year from enjoining any timber sales
in federal forests known to contain the northern spotted owl.
   The owl lives only in old-growth forests of the Northwest. The
Fish and Wildlife Service is considering whether to declare it a
threatened species, which would require federal agencies to protect
its habitat.
   ``What is proposed by the Senate is unprecedented and unwise,''
Minnesota Democratic Rep. Bruce Vento, one of the signers of the
letter, said at a news conference.
   When asked whether he would be willing to lead a floor fight if
changes weren't made, Vento said ``absolutely. This is not just a
policy question for the Northwest. We are willing to look at some
form of relief (for the timber industry), but this is not the path.''

   Local officials
complained Friday that the Virgin Islands remained without any major
U.S. relief five days after the devastation caused by Hurricane
Hugo, even though federal forces were sent to control civil disorder.
   ``I think the governor was wrong in telling the people the
military was coming without telling them (when) food was coming,
water was coming,'' said Territorial Sen. Lilliana Belardo de O'Neal.
   Lt. Gov. Derek Hodge, the No. 2 official in this popular resort,
announced Friday that Hugo left homeless about 90 percent of St.
Croix's population, or more than 45,000 people. St. Croix, about 70
miles east of Puerto Rico, is the main island in the group that
includes St. Thomas and St. John.
   Hodge said damage was tentatively estimated at $4 billion.
   He also said the storm killed at least four people in the U.S.
Virgin Islands and injured 700 others. A Red Cross official however
put the deaths at six.
   Hugo slammed into the islands Sunday during its sweep of the
northeastern Caribbean, knocking out water supplies, electricity and
communications.
   ``The island is almost a total disaster,'' said Hodge in a radio
broadcast.
   He appealed for the National Guard, the police and other public
employees to return to work in full force despite the continued
chaos on the island. He said the National Guard was operating at
40-percent strength and the police at 80 percent.
   Belardo de O'Neal said she and four other senators had met with
Gov. Alexander Farrelly on Friday to find out when people can expect
relief supplies.
   The St. Croix Red Cross vice chairman, Evelyn Crittenden,
complained that the army failed to promptly fly in food, clothes,
bedding and medicine.
   ``Here we are, and this is what I have,'' she said, pointing to
some old clothes piled on a table and the floor of an office.
   She said the military police from the mainland, who were guarding
buildings with M-16 rifles and patrolling in four-wheel drive
vehicles, were intimidating people.
   ``People are scared to come out,'' she said. ``This is crazy. We
don't live like this. We're Americans. We're not people from the
Third World.''
   Former territorial Sen. Alicia Torres James said the Bush
administration should have sent relief supplies right away instead
of soldiers.
   ``Yes, there was some looting, but these were hungry people who
need food for their kids,'' she said.
   Hodge said federal disaster specialists arrived on St. Croix on
Tuesday but were unable to request immediate help because of
communications problems.
   In Washington, officials announced that a group of congressmen
and administration representatives will fly to the Caribbean on
Saturday to assess damage on Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   The congressmen, led by Rep. George Miller, D.-Calif., were to
consider any special aid requests from local officials.
   On Wednesday, President Bush declared the Virgin Islands a
disaster area and ordered in the mainland forces.
   Hodge said the Virgin Islands needs ``everything from wrenches to
chain saws to medical supplies.''
   St. Croix was placed under a dusk-to-dawn curfew after a looting
rampage that cleared shelves in everything from supermarkets to
jewelry stores.
   The National Guard has acknowledged that some of its members took
part in the looting, and several witnesses said some police also
were involved.
   On Friday, virtually every store in Christiansted, the capital of
St. Croix, appeared to have been cleaned out. There were no more
reports of looting.
   Coast Guard and U.S. Navy vessels, which had helped evacuate
people panicked by the looting Thursday, remained offshore Friday.
Some people were leaving, however, by commerical flights at the
re-opened St. Croix Airport.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Allows Parody Because of Free Expression</HEAD>

   A federal judge erred in barring distribution of
Spy magazine's parody of Cliff's Notes because the public's right to
free expression outweighs any possible confusion among consumers, an
appeals court said Friday.
   In a 17-page ruling, three judges of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals explained their Sept. 5 decision to lift the lower
court's injunction.
   Spy Notes, published by Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group
Inc., uses the format of Cliff's Notes, the long-established study
guide to the classics, to poke fun at what Spy Co-Editor Kurt
Andersen called the ``hip urban novel.''
   ``The district court's ruling unjustifiably imposes the drastic
remedy of a prepublication injunction upon the cover of a literary
parody,'' the judges wrote.
   Cliff's Notes Inc. sued the Doubleday group because it claimed
the parody looked too much like the real thing and would confuse
consumers.
   U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram granted Cliff's Notes a
preliminary injunction on Aug. 2 and Doubleday immediately appealed.
The appeals court lifted the ban on Sept. 5 and said a full opinion
would follow.
   ``We conclude that the parody cover of Spy Notes, although it
surely conjures up the original and goes to great lengths to use
some of the identical colors and aspects of the cover design of
Cliff's Notes, raises only a slight risk of consumer confusion that
is outweighed by the public interest in free expression,'' the
judges said.
   They noted that the cover of Spy Notes prominently states ``a
satire'' five times in bright red letters on the front and four
times on the back. The judges also said that a substantial portion
of Spy Notes' potential audience, college students or
college-educated adults, overlaps with Cliff's Notes' audience.
   ``As a result, the name `Spy' in the title, the notation, `A Spy
Book' emblazoned on the cover of Spy Notes and the use of a prepack
marketing device prominently displaying the `Spy' name should alert
the buyer that Spy Notes is a parody of some sorts, or at least,
that it is not the same product as Cliff's Notes,'' the judges said.
   When the injunction was lifted, Doubleday spokeswoman Jacqueline
Deval said Spy Notes was expected to be on sale at bookstores around
the country by the week of Sept. 18.
   Spy Notes gives humorous plot summaries, commentary and questions
for review on contemporary novels like ``Bright Lights, Big City''
by Jay McInerney and ``Slaves of New York'' by Tama Janowitz.
   It also includes the Novel-O-Matic, a slide rule-like device that
Andersen says allows readers to create their own 1980s novel.

   The mansions of Charleston, which
survived the Civil War, withstood the onslaught of Hurricane Hugo's
135 mph-winds on Friday, but the rest of the city bore fresh scars
from the region's worst storm in 30 years.
   The city where the first shots of the War Between the States were
fired in 1861 looked much like a battlefield Friday, with
rifle-toting National Guards troops men posted to prevent looting in
stores and buildings gutted by the wind and a tidal surge of 12 to
17 feet.
   ``It looked like just devastation all over the city,'' said
resident Milton Demetre. One of the chimneys and half the roof were
gone from his 200-year-old house.
   The streets were littered with bricks, awnings, broken glass and
other debris. The storm, packing 135 mph winds, toppled chimneys,
tore up roofs, shattered windows and collapsed houses over dozens of
square blocks.
   Most of the storied antebellum mansions that line the Battery
facing Charleston Harbor appeared to have weathered the storm with
little damage. The roofs of a few homes looked beaten by the
hurricane-force winds. The biggest threat appeared to be flood
waters, which could be seen as high as the porches.
   ``You come to respect the hurricane. You can see it on the radar,
but it doesn't do anything for you. You see it's really big,'' said
resident Elizabeth Lee.
   Pointing to a house in the city's historic district, she said,
``That house has been through hurricanes, civil wars and all. You
don't understand until you've been there.
   ``There were times we didn't know we would be alive today. We all
woke up and we hugged each other,'' she said.
   Across the street, people had to side-step broken tree limbs
tangled in Spanish moss.
   At St. Michael's Episcopal Church, a piece of wood was lodged in
the side of the roof like a spear and stones from the facade of the
Charleston County Courthouse littered the ground.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. placed the damage estimate as high as
$1 billion.

   President Bush, trying to help
Republicans score a come-from-behind victory in the New Jersey
governor's race, portrayed Democrats on Friday as soft on crime,
eager to raise taxes and champions of ``the failed policies'' of the
1970s.
   In a sharply partisan speech, Bush said there was a lot at stake
in the Nov. 7 election: ``The future versus the past. Policies that
work versus policies that don't. A better future for our children,
or one of lost opportunity.''
   The race, one of two governor's contests this year, pits
Republican Rep. Jim Courter against Democrat James Florio to succeed
GOP Gov. Thomas Kean. The other gubernatorial contest is in Virginia.
   ``I am the underdog in this race,'' Courter said, acknowleging he
trails Florio in public opinion polls.
   Florio, a liberal Democrat, ran a close race against Kean in
1981. The governor is not seeking re-election.
   ``The failed policies ... of the 1970s just aren't good enough,''
Bush said. ``Not for New Jersey, not for the United States of
America. They're not good enough to tackle drugs or crime. Or to
protect the environment or do better as a nation in education.
They're not good enough for our kids.''
   Bush campaigned for Courter at a state Republican fund-raising
luncheon before flying to Maine for a weekend at his seaside
compound in Kennebunkport.
   Before settling in at his vacation home, Bush made a brief stop
at a remote tree farm in nearby Wells to underscore his call for a
reduction in capital gains taxes, which are imposed on profits from
sales of real estate, stocks and other assets.
   Farm owner Martin Morse, owner of the 700-acre spread, told Bush
that tree farmers face substantial costs before there is any income
and said that they have to face substantial risk.
   The farmer said the 1986 changes in the capital gains tax law had
cost him more than $4,000 in one year.
   Bush rode to the farm in a van that became stuck in the farm's
dusty driveway as he was leaving. He was pushed out and drove to the
golf course for a round with Brent Scowcroft, his national security
adviser.
   After nine holes, the president went fishing in the dark for 15
minutes in the ocean off his home. As far as anybody could see, he
caught nothing.
   Bush used a tree farm to advance his campaign for a capital gains
tax cut because tree farmers must pay capital gains tax on profits
from their sales.
   That's because trees are considered tangible assets rather than
merchandise.
   The administration contends that many tree farms are small,
marginal operations. Before the 1986 tax reform act, tree farmers
could pay the then-lower rate on capital gains and make ago of it,
officials contend. Now, with the higher rates, many are going
bankrupt, the administration contends.
   Bush told the GOP fund-raiser that he rejected Democrats' charges
that his plan was a tax break for the rich. ``It is a tax adjustment
that is going to create jobs in America and that is why I am going
to continue to fight for it.''
   Bush will make a three-hour excursion Saturday to speak a
luncheon of the Archdiocese of Boston Catholic Lawyers Guild.
   On Monday, he will travel to New York for his first speech as
president to the United Nations General Assembly. He will return to
Washington late that night after hosting a reception and dinner for
U.N. dignataries.
   Sponsors said the New Jersey luncheon raised $700,000 for the
GOP, Bush told the audience.
   In New Jersey, Bush told Republicans, ``This election will decide
whether New Jersey builds on what you began eight years ago or
whether it risks everything by returning to the past, whether New
Jersey has the inspired leadership it needs to win the war on drugs
and crime, or whether it reverts to failed social policies that
blame everyone but the criminal.
   ``This election will decide whether New Jersey continues to have
the kind of leadership which balances a sound economy and a sound
ecology ... or whether its leadership says `No' to higher taxes and
`Yes' to extending the prosperity of the last eight years,'' Bush
said.
   He said Republican leadership would champion the environment,
education, jobs and the war on drugs, and that New Jersey's
residents should ``oppose those liberal Democrats who cherish new
taxes like moths drawn to some kind of a candle.''
   ``The old New Jersey's attitude was: If one tax didn't work, try
another one,'' he said.

<HEAD>Brothers Convicted of Plotting to Kill Judge With Voodoo Ritual</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUPELO, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two brothers accused of plotting to kill a
judge by using a bizarre voodoo ritual pleaded guilty Friday to
conspiracy to commit murder.
   LeRoy Ivy, 33, and John Henry Ivy, 26, both of Oxford, pleaded
guilty in Lee County Circuit Court with attempting to direct the
voodo spell against the circuit's Judge Thomas Gardner.
   Under the plea, John Henry Ivy will receive a 10-year prison
sentence, with two years to run concurrent with a 40-year prison
term he is already serving for armed robbery. Gardner had sentenced
him on the armed robbery charge, and the voodoo plot allegedly was
concocted as revenge.
   LeRoy Ivy was given a five-year prison sentence with credit for
the time he already has served.
   The Ivy brothers' trial had been scheduled to start Monday in
Tupelo.
   The case against the Ivys has drawn national attention since
LeRoy Ivy was arrested last Oct. 14 and charged with his borther,
who is incarcerated at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at
Parchman.
   The indictment said the Ivys tried to get Gardner's housekeeper
to take a lock of Gardner's hair and a picture of the judge from the
home. She was then to give the items to the Ivys, who were going to
give them to a voodoo witchdoctor in Jamaica to put a death curse on
the judge.
   The brothers offered to pay the housekeeper $400 for the items to
be used in the ritual, the indictment said.
   The brothers previously admitted to believing in voodooism, but
had denied plotting to use it to kill the judge.

   Police killed a gunman and arrested two
others Saturday hours after they exchanged three hostages held
nearly a week for a getaway car and $750,000, authorities said.
   The man was killed in a shootout on the roof of a Liege apartment
building about five hours after the gunmen released unharmed a
mother and her two daughters they had held hostage in a suburban
home.
   Police said the gunmen, including at least one prison escapee,
broke into the home of a local banker to force him to open a safe at
work. The banker escaped Sunday and went to police, but the gunmen
kept the hostages, authorities said.
   The hostages were identified as Marie-Madeleine Jeuris and her
two daughters Francoise, 12, and Gaelle, 10. Their captors released
them at different times Friday evening.
   Police identified one gunman as 28-year-old Philippe Delaire, a
Frenchman who escaped from a French prison in March with two others,
Jean Lacote and Jean Lombardo. It was not clear if they were the
other two gunmen.
   Police said that after a blue Mercedes was made available to the
three Friday, they drove away toward the Dutch city of Maastricht,
18 miles to the north. Reporters saw two helicopters following the
car.
   The gunman eventually stole another car and abandoned the
Mercedes, and it was not immediately clear why they had headed back
to Liege or what they were doing on the roof of the apartment
building.
   Officials gave this account of the 7-day ordeal of the hostages:
   Delaire and the two other gunmen entered the home of Guy Jeuris,
a local bank manager, on Saturday, Sept. 16, planning to force
Jeuris to open the safe at his bank when the bank opened Monday.
   Sharpshooters took up positions around the Jeuris villa in
surburban Tilff and officials began negotiating with the gunmen.
   The two girls were freed minutes apart at about 7 p.m. and taken
away by ambulances after police delivered ransoms of $375,000 for
each child.
   Police parked the Mercedes next to the villa and the three men
drove off in it, taking Mrs. Jeuris with them. They released her on
a highway outside Liege.
   ``We kept our word,'' Liege general prosecutor Leon Giet said of
the ransom and getaway car. He said the deal was arranged Thursday.
   Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet issued a statement praising
Liege authorities for avoiding violence and expressing disgust for
the gunmen.
   Police said Delaire and three other criminals were involved in
taking a bank manager hostage in the Netherlands in 1987 and that
the four escaped, but they had no details.

<HEAD>Bookmakers Pick Japanese Author to Win Booker Prize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six novels have been nominated for the Booker
Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award, and bookmakers say
the favorite is ``The Remains of the Day'' by Japanese author Kazuo
Ishiguro.
   The award, to be announced Oct. 26, carries a $31,600 prize
funded by the Booker McConnell food company.
   Oddsmaker William Hill gave 7-to-4 odds on Ishiguro's novel about
a butler's travels through Britain's West Country and said it was
``a firm favorite'' to win.
   Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, ``was beaten as the
Booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger
this time in our view,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe.
   The other books nominated are:
   _ ``Cat's Eye,'' a story of painter Elaine Risley and her return
to her childhood home in Toronto by Canadian author Margaret Atwood,
also a previous nominee.
   _ ``The Book of Evidence,'' a prison story of kidnap and murder
convict Freddie Montgomery by John Banville, literary editor of The
Irish Times newspaper.
   _ ``Jigsaw,'' by Sybille Bedford, an autobiographical novel about
an adolescent's travels through Germany, Italy and France.
   _ ``A Disaffection,'' Scottish novelist James Kelman's story
about a school teacher, Patrick Doyle, whose professional
frustrations are fueled by a drinking problem and unrequited love
for a colleague.
   _ ``Restoration,'' British author Rose Tremain's story of Robert
Merivel, a favorite of King Charles II who married the monarch's
youngest mistress.
   ``We expect more interest in this year's Booker Prize than ever
before, partly thanks to last year's controversy over Salman
Rushdie's `Satanic Verses,''' Sharpe said.
   Rushdie was nominated for the prize last year but it was won by
Australian author Peter Carey for his love story ``Oscar and
Lucinda.''
   Rushdie, a British citizen, has been in hiding since Feb. 14 when
the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered he be
killed for allegedly blaspheming Islam in ``Satanic Verses.''
   This year's six nominees were chosen Thursday from 102 books
considered by a panel headed by David Lodge, a British literary
critic and novelist who was nominated for the prize last year for
his book, ``Nice Work.''

   Justice Minister Monica de Greiff
resigned on Friday after death threats from drug runners and said
she did so at the request of President Virgilio Barco.
   She said Barco thought ``he needed another type of person'' in
the post.
   Barco issued a decree naming Communications Minister Carlos Lemos
Simmonds, a former foreign minister, as acting justice minister.
   Lemos Simmonds had been filling in for Ms. de Greiff while she
was in the United States following threats against her, her husband
and her 3-year-old son.
   Friday night, a bomb exploded at a suburban office of El
Espectador, a newspaper that has carried on a courageous public
campaign against drug and drug traffickers. Bogota police said the
small device destroyed the front of the advertising office.
   El Espectador's main building was severely damaged on Sept. 2 by
a car bomb that contained an estimated 500 pounds of explosives.
   Bombings have occurred in Colombian cities virtually every night
for the past month, with most of the targets in Bogota, Medellin and
Cali.
   In an interview with the Radio Caracol network, Ms. de Greiff
said she wrote a letter of resignation after being asked to do so by
the president. She was Colombia's sixth justice minister in three
years.
   ``The president has every right to ask for changes when he deems
appropriate,'' she said, adding that she would have preferred to
stay on the job.
   ``I love Colombia and I think we all have to be united during
these difficult times,'' she said, referring to the current war
between the government and the nation's powerful drug traffickers.
   ``The president thinks he needs another type of person in the
ministry and he has every right to ask for my resignation,'' she
said.
   Ms. de Greiff, a 32-year-old lawyer who accepted the post July
16, criticized ``unnecessary controversy'' surrounding her
resignation. She had consistently denied reports she would quit,
vowing to continue cracking down on the drug cartels.
   ``On Tuesday, the president offered me the embassy in Portugal
but I think that after assuming this responsibility as minister, I
shouldn't leave right now. I must stay in Colombia, even as a
private citizen,'' she said.
   Ms. de Greiff said she would travel to the United States in the
next few days to be with her husband and son, who are there after
being threatened with death by the drug cartels.
   Nearly all her predecessors were threatened with death. One was
assassinated in 1984 and another, who resigned to become ambassador
to Hungary in 1987, was shot five times in the face and seriously
wounded while walking on a Budapest street.
   During a visit to Washington in August, Ms. de Greiff appealed to
the Bush administration for $19 million in additional aid to provide
security for hundreds of Colombian judges threatened with death by
drug traffickers.
   The government's war on drugs began after the assassination Aug.
18 of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a popular presidential candidate who
had called for tough measures against drug barons.
   Drug traffickers have responded with a series of assassinations,
threats and bombings. Twelve bombs exploded in Bogota on Thursday,
most at offices of Colombia's two main political parties.
   There were newspaper and broadcast reports that Barco would make
major Cabinet changes as a result of Ms. de Greiff's resignation,
and a flurry of meetings took place in the presidential palace.
   The change comes amid growing tension between the Barco
government and the United States over the denial or cancellation of
U.S. visas to 25 lawmakers and politicians, allegedly because of
links to cocaine barons.
   Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes wrote a letter Friday to
U.S. Embassy charges d'affaire Phillip McLain asking for an
explanation of the publication in the media Thursday of the names of
Colombians denied entrance to the United States.
   ``My government considers that versions of this kind, without an
adequate clarification and precise explanation, could generate a
climate of undesirable relations between our two countries,'' said
Londono's letter, which was read over Radio Caracol.
   After meeting with Londono at the Foreign Ministry, McLain told
reporters the United States does not ``make lists of people who
receive visas or don't receive visas because of social or political
activities.''
   He added: ``There is no blacklist or list of any other color.''
   The United States Embassy has said the Privacy Act forbids it
from discussing individual cases of people denied visas.
   But testimony in a New York City courtroom Tuesday indicated a
secret list of barred foreigners is kept by the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   U.S. District Judge John M. Walker ordered the INS to partially
reveal its list following a suit brought by Colombian journalist
Patricia Lara, 35, who was barred from entering the United States in
1986 to receive the Maria Moors Cabot Prize at Columbia University
in New York.
   INS officials ordered Ms. Lara to return to Colombia without
telling her why she was banned.
   Senators whose names were on the list published Thursday
denounced the United States and charged they were being persecuted
for speaking out against U.S. policy, instead of for drug
connections.
   ``This war is going to go on until we legalize drugs, not only in
Colombia but worldwide,'' said Sen. Bernardo Guerra Serra, of the
governing Liberal Party.
   Others went as far as to accuse the United States of instigating
the climate of terror in Colombia.
   ``I will show that we are surrounded by mercenaries encrusted in
the American Embassy,'' said Sen. Juan Slebi, also of the Liberal
Party. He also believes drugs should be legalized.

<HEAD>Ole Miss Panel Recommends Banning Prank Frat for Three Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Mississippi should ban a
fraternity from campus for three years for dumping two white pledges
with racial slurs painted on their naked bodies at a
predominantly-black college, a campus committee recommended Friday
evening.
   Members of Beta Theta Pi's pledge class ``kidnapped'' two
fraternity pledges in a traditional prank Monday night, but left the
two students on the campus of Rust College, about 25 miles north of
the Oxford school.
   Rust officials and Holly Springs police said the two pledges were
naked and their hands and feet were bound with duct tape. Witnesses
said the students had ``KKK'' and ``we hate niggers'' painted on
their chests.
   The committee's recommendation followed an almost five-hour
closed hearing.
   ``They found them in violation of three sections of the
Associated Student Body code. The three sections were disorderly
conduct, personal assault and hazing,'' said Jan Robertson,
coordinator of university news.
   The committee of two students, two faculty members and two staff
members made its recommendation to Ole Miss Chancellor Gerald
Turner, who will have the final say in the matter.
   The incident had drawn calls for severe punishment for the
fraternity from the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People and the Ole Miss faculty senate.
   ``The recommendation of the administrative hearing committee is
that the fraternity be dissolved for three years with no activities
whatsoever. All activities will cease immediately, except for
transitional meetings with national fraternity representives,''
Robertson said.
   ``They can serve meals in the house until Friday,'' she said.
``Those living in the fraternity house have been given 30 days from
today to find another place to live, at which time the house will be
closed and secured.
   ``And during those 30 days, there will be a representative of the
national fraternity there at all times.
   ``They further recommended that as far as the individuals
involved in the incident, that normal judicial hearings be held for
all of those with the full range of penalties to be considered from
reprimand to expulsion,'' she said.
   She said the fraternity will have 72 hours to appeal the
committe's recommendation. If they do appeal, she said the
chancellor would announce his decision on the matter at 6 p.m.
Wednesday.
   If there was no appeal, she said the chancellor's announcement
would come after the 72-hour period.
   A man answering the telephone Friday night at the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity house was asked if fraternity representatives were
available to comment. ``I don't think nobody's going to comment on
anything,'' he said. He refused to give his name and hung up.
   Robertson said school officials don't know how many fraternity
members were involved in the incident.
   ``We don't have any names,'' she said. ``I think the next step is
to determine who the individuals were involved. ... We think around
a dozen students were involved, but we don't know for certain.''
   Ishmell Edwards, dean of students at Rust, said officials at the
925-student school had decided to let Ole Miss handle the incident.

   Federal investigators found no evidence to
support a truck driver's claim that his brakes failed before the
vehicle rammed a school bus into a water-filled pit, killing 20
teen-agers, an official said Friday.
   ``From a visual inspection, we can find nothing to indicate a
failure in the braking system,'' said Lee Dickinson, a National
Transportation Safety Board member.
   Dickinson said a visual inspection was 90 percent complete and
investigators must conduct other tests.
   The 10-member NTSB team of investigators planned to interview
truck driver Ruben Perez and his assistant, who also was in the Dr
Pepper truck when it hit the bus Thursday.
   Perez told Texas Department of Public Safety troopers Thursday
that the brakes failed on the truck, causing him to go into the
intersection and hit the bus.
   The bus, carrying 86 passengers, careened into the 40-foot pit
owned by the city of Alton.
   Also Friday, the death toll from the accident rose to 20. At
least 63 people were injured when the bus tumbled into the 40-foot
pit. One student and the bus driver, Gilberto Pena, 46, remained in
critical but stable condition; another student was critical and
unconscious at Mission General Hospital.
   Fifteen-year-old Yesenia Perez of Mission suffered cardiac arrest
Friday morning, bringing the toll to 20, a hospital spokeswoman
said. Like many other students who were trapped in the overturned
and sunken bus, the girl had inhaled a great deal of water, said
Mission General spokeswoman Linda Thayer.
   Truck driver Perez, 25, was treated at Mission General and
released Friday.
   At the site of the accident, a wreath of blue and white flowers
shook in the wind Friday morning as streams of motorists drove by,
some stopping to mourn.
   ``You can only do so much,'' said firefighter Raul Garcia,
looking into the pit where the day before he helped rescue dozens of
students and recover the bodies of others trapped in the submerged
bus.
   He and a few other men had propped the 4-foot wreath of
carnations at the edge of the pit. ``On behalf of the Alton
Volunteer Fire Department,'' its banner read.
   In the small south Texas towns of Alton and Mission, many drove
with their headlights on as a sign of mourning, and flags were at
half-staff.
   More than 10,000 people filled the Tom Landry Stadium at Mission
High School on Friday night to honor the bus accident victims.
   ``The emptiness that we feel will not be replaced again,'' said
Sanjuanita Zamora, Alton mayor. ``A part of our lives has been taken
away from us.''
   Earlier Friday, about 500 people crowded into tiny San Martin de
Porres Catholic Church for the first of the funerals, that of
12-year-old Elda Patricia Cruz.
   ``It doesn't help to say why him or why her. Only God knows,''
Rev. Frank Gomez said in the service given in Spanish and English.
   Alton, which is about 15 miles from the Mexico border, is part of
the Mission school district. Classes were canceled Friday.
   ``It's very quiet here,'' said Dina Chapa, Mission High School
assistant principal. ``What we're doing right now is collecting the
(victims') personal belongings from lockers and ... giving out
information, finding out when the funerals are for the students,''
Ms. Chapa said.
   Police said Friday that 86 people were on the bus, rather than 81
as previously reported. Sgt. Israel Pacheco said several students
who escaped the bus with minor injuries walked away from the
accident and were not immediately counted.
   The bus was designed to carry 83 people, according to the
manufacturer. Texas law sets no capacity limit, but says one student
can be standing for each seat in a bus.
   Both drivers had records of traffic violations, police said.
Truck driver Perez was convicted of speeding in 1987. Bus driver
Pena was ticketed for running a red light in March 1988, but records
didn't indicate whether he was driving a school bus at the time.

   A Chinese student wept during an immigration
hearing Friday as she described her father's imprisonment during her
country's Cultural Revolution and said she ``would rather die'' than
return to her homeland.
   ``If we return it's like a death row. My life will be like my
father's and many others,'' said Hoy Yu Li, 27, who along with her
fiance Luo Jian Guang, 32, fled China through Hong Kong and is
seeking political asylum.
   The two students, who were led into court in handcuffs, sought
asylum after leading a protest in Tokyo on June 4 against the
Chinese army's bloody repression of unarmed demonstrators in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   Immigration Judge Bernard Hornbach continued the hearing until
Friday and advised an attorney for the students to seek Hoy's
release from custody through immigration officials so she could seek
medical treatment for ulcer-like symptoms.
   During two hours of dramatic testimony, Hoy described how her
father, a poet, deteriorated mentally during his incarceration and
how her brother tried twice to swim the river between China and Hong
Kong before succeeding in 1976.
   Asked whether she would be willing to return to China, Hoy grew
somber and said, ``I'd rather die.''
   Luo had been studying business and Hoy linguistics at a
university in Tokyo for more than two years before the June 4
protest in front of the Chinese embassy in Tokyo.
   After the protest, the couple received anonymous threats at their
home in Tokyo, they said. Using Argentine passports and helped by
students in Hong Kong, they fled to San Francisco on August 7 to
seek asylum.
   Their attorney, Eugene Wong, said the two students have
legitimate fears of persecution if they are returned to China.
   He also said the case could be the model for other Chinese
residents in the United States who have spoken out against the
current regime in Beijing. There has been only one other case in
which a Chinese came into the United States after Tiananmen to seek
asylum, Wong said.
   The U.S. government estimates there are 73,000 Chinese students
in the country. President Bush decided in June to allow students who
were in the country at the time of the Beijing crackdown to remain
here.
   ``We ... seek to prove that being a pro-democracy student
constitutes membership in a particular social group under the 1980
Refugee Act,'' Wong said. ``If we succeed, this will set a very
important precedent that may enable other pro-democracy students to
be granted asylum in the U.S.''
   A decision could come immediately after Friday's hearing, or
within the next few weeks, he said.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service attorney Beverly Phillips
said the INS had no particular position on the asylum issue, but
filed a brief containing a State Department recommendation that it
not be granted because the students hadn't proven they face
persecution if they return to China.
   Since turning themselves over to immigration authorities, Luo has
been held in a Laredo, Texas, city jail, while Hoy has been at a
detention center in San Diego.
   Luo testified that his father was jailed for nine years during
the Cultural Revolution because because of developing a plan to make
his city government ``in sort of a capitalist way.'' His mother and
a paternal brother were also jailed, he said.
   When his father died in July, Luo said he was afraid to return
for the funeral.
   ``I would never return to China,'' he said, ``They know my name,
they will imprison me.''
   Both students said their Japan visas were due to expire soon, and
they feared applying for extensions because the Japanese government
would ask the Chinese government for comment and force them to
return home.

<HEAD>Israel Calls for Regional Ban on Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel called on its Arab neighbors
Friday to open immediate talks on a regional ban on chemical weapons
and accused Libya and Syria of building up huge stockpiles.
   Eytan Bentsur, head of the Israeli delegation to an international
government-industry conference on chemical weapons in Canberra,
called for separate talks between Israel and individual Arab states
on a ban.
   But Egypt, Iraq and Iran dismissed the idea of such a ban during
interviews earlier this week. They either ruled out regional accords
entirely or argued that nuclear weapons should be included in the
talks.
   Israel is believed to possess both chemical and nuclear weapons.
   Bentsur appealed to the nations of the Middle East ``not to wait
for the completion of a (global) convention, but to work on a
unilateral or regional basis.''
   He also attacked Algeria for its refusal to allow Israel to join
the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament, which is working to draw
up a global ban.
   Referring to Libya and Syria, two hard-line Arab states, Bentsur
said, ``It is doubly important the convention be universal and
all-binding in the light of the fact that two states known to be
producing and stockpiling huge arsenals of chemical weapons who
constitute a serious threat to the neighboring states have chosen
not to participate in this conference.''
   The Canberra conference, which began Tuesday, has attracted
government and industry representatives from 67 nations. Friday was
its last day.
   It was the first time industry has been involved in talks on a
chemical weapons ban and led to an international industry agreement
to help ban the weapons.

   Investigators on Friday examined a delivery
truck to see if its brakes failed before it rammed a crowded school
bus into a water-filled pit, and the death toll from the accident
rose to 20.
   At least 63 people were injured when the bus tumbled into the

things we will be looking at is the (truck's) braking system,'' said
NTSB member Lee V. Dickinson.

   On the eve of a meeting of finance officials of
the world's seven biggest economic powers, the Bush administration
insisted Friday that efforts to stabilize the value of the dollar
have not fallen apart.
   But many private economists expressed criticism about the current
state of international economic coordination and said they were
expecting little more than vague rhetoric at the end of day-long
discussions on Saturday.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan will host the talks with their counterparts from
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   It will be the first meeting of finance ministers and central
bank presidents from the seven nations since last April. Since that
time, the so-called Group of Seven has seemingly lost its control
over international currency markets.

   This is one of a series of periodic reports
looking ahead to Western Europe in 1992, when the 12 nations of the
European Economic Community remove their trade barriers and
interlock their policies and goals.

   After years of focusing its efforts on
economic and technological progress, Japan is trying to show West
Europeans it has more to offer than Walkmans, Nikons and Hondas.
   It is doing so in ``Europalia 89 Japan,'' a three-month art
extravaganza, in hopes of enhancing its reputation within the
12-nation European Economic Community, which will take down internal
trade barriers and interlock economic policies and goals by the end
of 1992.
   The exhibition is intended to show the depth of Japanese culture
and to offset charges often leveled against Japan that it dumps
goods on the market at unfair prices and follows a course of
protectionism and economic imperialism in trade policy.
   With 1992 closing in, the Japanese decided to make their move
into a market which will have 320 million potential customers.
   ``The Japanese prime minister told me it was important to
reinforce the bonds with Europe in view of 1992, which worries
Japan,'' said Jacques Groothaert, Europalia's organizer.
   Japan is going to great lengths now to give Europeans a better
and different view of its society.
   Europalia is costing $25 million and shows priceless pieces of
Japan's cultural heritage for the first time ever overseas.
   ``It is clear they want to spread a different image,'' said Gretl
Van Ourti of the Europalia Japanese Committee.
   It all contrasts greatly with the past when ``the Japanese used
to make a bad marketing effort whenever it concerned their own
image,'' said Jean-Pierre Debever, Japan specialist at Belgium's
Foreign Trade Ministry.
   ``Now, they want to put Japan in a more positive, a softer
light.''
   In all, more than 500 events _ from blockbuster art exhibits,
plays, ballets to literature and philosophy sessions _ are expected
to attract an estimated 1.7 million people in cities across Belgium.
In addition, there will be a smattering of events in six other
European nations.
   Although Europalia is by far the most spectacular effort, Japan
has also been using other means to make itself better known.
   These range from an increase in trade missions, symposia and
corporate conventions on Japan to cocktail parties, dinners and golf
competitions, said Etsuro Yoneyama, President of the Japanese
Association in Belgium.
   ``There is widespread agreement among the Japanese here that we
have to increase such happenings,'' he said.
   At the same time, trade relations with the EEC are slowly
improving, despite a staggering $25 billion trade imbalance in
Japan's favor and the barriers Europeans face to get a stake in
Asia's richest market.
   ``There are still major (trade) problems expected and many things
still have to be solved. But we are on the right track,'' said EEC
spokesman Nico Wegter, who lauded Japan's recent initiatives to
market itself better.
   Europalia organizers faced many problems to lure Japan as the
first non-European nation to their 20-year-old festival. Since its
inception, Europalia has highlighted art from a European nation once
every two years.
   At first few Japanese companies seemed willing to sponsor the
event.
   ``They were slow to catch on but changed when they realized what
a great base it would be for 1992,'' said Debever.
   As Europalia's headquarters are in Brussels, which also is the
home base of the EEC, the festival's marketing effort gained an
extra dimension. And when Japan's Emperor Akihito formally endorsed
Europalia as a showcase for Japanese art and culture, money began to
stream in.
   Japanese corporations are financing half of Europalia's budget,
with the remainder coming from the Japanese government and European
sources.
   Despite all the good will, a cultural divide remains.
   While European companies traditionally support the arts in a
discreet manner, Japanese firms look for a maximum return on
investment.
   Toyota, for instance, has been elevated to Europalia's ``Official
Car'' and chopsticks and sushi at official receptions ``are brought
to you by La Porte of Japan,'' a Brussels restaurant.
   And, ironically, Japan, a nation keen on uniforms in the
workplace, went against European tradition to insist Europalia
hostesses wear no official outfits for fear these would cheapen the
cultural aspect of the happening.

<TEXT>
   It was as revolutionary as the storming of the
Bastille, as beautifully engineered as the Eiffel Tower. That great
French achievement _ the brassiere _ is 100 years old this year.
   As the Eiffel Tower was going up, an enterprising French lady
named Herminie Cadolle was constructing the first bra _ called
``soutien-gorge'' in France, literally ``throat support,'' a
euphemism for bosom uplift.
   While her invention has become a wardrobe fixture, her
descendants are still serving up ``couture'' bras and other lingerie
in the quietly exclusive house of Cadolle on the Rue Cambon in Paris
just off the fashionable Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore.
   ``My great-great-grandmother was very liberated,'' said Poupie
Cadolle, 43, an ebullient blonde who carries on the family's custom
lingerie trade with her mother, Alice.
   Elegant women had long suffered the constraints of bust bandeaux
or body corsets, culminating in the sculpted naughty Nineties
torso-cincher aptly called the ``waspie.''
   As a working woman _ she was widowed at a very young age _
Herminie was distressed by the currently fashionable straitjacket.
   So she came up with a frilly two-part garment _ the first
beribboned ``bra.'' It was attached to the corset by net, but freed
the abdomen, and soon became an altogether separate item.
   Suspended from its two shoulder straps, this revolutionary
contraption was colorfully called the ``bien-etre,'' or well-being.
Although rooted in the French word for arm (bras), the term
brassiere is the English usage. The French still call the garment a
soutien-gorge.
   The soutien-gorge was a boon to women who were fainting dead away
as their whaleboned corsets socked them in the sternum and literally
knocked the air out of them.
   Herminie patented her invention, but it was soon copied widely.
   Since then, the bra has had its ups and downs.
   With the boyish looks of Chanel after World War I, the bra was
reduced to little more than a band, as women strove for flat chests.
   But it surged back gloriously in the sweater-girl years after
World War II, epitomized by busty movie stars like Jane Russell and
later Jayne Mansfield, inspiring the less well-endowed to look for
an artificial uplift.
   Bra manufacturers fell all over themselves to give breasts
``sexy'' shapes that sometimes looked like cannon shells rather than
bosoms.
   In France, sex kitten Brigitte Bardot showing her perky bosom in
``And God Created Women'' did a lot for the bra. And, like many
other stars, she bought hers at Cadolle.
   But concerns for a shapely bosom were deflated to an all-time low
after 1968, when militant women's libbers symbolically burned their
bras or stopped wearing them.
   Poupie Cadolle said she was horrified by all this.
   ``It was a catastrophe to let bosoms sag that way.''
   Her bra sales sagged, too, by at least 30 percent.
   ``But they've popped up recently,'' she said, welcoming the
recent return to sexier dress that gives bras and bustiers a boost.
   Nevertheless, she is leery of couturiers.
   ``I think they hate bosoms, deep down,'' she said.
   However, some designers like Chantal Thomass and Jean-Paul
Gaultier see bras as real fashion items. Gaultier has even used
metal ``bullet-tip'' bras with old-fashioned garter belts to
titillate audiences at his showings.
   Now Poupie Cadolle plans her own ``underwear-outerwear''
collection of sweet nothings dolled up for party wear, feeling that
the time is ripe for bringing silk and lace out of the lingerie
closet.
   About half Mrs. Cadolle's clients are Americans, and she gets a
kick out of them.
   ``They're likely to yell greetings to each other between dressing
rooms,'' she said. ``Whereas French women sneak around perhaps not
wanting to show that they spend that much money.''
   A custom-made bra in her shop costs about $300.
   Americans have bigger bosoms than the French, she said, but she's
using more fabric for everyone these days, ``since the average size
has risen from about 34A to 36B, mainly due to the birth-control
pill.''
   She's very upbeat about the future of the bra, especially the new
low-cut reinforced models to emphasize curves for decollete dresses,
colorfully called ``pigeonniers'' or ``balconnets'' _ little
balconies to push chests out like pouter pigeons' chests.
   But she also sees a return to the old ``waspie'' waist-cincher,
``catching on like wildfire, especially with the Japanese who don't
have very curvy silhouettes.''

<HEAD>The Kind of Cooperative Victorian Women Could Have Used</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the J-K volume of a recent
Encyclopedia Brittanica, the writer Henry James has a six-column
entry. His sister, Alice, is given no mention at all.
   The 19th-century diarist never succeeded in establishing herself
as a talent, which seemed a literary crime to the small group of men
and women who founded a writers' collective in her name.
   Alice James Books, an independent press that emphasizes women's
work, was conceived in 1972 as a strike against not only Victorian
mores, but also against the male-dominated reading lists most
college freshmen were studying in the 1970s.
   ``At the time, the people who sat in the important chairs at the
publishing houses were men,'' said Marjorie Fletcher, a poet and
co-founder. ``It was far easier to get a book on baseball into print
than one by a woman or about women's issues.''
   The collective publishes about 2,100 copies each of two books of
poetry every summer and spring. Its authors vary in age, race and
lifestyle, but they all share in the ideals from which the
non-profit enterprise grew.
   When Alice James writers agree to join the cooperative, they
agree to nurture their colleagues as well as their own work.
   So far about 70 authors have made the two-year commitment, during
which they guide their own book into print. Three have received
Beatrice Hawley Awards, a grant named after the poet that allows
poets outside of New England to publish.
   Rosamond Rosenmeier is just wrapping up work on her first
collection, ``Lines Out,'' which appears this fall.
   ``The experience is extraordinary,'' says Rosenmeier, a writing
professor at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.
   With the help of a ``buddy,'' a veteran collective member who's
already been through the process, she has taken her book from pen
and paper to its final production stages.
   ``It's definitely my book,'' Rosenmeier said. ``I've had a hand
in everything: choosing the print, negotiating with the typesetter,
picking the cover design. We even did the paste-up.''
   That participation and the support collective members lend one
another are part of the philosophy inspired by Alice James, who
struggled in the shadow of her five brothers, including Henry and
William, a prominent psychologist.
   Henry James, the author of such works as ``Portrait of a Lady''
and ``The Ambassadors,'' was so unsettled by his sister's diaries,
which he considered an invasion of privacy, that he burned his copy,
according to biographers..
   ``She was a talented woman who never had a chance to develop,''
Fletcher said of Alice James, who died at the age of 43.
   Today, Fletcher says, it's a whole new ballgame. Women have
gained widespread acceptance, so much so that the collective has
begun casting its net wider and more actively soliciting minority
writers.
   Inclusion is the idea.
   Rosenmeier chuckles to think of the group's regular Sunday
afternoon meetings. ``We're all so different,'' she says. About a
dozen writers from all walks of life gather at one member's home,
bringing with them plenty of pasta salad, fruit, cheese and wine.
   Fletcher says it's funny to watch everyone file in when the
meeting convenes.
   ``Everybody finds a chair that somehow issues from her
personality. Some sit on the floor, the clubby people sit on the
couch. I sit on a chair,'' she says.
   The business of running and promoting Alice James is always high
on the meeting's agenda. The authors take no salary, but revenue
from limited sales through catalogs, book fairs and a few stores is
far from enough to sustain the collective's budget.
   The press relies in large part on state, federal and private
grants, which Fletcher said have dwindled steadily, particularly
under the strain of Massachusetts' current fiscal crisis.
   But Jenney Milner, a part-time office manager and the only paid
employee, said the gatherings inevitably swerve from the pragmatic
to a free-for-all.
   ``That's when they get interesting,'' she said, ``when we talk
about the philosophy of the press.''
   And, adds Fletcher, ``The vagaries of the commercial world or
damned luck can't change our commitment to empowerment, to fairness,
to our philosophy.''

<HEAD>The Nation's Top Educator Prepares for the Education Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The aggressiveness of his answer stunned the
audience.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, normally one of the most
easy-going members of President Bush's Cabinet, had just been asked
if letting parents pick their child's school would lead to
half-empty ``dumb, dumb'' schools.
   ``Well, then, why don't we just close those dumb, dumb schools,''
Cavazos told reporters gathered for a breakfast briefing. Shaking in
anger, he jabbed the air with his finger over the ``choice''
question he'd been asked.
   Such emotion is something educators hope to see more of from
Cavazos at the education summit meeting Wednesday and Thursday in
Charlottesville, Va. One reason: Cavazos, a college president before
becoming education secreatry last year, will be the only educator
sure to attend the meeting of Bush and the nation's governors.
   Does Cavazos see his role as a burden?
   ``I don't think of it as pressure,'' the 62-year-old former
professor said in an interview.
   ``There certainly have been certain amounts of pressure'' in his
role preparing for the summit, he said, adding, ``This is really the
president's summit. ... I'm just simply a supporter of the president
and trying to move ahead his program.''
   Cavazos pointed out that other educators may, indeed, attend the
summit. Each governor can bring one aide to the table and, the
secretary conjectured, many may bring the heads of their education
departments.
   The summit, Cavazos said, should ``create the kind of climate
that will permit education to be examined. The only problem all of
us have is solving that education deficit.''
   Although highly praised for his understanding of education, some
educational leaders are concerned that Cavazos' conciliatory style _
which won their support after being battered by the abrasive,
outspoken William Bennett _ may hinder Cavazos from aggressively
pushing with the president substantive educational programs and the
money needed to make them work.
   ``I see this as a beginning,'' Cavazos said of the two-day
gathering. ``People look at this as the end. We're not going to come
out of there with a lot of ideas and direction. We have a long way
to go to solve this education deficit.''
   Cavazos chuckled at the mention of money, a subject that has been
avoided like the plague by virtually all those expected to have a
role at the summit. Repeating a statement often used by
administration officials, he said, ``I don't think we need more
money for education.''
   ``The education deficit is not a fiscal deficit. I see it as a
deficiency deficit,'' he said, pointing to the $330.5 billion
expected to be spent on education by all levels of government this
year and the $353 billion projected for next year.
   ``When you look at that amount of money ..., that means that
people out there are investing a tremendous amount of money in
education and yet when you look at our performance educationally, it
is not an issue of dollars. To me it is an issue of changing the way
we are doing things now.''
   As the nation's top educator, Cavazos has been working
``extremely close'' with the White House in planning the summit,
attending ``extensive meetings'' and providing background
information and suggestions that are helping to shape the agenda.
   The secretary has been lauded by educators who credit him with
persuading Bush to hold a series of private meetings with various
groups prior to the summit.
   ``I certainly have pushed the idea because I very much wanted to
have this happen ...,'' said Cavazos. ``What we're trying to do is
bring in a broad consensus and gather ideas from that.
   ``I want to make it very clear that I'm optimistic. The very fact
that the president has called this summit is a tremendous historic
occasion.''
   Cavazos, the first Hispanic named to a Cabinet post, has been a
loyal promoter of Bush's education initiatives, quietly circulating
through Capitol Hill and around the country to spread the Bush's
rhetoric.
   Key among Cavazos' own pet projects is bilingual education. But
he has won the most praise for his student loan default regulations,
which educators say have shown the right combination of toughness
and understanding of the soaring, multibillion-dollar default
problem.
   Initially lukewarm to the idea of parental choice when it comes
to their child's school, Cavazos has since enthusiastically embaced
what has become the centerpiece of Bush's education initiative.
   Without a doubt ``choice'' will be discussed at the summit along
with five other topics that Bush and the governors hope will lead to
national goals on what children should learn.
   Cavazos has described himself as the system's first beneficiary
of ``choice'' because his father, then the foreman of the huge King
Ranch near Kingsville, Texas, managed to send his five children to
the local Anglo school and not an inferior one for Hispanics.
   Cavazos grew up on the ranch, served in the Army for two years,
attended college in Texas on the GI Bill and earned a doctorate in
physiology from Iowa State University. He taught anatomy at the
Medical College of Virginia and Tufts University Medical School,
becoming dean of the latter in 1975.
   In 1980, Cavazos moved to Lubbock to become president of Texas
Tech University and in September 1988, then-President Reagan tapped
him to succeed Bennett as education secretary. Bush, who had pledged
not only to be the education president but to put at least one
Hispanic in his Cabinet, kept Cavazos on.

   U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr.,
imprisoned on a perjury conviction since March 1988, wants the
Senate to let him go from his jail cell back to the federal bench.
   ``It could happen,'' says Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who sat
on the impeachment trial committee for former U.S. District Judge
Harry Claiborne three years ago. But even though the impeachment
proceedings are separate from Nixon's criminal trial, DeConcini says
he doubts the public would understand an acquittal in one following
conviction in the other.
   Claiborne also was in prison at the time of his impeachment, and
the lawyer who defended him is less than optimistic about Nixon's
chances. ``Poor Judge Nixon doesn't stand a chance,'' says attorney
Oscar Goodman, blaming the Senate's decision three years ago to
begin having a small group of senators conduct impeachment trials
and then report to the full chamber.
   ``Very few of the senators had any comprehension of what the
proceedings were all about,'' Goodman says.
   Nixon is the 15th person to be impeached by the House and
scheduled for trial by the Senate in the history of the United
States. For the first 197 years of Congress, that meant trial by the
full Senate.
   But when the Senate got the Claiborne case in 1986 _ the first
impeachment in 50 years _ it appointed a 12-member committee to
preside over the trial and report back to the full body.
   After the report from the committee and a secret debate among all
the members, the Senate removed Claiborne from office. Nixon's trial
before the Senate panel was completed this month and the committee
is due to report to the full Senate in October.
   Nixon's lawyer, David Stewart, has filed a lawsuit in U.S.
District Court claiming the committee method is unconstitutional.
   So have the attorneys for U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of
Florida, who also is awaiting a verdict. He was impeached by the
House and had his trial July 10-Aug. 3 before a Senate committee
chaired by Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.
   DeConcini defends the process, saying the Constitution is silent
on how the Senate is to conduct its trial. Furthermore, he says the
Constitution doesn't give the courts jurisdiction over the Senate's
internal procedures.
   During the four-day Nixon trial that ended Sept. 13, a committee
led by Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., listened with rapt attention,
though seldom with full attendance, to the proceedings. The trial
also was broadcast over the closed-circuit congressional cable
channel.
   Nixon's story is that of an exemplary federal judge, whose
21-year career seldom saw a case overturned on appeal, but whose
associations with an eccentric millionaire and a flamboyant county
prosecutor in Hattiesburg, Miss., led him into a tangle of perceived
illegality, adverse local publicity and a federal investigation that
ended with a perjury conviction.
   DeConcini, who is not on the Nixon committee, says there is a
distinction between a criminal conviction and potential removal from
office, which is what the Senate does when it convicts on
impeachment.
   ``They may sound alike and appear alike, but they truly are two
different things,'' he says. The Constitution does not say that a
public official must be removed from office following a criminal
offense.
   ``It is my judgment that we are to make that decision,''
DeConcini says.
   The key figures in the Nixon case are:
   _Drew Fairchild, estranged son of the richest man in Hattiesburg,
Miss. He was arrested on charges of smuggling a ton of marijuana
into the local airport and released by federal authorities after a
plea bargain, but didn't pay his attorney and later was indicted on
state charges.
   _Wiley Fairchild, 72 at the time, whose formal education ended
after the fourth grade, but who made a fortune on his ability to
find oil. He complained to Nixon that the local prosecutor had his
son indicted on state charges as a way to ``blackmail'' him for the
legal fees Drew owed his attorney.
   _Paul ``Bud'' Holmes, a private attorney and nightclub owner
before he became county prosecutor, who admitted he helped have Drew
indicted to help his friend, Drew's attorney, collect legal fees.
   _Carroll Ingram, attorney and second cousin to Wiley Fairchild,
who helped the elder Fairchild with his business dealings and
arranged a lucrative oil deal between Nixon and the oilman.
   _Nixon, 56, who was the youngest federal judge in the country
when he was appointed at age 39 to the bench by President Lyndon
Johnson. Both the defense and prosecution say he was stretched
financially by the burdens of raising seven children on his judge's
salary.
   _Reid Weingarten, 36, an attorney with the public integrity
division of the Justice Department who had unsuccessfully prosecuted
Judge Hastings of Florida. Nixon claims Weingarten ``wanted to get a
judge.''
   The House prosecutors say Nixon ``fixed'' the case against Drew
Fairchild because he was grateful for the oil deal he got from Wiley
and wanted more such investments.
   Nixon says a conversation he had with Holmes about the case was
merely to pass along Wiley Fairchild's claim that he was being
blackmailed, but that he never discussed the case or said anything
that influenced its outcome.
   Holmes backs up the judge on that, but gave testimony that casts
some doubt on whether Nixon's actions were an effort to ingratiate
himself with Wiley Fairchild for more investments.
   The articles of impeachment allege:
   _Nixon lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case
against Drew Fairchild with Holmes.
   _Nixon lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do
officially or unofficially with the Fairchild case and never
influenced anyone in the case.
   _Nixon undermined ``the integrity of the judiciary'' and
disobeyed the law by making 14 false or misleading statements during
an interview with federal investigators and in his sworn grand jury
testimony.

<HEAD>Speed, Now Called `Crank,' Making Resurgence in United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's cheap, it's easy to produce and drug
dealers tout the fact that it's ``made in America.''
   Methamphetamine, known in the 1960s as ``speed'' and now widely
called ``crank,'' is making a resurgence in the United States as an
inexpensive alternative to cocaine or crack.
   Users are beginning to smoke it, sending an instant jolt to the
brain. But unlike crack, crank can give the user a high that lasts
several hours.
   Quickly addictive, it can also lead its victims to hospital
emergency rooms, their fists clenched, raring for a fight even while
strapped to gurneys for their own protection and that of hospital
workers.
   ``I think there's sound reason to say this stuff is more
dangerous than cocaine or crack,'' says James N. Hall, executive
director of the Up Front Drug Information Center in Miami. ``Speed
killed in the 1960s and it can still kill in the '90s.''
   The Justice Department, in a report last month, said
``methamphetamine has the potential of becoming the crack problem of
the 1990s.''
   Dr. George M. Shumaik, an emergency room physician at the
University of California at San Diego Medical Center, describes
crank users as ``crazy'' and ``combative.''
   ``The complications are the same as we saw with PCP,'' Shumaik
says of crank users who overdose severely. ``They're so combative
and so strong that they can throw you across the room.''
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse says the number of deaths
involving crank nearly tripled in 2{ years _ from 34 in the second
half of 1985 to 91 in the first half of 1988 according to reports
from 26 metropolitan areas.
   ``There has been an explosive growth in the use of
methamphetamine'' over six years, the Justice Department says. The
problem has been especially severe in the western United States and
Southern California.
   San Diego, according to the Justice Department, is ``the
methamphetamine capital of the United States.''
   Shumaik says many of those who come to his UCSD emergency room
suffering from crank overdoses just need a place to come down from
highs that can last up to 24 hours due to repeat doses.
   Their hearts will be racing, their blood pressure will be high,
they'll be paranoid and anxious, but they'll survive.
   But severe overdoses can result in seizures, increased muscle
tension or hyperthermia.
   ``They'll be so wired up, their muscles so tight, so intensely
clenched, that the muscle protein breaks down, gets into the blood
stream, goes to the kidneys and can create kidney failure,'' Shumaik
says.
   ``They lose their temperature regulation. Our record is 109
degrees. I've not seen any of those patients survive.''
   Methamphetamine also is ``associated with a high sense of
paranoia, even greater than cocaine and definitely a greater degree
of violent behavior,'' Hall says. ``There's a psychotic reaction.
People go crazy with this drug.''
   Smoking speed gives the user ``an initial short-term jolt like
crack for 10 minutes or so, but it will have a residual long-term
effect of several hours, a stimulant effect,'' he says.
   But users ``won't be impressed'' by the lingering stimulation,
``so they are very likely, while still under the effect of the
stimulant ... to redose again and again because they're chasing the
jolt, seeking that exhilaration.''
   The result can be an overdose.
   In the first six months of 1986, 846 emergency room patients were
found to have used methamphetamines, according to NIDA statistics
from selected hospitals. In the final six months of 1988, those same
hospitals reported 1,444 methamphetamine uses.
   Most of the increase occurred in Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles,
Phoenix, San Diego and Seattle.
   Crank users, officials say, are overwhelmingly white,
lower-middle income with a high school education or less. They range
in age from 20 to 35 and generally buy the drug from friends who
also use it.
   Frank Tarallo, the chief of the Drug Enforcement Agency's
dangerous drugs investigations section, estimates clandestine
methamphetamine labs could produce 25 tons of the drug this year.
The number of labs seized rose from about 350 in 1985 to about 600
thus far in 1989.
   The drug is relatively simple and inexpensive to make, although
the highly volatile and toxic chemicals cause health and
environmental concerns.
   ``We have found people dead in these labs, overcome by fumes,''
Tarallo says. ``These clandestine labs flush these chemicals down
the toilet, down the drains, bury it in back yards,'' sometimes
contaminating groundwater.
   Chemicals and equipment run about $400 to $500 per pound of
crank, which can be sold wholesale for $8,000 to $17,000, Tarallo
said.
   Individual users pay $50 to $125 for a gram, which provides 10 to
15 doses, Tarallo said. A beginning user might take one or two doses
per day, but a heavy user who has built up a tolerance over several
years might take a full gram in a day, he said.
   By comparison, cocaine prices range from $55 to $125 a gram,
while crack cocaine sells for $20 a rock in Washington, D.C.,
according to Mario Perez of the DEA, who says smaller doses sell for
$5 to $10. A normal user who needs to stretch limited funds might
consume four rocks a day, while an extremely heavy user could take
five to six times that amount.
   Dealers, Tarallo says, tout the fact that crank is ``made in
America.'' No South American drug lords. No problems getting
supplies past Customs agents. The profits stay here.
   Hall says some of crank's popularity can be traced to the
attention given to the dangers of other drugs.
   ``We had users in San Diego who reported to us that they saw a
lot on television about the dangers and risks of crack cocaine, but
heard nothing about this drug, so they falsely assumed it was
relatively safe.''
   Users generally begin using the drug by snorting it, later taking
it orally. Some inject it. Many now smoke it.
   A form of smokeable methamphetamine, known as ice, has appeared
in Hawaii, which has had a minimal encounter with crack, and in the
San Francisco area.
   ``It's a nightmare here, and there is still only a glimmer of
understanding of its longterm effects,'' U.S. Attorney Dan Bent in
Honolulu said recently.
   Tarallo said ice's crystalline form translates into a stronger
form of smoke than the powdery, domestically produced crank. The
high, he says, can last four to 10 hours.
   But Hall said smoking methampethamine in any form will provide
the same rush.
   Speed and cocaine ``have almost seesawed through this century in
terms of popularity,'' Hall says.
   Methamphetamine and amphetamine ``replaced the early cocaine
epidemic in Europe and the United States about the time of the
closing days of World War I when cocaine's effects were becoming
rather widely perceived, among the relatively small group using it,
as addictive and a hazardous drug.''
   Amphetamines gained popularity in the early '60s, when they were
made available as pharmaceutical drugs, prescribed as appetite
suppressants. Hall says their abuse resulted in a speed epidemic in
the late 1960s and early '70s.
   In the early '70s, physicians and pharmaceutical companies
clamped down on the diversion of the licit drugs into the illicit
market, and the speed craze waned. But at the same time, cocaine
became more popular.

<TEXT>
   If you decided to tiptoe out for a night on the
credit card last Friday, rest assured you missed nothing with two
new series that bowed then, CBS' ``Snoops'' and NBC's ``Baywatch.''
   ``Snoops'' stars Tim Reid, of the late and good ``Frank's
Place,'' as a professor of criminology in Washington, D.C., and
Daphne Maxwell Reid, his wife, as his wife, a protocol honcho for
the State Department.
   ``Baywatch'' is a Southern California surf-and-sand lifeguard
tableau with a bronzed cast led by David ``Knight Rider''
Hasselhoff. He wears a lieutenant's uniform, is divorced and has a
young son whose custody he shares with the mother.
   Each show lasts an hour. But ``Snoops'' appears the lesser of two
bores.
   Its stars are amateur sleuths, much to the dismay of Reid's
police lieutenant pal, essayed by John Karlen. Their debut concerned
the solution of a 4-year-old unsolved murder case in which a
stockbroker was the departed.
   The impetus for their efforts: Questions raised in Reid's class
by a brilliant, cocky student (Jon Matthews), who on his own pursues
the case. Also present were a convicted swindler, a killer
millionaire and a beautiful ex-mistress who now owns a spa for women.
   Double-crossing and insider trading were part of the hour. But
the high point of the evening came when the ex-mistress told the
millionaire, ``I'm not going to jail for you, Arthur. I'd sooner
die.''
   Our ``Snoops'' couple often engaged in light-hearted banter. This
no doubt is intended to show the series is sort of a contemporary
``Thin Man'' expedition, a ``Nick and Nora Go to Washington.''
   The problem, as with more than a few shows emitted by Hollywood
these days, was the script. It was an epic in lackluster, and our
heroes' banter was so strained the show seemed in danger of a
two-star hernia.
   It's always possible ``Snoops'' eventually will improve. But not
``Baywatch.'' It is full of healthy, well-toned male and female
lifeguard bodies, surf scenes, and that's it.
   Other than establishing forgettable characters, the premiere
featured what may be TV's first case of a beautiful windsurfer
killed by hit-and-run jetskiers.
   When first reported, the accident caused Hasslehoff to order, ``I
want an undercover recovery team, Code Three, here as soon as
possible.'' Oh, good grammar, where is thy sting?
   In a later, unrelated scene with his son, he rued that when he
was married he didn't do more in preparing the lad for life: ``I let
your mom be the enforcer while I was out teaching you to surf.''
   Hey, kid, Just Say No to Surf.

   There seems no relief from awful new-show scripts. Another
example is Tuesday's ``Living Dolls'' preview on ABC. This sitcom,
which starts its regular run Saturday, appears a good excuse to read
a book for 30 minutes each week.
   The show stars a fine actress, Michael Learned, as the owner of a
top New York modeling agency. Formerly the Mom of ``The Waltons,''
she now plays the wise, patient den mother and agent for four
teen-age girls training to be fashion models. The girls also attend
schools, exercise class and fittings.
   These wanna-be mannequins, different in their varied ways, share
Learned's surprisingly big townhouse with her son (he is supposed to
be a teen-ager, too, but looks twentysomething). These beauties
drive him bats.
   That, like the show's efforts to give everyone a subplot and
depth of character, doesn't ring quite true. But the lame dialogue
doesn't help, either.
   And, like many TV shows by the TV generation for the TV
generation, this one feels it needs to refer to a well-known series
show to establish a frame of reference.
   The teen models attend a school that's ``flexible,'' one of them
tells a visitor. Their place of learning, she says, lets them
audition and take jobs, ``like that school on `Fame.' ''
   Well, at leastthe laugh track loves ``Living Dolls.''

   Andy Garcia doesn't like to talk about acting.
There are methods, he insists, that must be kept from the public,
intricate preparation that, if revealed, would spoil his character's
aura of spontaneity.
   On screen, he is equally mysterious, preferring to play cops who
let a slight turn of the head or an eye that gleams like an
officer's badge take the place of words.
   That's one reason why he was drawn to the character of Charlie
Vincent, the quiet, faithful sidekick of Michael Douglas'
swaggering, hard-headed detective in ``Black Rain.''
   ``If your thought is clear, there's nothing else you have to
do,'' said the Cuban-born actor, whose big breakthrough came last
year as Kevin Costner's eagle-eyed sideman in ``The Untouchables.''
   ``That's the task. Now how do you go about doing it, to convey
the beautiful thought? Once you do all the preparation, it's really
spontaneous, the character behaving. Once all the
intellectualization is done, you just do it.''
   The homework _ tracing the character's history, internalizing his
conflicts _ are for the actor's eyes only. What Garcia cares about
is how audiences feel about Charlie, who helps Nick Conklin track
down a Japanese hitman in Osaka and gets killed in the process.
   ``When people are in times of need, certain individuals come into
your life that act as a foil or help you come out of that,'' Garcia
said. ``I look at Charlie as that angel who came down and provided
that, and when his time was done, and the door opened, he goes.
   ``He's usually pretty upbeat. When you're down he keeps your
spirits up. He always seems to be easygoing and yet is usually the
most spiritual and painful character.''
   Garcia, who emigrated to Miami Beach with his parents when he was
5 years old, liked movies as a child but felt no special desire to
act until he went to Florida International University.
   ``I don't know. It was really a virus situation that just invaded
me and was brewing bigger and bigger,'' he said. ``I was in my share
of plays as a kid, but so was everyone else in the world.
   ``I do think there is a correlation between the spontaniety and
spirit of athletic competition and the moment-to-moment rush of
acting.''
   After college, he went to Los Angeles, hoping to break into
movies. First came a spot in the TV pilot for ``Hill Street Blues.''
Theater work followed, with appearances in ``Anastasia,'' ``The
Cherry Orchard,'' ``Don't Trust Life'' and other works.
   Movies began in 1985 with ``The Mean Season,'' starring Kurt
Russell.
   ``It was tough but very rewarding, and afforded me the luxury not
to have another job,'' Garcia said. ``It was a fresh learning
experience, but it's still a stage. The stage becomes a street, and
the onlookers are your audience. ``You pay dues and you have the
learning process that no one can take away from you.''
   Garcia's penchant for simplicity colors his approach to choosing
films. Rather than agonizing over image and storyline, he takes a
look at who else is involved. For ``The Untouchables,'' that meant
Sean Connery.
   ``When I heard he was in it I said, `Oh great, let's go.' He was
a hero ... when he played James Bond.
   ``I admired his work ethic, his preparation. He was ready to go.
If you weren't ready, he'd blow right by you. Eight in the morning,
ready to go. All great actors are like that. The people you're with
are the spark that opens the door to all that work.''
   ``Black Rain'' offered several temptations: Douglas, director
Ridley Scott (``Blade Runner,'' ``Alien''), and producers Stanley
Jaffe and Sherry Lansing (``The Accused,'' ``Fatal Attraction'').
   He credited Scott with allowing him to pursue his character to
the fullest.
   ``Ridley said an interesting thing to me for one scene,'' Garcia
recalled. ``He said, `I think you should go for whatever you want to
do, because you need to get all the way to the end.' It comes out
from using all your energy and within that state of exhaustion,
finding that precious moment.''
   But Garcia's tribute to the late Hal Ashby, who directed him in
``8 Million Ways to Die,'' is most in line with the actor's taste,
what he likes to accomplish on film and can't resist doing in person.
   ``I liked the fact he never said anything. He did say everything,
but without imposing anything.
   ``I'm an observer, to the detriment of many people around me,''
Garcia said. ``The great danger of being in the public eye is losing
that perspective and becoming the one being watched instead of the
one watching. But you have to cope. You have no choice.''

   Music fans no longer have to judge a record
by its cover.
   A new company is offering consumers the chance to sample portions
of albums using their touch-tone telephones. At 89 cents a minute, a
nimble-fingered fan can form musical opinions for less than the cost
of a single.
   ``With the cost of compact discs and the large market out there,
this gives a listener a chance to hear an album before he buys it,''
said Mark Munson, marketing director for Music Systems Inc.
   The Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company has been operating its special
charge 900 telephone line since the beginning of August. About 5,000
people a week are calling to hear a little music, Munson said.
   Music Line is the little brother of the party lines and rock
hotlines that have boomed in popularity during the past few years
with advancing telephone technology.
   Callers who hook into the system are asked to choose from among
more than 100 albums in categories such as rock, heavy metal, rap,
progressive and so-called black music.
   Once the selection is made, a 10- to 15-second snippet of each
song on the album is played. Callers can move on to another song or
album with the press of a button. The average caller stays on the
line for about four minutes.
   ``We sampled the 15 seconds that hopefully are the most
indicative of the song,'' Munson said. ``We don't just start at the
beginning.''
   Albums on the playlist range from such hit artists as Fine Young
Cannibals, the Traveling Wilburys and Madonna, to more obscure
newcomers such as rappers Three Times Dope and independent label
rockers Nirvana.
   A group of Harvard Business School students were the brains
behind the idea. They started a telephone line in the early 1980s,
but it folded due to high costs. A 900 telephone line is considered
easier and cheaper to run.
   With radio stations increasingly reluctant to play more than one
or two songs from an album, Music Line performs an important
service, Munson said.
   One act that's generated a lot of calls, he said, is Elektra
Records recording artists 10,000 Maniacs. Curious fans can easily
find out through Music Line that despite the name, 10,000 Maniacs is
actually a literate folk-rock band, he said.
   ``Elektra is intrigued by the idea that they are on the system,''
Munson said. ``That kind of a response is good. They see it as a
valuable service.''
   But the group's manager, Peter Leak, said he's not certain he
likes the idea of someone outside the group boiling down 10,000
Maniacs songs into the 15 seconds they consider most important.
   ``Hearing 15 seconds of each song on each album isn't hearing the
whole album,'' said Leak, whose New York End Ltd. also manages the
Cowboy Junkies, another band featured on Music Line. ``To imagine
that it does is not being realistic.''
   It's much preferable, he said, for a fan to slip on a pair of
headphones in a record store and hear as much of the album as
possible. Many record stores used to have ``listening booths'' where
customers could do this.
   Music Line has no formal relationship with record companies, but
marketing departments in several companies are eagerly providing the
phone service with compact discs and promotional materials, Munson
said.
   That's obviously in their best interests, he said, because
listeners who like the 15-second snippets will go out and buy the
records.
   Record company reaction has been more cautious.
   ``We've been approached, but we have absolutely no idea what the
potential of this thing is,'' said Robert Altshuler, spokesman for
CBS Records, whose records are being used on Music Line. ``It's too
early. This is a brand new thing.''
   The service helps record companies in the same way radio play
does, said Louis Dennis, national sales director for Warner Bros.
Records, whose LPs are also being used.
   ``Obviously the more exposure we get, the better we are,'' Dennis
said. ``Whether this is a revolutionary thing, I don't know.''
   But Dennis said when he first saw advertisements for Music Line,
he alerted Warner Bros.' legal department. Munson said that's been
the initial reaction of several record companies, whose persnickety
attitude toward unauthorized use of their product has been seen in
the controversy over home taping.
   ``I'm not saying they don't have the rights to do it,'' Leak said
of the service. ``I'm sure they do. I'd like to make sure that there
are some provisions that people get taken care of. It seems a little
unfair that all the money flows into one pocket.''
   Music Line pays a small fee to music publishing firms for use of
the songs, Munson said. The company is relying on a legal opinion
that says it owes record companies nothing, he said.
   ``If any record company feels they don't want the album on the
system, we'll take it off the system,'' he said. ``Of course, it's
in their best interests to be on the system. It's a new thing, and
of course people always have questions about new things.''
   The company also wants to assuage the fears of parents who worry
about teen-agers rolling up exorbitant phone bills. At a parent's
request, the company can block calls coming in from a particular
phone line, Munson said. The company also offers a money-back
guarantee to dissatisfied customers, although the process would take
a few months, he added.
   The phone service, which drew more than 12,500 calls in its first
month, has an eventual goal of 2,500 calls a day, Munson said.

<DATELINE>WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At Greenwood Elementary School, scores of
pupils can count on a free hot meal every day. They also can expect
regular lectures on the evils of drugs. Both come courtesy of Uncle
Sam.
   The federal government writes billions of dollars in checks each
year to educate tens of millions of children across America. As is
the case with most schools, Greenwood's share goes for everything
fom lunches to lessons.
   ``The work of the federal government in terms of how it helps
urban centers is critical,'' said Jack Taylor, superintendent of
Waukegan Community Unit School District 60. ``We just simply
couldn't handle the youngsters' needs without this type of funding.
... It makes the schools decidedly better.''
   At the start of the 1980s, nine cents out of every dollar spent
by the public schools came from Washington. Today, it is barely six
cents.
   The federal share slipped even while the Department of Education
budget grew from $14.8 billion in fiscal 1981 to almost $22 billion
for fiscal 1989.
   While the federal share dwindled, state and local expenditures
have spurted, and overall education spending has jumped 29 percent
in real dollars _ after inflation _ since 1981. Expenditures per
pupil in the public schools have risen from $2,762 in 1980-81 to an
estimated $5,246 in the current school year.
   President Bush told lawmakers in Helena, Mont., last week: ``The
plain truth is that our educational system is not making the grade.
... Spending more money on education than most other countries,
we're getting less return on the investment. It is time for change,
perhaps radical change.''
   Just what kind of change will be discussed Wednesday and Thursday
in talks between Bush and the nation's governors.
   Although Washington will provide a seemingly substantial $11.6
billion for elementary and secondary education in 1989, including
the Agriculture Department's free lunch and breakfast plan, the
federal government often is the smallest _ and most limited _
partner in the school financing formula.
   It accounts nationally for about 6 percent of elementary and
secondary school spending; poor areas generally get more because of
programs designed for the needy.
   In Illinois, for example, the state in recent years has provided
five to six times as many education dollars as the federal
government.
   The ratio is about the same in District 60, which has 11,500
students in 21 schools in this blue-collar lakefront community about
10 miles from the Wisconsin border. The enrollment is equally
divided among blacks, whites and Hispanics.
   In the 1987-88 school year, the district spent an average $4,102
per pupil. The national average that year was $3,522.
   The district's projected budget for 1989-90 is $40.3 million.
More than 92 percent will come from local and state sources, while
federal aid will make up only 7.29 percent _ about $2.9 million.
   It seems a small contribution, but it's an essential one.
   ``When you're talking to a district in the red, every dollar is
very valuable,'' said Lawrence Pekoe, associate superintendent for
administration. ``It's not a matter of getting it from the state
government or the local taxpayer. We just don't have the property to
tax.''
   But Pekoe also noted educators have few options with Washington
dollars because, unlike general state funds, they are specifically
targeted. Two of the largest federal programs are for poor and
special education students.
   This strings-attached approach ``is good on one hand because it
earmarks money for special needs,'' Pekoe said. ``You put energy
into that area you might not if you didn't have the money. (But) it
also prevents a district from using that money in other ways that
might be of greater need.''
   In District 60, free and reduced-price breakfasts and lunches
last year consumed more than a third of the available federal
dollars.
   The two other biggest chunks of aid went to special education and
Chapter I, a remedial program for low-income students that is used
in Waukegan to boost reading skills. About 85 percent of the money
goes for salaries and benefits.
   Federal funds for District 60, usually channeled through the
state, also pay for vocational education; high school ROTC; staff
training in math and science; Follow Through, an extension of Head
Start; library equipment; aid to Hispanic students; and a drug and
alcohol education program coordinated with the county and featuring
local police lectures.
   Local school officials rely on these programs.
   Consider Judith Lafferty, principal at Greenwood, where more than
a third of the 328 pupils are from poor families.
   ``Initially I was never really enamored with the free lunch
program or the breakfast program,'' she said. ``It can be an
administrative headache.''
   But for some children, ``these are only the two times during the
day they know they can get something to eat,'' she added. ``You
can't teach a kid who's not properly nourished. You can wish a
situation away and try to blame it on their parents. That's not
going to change the fact some of these kids are sent to school with
nothing to eat.''
   At Greenwood, 183 children receive free or reduced-price lunches
at a federal price tag of more than $44,000 each school year. Each
free lunch costs about $1.40, Pekoe said.
   As for the 48 students who benefit from Chapter I reading money,
Mrs. Lafferty said: ``It gives them an opportunity for small group
instruction and for individual attention, which some of these kids
lack at home. They don't have someone read to them; they haven't
been exposed to books. It helps to build these kids' confidence. In
some cases, I've seen them improve by leaps and bounds.''
   The projected cost for the 1989-90 school year: about $76,700, or
nearly $1,600 a child.
   Like so many other educators, Mrs. Lafferty would appreciate more
federal aid.
   ``But what they do, I'm glad I've got that,'' she said. ``It does
make a difference _ really.''

<HEAD>Ingmar Bergman Writes Revealing Play About His Parents</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a child, Ingmar Bergman's parents
locked him in a dark closet when he disobeyed. To amuse himself, he
beamed a flashlight with a colored light onto the wall and pretended
he was at the movies.
   Now 71, the famed director has written a screenplay about his
father, Erik Bergman, an insecure and depression-prone pastor, and
his mother, Karin, a woman of iron self-discipline who cringed at
any show of love.
   In ``Good Intentions,'' Bergman casts back his memory and his
imagination to the first 10 years of his parent's turbulent
relationship and marriage.
   The play is a six-hour chronicle in four acts, to be shown as a
four-part television series and a two-part movie. Production begins
late next year, and the scheduled premiere will be on Swedish
television Channel One in 1992.
   ``I feel a great need to tell the story of these two people who
are in my blood, my nerves and my genes,'' Bergman said.
   Bergman gave up film direction after his 1982 ``Fanny and
Alexander,'' which won four Academy Awards. Since then, he has been
busy producing stage plays at the Royal Dramatic Theater in
Stockholm, which once rejected him for a job when he was an aspiring
21-year-old production assistant.
   For ``Good Intentions,'' Bergman vacated the director's chair to
Danish filmmaker Bille August, whose ``Pelle the Conqueror'' won the
1989 Academy Award for best foreign film. Bergman said that after he
saw ``Pelle'' six times, the choice of the 40-year-old Dane was
obvious.
   August called the screenplay ``one of the best love stories I
have ever read. It is a great drama and an honor to take part in
delivering.''
   As evidenced in his confession-like autobiography, ``The Magic
Lantern,'' Bergman has been grappling with confusion for many years
over his feelings for his parents.
   They have appeared on screen before, in some of the best of
Bergman's 50 films. In ``Fanny and Alexander,'' a soft-spoken
clergymen slowly exposes himself as consumed with fanaticism and
hatred.
   The 1973 film ``Cries and Whispers'' is about three sisters and a
servant girl. Bergman has said they represent four aspects of his
mother, whom he was seeking to understand through his characters.
   He nurtured the idea for ``Good Intentions'' ever since
completing ``Fanny and Alexander.'' In his memoirs, he wrote about
his parents from his childhood perspective, which was often brutal
and angry.
   It left him unsatisfied. ``I started writing about all the dreams
and memories of my parents. Finally, I had a script,'' he said. It
took him five months last year to write it.
   The new film promises a sympathetic look at a young couple, a
theology student and a somewhat spoiled young woman from an affluent
home. The characters have fictional names, which allows Bergman to
play with facts.
   The movie covers the time of the couple's meeting in 1909 to the
year of Bergman's birth in 1918.
   In his memoirs, Bergman wrote about his failure to reach his
parents and his own attempts to hide despair by burying any display
of feeling. His emotions, he said, ``inhabited a closed room and
were produced on command, but never rashly.''
   He was raised according to ``the concepts of sin, confession,
punishment, forgiveness and grace _ concrete factors in
relationships between children, parents and God.''
   He described his father, a Lutheran minister, as ``nervous,
irritable and depressive. ... He was always fretting and given to
violent outbursts of temper.''
   His mother ``was always tense, slept badly and used strong
remedies which had side effects causing restlessness and anxiety.
Like Father, she was haunted by a sense of inadequacy.''
   The book barely touches on his parent's feelings for each other,
but a stormy picture emerges when it does.
   As a child, he recalled seeing them in a fierce argument and
scuffle. ``We didn't know that Mother had gone through a passionate
love affair or that Father suffered from severe depression. Mother
was preparing to break out of her marriage, Father threatening to
take his own life.''
   Divorce in those days was almost unthinkable, especially for a
respected pastor, and the church stepped in to reconcile the couple.
   Yet the reconciliation was mostly for show. ``What was outwardly
an irreproachable picture of good family unity was inwardly misery
and exhausting conflicts,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Syrian Shelling Killing Fish Off Lebanon Near Beirut</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOUNIEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian shelling is killing fish in the
Mediterranean off this Christian enclave near Beirut and threatening
one of Lebanon's few natural resources, a government ecologist says.
   It also has cut sharply into the livelihoods of the enclave's 500
fishermen, but some are venturing out after dark to gather the
thousands of fish that float dead on the surface after each shelling.
   ``Our sea is dying,'' ecologist Pierre Malichev of the Health
Ministry said in an interview. ``It's become rotten and polluted.
Our marine life is nearing its end and we have no fish for next
year.''
   He estimated that millions of fish have been killed, along with
billions of their eggs.
   Malichev said fish that are not killed by the hundreds of
exploding 130mm howitzer shells and salvoes of rockets are being
poisoned by tetryl, one of the explosive elements in the shells that
is released into the water.
   All that remains for the fishermen are the dead fish.
   ``After a heavy round of shelling, the dead fish float like a
carpet on the surface,'' said Sirop Ornakian, one of about 75
fisherman who still go out.
   ``We usually wait a bit and then head for the carpet. Most times
I collect about 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of fish every trip.''
   The Syrians have been pounding the 28-mile coastal enclave and
its waters for six months to keep cargo ships and tankers from
running a blockade with supplies for the Christian forces of Gen.
Michel Aoun in the battle of Beirut.
   ``The shelling has killed our season,'' said Kivork Manoukian, a
fisherman for more than 40 years. ``Usually this time of the year is
the best for us, when we make some money. But this year's been
catastrophic.''
   He and other fishermen sat around the shady courtyard of his
house in Jounieh, 12{ miles north of Beirut, smoking an Arabic water
pipe.
   ``This is what our life is now,'' he said.
   His friend, Arten Khishkhishian, said he does not go out any more
because his nets were torn by twisted rocket casings and lumps of
shrapnel littering the shallow waters off Jounieh and the ancient
port of Byblos a few miles north.
   ``I've had to repair my net three times and that cost more than
100,000 pounds ($200),'' he said. ``I decided to stop this `shrapnel
fishing' until there's lasting peace.''
   But the others risk their lives and their boats, 15-foot craft
powered by outboard motors, to haul in the dead fish. Sometimes a
Syrian barrage will come unexpectedly. Police said several fishermen
have been wounded.
   Kevork Manoukian said that on one recent night ``it looked quiet
so I dropped my net.''
   ``Then the next minute a shell hit about 100 meters away from my
boat,'' he said. ``I ditched my net and made it for the shore in
panic as more shells exploded around me.''
   Ornakian and other fishermen regularly go out for catches not
much bigger than those they were netting before the fighting.
   With fish in short supply in the enclave, the price has doubled
to the equivalent of about $4.50 a pound.
   Ornakian and the others reckon that the money they make from each
trip _ the equivalent in Lebanese pounds of about $250 _ is worth
the chance.
   Moslem fishermen are banned from the waters off Beirut, where the
Syrians have deployed batteries of long-range artillery along the
waterfront to shell the Christian coastline.
   But the Moslems are able to fish south of Beirut for 50 miles
down the coast to the ancient port of Tyre, where the biggest danger
they face is an occasional Israeli gunboat.

<HEAD>`Correction' Due for Stocks?</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In any conversation about the stock market these
days, the word ``correction'' is almost sure to come up.
   Stock prices, somebody will declare, are undergoing, have
undergone, or are about to undergo a correction after reaching
record highs just before Labor Day.
   After all, the market has come a long way in recent months and
presumably must pause at some point, if only to allow investors time
to get used to the idea of buying at such lofty levels.
   The term ``correction'' is much beloved among stockbrokers,
useful as it is in soothing the complaints and misgivings of their
customers when stock prices are going in the wrong direction.
   It may be a euphemism _ akin to ``correctional institution'' for
prison _ but it's an ingeniously designed euphemism that often
achieves its desired effect.
   For one thing, it implies that a decline in stock prices is a
good and constructive thing, just a temporary pullback that purges
the market of over-enthusiasm and other excesses and prepares it for
the next sweeping move ahead to new highs.
   For another, it allows for great flexibility in the tricky art of
financial forecasting. The optimist has only to proclaim that prices
are headed higher with, of course, ``inevitable corrections along
the way.''
   As stock prices were beginning to cave in during the weeks
leading up to the crash of 1987, many a respected prognosticator
offered the reassurance that the market was merely going through a
long-overdue correction.
   They may have looked foolish for a while. But with the passage of
time, such people can claim they were right after all.
   Sure, it was a correction of monster proportions. But it achieved
what a textbook correction is supposed to do.
   It scared complacent money out of the market, creating the
reserve of buying power that could subsequently carry prices onward
to new highs.
   If that was a big correction, there have been some much smaller
ones since. Over the span of a few days in June, for instance, the
Dow Jones industrial average fell 91.81 points, or 3.63 percent.
   The early-September decline of 87.20 points, or 3.17 percent,
appeared similar to William LeFevre, an analyst at Advest Inc. in
New York.
   ``It looks like the latest pause, mini-correction, or whatever,
has ended, LeFevre said. ``If the post-crash experience holds, and
we see no reason why it shouldn't, then the Dow will now work its
way back up to its old high (2,752) and then go on to a higher
high.''
   For his part, Joseph Barthel, an analyst at Wheat First Butcher &amp;
Singer, foresees further market weakness over the next few weeks.
   But ``by mid- to late-October, the correction should have run its
course and the stock market can again reassert itself on the
upside,'' Barthel maintains.
   Analysts at the Merrill Lynch Market Letter talk of a pullback
still to come.
   ``We are not too happy to be in the crowd expecting a near-term
correction,'' they say. ``There is a possibility that the correction
will take longer to develop than most people expect.
   ``The longer the correction takes to occur, the deeper it is
likely to be. In our view, that could mean a setback closer to 10
percent from whatever highs are reached rather than the 5 percent
retreat that appears to be the general expectation.''

   Albert Campion acts like a superficial,
flippant twit. But what can you expect from a detective who says he
specializes in fairy tales?
   ``He's fairly hard to fathom,'' said Peter Davison, the English
actor who plays the 1930s sleuth in ``Campion,'' an eight-part
series that kicks off the fall season for PBS' ``Mystery!'' next
Thursday.
   Davison was one of several actors who portrayed ``Doctor Who'' in
a British series that has attained cult status and he appeared in
``All Creatures Great and Small.''
   His view of the detective he now plays:
   ``People think he doesn't take things seriously or doesn't
understand what's going on. It's really a device to keep suspects
off guard. He wears little, round horn-rimmed glasses. We've decided
those probably aren't real and are just part of the image, too.''
   ``Campion'' is adapted from the books by British crime writer
Margery Allingham, a peer of Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers.
   When the new series arrives on PBS, so will Diana Rigg, now more
than 21 years removed from her crime-fighting days on ``The
Avengers.'' She is succeeding Vincent Price as host of ``Mystery!''
   Davison finds Campion himself a bit of a mystery.
   ``He's a slightly enigmatic figure and it's not made clear in the
books what he's really about,'' the actor said. ``He's the youngest
son of a duke who's gone off to seek adventure. In the 1930s it was
the practice to send the youngest son off to the colonies. But he
didn't want to do that and set himself up as a private detective.''
   Campion's manservant, Davison said, is a big, bald ex-convict
with a fairly memorable name _ Magersfontein Lugg. ``He's given up
his criminal activities,'' Davision explained, ``but he's a source
of priceless information for Campion.''
   Incidentally, the actor added, Campion is not the detective's
real name. ``Someone calls him Christopher Twelvetrees and someone
else calls him Orlando,'' he said, but by any name ``he's obviously
a gentleman and well-mannered and is equally at home with the
aristocracy or criminals and Gypsies.''
   Brian Glover plays Lugg and Andrew Burt is Inspector Stanislaus
Oates of Scotland Yard.
   British critics have said the major strength of the ``Campion''
books were the outrageous plots and their many twists. The opening
story, ``Look to the Lady,'' features witches, Gypsies and
criminals, plus a priceless chalice and a secret room in a mansion
tower containing a ``Nameless Horror.''
   Davison said Allingham wrote some of the books as cerebral
exercises and some as ripping yarns. She also peopled her books with
a lot of Americans, but some have been taken out. A main character
in the first show was changed from an American to a Scot.
   Most of the stories take place in England, although one is set on
a cruise ship. One show's opening scene, set on the French Riviera
in the book, was changed to avoid a costly trip to film just one
scene.
   Davison grew up in south London and began acting in an
after-school drama club. ``I never did well academically,'' he said.
``It was always a last-minute scramble to put things together. So I
went to drama school instead of university. I worked in a dry
cleaners and a factory and was a hospital orderly before starting
school.''
   Davison, married about 10 years to American actress Sandra
Dickinson, has an apartment in Los Angeles. They met at the Central
School of Speech and Drama.
   ``I don't think we ever said a word to each other in school,'' he
said. ``I was aware of her, but we were in different years. Then we
did a rock musical version of `A Midsummer Night's Dream' at the
Edinburgh Festival. Sandra has become quite well-known in England.''
   Davison said he never trained for a second career in case acting
didn't work out.
   ``A lot of actors are trained in something else,'' he said. ``The
temptation is to take another job when things turn bad. When I had a
bad period I had nothing else to turn to. I spent three years in
repertory theater, then I decided I should go into television. I
didn't work for a year.''
   His first major role was in ``Love for Lydia,'' which played on
public TV's Masterpiece Theatre. He was Tristram, one of two
brothers, in the series ``All Creatures Great and Small,'' which was
based on James Herriot's stories about his life as a Yorkshire
veterinarian.
   He followed Tom Baker as ``Doctor Who,'' a science fiction
fantasy that has a large cult following worldwide. He was the fifth
actor in the role, playing it from 1981 to 1984.

<HEAD>Recession Worries Won't Go Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite impressive evidence lately of continued
economic growth, some Wall Streeters are not yet convinced that the
threat of a recession has been completely neutralized.
   If a business slump should set in, they contend, the stock market
is in danger of being caught off guard.
   After all, they say, the stock market is just three weeks and a
few percentage points away from the record highs set just before
Labor Day weekend.
   Wall Streeters seem to be thoroughly sold on the ``soft landing''
theory _ that the Federal Reserve could slow the economy enough to
restrain inflation without inflicting much economic pain.
   Should things not work out that way, the reasoning goes, traders
could well be in for a rapid reappraisal of the prices stocks ought
to command.
   In theory at least, stocks shouldn't be vulnerable to many
surprises of that kind. The collective vision of investors is
supposed to be so sharp that it can detect future fluctuations in
the economy earlier than almost any other forecasting system.
   But that isn't always the case, contends A.C. Moore, research
director at Argus Research Corp. in New York.
   ``Stock prices many times have gone right up into the teeth of
recessions,'' he says.
   Argus this past week advised investors to reduce their exposure
to stocks, in large measure because of ``a high prospect of a
recession coming up,'' in Moore's words.
   Others who agree with him cite the very sluggish growth of the
nation's money supply over the past couple of years as a forewarning
of trouble.
   ``Federal Reserve actions have resulted in a major slowdown in
economic growth since early 1987,'' said Erich Heinemann, economist
at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.
   ``Prelude to recession: Employment has slowed, consumers are dead
in the water, profits are down.''
   Of course, to stay with such a negative view on Wall Street right
now, you need to be willing to travel without much company.
   The resounding consensus in the financial world is that recent
healthy signs from most sectors of the economy have pretty much
dispelled the recession fears of a few months ago.
   As Paul Boltz, financial economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in
Baltimore, put it: ``Recent economic statistics are pointing to a
continuation of moderate growth, not a recession.''
   Besides, the bulls argue, the data on inflation have been so good
in the last couple of months that the Fed can feel ready to
stimulate the economy quickly at the first sign of possible trouble.
   For the moment at least, stock traders seem unwilling to take
sides in this debate. As a result, stock prices spent the past week
going just about nowhere.
   At the close on Friday the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
stood at 2,681.61, up 1.33 points from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.14 to 192.73;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
0.50 to 468.07, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 1.74 at 381.38.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 139.09 million shares a day,
against 165.52 million the week before.
   The main gripe on the Street of late hasn't been the state of the
economy, but rather the lack of activity in stocks.
   That could change soon, contends Joseph Feshbach, technical
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``I expect the market to be very volatile over the next couple of
months, with a series of rallies and corrections followed by more
prolonged weakness either late this year or early in 1990,'' he said
in his latest commentary.
   ``I therefore continue to believe prudence dictates a defensive
posture near term.''

   Statistics say 37.2 million students are in
America's public school classrooms on a typical day. At an average
annual cost of $4,500 each.
   Statistics say many things about education in the United States.
   For instance, 46.1 million students attended public and private
schools in the 1987-88 term. Of that, 32.4 million were in
kindergarten through the eighth grade; 13.7 million were in grades
9-12.
   Teaching the public school students were 2,308,900 teachers _
1,332,487 in elementary schools and junior highs and 976,413 in high
schools. Their average pay: $29,567, up 5.6 percent from a year
earlier.
   Total public school spending in the 1988-89 school year was an
estimated $185.9 billion, or an average of $4,500 a student, up 5.8
percent over a year earlier.
   And those numbers just touch the landscape of education
statistics. Among others:
   _As of the 1987-88 year, total grade school and junior high
enrollment had risen 2.5 percent since 1980, when 31.6 million
students were enrolled in public and private schools. High school
enrollment had risen 3.0 percent, from 13.3 million, in the same
period.
   _As of 1986, boys outnumbered girls 16.1 million to 15.0 million
in elementary school and junior high and 7.1 million to 6.9 milion
in high school.
   _Of the 40.3 million full-time public school students, average
daily attendance was estimated at 37.2 million.
   _There were 15,309 operating public school districts in the
1987-88 year.
   _Public schools employed 1,332,487 elementary school teachers and
976,413 high school instructors.
   _Total 1988-89 public school spending was estimated at $185.9
billion, including current expenses, capital outlays and interest
expenses.
   _Current expenses were $167.9 billion, up from $157.6 billion a
year earlier.
   Statistics also show the value of education.
   A 1984 Census Bureau study said the average college graduate
makes 83 percent more than someone who graduated only from high
school. The average holder of a professional degree, such as a
lawyer or doctor, made twice the income of someone with an
undergraduate degree and five times the income of someone who never
finished high school.
   How long do most people stay in school?
   Americans average 12.7 years of education. The averages for
various groups are: white males, 12.8; white females, 12.6; black
males, 12.4; black females, 12.4; Hispanic males, 12.1; and Hispanic
females, 12.0.
   Among those aged 25 and over, 2.4 percent had completed less than
five years of schooling. For whites that figure was 2 percent, while
5 percent of blacks and nearly 12 percent of Hispanics had 5 years
or less of school.
   Some 35.5 percent of Americans 18 and older ended their education
with a high school diploma; 26 percent never finished high school.
   Beyond that, 3.4 percent added an associate degree, 10.6 percent
went on to get a bachelor's degree, 3.4 percent added a master's
degree and 1.5 percent earned a doctorate or professional degree.
Nearly 18 percent attended college but did not graduate.

   The economy grew at a moderate 2.5 percent pace
in the second quarter, the government said, down from the first
quarter but strong enough to stop any new predictions of an imminent
recession.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that April-June growth
in the gross national product compared with a 3.7 percent gain in

   Nearly two-thirds of the January-March strength came from an

<HEAD>Griffin and Campeau: A Tale of Takeovers Gone Wrong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At first glance they appear vastly different: A
singer and television star turned successful businessman, and a high
school dropout who built his way up to become a millionaire
developer.
   But Merv Griffin and Robert Campeau, to their chagrin, have much
in common. Both men find their companies struggling because they
can't handle debts run up in notorious takeover battles.
   Griffin's Resorts International Inc. is trying to restructure a
$900 million debt after failing to meet interest payments to
bondholders. Resorts, which operates hotels and casinos, is not
generating enough cash to pay bills.
   Campeau, meanwhile, was forced to cede control of his retailing
empire to Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. in exchange for a $250
million loan.
   His company, Campeau Corp., also could not meet interest payments
on some of its $11.5 billion debt, and the developer has had to put
his prize Bloomingdale's department store chain up for sale.
   Resorts has attributed some of its problems to competition from
newer casinos in Atlantic City, poor management and deteriorating
physical facilities.
   Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp. have suffered from the same lackluster sales that have
afflicted other retailers.
   But the real problem is that Merv Griffin and Robert Campeau paid
too much for their companies, went too deeply into debt and did not
anticipate that their cash flow would be inadequate to handle their
interest payments.
   Griffin battled with developer Donald Trump over Resorts for
months last year with on-again, off-again agreements before finally
buying the company for $364 million and the assumption of $600
million in debt. Griffin issued $325 million in notes to help
finance the deal.
   Campeau waged a bidding war with R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. early in
1988 before winning Federated for a total price tag of $8.8 billion.
He went deeply into debt, increasing the liabilities he incurred
over a year earlier when he triumped in a $3.4 billion battle for
Allied.
   Griffin and Campeau were all smiles on winning these fights. Both
were on top of the world, each believing he had cut a great deal and
achieved glory after years of hard work.
   They came by their money in very different ways.
   Griffin is one of the best-known entertainers in the United
States. He began his career as a singer and film actor and then
moved to television, where he hosted game shows including ``Play
Your Hunch'' and for 23 years had his own talk show.
   But behind the affable exterior Griffin presented to television
audiences was a shrewd businessman. He founded his own production
company, Merv Griffin Enterprises, which turned out programs
including the ``Merv Griffin Show'' ``Wheel of Fortune'' and
``Jeopardy.''
   He also bought radio stations and assembled an extensive real
estate portfolio, with holdings in Beverly Hills and Northern
California.
   In 1986, Griffin sold his production company in 1986 to Coca-Cola
Co. for a reported $250 million, but kept his role as chairman.
   Campeau's background is less spectacular.
   He was born into a poor Ontario family and left school at 14 to
help support his brothers and sisters. Campeau was a factory foreman
in Ottawa in 1949, building a home for his family in his spare time,
when he got the idea to sell the house instead and make a profit.
   Campeau continued building houses and was on his way to becoming
a prominent builder. Over the years, he developed part of the
lakefront area of Toronto, now a fashionable area, put up office and
government buildings and became increasingly wealthy in the process.
   He tried his hand at takeovers in Canada, and failing there,
turned his sights toward the United States and Allied.
   Neither Campeau nor Griffin is exactly going about with hat in
hand now, but they are taking some lumps to try to keep their
companies going.
   In exchange for the loan from Olympia &amp; York, Campeau gave up
control of his company, and Bloomingdale's may not be the only
assets he will be forced to sell.
   This is not the first time Campeau has surrendered control of his
company. In 1969 he sold a majority share in return for cash for
expansion, a move he regretted, but later bought back the stake at a
premium.
   Griffin has had to ask his company's bondholders to back a debt
restructuring. He could have a hard time getting their approval:
Ninety percent of each class of bonds must approve the restructuring
for it to take effect.

<HEAD>Court Ruling Threatens Government Suits Against Employers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen government lawsuits alleging
age discrimination by employers may have to be dismissed unless
Congress restores protections overturned by the Supreme Court, a
government lawyer testified.
   Charles A. Shanor, general counsel of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, spoke at a House hearing Thursday in support
of legislation to reverse a June ruling that bias in fringe benefits
is not automatically banned under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act.
   The high court ruled 7-2 that federal law bans biased benefit
plans only where the disparities are part of an attempt to
discriminate in ``some non-fringe-benefit aspect'' of employment
such as hiring or firing.
   Shanor said the EEOC has more than 30 cases pending in courts
around the country in which it alleges that employers discriminated
against older workers by limiting their fringe benefits.
   ``We estimate that over half of these cases would require
dismissal ... absent remedial legislation,'' Shanor told a joint
hearing of the House Select Committee on Aging and two Education and
Labor subcommittees.
   EEOC Vice Chairman R. Gaull Silberman told the hearing there is
``no good policy reason for allowing arbitrary, unjustifiable
discrimination against older workers in this one area when all other
aspects of their employment are protected.'' She said more than 400
cases pending before the EEOC at the administrative level could be
affected by the Supreme Court ruling.
   The court ruled in a lawsuit filed by June Betts, a county speech
pathologist in Ohio who at age 61 was denied disability benefits
when Alzheimer's disease left her unable to work. The benefits were
available only to those age 60 or under.
   Betts' daughter, Carolyn, testified that her mother, now in a
nursing home at age 65, is being denied ``a benefit that a
25-year-old employee would have been entitled to under the same
circumstances.''
   ``My mother and people like her earned these benefits as surely
as younger employees,'' Ms. Betts said. ``Is it right that they
should be taken away from her because of her age?''
   Scott J. Macey, vice president of the ERISA Industry Committee
which represents more than 125 of the nation's largest employers,
said the group opposes discrimination against older workers but is
against the proposed legislation.
   The bill ``would impose unnecessary and harmful restrictions on
employers, effectively preventing employers from targeting benefits
to the employees who need them most,'' Macey said.

   Union Carbide Corp. says it has developed a
process for making foam seat and furniture cushions that eliminates
the use of environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons.
   An international treaty has called for phasing out
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, because the gasses damage the
atmospheric ozone. That ozone layer provides protection against the
sun's ultraviolet rays.
   The United States has set a goal of eliminating CFCs by the year
2000 if substitutes are found.
   The technology developed by Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics
Co. of Danbury, Conn., will begin to be made available to
foam-cushion manufacturers before the end of the year, with
widespread use expected within two years, company spokesman Steven
Gabelman said Thursday.
   About 10 percent of all CFCs released into the air worldwide come
from the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam cushions found in
bedding, seats, furniture and various padding, according to industry
figures.
   The chemical industry has been scrambling in recent years to
develop substitutes for CFCs, which are used as a blowing agent in
manufacturing the foam, among other uses.
   Union Carbide announced a year ago that it had developed a
product called Ultracel foam, which eliminates the need of a blowing
agent such as CFCs in the manufacture of high-grade flexible foam,
about 20 percent of the market. Other companies quickly developed a
similar product.
   Thursday's annoucement involves a similar process _ Geolite foam
technology _ that would be used in manufacturing lower-grade foams
widely used for quilting fabrics, pillows, chair cushions,
insulation and packaging. That covers the remaining 80 percent of
the flexible foam industry, according to Union Carbide.
   The process, as well as use of a special polymer, eliminates the
need to rely on a blowing agent to expand the flexible foam, said
John Televantos, director of research and development for Union
Carbide's speciality chemical division.
   The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that about 35
percent of CFCs are used in refrigeration and air conditioning,
areas where industry also has moved toward their gradual
elimination. Another 34 percent are used in various plastic foams
from fast food packaging to cushions.
   The new process involves only foams used as flexible cushions.
   Televantos said the Geolite process is expected to be widely
accepted as a substitute for CFCs because it results in no reduction
in the quality and firmness needed for seat and furniture cushions
and costs about the same, or less, than the process that uses CFCs.

<HEAD>Gasoline Futures Move Higher Due to Refinery Damaged by Hugo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy analysts say Amerada Hess Corp. should not
have problems meeting its commitments to U.S. customers despite
severe damage from Hurricane Hugo to a major refinery at St. Croix,
Virgin Islands, which sent gasoline futures prices surging.
   The 545,000-barrel-a-day facility, which was wrecked when the
storm smashed into the Virgin Islands earlier this week, supplies
markets in the eastern United States.
   By drawing on inventories or buying on the cash market, Hess
should be able to supply its customers, analysts said. The company
has refused to comment on how it will meet its obligations, but a
company spokesman stressed there would be no disruption in supplies.
   News that hurricane damage would shut down the huge refinery for
about 60 days sent gasoline futures prices soaring for the second
day Thursday.
   The October contract for unleaded gasoline closed 2.12 cents
higher at 61.86 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
for a two-day increase of 4.19 cents. Heating oil for October
delivery rose 1.03 cents to 57.58 cents a gallon after rising 1.60
cents in the previous session.
   Contracts for delivery later in the year posted much smaller
gains.
   Analysts said gasoline prices on the futures market could go even
higher in the short-term. Hess has said the refinery would resume
partial operations in about 30 days.
   ``We've gotten to the point where refined product markets are in
such basis equilibrium that when they lose any production it does
cause tightness,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the
energy group at Elders Futures Inc. ``So probably we will see prices
move up.''
   Sustained higher prices could be passed on to retail customers in
another 30 days or so, analysts said, but if they erode fairly
quickly as some anticipate, there could be little effect at the
gasoline pump.
   ``We believe the excess capacity will be made up by refineries
abroad,'' said James Steel, energy analyst at Refco Inc. ``It also
will probably push U.S. refineries back above the 90 percent level.''
   U.S. refiners recently slowed to about 89.8 percent capacity
after pumping at a strong 92 percent during the peak summer months,
Steel said.
   Hess also announced Thursday that it would not be able to provide
petroleum products for ships loading at its refinery in St. Croix.
   ``We're talking about other ships, not ours, that buy an
occasional load from us,'' said a Hess spokesman who did not want to
be identified. ``We stand by our original statement that we will
meet all our commitments to U.S. customers.''
   Crude oil futures traded on the New York exchange were mixed,
with the contract for November delivery falling 6 cents to $19.62 a
barrel. Contracts for later delivery rose slightly.
   Amerada's refinery was shut down Saturday in preparation for
Hugo. The refinery had been producing about 400,000 barrels a day of
gasoline, distillates and other products, most of which are used in
the United States.

<HEAD>J.P. Morgan Loan-Loss Decision is Bad News for Debtor Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Inc.'s painful decision to add
$2 billion to its reserve cushion against loan losses is bad news
for Third World nations in debt, analysts say.
   Morgan, the nation's third-largest banking company, cited
intensifying political and economic problems in debtor nations
Thursday as it announced that the addition to its reserves would
result in a $1.8 billion loss in its current quarter.
   Chase Manhattan Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. announced
similar steps earlier in the week, but Morgan's was the most
drastic. It boosted its reserves to 100 percent of its medium- and
long-term loans to developing countries, more than double the
reserve fraction established by the others.
   Morgan's action could complicate talks on debt-reduction plans
that are part of the annual meetings in Washington of the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund. Delegates from 152 nations began
arriving for those talks Thursday.
   Morgan and other big banks that have begun facing up to the
likelihood of huge losses on loans to developing countries are
unlikely to resume large-scale lending to those nations for many
years, analysts said.
   ``Bankers do have short memories. But once a bank loses a billion
dollars on any sort of a loan, they don't come back very quickly.
Maybe 20 years from now,'' said Stephen Berman, an analyst at County
Securities USA in New York.
   Morgan, the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., said it would
continue doing business in developing countries but would focus on
merchant banking rather than general lending. Merchant banking
involves providing advice, trading and investing, and finance.
   ``We will continue to consider lending in appropriate specific
transactions. We intend to continue to play a constructive role in
developing countries,'' Morgan spokeswoman Kathleen Baum said.
   The talks in Washington will concern Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady's plan to relieve the $1.3 trillion Third World debt through
debt forgiveness rather than new lending.
   Some banks are concerned that the Brady plan may have caused
debtor nations to lose their sense of urgency about keeping up on
their loan payments. Morgan said debtor nations seem to have
overestimated how much help is forthcoming from the industrial
nations.
   ``We are very concerned about debtor countries' rising
expectations of the magnitude of debt reduction possible under the
Brady initiative,'' Lewis T. Preston, Morgan's chairman, said in a
statement.
   The Treasury Department said Morgan's increase in reserves was
not a direct result of the Brady plan. It said banks would actually
need lower reserves under the plan, since they would be scratching
some shaky loans off their books.
   But analysts said the Brady plan is forcing bankers to
acknowledge the depth of their troubles in developing countries.
They are responding by doing everything possible to extricate
themselves.
   Morgan's financial strength allowed it to cleanse its books more
completely than Chase or Manufacturers Hanover. It means the company
will not suffer any further losses even if developing countries
don't pay another cent on their medium- and long-term loans.
   ``Some banks just want out,'' Berman said. ``Early on in this
process everybody sort of pulled together, followed the lead of
Citibank. Everybody is sort of cutting and running now and pursuing
their own interest.''
   Morgan now has a total of $3 billion in loan-loss reserves, with
$2.8 billion of that unofficially allocated to loans to developing
countries. That $2.8 billion is equal to 70 percent of Morgan's
total loans to developing countries, and 100 percent of the
medium-and long-term loans to those nations. In an indication of
Morgan's strong finances, Moody's Investors Service Inc. and
Standards and Poor's Corp. on Thursday both confirmed their
investment-grade ratings on Morgan senior debt.
   The last big round of additions to loan-loss reserves came in
late 1987, and many banking companies have not taken any action
since then.
   For example, Chemical Banking Corp.'s loan-loss reserves equal
just 28 percent of its medium- and long-term loans to developing
countries.
   At Chase and Manufacturers Hanover, the corresponding reserves
are 46 percent and 36 percent, respectively.
   Before the formal sessions of the IMF and World Bank in
Washington, finance officials of the world's seven richest countries
were scheduled to hold talks all day Saturday to review global
economic issues.

<HEAD>Texas Air Discussing Sale of Stake in Reservation System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prized part of Texas Air Corp., its
computerized reservation system, is now on a list of possible items
for sale by the nation's biggest airline company because of a cash
crunch.
   Sources said Thursday that Texas Air is discussing the sale of a
stake in its reservation system to a General Motors Corp. unit,
Electronic Data Systems Corp., partly to ease the pressure caused by
the strike and bankruptcy proceeding at Texas Air's Eastern Airlines.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent in Houston and Roger Still, a
spokesman for Electronic Data Systems in Dallas, both declined to
comment on the matter Thursday. But sources close to the situation
said the airline company was looking for a partner for the
reservation subsidiary, called System One.
   The Wall Street Journal reported in its Thursday editions that
talks between Texas Air and Electronic Data Systems were advanced
and that barring a snag, an agreement could be reached soon.
   The Journal indicated the companies were discussing the sale of
System One in its entirety, but sources told The Associated Press it
would likely be a partial sale.
   Analysts estimate the value of System One, the nation's
third-largest airline reservation system, at $300 million to $400
million.
   The participation of GM in System One would mark the first
non-airline owner of a computer reservation system, which might be
more acceptable to government regulators, who have expressed worries
about consolidation in the field.
   In addition to the work it performs for GM, EDS is involved in
health insurance, government and financial institution data
processing and is looking for sources of revenue that will make it
less dependent on its parent.
   Selling System One would be a radical move for Texas Air Chairman
Frank Lorenzo, who has underlined the importance of computer
reservation systems to airlines' competitiveness. Those systems have
been undergoing rapid changes and consolidations recently.
   Earlier this week, Delta Air Lines disclosed it was discussing
merging its reservation system with PARS, an operation jointly owned
by Trans World Airlines Inc. and Northwest Airlines. And American
Airlines' Sabre reservation system has been seeking a partner after
the Justice Department quashed its plans to link up with Delta's
system.
   System One was transferred from Eastern to Texas Air in April
1987 for about $100 million. A member of the Air Line Pilots
Association, one of the three unions on strike against Miami-based
Eastern since March 4, has a lawsuit pending in New York state
Supreme Court challenging the transfer and claiming that Texas Air
paid too little for System One.
   Court-appointed bankruptcy examiner David I. Shapiro is studying
the transfer as part of his investigation of transactions between
Texas Air, Eastern and sister carrier Continental Airlines. Shapiro
was out of the country Thursday and unavailable for comment.
   The reservation system is ``the heart of any airline,'' said Hank
Weber, an ALPA spokesman in Miami. ``It's an indication that he
(Lorenzo) really is in need of money quickly.''
   Talk about the reservation system comes at a time when Texas Air
is taking a number of steps to shore up the foundations of its
airline empire. Late last month, Lorenzo announced that he was
considering selling all or part of Houston-based Continental.
   Last week, a federal bankruptcy judge approved a plan in which
Texas Air would help with a payment of $98.3 million Eastern owes to
employee pension plans. Texas Air is lending Eastern $45 million
toward the payment, Eastern is paying $27 million with the proceeds
of asset sales, and the rest has been deferred until July.
   Texas Air has given no indication of what it might do with the
proceeds from any sale.
   ``The airline is just looking at their options,'' said Raymond
Neidl, an analyst for investment firm Dillon, Read &amp; Co. Inc. The
sale of part of System One ``certainly would give them money to
expand and enhance the system.''
   Louis Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia, said Texas Air appears to be trying to raise cash.
``It sounds like a continuation of this business with Continental,''
he said.
   In the May-July quarter, Texas Air posted a $109.3 million net
loss as losses at Eastern far outweighed a modest profit at
Continental. The company lost $255.9 million in the same quarter
last year.

   American Airlines, historically a leader in
lowering the cost of air travel, also has shown its enormous
influence in raising prices too.
   Several of American's principal competitors have matched its
initiative that will increase some discount fares by more than 15
percent and double cancellation penalties.
   Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines and Pan Am Corp. said
Thursday they were following American's move. The increases,
proposed by American earlier this week, will take effect Sept. 29.
   United Airlines and Northwest Airlines were still studying the
matter and hadn't decided yet, spokesmen for those carriers said.
   American, based in Dallas, is one of the largest U.S. carriers
and helped pioneer fare discounts in the deregulated airline
industry. In the past it has often been the first to announce
innovative discounts that competitors were forced to match.
   Under the fare increases, the popular ``MaxSaver'' cut-rate fare
often used by vacationers, which must be purchased 14 days in
advance, will be increased by $10 to $20 round trip. A ``MaxSaver''
ticket on American between Dallas and Los Angeles, for example,
would jump from $338 to $358 round trip. The ``MaxSaver'' tickets
would remain non-refundable.
   In addition, fares will be raised on seven-day advance tickets by
$30 to $60 round trip. The same Dallas-Los Angeles round trip ticket
bought seven days in advance would go from $378 to $438. The penalty
for changing or canceling a reservation would double to 50 percent
of the ticket price.
   Atlanta-based Delta said a sharp rise in fuel prices, along with
a large number of discount tickets sold recently, prompted the
airline to match the increases.
   ``Delta has held the line on discount-fare increases for over a
year, while we have seen record numbers of passengers utilizing the
most deeply discounted seats,'' Whit Hawkins, Delta's senior vice
president of marketing, said in a statement.
   ``At the same time, Delta's costs have been rising, most recently
impacted by a 6.65 cents-per-gallon increase in the cost of fuel.''
   The increases follow a recent rise in a type of discount fare
popular with business travelers, reflecting an effort by airlines to
partly recoup revenue lost from bargains offered this summer to fall
vacationers.
   American said it proposed the fare hikes in an effort to improve
its passenger yields.
   An airline's yield reflects the average revenue from passengers
for each mile flown and is a critical barometer of financial
strength.
   Many airline industry analysts expect little improvement in
yields overall for the rest of the year and into 1990.
   In mid-August, the airlines announced steep fare cuts for the
fall season, extending summer travel bargains. They slashed
round-trip fares by as much as $160 to lure passengers in the
historically weak autumn season. Most fares to Europe were reduced
by $100 into next spring.
   Last week, in an effort to recover some of the losses, the
airlines boosted ``Supercoach'' one-way fares, favored by business
fliers because they have more lenient advance-purchase requirements
than cheaper discount fares and don't require a Saturday-night stay.
   Those fares were raised by around $20 for a one-way ticket.

<HEAD>Reichmann Family Increases Its Considerable Power with Campeau Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reichmann family, emerging from intensive
maneuverings with a bigger piece of Campeau Corp.'s retail and real
estate empire, may not seek the spotlight but doesn't shun deals
that make public attention hard to avoid.
   ``There are more scholars than business tycoons among my
forebearers. All we children inherited was character, determination
and will power. ... And perhaps a little brains,'' Paul Reichmann,
who generally serves as the family spokesman, said in a rare
interview with the local Report on Business magazine.
   Paul, Albert and Ralph Reichmann were born in Austria after their
parents moved there in 1928. There were further moves to France,
Spain and Morocco before the family arrived in Canada in 1956.
   Their privately held Olympia &amp; York company now ranks as the
world's largest developer of office space, with interests in about
30 cities in Canada, the United States and Britain. Among them are
such huge projects as the World Financial Center in New York and
Canary Wharf in London.
   All of this _ a fortune estimated at $6 billion _ came from a
company that was tiny at the start of the 1960s.
   The move into real estate came when the family decided to build
its own warehouse for its Montreal tile business, Olympia Floor and
Wall Tile, in the late 1950s. Within a few years the Reichmanns were
building office towers, helped in part by a move to the booming
Toronto market of the 1960s.
   Olympia &amp; York was incorporated in 1969. The family's move into
the international top leagues usually is traced to the decision to
buy eight office buildings in Manhattan in 1977 when that market was
at a low point.
   Recently an attempt was made to buy the Sears Tower in Chicago.
   Their takeovers of newsprint producer Abitibi-Price in 1981 and
Gulf Canada Resources in 1985 placed them in visible spheres outside
of real estate.
   A struggle to take over the Canadian liquor company Hiram Walker
made it clear that even the savvy, seemingly charmed Reichmanns
could run into difficulties. That attempt ended with a swap of their
49 percent interest in the liquor company for 10 percent of the
large British conglomerate Allied-Lyons PLC.
   The Reichmanns are devout Orthodox Jews who live relatively
modestly in the affluent Toronto suburb of North York. The three
brothers have 14 children.
   Albert, 60, is the president, Paul, 58, the senior executive vice
president and secretary, and Ralph, 55, the executive vice president
and treasurer of Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.
   Paul Reichmann told Report on Business in December that the
family business is not particularly interested in just growing
bigger.
   ``What drives us is usually the challenge, to be creative, to do
something interesting. No successful businessman really has money in
mind after a certain point,'' he said. ``When we do something, we
want to do it right. It's not monument building; it's more than
that.''
   They gained 25 percent of Toronto-based Campeau Corp. after
providing financing that helped in its the takeover of Federated
Department Stores Inc. in February 1988. That stake expanded this
week to an estimated 35 percent with the recent round of Campeau
difficulties.
   Their movements are rarely heralded in advance, and even senior
Olympia &amp; York executives have been known to complain that they
don't know what project would attract the brothers' attention next.
   Although certainly not publicity seekers, the family, usually
Paul, does emerge to talk to reporters at times when their interests
favor public attention. Their reputation for shunning the limelight
increased after they filed an $86 million ($102 million Canadian)
libel suit in January 1988 against Toronto Life magazine for an
article called ``The Mysterious Reichmanns: The Untold Story.''
   The family then sued The Toronto Sun and the Globe and Mail
newspapers for their reports on the story and the suit.
   Paul Reichmann told Report on Business, which is a part of the
Globe and Mail, that the decision to sue was the most agonizing one
he ever made because the family's privacy would be jeopardized even
more.
   He said the suit was filed to set the record straight about his
parents' activities in North Africa during World War II and not to
discourage publicity about the family.
   ``Because of our position in world Jewry and in Canadian business
we had no choice,'' he said. ``We will spare no cost, time or effort
until every part of this story is proved false in a court of law.''

<HEAD>Former Bank of Japan Governor Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Haruo Maekawa, former Bank of Japan Governor and
chief architect of a landmark 1986 blueprint for reorienting Japan
away from exports toward a domestic-led economy, died Friday. He was
78.
   Maekawa was the 24th governor of the central bank for five years
between December 1979 and December 1984. Since, he was chairman of
Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co., Ltd. (KDD).
   Maekawa became known among Japan's trading partners because of
the so-called Maekawa Report, a landmark Japanese economic policy
paper published in 1986 under then prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   The report, published by a 17-member government committee for
international cooperation headed by the former bank governor, warned
that Japan's excessive trade surpluses would endanger the world
economy, and urged the country to change its economic policy to
encourage consumption and boost imports.
   It also called for reexamination of the tax system, improvement
of the industrial structure and the import of more agricultural
products.
   ``The death of Mr. Maekawa, whose achievements contributed a
great deal internationally, means a serious loss to Japan when we
are facing difficulties in the external environment,'' said the
central bank governor Satoshi Sumita in a statement.
   ``He was an appealing human being and his vision greatly
contributed to improving many domestic and international problems
including the stabilization of foreign exchange, and aggravated debt
problems, Sumita said..
   ``As the Bank of Japan governor, Mr. Maekawa gave price stability
a priority of his monetary policy, while he greatly contributed to
financial liberalization,'' the central bank chief said.
   After graduating from prestigious Tokyo University in 1935,
Maekawa served the central bank for 49 years until he retired in
1984. After his retirement, he was a special advisor to
International Business Machines Corp. in Japan 1985 and then was KDD
chairman.
   Maekawa, who died of a nasal tumor at a Tokyo hospital, is
survived by his wife Taka and two sons. His funeral will be held at
a buddhist temple in Tokyo next Monday, according to the Bank of
Japan.

   Four utilities seeking to control Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire begin their battles today before the
bankruptcy judge who will decide the fate of the state's largest
electricity producer.
   Among the bidders is Public Service itself, forced into U.S.
Bankruptcy Court 20 months ago under the financial stress of its
lead share in the $6.2 billion Seabrook nuclear plant.
   The other contenders are United Illuminating of New Haven, Conn.,
with a plan calling for merger with Public Service; Northeast
Utilities of Berlin, Conn., that state's largest electric utility;
and New England Electric System of Westborough, Mass.
   Judge James Yacos will hold hearings on the proposals through
mid-November, when stockholders and creditors will vote. If they
pick one, Yacos likely will abide by their choice. If they choose
two, he could pick one, or find another solution.
   Public Service believes it is the frontrunner because its plan
has the creditors' and stockholders' approval.
   The other plans do not. The other utilities would have to reach
such agreement and get approval from the Securities and Exchange and
Federal Energy Regulatory commissions. Public Service needs only
state regulator approval.
   But New England Electric's plan has the primary endorsement of
Gov. Judd Gregg because it had the lowest rate projections. The
state, however, has no vote in bankruptcy court, although Yacos
could consider the state's wishes.
   Public Service has noted that its rate plan falls under the
guidelines endorsed by Gregg when the Northeast plan was introduced
in July.
   Public Service valued its plan at $2.2 billion, regardless of
whether Seabrook operates. The plant has been completed for three
years, but lacks an operating license.
   Public Service, Northeast and United Illuminating all called for
seven annual rate increases of 5.5 percent if Seabrook operates.
Public Service and Northeast also tacked on 1.1 percent a year for
five of those years if the plant is canceled, and another 2.4
percent by the end of the period if lower-price contracts can't be
renegotiated with small power producers.
   This week, United Illuminating said it was willing to cut the 5.5
percent annual rate increases to five years, with the total rate
increase at 31 percent instead of the 45 percent in the initial plan.
   The NEES plan called for increases of 4.8 percent during the
seven years, a 39 percent overall increase.
   United Illuminating also valued its plan at $2.2 billion and
Northeast valued its at $1.9 billion regardless of Seabrook. New
England Electric was $1.9 billion if it does not operate, $2.0
billion if it does.
   Public Service, with almost 400,000 customers, filed for
bankruptcy under the burden of its largest 36 percent share of
Seabrook.
   United Illuminating's 17.5 percent is the second-largest share of
Seabrook. NEES and Northeast own smaller shares.

   The dream of weight-watching ice cream
lovers may be coming true: a fat- and cholesterol-free ice cream
that contains nearly one-third less calories.
   Kraft General Foods will introduce its new product _ Sealtest
Free Nonfat Ice Cream _ into New England markets during the first
week of October.
   Kraft, a division of of Philip Morris Cos. Inc., says the desert
has the appearance and taste of ice cream rich in butterfat.
   In the new product, the butterfat is replaced with cellulose gel,
a naturally occuring fiber found in fruit and vegetables.
   While the company is calling its new product ice cream, it may be
in for a regulatory battle since the Food and Drug Administration
requires at least 10 percent butterfat for the product to be called
ice cream.
   A spokesman for the FDA in Washington, Emil Corwin, said he was
unaware of Kraft's plan for the product.
   ``But if it is a matter of giving wrong information on the label,
it certainly would be an FDA concern,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Screening Methods May Cut Meatpacker Injuries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The meat industry is investigating several new
screening techniques that could reduce the incidence of carpal
tunnel syndrome among meatpackers, who suffer the painful wrist
injury at an unusually high rate.
   The techniques involve machines that measure the sensitivity of
fingers to vibration or to a low-level electrical current, said Dan
MacLeod, whose Minneapolis consulting firm, ErgoTech Inc., is
researching the devices with funding from the meat industry.
   MacLeod said the machines promise earlier detection of the first
symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, a degenerative nerve and muscle
disorder that can render hands and fingers inflexible and is often
attributed to the sort of forceful, repetitive motions demanded of
meatpackers.
   ``In the early stages of carpal tunnel syndrome, one of the signs
is that you lose your sense of feeling in your fingertips,'' MacLeod
said Thursday in a telephone interview.
   ``These things are good for overview screening of people who
should be referred for diagnosis,'' he said.
   Engineers can also use the devices to determine whether
experimental changes in working positions or equipment design
actually protect workers from injury, MacLeod said.
   ``It gives us a technology that we can use to see if we're doing
any good,'' he said.
   Meat industry leaders say they are testing the machines as part
of an effort to reduce repetitive-motion injuries, which occur at a
higher rate in their business than in any other.
   The American Meat Institute, an industry trade group, is also
working with labor and the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration to develop guidelines for making meatpacking plants
safer, said Manly Molpus, the group's president.
   ``Let me assure you that OSHA is not the meat industry's enemy.
Workplace accidents, injuries and illnesses are our enemies,''
Molpus said in remarks prepared for a news conference on Thursday,
the first day of the trade group's four-day meeting in Chicago.
   Bob Moore, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics said
cumulative trauma disorders, of which repetitive-motion injuries are
a majority in the meat industry, occured at a rate of 392.3 per
10,000 workers in 1987, more than 10 times the rate for general
manufacturing and nearly 40 times the rate for all private-sector
businesses.
   Many meatpackers have jobs requiring rapid repetition of cutting,
chopping, pulling or lifting motions.
   OSHA has levied heavy fines against several meatpackers in recent
years for violating laws designed to protect workers from
repetitive-motion injuries and other cumulative trauma disorders.
   Two of those cases, involving IBP Inc. of Dakota City, Neb., and
Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp., owner of the meat processer Hillshire
Farms, led to settlements requiring the companies to implement
safety-improvement plans within three years.
   Earlier this year, OSHA said it planned to make the meat industry
a model in the use of ergonomics to enhance worker safety. The meat
institute described ergonomics in a news release as ``the science of
fitting the job to the worker rather than making the worker fit the
job.''
   As part of its plan, OSHA invited the meat industry and labor to
help prepare guidelines for improving worker safety. OSHA officials
have said they hope to make the guidelines available to the industry
by late fall.

<HEAD>Guilty Plea Entered in Insider Trading Scheme</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former printing company salesman has pleaded
guilty to obtaining advance copies of Business Week and then trading
on information from the magazine's stock-tip column.
   Shayne Walters, 32, of Laguna Hills, Calif., pleaded guilty
Thursday in Manhattan federal court to a conspiracy count for the
insider trading and to perjury for lying under oath to an
investigator of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Walters, a former sales representative for R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons
Co., agreed to cooperate in a federal investigation of illegal
trading using purloined copies of the business weekly from 1986 to
1988. The magazine has not been charged.
   Donnelley is a Chicago-based printer of Business Week. Walters
worked for the company from January 1983 until April.
   He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each
of the two charges. He is to be sentenced April 24 by U.S. District
Judge John Walker Jr.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl Loewenson said his office would
recommend a lenient sentence for Walters based on the information he
gives the government.
   The conspiracy charge alleged that between September 1986 and
July 1988, Walters obtained advance copies of Business Week from the
Donnelley printing plant in Torrance, Calif., and then supplied them
to his stockbroker who traded on companies reported favorably in the
``Inside Wall Street'' column.
   Walters told the judge that he would leave his house at 3:45 a.m.
on Thursdays, the day the magazine was distributed, and drive 45
miles to the plant to get a copy of the magazine.
   He then would drive 45 miles home and give the magazine to his
stockbroker, Walters said. He also said the stockbroker, who was not
identified, paid him for some of the advance copies.
   Walters was the latest person to plead guilty to schemes
involving trading on prepublication copies of ``Inside Wall Street.''
   William Dillon, a former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. broker, and S.G.
(Rudy) Ruderman, the former broadcast editor for Business Week, had
previously pleaded guilty to similar charges and were each sentenced
to six months in prison.
   At least seven other Donnelley employees have either resigned or
been fired in wake of the Business Week scandal. The SEC also has
sued Dillon and five others.
   In a settlement reached with the SEC in August, Walters agreed to
pay $62,000 in restitution and civil penalties _ an amount double
his illegal profits.
   Papers filed by the SEC said Walters purchased and sold stock
from 13 companies based on information in the magazine and that the
stockbroker traded on more than 40 companies.
   The perjury charge said Walters lied to an SEC investigator on
March 16 when he said he had never seen an advance copy of Business
Week.

   The dollar drifted a bit higher against the Japanese
yen today before closing unchanged, while share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange gained for the second-consecutive day.
   After opening at 145.80 yen, up 0.80 yen from Thursday's close,
the currency ranged between 144.95 yen and 145.80 yen before closing
the week at 145.00 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained in a relatively narrow
range ahead of the scheduled meeting of the Group of Seven
industrialized countries on Saturday in Washington.
   ``It's not easy for the dollar to find either direction in the
Tokyo market,'' prior to a major international monetary meeting,
said Shigeru Tamaki, a dealer with the Industrial Bank of Japan.
   Participants in the Washington meeting to discuss international
monetary policy include financial ministers from the United States,
Japan, Britain, West Germany, Italy, Canada and France.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues gained 26.77 points, or 0.08 percent, closing the week at
34,771.79. The Nikkei gained 274.44 points Thursday.
   Volume traded on the first section stood at 650 million shares,
the same amount that exchanged hands the previous day.
   Yutaka Yoshino, a stock analyst with the Nikko Securities Co.,
said housing and distribution-related issues are among those
attracting investors recently.

<HEAD>Japanese Department Store Group Buys 10 Percent of Tiffany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese department store group has purchased
additional shares of Tiffany &amp; Co., increasing its stake in the
famed jewelry company from 3 percent to 13 percent, Tiffany says.
   Mitsukoshi Ltd., the principal distributor of Tiffany products in
Japan, agreed to buy 1.5 million additional Tiffany shares, said
William R. Chaney, Tiffany's chairman.
   ``We welcome Mitsukoshi as a significant investor,'' Chaney said
in a statement Thursday. ``Their investment strengthens and confirms
the community of interest which our two companies have shared since
1970.''
   By agreement, Mitsukoshi's stake in Tiffany many not exceed 19.99
percent of shares outstanding, Tiffany said.
   Mitsukoshi bought the shares from General Electric Capital Corp.,
a unit of General Electric Co. GE Capital acquired the shares when
it helped fund the management-led buyout of Tiffany from Avon
Products Inc. in 1984. It will continue to hold about 750,000 of the
2.25 million shares it now holds.
   ``We are excited about this investment, which reflects our
confidence in Tiffany's management group and our optimistic view
toward their continued pursuit of many worldwide business
opportunities,'' said Yoshinki Sakakura, president and chief
operating officer of Mitsukoshi.
   Mitshukoshi operates 19 department stores in Japan and other
stores elsewhere in Asia and in Europe and the United States.
   In Japan, it sells Tiffany merchandise through boutiques in its
stores and through hotels. It also distributes Tiffany products in
Hong Kong and Hawaii.
   In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, Mitshukoshi bought about $26
million worth of Tiffany goods. During that same period Tiffany had
worldwide sales of more than $290 million.

<TEXT>
   Bankers Trust Co. plans to become the first bank
to handle the public sale of a corporate bond issue as allowed under
a recent Federal Reserve Board ruling.
   In July, the Fed, over the objection of Wall Street investment
houses, granted banks the power to sell new corporate bond issues to
the public, overturning a restriction contained in the
Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act.
   That law was designed to segregate the businesses of banking and
securities. It was prompted by the practice of banks in the 1920s of
selling corporate securities at inflated prices, with the proceeds
used to repay bank loans.
   Under the change approved by the Fed, banks must sell any bond
issues through separately financed subsidiaries in order to ensure
that federally insured bank deposits are not involved in the
financings. These subsidiaries may not borrow from their parent
banks.
   In addition, the Fed imposed rules against the sharing of
information between the subsidiaries and the banks' loan officers.
   Bankers Trust's proposed bond issue involves $150 million in
high-yield, or junk, securities for Morningstar Foods Inc. of
Dallas, a producer and distributor of dairy products.
   The New York-based bank loaned $80 million to help a group of
Texas investors buy Morningstar from Southland Corp., operator of
the 7-Eleven convenience stores, in 1988.
   Some predict the entrance of banks into junk bond financing at a
time when the junk-bond market is unsettled could produce a backlash.
   ``If this does not scare the Federal Reserve, it will certainly
scare Congress,'' William J. Fitzpatrick, general counsel to the
Securities Industry Association, told The New York Times on today's
editions.
   ``Having just rescued the savings and loan industry, I don't
think Congress wants to see the banking industry involved in such
risky businesses,'' he said.
   The trade association has fought the entrance of banks into the
securities field.

   The stock market was mixed today, still stuck in
the neutral pattern of the past several sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.33 to 2,678.95
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 451 up, 393 down and 548
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.92 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said nothing had occurred to stir the market out of its
recent torpor.
   The rally that carried prices to record highs just before the
Labor Day weekend crested as it became evident that interest rates
had stopped falling.
   That left investors in something of a stalemate between those who
expect persistent economic growth at a moderate pace and those who
still believe a significant slowdown awaits in the not-too-distant
future.
   J.P. Morgan climbed 2 to 41}. Late Thursday the company increased
by $2 billion its reserves against problem loans to lesser-developed
countries.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.14 to 192.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .01 at 380.05.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average closed with a 3.61
loss at 2,680.28.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on the
NYSE, with 664 up, 755 down and 529 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 146.93 million shares, against 136.64
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   Consumer spending rose 0.9 percent in August,
its biggest advance in four months, while personal incomes edged up
0.4 percent for their ninth consecutive advance, the Commerce
Department reported today.
   The rise in consumer spending followed a 0.6 percent gain in July
and was the largest increase since a 1.1 percent advance last April.
The August spending rate was driven in part by strong auto sales.
Since then, however, auto sales have slowed.
   Nevertheless, today's report showed that consumer spending
continued to be strong at the midpoint of the July-September quarter.
   Consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of economic
health since it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity.
   The advance in personal incomes followed a 0.7 percent increase
in July. The slower pace was attributed to strikes against several
major telephone companies. Personal incomes have risen steadily
since a 0.3 percent decline in November 1988.
   The statistics on Americans' income growth and spending habits
provided fresh evidence that the economy is not in danger of
toppling into a recession.
   The report also showed that Americans' disposable, or after-tax
income rose 0.4 percent in August, down slightly from a 0.7 percent
after-tax increase in July.
   Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable
income, fell 6.7 percent, down from July's 1.7 percent increase.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
decreased $9.2 billion in August, down substantially from a $23.5
billion increase in July.
   Payrolls at manufacturing companies rose by $3.2 billion, up from
a July increase of $2.1 billion.
   On the spending side, the $31.8 billion gain in personal
consumption spending, which includes everything except interest
payments on debt, compared to a $21.1 advance in July.
   Purchases of durable goods, big-ticket items such as cars
expected to last more than three years, rose $22.9 billion compared
to a $3.4 billion gain in July.
   Purchases of non-durable goods fell $3.6 billion after increasing
$4.8 billion in the previous month.
   Purchases of services, which includes housing costs, rose $12.5
billion compared to a $13 billion increase in July.
   Overall, personal consumption spending came in at an annual rate
of $3.51 trillion in August following $3.48 trillion in July.
   Personal incomes totaled $4.47 trillion at an annual rate in
August following a revised $4.45 trillion in July.

<HEAD>Some Experts Say Junk Bond Market Permanently Damaged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The junk bond market's turmoil may have inflicted
lasting damage, making it more difficult to sell new issues and even
raising doubts among the investment houses that are its staunchest
backers, experts say.
   ``This was the first time that the market has really frozen,''
said Paul Getman, an economist with Wefa Group, an economic
consulting firm. ``It tells me that it is not a fully developed,
real market. Markets do not freeze.''
   Junk bond prices plunged a week and a half ago after Campeau
Corp., a major retailer and junk-bond issuer, said it would have
trouble paying its bills. Campeau's crisis mushroomed throughout the
junk-bond market, and for several days many junk issues had sellers
but no buyers.
   ``You shouldn't forget how this one incident that was limited to
one issue in the market triggered such adverse reaction elsewhere,''
said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
``It makes you wonder what would happen to junk bond prices if there
were several Campeaus together, which is not an unlikely possibility.
   ``God knows what's going to happen once a downturn finally
hits,'' he said.
   Junk bonds primarily are issued by companies that do not have an
investment-grade evaluation from a major credit rating agency. They
also are used to raise the cash needed in corporate takeovers.
Because of their poor ratings and high risk of default, they pay
more interest than investment-grade bonds.
   The $200 billion market in junk bonds lost an estimated $10
billion in value in the turmoil. It also prompted a pullout by many
investors in junk-bond mutual funds _ the only place where small
investors would have direct exposure to the high-yield market.
   Though the market recovered somewhat last week, jitters remain.
   ``The junk bond market still faces considerable uncertainty,''
said Lonski. He added that the Campeau debacle was ``a shocker''
since the Toronto-based company was not considered to be in such
precarious condition.
   Lonski said nervousness in the junk market was evident before
Campeau. Just prior to the crisis, the average difference in yields
between junk bonds and 10-year Treasury bonds _ considered among the
safest investments _ was 5.4 percentage points, or nearly 1.4
percentage points greater than the yield spread at the start of the
year.
   ``The overall junk bond market may not fully recover to where it
was at the start of this year until it has been put through the test
of a recession,'' Lonski said.
   Some experts are less pessimistic. James C. Goss, a high-yield
analyst at the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps Inc., said it's
not the first time the market has taken a hit but then recovered.
   ``It was an important event. But I don't know that it signaled
the end of the market,'' Goss said.
   Goss and other market-watchers said one outcome of Campeau's
troubles is that investors are going to demand that new junk issues
involve less leverage by the issuing companies and more realistic
plans about how the debt is going to be repaid.
   Many experts said Campeau paid too much for Allied Stores Corp.
and Federated Department Stores Inc., deals that led to its trouble,
and was forced to sell assets at prices below its expectations to
raise cash. The easy availability of money through selling junk
bonds doesn't lead to bargain hunting, they say.
   In addition, many analysts said, there's going to be more
awareness of the distinction between ``good'' junk and ``bad'' junk.
   Good junk bonds are issued by companies such as RJR Nabisco Inc.,
financially strong companies in industries that don't usually suffer
in recessions. Bad junk comes from weaker companies in cyclical
businesses.
   Finally, analysts said, more realism should be evident among the
investment houses that promote junk bonds and their clients that
issue them.
   ``You'll find that investment banks are going to scrutinize a lot
more closely these deals that they are putting together,'' said
Getman. ``They are getting stuck with unsold (junk) bonds for the
first time. In the past they passed these deals off on the public.
   ``I guess this is going to be one of the nice examples where Wall
Street is going to fleece itself as well as the public,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   About 300,000 California residents are
eligible for refunds of high-interest loans packed with expensive
extras under settlement of a lawsuit that could cost ITT Consumer
Financial Corp. up to $100 million.
   The company did not admit wrongdoing, but state Attorney General
John Van de Kamp said ITT's loan practices since 1986 amounted to
``consumer fraud on a grand scale.''
   Van de Kamp said the Minnesota-based company took advantage of
people ``in desperate need of money'' and charged them up to 35
percent interest on loans and unnecessary extras.
   ``Every person who lost money to ITT can recover every dime, plus
interest. There is no cap on total refund due to consumers,'' Van de
Kamp told reporters Thursday, when the settlement was reached in
Alameda County Superior Court.
   The settlement came on a civil complaint filed by Van de Kamp
that accused ITT of assorted deceptions, lies and bait-and-switch
tactics.
   Van de Kamp said ITT mailed millions of California residents
invitations to apply for ``guaranteed'' loans of $2,300, promising
the money was ``pre-approved with no security required and no credit
checks.''
   Applicants who took up ITT on the offer ``were immediately
subjected to full security checks. ... They were presented with
ready-to-sign loan agreements that pledged their household goods and
cars as security, often far in excess of the loans,'' Van de Kamp
said.
   Applicants ``were often signed up for life, disability, property
and vehicle insurance, insurance that they did not need and did not
know they were buying,'' he said.
   In a statement, ITT did not admit any misdeeds, but said the
practices alleged by the state ``without doubt were contraventions
to our procedures and not a pattern of behavior condoned by the
company.''
   Restitution could be as much as $100 million to 300,000 loan
holders, but the number of consumers who apply for refunds likely
will be closer to 100,000, Van de Kamp said. The lower number of
consumers would cost ITT $25 million to $50 million, with an
additional $10.5 million to be set aside in trust for people who are
located later.
   Loan holders are to be contacted by letter with an explanation of
how to apply for refunds.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the newsroom of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
editors, reporters and clerks left their desks and gathered around a
microphone to hear a talk from the chief.
   ``Our confidence is strong, our spirits are high, our adrenalin
is running and we've done this without steroids,'' said Joseph
Pulitzer, Jr., chairman of the Pulitzer Publishing Co. and grandson
of the founder of the Post-Dispatch.
   It was a pep talk for the journalism troops who are preparing to
begin the nation's newest newspaper war, a battle the newspaper
industry is watching closely.
   The confrontation starts Monday when the tabloid newcomer, the
St. Louis Sun, owned and edited by Ralph Ingersoll II, hits the
street.
   Ingersoll, whose Ingersoll Publications Co. owns a chain of 43
free weekly or bi-weekly newspapers with a circulation of 700,000 in
the suburbs of St. Louis, is trying to buck the trend of newspapers
closing up or merging because they can't attract enough readers or
advertising to make money.
   So far, the specter of competition has been good for the historic
Post-Dispatch, which will be 111 years old in December, said
Nicholas G. Penniman IV, the newspaper's publisher.
   The paid daily circulation of the newspaper has been steadily
increasing this summer, Penniman said. Compared with the same period
last year, daily circulation is up about 8,000 and Sunday
circulation has increased by about 15,000.
   ``Part of the increase is because of baseball, part of it is
because we are making aggressive attempts to sell the Post-Dispatch,
and thirdly, I think people appreciate the Post-Dispatch and enjoy
it,'' he said.
   Penniman said the Post-Dispatch now has a daily circulation of
about 380,000 and a Sunday circulation of about 565,000. The Sun
hopes to have at least 75,000 subscribers at the outset; it already
has signed up more than 50,000, said Robert M. Jelenic, president
and chief executive of the Sun.
   Penniman said that as far as the Post-Dispatch can tell, it has
lost only 50 subscribers to the Sun, and the amount spent on retail
advertising by the Post-Dispatch's 10 largest accounts is up about 5
percent from last year.
   Meanwhile, in the Post-Dispatch newsroom, ideas and ideals have
been flying.
   ``It's a little bit like an athletic competition,'' said David
Lipman, the managing editor. ``There's no question there's a sense
of anticipation and excitement about the competition.''
   He said the Sun has allowed editors to make changes that had been
proposed for at least a year, including increasing sports and
business coverage and adding a news summary.
   The Post-Dispatch also has redesigned several sections of the
paper and hired a full-time writing coach, longtime chief copy
editor Harry Levins.
   Lipman said the changes were not made to match the Sun, which has
touted itself as planning to be a colorful, easy-to-read ``laptop''
newspaper with extra emphasis on sports.
   ``We would have made these changes whether there was some new
competition or not,'' he said. `'We are going to continue putting
out an ever-improving newspaper no matter what distractions or
attractions come to St. Louis.''
   Expectations of St. Louis residents toward the two newspapers may
differ, according to Charles Klotzer, editor of the St. Louis
Journalism Review.
   `'I think the first questions that are asked about the Sun and
the Post-Dispatch depict immediately how the newspapers are viewed
in the community,'' Klotzer said.
   ``When we talk about the Sun, we ask, `Do you think it's going to
make a profit,' and when we talk about the Post-Dispatch, we ask,
`Do you think it's going to be a better newspaper.'''
   Penniman, speaking to a recent Missouri newspaper meeting, said
some people believe ``we'll be like the 800-pound gorilla and crush
the Sun.'' But he added that this would not be true.
   ``We don't want to be the only paper in St. Louis, we want to be
the best,'' he said.

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley today called
President Bush's plan to cut the capital gains tax ``a positive harm
to the economy'' and vowed to pass a Democratic alternative despite
a veto threat.
   Bush, meanwhile, denied his policies were designed to help the
rich and declared: ``This should not be a partisan issue.''
   ``I think we're doing very well'' in enlisting support for the
Democratic plan that would raise taxes for the richest 600,000
couples and individuals to pay for new tax deductions for Individual
Retirement Accounts, Foley told reporters. ``We have a pretty good
popular constituency.''
   A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll seemed to back that up,
showing that 49 percent of voters prefer expansion of IRAs, while 38
percent favor Bush's capital gains tax reduction idea. The poll
noted that the preference for IRAs was even greater among
middle-income voters: 53 percent to 35 percent.
   The Democrats' proposal also includes a scaled-down version of
the capital gains tax cut sought by Bush. Bush's version, Foley
said, ``is a positive harm to the economy, an inequitable tax
reduction favoring the least financially deserving of the income
groups in the country.''
   The president, interviewed live Thursday night on the ABC-TV
program ``Prime Time Live,'' was asked what he would do if Democrats
on Capitol Hill succeeded in passing their own tax bill.
   ``I will veto a rate increase,'' Bush said. ``You heard it for
the first time here, but I have sent that signal up to the Hill.''
   Responding to that, Foley said: ``Well, then, we'll try to send
it to him and let him veto it.''
   Bush also defended his proposal for a cut in the capital gains
rate, saying, ``It is not a tax break for the rich.'' The House Ways
and Means Committee approved a version of the president's plan.
   Taking questions from farm broadcasters today on an Agriculture
Department radio program, Bush said the capital gains tax cut he is
seeking ``would put money in the little guy's pocket.''
   ``I've heard some on the hill deride this as just another tax cut
for the rich, but that simply is not the case,'' Bush told his radio
audience.
   He claimed that under existing law, only one-third of
sole-proprietor farmers could qualify for a 100 percent exclusion
from the capital gains tax. Under his measure, he said, half would
qualify for this exclusion.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Thursday that
Democrats were ready to tackle the tax hike accusations.
   ``I like how the lines are drawn,'' Gephardt said. ``The Bush
proposal gives a tax break for the rich, paid for by the middle
class. Our proposal gives Individual Retirement Accounts to the
middle class paid for by the super-wealthy.''
   The Democratic proposal, which House leadership plans to bring
before the full House next week, would:
   _Eliminate restrictions passed in 1986 so that all workers,
regardless of income, could have a deductible IRA plan. The money
could be withdrawn before retirement without paying a penalty if
used to finance the down payment on a first home or for college
education.
   _Pay for the IRAs and reduce the deficit by raising taxes on the
nation's wealthiest 600,000 couples and individuals.
   Under current law, the tax rate for upper-middle-income Americans
is 33 percent, but it drops back to 28 percent for those at the
uppermost income levels. The Democrats would raise that top rate to
33 percent.
   For example, a single person with $75,000 taxable income now pays
a top rate of 33 percent on a $10,000 pay raise or investment
windfall. But a $250,000-a-year earner pays only 28 percent tax on a
similar increase in income.
   _Eliminate the 33 percent rate bracket for capital gains, so it
would never climb above 28 percent. That would be a tax break for
those upper-middle-income people who now pay 33 percent on capital
gains just as they do on earned income.
   The Democratic plan would be offered as an alternative to the
capital gains tax cut approved by the House Ways and Means Committee
with the president's support. That plan would cut the effective
capital gains rate to 19.6 percent for the next two years and then
protect such income from taxes caused by inflationary increases in
the property's value.

<HEAD>Let's Soak the Rich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trouble with Uncle Sam trying to soak the
rich is that even if he took every taxable nickel they earned, it
wouldn't be enough. He'd run through it in less than a couple of
weeks.
   It seems there just aren't enough rich people, no matter what
you've heard. They don't have enough money, either. And if you take
it all in one year, there'll probably be even fewer of them the next.
   Based on 1986 tax returns, 35,875 individuals had adjusted gross
income of more than $1 million. That might seem like a lot, but in a
relative sense it isn't _ just 0.03 percent of all taxpayers.
   Examining the data, the Tax Foundation, which describes itself as
a nonprofit research organization, determined that the group's
adjusted gross income was $82.3 billion, taxable income was $66.3
billion and tax owed totaled $33.7 billion.
   That taxable income was the result of an effective tax rate of 41
percent. Had the rate been 100 percent, it would have put another
$32.6 billion into Uncle Sam's pockets. It would have lasted him 12
days.
   There just aren't enough millionaires to accomplish what the
soak-the-rich folks desire. They must dig deeper for pay dirt. The
``rich'' category must be expanded to include those with taxable
income of $500,000 or more.
   Now we're talking, you say. But, no, we're really not.
   Based on the foundation's examination, 92,621 individual returns
showed taxable income of $500,000 or more in 1986. Had they been
taxed 100 percent, it would have provided an additional $53.7
billion, sufficient for 19.8 days.
   There just aren't enough half-millionaires either. The category
of ``rich'' must be expanded again, this time to include the ``well
off,'' or those with taxable income of $200,000 or more. Now we're
really talking.
   Really? In 1986 there were nearly 400,000 of them. Had they been
taxed 100 percent, the government would have been $88.4 billion
richer. Those are big bucks in any comparison, but Uncle Sam would
have run through them in a month.
   Efforts to dig deeper into the tax lode produces similarly
frustrating returns. To attempt doing it inevitably would have an
effect opposite to that intended. Take all a person's taxable
income, and the person will stop producing it.
   And, though they appear wealthy, some of these taxpayers probably
aren't. Some, for example, are ``rich'' just once in a lifetime _
when they sell the farm or the family business. Their wealth is the
result of years of work.
   To dig deeper is, eventually, to strike the middle classes _
upper and lower _ whence most of the revenues already come. They
have no more to give. Already, the buck has stopped at the middle
class.
   If the rich can't help then certainly the poor cannot either.
How, therefore, do you relieve the middle class of its burden?
   You probably cannot. America is a nation of middle-class
citizens; no other nation has produced more. A big middle class has
long been one of the nation's proudest boasts.
   It is the nation's strength, its symbol of accomplishment, its
proof of the system, its stability. It is also the nation's
taxpayer, and aside perhaps from a bottle of aspirin or some other
token, relief is not in sight.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Dip On Reduced Freeze Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting reduced fears of a crop-damaging freeze this weekend in
the Midwest.
   The steadying of the markets follows sharply higher corn and
soybean futures in the two previous sessions on forecasts for a hard
freeze in the Corn Belt this weekend and early next week.
   But this morning's forecasts showed less of a chance for
widespread frost and a return to normal temperatures next week.
   Wheat futures weakened in reaction to the International Wheat
Council's downward revision _ to 31 million metric tons from 36
million metric tons _ of estimated Soviet grain imports for the
current wheat marketing year, which runs from June through May.
   The revision follows Soviet statements that they plan fewer grain
imports.
   ``We could be looking at a decrease in demand while U.S.
production has increased sharply from a year ago, which would be a
negative scenario,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine
Corp.'s floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to } cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $3.94 a bushel; corn
was } cent lower to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.31 a bushel;
oats were } cent to 1\ cents higher with December at $1.42} a
bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 8 cents higher with November
at $5.82\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .18 cent higher with October
at 71.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .10
cent higher with September at 83 cents a pound; hogs were .18 cent
to .57 cent higher with October at 42.45 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .05 cent to .90 cent higher with February at 49.65
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

   Amway Corp. has agreed to pay $38.1 million to
settle charges it avoided paying Canadian duties, and in exchange
the government dropped a $125.4 million suit against the direct
sales company, an official said Friday.
   A spokesman for Revenue Minister Otto Jelinek said the government
filed notice to drop the suit Wednesday in the Federal Court of
Canada. Amway initiated negotiations to settle the case a year ago,
he added.
   ``It's not a bad settlement,'' said the spokesman, who asked not
to be identified.
   Amway officials at the company's headquarters in Ada, Mich., were
not immediately available for comment.
   Canada's revenue agency had accused the Amway of avoiding custom
duties by undervaluing merchandise it exported from the United
States to Canadian distributors during a six-year period beginning
in 1974.
   The 9-year-old lawsuit sought money for unpaid customs duties,
sales taxes and the value of the Amway products that crossed into
Canada during those six years.
   Amway officials had said they were confident that Revenue Canada
could not collect because the agency's lawyers failed to include
that claim in their original suit.
   In 1983, Amway pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to
fraud allegations and paid a $25 million fine to the Province of
Ontario.
   Amway is second to Avon Products Inc. in direct sales worldwide.

<HEAD>Mosbacher Suggests Debt Moratorium To Help Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western aid to Poland could include a
moratorium on interest payments of $26 billion in debt held by the
country's official creditors, U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher said Friday.
   ``I think we're going to see some help,'' Mosbacher told the
Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce. ``I think we'll probably end up
giving Poland a moratorium on interet payments.''
   Asked to clarify, he said: ``I'm speaking about the public debt.
I'm not dealing with the private debt, and I think under the right
conditions there could be some sort of moratorium.''
   Mosbacher, speaking after a trip including stops in Poland and
Hungary, said the moratorium idea was a personal view.
   But he added that the Bush administration has asked the World
Bank and other Western countries involved in fighting the debt
crisis to help find ways to ease Poland's $40 billion foreign debt,
of which $26 billion is in government-backed credits.
   Poland in 1988 ran up about $450 million in missed debt payments
and faces debt-servicing costs of about $4 billion this year.

   Stocks closed moderately lower in light trading
Friday amid an exodus of buyers before the Group of Seven meeting in
Washington this weekend.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
10.7 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,370.2, just above its session low
of 2,369.7, and well below the day's high of 2,382.1.
   Volume was a light 452.9 million shares, compared with 413.8
million shares Thursday.
   Besides concerns over potential action by the G-7, dealers said
limited action on Wall Street gave little direction to London.
   The G-7 nations are the United States, West Germany, Japan,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   The major feature of the session was Boots Co. PLC, the British
health-care retailer and pharmaceuticals concern, which fell 41
cents to $4.55 a share after the company said clinical trials of a
heart drug showed it was less successful than expected in treating
congestive heart failure.

<TEXT>
   Amway Corp. has agreed to pay the
Canadian government $38.1 million to settle a $125.4-million tax
fraud lawsuit filed 10 years ago, officials said Friday.
   ``It was done with the intent of saving a lot of time and expense
in these complex legal procedures,'' said Jean Ouimet, a spokesman
for Revenue Canada's Customs and Excise Division.
   The settlement, combined with a $21-million criminal fine paid by
Amway to the Province of Ontario in 1983, brings to $59 million the
amount the giant direct-sales company has paid to end its legal
troubles in Canada.
   Canada's revenue agency had accused Amway of avoiding custom
duties by undervaluing merchandise it exported from 1974-80 from the
United States to Canadian distributors.
   The lawsuit, which was dropped Wednesday, sought money for unpaid
customs duties, sales taxes and the value of the Amway products that
crossed into Canada during those six years.
   In 1982, Canada also brought criminal charges against Amway
co-founders Richard DeVos and Jay VanAndel and two other top
executives in connection with the case. Those charges were dropped
in 1983 after Amway pleaded guilty and paid the $21 million fine.
   Otto Stolz, Amway's general counsel, said the company is under a
gag order not to discuss the particulars of the settlement.
   Amway is second to Avon Products Inc. in direct sales worldwide.

   Jaguar PLC's board of directors on Friday
characterized Ford Motor Co.'s plans to buy a stake in the company
as an unwelcome initiative and vowed to preserve the British luxury
auto maker's independence.
   Ford announced Tuesday it intended to buy as much as 15 percent
of Jaguar's shares, the maximum allowed under current British
government restrictions.
   In its response, Jaguar said in a brief statement following a
board meeting that its directors ``confirmed that the Ford
initiative was unwelcome.''
   In addition, directors ``determined to continue to pursue plans
that would preserve Jaguar's independence, which they believe to be
in the best long-term interests of everyone associated with the
company.''
   A Jaguar spokesman declined to elaborate.
   Jaguar stock rose 52 cents a share to finish at $9.18 on London's
Stock Exchange. Takeover speculation has pushed Jaguar stock sharply
higher this week. On Monday, the day preceeding the Ford
announcement, Jaguar closed at just $6.40 a share.
   Ford said it sought long-term relationship with the unprofitable
British automaker. But Ford added that it was too early to say
whether it would seek to acquire Jaguar once the government's
restrictions on its ownership are lifted at the end of the year.
   Until the end of 1990, the maximum holding allowed in Jaguar is
15 percent and the government has the right to veto any takeover.
The government imposed those restrictions when it privatized Jaguar
in 1984.
   Ford characterized its approach as friendly. Jaguar said it was
notified of Ford's plans shortly before the U.S. automaker made the
announcement.
   There has been speculation that fellow U.S. car manufacturer
General Motors Corp., along with other auto makers, also were
interested in pursuing Jaguar.
   While Jaguar has held out the possibility of collaborating with
another car maker, a spokesman earlier in the week affirmed the
company's desire to remain independent.
   Jaguar has been battered by flagging sales in its principal U.S.
market during the past year. The company expects to sell 20,000 cars
in the United States this year, down from 20,700 in 1988.
   For the first six months of the year, Jaguar posted an after-tax
loss of $1.7 million on sales of $870 million.
   Analysts said Ford, which already has a huge European presence
and is negotiating a possible transaction with Swedish automaker
Saab, could benefit from an association with the well-known Jaguar
luxury car line.
   Ford of Europe, which is headquartered in Brentwood, England,
makes 1.8 million vehicles a year. It has 21 European plants, 11 of
them in Britain, and employs more than 110,000 people.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner today
told the new owners of Northwest Airlines his decision on his review
of the $4 billion takeover of NWA Inc., a department spokesman said.
But an announcement was not due until next week.
   Skinner has the option of pulling the airline's operating
license, but there has been no indication that is likely.
   Transportation Department spokesman Hal Paris said a decision has
been made in the department's review of the takeover by Wings
Holdings Ltd. of NWA, Northwest's parent company. He said Skinner
met this morning with California investor Alfred Checchi, who heads
Wings.
   Paris said results of the department's fitness review of the $4
billion takeover would likely be made public next week.
   He said the department's public affairs office had been given no
details of the meeting but Skinner would have told Checchi whether
any restrictions might be put on the airline's operating license
because of the buyout.
   Paris, said conditions could include requiring the airline to
furnish regular financial reports and putting restrictions on the
carrier's management.
   Skinner informed Checchi of his decision before making it public
because he ``didn't want Mr. Checchi reading about (the findings) in
the paper,'' the spokesman said.
   Checchi led a group including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines that
agreed in June to pay $121 a share for NWA. Northwest is the
nation's fourth-largest airline.
   Skinner has expressed concern about leverage buyouts and
increasing foreign investment in U.S. airlines. The Checchi takeover
saddles Northwest with $3.1 billion in debt.
   Without mentioning Northwest, Skinner said in a speech to the
International Aviation Club Tuesday that he would make adjustments
in a heavily leveraged airline's operating certificate if necessary
to protect the public interest.
   ``Or, if absolutely necessary,'' he added, ``and I hope that
doesn't take place, we will revoke the certificate.''
   The Justice Department also investigated the Northwest sale but
did not raise any objections, said spokeswoman Amy Brown.
   The department's review was prompted by antitrust issues raised
by KLM's interest in the sale, Brown said.

   The stock market struggled to a small gain today,
still stuck in the neutral pattern of the past several sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.28 to 2,682.56
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 694 up, 671 down and 558
unchanged.
   Analysts said nothing had occurred to stir the market out of its
recent torpor.
   The rally that carried prices to record highs just before the
Labor Day weekend crested as it became evident that interest rates
had stopped falling.
   That left investors in something of a stalemate between those who
expect persistent economic growth at a moderate pace and those who
still believe a significant slowdown awaits in the not-too-distant
future.
   J.P. Morgan climbed 1~ to 41|. Late Thursday the company
increased by $2 billion its reserves against problem loans to
lesser-developed countries.
   Procter &amp; Gamble dropped 2[ to 119}, while Noxell Corp. jumped 10
to 31\ in the over-the-counter market. P&amp;G agreed to acquire Noxell
through an exchange of stock.
   Cummins Engine tumbled 3| to 59. The company said it expects to
post a substantial loss for the third quarter, largely because of
reduced demand for its products.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.51 to 192.67. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .72 at 380.76.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 112.39 million shares with an

   Soybean futures prices fell steeply Friday,
leading the grain markets lower amid receding fears of a hard frost
in the Midwest this weekend.
   The buying erased the gains made in the previous sesssion, when
soybeans led a strong rally linked to forecasts for a near-record
cold snap in crop-growing areas still vulnerable to frost damage.
   But many meteorologists altered their outlooks on Friday.
   ``Most of the forecasts now are minimizing the chance for frost
this weekend,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine
Corp.'s floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   ``They're talking about minimal frost in isolated areas with the
potential for a return to normal temperatures next week,'' he said.

<HEAD>OPEC Oil Ministers Gather for Talks on Raising Output Ceiling</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subroto cq as full name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers, gathering for weekend talks on the
oil market, appeared at odds Friday over whether to lift their
production ceiling in the final three months of the year.
   Even before the start of discussions scheduled for late Saturday,
some ministers arriving in Geneva expressed concern over what they
consider to be weak crude prices. Eight ministers comprising the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' price monitoring and
long-term strategy committee are scheduled to meet.
   An increase in OPEC production, which some believe the ministers
might authorize, would likely cause prices to slip, analysts say.
   ``There's no need to raise the ceiling as long as the price
objective is not met,'' said Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena.
   But Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil chief, said, ``I
would like to see a reasonable increase in the ceiling.'' He didn't
specify a level.
   However, observers as well as some OPEC ministers have said they
don't expect a resolution to the volatile issue of permanent quotas
at this latest meeting. Instead, it appeared the quota issue would
be bumped to November, when the full cartel is to meet in Vienna.
   ``We can always discuss it, but there will not be a decision in
this area,'' said Boussena.
   The 13-nation cartel is pumping about 22 million barrels a day,
according to various estimates, well over the output cap of 19.5
million barrels set by OPEC for the last six months of the year.
   The ministers agreed in June to meet this month to decide whether
to lift the ceiling 500,000 barrels a day to 20 million barrels, or
perhaps more.
   Although world oil prices are weaker than they were last spring
and remain below the catel's benchmark of $18 a barrel, strong
demand has kept them surprisingly firm despite OPEC's excess
production.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto has estimated that demand for the
cartel's oil might be around 22 million barrels a day in the
October-December quarter.
   A basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC averaged $17.04 a
barrel last week. It had topped the $18-mark last spring.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of American oil, has
been trading in the range of $19.50 to $20 a 42-gallon barrel.
   Chalabi, arriving in mid-afternoon from an energy conference in
Montreal, told reporters that the OPEC ministers would review
conditions in the constantly changing oil market.
   He said some countries were opposed to an output increase because
``they want to defend the price.'' Others, he said, think ``supply
and demand warrant a much higher ceiling.''
   Boussena said there was a ``link'' between the cartel's
production level and its price, and he noted that prices had not
reached OPEC's benchmark in the last three months.
   Ecuador's Diego Tamariz also seemed worried about prices.
   ``We still have to obtain the goal of $18,'' he said, adding that
``we should work on it.''
   Fergus MacLeod, an analyst at the investment firm of Barclays de
Zoete Wedd in London, said prices would likely fall 50 cents or a
dollar a barrel if the cartel were to lift the supply cap without
curtailing members' cheating.
   An increase of 500,000 barrels a day, he said, would probably
kick up total output to about 22.5 million barrels.
   The ministers were also expected to begin tackling the tough
issue of how to meet some members' demands for a higher share of the
production pie. Each country is given a quota, or a daily production
level.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have in recent months ignored
their quotas and pumped as much as double their shares' of about a
million barrels each, analysts' estimate.
   Kuwait's oil minister, Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, said his promise at
the June meeting to hold the line on production was conditional.
   ``If everybody sticks to the quota, fine. If anybody breaks it,
the others have the same right,'' he told reporters outside the
luxury hotel where the ministers' will hold their discussions.
   The talks will technically be held by a monitoring panel of
ministers from Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria,
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The others - Gabon, Ecuador, Libya,
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - were also invited to attend.
   Saudia Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, was reported
recovering from surgery in the United States and was not attending.

<HEAD>Chrysler Selling Nearly Half Its Mitsubishi Holdings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said Friday it is selling about
half its stock in the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and
will receive about $310 million after taxes.
   An analyst said the move indicates the No. 3 American automaker,
which is in the midst of a $1 billion cost-cutting program, is being
cautious about the future of the U.S. auto market.
   Chrysler said the sale of Mitsubishi stock will drop its holdings
in its Japanese partner to 12.1 percent from 21.8 percent. A group
of 25 Japanese financial institutions is buying the stock for about
$592 million, Chrysler said.
   Chrysler, which owns an assembly plant with Mitsubishi in
Illinois, said the stock sale was not directly connected with the
automaker's financial trimming.
   ``The fact is, we didn't need (the $310 million) to meet the
short-term cash needs of implementing our billion-dollar cutting
program,'' Chrysler Chief Financial Officer Robert Miller said.
   He said Chrysler was not making much money on the Mitsubishi
stock investment, and selling 45 percent of its shares would help
boost the U.S. company's cash reserves.
   But analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New
York said the sale was an ``indicator of Chrysler's overall caution
on the outlook for the business in the United States.''
   ``It was not producing a cash return and now that they own half
of what they owned before in Mitsubishi, they still will have the
same business relationship and will be able to take a good bit of
cash out,'' he said.
   Miller said the deal would not affect the cooperation between the
two companies.
   ``By selling, we don't think the party's over by any means,''
Miller said.
   Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc., the Japanese company's
U.S. marketing arm in Cypress, Calif., had no comment on Chrysler's
move, spokesman Kim Custer said.
   Chrysler and Mitsubishi are involved in the joint manufacturing
venture Diamond-Star Motors Corp. in Normal, Ill., where Plymouth
Laser, Mitsubishi Eclipse and Eagle Talon are manufactured.
Mitsubishi also supplies more than 500,000 V-6 engines to Chrysler
annually.
   In 1971, Chrysler bought into Mitsubishi, at the time a privately
held company.
   Since then, Chrysler has been on a financial roller coaster. The
U.S. government guaranteed loans during the late 1970s that Chrysler
eventually paid off seven years early.
   Chrysler announced July 27 that it would slash $1 billion from
its $26 billion annual budget by the end of 1990.
   Chrysler Motors Corp. Chairman Ben Bidwell, head of the company's
vehicle-making arm, blamed the cuts on a slumping sales market;
rising costs, especially in consumer incentives; and forecasts of a
softer economy.
   Earlier this week, Chrysler Motors President Bob Lutz said the
company expected total U.S. car sales of 14.2 million vehicles in
1990, 4 percent to 5 percent below this year and 10.1 percent below
1988, the second-best year in auto history.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the time Tom Monaghan made it official,
Domino's Pizza Inc. employees already knew pizza no longer was the
founder's reason for being.
   Monaghan, 52, rich beyond his dreams, is at a crossroads.
   Church, charitable work and other outside interests are more
important than pepperoni, double mozzarella and guaranteed delivery
in 30 minutes or less.
   ``It is not fair to give divided attention to Domino's Pizza and
my foundation work,'' he said.
   His personal activities _ including work against abortion and
speaking in favor of the Contras in Nicaragua _ also attract
attention to the company he nurtured for 29 years.
   What he had hinted before, he told employees and franchise
holders in a letter earlier this month. Monaghan would consider
selling the company and other personal properties, such as his
antique cars _ an $8.1 million Bugatti among them _ for the right
price. He's keeping the Detroit Tigers baseball team, which he
bought for $55 million in 1983.
   The letter generated a flurry of publicity about the possible
sale _ front-page stories in Detroit's newspapers for several days.
Last week Monaghan stopped talking, and the focus turned to choosng
an investment banker to handle the sale. The low-end estimate of its
worth is $250 million; the high end is $1 billion.
   Monaghan had talked about selling before. In June, he named David
Black, vice president of operations since 1981, as president and
chief operating officer, giving Black most day-to-day
responsibilities while Monaghan retained the posts of chairman and
chief executive officer.
   ``I love the day-to-day work at Domino's, but I want to serve the
church more. I always wanted to be a priest,'' he told thousands of
employees at that time via closed-circuit television.
   And, he said then he would consider selling the company if it
would benefit his Domino's Pizza Foundation.
   Monaghan said in a July 1988 interview that pizza wasn't his
first priority even when he started Domino's in 1960 by trading a
car for a controlling interest in a pizza store in Ypsilanti, Mich.,
west of Detroit. His real goal, he said, was an architect career.
   Domino's has grown into the nation's second-largest pizza chain
with 5,100 stores in 17 countries and estimated annual sales of $2.1
billion, figures from the National Association of Pizza Operators
show. Pizza Hut is No. 1 with 7,000 restaurants and estimated annual
sales of $3.2 billion.
   Monaghan has become one of the nation's wealthiest people, using
that money to pursue youthful interests. Forbes Magazine estimated
his net worth last year at $480 million.
   Architecture books line his office shelves and he owns a
collection of furniture designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, including a
$198,000 chair, a $264,000 dresser and a dining room set purchased
for $1.6 million in 1987.
   Monaghan's collection of classic automobiles numbers about 300,
including the 1931 Bugatti Royale Berline de Voyage bought in 1986
for $8.1 million and a 1942 Buick Roadmaster convertible that is his
favorite to drive.
   In 1985, he began construction on the 300-acre, $250 million
Domino's Farms headquarters complex in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   The company also has a resort on Drummond Island in Michigan's
Upper Peninsula where employees and other guests are housed in a
Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired lodge and entertained on the 173-foot
schooner Domino Effect.
   Monaghan has pursued Roman Catholic church work with equal zeal.
As a foster child, he attended a Catholic school in Traverse City,
and for a time he attended a seminary school in Grand Rapids until
kicked out in 10th grade for misbehaving.
   Now his Domino's Foundation supports a Catholic missionary priest
in Honduras, and Monaghan twice has met Pope John Paul II.
   He founded Legatus, an international organization for Catholic
corporate chief executives that schedules events from dinners with
Mass and a speaker to workshops on business ethics. He said last
year, ``It's the thing that I feel best about of anything I do.''
   Monaghan's conservative Catholic activities have had
repercussions. The National Organization for Women supports a
Domino's boycott because of his financial support for anti-abortion
causes.
   Company spokesman Ron Hingst says the protests don't hurt sales.
Rockwell wouldn't speculate on their impact, though he said outside
activities can distract a chief executive.
   ``It's certainly possible an individual can spend too much time
away from a company,'' he said.
   The pizza business itself has attackers, too. Domino's attorneys
are contending with damage suits by traffic accident victims who
blame pizza drivers hurrying to meet Domino's 30-minute delivery
deadline to avoid giving a $3 discount on the pizza they are
carrying.
   Security is another problem. Carrying money and pizza can make
drivers robbery targets. One driver was killed in 1987 in a
confrontation with gang members in San Bernardino, Calif.
   Monaghan told The Detroit News the sale announcement was based
strictly on personal reasons.
   ``I've got just about everything I've ever dreamed about,'' he
said, ``and the great lesson of that is it's not that big a deal.''

<HEAD>Maxwell Reports Several Inquiries To Buy Maxwell Graphics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC said Friday that
it has received ``a number of inquiries'' regarding its previously
disclosed plans to sell its Maxwell Graphics business, the second
largest commercial printer in the United States.
   Chairman Robert Maxwell said it has retained the investment
banking firm Wertheim, Schroder &amp; Co. Inc. to act as its exclusive
financial adviser in the sale.
   Maxwell Graphics, which is based in Minneapolis, consists of four
printing companies Maxwell acquired over the past four years at a
cost of more than $500 million. It has 15 plants employing 4,500
people throughout the country.
   But the parent company, one of the world's largest media
concerns, has shifted its strategic focus away from printing and
toward publishing.
   In the past year, Maxwell has purchased the publishing and
information services giant Macmillan Inc. for $2.5 billion and the
Official Airlines Guide for $750 million. Earlier this week, it
agreed to buy the textbook concern Merrill Publishing from Bell &amp;
Howell Co. for $260 million in cash.
   Earlier this year, Maxwell sold its commercial and newspaper
printing operations in Great Britain, where the parent company is
based, and said it intended to sell its U.S. printing business by
March 1990.
   Maxwell spokesman David Adler said the U.S. printing operation
had about about $750 million in gross revenue last year and was
second only to R.R. Donnelly &amp; Sons Co. of Chicago.
   Maxwell Graphics prints Parade magazine, which is a supplement to
many Sunday newspapers in the United States, and some of the
editions of several Time Inc. Magazines Co.

   A group of Thomson McKinnon Inc. employees filed
a $100 million lawsuit Friday claiming that executives of the Wall
Street brokerage bankrupted an employee trust fund and used company
assets to pay for apartments and a yacht.
   The federal suit also alleges that a deal to sell struggling
Thomson McKinnon this year fell through after buyer Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. discovered the brokerage was overvalued by $80
million to $95 million.
   After the deal collapsed, Prudential-Bache in July purchased only
Thomson McKinnon's retail brokerage offices and customer accounts.
   The company denied the allegations in the lawsuit, filed by 16
current and former Thomson McKinnon employees in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan as a class action on behalf of an estimated 2,800
employees who owned stock in the firm, which traces its formation to
1885.
   The lawsuit claims Thomson McKinnon executives used assets in an
employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, in ``a well planned and
executed scheme to personally profit at the expense of'' the firm,
its subsidiaries and the ESOP.
   Thomson McKinnon allegedly kept apartments in Puerto Rico and
Manhattan for senior officers; bought and maintained a $1.3 million
yacht for the company's president; gave executives disguised weekly
cash payments for personal use; and paid school tuition for former
chairman John J. Maloney Jr.'s 13 children.
   The lawsuit alleges broad financial mismanagement, including a
$125 million loan to a real estate investment trust that went
bankrupt and a costly decision to move the company's offices shortly
after the 1987 stock market crash.
   The firm also regularly overstated the company's earnings and
assets to induce employees to buy into the ESOP, the lawsuit claims.
The financial mismanagement, it alleges, led to the collapsed deal
with Prudential-Bache.
   Donald G. McCabe, general counsel for Thomson McKinnon Securities
Inc., the firm's brokerage arm, said the defendants ``will most
firmly deny the allegations'' and that the lawsuit is ``without
merit.''
   He declined immediate comment on specific allegations in the suit.
   The lawsuit says employees held about 77 percent of the stock in
stock in Thomson McKinnon as part of their regular compensation and
the ESOP was worth about $140 million in 1986.
   A year later it was estimated at $125 million, the plaintiffs
claim, but on July 31 this year the employees received a letter from
Thomson McKinnon Chairman J. Ronald Morgan stating that ``it is
possible (the ESOP) will have no value whatsoever.''
   The letter, distributed after the deal for the brokerage
division, also stated the ESOP would be canceled because the sale of
the full company to Prudential-Bache had fallen through.
   The lawsuit claims employees would have received the cash
equivalent of the stock following a sale, but lost that money when
the deal fell through because of the alleged mismanagement.
   The suit seeks more than $100 million in damages, or the amount
in the ESOP allegedly dissipated by executive mismanagement.
   In addition to Thomson McKinnon, Morgan and Maloney, the lawsuit
names company chairman Philip M. Fahey, six other senior executives
and the accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand.

   The stock market recorded a small gain today,
still stuck in the neutral pattern of the past several sessions.
   Trading was quiet.
   Analysts said nothing had occurred to stir the market out of its
recent torpor.
   The rally that carried prices to record highs just before the
Labor Day weekend crested as it became evident that interest rates
had stopped falling.
   That left investors in something of a stalemate between those who
expect persistent economic growth at a moderate pace and those who
still believe a significant slowdown awaits in the not-too-distant
future.

<TEXT>
   Executives at retailer R.H. Macy &amp; Co. made a
smart move this past week while their Campeau Corp. counterparts
scrambled to come up with cash to keep their department stores
running.
   They publicly reassured backers who had put money into Macy's
debt-financed buyout in 1986 that their investment was doing just
fine.
   Instead of ignoring the situation, Macy's tried to deflect the
shock waves rippling through the retail industry since Campeau
dropped a bombshell in disclosing a severe cash shortage.
   Big problems like Campeau's and nagging small ones that won't go
away have shaken the foundations under retailing and raised
questions about what it takes to thrive _ or even survive _ in a
business where so much rests on having the financial flexibility to
respond quickly to what customers want.
   Campeau, a Toronto-based retailing and real-estate company built
by an ambitious Robert Campeau, staved off an emergency last week
thanks to a money transfusion from a major stockholder.
   Obtaining the $250 million loan caused Campeau to lose control of
the company he founded and yield to others who might unwind the
strings of chain stores Campeau collected with heaps of borrowed
money.
   Campeau is trying to sell Bloomingdale's, its flagship property.
The company's properties alos include Burdines, Jordan Marsh,
Lazarus and Stern's.
   Even before Campeau's problems there were signs that things
weren't right in retailing.
   Australian-owned L.J. Hooker Corp., the owner of old-line
department stores B. Altman &amp; Co. and Bonwit Teller, sought refuge
in bankruptcy court after also running into trouble trying to stay
on top of a mountain of debt.
   The nightmares of Campeau and Hooker, heavily involved in
property development like Campeau, shows what can happen when
companies try to mix merchandise retailing with other businesses,
says Richard Echikson, chairman of Millburn, N.J.-based Retail
Consultants Inc.
   An exception is Crown American Corp., one of the country's major
shopping mall developers, which has had a happy experience as a
store owner. Since buying Hess's Department Stores of Allentown,
Pa., in 1979, Crown American has successfully expanded the chain to
72 stores from 17.
   Frank Pasquerilla, founder and currently chairman of Crown
American, has been praised for keeping people with retail-smarts in
charge at Hess's.
   ``Pasquerilla was smart enough to leave the merchant alone,''
says Echikson.
   Even retail titan Sears, Roebuck and Co. has been looking
vulnerable. It still could lose its No.1 ranking despite an
aggressive campaign to meet its discounting competitors head-on with
a low-pricing policy of its own.
   So far, Sears only seems to have spurred a price-cutting battle
that, while making bargain hunters happy, could have unpleasant
consequences for retailers who cut their profit margins to the bone
to maintain market share.
   Stephanie Shern of the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young says Sears
hasn't emphasized rapid response in distribution, unlike
fast-growing Wal-Mart Stores Inc., with its high-tech,
satellite-controlled communications system, or Toys R Us Inc., where
poor-selling games or gizmos aren't allowed to linger.
   ``The guys who understand how to buy that product and get it on
the shelves quickly without a lot of warehousing costs will do
best,'' Shern said.
   At No.2-ranked K mart Corp., the cardinal rule in retailing,
``Know your customer,'' seems to be getting confused.
   The discounter has forged unlikely alliances with
actress-cum-clothing-designer Jacqueline Smith, hostess
extraordinaire Martha Stewart and other luminaries to spruce up its
dowdy image. The risk? Alienating its traditional customers who are
thinking about price, not prestige.
   Retailers catering to specialized groups, such as
fashion-conscious women, seem to be doing well these days. Analysts
expect these niche merchants to continue flourishing if they're
willing to adapt, such as changing their presentation to suit a
maturing population of women shoppers.
   Specialty apparel retailer Limited Inc. seems to be doing just
that. Its flagship Limited stores have subtly changed the looks of
its merchandise while the kookier stuff for teeny-boppers is now
found in Limited Express shops.
   Old-fashioned courtesy is back in fashion among retailers.
Nordstrom Inc. seems to be prospering as it expands outside its
historic Western area by investing in polite employees who are
winning raves from patrons.
   What's going on in retailing is typical for a mature industry;
the solution to slow growth isn't as simple anymore as building
another store, says Shern, adding stores must come up with ways to
make themselves distinctive.
   Making matters more difficult for sellers is that buyers may be
losing interest in shopping. The go-go days are long gone for the
current economic cycle and people are busy enjoying possessions they
already own. Pent-up demand has been satisfied.
   Plus, grownup baby boomers with new families have decided it's
finally time to start saving up for junior's college education.
   ``There is greater restraint. Impulse and frivolous purchases are
way down,'' says Kurt Barnard, a New York-based retail consultant
and publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report.
   In such an environment it's no wonder that Robert Campeau's dream
of a continent-spanning retail empire couldn't become a reality. But
Campeau's downfall wasn't just the outcome of a poor business
environment.
   With the benefit of hindsight, analysts say Campeau paid too much
when he laid out $6.6 billion for Federated Department Stores Inc.
in 1988 after spending $3.6 billion to get Allied Stores Corp. two
years earlier.
   Campeau misjudged retail sales prospects and made unrealistic
assumptions about cash flow at Federated and Allied, analysts say.
   Robert Campeau, having demonstrated a knack for property
development, apparently thought that if he excelled at building
stores he knew about what went on inside them.
   By contrast, Macy's, seems to be balancing its financial and
merchandising interests better, but of course only time will tell
whether it's making the right decisions.

<HEAD>Judge Says Public Service Can Seek Federal Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ADOLPHE V. BERNOTAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Yacos ruled
Friday that Public Service Co. of New Hampshire can reorganize under
federal law which means the company can bypass state regulators in
setting electricity rates in its reorganization.
   The decision was issued from the bench. Yacos said he would have
a formal ruling next month.
   Under state law, Public Service cannot charge ratepayers for the
Seabrook nuclear power plant until it operates commercially. The
idle plant has been finished for three years but lacks a full-power
commercial operating license. Public Service was forced into U.S.
Bankruptcy Court 20 months ago under the financial stress of its
lead share in the $6.2 billion plant.
   Under federal regulations, the company could seek wholesale rate
regulation, bypassing state control.
   Nicholas Ashooh, a spokesman for the utility, said however that
Public Service has no intention of seeking federal regulation.
   ``We plan to continue to talk with the state to achieve a
mutually agreeable resolution,'' he said.
   Martin Gross, the utility's lawyer, stressed that Public Service
will try to reach an agreement with the state ``with state
regulation.''
   Larry Smukler, the state's chief negotiator, said the decision
``is adverse to us, to the public interest of New Hampshire.''
   He said the state will appeal the decision, adding that ``the
state of New Hampshire will not let this (federal regulation)
happen.''
   He said the state's ``last resort will be to acquire the company
voluntarily or involuntarily'' under the state's recently enacted
power authority legislation.
   The decision is seen as giving the utility leverage in its
negotiations with the state to set rates in the reorganized company.
   Yacos and parties to the bankruptcy were in federal bankruptcy
court to discuss the plans filed for reorganizing Public Service.
   Yacos reassured critics from Public Service's unsecured
creditors' committee, who say New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg is
manipulating the value of the utility for political reasons.
   In papers filed this past week with the court, the creditors'
committee asked Yacos to reassert strong control over the case.
   The governor has given his endorsement to a buyout offer from New
England Electric System of Westborough, Mass. The endorsement
superseded his earlier approval of an offer from Northeast Utilities
of Berlin, Conn.
   United Illuminating of New Haven, Conn., also seeks to merge with
the troubled utility.
   Yacos will hold hearings on the proposals through mid-November,
when shareholders and creditors will vote. If they choose one, Yacos
likely will abide by their choice. If they choose two, he could pick
one, or find another solution.
   Public Service believes it is the frontrunner because its
reorganization plan has the creditors' and shareholders' approval.
   The other plans do not. The other utilities would have to reach
such agreement and get approval from the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Public Service needs only state regulatory approval.
   But New England Electric's plan has Gregg's endorsement because
it had the lowest rate projections. The state, however, has no vote
in bankruptcy court, although Yacos could consider the state's
wishes.
   Public Service, with almost 400,000 customers, filed for
bankruptcy protection from creditors under the burden of its largest
36 percent share of Seabrook.
   United Illuminating's 17.5 percent is the second-largest share of
Seabrook. NEES and Northeast own smaller shares.

   Allegheny International Inc.'s plan to emerge
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization has developed another
hitch.
   Its latest plan, the sixth it has filed in 19 months, is being
rewritten because senior bondholders and certain lenders insist on
being repaid in cash rather than high-risk junk bonds.
   That will force changes in other major parts of the plan,
although the amount of distributions to creditors and shareholders
probably will not change, said Allegheny attorney Bruce McCullough.
   Among the changes may be a revision in how the reorganized
company, a former conglomerate now best known for making Sunbeam and
Oster appliances, will pay retirees' pensions and health benefits.
   The company previously had proposed paying benefits from a fund
to be financed by selling such non-core assets as real estate and
its half-interest in Titanium Metals Corp. of America. That proposal
may be scrapped, McCullough said.
   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the government agency that
insures pensions, has objected to that arrangement as too uncertain.
   Robert Sable, an attorney for bondholders and other unsecured
creditors, said at a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court Thursday that
a revised plan could be ready in 20 or 30 days.

<HEAD>French Tiremaker To Buy Uniroyal in $1.5 Billion Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Michelin Group of France announced Friday
it will acquire Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. in a deal valued at $1.5
billion, forming the largest tire-maker in the world.
   Michelin will pay $690 million for Uniroyal Goodrich and assume
$810 million in debt, company officials said.
   ``We are confident that Michelin's additional financial and
technological resources will make an important contribution to the
Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.'s future,'' Uniroyal Goodrich Chairman B.
Charles Ames said.
   Ames also is a principal in the New York investment firm Clayton
&amp; Dubilier Inc., which acquired Uniroyal Inc. in 1985 to help it
thwart a hostile takeover by Carl C. Icahn.
   Uniroyal Goodrich will operate as a subsidiary of the Michelin
Group and will keep its headquarters in Akron. The company will
continue to make and distribute Uniroyal, BFGoodrich and other
brands of tires while retaining its corporate identity, Michelin
spokesman Jim Morton said.
   Michelin, based in Clermon-Terrand, France, was locked in a
three-way contest with Akron-based Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. and
Bridgestone of Japan to be the world's largest tire company.
   But Michelin would become the largest if regulators in the United
States and Canada approve the deal, said Saul Ludwig, a tire analyst
with Cleveland-based Raulston &amp; Co.
   The Michelin Group reported 1988 sales of $8.7 billion. Uniroyal
Goodrich had sales of $2.2 billion in 1988, for a total of $10.9
billion. Goodyear had sales of $10.8 billion in 1988.
   ``We expect to see positive results both short-term and
long-term, when Michelin's technology and research are added to our
own capabilities,'' said Sheldon R. Salzman, Uniroyal Goodrich
president and chief operating officer.
   ``This transaction will mean continued job security for our
employees and a stronger Uniroyal Goodrich in the future,'' he said.
   Clayton &amp; Dubilier took Uniroyal private in a management-led $950
million buyout. Martin H. Dubilier, chairman of Clayton &amp; Dubilier,
said the company knew a partner would be needed.
   ``Michelin approached us,'' Dubilier said. ``They have the
resources to make us more competitive.''
   Dubilier estimated Uniroyal Goodrich will need to spend $600
million in the next five years to remain competitive in the tire
business.
   Uniroyal Goodrich became the second-largest tire manufacturer in
North America and fifth-largest worldwide when B.F. Goodrich Co. and
Uniroyal Inc. of Middlebury, Conn., merged their tire operations in
August 1986.
   Michelin Group operates Michelin Tire Corp., headquartered in
Greenville, S.C., with four tire manufacturing plants in South
Carolina and plants in Alabama and North Carolina, employing about
12,000 people.
   Michelin Tires Ltd, a subsidiary of Michelin Group, operates
three tire manufacturing facilities in Nova Scotia and employs 4,000
people in Canada.
   Uniroyal Goodrich employs 18,500 in its tire, textile and
synthetic rubber businesses. The company operates tire factories in
Ardmore, Okla.; Eau Claire, Wis., Fort Wayne, Ind.; Opelika, Ala.;
and Tuscaloosa, Ala. The company also operates two factories in
Kitchener, Ontario, and two in Mexico.
   Michelin said Uniroyal Goodrich will continue to have its own
board of directors and retain its corporate identity.

   The stock market closed out a listless week with
a small gain in light trading Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.33 to 2,681.61,
finishing the week with a net gain of 7.03 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
747 up, 654 down and 562 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 133.35 million

   That left investors in something of a stalemate between those who

   In addition, it helped conjecture to spread that stocks might be
due for a lengthy pause, or a ``correction,'' after their sharp rise
over the first eight months of the year.
   J.P. Morgan led the active list and climbed 2 to 41} on volume of
more than 1.78 million shares. Late Thursday the company increased

countries.
   Procter &amp; Gamble dropped 2 to 119~, while Noxell Corp. jumped 10

<HEAD>UAL Chairman Would Make Millions on Buyout Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. Chairman Stephen M. Wolf stands to
make more than $76 million on stock and options in a proposed
leveraged buyout of the parent of United Airlines, it was disclosed
Friday.
   Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
revealed that if the $9.45 billion tender offer by a
pilot-management group is consummated, Wolf will get $22.5 million
for his 75,000 shares and $54.17 million for his options to buy
another 250,000 shares.
   Wolf, the former Republic Airlines executive who was tapped to
run Chicago-based UAL in 1987, wasn't the only corporate official
who stands to make a huge profit on the long-negotiated buyout.
   If the $300-a-share deal goes through, John C. Pope, UAL's chief
financial officer, stands to make $3 million on his 10,000 shares
and $34.65 million for his options.
   Wolf and Pope would continue to run the company under the buyout
plan, which calls for UAL workers to own 75 percent of the company.
A management group headed by Wolf would own 10 percent and the
remaining 15 percent would be held by British Airways PLC.
   Other details of the plan were revealed in the massive SEC
documents, filed just before closing time Thursday and made public
Friday.
   Just a week before the pilot-management agreement was reached,
union leaders representing United pilots and flight attendants met
for an hour on Sept. 8 with representatives of Robert M. Bass Group
Inc. ``to discuss whether there might be a basis for considering a
joint pilot-Bass Group bid for (UAL),'' according to the filing.
   But ``the pilots reaffirmed their satisfaction with the joint
pilot-management bid'' and ``determined to proceed with that bid.''
   Bass, a billionaire Texas investor, has been mentioned previously
in speculation about a UAL takeover.
   United's largest union, the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, has opposed the buyout.
   In addition to contacts with the pilots and flight attendants,
Bass has sought meetings with the Machinists to discuss whether they
would be interested in supporting his bid, according to the
Machinists.
   The documents also disclosed that while investor Marvin Davis was
trying to acquire UAL for as much as $275 a share, UAL's financial
adviser First Boston Corp. also was in contact with an unidentified
third party ``that had previously indicated an interest in making a
proposal to acquire'' UAL.

   The dollar rose Friday in thin, erratic trading
in advance of a meeting Saturday between finance ministers of the
Group of Seven industrialized nations. Gold prices also rose.
   The Federal Reserve sold dollars for a fourth straight day,
dealers said, but the currency bounced back from the intervention
and ended near the highs of the session.
   Dealers said the dollar rose in spite of some speculation that
the finance ministers would plan more serious steps at their
Washington meeting to push down the dollar to help shrink the U.S.
trade deficit.
   The Group of Seven is the United States, Britain, Japan, West
Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
   Most traders went home Friday without any positions for or
against the dollar because of uncertainty about what the meeting
would produce, said Kevin Lawrie, senior foreign-exchange manager at
Bank of Boston in New York.
   ``We're approaching this next situation very tentatively. People
have been whipsawed,'' he said.
   The market showed little reaction to a Commerce Department report
that consumer spending rose 0.9 percent and personal income rose 0.4
percent in August. The report pointed toward continued economic
expansion.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.00 Japanese yen, unchanged
from Thursday. In London late Friday the dollar traded higher at
145.35 yen. At the end of the day in New York the dollar rose to
146.05 yen from 145.65 on Thursday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5755 late Friday, cheaper
for buyers than Thursday's late $1.5805. In New York the pound fell
against the dollar to $1.5715 from $1.5790.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates, included: 1.9530 West German marks, up from 1.9466;
1.6933 Swiss francs, up from 1.6835; 1.1814 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1830; 6.6025 French francs, up from 6.5740; and 1,405.38
Italian lire, up from 1,400.25.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late
rates, included: 1.9495 West German marks, up from 1.9435; 1.6890
Swiss francs, up from 1.6830; 6.5925 French francs, up from 6.5710;
2.1935 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1920; 1,407.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,401.00, and 1.1807 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1842.
   Gold prices were higher in active trading. The late London gold

<HEAD>Anchor Says It's For Sale as Vitro Extends Tender Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anchor Glass Container Corp. directors have
agreed to seek a buyer for the nation's second-largest glass maker
in an attempt to thwart a unsolicited $280 million takeover bid from
a Mexican company.
   Anchor spokesman Thomas Davies on Friday said several suitors
have expressed interest in buying the entire company since the
hostile bid was launched last month by a subsidiary of Vitro SA,
which has extended its $20-a-share offer until Sept. 28.
   Davies would not identify any of the parties interested in
Anchor, whose board has urged shareholders to reject the offer by
Vitro, one of Mexico's major glass manufacturers.
   A committee of Anchor directors said a sale could be completed by
the end of October.
   ``Obviously, there cannot be any guarantee a sale will take
place,'' said Davies.
   Vitro, based in Monterrey, Mexico, announced Friday its
subsidiary, THR Corp., has been tendered about 72 percent of the
13.9 million Anchor shares outstanding. THR and its affiliates owned
about 1.43 million shares before the tender offer was announced.
   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Anchor rose 37{
cents a share to $19.37{. It was trading below $10 a share before
the tender offer was announced.
   In a news release late Thursday, a committee of Anchor directors
said that ``based upon the interests indicated to date by third
parties, it has determined that a sale of the company in its
entirety is the method most likely to succeed in maximizing
shareholder values at this time.''
   A Vitro spokeswoman declined to comment on its plans or Anchor's
announcement.
   Vitro has filed a suit in Delaware Chancery Court challenging
Anchor's anti-takeover defenses.
   Anchor lost $8.5 million last year on sales of $977.8 million,
while Vitro earned more than $150 million on revenues of nearly $1.1
billion.

<HEAD>Out of One Debt Junkyard, Into Another</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As American banks take careful steps to skirt the
black hole of Third World loans, they seem to be stumbling blindly
into another possible multibillion-dollar debt trap: high-risk junk
bonds.
   Three big New York banks set aside extra money this past week to
cover possible losses on loans to developing nations.
   The moves by J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., Chase Manhattan Corp. and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. reflected the deepening pessimism about
the ability of the so-called less-developed countries to repay the
huge sums lent to them in the 1970s to spur economic growth.
   While those bullet-biting measures suggested a more realistic
view of the Third World debt crisis, some banking experts worried
that the same mistakes might be repeated in the junk bond market for
takeovers and refinancings.
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., for example, recently issued an
investor alert about the danger of bank stocks, primarily because of
the increasing involvement of many banks in so-called highly
leveraged transactions, which includes junk-bond lending.
   ``This is a large potential problem,'' Prudential-Bache said.
``Exposures are meaningful and the loan-loss risk is real.''
   Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, a Wall Street firm that follows the
banking business, said in a study that most big U.S. banks had
highly leveraged transaction exposure that exceeded 100 percent of
their equity base. Many had more exposure in this area than they had
in Third World loans.
   Still, the banks seem to be forging ahead into this new market,
partly because of a fundamental tenet in the banking business: They
get high interest rate margins and can charge big fees.
   The trend seemed to accelerate this past week, when Bankers Trust
Co. announced plans to become the first bank to manage a corporate
bond sale, under recently relaxed federal rules on the types of
business that banks can conduct. Bankers Trust will manage a $150
million issue of junk bonds.
   One of the ironies banking analysts see in the bank move into
junk-bond lending is that they were reluctant to get involved in
this business 10 years ago, when it was new and highly profitable.
   Now they are among the last segments of the financial industry to
see junk bonds as an opportunity, even when there are signs that the
junk-bond market is faltering. Earlier this month, junk prices
plunged in the worst shakeout ever, as retail giant Campeau Corp.
suffered a financing crisis.
   ``I think part of what banks are doing is an irresistible urge to
do what others do,'' said James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest
Rate Observer and a frequent critic of the use of corporate debt.
   ``In that, they're not so different from the Washington press
corp and others who do business in groups,'' he said. ``Banks are
following the leaders. It's a time-honored axiom that banks tend to
catch on to trends at the tail end.''
   The insurance added against Third World debt losses was
nonetheless impressive. Morgan was the most aggressive of the three
banks, adding $2 billion to its reserves. The move will result in a
$1.8 billion loss to the bank for the current financial quarter.
   Chase boosted its bad-loan reserves by a third to $2.9 billion,
and Manufacturers Hanover boosted its reserves by nearly $1 billion
to total $2.4 billion. For Chase, the move will result in a
third-quarter loss of $1.1 billion, and Manufacturers will take a
$775 million third-quarter loss.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Major airlines raised fares for business travelers and tightened
cancellation penalties. The move, instigated by American Airlines,
was seen as a way for airlines to absorb the cost of higher fuel
prices and fall travel bargains offered during the summer.
   _Goverment reports suggested the economy is growing modestly, but
the news did little to help the languishing stock and bond markets.
The Labor Department said consumer prices steadied in August, the
first time in three years they didn't rise, signaling lower
inflation. The Commerce Department said consumer spending jumped
sharply in August and the economy grew at a 2.5 percent rate in the
second quarter.
   _Another large U.S. tiremaker agreed to sell itself to a foreign
competitor. French tire giant Michelin Group will buy Uniroyal
Goodrich Tire Co. in a $1.5 billion deal.
   _Elsewhere among corporate buyers and sellers, cosmetics concern
Noxell Corp. agred to merge with Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in a $1.3
billion stock swap; Chrysler Corp. said it would sell nearly half
its stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp. for $592 million; and
Britain's Jaguar PLC rejected investment overtures by Ford Motor Co.

   Bond prices finished slightly lower Friday in
light dealings as traders were wary of making big commitments in
advance of this weekend's meeting of major industrialized nations.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 1-16 point, or 63
cents for every $1,000 face amount, as its yield rose to 8.19
percent from 8.18 percent late Thursday.
   ``It's been like the calm before the storm, but I'm not saying
there is going to be any storm,'' said Maria Ramirez, economist for
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``There's nothing going on.''
   She said the relative inactivity reflected some anxiety about
decisions that may be made at this weekend's meeting of the finance
ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven major
industrialized nations.
   The group includes representatives from the United States, Japan,
West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   The group could make decisions that would affect the course of
the dollar on foreign exchange markets and the attractiveness of
dollar-denominated securities for foreign investors.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged to down 1-32 point, intermediate
maturities fell [ point and long-term issues dropped as much as 5-32
point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.68 to 1,174.66.
   In corporate trading, industrials were lower. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, fell 0.79 to 330.99.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 1-32 point. The average yield to
maturity was unchanged at 7.48 percent, the same as late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.01 percent as the
discount lost 6 basis points to 7.74 percent. Yields on six-month
bills held steady at 8.15 percent as the discount was firm at 7.74
percent. Yields on one-year bills issued at auction Thursday rose to
8.21 percent as the discount gained 4 basis points to 7.64 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 815-16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

<HEAD>Silver Rally Continues; Gains 23 Cents In Three Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver futures prices rose sharply for a third straight day
Friday on New York's Commodity Exchange but analysts were divided on
whether the market could sustain the technically inspired rally.
   On other markets, gold futures also rose; energy, coffee, grain
and soybean futures retreated; and livestock and meat futures were
mixed.
   Silver futures settled 10.5 cents to 11 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $5.286 a troy ounce. That
price reflects a gain of more than 23.1 cents in three days. The
more actively traded December contract finished at $5.38 a troy
ounce.
   Gold futures settled 30 cents to 70 cents higher with October at
$366.70 a troy ounce.
   Several analysts agreed the rally was largely technical,
representing waves of buying triggered by the September contract's
drop to $5.01 an ounce the previous Friday. The proximity to $5 an
ounce, a point of strong psychological resistance, gave market bears
pause and brought in new buyers.
   Although supply-and-demand factors have not changed, said Peter
Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New
York, the December contract's close above $5.35 indicated it could
rise as high as $5.55 an ounce before finding substantial resistance.
   But Scott Hinton of Elder Futures Inc. said the December contract
would have a hard time ramming past $5.40.
   ``I think gold has a little bit more to go on the upside but
silver is getting close to the level where you'd expect to find
fairly good resistance,'' he said.
   Most energy futures ended lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, although the October gasoline contract advanced slightly
amid speculation about the extent of damage caused by Hurricane Hugo
to an Amerada Hess Corp. refinery on the Caribbean island of St.
Croix.
   Other energy contracts retreated on profit-taking after rallying
sharply on hurricane-related fears earlier in the week.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 27 cents to 35 cents
lower with November at $19.28 a barrel; heating oil was .61 cent to
.84 cent lower with October at 56.97 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.04 cents lower to .09 cent higher with October at
61.95 cents a gallon.
   Coffee futures fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange as hopes for a restoration of coffee export quotas faded.
   The International Coffee Organization opens a two-week meeting
Monday in London but most experts do not expect the 74
nation-members to agree on new price-support measures.
   Coffee settled 1.88 cents to 3.38 cents lower with December at
80.65 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures tumbled on the Chicago Board of Trade, leading
the grain markets lower as fears of a hard frost this weekend in the
Midwest receded.
   Wheat futures settled 2\ cents to 5 cents lower with December at
$3.89\ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with
December at $2.30 a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to { cent higher
with December at at $1.40} a bushel; soybeans were 8{ cents lower to
1{ cents higher with November at $5.74\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures advanced on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of an Agriculture Department
report that showed a record 45.4-million-pound decline in frozen
pork belly stocks last month.
   Analysts said the report was within expectations and should have
little market impact.
   The USDA reported 50 million pounds of pork bellies still in cold
storage as of Sept. 1.
   The USDA announced after the close that 7,000 to 10,000 tons _ or
up to 20 million pounds _ of U.S. pork bellies would be donated to
Poland.
   Live cattle futures settled .28 cent lower to .23 cent higher
with October at 71.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent
lower to .23 cent higher with September at 83.25 cents a pound; live
hogs were .25 cent to .90 cent higher with October at 42.80 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to .45 cent higher with
February at 49.20 cents a pound.

   Energy futures prices declined Friday, led by
sagging crude prices after hurricane-related damage earlier in the
week had sent products soaring.
   ``We had profit-taking after the hype-up from the hurricane,''
said Linda Simard, energy broker with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
dropped 34 cents to finish the week at $19.28 a barrel. Contracts
for later delivery posted similar losses.
   With the exception of the front-month unleaded gasoline contract,
refined products also slipped.
   Unleaded gasoline for October delivery inched up .09 cent to
61.95 cents a gallon. The contract had gained 4.19 cents in the
previous two sessions after news that a big refinery in the U.S.
Virgin Islands was severely damaged by Hurricane Hugo.
   Heating oil for October delivery declined .61 cent to close at
56.97 cents a gallon.
   The refinery on St. Croix, Virgin Islands, owned by Amerada Hess
Corp., supplies markets mainly in the eastern United States. The
facility, with a capacity of 545,000 barrels, had been turning out
about 400,000 barrels a day of gasoline, distillates and other
refined oil products before the storm.
   Amerada Hess has said the refinery would resume partial
operations in about 30 days and full operations in 60 days.
   A company spokesman said Friday that officials would continue to
assess the damage over the weekend.
   ``We will have a better fix on things next week,'' said the
spokesman, who asked not to be identified. ``I think we're pretty
confident that we can do it in 60 days.''
   The official said Amerada also had storage terminals in
Charleston, S.C., that sustained minor damage from the same
hurricane as it moved northward.
   Damage to the refinery caused a normal weakening of crude prices,
analysts said.
   ``The shutdown of the refinery puts more crude back on the
marketplace,'' said Richard Redoglio, energy broker with Merrill
Lynch Energy Futures.
   In addition, the OPEC meeting this weekend added some jitters
that helped dampen prices, traders said.
   ``People are taking profits and liquidating positions in advance
of the meeting,'' Redoglio said.
   The meeting of OPEC's eight-member monitoring committee begins
Saturday in Geneva. Analysts said investors are acting cautiously
although no substantial changes are expected to emerge from the
meeting.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Group Raises Cummins Stake Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Hong Kong investment concern said Friday it
had increased its stake in Cummins Engine Co. for the second time
this week, to 13.5 percent.
   Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd. said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that it had purchased another
204,700 shares of the Indiana diesel engine-maker's stock since
Tuesday.
   The purchases, all on the New York Stock Exchange at prices
ranging between $62.51 and $63.17, gave IEP a total of 1.38 million
shares of Cummins common stock, raising its stake from 11.5 percent
to 13.5 percent.
   IEP did not indicate whay it was increasing its stake in Cummins,
which earlier this year headed off a potential takeover when
descendants of the company's founder bought out the stake of a
British conglomerate.
   On Wednesday, IEP, a Hong Kong-based concern with manufacturing,
restaurant and automobile retailing subsidiaries in the United
States, Britain and France, announced it was pushing its initial
stake of 9.9 percent to 11.5 percent.
   On Thursday, the Columbus, Ind.-based Cummins announced that it
expects a substantial third-quarter loss in part because of a sharp
drop in the demand for North American trucks.

<HEAD>More Big Airlines Jump on Fare Hike Bandwagon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More major airlines jumped on the fare increase bandwagon Friday,
matching an American Airlines initiative that will raise some
advance-purchase fares by more than 15 percent and double
cancellation penalties.
   United Airlines and Eastern Airlines were among competitors of
Dallas-based American that followed its move. On Thursday, Delta Air
Lines, Continental Airlines, Pan Am Corp. and Trans World Airlines
matched American's increases.
   ``We feel that it makes economic sense at this time,'' said Robin
Matell, a spokesman for strikebound Eastern at its Miami
headquarters.
   Northwest Airlines hadn't decided yet and planned to study the
matter over the weekend, spokesman Doug Miller said from Eagan, Minn.
   ``We're still holding out,'' he said. ``They're going to think
about it a little bit longer.''
   That most major airlines went along, however, virtually assured
that the fare boosts would stick. The increases, proposed by
American earlier this week will take effect Sept. 29.
   Under the changes, the popular ``MaxSaver'' cut-rate fare often
used by vacationers, which must be purchased 14 days in advance,
will be increased by $10 to $20 round trip. A ``MaxSaver'' ticket on
American between Dallas and Los Angeles, for example, would jump
from $338 to $358 round trip. The ``MaxSaver'' tickets would remain
non-refundable.
   Also, fares will be raised on seven-day advance tickets by $30 to
$60 round trip. The same Dallas-Los Angeles round trip ticket bought
seven days in advance would go from $378 to $438. The penalty for
changing or canceling a reservation would double to 50 percent of
the ticket price.
   Most of the carriers said they were matching the move mainly to
stay competitive. Atlanta-based Delta also said a sharp rise in fuel
prices, along with a large number of discount tickets sold recently,
prompted it to follow suit.
   American, one of the nation's largest carriers, said it proposed
the fare hikes in an effort to improve passenger yields. An
airline's yield reflects the average revenue from passengers for
each mile flown and is a critical barometer of financial strength.
   Many airline industry analysts expect little improvement in
yields overall for the rest of the year and into 1990.

   Manufacturers Hanover Leasing International Corp.
said Friday it agreed to sell its entire 45 percent stake in Korea
Industrial Leasing Co. Ltd. to Nippon Credit Bank of Japan for $68
million.
   The leasing company, a unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., said
the sale reflected a strategic decision to sell most of its
international leasing businesses and redirect resources to business
activities in the U.S. market.
   Thomas Palmer, chairman of the leasing concern, said the sale
does not affect Manufacturers Hanover's other banking activities in
Korea.
   Korea Industrial Leasing, based in Seoul, is the second-largest
leasing company in Korea and had assets of about $800 million at the
end of 1988.
   It provides financing to businesses for general equipment leases.
   The Korea Development Bank owns 50 percent of Korea Industrial
Leasing and the remaining 5 percent is held by the Korea Exchange
Bank.
   Officials of Nippon Credit Bank said the acquisition will enable
the bank to strengthen and expand its relationships with companies
in Korea.

   Mickie's Gift Shop is infringing on Mickey's
good name, says Walt Disney Co. in a trademark-infringement lawsuit
filed in federal court against the store.
   Disney has tried to get the owner of the shop, Joseph Csokasy, to
change the name of his business, but he refused and Disney is taking
him to court in Orlando.
   The store's name dilutes the ``distinctive quality'' of Disney's
trademarks and ``has confused, and is likely to continue to confuse,
the public,'' according to the lawsuit filed this past week.
   The suit asks that the shop refrain from using its name, the
words ``Mickey Mouse'' or the Mickey Mouse ears logo and
reproductions.
   ``We aren't saying that this shop sells any illegal or inferior
goods,'' said Robert Duckworth, an Orlando lawyer representing
Disney. ``The lawsuit is strictly over the name.''
   Csokasy was unavailable for comment Friday.

   President Bush defended his capital gains tax
cut Friday, but House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said support was
growing for a rival Democratic plan that would widen availability of
Individual Retirement Accounts and increase taxes on the wealthy to
pay for it.
   Foley called the Bush plan ``a positive harm to the economy,''
but the president stood by his proposal and visited a Maine tree
farm to showcase a business that might benefit from the legislation.
   At the Morse Tree Farm near Wells, Bush was urged by co-owner
Martin Morse to ``bring back the capital gains exclusion.'' Morse
argued that tree farmers face substantial costs, long delays and
unique risks before there is any income from their crop.
   ``One 12-hour storm can wipe out 30 years work,'' he told the
president, adding that he was sure some tree farmers in South
Carolina had been devastated by Hurricane Hugo.
   Bush's visit was meant to put pressure on lawmakers with timber
in their districts. Profits from tree sales are considered capital
gains under the bill, and dropping the top tax rate would be a boon
to those sellers.
   ``I've heard some on the (Capitol) Hill deride this as just
another tax cut for the rich, but that simply is not the case,''
Bush said of his proposal before leaving Washington.
   On the contrary, he told an Agriculture Department radio
audience, it ``would put money in the little guy's pocket.''
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., joined the
long-distance debate, retorting from St. Louis, ``The Bush proposal
doesn't `put money in the little guy's pocket' _ it picks his
pocket.''
   Democrats fighting the Bush plan said statistics show 80 percent
of the benefits would go to people earning $100,000 or more a year.
And Foley said the Democrats would keep pushing their own plan _
which would raise taxes on the rich to pay for the new IRA tax
breaks _ despite Bush's promise to veto it.
   ``I think we are doing very well'' in enlisting support, Foley
told reporters. ``We have a pretty good popular constituency.''
   Foley cited a Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll that said 49
percent of the people questioned prefer expansion of IRAs, while 38
percent favor Bush's capital gains tax reduction idea. The poll
noted that the preference for IRAs was even greater among
middle-income voters: 53 percent to 35 percent.
   A showdown vote on capital gains is expected next week during
House debate on a huge budget bill that also carries such
contentious issues as revising or repealing the Medicare
catastrophic illness plan and expanding federally subsidized child
care.
   In advance of the capital gains battle, both sides agreed it was
close and they were fighting over the conservative, mostly Southern
branch of the Democratic Party, including the group that pushed a
Bush-backed plan through the House Ways and Means Committee. The
House Republican minority is united in supporting Bush.
   Six Democrats sided with the Ways and Means panel's 13
Republicans to pass an amendment that would cut the maximum capital
gains rate from 33 percent to 19.6 percent. It would then rebound to
28 percent beginning in 1992, but no tax would be levied on gains
unless they exceeded inflation.
   In their hunt for votes, the Democratic leadership included a
small capital gains cut in their own plan, setting the top rate at
28 percent, but their main feature was a return of IRA tax breaks.
   The Democratic proposal would eliminate restrictions passed in
1986 that keep many workers, especially in the upper middle class,
from having a deductible IRA plan. Under the new plan, the money
could be withdrawn before retirement without paying a penalty if
used to finance the down payment on a first home or for college
education.
   To pay for the IRAs and reduce the deficit, the Democrats would
raise tax rates for the nation's wealthiest 600,000 couples and
individuals.
   Under current law, the tax rate for upper-middle-income Americans
is 33 percent, but it drops back to 28 percent for those at the
uppermost income levels. The Democrats would raise that top rate to
33 percent.
   While Bush was followed by an entourage of reporters and
television cameramen, the House Democratic leadership worked to log
some television time including appearances on weekend talk shows.
   ``I think that there may be some groups that are going to support
the IRA proposal and may even do it with television and radio,''
Foley said. ``But we have no plans to buy television time,'' he said.

   Consumers taking advantage of bargains
increased their spending in August by 0.9 percent even though
incomes rose only 0.4 percent, the government said in another report
pointing toward continued economic expansion.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that the jump in consumer
spending followed a 0.6 percent gain in July and was the largest
since a 1.1 percent advance in April.
   Income growth slowed from a 0.7 percent advance in July.
Nevertheless, personal incomes have increased for nine consecutive
months.

   Chrysler Corp. said it is selling about half its
stock in the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and will
receive about $310 million after taxes.
   An analyst said Friday the move indicates that the No. 3 U.S.
automaker, which is in the midst of a $1 billion cost-cutting
program, is being cautious about the future of the domestic auto
market.
   Chrysler said the sale of Mitsubishi stock will drop its holdings
in its Japanese partner to 12.1 percent from 21.8 percent. A group
of 25 Japanese financial institutions is buying the stock for about
$592 million.

   A group of Thomson McKinnon Inc. employees filed
a $100 million lawsuit claiming that executives of the Wall Street
brokerage bankrupted an employee trust fund and used company assets
to pay for apartments and a yacht.
   The federal suit filed Friday also alleges that a deal to sell
struggling Thomson McKinnon this year fell through after buyer
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. discovered the brokerage was
overvalued by $80 million to $95 million.
   After the deal collapsed, Prudential-Bache in July purchased only
Thomson McKinnon's retail brokerage offices and customer accounts.

<HEAD>Wang Announces Borrowing Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its latest effort to strengthen its financial
future, Wang Laboratories Inc. announced Friday that it has
completed a deal to borrow up to $175 million.
   Wang officials said in a prepared statement the agreement with
CIT Group-Business Credit Inc., whose parent company is
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., is part of its recently-announced
restructuring plan.
   Wang reported a $424 million loss for the fiscal year ended June
30, which led to thousands of employee layoffs and upper level
reshuffling. The company expects to layoff 2,200 of its 30,000
employees by the end of this month. It also named Richard Miller to
succeed Frederick A. Wang as president. Frederick is the son of the
founder and chairman An Wang.
   ``Our revenue outlook reflects the difficult competitive
environment which we have been experiencing for some time,
particularly in the U.S.,'' Miller said in written statement.
   The borrowing agreement consists of $120 million in revolving
credit notes that are secured by domestic accounts, and $55 million
in notes secured by domestic real estate.
   Miller said Wang anticipates that the agreement will give it the
capital necessary to complete its debt restructuring.
   Wang plans to sell some of its less substantial businesses and
assets to help with the restructuring.
   The Lowell-based company introduced a new line of four
IBM-compatible personal computers earlier this month in an attempt
to restore customer confidence and boost sales. The computers sport
a price tag of about $600 below that of Houston-based Compaq, the
leading producer of IBM compatibles.

<HEAD>P&amp;G Enters Women's Cosmetics With Noxell Acquisition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., the consumer products powerhouse, will
enter the rough-and-tumble world of women's cosmetics with its $1.3
billion acquisition of Noxell Corp., maker of the No. 1 Cover Girl
cosmetics line.
   The stock-swap deal announced Friday, which was approved
unanimously by the boards of both companies, also will add Noxell's
Noxzema skin cream, Clarion makeup and Lestoil household cleaner to
bulging P&amp;G arsenal of megabrands.
   The consolidating cosmetics industry already had grabbed the
spotlight this year. This summer Unilever, the British-Dutch
consumer giant, completed a $1.55 billion acquisition of the Faberge
and Elizabeth Arden lines of cosmetics and toiletries. Following
that deal, Avon Products Inc. successfully rebuffed takeover
overtures from rival door-to-door marketer Amway Corp.
   The Procter &amp; Gamble merger announcement sent Noxell soaring $10
to $31.25 Friday in over-the-counter trading. On the New York Stock
Exchange, P&amp;G fell $2 to $119.87{.
   Under terms of the agreement, P&amp;G will exchange 0.272 shares of
its common stock for each of Noxell's 40.5 million common and class
B shares in a tax-free transaction. Based on the closing price for
P&amp;G, the transaction would have a value of $32.60 per Noxell share.
   Noxell, based in Hunt Valley, Md., will be operated as a P&amp;G
unit. The 75-year-old company has 2,200 employees and annual revenue
of roughly $522 million from sales in the United States, Canada and
Europe.
   Analysts applauded the move as strategically sound. While P&amp;G has
a number of successful skin care products, including Oil of Olay,
Bain de Soleil and Clearasil, it has no cosmetics lines.
   ``P&amp;G has done a lot of work in skin care technology ... and this
will add another leg to their delivery systems,'' said Jay Freedman
of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   He said Cover Girl is the No. 1 mass market cosmetics line in the
United States.
   For its part, Noxell was attracted by P&amp;G's resources for
research and development. Last year P&amp;G spent more than $650 million
on research and product development.
   In addition, P&amp;G can add ``international marketing support which
should enhance the long-term growth of these brands,'' said John
Smale, P&amp;G's chairman and chief executive.
   Noxell Chairman and Chief Executive George Bunting Jr. said in a
statement, ``An association with the right company appeared the
ideal way to achieve this, and Procter &amp; Gamble is clearly the right
company.''
   P&amp;G, which is based in Cincinnati, reported worldwide sales of
$21.4 billion last year. Among its brands are Ivory soap, Crest
toothpaste, Pampers and Luvs disposable diapers, Tide laundry
detergent, Duncan Hines cookies, Folgers coffee, Crisco cooking oil
and Pringles potato chips.
   Known for its slow but steady approach to business, P&amp;G has had a
healthy appetite for acquisitions this decade.
   Since 1981, the company has spent more than $3 billion buying up
stakes in 16 companies worldwide. Among its larger deals, P&amp;G
acquired Richardson-Vicks International, maker of Vaporub, Vicks
cough drops and Formula 44, in 1985 for $1.2 billion.
   That same year the company acquired G.D. Searle's
over-the-counter pharmaceuticals business for more than $300
million, adding to its battery of health-care products that includes
Pepto-Bismol and Metamucil fiber supplement.
   Like other P&amp;G buyouts, the Noxell deal was forged as a friendly
transaction. P&amp;G does not plan any immediate, significant changes at
Noxell, although some employee relocations may become necessary.
   The merger is subject to approval by Noxell shareholders, the
Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Approval by P&amp;G shareholders is not required because the company
has sufficient numbers of authorized stock shares not yet issued to
provide the merger basis, P&amp;G spokesman William Dobson said.
   The merger should be completed by year's end, Dobson said.
