<TEXT>
   One of the suspects in a cult of human
sacrifice pointed out the grave of a 13th body on Thursday and
police ordered him to dig it up, badgering him as he reeled from
the heat and the stench.
   ``You'll do it with your hands if you have to,'' one officer
told Sergio Martinez after the suspect was handed a pick and shovel.
   Martinez, 22, had been taken back to a ranch near Matamoros,
where a dozen bodies were unearthed Tuesday. He and other suspects
have told authorities there were 14 bodies buried on the ranch.
   In a dramatic public confession Wednesday, some of the five
suspects in custody said victims were put to death in rituals that
were intended to provide a ``magical shield'' for members of a
drug-smuggling ring.
   Under the gaze of police on Thursday, Martinez went to work
digging up the new grave and quickly revealed the body of a man in
his 30s. Martinez said the man had been buried about four months
ago.
   The suspect asked for a face mask but was told to keep working.
``You didn't need one when you buried him,'' an officer said.
   However, Martinez was given a mask minutes later when he said he
could not dig because of the stench. Later Martinez collapsed and
asked for water. Two onlookers with the police helped him complete
the job.
   So far, the only victim to be identified was Mark Kilroy, a
21-year-old University of Texas pre-medical student who was
kidnapped on the streets of Matamoros last month during spring
break.
   The suspects have said they killed at the demand of Adolfo de
Jesus Constanzo, whom they called ``godfather.'' They said
Constanzo, 26, and Sara Maria Aldrete, 24, called the ``witch,''
believed human sacrifices gave the members of cult protection from
harm.
   Cameron County Sheriff's Lt. George Gavito said that Constanzo,
a Cuban who has contacts in Miami, was last seen Tuesday over the
border in Brownsville, Texas.
   A warning that Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete might be heading for
Miami was read to police officers there at roll calls Thursday, but
``at this time we're not taking any active stance on it,'' said
Detective Marie Chaney.
   Constanzo's family was known to live in a middle-class
neighborhood in the Miami area from the late 1970s to 1984,
authorities said.
   Meanwhile, new details emerged about the cult leaders, who are
said to have driven luxury cars and worn expensive clothes bought
with drug profits.
   ``They had a wealthy lifestyle, buying '89 Mercedes, cash and
all kinds of luxury cars and telephones and clothing,'' Gavito said.
   That description may fit the profile of a successful drug
smuggler, but details about Ms. Aldrete's life fit no such pattern.
   ``Apparently, Sara was leading a double life: as a witch in
Mexico and as a dean's honor roll student at Texas Southmost
College,'' said Sheriff's Deputy Carlos Tapia.
   Texas Southmost College is a two-year college in Brownsville
with an enrollment of 6,500.
   Ms. Aldrete, a resident alien from Mexico, was a physical
education major and was one of 33 students listed in the college's
``Who's Who'' directory in 1987-88. ``Who's Who'' members are
nominated by faculty, have a grade point average of at least 3.0
and are active in campus organizations.
   She was also president of the college's soccer booster club that
year and recipient of the ``Outstanding Physical Education
Student'' award. During the current session, Ms. Aldrete was
enrolled in 13 hours of courses, including government, psychology,
physical education, Spanish and first aid.
   ``We're shocked and astounded that this could go on, that a
student here could be involved in something like this,'' said Mike
Gonzalez, a spokesman for the school.
   Cameron County Sheriff's officials released photos of the
Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete, describing them as ``extremely
dangerous.''
   A search of Ms. Aldrete's home in Matamoros revealed an altar
and blood-spatters, but no bones or bodies, Gavito said.
   Five suspects have been arrested and four talked to reporters
Wednesday, two of them saying that Constanzo committed most of the
slayings.
   One of the suspects in custody, Serafin M. Hernandez of
Brownsville, was a law enforcement major at the community college.
He was enrolled in two courses, ``Criminal Investigation'' and
``Introduction to Sociology,'' according to school records.
   In Matamoros, the bodies of the victims were at funeral homes
waiting to be identified through dental records because of the
state of decomposition, according to Oran Neck, a Brownsville-based
U.S. Customs Service agent.
   Neck said U.S. federal drug agents will be assigned to the case.
He said authorities have learned the group was importing more than
a ton of marijuana into the United States each week.
   ``It is a little bit larger drug trafficking group than we
initially anticipated or discovered and the Drug Enforcment
Administration is joining us in the investigation,'' he said.
   Neck said U.S. officials were trying to identify a body believed
to be another American and said that they were working on having
Kilroy's body returned to the United States.
   At a memorial service for Kilroy Thursday night, the mother of
the 21-year-old University of Texas pre-medical student asked about
1,200 people attending the Mass for her son to pray for the drug
smugglers as well as their victims.
   ``I just ask you to pray for all of the young men who were found
with him,'' Helen Kilroy said. overflow crowd at St. Luke's
Catholic Church in Brownsville.
   ``Pray for the people who have done these things,'' Helen Kilroy
asked the congreation at St. Luke's Church. ``Pray that they are
caught and that the Lord will enter their hearts, and they will
know what they have done is wrong.''
   ``Pray that they will know there is love.''
   Kilroy's father, James Kilroy, said Wednesday that he was
concerned that some murder suspects in Mexico are sometimes
released after paying huge fines, but Cameron County District
Attorney Ben Euresti said he believed Mexican officials would
aggressively prosecute the suspects.
   ``I'm confident that the Mexican authorities will handle this
case properly and that they will be prosecuted accordingly,''
Euresti said.
   A cauldron with a turtle, brains and other items were found near
the graves at the ranch along with bowls containing burned goats'
heads and a mutilated rooster.

   The ruling Sandinista party on
Thursday condemned the U.S. Congress' approval of a $49.7 million
humanitarian aid package for the Contra rebels, calling it a threat
to the Nicaraguan government.
   The Sandinista National Liberation Front on Thursday issued a
communique shortly after the Senate vote, saying its members
``repudiate the approval of these new funds by the U.S. Congress
for the mercenary forces.''
   ``This has violated one more time the rights and the order of
international justice and makes fun of the will of the Central
American presidents expressed in the document of Costa del Sol, El
Salvador, on Feb. 14.''
   After a two-day meeting at a resort outside the capital of San
Salvador, the presidents of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala,
Costa Rica and Honduras agreed to come up with a plan by mid-May to
dismantle the rebel force.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega also promised to push for
democratic reforms in his country and moved up elections by 10
months, to February 1990.
   The statement, signed by the front's nine commanders, called the
humanitarian aid package ``threats by the U.S. government to apply
new forms of force'' against the leftist government.
   The aid package was harshly criticized by the Sandinista party
and Ortega. President Bush first unveiled the bipartisan plan to
provide non-lethal aid to the estimated 11,000 Contra rebels who
have been living with their families in Honduran border camps since
Congress cut off military aid in February 1988.
   Ortega has charged any kind of aid to the Contras interferes
with regional peace efforts.

   A pediatric nurse who killed two of her babies
and tried to kill a third was released Wednesday from the mental
hospital where she has been held since she was acquitted of the
deaths by reason of insanity.
   Ann Green, confined to the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center for
the past 37 days, would not be dangerous if released, state mental
health officials, Dr. Art Dubow and Dr. David Webber, said.
   ``I'm happy to be free,'' Mrs. Green, 43, said as she left the
courtroom where she was tried for killing her children. ``I hope
other women and other people understand what I went through and
that it helps them.''
   Mrs. Green was freed pending another hearing April 27, but her
freedom has restrictions. She is required to continue treatment,
and must have no working, residential or caretaking situation
involving children, including her one surviving child.
   Mrs. Green's attorney, Michael Dowd, objected to the conditions
that bar her contact with children. Dowd said Mrs. Green had been
dangerous only to her own infants under stress and this was due to
post-partum depression.
   Mrs. Green was acquitted last September of two counts of murder
for smothering her newborn children in 1980 and 1982 and one count
of attempted murder for trying to kill a third in 1985.
   The third child, Larry Jr., was saved by a neighbor after Mrs.
Green falsely yelled to her that the boy had inexplicably stopped
breathing. Larry Jr., 3, is now living with relatives.

   Actor Kevin Costner says he's making his
debut as a director because he wants to make sure a frontier film
being shot in South Dakota this summer is done correctly.
   ``I take it very personally what this movie should be,'' Coster
said Wednesday, while touring the state for filming locations.
   Costner also will play the leading role in ``Dancing With
Wolves,'' which tells the story of Lt. John Dunbar, who is assigned
to a frontier post in the 1860s. Dunbar and an Indian man both go
through changes while learning to understand people of an
unfamiliar culture, an official of the film production company has
said.
   Hollywood studio officials and others in the film industry have
suggested many changes in the movie, Costner said. But he said as
director he wants to tell the story the way it should be told,
without making changes just to ensure the film is a financial
success.
   ``This is not so much a movie of how the West was won. It's more
about how it was lost,'' Costner said.

the CBS censors and the network's cancellation of his comedy show,
he can't help but smile.

   In the same article, brother Dick credited the team's longevity

   Actor Reginald Vel Johnson, who played the
police sergeant in the blockbuster movie ``Die Hard,'' has been
arrested for investigation of cocaine possession, authorities said.
   Johnson was arrested Tuesday night during a stakeout of an
alleged drug dealer's home, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt.
Terry Judge.
   He said deputies watched customers drive up, make a purchase and
drive away. Deputies followed the buyers until they were out of
sight, then stopped them and searched them for illegal drugs, he
said.
   Johnson was stopped and booked for investigation of possession
of cocaine and held in jail overnight. He was released Wednesday on
$2,500 bail, authorities said.

   Princess Anne and her husband, Mark Phillips, are
1,000 miles apart and are still silent on rumors of a rift in their
15-year marriage.
   The 38-year-old princess carried out a typically busy day of
public engagements Wednesday, starting with the opening of a body
scanning unit at Wycombe General Hospital and ending at a gala
premiere of the American movie ``Three Fugitives'' to benefit the
Save The Children Fund.
   Her 40-year-old husband left for Spain on Tuesday, and visited
the April fair in Seville on Wednesday.
   Royal Navy Commander Timothy Laurence, 34, whose letters to Anne
touched off the wave of speculation, remained out of sight
Wednesday at Windsor Castle where he was on duty as an aide to
Queen Elizabeth II.
   Rumors of trouble in the princess' marriage have circulated
since 1981. The latest round began Thursday when The Sun tabloid,
Britain's top-selling paper with a circulation of 4.2 million,
reported it had received four letters sent to Anne and stolen from
her briefcase.
   Buckingham Palace late Saturday identified the letter-writer as
Laurence after a Sunday paper said it would do so. On Tuesday, The
Sun quoted unidentified friends of Laurence's as saying he ``is
besotted with Princess Anne and believes she loves him, too.''

<HEAD>Experimental Device Used For First Time To Take Pictures Of Blood
Vessels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET McCONNAUGHEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experimental device that takes pictures
inside blood vessels was used on people for the first time, and one
of its developers sees significant applications for it.
   ``I had two patients today watching us do it,'' Dr. Christopher
White said Wednesday. ``They kept telling me, `Turn the TV so I can
see it, Doc.'
   ``We had to explain that it was important for us to see the TV
and we'd show them the videotape later.''
   Ochsner Medical Institutions, a suburban New Orleans hospital
that hired White and his partner, Dr. Stephen Ramee, after they got
out of the Army in July, is the first to start clinical trials of
their gadet _ the percutaneous coronary angioscope.
   ``It's of great interest to be able to see the inside of the
coronary arteries from the outside of the patient. So this type of
device may have important application,'' said Dr. Albert Raizner,
director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the Methodist
Hospital in Houston and an associate professor at Baylor College of
Medicine.
   The machine, made by Advanced Cardiovascular Systems of Mountain
View, Calif., has been approved for trial by the Food and Drug
Administration at four other hospitals, White said. Those tests are
expected to start in the next few months.
   Fiber optics have been used for at least a decade to look into
the digestive tract, but it was only in recent years that optical
fibers became small enough to use in blood vessels.
   White said the angioscope which he, Ramee and engineer Tom Doyle
designed is smaller than those already on the market, so it can get
into smaller arteries.
   It's a triple tube of plastic, less than one-quarter inch wide.
One section holds 2,000 extremely thin optical fibers in a bundle
smaller in circumference than pencil lead. A second, hollow tube
carries medicine or saline solution. The third holds a tiny balloon
of the sort now used to flatten cholesterol plaques in a procedure
called balloon angioplasty.
   An X-ray guidance system is used to route the triple tube from a
blood vessel at the top of the leg toward the heart. Once it's
where doctors want it, the balloon is filled with liquid and a tiny
amount of saline may be pumped in to clear away the opaque blood.
   That is one of the major refinements of his machine, White said.
Several Japanese machines are on the market, he said, but they rely
on flushing salt water through the arteries to clear away the blood.
   If the device proves as safe as he expects, it could be used to
see whether a blood clot, cholesterol plaque or spasm in an artery
is causing a heart attack, White said. Each is treated differently,
and doctors can't be certain which treatment should be used, he
said.
   It also would let doctors drip medicine to dissolve the clot
precisely at the spot it was needed and stop the drip as soon as
the clot disappeared, he said.

<TEXT>
   Is Fido's breath worse than his bite?
   If so, maybe it's time you learned about doggie dental hygiene,
says the new president of the American Veterinary Dental Society.
   ``It's a myth that dogs just get doggie breath,'' said Dr. Gary
Goldstein, whose organization has grown from 10 members in 1977 to
850 today.
   ``But if we get their teeth cleaned once a year and brushed
everyday they won't have doggie breath.''
   Goldstein, a veterinarian in Houston, was elected president of
the society at the start of this week's convention of the American
Animal Hospital Association.
   About 1,300 veterinarians are attending the conference to hear
lectures on topics such as anorexia in Angoras and pacemakers in
pugs. But pet dentistry, according to Goldstein, is the
fastest-growing veterinary care specialty.
   ``Dental problems in animals have been around for years,''
Goldstein said. ``We're now just recognizing that they're problems
that can be taken care of. Just about exactly the same thing that
can be done in human dentistry we can do in animal dentistry.''
   Preventive care includes a daily brushing of a pet's teeth with
a special brush and toothpaste and a professional cleaning and
checkup each year by a veterinarian. More extensive treatment can
even include braces.
   Many pet owners are not aware that Rover's bad breath may be
sign of a more serious problem, that he needs a root canal or has
an overbite that makes it difficult to chew properly.
   ``Ninety percent of all pets in the United States have some type
of dental disease,'' Goldstein said. ``When I work in the clinics,
it seems like every animal that comes in has some kind of dental
problem.''
   Nevertheless, Goldstein has had a problem getting people to take
pet dentistry seriously. Even his colleagues have been known to
chuckle.
   ``If the vets laugh and joke about it, then their clients will
laugh and joke about it and we're not getting anywhere,'' Goldstein
said. ``That's why we need to have meetings like this. If we can't
spread the word to vets, then certainly their clients aren't going
to be aware there's a problem.''
   Goldstein said the cost of dental treatments such as root
canals, crowns and orthodontics did not seem to deter pet owners
from getting the work done.
   ``One of the reasons it has blossomed is that animals now are
more companions than they are just pets,'' he said. ``We need to do
all we can do to accommodate these people who want the best for
their animals.''
   Goldstein's start in veterinarian dentistry began when he was
preparing to graduate from the University of Minnesota in 1984.
There had been no lectures on animal dentistry, and he noticed that
the veterinarians he worked with virtually ignored broken teeth and
other dental problems. So, noting that the trend in veterinary
medicine was toward specialization, he decided he had found his
niche.
   Goldstein does only pet dental work and says he's ``swamped.''
   About 90 percent of his work is on the mouths of dogs and cats,
but he has also been called out to the zoo to fill five cavities in
the mouth of a grizzly bear and to the University of Houston to do
three root canals on the school's mascot cougar.
   But promoting preventative dental care for pets is his primary
concern.
   ``If we can get them on a preventative dental program, we can
extend their lives by two or three years,'' Goldstein said.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's civil war began its 15th
year today shaken by the conflict's most relentless artillery
battles, raising fears that the ``final battle'' between Christians
and Moslems may be looming.
   ``We've never been so far away from a settlement and never so
much at a loss for future options,'' columnist Sarkis Naoum wrote
in the independent An-Nahar daily. ``There isn't even a glimmer at
the end of the tunnel.''
   By official estimates, which are questionable in a country where
government authority collapsed years ago, more than 150,000 people
have been killed. Unofficial records put the death toll far higher.
   The latest fighting, which began March 8, is primarily a
confrontation between Gen. Michel Aoun, who commands some 20,000
mainly Christian troops in Lebanon's fractured army, versus Syria
and its Moslem allies.
   Aoun, the Christian prime minister, is in a struggle for power
with Salim Hoss, who formed a Moslem Cabinet shortly after outgoing
President Amin Gemayel named Aoun in September. The Christian
premier has vowed to drive out the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.
   The renewed fighting ended a two-year lull in the civil war
during which Lebanon's Moslem and leftist militias underlined their
apparently limitless propensity for bloodshed by mauling each other
in internecine battles.
   But, as it has repeatedly done in the last 14 years, the civil
war has resumed with a vengeance. Even by Lebanon's standards, the
shelling by both sides has been ferocious.
   Tens of thousands of shells and rockets have rained down on both
sides. In the worst exchanges, 100 were exploding every minute in
the Christian sector, which has borne the brunt of the violence.
   As usual, most of the more than 180 people killed and nearly 700
wounded in recent days have been civilians. Police said 60 percent
were Christian. Military casualties have been minimal.
   Thousands of Christians, ringed on three sides by hostile forces
with the Mediterranean their main escape route, have fled by sea to
nearby Cyprus, while Moslems drove overland to Syria or Jordan for
safety.
   For the families left behind, huddled in bomb shelters or
basements _ with food, fuel and power running low _ there appeared
to be no end in sight to the civil war that began April 13, 1975.
   On that day, Christian gunmen killed 29 Palestinians in a bus
ambush in Beirut after an activist of the rightist Christian
Phalange Party was assassinated.
   The origins of the war lie in the Christians' alarm at the
growth of the Palestinian guerrilla power in Lebanon and Moslem
demands for an equal share of power with the Christians, who had
dominated Lebanon since independence from France in 1943.
   At that time, the French deemed that the Christians, mainly
Maronites, were the majority. But since then, the Moslems have
become the majority, making up an estimated 55 percent of the 4
million population. The Christians have refused to surrender their
long-held privileges.
   Since 1975, Lebanon has become the battleground for regional
powers like Syria and Israel.
   The civil war has degenerated into a complex web of overlapping
conflicts between rival factions that has defied all attempts to
end the fighting, including the ill-fated intervention of the
U.S.-led Multinational Force in 1982.
   The latest explosion came after Aoun, reasserting the state's
long-lost authority by cracking down on the Christians' main
militia, sought to extend it to Moslem sectors of the divided
country by blockading illegal militia-run ports that had deprived
the government of tax revenue.
   The Moslem Druse militia, led by warlord Walid Jumblatt,
retaliated by shelling the Christian zone.
   The Syrians, the main power brokers in Lebanon, came to the aid
of their leftist allies, throwing their military might against the
Christians.
   Aoun, who has long demanded the withdrawal of the Syrians and
the troops they maintain in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate, declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive the
Syrians out.
   On the face of it, it is an unwinnable contest. Aoun's motives
for taking on the Syrians and their allies, who outgun and
outnumber the Christians beleaguered in their shrunken heartland,
are not clear.
   But his objective appears to be to force the Syrians into open
war and draw international attention to a conflict that has raged
for so long it is hardly noticed.
   The Arab League has tried to intervene, but its efforts to find
a solution so far have borne little fruit and few expect it to make
headway.
   The French, to whom the francophile Christians have
traditionally turned for help, the Soviets and other European
powers are pressing the Syrians to reach an accomodation with Aoun.
   President Hafez Assad of Syria cannot be seen to be humbled by
pulling out of a country he considers part of Syria's orbit.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has served notice that
Washington plans no new initiative in Lebanon.
   The United States is still haunted by the deaths of more than
240 Marines killed by a Shiite Moslem suicide bomber and other
failures.
   The fate of 15 Western hostages, nine of them American, held by
pro-Iranian Shiite extremists may be behind the U.S. reluctance to
get involved in the Lebanese quicksands again.

   Morton Downey Jr. found the shouting
distasteful, Phil Donahue settled upon an epitaph _ ``occasionally
he went too far'' _ and Geraldo Rivera proclaimed that the real
Geraldo is three different men, Winchell, Murrow and Merv.
   And Larry King, while wanting no part of their style or
substance, defended their right to be kinky.
   The occasion was a raucous, 90-minute debate Wednesday pitting
the four talk-show stars against luminaries in the print media over
what constitutes responsible journalism and good taste. The
videotaped show, for airing over public television, opened the
annual meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   A semi-subdued Downey got outshouted and didn't smoke a single
cigarette. Rivera went nose-to-nose with his critics, unbloodied
this time, and Donahue, who once dressed in drag for a show on
transvestites, didn't skirt the issue.
   King rejected the notion that anyone should be reined in. ``It's
a big pie,'' said the USA Today columnist and Mutual Radio and CNN
television talk-show host. ``Geraldo's producers may decide they
want to do a lot of sex on their programs, or they want to do
things that may be kinky. Suppose they do that? So what?
   ``I don't have to watch,'' King said. ``We each set out to do
our programs. Same with newspapers. There's the New York Daily News
and The New York Times and the New York Post, and the Wichita
paper, and USA Today. And all the Americans have is choice.''
   The program was produced and moderated by former CBS News chief
Fred W. Friendly, now with Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism.
   He started the fireworks by showing an excerpt from a program
Rivera did on sex surrogates, and telling his former student: ``It
seems to me that what you're concentrating on is that `kinky'
business.''
   Rivera: ``I do lots of different programs. ... You are talking
about 10 percent of what I do.''
   Friendly: ``Mr. Rivera, I looked at a hundred of your programs.
I could have run a hundred of them and made the same point.''
   ``What are you, Mr. Rivera?'' Friendly asked.
   ``I'm a compassionate man,'' said Rivera.
   Q: ``Who are your role models?
   A: ``There's a lot of (Walter) Winchell in what I do. There's
also Edward R. Murrow, and Merv Griffin.''
   Friendly: ``That's quite a combination.''
   Jack Nelson, Washington bureau chief of The Los Angeles Times,
snapped that Rivera and the others are ``more show biz than you are
journalists.''
   Rivera shot back: ``This is arrogant. This is hypocrisy.'' He
demanded to know how much of the criticism of so-called trash
television ``is based on pure parochialism? How much of it is based
on the fact that I am your competition?''
   Nelson: ``I don't think you're a journalist.''
   Donahue: ``Explain the difference.''
   Nelson: ``Well, I go out and I try to find out what I can that I
think is important for society to know, for society to act on ...
   Downey: ``You're a snob.''
   Tom Shales, television critic for The Washington Post, said
``We're not talking about what's journalism and what's not
journalism. We're talking about what's good taste and what's bad
taste, what's good manners and what's bad manners. And I think
television now is overrun with bad taste and bad manners.''
   The audience was shown another excerpt, from Downey's program,
in which a young member of the audience challenged the host's views
on prison furloughs by noting that ``one of the central tenets of
Christianity is forgiveness.''
   Downey was shown retorting that ``Let me tell you something.
More people have been killed in the name of Jesus. ... They've all
been killed by guys like you.'' Downey and the young man wound up
screaming ``Murderer!'' at one another 10 times over. Downey
concluded the segment by raising his arm and inviting the youth to
``suck my armpit.''
   Friendly: ``Did you really give that young man a chance to be
heard?''
   Downey: ``Absolutely. What am I supposed to do, write bland
headlines on the 17th page of a newspaper?''
   Downey said he is ``an advocate, not a host. ... I was raised in
the generation of rock 'n' roll. And we heard the lyrics over the
music. The older folks here don't seem to be able to hear the
lyrics.''
   Nelson said ``the most reprehensible thing I see on any of these
programs is Mort Downey smoking his cigarette on television. ...
   Downey, who couldn't smoke during the show because of rules
governing the hall, replied ``that's the mentality of the
super-liberal.''
   King: ``If Morton Downey wishes to commit suicide, that is his
prerogative.''
   Downey, to Nelson: ``You'd love for me to drop dead, because it
would be sensational for your newspaper.''
   The capacity audience of about 500 newspaper publishers and
executives also viewed the ``Donahue'' segment in which he donned a
skirt.
   Friendly taunted him about that, noting he once admired Donahue
for the way he handled shows earlier in his career. ``People have
come to see you as a role model, and now you're making a fool of
yourself,'' said Friendly.
   Donahue replied that ``I do not apologize for wanting to draw a
crowd. I'm as interested in ratings as the people in the room are
interested in circulation.'' He added ``I cannot be the BBC. Part
of my job is to attract an MTV (Music Television) audience.''
   Besides, said Donahue, ``I think it's a pretty good epitaph for
somebody: `Occasionally, he went too far.'''
   Toward the end, virtually all the panelists were trying to be
heard over each other. ``I find it extremely distasteful,'' said
Downey, ``to listen to shouting.''
   Friendly, in a not-so-veiled reference to a ``Geraldo'' episode,
said ``I can't break people's noses to stop them.''

<HEAD>Kennedy, Waxman Renew Plan to Give All Workers Health Insurance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy says his legislation to
require employers to provide health insurance for workers has a
better chance for passage this year because the plight of the 37
million uninsured has received so much attention.
   ``My sense is the country is prepared to come to grips on
this,'' the Massachusetts Democrat said Wednesday. ``There's a
great deal of anxiety among the American people.''
   Last year, legislation sponsored by Kennedy in the Senate and
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., in the House was met with strong
opposition in the business community and went nowhere. The Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee, which Kennedy chairs, approved
the measure, but it never got to the floor. In the House, it never
got out of committee.
   Kennedy and Waxman announced new legislation on Wednesday that
builds on last year's bill, incorporating provisions requiring
employers to provide health insurance for workers and phasing in an
expansion of the Medicaid program to cover the non-working poor.
   The measure, they say, will provide health insurance to all
Americans by 1999.
   Kennedy estimated the federal cost of the Medicaid expansion at
about $5 billion over 10 years, and states would have to match the
federal contribution. Businesses would face about $18 billion in
new costs, but subsidies and lower-cost insurance pools would be
available to help small businesses.
   Benefits would be essentially the same as the basic package
employers would be required to offer, including physician services,
hospital services, diagnostic tests, pregnancy and well-baby care
and a limited mental health benefit, under the measure.
   The measure has been endorsed by 100 organizations representing
organized labor, health care providers, women, consumers and
religious groups. However, businesses are expected to oppose the
bill, as they did last year.
   An estimated 24 million of the Americans without health
insurance are members of working families and would be covered
under the Kennedy-Waxman bill. Employers would be required to
provide the basic package of benefits to employees working more
than 17{ hours per week and to their families.
   The bill sets limits on co-payments, deductibles and the
employee share of the premiums and provides coverage for
catastrophic illness. It also would not allow anyone to be denied
insurance because of an existing medical condition.
   Addressing some of the concerns that were raised last year,
Kennedy rejected arguments that it would hurt businesses
economically and the country competitively.
   ``In fact, the legislation will help, not harm, American
businesses in world markets,'' he said. Most of the manufacturing
companies involved in international trade already provide insurance
for their workers, but ``these businesses pay too much for health
insurance because others pay too little,'' he said.
   Waxman added: ``What we need to do is spread the cost of
covering workers across all employers, and spread the risk of
illness fairly among insurance companies.''
   For those not eligible for job-based insurance, the Medicaid
program would be expanded gradually, beginning in 1991 with the 6
million uninsured poor Americans not now eligible for the
federal-state insurance program.
   The second phase would begin in 1996 and include the near poor,
whose income are within 185 percent of the poverty line. These
people would pay a share of the cost of their coverage.
   A final phase would begin in 1999 to cover the remaining
uninsured.

   Abbie Hoffman, a Chicago Seven radical who
founded the Yippie movement of the 1960s and wrote ``Revolution for
the Hell of It'' and ``Steal This Book,'' died Wednesday. He was 52.
   Hoffman rose to prominence with the Chicago Seven, a group of
radicals who stood trial on charges of conspiring to disrupt the
bloody 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
   The others of the Seven were Thomas Hayden, Jerry Rubin, David
Dellinger, Reynard C. Davis, Lee Weiner and John Froines.
   The 4{-month-long trial's theatrics featured wild-haired
defendants and a 74-year-old judge Julius Hoffman who ordered Bobby
Seale, a former Black Panther leader, bound and gagged in the
courtroom.
   Hoffman started the loosely organized Yippie movement, or Youth
International Party, in 1968 to bring together radicals to protest
the government and the Vietnam War.
   In addition to his earlier writings, he wrote ``Square Dancing
in the Ice Age: Underground Writings'' in 1982. His memoirs, ``Soon
to Be a Major Motion Picture,'' were published in 1980.

   A bill that would give more teeth to the
Consumer Product Safety Commission and let it do business at less
than full strength is making progress in a House committee but
faces business opposition.
   The bill, sent to the Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday
by a subcommittee, would specify a quorum of two when there are
only three members on the commission. It has the support of major
consumer groups.
   Currently, the commission has five authorized members and the
quorum is three. In recent years Congress has appropriated money
for only three salaries, so when there is a vacancy _ as there has
been since January _ the two remaining members can do nothing.
   Some Republicans on the commerce, consumer protection and
competitiveness subcommittee sought to sidetrack the bill,
sponsored by Chairman James Florio, D-N.J., in favor of an
amendment providing straightforward renewal of existing authority.
   ``This bill is opposed by every business group that has
commented on it,'' said Rep. Howard C. Nielson, R-Utah, sponsor of
the amendment, which was defeated 7-4 before the subcommittee's
voice-vote approval of Florio's measure.
   Nielson said Florio's bill was too cumbersome and had little
chance of passage.
   The bill would also:
   _Let consumers petition the commission for safety rules and
would require decisions on them within 120 days.
   _Let state attorneys general and certain other state officials
duplicate federal lawsuits brought by the commission.
   _Require reports, studies or decisions about the flammability of
sleepwear used by the elderly, standards for reclining chairs,
safety of cigarette lighters, indoor air pollution and age
requirements for operators of amusement park rides.
   A similar bill was approved by the subcommittee and the parent
committee last year, but action was too late in the session for
consideration by the House.
   The commission has been operating on year-to-year authority
granted in appropriations bills since 1983.
   Nielson said deaths from products under the commission's
jurisdiction fell from 26,000 in 1975 to 22,000 in 1984, and ``the
per capita decline has been more dramatic'' because the population
has grown. ``I don't think there is any evidence the commission is
not doing its job,'' he said.
   Supporting Florio, Rep. James C. Slattery, D-Kan., said, ``For
those people who don't think we need a vigorous CPSC, they ought to
spend an hour in a Toys 'R Us store with a child.''

<HEAD>Activist Says Harvest too Poor to Support Exports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer advocate says the outlook for the
1989 harvest is so grim that the government should suspend export
subsidies despite their popularity with wheat farmers.
   Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of the private, non-profit
Community Nutrition Institute, said Wednesday he wrote Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter on April 3 to repeat a similar request
made last fall, ``when the situation was less precarious'' and
steps ``could have been taken to safeguard supplies.''
   The institute studies nutrition and food policy issues.
   The target of Leonard's complaint is the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP, which subsidizes the sale of wheat and other
commodities to selected foreign countries. Huge sales of wheat to
China and the Soviet Union have been made under the program since
the arrangement was authorized by Congress in the 1985 farm law.
   Subsidies at one time ranged to more than $40 per metric ton, or
approximately $1.09 per bushel, from less than $20 per ton, or
about 54 cents per bushel. Lately, reflecting generally higher
world prices, the subsidies have been even lower, with shipments to
China recently carrying EEP subsidies of $6.33 per ton, or 17 cents
per bushel.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Yeutter said this week the program had helped significantly in
getting agricultural trade discussions moving under the current
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   But Yeutter also said in an interview with a group of reporters
on Monday that the subsidy program would be reviewed to see how
effective it has been and whether ``too much or too little'' is
being spent on it.
   Leonard said that the condition of the winter wheat crop is
deteriorating and that experts in the Agriculture Department and in
the major production areas point to a harvest this year of about
1.6 billion bushels. A spring wheat output of 600 million bushels
would make a total U.S. wheat harvest of about 2.2 billion bushels.
   If wheat use in the 1989-90 marketing year, which will begin
June 1, totals in the range of 2.4 billion to 2.5 billion bushels,
this year's harvest would fall short of meeting demand.
   In that case, Leonard said in his letter to Yeutter, at least
200 million bushels of wheat will have to be drawn from existing
stocks, which are estimated by the Agriculture Department to be
drawn down to 549 million bushels by June 1.
   Thus, he said, the U.S. wheat stockpile by June 1, 1990, could
well be down to around 300 million bushels. According to department
records, that would be the the smallest U.S. wheat reserve at the
end of a marketing year since 1952, when it was 256 million bushels.
   ``This is hardly adequate as a domestic reserve, and will leave
the U.S. unable to intervene if famine conditions develop anywhere
in the world,'' Leonard said. ``The (United Nations) Food and
Agriculture Organization ... a month ago said that world grain
stocks will be drawn down again in 1989-90 for the third year in a
row.''
   Leonard added: ``In effect, FAO does not expect food grain
production to increase significantly in any of the major
food-producing areas outside the U.S.''
   The department's first official estimate of 1989 winter wheat
production, which usually accounts for three-fourths of the U.S.
total, will be released May 11.
   Meanwhile, department analysts have used unofficial projections
showing that the 1989 wheat harvest could be as low as 2.3 billion
bushels, or slightly more than Leonard's benchmark.
   The biggest problem is in major areas of the Great Plains,
particularly in Kansas, the No. 1 wheat producer, where soils have
been parched since the crop was planted last fall.
   Yeutter is scheduled to tour some of the Kansas wheat area on
Friday, his office said. There has been congressional pressure on
the department to extend 1988 drought relief to the stricken winter
wheat farmers.

   New projections by the Agriculture Department
show the European Economic Community continues to push grain
exports aggressively, with shipments expected to be at a record
level this year.
   An analysis released Wednesday by the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service said EEC exports of wheat and coarse grains
such as barley and corn are expected to total 33.3 million metric
tons in 1988-89, up 39 percent from 23.9 million tons last year.
   The international trade years begin on July 1 for wheat and Oct.
1 for coarse grains. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is
equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans, or 39.5 bushels of corn.
   Wheat exports by the EEC are at a record 21 million tons, up
from 15.3 million in 1987-88.
   But the coarse grains, mostly barley, also have also grown,
forecast at 12.3 million tons against only 8.6 million tons last
year.
   ``Over the past seven years, subsidized barley exports by the
EEC have jumped by 150 percent,'' the report said. ``While EEC
barley exports comprised less than 30 percent of world barley trade
as recently as the early 1980s, their share is now almost 60
percent, a growth in exports that has come at least partially at
the expense of U.S. coarse grain market share.''
   The United States, the world's leading grain exporter, was
forecast to have total wheat and coarse grain shipments of 103.4
million tons in the current trade years, up from 96.9 million tons
in 1987-88, a 7 percent increase.

   Maoist Shining Path guerrillas armed with
guns and machetes killed 12 peasants in an Andean village where
municipal officials had arrested three rebels, authorities said.
   In other violence, rebel assassins shot to death a leader of the
governing party's youth organization as he boarded a bus in this
highland capital, according to police.
   Abilio Fernandez, prefect of Junin state, told The Associated
Press that a band of Shining Path insurgents on Wednesday rounded
up 12 people in the town square of Chongos Alto, a hamlet of 100
peasant families 20 miles southwest of Huancayo, the Junin capital.
   He said the rebels killed the peasants by shooting them or
hacking them with machetes in apparent retaliation for the recent
capture of three Shining Path guerrillas by village officials.
   Police blamed the Shining Path for the assassination Tuesday of
Juan Torres, head of the Huancayo branch of the Peruvian Aprista
Youth.
   They said two gunmen had surprised Torres, 21, shooting him in
the head at a bus stop near his home in Huancayo, which is 140
miles east of Lima.
   The Shining Path has slain dozens of officials from the
center-left Aprista Party in its nine-year insurgency to topple the
elected government and impose Marxist rule.
   Huancayo, one of the nation's most important provincial
commercial centers, has become of major focus of insurgency
violence over the past three years.
   The government blames the Shining Path for more than 15,000
deaths. The guerrilla movement opposes Soviet and Chinese communism
and has no known ties to any other rebel group.

   President Bush's proposal to ban campaign
contributions by political action committees is one of those offers
that sounds great: politicians forgoing money in the name of good
government.
   And ``special interest'' money at that, as the political action
committees have become known.
   His motive, however, is probably not so pure. The fact is,
Bush's proposal reflects the growing recognition among Republicans
that the system of contributions by political action committees has
backfired on the party.
   It is primarily congressional incumbents who are benefiting from
the PAC contributions. And because more incumbents are Democrats
than Republicans, Democrats are getting the bigger share of the
money.
   Bush proposed doing away with the PAC contributions _ in effect,
doing away with the PACs _ at a meeting of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors in Washington on Wednesday. He offered the
suggestion as he released a broader ethics package designed to
tighten rules for Congress, judges and the executive branch.
   ``PACs weaken the parties, restrain competition and deaden the
political debate,'' Bush said.
   Political action committees are one of the products of the
post-Watergate campaign reforms, and are a prime example of the law
of unintended consequences.
   They are a multimillion-dollar enterprise that virtually no one
is happy with. Critics say they skew the political system in favor
of the narrow interests they represent and make incumbents even
harder to dislodge from office.
   The PACs are committees organized around officers and employees
of corporations, businesses, trade associations and the like, whose
members make contributions that are collected together and donated
to candidates.
   Republicans originally saw the PACs as a business-oriented,
Republican answer to the contributions Democrats were getting from
labor unions.
   As the amounts of money have grown in politics, so have the
PACs. In the 1988 election cycle, according to the Federal Election
Commission, PACs contributed more than $151 million to House and
Senate candidates. A decade earlier, their contributions totaled
one-fifth that.
   With their growth, however, has come an unmistakable trend. The
PAC managers increasingly have decided that rather than providing
campaign contributions to challengers with whom they might share
some views, and who often are badly in need of money, they'd rather
put their money on the candidate who is more likely to win.
   In nearly all cases, that's an incumbent.
   And the PACs tend to favor the committee chairmen and
subcommittee chairmen, who are entrenched in office and have power
over their areas of interest.
   In 1988, incumbents got $118 million of the PAC contributions.
Challengers got less than $19 million. The rest went to candidates
for open seats.
   For Democratic candidates for the House and Senate, PACs made
close to $99 million in contributions. For Republicans, there was
less than $61 million.
   PACs can give up to $5,000 per election to a candidate, but can
spend unlimited amounts on their own in a candidate's behalf.
   And who were the top recipients last year? In the House, it was
Democrat Richard Gephardt, one of the presidential hopefuls and
hardly an endangered candidate in his House re-election battle. In
the Senate, it was Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee who easily won re-election to the Senate.
   Doing away with PACs has support among Democrats, too. But many
Democrats want to do so as part of a bigger move to public
financing of congressional campaigns, just as the presidential
general election campaign is financed with taxpayer money.
   Bush said he opposed public financing.
   Many Republicans have been advocating an alternative that would
be more to their liking. Instead of providing public financing,
they would strengthen the role of the parties by lifting the limits
on individual contributions to the political parties.
   Individuals can now give no more than $1,000 per election to a
candidate. But they can give $20,000 annually to a party, and
advocates of this plan would like to see even larger amounts.
   Bush didn't add that idea to his proposal to the editors, but he
suggested it.
   ``Modern democratic government works best when organized by
strong political parties, and yet we have allowed our parties to
become weakened and overshadowed by special interests,'' Bush said.
``And we can best restore the role of the parties by limiting
political action committees.''
   Small wonder he would want to see more influence for the
parties. Contributions to the Republican Party and its House and
Senate campaign committees regularly dwarf those going to the
Democratic counterparts. The Republicans easily raise four or five
times what the Democrats raise in this type of contribution, and
the Republicans had a $100 million lead over the Democrats in 1984.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Says She's Doing Fine After Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush says she feels fine after a
radioactive thyroid treatment and will continue life as usual
except that she can't hold her grandchildren or puppies in her lap
or kiss anyone for 72 hours.
   Looking fit after a reception with the Queen of Sweden, Mrs.
Bush told reporters Wednesday, ``I feel wonderful.'
   That morning the first lady underwent a common procedure for her
recently diagnosed Graves disease. She drank a radioactive iodine
solution to deactivate her thyroid gland, which was producing
excess levels of hormones.
   Talking to a handful of reporters after standing in a half-hour
receiving line and speaking at the reception, she complained that
news coverage of her health was overshadowing the issues she wanted
to focus on, such as Queen's Silvia's work on behalf of the
disabled.
   ``Will you stop it?'' she implored the reporters.
   She jokingly pretended to be infirm, staggering up to the
reporters and leaning on the arm of her press secretary. Then she
told the group, ``I could Indian wrestle any one of you to the
ground.''
   She said she swam a mile Thursday and Monday and played tennis
on Wednesday, and hoped to keep exercising to keep off the 21
pounds that the disease had caused her to lose.
   In reference to the weight loss, she said, ``I like half of my
disease. In fact I love half of it.''
   She said she had wanted to wear an eye patch or arrive in a
wheelchair just to tweak the press, but her press secretary nixed
the prank.
   During a two-hour visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Mrs.
Bush sipped the radioactive solution through a straw, and said it
tasted like water.
   She also had her eyes examined and they were found to have no
damage from the disease, which had caused some eye irritation, she
said.
   Her condition can cause the eyes to keep opening and water, ``so
it looks weird,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   She anticipates no aftereffects from the radiation treatment,
except an eventual slight neck pain, she said. The doctors also
told her not to hold her dog's new puppies or her 11 grandchildren
for 72 hours, because their thyroids are small and more susceptible
to any effects of radiation.
   Mrs. Bush said doctors led her to believe that was just a
precaution and may have been ``almost an old wives tale.''
   The Bushes canceled a weekend trip to Kennebunkport, Maine, but
aides said it was unrelated to Mrs. Bush's condition, resulting
instead from visits by family members to Washington this weekend,
as well as the president's desire to stick around while budget
talks are nearing conclusion with Congress.
   Mrs. Bush's press secretary Anna Perez said the first lady joked
throughout her visit to the hospital.
   After the radiation treatment takes effect and deactivates her
thyroid gland, probably in two to three months, Mrs. Bush will have
to take daily medication to maintain adequate hormone levels, said
Ms. Perez.
   For several weeks, Mrs. Bush has been taking methimazole to
block production of excess hormones and will continue to take it
until blood levels of thyroid hormones fall below normal levels.
   She then will switch to a thyroid hormone replacement
supplement, Ms. Perez said.

   The nation's space agency will be led for the
first time by ``a hero of its own making,'' President Bush said in
announcing he will nominate astronaut Richard Truly as
administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The nomination, which had been expected, must be confirmed by
the Senate.
   Truly, 50, has been an astronaut since 1969, was pilot of the
second shuttle flight in 1981 and commander of the eighth in 1983
and has been associate NASA administrator for space flight since
1986.
   Truly succeeds James C. Fletcher, a former NASA administrator
who resumed the position after the Challenger disaster in January
1986. Fletcher retired this month.
   ``This marks the first time in its distinguished history that
NASA will be led by a hero of its own making, an astronaut who has
been to space,'' Bush told members of Congress and others in the
Roosevelt Room of the White House on Wednesday.
   Bush also announced that he plans to nominate James R. Thompson
Jr., director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala., to succeed Dale D. Myers as deputy administrator.
   Before his space flights, Truly was pilot for one of the two-man
crews that conducted landing tests with the space shuttle
Enterprise when it was hauled aloft on the back of a 747 jumbo jet.
   He was commissioned an ensign in the Navy in 1959, became a
naval aviator in 1960 and made more than 300 carrier landings. He
now holds the rank of rear admiral.
   After the Challenger disaster Jan. 28, 1986, Truly was in charge
of the recovery team and of redesigning the shuttle's boosters and
overhauling the shuttle safety program.
   B. Jay Cooper, deputy White House press secretary, said Congress
had agreed to waive a requirement that the head of NASA be a
civilian.
   Bush said that immediately after the ceremonial announcement,
Truly was leaving for Cape Canaveral to take charge of the flight
readiness team for the next space shuttle flight, in which the
shuttle Atlantis will carry the Magellan radar mapping device into
space.
   Truly, asked after the ceremony what his top priority would be,
said, ``To have a good flight readiness and get Magellan on its way
to Venus.''

<HEAD>Death Penalty no Deterrent to Drug Dealers, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA M. HAMM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's
suggestion that prosecutors seek the death penalty in some
drug-related murders in the District of Columbia is ``ridiculous,''
the chief of the trial division of the Public Defenders Service
says.
   The death penalty would not deter drug dealers from pursuing
their lucrative but dangerous business, Mark Rochon said Wednesday.
   ``These guys are running around with death contracts on them and
they are still out hustling,'' Rochon said. ``The fact of the
matter is, these are people who have chosen to go into a
violence-prone way of living. And they (federal officials) think
two or three deaths a year is going to deter them? It would be
funny if it weren't so ridiculous.''
   A record 372 persons were killed in the city in 1988, and police
have said 80 percent of the deaths were drug-related. The district
is headed for another record total in 1989.
   Thornburgh on Monday said U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens has the
power to identify cases for federal prosecution under the new death
penalty statute enacted last fall as part of the 1988 Anti-Drug
Abuse Act. The bill allows the death penalty for the murder of a
law enforcement officer during narcotics trafficking and for
homicides committed by ``drug kingpins.''
   Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Walt Ferguson said
Police Chief Maurice Turner Jr., who in the past has expressed
support for the death penalty, is ``in the process of reviewing
statutes and other ins and outs of the legislation.''
   The D.C. Council struck the death penalty law from the city's
criminal code in 1980, joining 13 other states that forbid capital
punishment.
   Stephens said the death penalty would be employed in the
district ``only after very careful scrutiny and review.'' The
Justice Department is developing guidelines to screen cases in
which the death penalty might be sought, he said.

<TEXT>
   A homeless man was charged Wednesday with
nine counts of murder after telling police he set a fire that swept
through an apartment house, killing seven children and two young
mothers, a prosecutor said.
   Joe Pickens, 34, who has no permanent address, was charged in
the Tuesday fire, the deadliest in the history of this central
Illinois city of about 130,000 people, said Peoria County State's
Attorney Kevin Lyons.
   Pickens was charged with criminal trespass, a misdemeanor, just
hours after fire.
   But Lyons said murder charges were lodged after Pickens
confessed to setting fire to a sleeper-sofa on the first floor,
igniting a fast-moving fire that swept up a stairwell to the second
floor where three families slept.
   ``Initially he claimed the fire was set accidentally,'' said
Police Chief Allen Andrews. ``He subsequently admitted he had
deliberately set the fire.''
   Following Pickens' brief court appearance, Circuit Judge Robert
Barnes set bond at $2 million and scheduled a hearing for May 5.
   Authorities said Pickens had been arrested several times on
misdemeanor vagrancy and criminal damage to property charges in
recent years.
   Pickens should have been in jail at the time the fire was set,
but had ignored a judge's order March 31 to begin serving a 30-day
sentence for resisting arrest _ his 22nd misdemeanor conviction
since 1983, the Peoria Journal-Star reported in Thursday's edition.
   Claudie Garner, who lives across the street from the burned
building, said she knew Pickens ``pretty well.''
   ``He'd get violent when he was under the influence of alcohol,''
she said. ``Otherwise he was a nice fellow.''
   Andrews said after Pickens set the fire, he went to the police
station and asked officers whether there were any outstanding
warrants for his arrest. After being told there were none, Pickens
simply left, Andrews said.
   Fire Chief G. John Parker had said Pickens apparently stayed at
the two-story wood-frame home in the past and ``was put out of the
house (Monday night), but he came back.''
   Parker said he did not know why Pickens had been forced to
leave, but said Pickens is believed to have left at 11 or 11:30
p.m. Monday, returned later and remained in the first-floor
apartment. The fire was reported at 2:20 a.m.
   The apartment had recently been vacated by Joyce Barnes, one of
three survivors of the blaze, and a daughter who died in the fire.
Authorities believe Ms. Barnes had moved in with the families
upstairs.
   ``Mr. Pickens made a statement that he set a fire downstairs and
we believe the evidence shows the facts are consistent with that
... and that he was aware residents were inside,'' Lyons said.
   Fire Department spokesman Greg Joos said a preliminary
investigation revealed the fire began near a space heater on the
first floor. He said electrical service in the downstairs apartment
had been shut off, but gas service was not. Joos also said the
landlord told authorities he had no idea that three families
apparently were living in the building.
   Joos said hard-wired smoke detectors had been installed on both
floors, but that Carl Wells, 29, who survived the blaze by climbing
on the roof with two others, said he did not hear an alarm.
   A memorial service was held for the victims at a community
center.
   And counseling was made available to children at the elementary
school attended by several of the children killed in the fire, and
similar help would be offered to firefighters.
   ``Traditionally, these are pretty macho guys and they may not
seem outwardly affected. But a few were really hurt by hearing
screaming kids and not being able to help,'' he said.
   Coroner Herbert Buzbee said the nine victims died of smoke
inhalation.
   The victims were Terry Davis, 27, and three of her children,
Arnisha Davis, 7, Karlissa Davis, 2, and Tanoa Davis, 10; Davis'
sister, Wanda Hobbs, 20, and her children, Felicia Hobbs, 4, and
Ashley Hobbs, 1; and Eugene Roberts Jr., two months; and Jacolby
Thomas, 2, the daughter of 30-year-old Ms. Barnes, who survived.
   Barnes and 14-year-old Eric Davis, son of Terry Davis, were in
fair condition at Franciscan Medical Center in Rock Island.

<HEAD>Protests Convulse Guyana's Capital Over Austerity Measures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three hundred department store workers
were fired for their one-day walkout in support of a two-week-old
strike by bauxite and sugar workers who are protesting
government-mandated austerity measures.
   The measures imposed on this English-speaking country of 750,000
on the northeast coast of South America included a 230 percent
devaluation of Guyana's dollar and the doubling of interest rates
to 35 percent.
   The measures were adopted by the government of President Desmond
Hoyte to meet conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for
a $1.9 billion aid package to revive the country's economy, which
hasn't grown in 10 years.
   Fourteen protesters, including two Jesuit priests jailed Tuesday
for picketing outside Parliament buildings, were released Wednesday
by police. The arrests brought to 100 the number of people jailed
for demonstrating against the measures since Hoyte announced them
on March 31.
   While there has been no violence in the protests, about 300
department store workers who paralyzed the capital's commercial
sector by staging a one-day walkout Tuesday were fired when they
returned to work Wednesday, authorities said.
   The strike by 5,000 bauxite workers, 20,000 sugar workers and
800 university employees, including professors, entered its second
week. Sugar and bauxite, which is used to make aluminum, are among
the country's main exports.
   Government spokesman Christopher Nascimento said union leaders
calling for strikes were hurting themselves because ``in attempting
to bring the economy to a halt, they will not hurt the government
but the nation as a whole.''
   With the measures, Guyana's dollar officially fell to 33 to the
U.S. dollar, although it fetches up to 50 to a U.S. dollar in the
black market.
   Prices, already high before the measures, have soared. A loaf of
bread costs about $5.
   The government tried to offset the devaluation with a 20 percent
wage increase but union leaders say that will not make a difference
in workers' paychecks.

   The prosecution portrayed Oliver North as
working in a ``den of thieves'' while North defended President
Reagan's advisers as ``honorable men,'' even as they desperately
tried to cover up the Iran-Contra affair.
   Describing the frantic hours of Nov. 21, 1986, North testified
Wednesday that he witnessed his boss, national security adviser
John Poindexter, rip a presidential finding in two. The finding
retroactively legalized a CIA-assisted November 1985 weapons
shipment to Iran.
   ``Did you ever think, `I'm in a den of thieves?''' prosecutor
John Keker asked North, who was on the witness stand in his
criminal trial for a fifth day.
   ``No, Mr. Keker. ... I never regarded that I was working in a
den of thieves,'' replied North. ``I honestly believed I was
working for honorable men who were trying to do their level best
... to make this country a better place.''
   The same day that Poindexter tore up the finding, North's
ex-boss, Robert McFarlane, reminded him to alter six memos to hide
McFarlane's and, North thought, Reagan's knowledge of North's
secret assistance to the Contras. North made the alterations, a
year after McFarlane had first asked him to do so.
   ``At any time on Nov. 21, 1986 did you think ... what you had
been asked to do might be wrong?'' said Keker.
   ``No,'' North said, ``not for one fleeting moment.''
   North said what McFarlane ``wanted removed from the documents
was language that would indicate his knowledge or the president's
knowledge about my activities in this time frame.''
   The previous day, North, Poindexter, CIA director William Casey
and others went over proposed congressional testimony which denied
any U.S. knowledge of the November 1985 arms shipment to Iran until
1986. North said nearly everyone at the meeting knew that to be
false.
   A few days earlier, McFarlane had changed a chronology of the
Iran arms sales by omitting all references to the November 1985
shipment, according to North.
   North contended that the deception was necessary to protect the
lives of U.S. hostages held in Iran. The Iranians were unhappy with
the Hawk missiles in the shipment sent through Israel and
disclosing the U.S. connection could result in retribution, North
testified.
   Told by Poindexter that the attorney general, at Reagan's
request, was launching a fact-finding inquiry into the Iran arms
sales, North on Nov. 21, 1986, engaged in extensive document
shredding.
   ``Did you begin destroying everything you could get your hands
on?'' Keker asked.
   ``I left 80 boxes'' of documents behind, retorted North. ``I did
not try to destroy everything I could get my hands on.''
   His former secretary, Fawn Hall, has testified that North
destroyed more than a year's worth of computer messages that day.
North testified that in the previous month, he started to ``clean
up'' at the request of CIA director William Casey.
   North said he destroyed records tracking secret assistance to
the Contras and the diversion of funds to the rebels from the Iran
arms sales. He also got rid of a ledger showing how he had spent
$300,000 kept in his office safe. He now is accused of converting
$4,300 of that money to his own use.
   The finding Poindexter had torn up described the 1985 shipment
of Hawk missiles to Iran as a straight arms-for-hostages swap. The
December 1985 presidential finding authorizing it was a potential
political disaster for a president who had vowed never to negotiate
with terrorists.
   North said he had been placed in an impossible position.
   Reagan's top advisers wouldn't allow the finding justifying the
1985 Hawk shipment to become public because it ``was a political
embarrassment,'' he said. ``They were leaving a heckuva pickle for
the people'' left behind to explain the arms transfer, which
without the finding was probably illegal.
   North is accused of 12 criminal charges, including shredding and
altering documents in November 1986 and creating a false chronology
about the November 1985 Hawk shipment.

<HEAD>Administration Moves to Replace Head of Social Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government sources say the Bush administration
may replace Social Security Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy, a Reagan
appointee whose travel and hiring records are being scrutinized by
congressional critics.
   Sources in the Bush administration and on Capitol Hill said
Wednesday that the administration is seriously considering
replacing Hardy with Gwendolyn King, a former legislative aide to
Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa. King has also headed the Washington office
of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh when he was governor of
Pennsylvania.
   None of the sources would be identified by name.
   Reached at the government relations firm of Gogol &amp; Associates,
where she is executive vice president, King said: ``I will be
pleased to serve wherever the president needs me.'' She declined to
discuss the Social Security post.
   Hardy, 42, worked for Ronald Reagan on welfare issues when he
was governor of California, and was a health and human services
assistant secretary during his first presidential term before being
named to run Social Security in 1986.
   Although Bush took office Jan. 20, Hardy has not yet been told
whether she will be retained, according to agency spokesman Phil
Gambino.
   Like all political appointees from the Reagan administration,
she was asked to submit her resignation after Bush became
president, ``but it has not been accepted,'' Gambino said.
   As the administration deliberates on a successor, a House panel
has been looking both into Hardy's travel and her hiring of a
handful of former political appointees as consultants.
   It was not clear whether the investigation was a factor in the
administration's decision to seek a replacement for Hardy.
   In the last three weeks, Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan has received two letters from a House Government
Operations subcommittee as part of an inquiry into whether Hardy
combined business trips with vacations or political travel. The
subcommittee declined to release the letters.
   Hardy declined several requests to be interviewed.
   However, Gambino said: ``In the 13 years since I've been here,
three other commissioners have been asked for travel information.
It's not unusual.''
   He said Hardy's job frequently required travel, and not always
in the United States. Last summer, for example, he said Hardy was
asked by the State Department to brief officials in China on
America's Social Security system, and that she stopped in Hawaii
for 24 hours as a ``natural progression.''
   HHS has turned down a few trips proposed by Hardy, according to
Tom Burke, a private consultant who was chief of staff under former
Secretary Otis R. Bowen. However, Burke said: ``Lots of people got
their trips turned down. We just questioned the need for them.
She's not at the top of the list.''
   The subcommittee has also been looking at four or five SSA
employees who were immediately rehired as consultants by Hardy
after the administration asked them to step down because they were
political appointees.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., the subcommittee chairman, has been a
frequent critic of Hardy. Most recently, he accused the Social
Security agency in December of failing to speedily implement a law
requiring it to help homeless people receive benefit checks.
   Hardy's efforts to trim the agency through computerization and
staff cuts brought periodic protests from Capitol Hill. Lawmakers
have expressed concern about the cuts in view of the increased
caseloads brought on by new tax and immigration laws.
   On Monday, Hardy's program to implement a national telephone
number to field Social Security questions was criticized by two
federal employee groups, which said she created ``sweatshop
conditions'' for workers and was insensitive to callers' needs.
   Hardy said the system was still being smoothed out and that it
would ultimately make the agency more accessible to millions of
Americans. She has said automation may be trying for some
employees, but that it makes the agency more efficient.

   Politicians battling to regain the public's trust

saying: The next step ahead is darkness.
   Never in the Liberal Democratic Party's 34-year rule has the
popularity of its leader fallen so low, and never have so many of
its elite been accused of dirty dealing.
   But in the crisis, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita is displaying
a surprising ability to survive.
   Takeshita, 65, has rejected opposition demands to step down, and
top Liberal Democrats refuse to submit former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone to questioning under oath in Parliament.
   Instead, they have focused on bringing about ethical reforms and
resuming deliberations on the fiscal 1989 budget. The opposition
has boycotted the budget talks since March 8.
   That battle will come to a head later this month, when fiscal
deadlines must be met, but party Secretary-General Shintaro Abe
already has suggested the conservatives will use their majority in
both houses to simply force the budget through _ a move bound to
spark criticism in consensus-conscious Japan.
   ``Very few members of the ruling party say Takeshita should be
dumped before the budget is passed,'' said analyst Asao Yamaguchi.
``But afterward, the wind will blow in the other direction.''
   Yamaguchi said that by unilaterally passing the budget,
Takeshita would be left with no other political choice than to
dissolve the lower house and call elections this summer, when
polling for half the seats in the upper house is scheduled. A loss
at the polls then would likely end his administration.
   Behind the conservatives' dilemma is the Recruit Co., a huge
publishing conglomerate. Recruit sold unlisted shares in a
real-estate subsidiary to about 160 political, business and
government officials at low prices in 1986. The buyers received
handsome profits when the shares soared in value shortly after they
were listed on the market.
   In all, 14 people have been arrested on bribery and other
charges and three Takeshita-appointed Cabinet ministers have
resigned in connection with the scandal.
   Along with Takeshita, Abe and Nakasone, former Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa and Michio Watanabe, pegged as a future party
leader, all have been implicated in Recruit share transactions.
   On Tuesday, Takeshita went before a special session of the lower
house Budget Committee to acknowledge that from 1985 to 1987, he
received about $1 million in donations from Recruit and its
subsidiaries.
   The admission was an attempt to clear his name _ he claimed the
donations were all legal _ and was hailed by party leaders.
   But Takeshita, whose support in recent public opinion polls has
fallen below 10 percent, faces other problems.
   His pet project, a controversial new 3 percent sales tax, went
into effect April 1, raising consumer prices in a nation that
already has one of the world's highest costs of living.
Liberalization of agricultural imports has alienated some farmers,
one of the conservatives' main support groups.
   ``There are many voices within the party calling for the top
leader to be replaced,'' said Keiichiro Nakamura, a former aide to
the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki.
   Nakamura told The Associated Press the critics are still a
minority, but ``with elections this summer drawing near, more and
more members of the party are realizing that with Takeshita as
their leader, they will not be able to be re-elected.''
   He said Takeshita's successor must be Recruit-clean, and, with
heads of major factions linked to the scandal, the most likely
candidate is Masayoshi Ito, 75, chairman of the party's Executive
Council.
   Other analysts speculate that former Prime Minister Takeo
Fukuda, 84, whose protege is Abe, may succeed Takeshita. Even
Takeshita mentor Shin Kanemaru, 74, has been mentioned as a
possible heir.
   All are thought of as interim prime ministers who would hold the
reins only until a new, younger leader could be found.
   ``This is the most important political crossroads since the end
of World War II,'' said Takako Doi, head of the largest opposition
party, the Socialists.
   But opposition parties are far apart on policy and they also
have been tarred by the Recruit scandal.
   The former head of the Democratic Socialist Party said he would
not seek re-election after being linked to the affair; a Socialist
legislator has resigned; and a former deputy secretary-general of
the Komeito, or Clean Government Party, has acknowledged his
brother bought shares.
   There is speculation that rebels might leave the Liberal
Democrats and form a new party. One restive group of party hawks,
headed by legislator Shizuka Kamei, has demanded the resignation of
all politicians who received Recruit funds.
   But analyst Yamaguchi said such a breakaway would never happen.
``It takes money to form a new party, and very few people are
willing to contribute in times like these,'' he said.

   Members of the House hunger committee say
they're concerned a lack of trucks, planes and barges will keep
emergency famine-relief supplies from reaching hundreds of
thousands of starving Sudanese caught in the African country's
civil war.
   Four members of the House Select Committee on Hunger recently
returned from a trip to Africa, where they said agreements were
reached to deliver food and other supplies into the southern part
of Sudan.
   ``We've gotten people to agree, and we're back here and we don't
know that those agreements are going to hold up,'' said Rep. Gary
Ackerman, D-N.Y. ``There are not enough trucks in that whole
country; there aren't enough trucks in the neighboring countries.
There aren't enough planes. There is enough food.''
   Members of the delegation said the goal is to deliver 170,000
metric tons of food before the rainy season begins in mid-May and
makes the roads impassable.
   Rep. Mickey Leland, a Houston Democrat and chairman of the
committee, said the delegation is also ``concerned that more
nations, the usual members of the donor community, have not come
forth to aide the Sudanese people through the United Nations.''
   Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo., pointed to Japan and Western Europe
for not being as forthcoming as the United States.
   ``I am puzzled as to why the countries of Western Europe ... and
Japan have also not gotten on board,'' Emerson told a news
conference Wednesday.
   Ackerman said he was ``embarrassed that the other nations we
share this planet with, our allies, our competitors, our friends,
who certainly have a great deal of largesse, have not been as
forthcoming as we have.''
   Shingo Yamagami, press officer for the Japanese Embassy, said:
``It's not true that we're not doing anything about it.''
   Yamagami cited decisions to provide relief totaling $1.08
million on March 28, followed by another $3.08 million announced
Tuesday. Last year, Japan provided $3.85 million in food to Sudan,
and gave $77.7 million in economic assistance in 1987.
   Ella Krucoff, a spokeswoman for the European Community, also
disputed the congressmen's charges, saying: ``There's no question
the community has given all kinds of aid, including emergency aid.''
   The EC on Wednesday announced an ``action program'' of $132
million to cover food and relief needs from April through December.
Over the last 15 months, the EC gave more than $47 million in aid
to southern Sudan, while individual countries gave another $30
million-plus last year, Krukoff said.
   The United States has pledged $30 million in aid, in addition to
$70 million it has already spent this year, while also arranging
for an additional $10 million in a food swap, Leland said.
   Ackerman also attacked the United Nations' relief efforts in
Sudan. The UN has selected UNICEF to act as the lead agency to
coordinate food and logistics.
   ``The United Nations ... has been asleep at the switch in
Sudan,'' Ackerman said. ``Their operation there ... is basically
smoke and mirrors. They're interested in the facade, rather than
the facts. Their operations, which are great in other places, are
sorely lacking there, where it's as much show businesses as
anything else.''
   Maie Ayoub, information officer for emergencies at UNICEF,
called ``Operation Lifeline Sudan'' a huge challenge. But she said
the United Nations had successfully negotiated for safe passage of
more than 100,000 metric tons of food through eight ``corridors of
tranquility'' in war zones.
   Leland said as many as 2.5 million Sudanese are at risk _ those
in southern Sudan, displaced southern Sudanese now living in the
north, and as many as 400,000 refugees living in neighboring
Ethiopia.

<HEAD>IRS Boosts Phone-Line Staff for Filing Deadline Crunch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If you are among the millions of taxpayers
delaying the inevitable, the Internal Revenue Service is offering a
little extra help to get you through the final weekend of the tax
filing season.
   The agency is making many of its employees available extra hours
on Saturday and Monday _ the filing deadline _ to answer calls on
its toll-free telephone lines. The lines will be open five hours on
Saturday and an extra two hours, until 7 p.m., on Monday.
   In addition, IRS offices nationwide that offer assistance to
taxpayers who walk in will not close Monday night until the last
customer has been served.
   The IRS is expecting more than 25 million returns _ out of the
109 million due this year _ to be filed during the 16 days ending
Monday night, and the agency is cautioning procrastinators against
careless errors.
   ``Being careful now can help you avoid common mistakes made in a
last-minute rush which could delay processing your return or hold
up your refund,'' the agency said Wednesday.
   Such careless mistakes have shown up on hundreds of thousands of
returns already this year. The most common: failing to sign the
return; non-itemizers neglecting to claim a standard deduction;
students failing to state whether they can be claimed as a
dependent by a parent; writing down the wrong tax liability from
the tax tables, and basic mathematical mistakes.
   In some cases, such as errors in math, IRS computers catch the
mistakes and correct them. Others, such as failing to sign the
return, require an exchange of letters between IRS and taxpayer
before the return can be processed and a refund mailed.
   The IRS anticipates that about 6 million couples and individuals
will avoid the last-minute rush by taking an automatic four-month
extension of the filing deadline. That option is available by
filing a Form 4868.
   However, that only delays filing, not paying any tax due. The
form must be accompanied by a check for the estimated tax due.
   Through Friday, the IRS had received almost 64.7 million
returns. That is 0.3 percent above the 64.5 million received during
the same period a year ago.
   Almost 53.3 million returns have been processed this year, up
almost 1 percent. The inventory of unprocessed returns is 11.4
million, compared with 11.7 million last year. Many in that
inventory are those that do not qualify for a refund; the IRS
processes refund returns first to avoid paying interest on late
refunds.
   So far this season, the IRS has certified 42.1 million refunds,
up 1.8 percent from almost 41.4 million at this time in 1988. This
year's refunds have totaled $34.7 billion, compared with $34.3
billion last year. The average refund is $824, down from $830 last
year.
   In addition to offering extra hours for telephone assistance
this weekend, the IRS said programs that use volunteers to help the
elderly and others fill out returns will stay open late. Locations
of the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Tax Counseling for the
Elderly projects are available by calling the IRS toll-free
telephone number.
   Those numbers are listed in the instructions that accompany
individual tax forms, as are separate numbers for the Tele-Tax
system.
   The Tele-Tax number also is the one to call for information on a
refund, if you filed a return at least eight weeks ago and have not
yet received a refund.

<HEAD>Guard Computers Like `Missiles Without Guidance Systems'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computers purchased by the National Guard
under a 1986 contract remain useless because they lack the
necessary software and probably won't be in full working order
until 1991, a House subcommittee was told.
   The Army National Guard Bureau bought 119 Unisys 5000
minicomputers, about 5,000 terminals and hundreds of printers and
other equipment but failed to obtain the programs, data and other
routines, investigators told the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on oversight and investigations.
   The bureau opted for the Unisys system, believing that their
Burroughs 1900s system would be obsolete by 1986. But Guard units
in 54 states and territories are still using the Burroughs 1900s.
   Lt. Gen. Herbert R. Temple Jr., chief of the National Guard
Bureau, and Maj. Gen. Donald Burdick, director of the Army National
Guard, estimated Wednesday that the first software package should
be ready by April 1990 and the Unisys system should be operating by
1991.
   ``Validation of software systems is currently under way,''
Temple and Burdick said in a joint statement. ``It is our intention
to fully utilize this equipment.''
   Meanwhile, the computers remain idle with the staff occasionally
opening boxes to see if they still run or using them ``for games
like tick-tack-toe,'' said Richard Chervenak, a subcommittee
investigator who visited eight states that purchased the computers.
   ``In military terms, this would be analogous to buying missiles
without guidance systems, troop carriers that do not protect troops
and attack helicopters without engines,'' said Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House subcommittee.
   Staff investigators from the subcommittee, who have been looking
since July 1988 into allegations of irregularities, testified that
some states have threatened to develop their own software for the
Unisys computers. The Bureau's Information Management Agency warned
against that step, expressing concerns about possible
incompatibilty of the locally developed software and the software
being developed for the system.
   ``Computer experts in the Army have told us that it is
unthinkable to purchase computer hardware without knowing that the
software in available,'' Chervenak said. ``They stated that the
federal government purchases computers and software routinely and
could not understand how the bureau could make such a fundamental
mistake.''
   Dingell said the investigation found no irregularities by Unisys
but numerous problems with the bureau's handling of the
procurement, including misuse of an expedited contract and probable
violations of procurement regulations.
   According to estimates, the Guard will spend between $30 million
and $40 million to replace its computer system, Dingell said.
   Dingell said that Guard and state officials told subcommittee
staff that Fred Trent, a civilian employee of the bureau, was
largely to blame for the procurement irregularities. But Trent died
in 1986, more than a year before the Guard purchased the computers.
   ``In addition to being reprehensible, blaming the dead for one's
own mistakes fits an all too familiar Pentagon pattern,'' Dingell
said. ``For example, blaming the pilots shot down in the raid on
Libya for bombing the French Embassy there.''

<HEAD>Disabled-Rights Groups Say Bush Broke Campaign Promise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After being courted by President Bush in last
fall's campaign, groups representing disabled Americans are angry
at the administration's appeal of a court ruling requiring
wheelchair lifts on new buses.
   The accusations that Bush broke campaign promises are prompted
by the administration's request this week that an appellate court
review its Feb. 13 ruling that mandated installation of wheelchair
lifts on new buses bought with federal money
   ``Most of us feel as if he has sold us out, that we were used,''
said Marca Bristo, president of the Chicago-based National Council
on Independent Living. ``This was an opportunity for him to take a
clear and decisive leadership role on probably the most passionate
issue that faces the disabled community _ public transportation.''
   Advocacy groups for the disabled say the legal maneuver doesn't
square with Bush's campaign rhetoric and his State of the Union
pronouncement that handicapped people ``belong in the economic
mainstream.''
   ``We need your talents in America's workforce. Disabled
Americans must become full partners in America's opportunity
society,'' Bush said during his address to Congress on Feb. 9.
   Disabled rights lobbyists say Bush won many votes by endorsing
legislation last fall that would do exactly what the court decision
mandates _ require that wheelchair lifts be installed in buses
purchased by local transit companies with federal funds.
   The request for a rehearing of the ruling by the full 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia was filed Monday despite
pleas to Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and White House
Counsel Boyden Gray by the disabled-rights groups at meetings last
week.
   Gray was described as sympathetic and Skinner promised on Friday
to review the appeal, which was originally planned to be filed that
day, Bristo said.
   Skinner told the group that he was not concerned about the cost
of installing wheelchair lifts as much as court interference with
his agency's discretion in promulgating regulations.
   The petition for rehearing also was submitted despite
recommendations by three federal agencies _ the National Council on
the Handicapped, the President's Committee on Employment of People
with Disabilities and the U.S. Architectural and Transportation
Barriers Compliance Board.
   In a Feb. 27 letter to Bush, the chairman of the employment
advisory committee, Harold Russell, told the president that the
court ruling ``would be entirely consistent'' with his stated goal
of helping disabled Americans get more job opportunities.
   Tim Cook, an attorney with the National Disability Action
Center, which is representing the plaintiffs in the bus lawsuit,
said that ``for the administration to now renege on that promise
and seek to overturn this case is not being well accepted by the
disability community.''
   The 3rd Circuit set aside regulations that allowed local transit
to demand 24-hour notice from the handicapped that special services
would be needed. It also struck down a provision of the regulation
that said transit authorities would be considered in compliance
with disability rights policy if they spent 3 percent of their
operating expenses on improving access for the handicapped.
   The decision was seen by disabled people as a landmark ruling in
their quest for access to public transportation, Cook said.
   ``The major reason that people with disabilities are unemployed
is the lack of lack of decent public transportation,'' Cook said.
``If you can't get to the job or the training you are going to sit
at home.''
   Spokesmen for the White House and the Transportation Department
did not return telephone calls on the subject Wednesday.
   The administration's legal brief filed by the Justice Department
contended that the 3rd Circuit decision would cost local transit
authorities $270 million a year to provide wheelchair lifts on
buses.
   The Justice Department contends that federal laws ``do not
require this wholesale restructuring of mass transit services or
the imposition of the attendant financial burdens on an already
overburdened public transportation system.''
   It also said such policy decisions should be left to the
Transportation Department, not made by the courts.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers facing the loss of military bases in
their home states claim a federal commission's list of
installations recommended for closure should be rejected because it
is based on erroneous information.
   ``The commission's report and recommendations are flawed,'' Rep.
Ed Madigan, R-Ill., said Wednesday during consideration of a House
resolution to disapprove the suggestions of the Commission on Base
Realignment and Closure.
   The panel recommended last December closing 86 bases, partly
closing five others and changing the mission of 54 other
installations at an estimated savings of $694 million a year, with
20-year savings estimated at $5.6 billion.
   Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci approved the
recommendations and the House Armed Services Committee voted 43-4
to support the commission's decision.
   The full House, which is scheduled to vote on the resolution
next Tuesday, is expected to follow the committee's action.
According to law, the commission's recommendations must be accepted
in their entirety, and if the resolution of disapproval fails, the
plan will go into effect next month. Base closings will then begin
in 1990.
   ``I hear the pain of many members whose bases will be closed in
their districts,'' said Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., as debate got
under way on the House floor. ``That is the bill the House voted
for,'' she said, referring to the legislation setting up the
commission.
   Representatives from New Jersey, Illinois and California as well
as other states acknowledged that they will likely lose the fight
but expressed concerns over the commission's methodology and its
recommendations.
   Congressmen cited a General Accounting Office report released
Wednesday that found that the commission ``may have made its
recommendations for realignments and closures based on incomplete
and inaccurate data.''
   The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, said the commission used
erroneous data in its analysis of Army training centers, including
Fort Dix in New Jersey. The agency also found errors in the data
and weaknesses in the methodology in the analysis of Air Force
technical training bases, including Chanute Air Force Base in
Illinois.
   But Frank Conahan of the GAO said that ``some of the data used
by the commission that had been questioned were, in fact, correct.''
   ``I need to emphasize that the issues I have discussed and
questions I have raised about the commission's work are not
intended at this point to imply disagreement with the commission's
overall conclusions,'' Conahan said.
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., said he found it ``highly
disturbing that the GAO office, in findings released today, used
faulty information.''
   Rep. Jim Courter, R-N.J., said most of the savings cited by the
commission would come from reductions in troop strength. In
addition, the commission's decision to close a number of bases,
including Fort Dix in New Jersey, was based on ``incorrect
information and clerical error,'' he contended.
   Madigan said no member of the commission or its staff visited
the Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois, and charged that the panel
made its decision based on ``inaccurate information and will not
achieve the allege cost savings.''

   The marriage of Lou and Suzan Allgayer got
off to a rolling start.
   The couple, co-managers and now co-owners of the Flying Wheels
Roller Skating Center, tied the knot at the rink Tuesday night
while wearing roller skates.
   The 48-year-old bride, dressed in a skating skirt
custom-designed for the wedding, rolled to the middle of the rink
towing her 71-year-old father, Charles Buckley, who had strapped on
skates for the first time in 15 years.
   Waiting at the candlelit altar were Lou, 55, the attendants and
the Rev. Tom Sahl _ all wearing skates.
   The wedding party stood on carpet strips as Sahl conducted the
ceremony so ``we wouldn't roll around so much,'' said the minister,
a novice skater.
   After Sahl pronounced them married, the couple celebrated their
third marriage each by skating arm-and-arm around the rink.

   A $400 gift of stock to a tiny schoolhouse
a quarter century ago has swelled to $16,000, providing all nine
pupils at the school with swimming lessons, a computer and a
microscope, among other things.
   ``Without it, we wouldn't have a lot of enrichment,'' said
Sandra Goodermote, principal and one of two teachers at the
four-room elementary school and kindergarten in the town of 140
people in northwestern Massachusetts near the Vermont border.
   The fund was set up in 1963 by a local businessman, Paul
Hodgdon, who donated 200 shares of stock in the Deerfield Glassine
Co.
   The mill has since closed, Hodgdon has died and the stock has
been sold, but the fund, which earns more than $1,000 yearly in a
bank account, lives on in the videocassette recorder, trips to
Boston and other educational frills it continues to buy for the
53-year-old schoolhouse, which also serves as the town hall and
library.
   Monroe was founded in 1822 along the Deerfield River, which
attracted the paper mill that made glassine windows for envelopes
until it closed in 1984. The mill was the only industry in the town.

   Police raided a U.S.-registered yacht
in this southern port and found 570 pounds of Miami-bound cocaine _
Chile's largest seizure of the narcotic, a police general said
today.
   Two Colombians and an Ecuadoran were arrested in the raid late
Wednesday in the port 350 miles south of Santiago after residents
tipped off officials that those aboard were spending large amounts
of money in town, police said.
   Police Gen. Rene Varas said the drug cache found aboard the
Florida-registered Marco Polo has a street value of $160 million.
He said it was Chile's largest cocaine seizure.
   Among those arrested was the yacht's owner and skipper, a
Colombian who police identified as Miguel Eduardo Taylor, 41.
   The boat arrived from Colombia and was scheduled to leave
Thursday or Friday for Miami, said Varas.
   Among the world's largest cocaine busts was the seizure of
22,000 pounds of the drug in Colombia in March 1984.

<HEAD>Ambassador-designate Says Questionable German Exports Key Issue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's choice to be U.S. ambassador
to West Germany says a central point of his job will be pressing
the Bonn government to curb exports of chemical weapons and other
military technology to the Third World.
   Vernon Walters, praised by the Democratic and Republican members
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is certain of winning
confirmation from the full Senate, said Democratic Senator Joseph
Biden, chairman of the subcommittee on European affairs.
   ``One of the things the Germans look for ... is how well we
respect them by who we send them, and it's obvious (by the choice
of Walters that) we respect them a great deal,'' said Biden.
   ``I can think of no other relationship that is more important
today to the United States and to the West than the German-American
tie,'' Walters told the panel.
   ``The Federal Republic of Germany stands at the center of
East-West relations,'' he said. ``The West German public is the
main target of (Soviet) General Secretary Gorbachev's `charm
offensive' precisely because the Federal Republic is so important
to the alliance.''
   Recent U.S. differences with Bonn, such as problems over exports
and modernization of German-based U.S. nuclear missiles, are
inevitable in such a close relationship, he said.
   The differences ``reflect the very importance, variety and
intensity of our ties and our respective interests, rather than
fundamental differences,'' Walters said.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., cited West German press reports of a
range of sales of chemical, nuclear and missile technology to
countries such as Iraq and Libya.
   Helms, a sponsor of legislation that would impose sanctions on
German companies involved in the exports, said the West German
government had ignored U.S. diplomatic objections to the exports as
well as warnings from its own investigative agency.
   The United States has made more than 150 diplomatic
representations to the West German government over the past eight
years concerning ``improper exports'' to Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria
and South Asia, Helms said.
   ``Since all of these areas continue to receive German equipment
and technology in the face of our diplomatic efforts, I guess we
ought to be sort of ashamed of our diplomatic results,'' he said.
   ``This will be a central problem for me, senator,'' said
Walters. ``You have mentioned the unsuccessful representations. I
will do my best to see they are more successful in the future.''
   The senators from both parties took turns in praising Walters,
71, for his long career of government service, starting with the
Army in 1941. He rose to the rank of lieutenant general and served
directly under presidents starting with Harry Truman. He was an
interpreter for President Dwight Eisenhower on his foreign trips
during the 1950s.
   Biden said he would be the first U.S. ambassador in two decades
to go to Bonn being able to speak German. A linguist, Walters also
speaks French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch and Russian.
   His diplomatic posts have included being a military attache in
Italy, Brazil and France, and he was involved in negotiations with
the North Vietnamese and Chinese in Paris from 1969 to 1972.
   He has been U.S. ambassador to the United Nations since 1985.

<HEAD>Investigative Files Won't Save Impeached Judge, Lawmaker Declares</HEAD>

   Investigative files and other documents being
sought by impeached federal Judge Alcee L. Hastings from a
congressional panel contain nothing that will help him remain on
the bench, a key lawmaker says.
   ``He knows very well that we have no documents that exonerate
the defendant,'' Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, said Wednesday. ``If we
did, why on earth would we be here? We have had no desire to spend
the last three years working on this matter.''
   Hastings, 52, is accused of plotting to get a bribe in 1981 and
lying about it two years later before a jury that eventually
acquitted him.
   Impeachment articles that the House approved 413-3 on Aug. 3
also accuse him in an unrelated matter of improperly divulging
secret wiretap information.
   The Senate must now decide whether to remove him from the bench
and stop payment of his $89,500 salary.
   Bryant told a 12-member Senate committee reviewing evidence
against Hastings that it should reject a defense plea for documents
and a 180-day delay to allow for questioning a lengthy list of
potential witnesses, including U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
   Bryant said the House committee that prepared the impeachment
articles has already given the defense many documents and offered
access to others. He said it was unreasonable to demand ``every
single document we ever reviewed.''
   Rep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa., also urged the senators to head off
questioning of such potential witnesses as Rehnquist. ``We find
that all of this evidence, that none of it is relevant to the facts
that must be presented to this committee,'' Gekas said.
   Defense attorneys are trying to get government-paid expenses
totaling $200,000 plus fees that could add up to as much as
$750,000. House prosecutors have taken no position on that request.
   Hastings attorney Terence J. Anderson said that as a law
professor, he could afford to take the summer off to work on the
impeachment case. But he said that without government funding
co-counsel Patricia Williams would be ``committing economic
suicide'' to stay with the case to the neglect of her law practice.
   The panel's chairman, Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., told reporters
it would probably announce its decision on the requests later this
week. But Anderson said the mood of the senators appeared less than
encouraging.
   ``I felt an awful lot like the train is continuing to run down
the track,'' he said after the session.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., expressed misgivings about the
request for taxpayers funds to finance the legal battle.
   ``You're making an unprecedented request for compensation which,
just speaking for myself, I don't think you're going to have
available,'' he said.
   According to the defense, Hastings knew nothing of any plot.
   Washington attorney William Borders, a friend and one-time
classmate of Hastings, was convicted of conspiring to shake down
two defendants sentenced to prison by Hastings. The idea was that a
$150,000 payment would get the punishment changed to probation.
   Arrested after accepting a cash-stuffed garment bag from an
undercover agent, Borders eventually was sent to prison.
   Throughout the affair, however, Borders was merely ``blowing
smoke,'' according to Anderson. He says Hastings was simply not
involved.

   ``Best wishes for a speedy recovery,'' the wife of former
Democratic presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis wrote Mrs. Bush.
   A spokeswoman for the Massachusetts governor said Mrs. Dukakis
has always been fond of Mrs. Bush despite the political rivalry
between their spouses. Dukakis was particularly pleased, while
undergoing alcohol treatment recently, to receive a note of best

   Dan Quayle earned over $50,000 in speaking
fees as a member of the Senate last year before he accepted the
Republican vice presidential nomination.
   In so doing, Quayle got roughly $17,000 more than senators are
allowed to accept in speaking honoraria. But he gave the excess
fees to charity and deducted the contributions on his 1988 tax
form, thus complying with the honoraria limit.
   This transaction was made public Wednesday as Quayle's office
released his tax returns simultaneously with the White House's
release of President Bush's tax forms.
   Bush earned $155,662 last year from business holdings kept in a
blind trust, well above the $115,000 salary he drew from the
government as vice president. He and his wife, Barbara, reported an
adjusted gross income of $287,171.
   That was based on Bush's $155,662 in interest-and-dividend
earnings through partnerships and other interests, masked by the
blind trust, plus his government salary. Also included was $7,147
in other interest along with $12,362 in income from other sources,
primarily profits that Bush made from his partnership in a firm
that leased a liquefied natural gas transportation barge in
Louisiana.
   When his 1988 federal tax liability of $62,106 was deducted from
the $94,884 total in money withheld or prepaid, Bush had overpaid
by $32,778. White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he
applied $15,000 to next year's tax liability and kept the remaining
$17,778.
   Estimates on Bush's net worth have varied substantially,
although records show that the president, who made the bulk of his
money as an oil entrepreneur in Texas, has assets worth well over
$2 million.
   Fitzwater said he thought that reports of Bush's wealth ``are
vastly overestimated. Most of his net worth is in the Kennebunkport
(Maine) estate.''
   The Quayles, who records show hold assets worth more than $1.4
million, reported an adjusted gross income of $156,546 last year,
the bulk of that coming from Quayle's $89,500 Senate salary.
   Quayle listed charitable contributions totaling $17,304, or just
a little more than the $16,997 in speaking fees that he could not
keep for himself.
   The vice president's press secretary, Dave Beckwith, said Quayle
had written off the excess speaker's fees in an appropriate fashion.
   ``He earned more in honoraria than he's allowed to keep, so he
gave all the excess to charity,'' Beckwith said.
   The spokesman said Quayle gained no tax advantage by writing off
the extra speaking fees as charitable contributions, saying ``you
have (approximately) $17,000 more in income and $17,000 more in
deductions, so it's a wash.''
   Quayle earned all his speaking fees before August, when the
Republican Party nominated him to be Bush's vice presidential
running mate.
   The balance of his $156,546 income came from interest, dividends
and capital gains relating to his family's Central Newspapers, Inc.
Quayle also made $2,000 as a director of Central Newspapers _ a
position he would have to relinquish under ethics legislation that
Bush proposed to Congress Thursday.

   John Christian Warner, a chemist who played an
important role in developing the atomic bomb and who served as
president of the former Carnegie Institute of Technology for 15
years, has died at age 91.
   He died in his sleep Wednesday at the suburban retirement center
where he lived.
   Warner, who began his education in a one-room school in Indiana,
joined Carnegie Tech, now Carnegie-Mellon University, in 1926 as a
chemistry instructor.
   He was head of the chemistry department in 1938 and 1949 and
dean of graduate studies from 1945 to 1949.
   Warner became president of Carnegie Tech in 1950. His
administration pioneered the use of computers in education,
establishing a computation center in 1956 that helped the
institution gain national recognition as a center of research in
computer science.
   During the last two years of World War II, Warner worked on the
Manhattan Project, supervising research on the chemistry and
metallurgy of plutonium. He was on the general advisory committee
to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission for 12 years and also served
on the policy advisory board of the Argonne National Laboratory.
   Warner was technical assistant to the 1958 U.N. International
Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. He was chairman of
the organizing committee and first president of the Universities'
Research Association and designer, builder and operator of the
United States' most powerful particle accelerator in the Fermi
Laboratory in Batavia, Ill.
   He is survived by two sons, three grandchildren and four
great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Bush Veto Threat Debated After Senate Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The author of the Senate-passed bill to raise
the minimum wage says President Bush runs a high political risk
with voters by vetoing the measure, while Republicans say the
president must prove his ability to stand firm.
   ``I hope we still can reach agreement with the president,'' Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy said Wednesday night after his proposal to raise
the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 by October 1991 cleared
the Senate on a 62-37 vote.
   ``If that's not the case, we'll see the president and those who
support the president's position at the polls,'' said Kennedy,
D-Mass.
   There are some differences between the Kennedy bill and
legislation already passed by the House. A conference committee was
expected to be named today to draft a compromise.
   Kennedy, without being specific, said he was open to compromise
with the White House during the conference stage. But the prospects
for such an overture from Bush appear highly unlikely. Bush
repeatedly has said his proposal to raise the minimum wage to $4.25
by January 1992, rejected in both the House and the Senate, was his
last.
   ``I have it on pretty good authority that it's not going to be
higher than $4.25,'' said Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole,
husband of Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   The final bill could be considered as early as next week,
although no timetable has been set. The Democratic leadership has
the votes to win final passage, but Bush appears to have more than
enough votes to sustain a veto.
   Ten Republicans joined 52 Democrats in supporting the Senate
bill, while two Democrats and 35 Republicans voted against it. The
only senator not voting was Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.
   A renewed campaign to get the president to change his mind began
just after the vote.
   ``I urge the president to sign it when it reaches his desk,''
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said in a statement. ``A veto would
only compound the inequities faced by America's lowest-paid workers
who have gone eight years without a pay raise.''
   But Republicans, noting a number of other Democrat-sponsored
domestic programs likely to emerge from Congress over GOP
objections, said it was time for Bush to prove he will stand his
ground.
   ``Everyone knows the whole ballgame rests on the presidential
veto,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. He said few presidents have
had to control Congress through repeated vetoes but added, ``I
suspect this president is going to have to do that.''
   Under the Democrats' plan, the minimum wage, frozen at $3.35
since 1981, would rise to $3.85 on Oct.1, to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990,
and to $4.55 a year later.
   Bush has said he would veto any bill to raise the minimum wage
to more than $4.25 an hour and has insisted legislation must also
allow employers to pay all new workers a subminimum wage for up to
six months.
   Republicans argue the ``training wage'' is necessary to prevent
massive job losses they contend would be caused by the higher
minimum wage. Democrats have disputed the job-loss predictions, but
included in their measures a provision allowing employers to pay
some new workers a lower scale for up to two months.

<HEAD>Report Warns Of Massive AIDS Epidemic In Western Hemisphere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 2.5 million people in North and South
America already are infected with the AIDS virus, and some parts of
the hemisphere may be facing ``a massive epidemic,'' doctors warned
today.
   The researchers said the AIDS epidemic in some Latin and
Caribbean nations may become as bad as the outbreak in Africa,
although the severity will vary from country to country.
   Their concern, expressed in an editorial in today's New England
Journal of Medicine, is based in part on the apparent spread of the
disease from homosexuals to heterosexuals. This shift will put far
more people at risk of the deadly disease.
   The World Health Organization estimates that at least 5 million
people worldwide are infected with the virus and 350,000 have
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   In March 1987, a WHO report said 50 million to 100 million
people may be infected by 1991. But in December it reduced that to
6 million to 7 million because of evidence of behavioral changes
among high risk groups.
   Citing ``the best available data and with use of mathematical
models that incorporate the prolonged incubation period of AIDS,''
the editorial predicted that 500,000 people in the Western
Hemisphere are likely to be diagnosed with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome by 1992.
   ``We have great concern that we are starting to see a more
heterosexual pattern of spread emerging in these countries,'' said
Dr. Thomas C. Quinn, an AIDS expert at the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases who wrote the editorial with two
physicians from the Pan American Health Organization.
   ``Once it becomes an established heterosexual epidemic in those
countries, it has a potential for rapidly increasing in sheer
numbers, like in Africa.''
   A separate study in the journal, which described the level of
AIDS infection in Brazil, agreed with Quinn's concern.
   ``We are very fearful of the same situation,'' said the senior
author of that study, Dr. David D. Ho of Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles.
   In their editorial, the doctors warned, ``If HIV-1 infection
continues to penetrate the poor and less advantaged populations of
Latin America and the Caribbean, there is the potential for a
massive epidemic in the Americas that may parallel the situation in
Africa, where many cases remain unrecognized and unreported.''
   In Africa, the disease is spread primarily by heterosexual
intercourse and affects men and women in almost equal numbers. In
the United States, victims are largely male homosexuals and drug
abusers, and men outnumber women about 10 to 1.
   Quinn noted that the epidemic in most Latin and Caribbean
countries is far behind Africa's, but there are troubling signs it
will follow a similar course.
   Among these are the relatively high proportion of women victims
in some countries. The male to female ratio in French Guiana is 1.5
to 1; Hondurus, 1.7 to 1; Bahamas, 1.8 to 1, and Trinidad, 4 to 1.
   Quinn said poverty levels and a high frequency of prostitution
in some of the countries also may contribute to the transmission of
AIDS as a heterosexual disease.
   He noted that the disease is already well established in some
countries. In Haiti, 10 percent of pregnant women are infected, the
same as in some parts of Africa. There are 379 AIDS cases per
million people in the Bahamas and 350 per million in Bermuda,
compared with 71 per million in the United States.
   However, the epidemic will vary from country to country. He
predicted that in Chile, Bolivia and Argentina, among other
countries, the spread to heterosexuals will probably be slow, as it
as been in the United States.
   Quinn said the relatively large numbers of bisexual men in some
Latin countries appears to be hastening the spread of the disease
from homosexuals to heterosexuals. One of these is Brazil, where
Ho's study found that 28 percent of bisexual men and 23 percent of
homosexual men were infected with the AIDS virus.
   The study found that 9 percent of lower-class female street
walkers in Rio de Janeiro were infected, but none of middle-class
or upper-class prostitutes tested were.
   The researchers also found five people who were infected with
HIV-2, an apparently less virulent relative of the primary AIDS
virus that until now has been confined largely to West Africa.
   ``The second AIDS virus is spreading to this part of the world,
slowly but surely,'' Ho said.

<HEAD>Volume of Toxic Waste is Unexpectedly High, EPA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials expressed amazement that
U.S. industry released 22.5 billion pounds of toxic materials into
the air, water and ground in a single year, but they cautioned
against jumping to conclusions about the health effects.
   The Environmental Protection Agency released the toxic pollution
figures Wednesday after they had been submitted to the agency by
chemical companies, mining companies and other industries under a
new public disclosure law.
   The EPA acknowledged that not all the companies reported
discharges despite the threat of fines, and the law did not cover
smaller businesses such as gasoline service stations.
   ``The numbers are startling ... unacceptably high and far beyond
what we thought was occurring,'' Linda Fischer, assistant EPA
administrator for policy and planning, told reporters.
   At the same news conference, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said
``the numbers are staggering'' and provide clear evidence that
stronger emission controls are needed for industry.
   But EPA officials emphasized that the statistics represented
only raw numbers that have yet to be analyzed, and some expressed
uneasiness with releasing them altogether without further
interpretation.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly said in a statement that while
the raw figures indicate tighter pollution standards are needed in
some case, they do not prove in themselves that a public health
problem exists.
   ``Release does not equal exposure,'' said Reilly, noting that
the raw figures do not take into account rates of release,
concentrations or actual exposure to humans.
   ``It is likely that only a few facilities are exposing the
public to toxic chemicals at a rate that could require immediate
action,'' Reilly said.
   Nevertheless, the sheer volume of toxic substances, representing
more than 300 chemicals, including an assortment known to cause
cancer and other serious illnesses, took government officials by
surprise.
   The pollutants, released during 1987, broke down this way: 9.7
billion pounds of chemicals into streams and other bodies of water,
2.7 billion pounds into the air, 2.4 billion pounds into landfills,
3.2 billion pounds injected deep into the ground for disposal, 1.9
billion pounds shipped to municipal waste water treatment plants
and 2.6 billion pounds sent to off-site treatment and disposal
facilities.
   Although discharges into water accounted for by far the largest
volume of releases, EPA officials said 95 percent of those were of
sodium sulfate, a chemical the EPA already has determined does not
pose significant health risks or environmental harm and is expected
to be taken off the toxics list later this year.
   The remaining pollutants into water chiefly consist of chemicals
that are already regulated by EPA and states, the agency said.
   Only a small number of the toxic pollutants discharged into the
air are regulated by the EPA at this time, however. Such releases
of chemicals, including many that are carcinogenic, ``are still too
high'' and require changes in federal clean air laws, said Reilly.
   The largest volume of pollutants released into land come from
mining, said the EPA, which is developing tighter discharge
controls for mining wastes.
   Texas had the most overall pollutants, ranking first among the
states in air and land releases and either second or third in the
other categories. Louisiana also ranked among the top five states
in all categories, while California had the highest volume of
releases into water.
   While the total pounds of chemical releases were high, they did
not reflect all pollutants being discharged. The reporting
requirements cover only larger companies and not, for example,
gasoline stations, dry cleaners or other small likely polluters.
And as many as one-fourth of the companies required to report
discharges failed to do so despite the threat of a fine, officials
said.

<TEXT>
   The jumbo jet had been in the air for only 16
minutes when mayday came crackling over the radio from United
Flight 811 high over the Pacific: ``We've gotta come back ... We
had a bomb or something go off in the airplane ... trying to get
back to the airport.''
   So began 25 of the most harrowing minutes in the life of Capt.
David Cronin, his copilot, Al Salder and more than 300 other crew
and passengers aboard the United Airlines jetliner last Feb. 24.
   There was no bomb, although the pilots were all but certain one
had exploded. But a 10-foot hole had ripped open on the side of the
aircraft cabin, sweeping nine passengers to their deaths at 22,000
feet.
   A glimpse of the drama was provided Wednesday when the Federal
Aviation Administration released tapes of radio communications
between Flight 811 and air traffic controllers in Honolulu.
   For the most part Salder was believed to be at the microphone
with Cronin fighting to keep the hugh Boeing 747 jetliner aloft,
although FAA officials said it was unclear who was speaking during
certain exchanges.
   What was clear, however, is that more than once the pilots _ as
well as controllers monitoring and directing them _ feared the jet
would plunge into the Pacific. The pilots repeatedly sought to be
assured they were being tracked by radar so a rapid water rescue
mission could be launched if necessary.
   The jet, bound for Auckland, New Zealand with 354 people aboard,
was awaiting clearance to climb to a normal 30,000 feet cruising
altitude and was only 16 minutes out of Honolulu when the tragedy
struck.
   ``We're at, ah, mayday. We've gotta come back. We had a bomb or
something go off in the airplane. Ah, we're making a one-eighty
trying to get back to the airport,'' came the first emergency call
from the cockpit.
   Seconds later, the crew provided the first indication of the
seriousness of the problem.
   ``We don't know what's going on. Ah, looks like we've lost No. 3
engine and we're descending rapidly, ah, coming back,'' the pilot
reported.
   It would be another 25 minutes before the jumbo jet would be
resting in the middle of Runway 8 Left at the Honolulu airport and
the pilot reporting, ``United Eight Eleven heavy, We're evacuating
the airplane.''
   About six minutes after the incident began, Cronin apparently
had begun getting better control of the aircraft after descending
to 9,000 feet.
   ``It appears that we've, ah, we have lost No. 3 engine and we've
lost ... we're not getting full power out of No. 4. We're, ah, not
able to hold an altitude right now. We're dumping fuel, so I think
we're gonna be able to hold an altitude shortly,'' the pilots
reported as the crippled plane continue its limp to land with 60
miles still to go.
   The pilots remained convinced a bomb had gone off.
   ``It looks like we got a bomb, ah, that went off on the right
side, ah. The whole right side is gone,'' the copilot told
controllers as the jet was at 4,000 feet and descending. There now
was a fire in one engine and 45 miles still to go before any
opportunity to land.
   ``So, ah, you watch us,'' the pilot pleaded to controllers.
   ``United 811, I have you on radar,'' the controller assured the
crew.
   As the Boeing 747 flew closer to land, air traffic control began
to provide directions to line the jet up for an approach, but the
pilots still could not see the airport _ and that worried them.
   ``We should have the airport, but we don't,'' came the voice
from the cockpit.
   In the Honolulu tower, controllers were not sure the plane would
make it.
   A controller directed the Honolulu rescue center to hold a
helicopter on the ground for the time being, but prepared to fly.
   ``If you see (Flight 811) go down ... in the water or on land or
something then you can sent a helicopter right out there,'' the
unnamed controller advised the rescue center, breaking for a moment
away from directing Flight 811 in for a landing.
   ``OK. We've got the island in sight ... but we don't show the
airport,'' said the pilot as the struggling jet flew within 11
miles of the airport just under 4,000 feet in the air.
   The runway lights were turned up to full power and the
controller assured the pilots his radar showed them with enough
altitude to clear land.
   ``OK. We have the airport now,'' finally came word from the jet.
   Less than two minutes later the jumbo jet with the massive hole
on its side touched ground.
   ``United Eight Eleven heavy, we're evacuating the airplane,''
reported the pilot.
   The controller who guided the jetliner then described the scene:
   ``He's on the ground midfield ... everybody's jumping out of the

<HEAD>Rostropovich `Very Excited' About Conducting Tour of Homeland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet-born conductor Mstislav Rostropovich
says he is ``very excited and very nervous'' about leading a
concert tour of the National Symphony Orchestra in his homeland
after 15 years in exile.
   Rostropovich, 62, a renowned cello virtuoso who has been music
director of the National Symphony since 1977, wept at a Kennedy
Center news conference Wednesday as he announced plans for two
concerts in Moscow and two in Leningrad next February.
   ``This is the very, very exciting moment in my entire life,''
said Rostropovich, who fled the Soviet Union in 1974 with his wife,
soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, after growing harassment and
curtailment of their concert appearances by Soviet authorities.
   Rostropovich has not returned to the Soviet Union since, except
for a brief, unnoticed stopover at the Moscow airport a few years
ago. He maintains apartments in Washington and Paris, and travels
on a Swiss passport.
   The couple were stripped of their Soviet citizenship in 1978 for
``acts harmful to the prestige of the U.S.S.R.'' Their troubles
began when they befriended Soviet author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, a
human rights champion who also sought exile in the West.
   Soviet ambassador Yuri Dubinin hinted broadly that if
Rostropovich gave the signal, Soviet authorities would be willing
to begin the legal process toward restoring his citizenship.
Dubinin, tears streaming down his face, embraced Rostropovich after
the news conference.
   But Rostropovich sidestepped questions about his future plans.
Stephen Klein, executive director of the National Symphony, told
reporters it was highly unlikely that Rostropovich would seek to
regain his citizenship and return permanently to the Soviet Union.
   In an emotional speech at an orchestra rehearsal Wednesday
morning, Klein said, Rostropovich noted that many of his Soviet
contemporaries _ including composers Dmitri Shostakovich and Aram
Katchaturian, violinist David Oistrakh and pianist Emil Gilels _
had died since he left the Soviet Union.
   ``You have become my family,'' the conductor told his musicians.
   Rumors of an impending Soviet tour had circulated for months,
but the orchestra's 103 members had no confirmation until
Rostropovich broke the news Wednesday morning.
   Violinist Lev Pekarsky, formerly with the Moscow State Symphony
Orchestra, said his wife had received a letter from an aunt in
Moscow last week who wrote that a National Symphony tour was
disclosed in a brief article in a Soviet newspaper.
   Klein said he received formal word of the invitation from
Gosconcert, the Soviet performing arts agency, only on Monday.
   Rostropovich praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reform policies, and said Soviet artists are free to perform
anywhere in the West without restrictions.
   ``The Soviet people have so much more freedom, so much more
glasnost, than before Mr. Gorbachev,'' Rostropovich said. ``For
artistic freedom, there has been enormous change.''
   Dubinin said the tour will be ``a very, very important page for
his biography, for development of cultural exchanges ... and for
deep changes in our society and our relations with the United
States.''
   Rostropovich said his wife, a former Bolshoi Opera star, will
accompany him on the orchestra tour, which will begin in late
January with two weeks of concerts in Japan. Orchestra officials
said, however, that she probably will not sing during the tour.

<HEAD>House Authorizes Spending for International Affairs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has authorized the State Department
and other government international agencies to spend $4.6 billion
next fiscal year, $257 million less than President Bush wanted.
   The House, by a 338-87 vote, approved the measure Wednesday
authorizing a wide range of expenditures with cuts in many areas of
the administration's proposal.
   However, the amount is still $512 million more than fiscal 1989,
primarily because of:
   _restoration of U.S. contributions to the United Nations that
were withheld in 1985 as a way to pressure the U.N. for budget
reforms;
   _the expense of new U.N. peacekeeping efforts in the Persian
Gulf, Namibia and Angola;
   _construction of a new radio transmitter in Israel to improve
U.S. broadcasting to the Soviet Union; and
   _television Marti, a new broadcast service to Cuba.
   As an authorization bill, the measure does not directly result
in spending. In many cases, Congress does not appropriate the full
amounts authorized.
   The House voted $25 million for the National Endowment for
Democracy, an organization that awards grants to private
organizations to promote democracy and pluralism. That is $9.2
million more than Bush requested.
   An amendment offered by Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., would have
brought the amount down to the $15.8 million sought by the
administration, but failed on a 216-209 vote.
   The bill authorizes $412 million for migration and refugee
assistance, $32 million more than Bush wanted. The Foreign Affairs
Committee said it raised the amount because of a recent increase in
refugees, particularly from the Soviet Union and Southeast Asia.
   The bill also authorizes $100 million in additional funds for
fiscal 1989 to assist Soviet citizens moving to the United States
and for African and Southeast Asian refugees.
   The House approved an amendment to the measure that would
withhold the U.S. contribution to U.N. peacekeeping activity in
Angola unless all Cuban troops are withdrawn from that country
according to the stipulations of the Tripartite Agreement.
   The bill also authorizes $4.96 billion for 1991 for the State
Department and related agencies.
   Those agencies are the U.S. Information Agency, the Board for
International Broadcasting, the Inter-American Foundation and the
Asia Foundation.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. has yet to open its checkbook
despite promises by the giant energy company to atone for the
massive oil spill off Alaska's coast, Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan says.
   Lujan called in reporters Wednesday to complain about the lack
of progress in 10 days of negotiations aimed at getting Exxon to
pay $15 million in ``up front'' money to help assess the
environmental damage caused by the oil spill and plan for a
recovery.
   Asked whether he thought Exxon had lived up to its repeated
promises to do everything possible to rectify damages caused by the
Exxon Valdez tanker spill in Prince William Sound, Lujan replied:
``They have not yet because they haven't given us the $15 million
for the long-term assessment.''
   Lujan said Exxon lawyers ``are negotiating hard'' and ``trying
to get any advantage that they can.''
   Les Rogers, spokesman for Exxon Co. USA in Houston, said the
company was ``surprised'' and baffled about Lujan's complaints.
   ``There has never been any question that Exxon is willing to
appropriately fund the study,'' said Rogers, reading from a
prepared statement. ``Exxon offered to advance funds that may be
needed while discussions were ongoing.''
   Rogers said the negotiations, which involved three other
agencies in addition to Interior, were scheduled to continue.
   Steve Goldstein, the secretary's chief spokesman, said that
Lujan is concerned that the reluctance by Exxon to open its
checkbook, as reflected by these negotiations, ``will in many ways
dictate the approach that is going to be taken (by Exxon) in the
future.''
   ``He (Lujan) thought Exxon was going to come (to the
negotiations) with a check in their back pocket,'' said Goldstein.
   Government lawyers told Exxon attorneys they wanted $15 million
in advance for developing a long-term recovery plan and assessing
the extent of damage to wildlife, waterfowl and fish and public
lands. Eventually these costs, separate from the direct cleanup
costs, are likely to be ``in the tens of millions'' of dollars,
said Lujan.
   Lujan said the government wants to distribute $8 million
immediately to officials representing a number of government
agencies already working in Alaska and put the other $7 million in
reserve. He said one reason Exxon has balked is that the company
complained the money would not be earning interest if it is turned
over to the government in a lump sum.

<HEAD>Unusual Coelho Junk Bond Purchase Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Tony Coelho bought a $100,000 junk bond
three years ago through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and company
records said the purchase was made by the Democratic leader's
campaign committee, a published report says.
   During the same time he held the bonds, the California
congressman was chairman of the House Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, The Washington Post reported in today's
editions.
   The committee has received some of its largest donations from
Drexel's Political Action Committee and from indicted junk bond
pioneer Michael Milken, the Post said.
   Coelho also received speaking honoraria from Drexel in 1986 and
1987, the Post said. And Coelho had worked to prevent the closing
of Drexel's Beverly Hills office as part of an expected settlement
of a long civil fraud investigation of Milken and Drexel, according
to a Los Angeles Times story cited by the Post.
   But Coelho told the Post that at the time of the investment, he
didn't know Drexel was connected with the high-risk, high-yield
bond. He said it was recommended by a friend he declined to
identify.
   The issue was used to help finance the takeover of Beatrice
Foods by BCI Holdings.
   ``My decision to purchase the bond had nothing to do with
Drexel, Milken or an employee of Drexel,'' Coelho said.
   Coelho, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, said in the
letter he assumed the Drexel records listing his campaign as the
purchaser were the result of a ``computer error'' and he bought the
bonds with his own money.
   House rules forbid members to convert campaign funds for
personal uses.
   Drexel's list ``Coelho for Congress'' as the initial purchaser
of the funds on April 10, 1986, the Post said. The Post said the
purchase was generally available only to institutional investors
and regular customers of the Wall Street investment firm.
   According to Coelho's letter, the purchase was ``corrected'' and
his accountant sent Coelho's personal payment to Drexel three weeks
after the initial order date, the Post said.
   Coelho, the House majority whip, earned about $12,000 in
interest and profits during the six months he held the bonds,
according to his disclosure statement, the Post said.

<HEAD>Soviet Writer Finds Remains of Czar's Family, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A well-known Soviet screenwriter and former
policeman says he unearthed the remains of murdered Czar Nicholas
II and the czar's family a decade ago and wants to give them a
proper burial, the Moscow News reported.
   Geli Ryabov told the newspaper he was convinced he had found the
remains of the last of the Romanovs in a pit in Sverdlosk in the
Ural mountains by the number of corpses, the type of wounds and
dental prostheses he found.
   The bodies had been hidden to keep the burial place from
becoming a shrine for monarchist pilgrimages, Ryabov said.
   Moscow News published his account in its latest edition
Wednesday, along with a photo of a blackened skull the paper said
Ryabov identified as being that of Nicholas II.
   ``The conviction ripened in me that I must find out and tell
people the truth about the execution and burial of the Romanovs,''
Ryabov told the newspaper.
   In July 1918, soldiers acting on Bolshevik orders took Nicholas
and 10 others, including a 14-year-old boy and six women, into a
basement in a Sverdlosk house and shot them. Nicholas, born in
1868, was forced to abdicate in March 1917 as revolution swept
Russia.
   The Communists seized power in November 1917.
   Until now, Moscow News said, investigators assumed they could
not find the bodies because the remains were reportedly dropped
into a mineshaft where they dissolved under a layer of acid,
leaving only meager traces including buttons, some jewelry and a
cut-off human finger.
   But Ryabov said he embarked upon a personal quest to find the
true resting place of the murdered family. He first went to
Sverdlovsk, formerly known as Ekaterinburg, in 1976.
   Ryabov said he read everything ever written about the incident,
including investigators' reports, and even enlisted the aid of the
children of the commissar who oversaw the shootings, Yakov
Yurkovsky.
   He said his police experience helped lead him to a clue: certain
documents mentioned that the truck carrying the bodies got stuck in
a swamp at one point.
   ``And I decided to find that place,'' Ryabov told the Moscow
News.
   ``Ten years ago, when we uncovered the burial mound _ there's no
other word for the pit into which they had thrown the naked bodies
to lighten the truck _and even after that, I just couldn't publish
the results of my investigation,'' he told the newspaper. ``Those
weren't the right times.''
   In the franker atmosphere fostered by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's campaign for glasnost, or greater openness, wider room
has been allowed for discussing both current problems and some
darker epsiodes of Soviet history.
   In Ryabov's reconstruction of what happened, the Romanovs' faces
were beaten with rifle-butts to prevent identification and acid was
poured from ceramic jars to dissolve their features.
   The house where the shootings took place was destroyed in 1977
despite its historical significance, the newspaper said.
   Ryabov says he is prepared to submit his find to experts, but
only ``if permission is received for proper burial for the executed
befitting people and Christians.''
   Ryabov gave only a partial account of his find to the Moscow
News. His full story, titled ``We're Forced To Shoot You,'' is
scheduled to appear in the monthly journal Rodina, or Homeland,
this month.

<TEXT>
   Smugglers along the U.S.-Mexico border
have long had a macho image and been praised in song, but drug
rings involved in satanic killings are not part of the lore.
   ``Our smugglers do not pray to the devil,'' said Alma Rosa
Garza, a local secretary. She noted that the alleged leader of a
voodoo cult of drug smugglers that is blamed for at least 12 ritual
slayings was Cuban.
   Smuggling along the border involves drugs and illegal immigrants
going north; luxury and consumer goods and even industrial and farm
machinery comes the other way.
   And thousands of Americans come to Matamoros and nearby Reynosa
every night to drink, party or visit whorehouses. Nearly 22,000
visitors, many of them college students, come across daily during
college spring break.
   Among those visitors was Mark Kilroy, a pre-med student from the
University of Texas who disappeared during a nighttime trip with
friends to Matamoros.
   Kilroy was among those killed by smugglers who believed satanic
ritual would protect them from harm, authorities say.
   Mexican police say five people have been arrested in the case,
and authorities on both sides of the border were seeking the cult
``godfather,'' identified as Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, a Cuban
national in his late 40s.
   ``It was the strangest case involving drugs that I have seen in
my years as a newsman,'' said Edgardo Montiel, editorial director
of the Matamoros newspaper El Bravo.
   Violence is common in the border, he said, but not this kind of
violence.
   ``We are very concerned and we will tell the tourists that 99.9
percent of the people here are good and that it only takes one or
two to give the others a bad name,'' Ignacio Garcia, a shift
supervisor at Pancho Villa's restaurant, said Wednesday.
   Authorities were quick to say that the mass killing should not
alarm potential tourists.
   ``We do not believe there is any danger to people traveling to
Matamoros,'' said Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox.
   But this city on the Rio Grande near the southern tip of Texas
is widely known as a place where drug trafficking money buys
political power and legitimate businesses.
   Songs celebrate smugglers' courage in gunbattles with the law on
both sides of the border.
   The smugglers form a social group ranging from the gun-toting
river rat who carryies sacks of marijuana and packets of cocaine to
the big-time operator who runs tons of drugs and doubles as a
school benefactor and charitable figure.
   In almost every border town, from Matamoros to Tijuana on the
California border almost 2,000 miles to the west, their true
calling seems known to all.
   ``You can point them out,'' Matamoros Mayor Fernando Montemayor
said in an interview, ``but you can't prove anything. It is like
the Mafia in the United States.''
   The case ``is an alarm. ... Crazies like these are the product
of the drug traffic,'' said the mayor, who has closed down
expensive bars and restaurants where drugs were sold and also shut
down the red light district.
   Federal Prosecutor Jose Silva said some killings in the cult
case appeared to be more revenge murder than cult sacrifice. At
least two victims were former local police who had had some
connection with the Matamoros drug trade, according to federal
police.
   ``To me this is all part of the U.S. influence of total freedom
and excess. We Mexicans are more traditionalist, more conservative.
Rituals and drugs are a thing of the United States,'' said Rosa
Garza.

<HEAD>Former Brazilian Finance Minister Dead At 55</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dilson Domingos Funaro, the former
Brazilian finance minister who was instrumental in instituting
Brazil's debt moratorium in 1987, has died of lymphatic cancer. He
was 55.
   Funaro died Wednesday at Osvaldo Cruz Hospital in Sao Paulo,
said hospital supervisor Vera Tavares.
   Funaro, born in Sao Paulo, the nation's financial and industrial
center, was named head of the powerful Finance Ministry in August
1985 in the midst of Brazil's worst inflationary crisis.
   Internationally known for refusing to accept monitoring of the
Brazilian economy by the International Monetary Fund, Funaro
announced the 10-month moratorium on the nation's foreign debt
interest payments in February 1987.
   ``We aren't here to sacrifice ourselves and our economy to
maintain Citibank profits,'' Funaro told journalists shortly before
announcing the moratorium.
   Funaro was also a key player in launching the failed 1986
anti-inflation ``Cruzado Plan.'' The plan, which froze wages and
prices to combat rampant inflation, led to a consumer spending
spree that created serious shortages and a drop in exports and cash
reserves.
   After the freeze collapsed and inflation soared to an annual
rate of 500 percent, Funaro's popularity among politicians and
citizens fell. He stepped down from the post in March 1987.

<TEXT>
   Concern about possible intervention by Japan's
central bank pushed the U.S. dollar down slightly against the
Japanese yen Thursday, while the main index on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange also lost ground, traders said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained a
marginal 8.07 points Wednesday, lost 192.51 points, or 0.58
percent, to finish at 33,063.94. The index was higher in early
trading, but then declined.
   The dollar closed at 132.80 yen, down 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
132.85-yen finish. The currency opened higher at 133.03 yen and
ranged from 132.75 to 133.20 yen.
   The dollar started to fall in the afternoon session as investors
began to sell the currency after the Bank of Japan checked exchange
rates, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   ``After the dollar surpassed the 133-yen level, the majority of
participants withdrew to the sidelines, fearing possible
intervention by the Bank of Japan,'' an analyst with a commercial
bank said.
   In early April, Japan's central bank intervened by selling
dollars to support the yen when the U.S. currency reached the
133.50-yen level.
   Traders also said investors were reluctant to make major moves
ahead of Friday's release of U.S. trade and wholesale price figures
in Washington.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the Nikkei index fell as
investors took profits ahead of the release of the U.S. economic
figures.
   Institutional investors stayed on the sidelines due to lingering
political uncertainties and the dollar's current strength, said a
dealer with a major securities firm in Tokyo, speaking anonymously.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has revoked a
regulation that his predecessor issued as a parting shot to his
critics.
   The order by Thornburgh on Wednesday rescinds an order by
outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese III last summer that had
required the Justice Department to appoint independent counsels to
investigate members of Congress.
   Thornburgh's action returns to the Justice Department _ at least
while Congress studies the legislation _ its traditional role in
investigating allegations of criminal wrongdoing by members of
Congress.
   ``The Congress has been asked to review the role of the
independent counsel,'' Thornburgh, who had expressed doubts about
the Meese order, said in a statement.
   The order was issued hours after Bush proposed in his ethics
package to extend to members of Congress the law providing for
court appointment of independent counsels to investigate high

<NOTE>Analysts Foresee Brownouts In Northeast This Summer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Predicted temporary electricity shortages in
the New England states this summer could be a prelude to
``brownouts'' throughout the nation in the 1990s, energy analysts
say.
   ``What happens in the Northeast will be a harbinger for the rest
of the country,'' Leonard J. Kujawa, an Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.
analyst who helped direct a study on electric power trends in the
United States, said Wednesday.
   Although electricity supplies for the peak use periods of summer
are tightest in New England, the power outlook for the nation as a
whole is growing more uncertain, said Daniel Yergin, president of
Cambridge Energy Research Associates and a partner in the study.
   The central problem is that U.S. electricity demand has grown
more rapidly than expected since 1985, while utilities have chosen
not to add to their generating capacity, Kujawa and Yergin told a
news conference on the results of their study.

<HEAD>Physicists Celebrate As Stanford Collider Produces Its First Z Particle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicists popped champagne corks after a $125 million atom
smasher made its first Z particle, a milestone in the quest to
``understand what's in the mind of God'' by studying the birth of
the universe and the makeup of matter.
   ``I'm happy, with relief and joy,'' said Burton Richter, 1976
Nobel laureate in physics and director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, 30 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   Richter said scientists drank champagne Wednesday after
confirming one Z particle was produced Tuesday by the 3-mile-long
Stanford Linear Collider after an almost two-year delay.
   While Z particles are incredibly tiny, they are the heaviest
known fundamental particle of matter, weighing the same as 100
protons, the positively charged particles in the center of atoms.
They can be thought of as ``heavy light'' because they are a
heavier version of photons, particles that carry light.
   Discovered by European scientists in 1983, Z particles are so
heavy they could have existed naturally only for an instant after
the ``big bang'' _ the incomprehensible explosion scientists
believe formed the universe up to 20 billion years ago.
   Stanford's collider is designed to mass-produce Z particles by
smashing together electrons _ negatively charged particles that
make a television picture _ and their antimatter counterparts,
called positrons. Mass production of thousands of Z particles will
take months, Richter cautioned.
   The scientists at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics
(CERN) found the particle by using a collider in which protons are
smashed against the antimatter counterparts called antiprotons.
   Since 1983, hundreds of Z particles have been produced at
different kinds of particle smashers at CERN and at Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago. Those machines produced some Z
particles but mostly other products of atomic decay.
   The Stanford collider and one being built at CERN's lab in
Geneva are to produce mostly Z particles.
   Temperatures approach 1 million-billion degrees at the tiny
collision point inside Stanford's machine, coming close to
re-creating conditions that existed in the first one-tenth of
one-billionth of a second after the big bang, said California
Institute of Technology physicist Alan Weinstein.
   ``We're doing this to try and understand more about the physical
universe: the fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces
that hold those building blocks together,'' Richter said.
   The collider will let physicists ``peer deeper into matter and
look back at what the universe was like nearer and nearer to its
beginning,'' he added.
   The particle, Stanford physicist Michael Riordan said, is ``the
key to understanding the birth of the universe. It helps us
understand the forces that bind matter together and make it decay''
radioactively.
   Richter said last year that ``what we're really after is trying
to understand what's in the mind of God.''
   The collider's successful creation of its first Z particle is a
triumph for American physicists and for Richter. That's because the
machine cost one-eighth as much as the $1 billion Large
Electron-Positron collider, due to produce Z particles as soon as
July at CERN.
   There was no guarantee Z particles would be produced by the
untested technology of Stanford's collider, which is shaped like a
huge tennis racket instead of like CERN's conventional ring-shaped
collider.
   ``This is a milestone,'' said Jeff Sherwood, spokesman for the
U.S. Department of Energy, which paid for the collider. ``We're
delighted to hear the news.''
   Construction of Stanford's collider was completed in May 1987.
Richter had hoped it would produce Z particles that summer.
Scientists started it up a year ago, shut it down in September to
correct technical glitches, then restarted it in February.
   The modifications added $10 million to its original $115 million
cost, Riordan said.
   Weinstein said the collider should help physicists inch toward
their ultimate goal of developing a ``theory of everything'' _ a
simple theory that would explain all the particles and four
fundamental forces of nature. Many scientists believe the four
forces are simply different forms of a single force that existed at
the beginning of time.
   The four fundamental forces are gravity; electromagnetism, which
produces light, radio waves, X-rays and microwaves; the strong
force, which binds protons and neutrons together in the center of
atoms; and the weak force, which makes some atoms break down
radioactively.
   The discovery of Z and related W particles at another type of
atom smasher at CERN in 1983 yielded the 1984 Nobel Prize in
physics for Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer because it helped
verify ``the standard model.'' That theory says electromagnetism
and the weak force really are two forms of a single ``electroweak''
force.
   Stanford's immediate goal once it mass-produces Z particles is
to confirm the standard model by testing predictions about the mass
of the Z particle and existence of particles called Higgs bosons.
Some scientists also believe the machine may help them discover the
elusive ``top quark,'' one of six types of quarks in atoms.
   The collider is run by Stanford University for the Department of
Energy, with more than 100 scientists from many universities
involved.

<HEAD>Soviets To Make Ships For Pepsi, Pizza, Fried Chicken</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norwegian ship brokers have cooked up a deal
in which Soviet shipyards may build up to 85 new vessels worth
nearly $2.6 billion that will be partly paid for in Pepsi, pizza
and fried chicken.
   Ole-Jacob Libaek, who helped broker the deal, said Wednesday
that the U.S. soft drink giant Pepsi Cola Co. wants to replace
vodka as the medium of payment for millions of dollars in products
it exports annually to the Soviet Union.
   Libaek said ``Pepsi Cola is very big in the Soviet Union and the
Russians also want Pizza Huts and Kentucky Fried Chicken,'' both
owned by Pepsi.
   The Soviets ``prefer to trade goods for goods because of their
deficit of foreign currency,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Pepsi markets Soviet vodka but wants to replace the liquor in
the bartering arrangement because vodka sales plummeted following a
U.S. boycott over the 1979 Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   Sweden's Absolut vodka picked up much of the market, and Pepsi
``ended up being paid with a product it couldn't sell,'' Libaek
said.
   He said Pepsi will get 25 percent of the ships' sale price to
help cover Pepsi imports.
   The Norwegian business magazine Economic Report reported today
that Pepsi's business in the Soviet Union will reach $600 million
in 1990.
   The letter of intent to buy the ships was signed by Fram
Shipping, the Bermuda-based operation of Norwegian shipowner Per A.
Arneberg, a close friend of Pepsi head Don Kendall, the magazine
said.
   Fram, Pepsi, Libaek and the Soviet government also formed the
joint venture Nor-Sov Ship to supply Norwegian technology to the
five Soviet yards chosen to build the vessels, Libaek said.
   Under the barter arrangement, the Soviet shipyards will supply
vessels including tankers and freighters. Contracts have been
signed for two ships, nine more are pending and a letter of intent
covers the rest.
   ``You don't sign contracts for 85 ships in one day. It will take
time,'' Libaek said.

<TEXT>
   Pal Maleter, a 39-year-old Hungarian
general, told his wife that his countrymen desperately needed him
during their uprising against the Soviets in 1956, and off he went
_ on a course that led to his execution.
   ``My husband said, `In a situation like this, one cannot place
one's family over the needs of an entire nation,''' said his widow,
now Judith Gyenes.
   Maleter was executed in 1958 for his role in the failed revolt
against Soviet domination, along with the defiant Premier Imre Nagy
and others. The executions were carried out in secret and announced
later without elaboration; unofficial reports at the time said they
were hanged.
   Now after 30 years, in the course of renewed attempts at
wide-ranging political reforms, the leaders of the 1956 uprising,
held in disgrace by the Communists, are re-emerging in the official
consciousness as pioneers of reform.
   For three decades Ms. Gyenes and other relatives of the revolt's
leaders have fought for their official recognition as patriots
rather than counter-revolutionaries.
   The Communist Party leadership, at a meeting in February
partially reassessed its evaluation of the 1956 events as a
counter-revolution, acknowledging that it also bore elements of a
popular uprising.
   As the Communist Party's ideologist, Janos Berecz had said
recently that political rehabilitation of the 1956 leaders is under
way with publication of three books on Nagy and the revolt. On
Wednesday, Berecz was one of four conservatives removed from the
Politburo in a move that appears to strengthen party leaders who
favor introducing a multiparty system.
   The relatives also have been given official permission to rebury
their loved ones in marked graves.
   The bodies of Nagy, Maleter and three others have been exhumed
from unmarked graves in plot No. 301 of Budapest's sprawling
Rakoskeresztur cemetery. The funeral is set for June 16, the
anniversary of Nagy's execution.
   Nevertheless, Maleter's widow says, the government still has a
long way to go to face up to the tragedy of the 1956 revolt.
   ``I don't think the authorities have come to the stage where
they can confront the whole nature of this and see it for the
travesty of justice that it was,'' she said in an interview in
Budapest, where she is a librarian.
   According to Western estimates, as many as 30,000 people died in
the uprising, which began Oct. 23, 1956, and was brought to a
bloody end by Soviet troops and tanks Nov. 4.
   Ms. Gyenes, now 55 and remarried, remembers the last time she
saw her Maleter as a free man.
   It was Nov. 3, 1956, and he had just been named Nagy's defense
minister and was appointed to head the Hungarian delegation to
negotiate with Kremlin emissaries on the withdrawal of Soviet
troops.
   Nagy had declared Hungary a neutral country and withdrew it from
the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   ``My husband was optimistic,'' Ms. Gyenes said. But she added
that she was extremely upset that he was going to a Soviet military
base for the negotiations with the Kremlin officials.
   The next day, Maleter and his entire delegation were under
Soviet arrest.
   Two years later Nagy, Maleter and an estimated 2,000 others were
executed.
   Ms. Gyenes was allowed to see her imprisoned husband only twice
before his death and received just two letters from him. They had
no children.
   ``This whole episode was one of the most infamous occurrences in
Hungarian history,'' she said.
   When the revolt broke out Maleter commanded a column of
Hungarian tanks that rushed to Budapest's Kilian barracks to defend
it against rebels, but after speaking to some of them, he joined
the revolt and announced he was turning the barracks over to the
revolutionaries, a key factor in solidifying popular support for
the uprising.
   Ms. Gyenes said an enormous crowd gathered to hear Maleter speak
at the barracks.
   ``I was amazed that this unknown military man all of a sudden
was a popular hero,'' she said.
   A leading Communist reformer in today's Hungary, Imre Pozsgay,
has said the national consensus needed to overcome the country's
current problems can only be achieved by ``clearing up the past.''
   Maleter's widow agrees.
   ``It is my conviction that until ... justice is served, there is
no way we can speak of any kind of consensus or a new social
contract,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Mexico's reputed No. 1 drug dealer,
Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, hails from this narcotics trafficking
center that's been known as ``Little Chicago'' for its legacy of
gangland murder.
   Drug agents in this Sinaloa state capital have discovered fields
of marijuana outside town that were irrigated and nurtured like any
other crop. Five-thousand tons were burned in one raid in 1984.
   Culiacan also is home to a shrine to the ``narcosanton,'' or
``big narco-saint,'' Jesus Malverde, a common criminal who died in
1909 and is believed by some to provide protection and cure
illnesses.
   The shrine, condemned as pagan by the Roman Catholic Church, is
less than a block from the statehouse in Culiacan, a city of 1.3
million people about 850 miles northwest of Mexico City.
   In 1985 and 1986, Culiacan became known as ``Little Chicago''
because there were so many killings _ an average of five a day.
   According to the book ``Desperados'' by Elaine Shannon, people
were afraid to sit by their windows for fear of stray bullets. The
book quotes an unidentified army officer as saying more than 500
girls were kidnapped and raped during those years.
   Reports that Felix Gallardo was at one time hiding out in the
governor's house were taken seriously, although the governor denied
the allegation.
   When federal authorities decided to move against Felix Gallardo
and corrupt officials on Saturday, they trusted Culiacan's police
so little they took the entire force, all 600 of them, into custody.
   Army troops had been dispatched to arrest top local and state
police officials.
   But Culiacan was not Felix Gallardo's home at the time of his
arrest. He moved to Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city,
years ago and that's where he was caught.
   On Wednesday, federal prosecutors charged him with criminal
conspiracy and illegal possession of weapons. On Tuesday, he was
charged with multiple counts of possessing, transporting and
trading in illegal drugs.
   He has issued no plea.
   About 200 special agents on Wednesday checked records at banks
and land offices in five states, seeking millions of dollars in
hidden bank accounts and properties.
   After agent Enrique Camarena Salazar of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration was slain in March 1985 _ a killing
Felix Gallardo reported opposed _ the accused drug lord lived under
cover and moved frequently, U.S. officials say.
   He managed to escape the clutches of Mexican police for years
because corrupt officials allegedly protected him.
   Officials estimate Felix Gallardo's holdings are worth more than
$500 million, much of it invested in legitimate businesses in
Culiacan and Guadalajara. He had 50 cars, at least three airplanes
and raised thoroughbred horses, they say.
   On Wednesday, federal police and troops shuttered businesses of
suspected drug traffickers in Culiacan, and pickup trucks loaded
with soldiers occasionally cruised the streets.
   The Chamber of Commerce disputed claims that Felix Gallardo was
a major player in Culiacan's economy.
   ``I don't believe the economy here benefited significantly from
Felix Gallardo. From what I know, he invested his money in many
places,'' said Francisco Javier Partida Perez, the chamber director.
   People say Felix Gallardo rarely was seen in public in recent
years, and questions about him were met with suspicion.
   ``Why do you want to know? Who are you?'' asked a cashier in
response to a question about what she thought of his arrest.
   Most officials were unavailable for comment.
   The mayor was too busy to receive reporters. The governor was
meeting with the president in Mexico City. The acting police chief
referred all questions to the prosecutor's office, and the
prosecutor was in meetings.
   ``It's a hot potato. Nobody wants to touch it,'' said a police
officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The police, for their part, appeared to be more upset about
being held in custody for 24 hours than anything else.
   Local police officers were detained Saturday to avoid leaks or a
shootout while federal authorities arrested officials who allegedly
took bribe money from Felix Gallardo. Those seized included the
state's top drug-enforcement officer and the city police chief.
   One Culiacan officer worried about how the case would affect his
department's image.
   ``It hurts our reputation,'' he said. ``Now people will think
we're all crooked.''

   Israeli-allied militiamen in southern Lebanon
captured four Shiite Moslem guerrillas in Israel's self-proclaimed
security zone after wounding one guerrilla in a firefight, the army
said today.
   There were no casualties among the militiamen belonging to the
South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-trained 2,500-member militia, the
military command said.
   It said the guerrillas carried a cache of weapons but that their
affiliation could not immediately be determined.
   The clash occurred Wednesday night near Markaba, a village two
miles from the Israeli border, the army said.
   Israel's national Itim news agency said the guerrillas were
apparently on their way to plant a roadside bomb and mines in the
security zone.
   The zone is a six-to-10 mile buffer strip along the border that
Israel carved out in 1985 after withdrawing the bulk of its troops
from Lebanon. The zone is jointly patrolled by the South Lebanon
Army, a mostly Christian militia, and about 1,000 Israeli troops.

   Abbie Hoffman was ``an American legend' who stayed true to his
beliefs long after his contemporaries sold out to the establishment
he had rallied young people against during the 1960s, friends and
family said.
   ``It's the end of an era,'' said Hoffman's younger brother, Jack.
   Abbie Hoffman was found dead in his home in Bucks County, Pa.,
by a neighbor Wednesday night. The cause of death was not
immediately known.
   ``He was 52 years old and I think he gave up,'' said Jack
Hoffman in a telephone interview from his suburban Boston home.
``My brother packed in a lot of miles in his life. Maybe he was
tired. I know he was disappointed in the young people of today. He
didn't feel he was getting through to them.
   ``He was disenchanted.''
   Hoffman gained national attention as a member of the Chicago
Seven, a group of radicals who led hundreds of protesters at the
1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
   He remained steadfast to his leftist beliefs to the end.
   ``To me he was a genius who was able to organize large numbers
of people, motivate them and reach them in ways that nobody else
could do,'' said Hoffman's attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, of New York
City. ``His approach was always unique and amusing but also
convincing and who dedicated his life to the things that he
believed in changing.''
   Said John Oakes, Hoffman's publisher: ``He was somebody who
stayed true to what he believed in unlike so many of his
contemporaries who sold out and became just what they detested when
they were 20 years old.
   ``I find him inspiring and I hope a whole new generation will
find his example something to aspire to.'' said Oakes.
   Hoffman, however, criticized today's campuses as ``bastions of
rest,'' and last week said the interest young people have in the
'60s disturbed him.
   ``Nostalgia is a sign of middle-age,'' he said before an
appearance last week at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.
``We're reminiscing about our youth. When you see young people
nostalgic for a youth they didn't even experience, it's a little
sad. They're supposed to be out making one for themselves.''
   At Vanderbilt, Hoffman participated in a panel discussion with
other '60s activists, including psychedelic drug guru Dr. Timothy
Leary.
   ``Oh, God. I'm stunned. He was brilliant,'' remarked Leary when
reached at his Los Angeles home Wednesday night and told of
Hoffman's death.
   Later, after collecting his thoughts, Leary added:
   ``Abbie Hoffman was an American legend. He was up there in the
hall of fame with rebel Huck Finn, rowdy Babe Ruth, crazy Lenny
Bruce. He was the Pete Rose of the '60s counterculture, a hustler,
a base stealer, a wild free spirit and a gambler. He is a historic
figure and a great American and I loved the guy.''
   Lefcourt remembered Hoffman's sense of humor, which ``really
covered his outrage at a lot of injustice that he saw.'' Hoffman
made a few appearances as a stand-up comedian last year.
   ``He threw money on the (American) stock exchange floor in the
late '60s and was able to show in that satirical event _ when
hundreds of people on the stock exchange on Wall Street chased
flying money on the floor _ how silly it all was,'' said Lefcourt.
   Jack Hoffman said he hoped history would treat his brother more
kindly than did life.
   ``He was a great patriot,'' he said. ``He loved America and he
loved the system because it allowed him to do what he did:
protest.''
   Now, Hoffman said, a great American story has ended.
   ``I guess now they can make the movie,'' he said. ``We talked
about writing a script, but there were always problems with the
ending. I guess now we know how it goes.''

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index declined
today, while the dollar slipped slightly against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 132.80 yen, down 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
close of 132.85 yen. It opened at 133.03 yen, but traders said it
started to fall following hints of intervention by the Bank of
Japan. It ranged between 132.75 yen and 133.20 yen.
   Traders said the central bank had been calling to inquire about
rates, a tactic that implies intervention and often is used to
indirectly discourage dollar-buying.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, an 8.07-point gainer the
previous day, shed 192.51 points, or 0.58 percent, closing at
33,063.94.
   Dealers said investors held back, awaiting the announcement of
U.S. major economic indicators and watching whether the dollar
would remain stable.
   On Friday, Washington is to announce U.S. trade figures for
February and the wholesale price index for March.
   Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro Inouye said investors also
were discouraged by news reports that Saudi Arabia has decided to
cut crude oil shipments to Japan in May by 40 percent from normal
levels.
   A feeling of political instability still was bothering
investors, he added.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 850 million
shares, down from Wednesday's 1 billion.
   In currency dealings, the dollar moved little while the market
awaited Friday's announcement of the U.S. economic indicators,
traders said.
   After the Bank of Japan's rate checking, most participants
withdrew to the sidelines, fearing possible central bank
intervention if the dollar rose above 133 yen, said a dealer with
the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In early April, the central bank sold dollars to support the yen
when the U.S. currency reached the 133.50-yen level.

   Singer Anita Baker captured three awards for
her single and album ``Giving You the Best That I Got'' and Michael
Jackson was honored for his hit ``Man in the Mirror'' at the third
annual Soul Train Music Awards.
   Vocalist Al B. Sure! was named best new artist and New Edition's
``Heart Break'' won album of the year at the awards ceremony
Wednesday.
   Miss Baker won for best female urban contemporary rhythm and
blues single; song of the year for ``Giving You The Best That I've
Got''; and for the best female urban contemporary album of the year.
   She won two rhythm and blues Grammys in February for her smoky,
sentimental single, which she wrote with Skip Scarborough and Randy
Holland.
   ``We wrote that song with the thought of my husband, Walter, and
I am so glad that it was so well-received,'' she said.
   Singer Dionne Warwick and sports broadcaster Ahmad Rashad were
co-hosts of the two-hour syndicated broadcast, a spinoff of the
``Soul Train'' television dance show.
   Jackson's ``Man In The Mirror'' won in the rhythm and blues
category for best urban contemporary single by a male and best
music video.
   The pop idol also was given special awards for his lifetime
achievements and contributions and the first-annual trophy in
recognition of the year's top performing star, named in honor of
Sammy Davis Jr.
   ``First I'd like to thank God, who makes all this possible,''
Jackson told the audience. ``Then I'd like to thank my mother and
father, Joseph and Katherine Jackson.''
   ``Take Six,'' by the group of the same name, won best gospel
album and ``Da Butt'' by E.U. won best rhythm and blues urban
contemporary single from a group.
   The awards were created three years ago as a means of
recognizing soul music, said Soul Train's Don Cornelius.
   Al B. Sure!, who won an award as a new artist for his rhythm and
blues single ``Off On Your Own (Girl),'' said he was glad to be
part of the Soul Train awards.
   ``That's why it's special,'' he said. ``There are other music
awards, like the Grammys and the American Music Awards, but this is
something more _ from the heart.''

<HEAD>Engineers Flying From London To Fix Crippled Concorde</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British engineers headed for Australia
today to install a new rudder on a British Airways Concorde jet
that lost part of its tail while trying to set speed records on an
world-circling journey.
   The Concorde was flying at about 1,500 miles per hour from
Christchurch, New Zealand, to Sydney on Wednesday when a large
chunk of the tail fin disintegrated at about 40,000 feet over the
Tasman Sea, the airline said.
   Spokeswoman Katherine Wilson said specialists due in Sydney
today would ``work through the night'' to repair the damage so the
plane can leave on the next leg, Perth in Western Australia, on
Friday as scheduled.
   In London a company spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping
with British custom, said spare parts left London on Wednesday with
two engineers.
   The three-week journey started in London April 1 with 100
American passengers including commentator William F. Buckley who
each paid $39,000 to travel supersonic for 38,343 miles.
   The plane's pilot, Capt. David Leney, said he was climbing out
of Christchurch at Mach 1.8, nearly twice the speed of sound, when
there was a ``very slight bang.''
   ``There was no indication at all what it was,'' he told a news
conference. ``We decided to carry on. The airplane was carrying on
perfectly in every way.''
   Leney said he had no idea what was wrong until he was alerted by
the control tower at Sydney's Kingsford-Smith International Airport.
   ``I was very surprised to see just what was missing,'' he said.
``I felt slightly shaken. One doesn't like to see one's airplane
with a piece missing.''
   Passengers contacted by the AP said the plane ``shuddered''
about 25 minutes out of Christchurch.
   British Airways would not detail the extent of damage but
photographs of the plane showed a large chunk missing from the rear
section.
   News reports said the plane is about 10 years old and one of the
newest in the airline's fleet of seven Concordes, built by a joint
British-French consortium.

<HEAD>Man Charged In Fire Deaths Skipped Judge's March Jail Order</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A vagrant forced out of an apartment house
hours before it was set on fire has been charged with nine arson
deaths, and authorities say he should have been in jail for another
case but ignored a judge's order.
   Joe Pickens, 34, never reported to the Peoria County Jail on
March 31 to serve a 30-day sentence for a misdemeanor, court
records show.
   No arrest warrant was issued, and now Pickens faces more serious
crimes: nine counts of first-degree murder and two counts of
aggravated arson in the worst fire in the history of this central
Illinois city.
   ``I don't fault the sheriff or the jail,'' State's Attorney
Kevin Lyons said Wednesday.
   The missed jail date was included on the jail's list of
violations to be brought to Lyons' attention _ an action the jail
takes about every two weeks, the prosecutor said.
   Pickens, a native of York, Ala., was charged with the deaths
Wednesday, one day after a fire set in a vacant first-floor
apartment spread and killed seven children and two young mothers on
the second floor.
   Pickens confessed to setting the fire after saying it started
accidentally, according to Police Superintendent Allen Andrews.
   Pickens apparently stayed at the two-story house in the past and
``was put out of the house (Monday night), but he came back,'' said
Fire Chief G. John Parker.
   Parker said he did not know why Pickens had been forced to leave.
   Circuit Judge Robert A. Barnes set bond at $2 million, and
scheduled a hearing for May 5.
   Neighbors in the working-class area of town expressed shock.
   ``I'm angry and hurt and surprised he'd so something like that
to those folks,'' said Claudie Garner, who lives across the street
with her husband, Jim, and their nine children. ``They were nice
and never did anything to hurt anyone.''
   Pickens was supposed to surrender to serve the month for
resisting arrest, his 22nd misdemeanor conviction since 1983, court
records show.
   The records show his most frequent address was the Peoria Rescue
Mission, where superintendent Richard Brienen recalled an incident
in which Pickens threw bricks at the building after being ejected
for violating house rules.
   ``My nickname for him was `Trouble,''' Brienen said. ``The guys
used to call him `Trash Can Joe.' Sometimes when he'd get kicked
out of here he would just go crawl out in the trash cans to sleep.
Well, the next day he'd smell like it.''
   More than 200 people attended a memorial service Wednesday for
the victims.
   The Rev. John Gibson, pastor of Rising Sun Missionary Baptist
Church, said a funeral was scheduled for Friday for all nine
victims.
   ``Everybody is devastated by this situation,'' Gibson said.
``It's shocking.''
   The victims were Terry Davis, 27, and three of her children,
Arnisha, 7, Karlissa, 2, and Tanoa, 10; Mrs. Davis' sister, Wanda
Hobbs, 20, and her children, Felicia, 4, Ashley, 1, and Eugene
Roberts Jr., 2 months; and Jacolby Thomas, 2, the daughter of Joyce
Barnes, one of the survivors.
   All died of smoke inhalation.
   Ms. Barnes, 30, and Eric Davis, 14, son of Terry Davis, were in
fair condition at the burn unit at Franciscan Medical Center in
Rock Island.

<HEAD>Two More Bidders For Northwest Airlines Identified</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment company founded by former
U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon and three former Marriott
Corp. executives have been identified as suitors for Northwest
Airlines, according to reports published today.
   The two groups are contending with Los Angeles billionaire
Marvin Davis, who has submitted a $2.62 billion bid to take over
the nation's fourth largest airline.
   Amid speculation of bidders other than Davis, the stock of NWA
Inc., Northwest's parent, closed Wednesday up 1{ at 90{, surpassing
Davis' offer of $90 a share.
   One of the other bidders is Wesray Capital Corp., a New York
investment company founded by Simon, the St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch reported today.
   Bruce Retrum, a union leader for some of Northwest's 6,500
flight attendants, told the newspaper that Saunders Miller, a
Minneapolis financial consultant, contacted him to try to set up a
meeting with union leaders and a Wesray representative to discuss a
leveraged buyout.
   ``There were no specifics, but my assumption was that he wanted
to talk about an ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) or some
employee stock ownership,'' said Retrum, secretary-treasurer of
Teamsters Local 2747.
   The meeting was scheduled for today but then postponed by
Miller, Retrum said. Miller declined to comment.
   Last week, a spokesman for Simon said he wasn't interested in
buying Northwest.
   Meanwhile, the Star Tribune in Minneapolis reported today that
the third suitor includes Gary L. Wilson, a Walt Disney executive
who left Northwest's board in November, Al Checchi, a Los Angeles
businessman, and Frederick Malek, a former member of the Nixon
White House and campaign adviser to President Bush.
   All three are former executives of Marriott, a travel
conglomerate that provides Northwest and other airlines in-flight
meal service.
   William Genoese, airline director for the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, said Checchi and Wilson have informed him
that their group owns 4.9 percent of Northwest's stock and wants to
buy the company, the Star Tribune reported.
   Checchi, through an assistant in his Los Angeles office,
declined to comment. Wilson was traveling in Europe and was
unavailable for comment.
   But a spokesman for Malek confirmed the existence of Checchi's
group. The spokesman said Malek is a ``passive investor in a
partnership headed by Mr. Checchi.''
   On March 28, Northwest disclosed the Checchi group's existence,
but not its identity. Northwest said the group suggested a friendly
leveraged buyout. The company's board rejected that overture and
also announced the adoption of a corporate ``poison pill'' to
discourage a hostile takeover.
   The disclosure sent the carrier's stock price soaring and
spurred Davis, who holds a 3 percent stake in Northwest, to make
his $90 per share bid. The board rejected Davis' bid last week.
   Davis, an oil mogul with interests in real estate and
entertainment, has said he plans a shareholder proxy fight to win
control of the airline's board at NWA's May 15 shareholders meeting.
   Northwest has asked a federal judge to prevent Davis from
meddling with its unions, while Davis has filed a separate lawsuit
seeking to invalidate Northwest's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
plan.

<HEAD>Juror Misconduct Ruling Could Earn New Trial for Convicted `Trailside
Killer'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The forewoman of a jury that convicted a man of
five northern California trailside murders improperly knew about
his criminal past, a judge has ruled.
   Although Wednesday's finding could lead to a new trial for David
Joseph Carpenter, Superior Court Judge Herbert B. Hoffman did not
overturn Carpenter's conviction or vacate the death sentence
imposed for the 1980 Marin County parkland slayings.
   ``I'm absolutely convinced that the evidence in this case is
overwhelming beyond a shadow of a doubt as it applies to
(Carpenter's) guilt and sentencing,'' Hoffman said. ``That's one of
the reasons I find this decision distasteful to make.''
   Prosecutors were given until May 1 to file briefs stating their
reasons why Carpenter, 58, of San Francisco should not be retried
on grounds that jury forewoman Barbara Durham's misconduct tainted
the jury's findings.
   Defense attorneys will have three weeks to file their reply
before both sides return to court June 1.
   ``Whether this juror misconduct is something that will overturn
this conviction is something we'll have to decide,'' Hoffman said.
   The ruling culminated a three-month hearing involving
allegations that Durham found out during Carpenter's six-month
trial that he already was on death row for two similar 1981
killings in Santa Cruz County.
   ``I'm confident my decision regarding Mrs. Durham's jury
misconduct is correct, but it does not please me,'' said Hoffman,
who expressed sorrow for the victims' families.
   ``This has to be something that is going to be devastating to
them,'' Hoffman said about the possible retrial.
   Two acquaintances of Mrs. Durham testified during the hearing
that she indicated in a March 26, 1988, dinner conversation that
she knew about Carpenter's involvement in the Santa Cruz killings.
   Defense attorneys who filed the retrial motion contend such
knowledge was prejudicial enough to Carpenter's defense to warrant
a new trial.
   Hoffman had issued a pretrial ruling that barred jurors from
knowing about Carpenter's previous conviction and death sentence.
   Michael Lustig, a San Diego businessman, and his former
girlfriend, Barbara Duran, both quoted Mrs. Durham as saying, ``I'm
not supposed to know this, but the defendant has been convicted of
doing the same thing in another county and has been sentenced to
death.''
   Mrs. Durham denied she made such a statement.
   But Hoffman said Mrs. Durham appeared extremely nervous when she
took the stand to respond to the allegations and the judge added he
felt her ``memory was selective.''
   The judge said he would leave it up to the San Diego County
district attorney's office to decide whether Mrs. Durham should be
prosecuted for discussing the case before the end of the trial.
   Carpenter, who has spent most of his adult life behind bars, was
convicted last May of the nine-week murder spree at Point Reyes
National Seashore and Mount Tamalpais State Park.
   The death penalty automatically will be appealed to the state
Supreme Court, where Carpenter's appeal of the Santa Cruz
conviction is pending.

<HEAD>Shamir Says PLO Talk May Be Sweet, But Still Unrealistic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said talk
of peace is seductive, but negotiations with the Palestine
Liberation Organization would only lead to war.
   ``I would sit with anyone if I thought for one minute that it
would bring a just and lasting peace to our country and to our
region,'' Shamir told the Foreign Policy Association on Wednesday.
   ``But I know, and everyone who is familiar with our region
should know, that negotiations with the PLO will not bring peace.
They are a sure prescription for war. And while I shall do anything
I can for peace, I shall not lend myself to moves which will make
another war inevitable.''
   Shamir's speech before the Foreign Policy Association, a
non-profit organization whose goal is to promote public
understanding of international issues, concluded a 10-day U.S.
visit in which he met with President Bush in Washington. Shamir was
to leave for home today.
   The Israeli government is under pressure from the United States
to open talks with the PLO now that its leader, Yasser Arafat,
publicly recognized Israel's right to exist and renounced terrorism.
   During his Washington visit, Shamir proposed allowing
Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to elect
representatives to negotiate a form of self-rule. The proposal
received support from U.S. officials.
   The PLO said Monday that any elections in the territories should
be held after an Israeli withdrawal and under international
supervision, according to the PLO news agency, Wafa.

   Intelligence agents arrested a
dissident leader aboard a plane today as he returned from
reunification talks in communist North Korea and police rounded up
about 800 radicals who protested the arrest.
   About 20 officials of the Agency for National Security Planning,
South Korea's main intelligence agency, boarded a Northwest Orient
flight from Tokyo and arrested Rev. Moon Ik-hwan on charges of
violating national security laws. Moon's companion, Yoo Won-ho, was
also arrested.
   Moon was led down a stairway on to the tarmac after agents
pounded on one of the plane's door, demanding it be opened. The
71-year-old dissident was quickly driven away in a black car as
intelligence agents ringed the area.
   About 4,000 riot policemen ringed Kimpo airport to prevent
radicals from greeting Moon and arrested about 60 dissidents and
students who yelled slogans and unfurled banners after sneaking
into the terminal.
   Moon created a major political controversy in the south by
making a secret visit to North Korea last month to meet with
communist leader Kim Il Sung to discuss ways to reunite the divided
Korean peninsula.
   The government ordered a major crackdown on dissidents and the
visit threatened to stall peace talks between the two Koreas.
   South Koreans cannot visit the north without government
permission.
   Thousands of radical students staged violent protests in at
least five cities in support of Moon, clashing with riot police
when they were blocked from marching off campuses. Police said they
had no figures on how many students took part, but Korean press
reports said about 10,000 students protested at 23 colleges
nationwide.
   Police detained about 700 radicals who tried to get to Yonsei
University in Seoul for a rally to welcome Moon, police said.
Another 50 students were arrested when about 1,000 protesters
marched out of the campus peacefully and police armored vans fired
tear gas.
   Students at four other colleges in Seoul hurled firebombs and
rocks at police who fired tear gas and hurled rocks back in clashes
around the campuses. About 3,000 students clashed with police in
the southern port of Pusan, some 2,000 students fought police in
Kwangju in the south and violent clashes were also reported in
Taegu and Chunchon.
   ``Murderer (President) Roh Tae-woo cannot arrest Moon Ik-hwan!''
students yelled.
   South Korean officials said North Korea's dealings with Moon
were an attempt to undermine the Seoul government's authority. They
say Moon and other dissidents are aiding North Korean attempts to
gain control of the peninsula.
   Prosecutors said Moon would be charged with visiting North Korea
to receive instructions from a hostile government and for
``praising anti-state elements.'' If convicted, Moon could face
anywhere from five years in prison to the death sentence, although
there is little chance he would be executed.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the Korean
peninsula was divided after World War II ended in 1945. North Korea
invaded the south in 1950 at the start of the bloody three-year
Korean War.
   Many South Koreans were outraged when state television showed
pictures of Moon embracing Kim Il Sung and complimenting the
communist strongman for his leadership. Kim is feared and hated in
the south for having ordered the 1950 invasion and many South
Koreans fear the totalitarian north still wants to conquer the
south.
   Moon's visit to North Korea appears to have damaged South
Korea's dissident movement by linking it to the north. North.
Dissident leaders publicly have defended Moon's trip but privately
concede it has damaged their credibility.
   The dissidents and radical students have been waging a violent
campaign to try and oust the Roh government. They have little
public support, but their frequent demonstrations have caused
widespread concern about South Korea's political stability.
   Dissidents deny they are pro-North Korea, but many insist the
two Koreas must be reunited immediately and differences in the two
nation's political systems be resolved later.
   The government used Moon's visit to order a series of crackdowns
on the dissidents. Five senior dissident leaders have been arrested
as part of the crackdown and police have taken tougher measures
against violent protests.

   The stench of death lingers at the
ranch where police dug up the bodies of 12 men who cult members say
were used in ritual sacrifices or klled for drug-related revenge.
   Inside a small hut with tar paper siding and a corrugated metal
roof, the odor of decomposing tissue was overwhelming Wednesday
afternoon.
   Police say suspects told them the building was used for carrying
out the killings.
   Scattered on the stained, fetid floor of the approximately
15-by-30-foot shack were bullet casings, cigars, chili peppers,
broken glass and empty liquor bottles.
   Outside the door, a cast-iron caldron held brains and other
organs, a turtle shell, a horseshoe and other objects in a thick,
dark liquid. Smaller bowls nearby held a dead rooster, charred goat
heads and other objects that had been cooked.
   A windowsill held what looked like a bird's nest made of tissue
paper and human hair.
   What appeared to be skin from a human hand was floating in a
yellowish liquid inside a piece of tractor tire about 20 yards
away, near the grave of Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old University of
Texas student who disappeared March 14 while on spring break in
Matamoros.
   The victims were exhumed Tuesday from nine shallow graves in or
near a corral on the 20-acre ranch area that borders on farm fields.
   Cult members said they were involved in the killings for about
nine months, according to investigators. Kilroy and some other
victims were hacked to death with a machete, authorities said.
   ``It's beyond belief of anybody that lives in a civilized
nation,'' said Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, who visited the
site.
   He said Kilroy was found with a wire inserted in his spine and
the cult had planned to use it later to extract the vertebrae for
use in necklaces.
   Mexican Federal Judicial Police have arrested five men, and were
searching for several other people, including the cult's
``godfather'' who told members the ritual killings would bring them
demonic protection from enemies.
   ``We killed them for protection,'' one of the suspects, Elio
Hernandez Rivera, 22, of Matamoros, told reporters at a news
conference.
   Cult members were importing about 1,000 pounds of marijuana a
month into the United States, Mattox said.
   ``Very clearly they believed the human sacrifices and the animal
sacrifices put a magical shield around them that protected them
from evil or harm, even up to bullets,'' Mattox said.

<HEAD>Soviets To Mothball Space Station For 3 Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will leave the orbiting space
station Mir unmanned for three months because of delays in
preparing equipment that cosmonauts need to perform experiments
aboard the spacecraft, Tass says.
   The news agency said Wednesday that cosmonauts Alexander Volkov,
Sergei Krikalev and Valery Polyakov will return to Earth April 27,
leaving the Mir station mothballed for only the second time since
it was launched in 1986.
   ``When three Soviet cosmonauts return back to Earth from their
orbiting station Mir in about a fortnight, the facility will be
left unmanned for several months due to delays with the preparation
of two research modules,'' Deputy Flight Director Viktor Blagov
told Tass.
   ``This is because without the two modules, which will make it
possible to conduct wide-ranging research, including studies in the
interest of the Soviet economy, there is little sense in keeping
cosmonauts on the space station any further,'' Blagov told the news
agency.
   Tass first announced Tuesday that the cosmonauts would return
and leave the station without a crew, but the report Wednesday
contained the first explanation of why the project was being
suspended.
   Some speculated the suspension was for economic reasons. The
move was announced after critics called for deep cuts in spending
on the space program. The announcement also came shortly after the
Soviets lost two probes to Mars at a cost of nearly $480 million.
   The mothballing of Mir makes economic sense, Blagov said. He
said that expensive new equipment, both on the ground and on the
space station, was needed, as well as training of future cosmonauts.
   ``It is fairly difficult to do this in the course of a manned
flight, so the adjournment will simplify many things,'' he said.
   The move, also announced on the evening television news program
Vremya, effectively cancels the launch of cosmonauts Alexander
Balandin and Alexander Viktorenko scheduled for April 19.
   The announcement coincided with Cosmonauts Day, the anniversary
of Yuri Gagarin's first manned space flight 28 years ago, which was
marked Wednesday night with a seven-minute fireworks display that
lit up the sky over Moscow.
   Blagov defended the cost of the space program.
   ``We plan to promote space commercial services and have already
begun to do this. Of the 19 agreements signed by the Soviet space
agency Glavkosmos with other countries and foreign firms, 10 have
been carried out,'' he said.
   Blagov admitted that the Soviet Union was not capitalizing on
space exploration. ``Soviet space technology is up to the highest
world standards, but industrial spin-offs are pitifully scanty as
very few of the space industry's achievements are turned over for

   Mir, which the Soviets have said is the first building block of
a permanently manned space station, has been mothballed only once
before, a seven-month period following the return to Earth of its
first inhabitants, Vladimir Solovev and Leonid Kizim, June 25,
1986, after three months in space.
   Since the arrival of cosmonauts Yuri Romanenko and Alexander
Laveikin in February 1987, the spacecraft has been manned.
   On Dec. 20, cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov set a
world's record for space endurance, living aboard the Mir orbiter
for 365 days and 22 hours.
   They were joined in the final months of their record-setting
space voyage by Polyakov, a physician who traveled to the Mir
station on Aug. 28 to monitor the effects of living in a
gravity-free environment for extended periods.
   Titov and Manarov were replaced by Krikalev and Volkov. Polyakov
stayed aboard the orbiter to continue experiments in space health
techniques.

<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS name of ailment to Graves' sted Graves disease throughout.
No pickup.</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Barbara Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush's most recognizable feature, her
silvery hair, may also be a sign of her most recent medical
problem, an overactive thyroid gland, doctors say.
   Although no one knows exactly why, prematurely gray hair and an
illness called Graves' disease sometimes go together.
   Graves' disease occurs when the thyroid glands in the neck churn
out too much hormone, causing a variety of seemingly unrelated
symptoms. The ailment is fairly rare but easily treatable with
radioactive iodine, a therapy that Mrs. Bush received Wednesday.
   ``Many of us worried about her thyroid long ago when we heard
about the premature graying of her hair,'' said Dr. Gilbert H.
Daniels of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
   Mrs. Bush's hair turned white three decades ago, when she was in
her early 30s. Untimely gray hair certainly isn't harmful, but
people who get it are also at higher than usual risk of Graves'
disease as well as several other conditions, including diabetes,
pernicious anemia and white skin patches called vitiligo.
   Graves' disease, which afflicts four in every 1,000 people, is
an inherited disorder caused by a mixup in the body's
disease-fighting immune system. The body produces antibodies that
mistakenly attack the thyroid gland as an enemy. Instead of harming
the gland, they stimulate it to grow and work non-stop, producing
too much thyroid hormone. Though the tendency is passed from parent
to child, no one knows precisely what triggers the antibody attack
to occur.
   The overabundance of this hormone, called thyroxine, speeds up
the body's chemical reactions. Like Mrs. Bush, victims may lose
weight and have irritated eyes. Frequently they complain of gritty
feeling eyes or blurred vision.
   Symptoms vary from person to person but can also include:
   _anxiety and fidgetiness. People may have trouble sleeping and
their hands may tremble.
   _insensitivity to cold. Victims may feel comfortable in summer
clothes on cold days and complain that rooms are too warm.
   _rapid heartbeat. The heart works harder than necessary, and
this may be dangerous in people with underlying heart disease.
   _enlarged thyroid gland, a condition known as goiter.
   _protruding eyes that make people seem to be staring.
   ``In the untreated state, it can certainly be life-threatening,
but these days we recognize and treat it very readily,'' said Dr.
David Madoff of Johns Hopkins University.
   The most common treatment is radioactive iodine, which when
introduced 50 years ago was one of the first medical uses of
radioactive material.
   The thyroid gland needs iodine to make hormone and absorbs it
readily. However, the gland cannot distinguish radioactive iodine
from the normal variety.
   With this treatment, patients take a pill or drink radioactive
iodine. The material is taken up by the thyroid gland, and over a
period of months largely destroys it, leaving the gland shrunken
and unable to make enough hormone. As a result, patients usually
must take thyroid pills for the rest of their lives.
   ``It is simple, safe and effective,'' said Daniels, and does not
cause cancer or other health problems.
   For a few days after treatment, however, people may give off
slightly elevated amounts of radiation.
   ``You have to avoid close contact with people for the next week
and flush the toilet bowl twice for the next three days,'' said
Madoff, ``because iodine not absorbed by the thyroid is excreted in
the urine.''
   Medicine and surgery are also used to treat the disease. While
anti-thyroid drugs can make people feel better, the disease usually
returns when people stop taking them. Surgery accomplishes the same
result as radioactive iodine but requires anesthesia and can
occasionally result in damage to the nearby parathyroid glands.
   Graves' disease (named for Irish physician Robert James Graves,
who described it in 1835) is about eight times more common in women
than in men.

   A 12-year-old boy, accompanied by a
15-year-old, led police on a chase at speeds up to 95 mph before
crashing a stolen car into a freeway guardail, officers said.
   The youngsters were treated for minor injuries and arrested
Wednesday night.
   Police officer Zane Smith said he was in his patrol car, taking
information about a missing car, when the incident began.
   ``I was sitting there with the owner taking the report, when the
car came flying by us and he yelled, `That's my car!''' Smith said.
``I then got him out of the car and started the pursuit.''
   The chase circled an area several blocks wide and involved
several other police cars before the 12-year-old drove onto
Interstate 15, Smith said.
   ``I swear that they must have been going at least 90 to 95 miles
per hour on the freeway,'' Smith said.
   The stolen car crashed while zigzagging on an I-15 off-ramp,
police said. The car was on the interstate for about 1{ miles.
   ``It's a wonder the car didn't just go flying right off the
edge,'' said Police Sgt. Terry Orton.``It was totally destroyed.''

<HEAD>Sugar To Be Rationed In Moscow, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities will begin rationing sugar in
Moscow next month, a newspaper said, in a move that is likely to
increase discontent with the effects of the nation's economic
reforms.
   Sugar has been rationed in many areas of the Soviet Union for
months, but some Muscovites said the limits on sugar purchases
announced in the Moskovskaya Pravda newspaper are the first decreed
in the capital since World War II.
   Demand for sugar skyrocketed in the Soviet Union after Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev launched his anti-alcohol campaign in
April 1985, which included sharp cuts in the production of vodka
and other alcoholic beverages.
   Gorbachev and other Soviet officials have blamed the increase in
sugar consumption since then on Soviets who buy the substance to
brew ``samogon,'' or moonshine, at home.
   Limits on sugar sales, without precedent in the lifetime of many
Muscovites, seemed certain to increase anger over the effects of
Gorbachev's reforms. Many Soviets say ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring, has not improved their traditionally dreary diet or
put better quality goods in the stores.
   Moskovskaya Pravda, in its Tuesday editions, quoted Valery A.
Zharov, chief of the consumer trading department of the Moscow city
government, as saying the ``sugar boom'' in Moscow began in April
1988 and that the product disappeared then from city stores.
   The city's government requested an extra 50,000 tons of sugar to
meet increased demand, but consumption again shot up in February,
Zharov said.
   He blamed the latest jump in demand on the imposition of sugar
rationing in most areas of the Russian federation and in the other
republics of the Soviet Union, meaning outsiders were stocking up
on sugar while in Moscow.
   The capital was again given an additional 40,000 tons of sugar,
Zharov said, but the additional supply did not satisfy demand.
   ``For example, in March, we sold 2,000 tons daily,'' said
Zharov. ``But 600-800 tons is considered the norm for the city.''
   ``No matter how sad it is, we are forced to introduce coupons
for the right to buy sugar,'' he said. ``In May, to every
Muscovite, including children and temporary residents, we will
guarantee two kilogarams (4.4 pounds) of sugar.''
   That quantity will be increased to 6.6 pounds per Muscovite in
June and July, the season when many people traditionally make fruit
preserves, he said.
   Asked how long Moscow residents will need ration cards to buy
sugar, Zharov said the system should remain in place until the end
of the year.
   He said the Moscow City Council would meet Saturday to discuss
when and how to implement the rationing-card system.
   Other food products have been rationed since World War II in
Moscow, including flour in the 1960s.
   In many other regions of the Soviet Union, people have needed
``talons,'' or ration cards, to buy meat, sausage and other
foodstuffs for years.

<HEAD>Drug-Cult Leader Raised In Santeria Family</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leader of a drug trafficking gang accused of
ritually killing 12 people near Matamoros, Mexico, grew up in a
Cuban-American family that practiced Santeria animal sacrifices,
authorities believe.
   Residents of the middle-class neighborhood in west Dade County
where Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, lived until 1984 said they
found headless chickens, geese and goats on their doorsteps and in
the streets near his home, The Miami Herald reported today.
   Such animals are ritually sacrificed by followers of Santeria, a
religion that mixes elements of Christianity with African animism.
   ``The mother was in Santeria,'' said Norma Brito, who bought the
Constanzos' house after their bank foreclosed in 1984. Ms. Brito
said she found the remains of an altar with candles, wax and fruit
when she moved in.
   ``They had sheep and chicken in the back yard,'' said Carmen
Reigada, another neighbor. ``They were troublemakers.''
   Mrs. Reigada said she discovered a headless chicken on her
doorstep after her son quarreled with Constanzo's mother, Aurora
del Valle de Posada, the Herald reported. Constanzo was the oldest
of four children.
   Both Mexican and U.S. police said the suspects in the killings
described the rituals as Cuban Santeria sacrifices taught to them
by Constanzo.
   There is no evidence, however, that Santeria has ever sanctioned
human sacrifices, said Mercedes Sandoval, an anthropology professor
at Miami-Dade Community College who has studied the religion for
three decades.
   ``These may have been a group of deranged people who may have
started with Santeria and ended with these barbarities,'' she said,
``but what they did is not Santeria.''
   Santeria was introduced to Cuba by African slaves, who blended
their polytheistic beliefs with Roman Catholic dogma, identified
African gods by the names of Catholic saints, and carried out
animal sacrifices to summon those gods, Sandoval said.
   Metro-Dade police said they couldn't confirm whether Constanzo,
whom they arrested twice for shoplifting in 1981, was the same man
being sought as the ``godfather'' of the drug-smuggling ring.
   Officer George Gabito of the Cameron County Sheriff's Department
in Brownsville, Texas, said authorities suspect Constanzo is the
gang's leader. U.S and Mexican authorities were searching for him
today, and said they believe Constanzo is in the United States.
   After one of his 1981 shoplifting arrests, Constanzo told police
he was born in Miami Beach and was a student at Miami-Dade
Community College. The registrar at the college said Constanzo took
classes there about 1980-81 but did not graduate.
   Neighbors said Constanzo traveled back and forth to Mexico
shortly thereafter, the Herald reported.

   Fires that scorched 32,000 acres of dried-out
sawgrass and threw a haze over South Florida dwindled after
thunderstorms, and only a few scattered hot spots remained today.
   A cold front moving down the Florida peninsula shifted the wind
and blew away the dense smoke cover, which had forced the temporary
evacuation of nearly 750 would-be immigrants from a detention
facility at the edge of the Everglades.
   The state Division of Forestry announced late Wednesday that
large brushfires in western Dade county and smaller blazes in Palm
Beach county had been contained, with ``just a few pockets''
burning.
   Larry Lahiff of the National Weather Service said forecasters
expected continued showers tonight. He said a strong shift in wind
direction dispersed the smoke, but sent some of it over Key West
and the Fort Myers region.
   ``There's still some haze, but in the lower levels of the
atmosphere it's been keeping fairly clear,'' Lahiff said.

   Actor Reginald Vel Johnson, who played the
police sergeant who talked Bruce Willis through the movie ``Die
Hard,'' spent a night in jail after he was arrested for
investigation of cocaine possession, authorities said.
   Johnson, 36, was arrested Tuesday night, while county sheriff's
narcotics investigators were watching an alleged drug dealer's
home, Sgt. Terry Judge said Wednesday.
   ``During the surveillance, the deputies would observe customers
drive up to the location, conduct a transaction and drive away,''
Judge said.
   He said deputies followed the buyers until they were out of
sight, then stopped them and searched them for illegal drugs.
   Johnson was stopped at 7:20 p.m. in the city's Hancock Park
district, about six miles west of downtown. He was arrested for
investigation of possession of cocaine and held in jail overnight
in lieu of $2,500 bail, sheriff's officials said.
   Investigators later arrested Derrell Robert Powers, 30, at his
home for investigation of possessing a controlled substance for
sale, Judge said. Powers was being held in lieu of $20,000 bail.
   In the 1988 hit ``Die Hard,'' Johnson played an officer who
communicates with Willis by radio while Willis, who also plays a
policeman, is trapped in an office building that has been taken
over by terrorists.

   Israeli police and soldiers
shot and killed five Palestinians and wounded at least 15 today in
two clashes in occupied West Bank, hospital officials said.
   Most of the casualties occurred in the village of Nahalin, where
Israeli border police killed four Palestinians and wounded at least
15 while trying to make arrests before dawn, the hospital officials
said.
   Israeli troops opened fire on rioters in nearby Bethlehem and
killed at least one Palestinian, hospital officials said. Another
resident reportedly died of wounds from an earlier clash.
   Israeli military officials confirmed just one Palestinian died
and four were wounded in the raid on Nahalin. Other Arab reports
said as many as six Palestinians were killed today, and Israel
radio reported dozens were wounded.
   An ambulance driver interviewed on Israel radio said he took
four bodies from Nahalin to the hospital. Villagers said at least
one other Palestinian was buried without going to a hospital, but
that could not be confirmed.
   An army announcement said the shootings in Nahalin, which is six
miles south of Jerusalem, occurred during a pre-dawn arrest raid.
   An army spokeswoman told reporters that a senior army commander
entered Nahalin to investigate the shooting.
   ``We are trying to check with the hospitals now. Initial reports
indicate the border police went into the village, saw activity and
were attacked,'' she said on condition of anonymity.
   Villagers from Nahalin, interviewed in hospitals, said about 300
Israeli border police and army soldiers in 35 jeeps staged the raid.
   ``It was a massacre,'' Mohammed Mustafa, 59, a farmer from
Nahalin told a reporter at Mukassed hospital in Jerusalem. ``The
army came to kill. They fired indiscriminately.''
   However, another Arab villager, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said troops opened fire after being attacked with stones
by a dozen Palestinians. He said about 70 soldiers were in Nahalin.
   The army clamped a curfew on Nahalin, barring journalists and
forcing the 2,000 Palestinian residents to stay indoors.
   Nahali teacher Mohammed Ali told reporters at Beit Jalla
hospital near Bethlehem that youths blocked roads and stoned border
police and soldiers who entered Nahali. But the troops circumvented
barricades and entered on foot.
   ``Border police got on the roof and fired down on the people,''
Ali said.
   Some villagers suggested Jewish settlers were involved in the
shooting, but Ali said he saw no civilians. The rumors added to
tensions in nearby Bethlehem.
   In Jerusalem, officials at Mukassed Hospital said they treated
16-year-old Fuad Yussef Najajra of Nahalin, who died of a gunshot
wound to the head.
   In the Beit Jalla hospital near Bethlehem, officials said they
had two bodies. They said Subhi Mahmoud Shakarna, 21, died of a
gunshot in the chest while Riyad Ali Shakarna, 22, a relative, was
killed by a shot in the head. Both were shot on the rooftop of
Nahalin mosque, villagers said. There were no details of the fourth
fatality reported by hospital officials.
   Residents in Bethlehem rioted after Mukassed hospital doctors
reported 17-year-old Daoud Khaled Nasser died of wounds suffered in
an April 6 clash with troops. Reporters had watched Nasser killed
by a soldier who opened fire without warning, in apparent violation
of army regulations.
   Roads leading to Bethlehem's Manger Square, where Nasser was
shot, were blocked with rocks, burning tires and overturned dump
trucks. At least 300 Palestinians, including women and children,
stoned military jeeps and waved Palestinian flags, chanting
slogans. They fled into side streets when troops fired tear gas,
rubber bullets and live ammunition.
   A Palestinian, his head wrapped in a mask made from an outlawed
Palestinian flag, said the demonstration was to protest the death
of Nasser, whom he charged was shot intentionally. The army later
forced reporters out of the city, saying it was a closed military
area.
   Mukassed doctors said family members later contacted the
hospital to say a youth was killed in the demonstration.
   At least 430 Palestinians have been killed in the 16-month
uprising in the occupied territories. Eighteen Israelis also have
died.

   Four conservatives have been removed
from the ruling Politburo and replaced by two reformers in a move
that appears to strengthen Communist Party leaders who favor
introducing a multiparty system.
   The changes in the party's senior guard Wednesday follow its
endorsement in February of ending the Communists' political
monopoly in this country, where a 1956 anti-Soviet uprising was
brutally crushed by Soviet tanks.
   Last month, the party leadership further committed itself to at
least partially free parliamentary elections next year.
   Among those removed Wednesday was the chief party ideologist,
Janos Berecz, who was voted into the Politburo in 1987 and until
last year was considered a prime candidate to replace long-time
party leader Janos Kadar.
   New party leader Karoly Grosz and the party's two leading
reformers, Imre Pozsgay and Rezso Nyers, received important votes
of confidence at Wednesday's closed-door session of the
policy-setting Central Committee. State media also reported Premier
Miklos Nemeth was also re-elected to his top party post.
   Grosz and his entire team had offered to resign on Tuesday
during a meeting of the 108-member Central Committee, party
spokesman Laszlo Major told state television.
   Grosz gained the top party post at a national party conference
last May.
   Major said the four members who left the Politburo either were
not nominated to the new Politburo or asked not to be nominated. He
did not elaborate.
   The other three ousted conservatives are Judit Csehak, minister
of social affairs and one of two women on the ruling body, party
bureaucrat Janos Lukacs, and Istvan Szabo, who was in charge of
agriculture, an area targeted for broad reform under the new
economic policies.
   Elected new members to Politburo was the secretary of the
influential Budapest Communist Party, Mihaly Jasso, and Pal
Vastagh, who heads the reform-oriented Csongrad county party
committee in southern Hungary.
   According to a brief statement carried by the state news agency
MTI, the Central Committee said the party was ``struggling with
political, ideological and organizational structural problems.''
   Major told state television that there have been increasing
complaints from the party's membership about too many
``contradictory statements'' by the ruling body's leaders.
   He indicated the changes were intended to increase unity among
party leaders, saying claims of a split in the party were now
``groundless'' in view of the new Politburo.
   Major quoted Grosz as telling the closed-door meeting it was
time to activate the membership of the party ``for the coming
struggles ahead.''
   He said former party chief Kadar attended the second half of
Wednesday's meeting. Kadar has been absent from several Central
Committee meetings, reportedly for health reasons.

   Investigators have identified and are
searching for the person they believe planted the bomb that blew up
Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland on Dec. 21, according to a network
television report.
   CBS-TV news reported Wednesday night the suspect is a member of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
and is a relative of Hafez Dalkamoni, who is said to have set up
the network which carried out the attack.
   CBS said sources refused to reveal the suspect's name or
whereabouts.
   The London Daily Telegraph reported today investigators believe
an American passenger was duped into carrying the bomb onto the
flight.
   The newspaper said investigators have narrowed the number of
people suspected of carrying the bomb aboard to between three and
five American passport holders who probably joined the flight in
Frankfurt.
   It said Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are searching
European cities to find the terrorist who gave the passenger the
radio-cassette player in which investigators have confirmed the
bomb was placed.
   The Pan Am jumbo jet crashed in southern Scotland, killing all
259 people aboard and 11 other people on the ground.
   Dalkamoni was in prison at the time of the bombing, picked up
last October following a raid on one of his safe houses. Along with
weapons, German police found three Toshiba radio cassette players
similar to the one used to blow up Pan Am 103, CBS said.
   The television network said that, with Dalkamoni in prison,
investigators are searching for his relative, who they suspect gave
a suitcase containing the booby-trapped cassette player to one of
the passengers aboard the plane.
   Investigators believe the passenger who unwittingly carried the
bomb was Khalid Jaafar, a young Lebanese-American college student
who lived in Michigan and who was returning home from Frankfurt for
the Christmas holidays, CBS said.
   FBI agents have questioned Jaafar's parents at the family-run
gas station in Detroit but the parents insist he was not involved.
   The network said many of the leads in the case are coming from a
member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine who is
cooperating with investigators.
   It said the Popular Front has its headquarters in Syria but the
investigation has uncovered evidence linking the Pan Am bombing to
Iran.

   A car bomb exploded outside a hotel in
the northeastern city of Trincomalee today, killing at least 38
people and injuring 57 in an attack military officials blamed on
Tamil rebels.
   Shortly after the blast, a group of angry Sinhalese attacked
Tamil residents in the city with knives, killing one and injuring
seven, military officials in Colombo said on condition of
anonymity. Officials denied earlier reports from witnesses that
eight Tamils were killed in the stabbing.
   The explosion in the port city, 145 miles northeast of Colombo,
occurred as more than 100 Sinhalese in a marketplace adjacent to
the hotel hunted for gifts and sweets to celebrate the Sinhalese
and Tamil New Year holidays.
   An Indian diplomat in Colombo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the explosives were rigged in a black Morris Minor
car.
   The midmorning blast flattened four neighboring shops, the
military officials said. Sketchy reports reaching Colombo did not
say whether the hotel was still standing or how large it was.
   At least 24 of those killed in the blast were Sinhalese, the
military officials said. The others were Tamils and Moslems.
   Rescue workers dug through the brick and mortar rubble rubble
looking for more victims of the blast and officials said the death
toll could rise.
   Military officials blamed Tamil separatists for the attack. But
the largest Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, denied responsibility for the blast, a spokesman for the
group said in Colombo.
   Normal communications between Trincomalee and most other parts
of the island have been severed in the 6-year-old Tamil
separatists' war against the Sinhalese majority.
   The Indian diplomat said the casualty reports were from Indian
peacekeeping troops, who have been deployed in northern and eastern
Sri Lanka since 1987 in an effort to disarm Tamil guerrillas and
enforce a peace accord.
   Indian peacekeeping forces patrolling the area imposed an
indefinite curfew on the city shortly after the blast.
   Officials in Colombo said hundreds of Sinhalese living on the
outskirts of Trincomalee were moved to a naval dockyard. They did
not give any details.
   Indian troops patrolling the region were rushed to the area to
prevent further ethnic violence and imposed a curfew, officials
said.
   The blast occurred a day after the beginning of a cease-fire
that the government called for the New Year holiday.
   According to government spokesmen, 26 militants of the Marxist
Sinhalese People's Liberation Front surrendered their arms on
Wednesday, giving themselves up at temples and government offices
converted into reception centers for rebels who give up violence.
   The government has set up 228 such centers across the country.
   Tamil rebels on Wednesday ambushed an Indian army patrol in
northern Sri Lanka and killed at least seven soldiers shortly after
the government's cease-fire took effect, officials said today.
   Tamil rebels have rejected the cease-fire and an amnesty offered
by the government until Indian troops are withdrawn from the island
nation, spokesmen for the rebels said.
   The government has suspended military operations against
anti-government Tamil and Sinhalese militants for a week and
offerred a general amnesty to those willing to surrender arms.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa, seeking to end six years of
ethnic violence that has claimed 12,500 lives, announced the
amnesty and cease-fire on April 2 as part of a plan that includes
seats in Parliament and jobs for the militants.
   India sent more than 50,000 troops in 1987 to disarm Tamil
rebels and patrol the north and eastern provinces after signing an
accord with the Sri Lankan government aimed at ending the Tamil
insurgency.

   Jurors in the Pentagon procurement
bribery and conspiracy trial began a fourth day of deliberations
today.
   When they left Wednesday without a verdict, the four women and
eight men had spent more than 27 hours considering the case against
Dale Schnittjer, Eugene Sullivan and George Kaub, former executive
vice presidents at Teledyne Electronics in Newbury Park, Calif.
   The defendants are charged with bribery, conspiracy and wire
fraud in a scheme the government said involved hiring a private
consultant to pay bribes to a Navy official for inside information
about a $24-million contract that Teledyne ultimately won in July,
1987.
   The three men are the first to be brought to trial in the
defense contracting scandal.
   Private consultants William Parkin, Fred Lackner and Stuart
Berlin, the Navy official, all pleaded guilty in the case before
the federal trial began last week. They cooperated with the
government, as did Teledyne Industries, the parent of Teledyne
Electronics. That firm also entered a guilty plea in advance of the
trial.
   The defendants' attorneys said their clients were duped by
Parkin and his associates, whom the Teledyne executives believed
were running a legitimate business gathering information about the
contract for hand-held radar equipment. The businessmen never knew
that Parkin and his associates devised a plan to use Teledyne's
money to pay bribes to Berlin, the defense attorney said.

   Syrian and Christian gunners battled
across the capital's dividing Green Line today, blasting harbors
and residential districts as French envoys tried to arrange
evacuation of the wounded to a hospital ship.
   The shelling complicated the task of an Arab League mediation
panel seeking to enforce a cease-fire and open the way for
constitutional reforms that could end the sectarian conflict.
   The civil war, which entered its 15th year today, has claimed
more than 150,000 lives.
   Police said at least four people were killed and 10 wounded in a
fierce bombardment of residential districts this morning.
   In addition, four soldiers were killed during the night by
shells that hit the presidential palace in suburban Baabda and the
Defense Ministry in neighboring Yarze. Police said the palace and
defense ministry came under attack again today.
   The casualties brought the overall toll to 200 killed and 687
wounded since the latest fighting broke out March 8 between the
mainly Christian units of army commander Gen. Michel Aoun and an
alliance of Syrian soldiers and Druse militamen.
   Rockets fired from multibarreled launchers stationed around
Moslem west Beirut rained on and around Christian emplacements in
Beirut and Jounieh at midmorning, said a police spokesman who
cannot be named under standing rules.
   Christian gunners retaliated with 155mm barrages aimed at west
Beirut's Ein Mreisseh seaside residential district and Syrian
batteries stationed near the airport on the city's southern edge,
the spokesman said.
   Aoun, 53, who also heads a Christian military Cabinet in
Lebanon's dual government, renewed his demand or a Syrian
withdrawal from Lebanon. He accused Syria of moving gunboats into
northern Lebanon territorial waters.
   The Syrian military headquarters in Lebanon denied the charge.
   Bernard Kouchner, France's minister for humanitarian assistance,
said French helicopters would soon begin evacuating wounded
Lebanese to the hospital vessel La Rance.
   Kouchner, who arrived Tuesday, said Moslems were to be flown to
the ship from west Beirut's Bain Militair beach and Christians from
the port of Jounieh, 12{ miles north of Beirut.
   He did not say where the La Rance, equipped with 90 beds and an
operating theater, planned to drop anchor. But the leftist Beirut
newspaper As-Safir said it was to remain eight miles off Beirut.
   A spokesman for Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the
Moslem Cabinet, said ``the operation will go into full swing on
Friday.''
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said another French navy
auxiliary vessel, the tanker Penhors, planned to sail into Lebanese
waters Friday to unload six tons of fuel oil at the Moslem terminal
of Zahrani south of Beirut and the Christian Zouk harbor north of
the capital.
   As-Safir said that under a compromise worked out by Kouchner and
Hoss the tanker was to unload two tons in Zahrani and four in Zouk,
site of Beirut's main power plant.
   The plant has produced electricity for just one hour a day for
the past three weeks because the conflict has created a fuel
shortage.
   Hoss withdrew his objections to accepting French aid Wednesday
night after President Francois Mitterrand of France asserted that
his country was not choosing sides in Lebanon.
   France, which has traditional ties with the Christian community,
ruled Lebanon from the end of World War until its independence in
1943.
   The rival governments emerged in September after outgoing
President Amin Gemayel named Aoun, a Maronite Catholic like
himself, to head an interim Cabinet until a new head of state was
elected.
   Leftists and Moslems rejected the appointment on the ground it
violated an unwritten national covenant making the premier a Sunni
Moslem, the president a Maronite and the Parliament speaker a
Shiite Moslem.
   The current fighting erupted after Aoun imposed a naval blockade
on illegal militia ports that were siphoning off an estimated $100
million yearly in unpaid customs fees.
   Syrian forces joined in artillery barrages by Druse militiamen
and backed their siege of the 310-square mile Christian enclave
east and north of the divided city.

   Chinese Premier Li Peng met Japan's emperor and
empress today and invited them to visit China, government officials
said.
   Li made the invitation during a 20-minute meeting with the newly
enthroned monarch at the Tokyo Imperial Palace, a senior Imperial
Household Agency official said.
   If the invitation is accepted, Emperor Akihito would be the
first Japanese monarch to visit China.
   But the palace spokesman said several problems exist and the
visit would have to await the end of a year of court mourning for
Akihito's father, Emperor Hirohito, who died on Jan. 7 at age 87.
   ``Premier Li said that he hoped the royal couple would visit
when the time was right for them. In reply, the emperor thanked him
but said the decision must be made by the government,'' said the
agency official.
   The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,
said the two also discussed ``their nations' 2,000-year history,
including World War II.''
   Bitter memories of Japan's actions during World War II often
have clouded Japan-China relations. After sharp criticism by China
and other nations, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in February
retrated a statement that future historians must decide whether
Japan was an aggressor.
   More than 10 million Chinese died during Japan's 1937-45
invasion of the Chinese mainland. Beijing reacts strongly to any
Japanese attempt to deny responsibility.
   Japanese news reports have speculated that Akihito would express
regret over Japan's militarist past during today's meeting, but
government officials refused to confirm or deny this.
   ``The emperor expressed his views on the nations' pasts, and Li
welcomed those views,'' said the official.
   Earlier today, Japan announced it would lend China up to $734
million in the current fiscal year. The loan is to help fund 11
projects for modernization in China, including an expansion of
ports in Lianyungang and Qingdao and construction of a subway in
Beijing.
   Li is on a five-day official visit to Japan accompanied by
senior officials, including Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who met
today with his Japanese counterpart, Sousuke Uno.
   The last Chinese premier to visit Japan was Zhao Ziyang, now
head of China's Communist Party, in May 1982.

   Two armed inmates seized eight hostages at a
high-security prison and were allowed to leave the facility, but
police killed one and wounded the other when the men threatened to
kill a captive, Tass said today.
   The official news agency said all the hostages were freed
unharmed.
   Armed with ``self-made firearms and knives,'' the two men
sneaked into the administrative building at the high-security
prison colony in the Voroshilovgrad region of the Ukraine at 10:30
a.m. Wednesday. They took eight female employees hostage, the
official news agency said.
   Tass said the inmates barricaded themselves in the building and
demanded a bus and guarantees they would be allowed to leave the
colony, 500 miles south of Moscow.
   During negotiations with regional police and KGB chiefs, the
inmates were persuaded to release two captives, ``but the criminals
wouldn't set the others free unless authorities agreed to their
demands,'' Tass said.
   It identified the inmates as V. Maximov serving a 15-year term
for murder and theft, and O. Korzh sentenced to eight years in
prison for robbery and malicious hooliganism. It said both were
repeat offenders.
   After authorities decided to meet the criminals' demands, a bus
took them and their remaining hostages out of the penal colony.
Negotiators tried again to negotiate with the men before the bus
reached the highway, Tass said.
   The criminals demanded the release of another inmate and
threatened to kill one of the hostages immediately if that wasn't
done. After negotiations failed, authorities decided to attack,
Tass said.
   ``A carefully planned operation sprang into life,'' it said.
``Korzh was killed on the spot and Maximov wounded.''
   Tass said the situation had returned to normal at the prison.

outside a workshop for the mentally handicapped in northern England.
   A spokesman for Northumbria police said the man suddenly jumped
over railings near where Diana was standing.
   Television pictures showed the princess was startled by the
movement and stepped back as her bodyguard, Inspector Allan Peters,
grappled with the man.
   A police officer moved her away from the fracas, and she
continued meeting well-wishers and accepting floral bouquets.
   Gordon McMurchie, Northumbria assistant chief constable, said
the man ``managed to lay a hand on her arm before being

   The Supreme Court today ordered the
government to pay relief money to victims of the Bhopal gas
disaster until a $470 million settlement with Union Carbide can be
distributed, news reports said
   ``We are interested in providing relief to those who were
seriously injured,'' a three-judge panel ruled, Press Trust of
India reported.
   The court told the government to submit proposals for a relief
plan by Friday. It said victims should be paid from the state
treasury.
   Survivors of the Dec. 2, 1984 disaster requested immediate
relief after disbursal of compensation money was held up by legal
considerations.
   More than 3,400 died and 20,000 were injured when methyl
isocynate leaked from the indian subsidiary of Union Carbide Corp
in Bhopal. At least 500,000 people said they were affected by the
poison gas leak.
   The government sued the Danbury, Conn.-based firm for $3 billion
but reached a $470 million settlement with the company on Feb. 14.
   Many government critics have said the settlement is inadequate.
   A petition filed with the Supreme Court has challenged a law
empowering the government to act as sole representative of the
claimants, while another questions the way the settlement was
reached.
   A separate five-judge court panel is hearing the petitions.

<TEXT>
   An 18-year-old injured in a motorcycle accident
says words of encouragement recorded by Miami Dolphins quarterback
Dan Marino helped pull him out of his three-month coma.
   ``I think Dan Marino is just the greatest football player there
is, and the tape I got from him was really good encouragement,''
said Brent Doyle, who is preparing to leave the Mediplex Rehab
Hospital in Thornton, a Denver suburb, on Friday, a day before his
19th birthday.
   ``He just said, `You can snap out of it. Just keep up the hard
work. Me and all the Dolphins are cheering for you 100 percent. If
you get better soon you can watch the Dolphins, and you can watch
me perform,''' Brent said Wednesday.
   Don Doyle, Brent's father, said he played Marino's recorded
message for his son daily, often two or three times, during Brent's
coma.
   ``The first prognosis was really dim. They didn't give him much
hope at all,'' the father said. ``It's a miracle in my opinion.''
   Brent sustained serious head injuries last October when he lost
control of his motorcycle while riding through the Rocky Mountains
foothills west of Boulder.
   ``Maybe a day or two after the accident, a boy and a girl from
work came up and I was thinking Brent was such a Dolphins fan, it
sure would be nice to get something from Dan (Marino) to give him
when he gets out of the hospital,'' the older Doyle said. ``They
heard me say this and pursued it.''
   Marino's tape arrived in November.
   Then in mid-February, a little more than two months after
receiving Marino's taped message, Brent emerged from the coma.
   Dr. Joshua Yurfest, a physician at Mediplex, said the ``talk
therapy'' Doyle received is controversial among doctors, who refer
to it as ``coma stim,'' short for coma stimulation.
   ``We believe it makes a difference, but we don't know,'' he said.
   Brent began walking again in time for his best friend's wedding
in March and can now prepare his own meals. ``He's 97 percent
recovered,'' his father said.
   Brent says he plans to go ahead with his plans to study acting
once he completes his rehabilitation.
   ``The greatest thing now _ other than getting through this and
still being alive, and for the Dolphins _ it's really nice just to
go home,'' Brent said.

<TEXT>
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
will be attended by private nurses, as well as hospital staff, now
that he has been moved out of a hospital's intensive care unit,
says his wife, Imelda.
   The transfer to St. Francis Medical Center's telemetry unit,
reserved for monitoring heart patients, also will reduce the chance
of infection because it is not as large as intensive care, Mrs.
Marcos said Wednesday.
   Another reason for Wednesday's move is that the telemetry unit
is less expensive that intensive care, Mrs. Marcos said.
   The ousted leader has more than $250,000 in unpaid bills at the
hospital. Mrs. Marcos claims the U.S. government should pay the
bills and that she is financially unable to do so.
   Marcos, 71, remained in guarded condition. He has been
hospitalized since Jan. 15 for treatment of heart and respiratory
ailments.
   ``His condition hasn't really changed, but we're trying to free
up a room in ICU for a patient who may need it more,'' hospital
spokeswoman Norma Kop said. ``He'll still be getting very close
care, but in a different unit.''
   Asked if she believed her husband would ever be well enough to
be released from the hospital, Mrs. Marcos said: ``I am always
hopeful. I always believe in miracles.''
   The Marcoses are under U.S. indictment on criminal racketeering
charges accusing them of stealing more than $100 million from their
homeland and stashing it in the United States.
   Prosecutors have concluded Marcos is too ill to stand trial and
have temporarily severed him from the case, but are proceeding with
the case against Mrs. Marcos.
   The Marcoses fled here in February 1986 after an election and
popular revolt catapulted Corazon Aquino to power, ending Marcos'
20-year rule.

   Communist guerrillas released three
tourists and their Filipino interpreter unharmed today, a week
after they seized the mountain climbers and accused them of spying.
   A local physician pronounced the cheerful mountaineers in good
health as they were turned over to church and government officials
at the foot of Mount Apo in Astorga, 615 miles southeast of Manila.
   ``It's great to be back,'' said Gerald Leo Christopher Kennedy,
22, a chemistry graduate student from Ireland. ``They treated us
very well.''
   Telephone engineer Trevor Anderson, 35, from Tauranga, New
Zealand, said they felt safe with the New People's Army guerrillas
until Wednesday, when the captives heard shelling near the rebel
camp.
   ``Everytime we heard a bang, we dived into the foxhole, maybe
seven times,'' he said. ``It wasn't good fun yesterday.''
   James Andrew Smart, a 40-year-old cave explorer from Bristol,
England, said he was not happy to hear they had been suspected of
spying.
   The three were unshaven and looked haggard as they shook hands
with guerrilla leader Benzar Sarabia and an escort of 25 armed
guerrillas.
   ``Investigations have shown that these three climbers are
innocent, thus we are releasing them,'' a rebel statement said
before the captives were freed.
   The foreigners were among more than 300 climbers trekking to the
9,690-foot Mount Apo, the country's highest peak, as part of the
annual convention of the National Mountaineering Federation of the
Philippines.

<TEXT>
   Officials are investigating charges of brutality
in Soviet Georgia and specifically whether soldiers were armed with
shovels in a clash that killed 19 protesters, the Foreign Ministry
said today.
   ``The troops were not supposed to have those spades,'' ministry
spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said. If the investigation finds they
beat the protesters with metal shovels, ``there is a question of
whether these people should be punished or not.''
   The chief of the republic's Communist Party, Djhumber
Patiashvili, offered to resign after accepting responsibility for
Sunday's clash in the central square of Tbilisi, the capital of
Georgia.
   Patiashvili said he did not expect fatalities when troops were
ordered to break up the pro-independence demonstration. He said
troops were armed only with nightsticks and shields.
   Gerasimov justified the decision to clear the square, saying,
``We should take into account the situation which evolved, since
endless meetings lasted for five days and they all but paralyzed
the work of enterprises, and people also attempted to penetrate the
territory of government institutions.''
   On the streets of Tbilisi, a city of 1.2 million 900 miles south
of Moscow, groups of activists were passing out leaflets and
spreading rumors, the Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star said
today.
   Some leaflets claim that more than 19 people died Sunday, said
an editor at Akhalgadra Kommunisti, the Georgian Communist youth
newspaper.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda said picketers were calling on
workers in Tbilisi to strike. But Zirab Zomidze, an editor at the
Gruzinform news agency, said all enterprises were working today and
that only the university and some schools were disrupted.
   Foreign reporters have been barred from traveling to Georgia.
   A curfew remained in effect in the city and alcohol sales were
restricted, Gerasimov said.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who is a Georgian and
served as the Georgian party chief from 1972 to 1985, attended a
meeting of Georgian party leaders today. No details of the meeting
were released.
   Shevardnadze met with 200 Georgian nationalists, human rights
activists and strike organizers for almost three hours on Wednesday
in a debate Gerasimov described as ``rather sharp.'' Nationalists
demanded resignation of the government and a special session of the
Georgian Parliament to consider secession from the Soviet Union,
according to official and unofficial sources.
   The meeting ended when a number of nationalists walked out in
frustration, said Moscow activist Alexander Podrabinek.
``Shevardnadze only repeated commonplaces about perestroika,''
Podrabinek said.
   Other activists said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's appeal for
calm, published Wednesday in Tbilisi, would do little good to
appease the city.
   Gorbachev rejected the demands of nationalists who seek
secession from the Soviet Union and said they were igniting lethal
strife that damaged his drive for reform.
   The summary of Gorbachev's remarks, carried on the official news
agency Tass, blamed ``actions by irresponsible persons'' for the
loss of life, apparently exonerating soldiers and police from any
official blame.
   Zurab Zhankarashvili, a Tbilisi resident and member of the
Georgian human rights watchdog organization Helsinki Watch, called
Gorbachev's appeal ``very dry,'' and expressed doubts it would be
enough to ease tensions.
   Gorbachev also made a personal appeal for calm in February 1988
after ethnic strife occurred in Armenia and Azerbaijan. His call
only momentarily stemmed bloodshed in those southern republics,
where more than 90 people were killed last year.
   Demonstrations in Georgia began April 4 when protesters
criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian
minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by
Georgians.
   Other protesters demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet Union
because of alleged interference from the central government.

<HEAD>Cheney Hints That High-Tech Projects May Get Budget Ax</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, struggling to
cut more than $6 billion from the fiscal 1990 budget, has dropped a
strong hint that the B-2 stealth bomber and other high-tech weapons
that haven't yet gone into production may be prime targets.
   Defense sources said Cheney also is considering a slowdown in
the production of Trident missile submarines _ building one every
two years instead of one a year _ and might also order some cuts in
troop strength.
   In an interview Wednesday with a small group of newspaper
reporters, Cheney said he intended to meet an April 25 deadline for
presenting the administration's military budget proposal to
Congress and that all programs were still on the table _ even
personnel levels.
   The new defense chief agreed he had made some tentative
decisions but declined to discuss details.
   Cheney was then asked, however, for his views on ``stretchouts''
_ slowing the production line for a weapon to reduce the number
purchased during the year. Stretchouts frequently end up costing
the Pentagon more over the long run because of less efficiency on
the production line.
   In phrasing the question, the reporter cited the B-2 bomber and
the C-17 cargo plane _ two new aircraft programs that are nearing
the production phase.
   ``It seems to me that if you are talking about relatively
complex new weapons systems, or you are dealing with new technology
or we don't have a lot of experience, then lots of times delay or
deferral may make sense because you will learn more in the interim
process, get some of the bugs worked out and maybe find ways to
reduce cost,'' Cheney replied.
   ``If, on the other hand, you are talking about systems where you
already have a good deal of knowledge, experience ..., then when
you do a stretchout what you do is raise the cost of each item. So
I am in the process of resisting efforts to stretch out where it
adds significantly to the unit cost.
   ``When you are talking about new technology, then I'm more
sympathetic to the notion or argument that we ought to defer or
delay or stretch out the procurement.''
   A transcript of Cheney's interview was released this morning.
Spokesmen for the secretary declined to elaborate on his remarks.
   Other defense officials, however, who insisted on anonymity,
said Cheney was, in fact, urging a delay in production of B-2
stealth bombers but hadn't decided how long it should be.
   The plane, described by the Air Force as a revolutionary advance
in aviation, is designed to be invisible to enemy radar. The first
of the planes was unveiled publicly last November, but has yet to
fly.
   Cheney, who became defense secretary last month after the Senate
rejected President Bush's first choice, former Sen. John Tower, is
trying to cut roughly $6.4 billion from the fiscal 1990 budget
proposed by former President Reagan.
   Bush already has promised Congress he will make those cuts to
the Reagan plan, which totaled $315.2 in budget authority for
military and nuclear programs.

<HEAD>McMartin Trial Judge In `Death Struggle' To Send Case To Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the McMartin Preschool child
molestation trial says he is considering having the court pay one
juror's full salary to make sure he can keep a 12-member jury and
avoid a mistrial in the nearly 2-year-old trial.
   ``I can't think of anything worse than not getting a decision
from this jury. That's my nightmare,'' Superior Court Judge William
Pounders told reporters in an unusual interview in his chambers
Wednesday. ``If it isn't forthcoming, it's a major disaster.''
   He said he took the rare step of talking to reporters while the
trial was in progress to pressure attorneys to speed their
presentations.
   As the trial's second anniversary approaches next week, Pounders
said the proceeding is costing taxpayers $100,000 a month, with the
total cost of the case since its inception in 1984 reaching $15
million.
   McMartin Preschool director Peggy Buckey, 62, and her son,
Raymond, 30, are charged with 65 counts of child molestation and
conspiracy.
   The trial was originally being heard by 12 jurors and six
alternates. However, two of the six have been dismissed for medical
reasons, two for hardships related to their jobs and one for being
inattentive during the proceedings.
   Pounders expressed concern that if he now lets one juror leave
the trial because of financial hardship he will risk a mistrial
because there will be no alternates left if another juror becomes
ill.
   Jurors still must hear another several months of defense
testimony, prosecution rebuttal and final arguments.
   The judge said juror Mark Bassett told him the company he works
for in financial trouble and he fears he may be laid off or that
the company may go out of business. He said he might have to leave
jury duty _ for which he's paid $10 a day _ to seek other
employment.
   ``It may be obvious to the county of Los Angeles that it would
cost less to pay him than to mistry this case,'' Pounders said. The
judge called such action highly unusual but not unprecedented.
   Pounders said Tuesday he will begin cutting all but the most
critical witnesses to speed the trial, rejecting eight defense
witnesses.
   Pounders also said he was not speaking figuratively when he told
defense attorney Danny Davis that the case would go to the jury
over Davis' dead body.
   ``It is a death struggle for me as far as I'm concerned,'' the
judge said. ``If I put the stress on him and he has a heart attack
or if he puts the stress on me and I have a heart attack, that is
the way it will be.''

   Syrian helicopters fired rockets at two Soviet
naval vessels in the Mediterranean, and Syria apologized for the
raid that injured at least seven sailors, the Foreign Ministry said
today.
   The attack occurred Tuesday morning near the Syrian port of
Tartus, spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said at a news briefing.
   ``Two helicopters with Syrian markings attacked two Soviet
auxiliary vessels with rockets, namely a sea tugboat and a divers'
boat in the Mediterranean Sea,'' Gerasimov said.
   According to an initial probe, the attack was a result of
``erroneous actions of one of the Syrian helicopters,'' Gerasimov
said.
   He did not say what type of helicopters were involved or further
describe the Soviet vessels.
   The Soviets provide Syria with much of its military equipment.
   Gerasimov said seven Soviet crew members were injured, one
critically. The military newspaper Red Star identifed the
critically injured man as E. Shkitchenko and said, ``there is
little hope to save him.''
   ``The Syrian side expressed regret at the accident and offered
its official apology,'' the spokesman said.
   The Soviet media played down the incident with Syria, its
staunchest ally in the Middle East.
   The attack was first reported in a three-paragraph story in Red
Star.
   The official Tass news agency carried a two-paragraph dispatch
on Gerasimov's remarks. The evening newspaper Izvestia did not
mention the incident.
   Following the attack, the submarine-tracking ship Kraszny Kavkaz
and the cruiser Leningrad, on a routine patrol in the eastern
Mediterranean, hurried to the aid of the attacked vessels.
   The Soviets have maintained military facilities at Tartus since
1969.
   Gerasimov said a joint investigation commission has been set up
to determine why the helicopters attacked the Soviet vessels.

<HEAD>Four Family Members, Including Mom Eight Months Pregnant, Killed
In Rampage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man police say confessed to the bloody
killings of four members of a family, including an eight-months
pregnant mother, made a brief appearance before a judge today but
said nothing.
   Newton Carlton Slawson, described by police as a ``walking time
bomb,'' is charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one
of manslaughter in the deaths of Gerald Wood, his expectant wife,
Peggy, their two toddlers and the male fetus. Wood was a onetime
co-worker of Slawson's.
   The 34-year-old defendant, with a smooth-shaven head and droopy
mustache, was taken into a tiny jailhouse courtroom for an advisory
appearance before Hillsborough County Judge Vincent Giglio.
   ``You remain silent. Don't say a thing,'' public defender Ronnie
Gabriel told Slawson.
   No arraignment date was set. Slawson is being held without bail.
   Slawson, a former soldier and sailor from Concord, N.C., told
police he flew into a rage that he couldn't control in the Woods'
apartment.
   ``We just don't know why,'' said Deputy Police Chief Tom
DePolis. ``I guess the guy was a walking time bomb.''
   DePolis said Slawson was charged with manslaughter in the
killing of the fetus because he told police he cut a foot-long gash
in Mrs. Wood's belly in order to save it.
   The family was attacked Tuesday evening. Mrs. Wood, 21, died
Wednesday after surgery at Tampa General Hospital.
   ``She was shot several times, then cut in the stomach which
caused the loss of the infant,'' said police Sgt. Wiley Howell.
``The infant, a boy, was actually cut and died at the scene.''
   She managed to crawl downstairs from their apartment and next
door to her parents' house, and told her mother Slawson attacked
the family, police said.
   Police said they picked Slawson up about 10 blocks away and
recovered a .357-caliber Magnum pistol and a six-inch folding knife
from his car.
   ``During questioning, the suspect admitted to detectives that he
killed the family members,'' police spokesman Steve Cole said. ``No
clear-cut motive has been established.''
   Slawson told detectives he went beserk after Wood tried to force
crack cocaine down his throat, but ``we believe this is an excuse
he's using,'' Cole said today. There's no evidence of drugs, he
said.
   Slawson apparently met Wood when they both worked at a manure
plant, one of a series of jobs Slawson took since coming to the
Tampa area from North Carolina late last year.
   ``It surprises me that they knew each other. It surprises me
more than that Newton could do something like that,'' said Michael
Lange, manager of the Black Gold Compost Co.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Says Reagan Administration Undermined War on Drugs</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 4-6, Kerry told, from news conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration undermined its own
war on drugs, as it ``delayed, halted or interfered'' with
operations that jeopardized support for its policy in Central
America, a Senate panel reported today.
   The government looked the other way, according to the report,
when law enforcement agencies learned that drug traffickers were
protected and aided by some U.S.-supported Nicaraguan Contras,
members of the Honduran military, Panamanian strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega and Bahamian officials.
   The 437-page report was prepared by the Senate Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international operations,
whose chairman, John F. Kerry, D-Mass., held a series of public
hearings last year on international drug trafficking.
   Kerry told a news conference that anti-drug enforcement took
second place to foreign policy mainly ``for fear of jeopardizing
the war in Nicaragua.'' But he said that same war provided an
``opportunity for drug traffickers to link up with the Contras _
and they did.''
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, said in a written statement that while he agreed with
``substantial portions'' of the report, there were ``inaccuracies
in the representations of fact'' on the Contra-Drug issue.
   He said many of the allegations were ``old news'' that was
considered by the Iran-Contra congressional committee, reviewed by
grand juries or presented in State Department reports to Congress
in 1985-86.
   In the most glaring examples of what the committee found to be a
two-faced policy during the Reagan years, the report said:
   _While reports of Noriega's drug activities were mounting, the
U.S. government ignored the evidence as the Panamanian strongman
promised to help train Contra rebels and offered use of Panamanian
units to strike targets inside Nicaragua.
   The late CIA Director William Casey justified his failure to
raise the narcotics issue in a 1985 meeting with Noriega, the
report said, on grounds ``that Noriega was providing valuable
support for our policies in Central America, especially Nicaragua.''
   _The Drug Enforcement Administration apparently ignored
trafficking allegations against Noriega because the now-indicted
strongman also cooperated in DEA operations. But the DEA was
fooled, the report said, when Noriega used his close relationship
with the agency ``to share DEA information with traffickers.''
   _``When a former Honduran military officer who has assisted the
United States in the Contra war ... became involved in a
`narco-terrorist' plot to kill the elected president of Honduras,
high officials of the U.S. government interceded in an effort to
get his sentenced reduced.''
   The Honduran military, which the report said ``consistently
supported U.S. policies in Central America,'' included elements
that ``protected the cocaine trade,'' the report said.
   _The Drug Enforcement Administration opened its first Honduran
office in 1981 and closed it two years later for ``budgetary
reasons,'' even though the resident agent there found Honduran
waters were used for drug shipments. After the agent was
transferred to Guatemala, he continued to spend 70 percent of his
time dealing with the Honduran drug problem, the report said.
   _The government had evidence of numerous drug links involving
the anti-Sandinista rebels, including participation in trafficking
by individual Contras; use of Contra air strips by traffickers; and
the hiring of four airline companies, ``owned and operated by
narcotics traffickers, to supply humanitarian assistance to the
Contras.''
   Before the State Department signed the contracts, the report
said, ``federal law enforcement had received information that the
individuals controlling these companies were involved in
narcotics.''
   ``Even after the State Department was acknowledging there were
problems with drug trafficking in association with Contra
activities on the Southern Front, the Justice Department was
adamantly denying that there was any substance to the narcotics
allegations,'' the report said.
   ``At the time, the FBI had significant information regarding the
involvement of narcotics traffickers in Contra operations and
Neutrality Act violations.''
   Summig up its findings, the committee said, ``Foreign policy
priorities towards the Bahamas, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama at
times delayed, halted, or interfered with U.S. law enforcement's
efforts to keep narcotics out of the United States.''
   Referring specifically to the Contras, the report said, ``The
logic of having drug money pay for the pressing needs of the
Contras appealed to a number of people who became involved in the
covert war. Indeed, senior U.S. policy-makers were not immune to
the idea that drug money was a perfect solution to the Contra's
funding problems.''

<HEAD>Archbishop Sees No Major Changes After Vatican Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen said that a 5{-year
Vatican review of the Seattle Roman Catholic Archdiocese did not
lead to fundamental changes in its operations.
   Hunthausen, who came under fire from Catholic conservatives and
at one time temporarily lost his authority over annulments and in
several other church activities, appeared with Seattle's coadjutor
Archbishop Thomas Murphy at a news conference Wednesday.
   A day earlier, the pope's U.S. representative announced that an
apostolic commission appointed to review Hunthausen's leadership
had completed its work and would be dissolved.
   ``We're delighted. We're relieved. We're pleased,'' Hunthausen
said. ``We're going to have a party.''
   ``I'm not sure the ministry has changed,'' said Hunthausen, who
added that the ministry was never in violation of Rome's teachings
``in the broad sense.''
   A statement issued by Archbishop Pio Laghi in Washington, D.C.,
chief papal representative in the United States, said Hunthausen
``has indicated that he, along with Murphy, will continue to
address the issues which have been of concern to the church.''
   Hunthausen, 67, said after a trip to Rome earlier this year that
he had been assured the review had been completed and that the
apostolic commission, headed by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of
Chicago, would be disbanded.
   The commission, which also included Cardinal John O'Connor of
New York and Archbishop John Quinn of San Francisco, was set up in
January 1987 to review Hunthausen's ministry.
   After Hunthausen came under fire from conservatives, the Vatican
in 1985 removed his authority in five areas where he was accused of
diverging from church teachings, including ministry to homosexuals,
liturgical matters and marriage annulments. An auxiliary bishop,
Donald Wuerl, was appointed to take over those duties.
   When that situation proved unworkable, Hunthausen's authority
was restored in early 1987, Wuerl was relocated, and Murphy, a
bishop in Montana, was named coadjutor archbishop with right of
succession.
   The commission also was named to advise Hunthausen, and it met
with him five times, most recently in October.
   Margaret Hoffman, director of the Sons of St. Peter Coalition, a
conservative group critical of the archbishop's leadership, said
liturgical abuses still occur in the archdiocese. She cited
Hunthausen washing a woman's feet last month in a Holy Week ritual
reminiscent of Jesus' washing of the disciples' feet.

<TEXT>
   A drug derived from a Chinese plant root
selectively killed AIDS-virus infected cells and inhibited virus
reproduction in healthy cells during test-tube experiments,
researchers announced today.
   The scientists working for the University of California at San
Francisco and Genelabs Inc. also have shown for the first time that
macrophages, cells that form the body's first line of immune system
defense, can be reservoirs of infection with the human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS.
   Tests results from about two years of work were reported today
in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Listed as a
co-author was Hin-Wing Yeung, a scientist from Chinese University
of Hong Kong who first brought the chemical to the attention of
researchers in San Francisco.
   The drug, GLQ223, is a highly purified form of the plant protein
trichosanthin, which is found in the root of a Chinese plant from
the cucumber family.
   The scientists cautioned that the drug has not been tried on
people, and that extensive studies will be required to determine
whether it will be safe to administer to AIDS patients. Genelabs of
Redwood City, Calif., has applied to the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for permission to begin human testing.
   The drug has been tested in laboratory animals for toxicity,
said Michael S. McGrath, an assistant professor of medicine and
director of the AIDS-Immunobiology Research laboratory for San
Francisco General Hospital. The animal toxicity results were not
published, and the researchers said the drug had not yet been shown
to kill the virus in the animals.
   The scientists also said they did not know the exact mechanism
by which trichosanthin killed HIV-infected cells and inhibited HIV
reproduction in test tubes.
   After treating HIV-infected blood samples from eight individuals
with a single dose of the GLQ223, the scientists said they found no
macrophages with evidence of virus production five days later. The
drug also inhibited replication of HIV in laboratory cultured
cells, the report said.
   The study showed that 2 percent to 7 percent of macrophages in
the blood of AIDS patients are infected with HIV. Microphages,
which are found in every organ of the body and are difficult to
kill, direct the body's response to infection. Without functioning
macrophages, an individual is more likely to succumb to the
diseases and infections that kill patients with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.

   Lawmakers clashed today over President Bush's
plan to sustain the Nicaraguan Contra rebels with $49.7 million in
non-lethal aid, with opponents charging the package ``hinges on
winks, nods and handshakes.''
   The House debated the compromise plan, which would give the
Contras additional food, clothing and medical assistance but would
bar new money for weapons and ammunition to renew the battle
against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Congress was poised to approve the plan that was hammered out in
weeks of negotiations between Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate.
   Senate consideration of the plan was delayed today when
Republicans declined to say what amendments they planned, according
to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. Democrats
planned no amendments to the agreement.
   ``President Bush telephoned me this morning, urged me to move
this legislation promptly ... and made clear his opposition to any
amendments to the legislation,'' Mitchell said.
   The majority leader called it ironic that members of Bush's
party were unwilling to go along with the agreement worked out by
leaders.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., meanwhile, said he
would oppose all amendments, in keeping with the compromise.
   In the House, Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois urged
support for the agreement, telling his colleagues that what the
agreement ``lacks in perfection it makes up in real effective help
for the cause of progress and democracy in Nicaragua and Central
America.''
   ``I wish we could do better but as legislators it's not given to
us to act only when conditions are perfect,'' Michel said.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said that with the agreement, ``at last we have
what is more than a narrowly based consensus.''
   But Rep. Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., cited the Democratic
contention that continued support for the Contras would derail the
diplomatic peace process.
   Foglietta also said the plan would keep the Contras in place and
not integrate them into Nicaraguan society.
   ``This accord hinges on winks, nods and handshakes,'' he said.
``I'd really like to say I trust this new administration, the Bush
administration, for reintegration of the Contras. But how can I
when I read ... that then-Vice President Bush played a role in
supplying covert aid to the Contras.''
   On Wednesday, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said, ``I think
everybody _ whether they have supported or opposed the Contras in
the past _ knows that this is the end of the Contra war. It's not
going to start up again. The Contra war is over.''
   Leahy commented shortly after the Senate Appropriations
Committee voted 18-2 to recommend the aid package be approved. The
House Appropriations committee earlier voted 34-10 to endorse the
measure.
   Most of the emotional steam that marked nearly a decade of
divisive congressional debate over Contra aid was missing.
   But Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., a longtime Contra aid
supporter, said the accord represents ``nothing more than a show of
surrender.'' Leahy, in turn, characterized Hollings' comments as
``natural bitterness'' shared by many Contra supporters.
   Leahy said the Bush administration is to be commended for
recognizing that former President Reagan's policy of arming the
Contras to serve as surrogates for the United States in Nicaragua
had failed.
   On Wednesday, Baker said approval of the bipartisan plan
represents the only way to get the United States ``back into the
ballgame in Central America.''
   ``Up to now, we have been out of the ballgame because we had the
legislature going in one direction and the executive going in
another direction and we couldn't function,'' Baker told the Senate
Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee. ``Today, for the
first time, we have an opportunity to speak with one voice to the
people of Central America.''
   But Baker said the plan also represents an acid test of whether
the Sandinistas will keep the promises made at the August 1987
accord signed in Guatemala City by five Central American presidents.
   It calls for free and fair elections in Nicaragua and for
democratic reforms, including the removal of restrictions on the
press and the release of political prisoners.
   The aid plan also calls for spending an additional $4.2 million
for medical assistance for civilian victims of the war in Nicaragua
and earmarks an additional $5 million for the Agency for
International Development (AID) for operating expenses in conveying
the new aid to the Contras.
   The plan also permits some of the aid money to be used for the
voluntary reintegration of the Contras into Nicaraguan society or
their relocation elsewhere in the region.
   Although the aid funds are to be approved through February of
next year, Congress will be given an opportunity in November to
review the situation and halt the aid if it sees fit.

   Gov. Mike Sullivan opened a three-day

   ``I would hope that George Bush's vision of a kinder and gentler
nation does not envision burning someone's back yard and then
charging them for the privilege,'' he said.
   Wildfires spurred by high heat and drought eventually burned
across nearly half of the park's 2.2 million acres.
   Sullivan said cooperation among state and federal agencies in
managing the world's first national park is being sorely tested by
Bush's proposal to pay for last summer's firefighting with the
state's share of federal mineral royalties, money paid to the
government for mining and oil drilling on federal land.
   ``Bluntly stated, this idea is feudalism and not federalism.
Western states are not vassals on some vast medieval estate owned
by absentee landlords in Washington, but this proposal would treat
us as such,'' Sullivan said.
   The governor, who is a Democrat, said he has urged that this
``ill-conceived idea'' be reconsidered.
   The symposium featuring speakers from across the nation is to
discuss various issues involving managing land and wildlife in the
Greater Yellowstone area. About 300 people attended the first
morning of the conference, which runs through Saturday morning.
   Sullivan said management of the more than 12 million acres of
federal land in and around Yellowstone is complicated by a mix of
land forms and controls, including 85 federal laws and executive
orders.
   ``These mandates vary widely, from the strict constraints in the
wilderness acts to the more production-oriented multiple-use laws.
Additionally, nine major forest plans and park master plans guide
the management of individual administrative units in the region,''
he said.
   Part of the conference's mission is to discuss how management of
the park can be coordinated better.
   Sullivan said he hoped participants would consider how to
protect the economy of Wyoming while protecting the future of the
park.
   ``The national parks and wilderness areas contribute
significantly to the tourism industry becoming increasingly
important to a state reeling from the impacts on energy and
agriculture economies,'' he said.

   Jewish extremists taking the name of biblical
assassins have stepped out of the shadows, waging arson attacks on
liberal Jews and claiming the machine gun slaying of an Arab.
   Experts say the acts reflect right-wing Israeli frustrations
over the army's inability to put down the Palestinian uprising and
may indicate the creation of a new Jewish underground.
   The group, named after first century Jewish zealots known as the
Sicarites, claimed their first shooting attack Monday when an
Israeli dressed in army fatigues opened fire with an Uzi submachine
gun on four Arabs outside Jerusalem's walled Old City.
   Khaled Shawish, a 26-year-old blacksmith, was killed and three
other Palestinians suffered moderate to serious wounds. The gunman
escaped.
   A caller speaking Hebrew with a French or North African accent
claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the Sicarites
and said it was to avenge Jewish victims of stoning attacks in the
16-month Palestinian revolt.
   A day later, five bullets were left on the doorstep of a Jewish
woman from Jerusalem known for her friendship with an Arab family.
Slogans said it was the work of the Sicarites and threatened to
harm her daughter if the woman did not end her contact with Arabs.
   The group has also taken responsibility for eight arson attacks
since February on apartments or cars belonging to left-wing
Israelis. There were no casualties.
   The targeting of modern-day Jews sympathetic to Palestinians
echoes the activities of the ancient Sicarites, who used curved
daggers, called ``sica'' in Latin, to murder fellow Jews accused of
collaborating with the Romans.
   But although police described the initial arson attacks as
amateur in execution, they said the attack against the Arabs
represented a radical escalation in the Sicarites' method of
operation.
   Indicating the seriousness with which police are treating the
organization's claims, a top police investigator, District
Superintendent Yehuda Vilk, has been appointed to the case.
   Vilk headed an investigation in February that uncovered the
leaders of Keshet, a group of militant ultra-Orthodox Jews who used
bombs, arson and grenades to enforce observance of religious laws
on secular Israelis.
   Police Commissioner David Krauss said the investigation is
complicated by the fact that information on the group has been
limited to its own telephoned claims of responsibility.
   ``We know of the existence of this group only from telephone
conversations in which they called themselves the Sicarites,''
Krauss said. ``It's still early to say whether such an organization
exists or who its members are.''
   The Sicarites' ideology, as expressed in graffiti and telephone
messages, includes opposition to giving up any of the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip as well as any form of dialogue with
Palestinians.
   Even hardline Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who opposes any
territorial compromise, had been described in Sicarite graffiti as
``a traitor who will return Jewish land to Arab hands.''
   Ehud Sprintzak, a Hebrew University political scientist and
expert on Jewish extremism, said the group is most likely composed
of a handful of religious fanatics who support the banned anti-Arab
Kach party led by Brooklyn, N.Y.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane.
   Kahane decribed Monday's attack as a natural act of revenge by
``frustrated and angry'' Jews. He favors expelling all Arabs from
Israel and the occupied territories, which he insists Israel should
annex.
   ``The ground is fertile for a group like this,'' said Sprintzak,
who warned Sicarite activities could increase as feelings of
powerlessness grew over Israel's inability to contain the
Palestinian uprising.
   ``They realize the only thing that can prevent a peace process
are provocations,'' Sprintzak said.
   Ariel Merari, a leading terrorism expert from Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, compared the
Sicarites to the Jewish underground of the early 1980s.
   The group carried out a series of attacks on Palestinian targets
between 1980 and 1984, including the maiming of two Arab mayors and
a shooting at Hebron's Islamic University that left three Arabs
dead and 30 wounded.
   Most of the 27 Israelis convicted for their role in the attacks
have since been freed after having their sentences reduced.
   ``I think the time is right for this kind of group,'' Merari
said of the Sicarites. ``The uprising has been going on for over a
year and it is causing frustration and polarization among the
Jewish public.''

<TEXT>
   Charles Lewis, former Virgin Islands official
and friend of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry Jr., was
indicted today on 10 felony counts stemming from Barry's visits to
his hotel room last December.
   The grand jury indicted Lewis, who also is facing cocaine
possession charges in the Virgin Islands, on three counts of
cocaine possession and seven counts of giving false statements to
the grand jury.
   The perjury charges center on questions Lewis was asked about
visits Barry made to his hotel room and what went on there,
according to sources close to the case.
   On Dec. 22 police were inexplicably called off an attempt to
make an undercover drug purchase from Lewis, 48, a former city
government employee, after Barry showed up at his hotel room. Barry
has acknowledged contacting police officials looking into the
affair but has said he was only trying to speed up the probe.
   The grand jury also was hearing testimony on a joint personnel
project involving the D.C. and Virgin Islands governments. Lewis,
the project's director, was fired a year ago after Virgin Islands
officials expressed concern about cost overruns.
   Lewis is in the Virgin Islands awaiting trial April 17 on two
counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to
distribute.
   He was arrested March 3 in a St. Thomas hotel room after
allegedly selling 24 bags of crack cocaine to a female FBI
undercover agent.
   Barry, who has described Lewis as a friend, had no comment on
the indictment.

   Federal investigators have identified several
passengers who may have unwittingly carried aboard the bomb that
blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland on Dec. 21, a Bush
administration official said today.
   CBS-TV news reported Wednesday that suspicion for having planted
the bomb was focused on a member of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command who is a relative of Hafez
Dalkamoni, who CBS said reportedly set up the network that carried
out the attack.
   An administration official knowledgeable about the investigation
disputed the CBS account that investigators believe the passenger
who unwittingly carried the bomb was Khalid Jaafar, a young
American-Lebanese college student returning to Michigan from
Frankfurt for the Christmas holidays.
   Federal Bureau of Investigation agents have questioned Jaafar's
parents at the family-run gas station in Detroit but the parents
insist he was not involved.
   The official said Jaafar was only one of several passengers
suspected of unwittingly bringing the explosive aboard. ``And no
one in the Popular Front is talking,'' said the official, who spoke
on conditionof anonymity.
   Another government source said the ``chief theory'' of
investigators is that the bombing was the work of the
Syrian-sponsored Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   Investigators theorize that the terrorist group, headed by Ahmed
Jibril, may have carried out the attack at the request of Iran,
said the source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Meanwhile, the lord advocate of Scotland, Lord Fraser, said in a
statement in London that ``there has been a narrowing in the focus
of the inquiry but it would be inadvisable for me to comment on
these reports at this stage.''
   CBS said many of the leads in the case are coming from a member
of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine who is
cooperating with investigators.
   It said the Popular Front has its headquarters in Syria but the
investigation has uncovered evidence linking the Pan Am bombing to
Iran.
   The London Daily Telegraph reported investigators have narrowed
the number of people suspected of having been duped into carrying
the bomb aboard to between three and five American passport holders
who probably joined the flight in Frankfurt.
   It said FBI agents are searching European cities to find the
terrorist who gave the passenger the radio-cassette player in which
investigators have confirmed the bomb was placed.
   The Pan Am jumbo jet crashed in southern Scotland, killing all
259 people aboard and 11 other people on the ground.
   Dalkamoni was in prison at the time of the bombing, having been
picked up last October following a raid on one of his safe houses.
Along with weapons, German police found three Toshiba radio
cassette players similar to the one used to blow up Pan Am 103, CBS
said.

<HEAD>Police Thwart Hostage Incident at Prison; Kill Inmate</HEAD>

   Two armed convicts fled a high-security prison
colony in a bus after seizing eight hostages, but police killed one
of the men and wounded the other, and all captives were released
unharmed, Tass said Thursday.
   The men _ one a convicted murderer and the other a convicted
robber _ entered the Ukrainian prison colony's administrative
building Wednesday morning armed with homemade firearms and knives,
the official news agency said.
   The incident occurred about 500 miles south of Moscow in the
Voroshilovgrad region.
   According to Tass, the men took eight female employees hostage,
then barricaded themselves in the building and demanded a bus and
guarantees they would be allowed to leave the prison.
   Regional police and KGB chiefs began negotiating with the
inmates and persuaded them to release two hostages, ``but the
criminals wouldn't set the others free unless authorities agreed to
their demands,'' Tass said.
   It identified the inmates as V. Maximov, serving a 15-year term
for murder and theft, and O. Korzh, sentenced to eight years in
prison for robbery and malicious hooliganism. It said both were
repeat offenders.
   After authorities decided to meet the demands, a bus took the
men and their remaining hostages out of the penal colony.
Authorities tried again to negotiate with the men as the bus neared
the highway, Tass said.
   The criminals then demanded the release of another inmate and
threatened to kill one of the hostages immediately if the demand
was not met. At that point, police decided to act, Tass said.
   ``A carefully planned operation sprang into life,'' it said.
``Korzh was killed on the spot and Maximov wounded.'' It said all
the hostages were freed unharmed.
   On Dec. 1, a team of men commandeered a bus of children on a
field trip to the Caucasus city of Ordzhonikidze, and traded them
for drugs, money and a flight to Israel. Israel, which has no
diplomatic relations with Moscow, allowed the plane to land, but
deported the hijackers the next day. The four men, plus an
accomplice, were sentenced to prison terms of up to 15 years on
March 17.

   President Bush will travel to a
Polish-American community in Michigan to announce economic aid
measures aimed at demonstrating U.S. gratitude for reform steps
undertaken by the communist government in Warsaw, an administration
source said today.
   This official, declining to be named publicly, said Bush will
visit the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck, which is roughly 60 percent
Polish-American, to outline the administration's plans on Monday.
   Another official, also speaking anonymously, said consideration
is being given to a trip by Bush to Poland, although no time frame
was suggested. ``The option is still in abeyance,'' the official
said, adding that no trip plans would be announced during Monday's
Michigan appearance. Bush visited Poland in September 1987, just
days before formally announcing his presidential candidacy.
   The Warsaw government recently reached agreement with Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa to legalize the trade union movement that was
outlawed during a martial law crackdown in 1981 and scheduled the
first free elections in the country since the end of World War II.
   Bush hailed the April 5 accord, and administration officials had
signaled in recent days that plans were afoot to reward the Warsaw
government with unspecified economic measures.
   Speculation has centered on granting Poland trade advantages
under the General System of Preferences (GSP) and taking steps to
encourage private investment in the Eastern European nation through
the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
   A U.S. aid package to economically beleaguered Poland could
include tariff exemptions under the GSP that would increase exports
to the United States.
   The trip Monday would be Bush's first visit to Michigan since
being elected president last November.
   ``The president needed a backdrop to address the Polish-American
community about the changes in Poland,'' Hamtramck City Council
President Paul Odrobina told the Detroit Free Press. He said White
House advance personnel told him that Bush ``wants to make an
announcement about the American government's policy toward Poland.''
   In 1981 and 1982, the U.S. government imposed economic sanctions
against Poland following the declaration of martial law and the
outlawing of Solidarity.
   Some sanctions were lifted in 1987, after the Polish government
moved toward a reconciliation with the union.

   The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103
will cost the airline about $50 million, a company official said
Thursday.
   That estimate includes the loss of the Boeing 747, a drop in
passenger traffic on some routes and the anticipated cost of
lawsuits filed after the crash on Dec. 21, said Peter T. McHugh,
senior vice president for marketing for Pan American World Airways.
   ``We don't have the exact figures yet, but we expect that sum to
be about $50 million,'' McHugh told reporters.
   Bookings have rebounded somewhat, however, because of the
Eastern Airlines strike, which ``amounted to an increased earnings
of $50 million,'' he said.
   McHugh said the losses from the bombing would not threaten the
airline because Pan Am had a cash reserve fund of $285 million at
the end of 1988.
   According to McHugh, the airline expects to spend about $15
million this year to improve security, plus an additional $6
million for installation of more devices to detect plastic
explosives.
   British officials have traced the crash of Flight 103 to what
they believe was a radio cassette player packed with plastic
explosives and an air pressure-sensitive detonator. The plane
exploded as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259
aboard and 11 people on the ground.
   Pan Am bookings decreased by 10 percent during the first quarter
of this year because of the Lockerbie crash, said Siegfried
Ruffert, head of Pan Am's office in Frankfurt.

   Sugar Ray Robinson was
pound-for-pound the world's greatest boxer whose influence extended
far beyond the rings he dominated for much of 25 years, friends
said after his death at age 67.
   ``He was one of the finest human beings who ever lived, even a
better person than a prizefighter,'' said Sid Lockitch, Robinson's
business manager for 19 years.
   ``He was charitable, he cared very deeply for children,''
Lockitch said, referring to the Sugar Ray Youth Foundation, founded
in 1969 in Los Angeles.
   Robinson, whose 175-19-6 record included 110 knockouts in his
career, died Wednesday, apparently of natural causes shortly after
being taken to Brotman Memorial Medical Center.
   His death was caused by heart disease, said Bob Dambacher, a
spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. A
post-mortem examination also confirmed he suffered from Alzheimer's
disease and diabetes.
   Boxing's original Sugar Ray influenced fighters from Muhammad
Ali to Sugar Ray Leonard.
   ``I idolized the man,'' Leonard said of Robinson. ``Someone once
said there was a comparison between Sugar Ray Leonard and Sugar Ray
Robinson. Believe me, there's no comparison. Sugar Ray Robinson was
the greatest.''
   ``Generations of fighters copied his style, including Muhammad
Ali,'' said Archie Moore, former light heavyweight champion and a
friend for nearly 50 years. ``Ali got a lot of his style from
Robinson. ... We'll all miss him. I know I'll miss him.''
   Robinson fought his first fight Oct. 4, 1940, and his last at
age 44 on Nov. 10, 1965, losing a 10-round decision to Joey Archer.
   In that span, the flashy fighter was involved in some of the
most memorable bouts.
   And he was as flashy outside the ring as inside it. He owned a
Harlem nightclub and drove a flamingo-pink Cadillac. On his boxing
tours of Europe during his peak, his entourage included a valet, a
barber who doubled as his golf pro, and several family members as
well as his trainers.
   ``Money is for spending,'' he once said.
   Robinson was born on May 3, 1921, in Detroit, Mich., as Walker
Smith Jr.
   As a teen-age amateur boxer, he borrowed the card of a young
fighter named Ray Robinson. Once his Sugar Ray nickname stuck, he
never used his real name again.
   He was elected to the Boxing Hall of Fame in 1967.
   ``Sugar Ray Robinson was The Man, along with Joe Louis,'' former
heavyweight champion Larry Holmes. ``Those two guys opened the door
for the rest of us.
   ``Anytime you get into a conversation about old-time greats,
those are the two people everyone talks about.''
   Even Louis, the renowned Brown Bomber and former heavyweight
champion, once called Robinson ``the greatest fighter ever to step
into the ring.''
   Indeed, Robinson inspired the phrase, ``pound for pound, the
best,'' a description intended to transcend the weight divisions.
   Robinson won the vacant world welterweight title on Dec. 20,
1946, with a 15-round decision over Tommy Bell and never lost a
fight to a welterweight the rest of his career.
   He also won the middleweight title, stopping Jake LaMotta in the
13th round on Feb. 14, 1951, in Chicago. That was the sixth time
the two fighters had met, with Robinson winning five. It also was
the only time they did not fight to the distance in one of the most
brutal rivalries in boxing history.
   By the time Robinson met the ``Raging Bull'' for the last time,
he was almost 30 years old and his record already was 119-1-2, yet
he fought for another 14 years.
   Another of Robinson's most memorable rivalries was against Gene
Fullmer, whom he had beaten only once in four meetings.
   Robinson lost the middleweight title to Fullmer on Jan. 2, 1957,
on a 15-round decision, then regained it on May 1 in Chicago with
one of the most famous one-punch knockouts in boxing history,
ending that fight in the fifth round.
   He and Fullmer fought to a draw on Dec. 3, 1960, and he lost a
15-round decision to Fullmer on March 4, 1961, in Las Vegas.
   Besides his wife, Millie, Robinson is survived by a son from an
earlier marriage, Ray Jr., two stepchildren _ Ramona Lewis and
Butch Robinson _ four grandchildren and a sister, Evelyn Nelson of
New York.

<HEAD>Walesa Pressed To Run For Presidency</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to CORRECT that Walesa says he considering the presidency,
not a seat in the newly created Senate. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa _ whose Solidarity trade union
helped force the government to adopt sweeping, democratic reforms _
said today his supporters want him to run for the newly created
post of president.
   In a telephone interview from his home in Gdansk, Walesa said he
would not run in June for a seat on the newly created Senate. But
he said he may not refuse if a member of the existing Sejm or the
new Senate nominates him when the two houses of parliament meet
later this year to elect a new president.
   If that doesn't happen, Walesa said, he will probably run in the
next presidential election scheduled six years from now.
   ``I am a man of big interests,'' he said. ``I'm being strongly
pressed ... And I plan to be a candidate for the highest government
body (presidency) that is going to be in Poland.''
   Before today, the electrician, who won the Nobel Peace Prize
after founding Solidarity, had said he wanted to concentrate on
union issues.
   ``Solidarity plans to win these elections as much as is
possible. The elections will tell exactly who is right. I wish well
to all. Let the better candidates win,'' Walesa told reporters at
his home earlier today.
   Also today, Solidarity filed an application with the government
requesting that it be made legal again after a seven-year ban.
   In another development, Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, met with Roman Catholic primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp to
discuss relations between his communist government and the dominant
religion in Poland.
   Walesa said he expects the Warsaw Regional Court, where
Solidarity applied today, to register the union by Monday, thus
formally ending the ban.
   ``We are in a very good mood,'' Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the
opposition leader who negotiated trade union freedoms, told
reporters outside the court after he filed the application for
Solidarity.
   ``We do hope registration will take place within the nearest
days, that the factory and local commissions will be able to get
organized without any obstacles, and Solidarity will return to life
as a powerful union,'' he said.
   Today's events were made possible by a historic agreement
reached April 5 by communist authorities and the opposition.
   After two months of talks, the government agreed to legalize
Solidarity in exchange for the union's participation in elections
which still guarantee the communist-led coalition a majority.
   Solidarity, which has previously advocated election boycotts,
met today to discuss which candidates it will support.
   The voting will create a new 100-member Senate. Opposition
candidates also can run for 35 percent of the 460 seats in the
existing Sejm. The rest will be guaranteed for the communist-led
coalition. Anyone who can get 3,000 voters' signatures can run in
the elections.
   The PAP state news agency reported today the balloting will take
place June 4 with run-off voting June 18.
   PAP reported that Jaruzelski and Glemp discussed regularizing
the status of the church, relations between the government and
Vatican and the elections.
   Work on a law to regulate the legal status of the church and
``pave the wave for full normalization of relations between Poland
and the Holy See'' has been completed, said a joint communique
published by PAP.
   Vatican sources last year said the Polish government offered to
provide a legal basis for church activities in exchange for
establishing diplomatic relations. An agreement that existed
between the church and Polish government before World War II was
not renewed after the communists seized power.

   Nearly 2,000 Barclays Bank employees
Thursday defied a government order to end a week-old strike that
has closed all 18 branches of the country's largest commercial bank.
   The employees are protesting a proposed new salary structure
that would give 20 percent increases to senior employees but only
10 percent increases to clerks and other junior staff. The
employees' union is demanding a 20 percent raise for all.
   On Wednesday, Labor Minister Englishman Kgabo declared the
strike illegal and ordered employees to return to work. He did not
specify what action would be taken against the strikers if they did
not obey, but participants in an illegal walkout can be punished by
fines or jail terms.

   Police on Thursday shot and killed two gunmen who
tried to rob a post office storage area using a steel battering-ram
welded to a van.
   A third gunman was wounded and a police marksman was shot in the
foot in a gun battle near the post office, located in the northwest
suburb of Harrow, Scotland Yard said.
   Police chased the gunmen to a nearby street and ordered them to
surrender. The gunmen opened fire and police returned their shots,
police said.
   The men had smashed their way into the post office but aborted
the robbery after failing to get into an area where valuables were
kept, police said.

   Forget Washington's Birthday or the Fourth
of July. For 14 young Americans, the most memorable holiday this
year will be next week's birthday of Vladimir Lenin, the leader of
the Russian Revolution.
   ``On George Washington's birthday all we do is get a day off
from school,'' said 11-year-old Doug DiBlasio, one of 14 Sacandaga
Elementary School students who are heading to Moscow on Friday.
``They (Soviet children) dress up in costumes and do other special
things for Lenin's birthday.''
   Organizers say the 12-day trip is the first American exchange
involving elementary school children.
   Jim Pasquille, one of six adult chaperones, said the trip is
intended to give the students a view of Soviet people unadulterated
by the news media or government propaganda.
   ``We want to show that it's possible to have an exchange program
at this young an age,'' said Pasquille, assistant director of the
state University of Albany's International Program. ``If we get
them over there now, hopefully they'll come back with a more open
mind and won't be afraid in the future to try new things.''
   The students, from grades 4 to 6, will spend most of their time
with children at a school in Moscow. The group also will visit the
Kremlin, Red Square and Leningrad.
   Each student is taking gifts for their Soviet counterparts and
the children have prepared a music program that includes ``That's
What Friends Are For'' and ``The Greatest Love of All.''
   ``Both those songs are about friendship, and that's what we're
trying to do, make friends,'' said Sumantha Banerjee, 12.
   ``It's government that really separates the way people act,''
she said. ``They're the same nice people as us, most of us, some of
us.''
   The 14 students, chosen from more than 50 who wrote essays on
why they wanted to visit the Soviet Union, have been studying
Russian language and culture for four to six hours a week after
school.
   Organizers have invited pupils from the Moscow school to visit
Scotia, near Albany, next November.

   A pair of Navy training jets crashed today
in a rural area, killing two pilots, officials said. Two other
airman ejected from the planes and were taken to a hospital.
   The Navy did not say whether the two aircraft had collided when
the crash occurred at approximately 9 a.m., some 50 miles north of
the Meridian Naval Air Station. However, Lt. j.g. Mary Chamberlain,
spokeswoman at the station, did confirm that the two planes were
involved in a training mission at the time.
   She said both planes went down in about the same area, which
local authorities said was near the U.S. 45 Bypass highway about
seven miles south of Macon in rural east-central Mississippi.
   The names of the airmen were not released pending notification
of relatives, said Chamberlain.
   There was no immediate word on the two survivors, who were flown
by search and rescue helicopters to Noxubee General Hospital in
Macon, a few miles north of the crash site. Officials at the
hospital declined to give information on the conditions of the two.
   Chamberlain said the airmen were members of air station's
Training Squadron 19 and two piots each were in T-2C Buckeye jets,
aircraft used to train Navy and Marine pilots.
   Chamberlain said local and state authorities had joined air
station rescue personnel in rushing to the crash site. She said an
investigation into the crash was already under way.
   Witnesses reported seeing at least three parachutes, but Navy
officials could not confirm that report.

   Researchers who developed a drug to dissolve
blood clots in heart attack victims were honored Thursday as
Inventors of the Year for 1989.
   David V. Goeddel, William J. Kohr, Diane Pennica and Gordon A.
Vehar, researchers for Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco,
Calif., shared the honor presented annually by the Intellectual
Property Owners Foundation, which represents holders of patents,
copyrights and trademarks.
   The team developed the drug known as t-PA _ human tissue
plasminogen activator. It is used to help dissolve blood clots
immediately following heart attacks.
   The foundation, which works to encourage innovation, announced
its awards at a news conference. The winners of the top award will
share a $4,000 prize.
   ``Invention is the heart of American society,'' commented Robert
P. Freese, one of several other inventors also honored by the
foundation.
   Among those listed as ``distinguished'' inventors of 1989 were
Freese and several co-workers who developed an optical computer
storage disk capable of holding up to 1,000 times more information
than the popular floppy disks now in use.
   Developers of the disk were Freese, Richard N. Gardner and
Thomas A. Rinehart of Alphatronix Inc., at Research Triangle Park,
N.C., and Leslie H. Johnson of the 3M Company in St. Paul, Minn.
   Others receiving distinguished inventor honors were:
   _James L. Ferguson of Menlo Park, Calif., who invented a device
using liquid crystals to protect eyes from laser beams.
   Ferguson said his product scatters laser light and can be used
to protect scientists working in laboratories and also to help
military personnel who could be blinded by laser weapons or even by
laser range-finding devices.
   _Charles A. Chidsey of Boulder, Wyo., and Guinter Kahn of North
Miami Beach, Fla., who developed minoxidil, a drug to treat
baldness.
   Kahn said development of the drug has not curtailed ``snake oil
salesmen'' who have been peddling fake baldness cures for thousands
of years.

   A church historian who for a quarter century has
kept in first-hand touch with Soviet religion says it is gaining
stature and prerogatives never before deemed possible under
Communism.
   ``The pace of change is really quite startling,'' says the Rev.
V. Bruce Rigdon of Grosse Pointe, Mich. ``One could have never
predicted these changes would come so quickly.''
   Rigdon, a Presbyterian and chairman of the National Council of
Churches U.S-Soviet Church Relations Working Group, added in a
telephone interview:
   ``There is some evidence of something that is beginning to look
like a religious revival occurring in many places in the Soviet
Union, especially among young people.''
   Noting that several religious leaders were elected members of
the new Soviet parliament, Rigdon said:
   ``This means that for the first time church leaders, people who
are not members of the Communist party, will participate in the new
parliament. It's a new fact of life.''
   He said those elected include Russian Orthodox Patriarch Pimen,
Metropolitan Pitirim, head of church publishing; Leningrad
Metroplitan Alexei and Armenian Catholicos Vaskin I.
   ``The image of electing bishops and being represented by bishops
in parliament is something nobody there had ever experienced before
_ the freedom to choose,'' Rigdon said.
   Having led church delegations on visits there since 1961, most
recently in February, arranging a new, extensive program of church
cooperation between the two countries, Rigdon cited these other
developments:
   _ About 1,000 new churches were opened in 1988, compared to 15
in 1987. Currently, three to five additional churches are being
opened daily, with about 1,500 expected to be opened in 1989.
   _ Seven new seminaries are planned for opening this fall,
besides the three already operating, bringing the number to 10
seminaries, plus two advanced theological academies.
   _ Russian Orthodoxy is acquiring its own printing press and
facilities for producing films and records, giving it unprecedented
communications capabilities.
   _ Allowed by the government for the first time, lay volunteers
and clergy now visit hospitals and mental institutions to provide
assistance and counseling encouragement.
   _ Churches hold catechism classes for teaching new members,
something not allowed before, with some parishes ``now doing
something very much like Sunday school'' for the young, also
previously forbidden.
   ``In every area, Soviet life is undergoing change, but none is
at a more remarkable pace than the changes in religious life,''
Rigdon said. ``Numbers of people now are coming to church for the
first time.
   ``The church, which for so long had to concentrate on survival,
now faces a very difficult task. The issue is whether it can
communicate the gospel powerfully enough to people who have not
heard it before to change their lives.
   ``This is never easy for any church.''
   Rigdon, 53, veteran church historian at McCormick Theological
Seminary and now pastor of Grosse Pointe's Memorial Presbyterian
Church, is among the most knowledgeable Americans about Soviet
religious life.
   Over the last 28 years, he has led about 70 visits there, and is
personally acquainted with Soviet church leaders and pastors,
Orthodox, Baptist, Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Pentecostal
and Jewish.
   ``The change that the churches have experienced is part of a
larger picture that is all utterly dependent on the continuation of
policies of (Soviet leader) Gorbachev,'' Rigdon said.
   ``In this sense, Americans should do everything possible to
encourage stabilizing these processes. It is clear that as the
opposition to Gorbachev gets larger, there is a certain
precariousness about it all.
   ``He may have two or three years to strengthen the economy, to
get it producing needs in larger quantity, and if he doesn`t Mr.
Gorbachev's `perestroika'' is in great trouble.
   ``Reformers are rare in Russian history. They don't last long.
We can hope he's an exception. We should recognize the opportunity,
and give every sort of support possible to make sure that what
Grobachev represents succeeds.''
   In the February meeting, the U.S. and Soviet church leaders
noted that their first meetings began three decades ago at the
height of the Cold War and added in a joint statement:
   ``The Christians of our countries were actually the first people
to melt the ice of mistrust between our two nations. We are facing
a new situation. Our societies are undergoing changes.''
   They pledged expanded cooperation, including:
   Exchanges of theological students and professors, contacts
between congregations in ``sister cities,'' joint publishing,
audio-visual and TV projects, common efforts in emergencies and
disarmament talks, cooperation with ``Third World'' partners, joint
youth conferences and work camps.
   ``We've reached a new stage for the job,'' Rigdon said. ``We
agreed on 15 things we can do together over the next five years,
things that couldn't even have been discussed before.''

<HEAD>Government Arrests Dissident, 1,000 Protesters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government arrested a dissident
clergyman Thursday on the plane that brought him home from an
illegal trip to North Korea and detained about 1,000 people who
protested the action.
   Intelligence agents boarded a commercial flight from Tokyo and
arrested the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, 71, for violating security laws by
visiting communist North Korea and discussing reunification with
President Kim Il Sung.
   His traveling companion, Yoo Won-ho, also was arrested. They
were led from the jet's rear door and taken away.
   Officials said Moon would be questioned by the Agency for
National Security Planning, the main intellligence agency.
   South Korean law allows Moon to be interrogated for 10 days
before he is turned over to prosecutors, who have 40 days to
investigate before indictment. Officials said a trial was expected
in late July or early August.
   Prosecutors said Moon would be charged with visiting North Korea
to receive instructions from a hostile government and with
``praising anti-state elements.'' Penalties range from five years
to death, but it is unlikely he would e executed.
   Moon visited Pyongyang, capital of North Korea, on March 25 and
met with Kim about reuniting the peninsula, which has been divided
since World War II. It is illegal for South Koreans to visit North
Korea without government approval.
   North Korea has said relations would be harmed if South Korea
arrested Moon, who is an adviser to the United National Democratic
Movement, the largest dissident movement.
   Kim's government already postponed a political meeting Tuesday
with South Korea without giving a reason.
   The South Korean government of President Roh Tae-woo has cracked
down on dissidents, arresting five leaders in the past week, and is
reassesing its policy toward the North. Officials in Seoul have
indicated they may delay all talks, including a meeting on sports
scheduled for Tuesday.
   Lee Hong-koo, the national unification minister, said the
clergyman's trip should not affect basic policy toward North Korea,
but indicated the pace of talks may be slowed.
   He said Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon and other officials would
meet Friday to consider policy toward the North.
   About 6,000 radical students held violent protests of the arrest
in at least seven cities Thursday, fighting with riot officers who
blocked them from marching off their campuses, authorities reported.
   They said 1,053 protesters were arrested in Seoul, Pusan,
Kwangju, Chonju, Taegu, Chunchon and Inchon, but most were released.
   Police detained 700 radicals who tried to reach Yonsei
University in Seoul for a rally to welcome Moon. Fifty students
were arrested after about 1,000 marched off the campus and were
greeted with volleys of tear gas.
   Students at four other colleges in Seoul hurled firebombs and
rocks at police, who fired tear gas and threw the rocks back at
them. About 3,000 students clashed with police in the southern port
of Pusan and 2,000 fought riot squads in Kwangju, also in the south.
   Protesters shouted: ``Murderer Roh Tae-woo cannot arrest Moon
Ik-hwan!'' About 12,000 riot police were deployed at Kimpo Airport
and other locations in Seoul. At the airport, officers arrested
about 60 dissidents who got into the terminal through the cordon,
then unfurled banners and yelled slogans.
   South Korean officials say North Korea's dealings with Moon were
an attempt to undermine the Seoul government's authority. They
claim that Moon and other dissidents aid North Korean attempts to
gain control of the entire peninsula.
   Moon's visit appears to have damaged the dissident movement by
linking it to North Korea, which began a three-year war in 1950 by
invading South Korea. Dissident leaders have defended the trip
publicly, but concede privately that it damaged their credibility.

   A jury found two former California
business executives guilty of conspiracy and wire fraud today in
the first trial stemming from the government's investigation of
Pentagon procurement practices.
   But the jury, which deliberated more than 35 hours over four
days, found George Kaub and Eugene Sullivan, along with a third
defendant, innocent of bribery charges.
   Dale Schnittjer was acquitted on the bribery charges, along with
four other counts. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on one
other conspiracy count and one wire fraud count against Schnittjer
and the judge ordered those counts dropped.
   Kaub and Sullivan were convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud
and Kaub was also found guilty on two counts of filing false
statements.
   Kaub, Sullivan and Schnittjer were all vice presidents of
Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., a defense contractor.
The government claimed they conspired to hire a private consultant
who in turn bribed a Navy engineer in order to help the firm obtain
a $24 million contract to build hand-held radar test equipment.
   The defense argued the businessmen were unwillingly duped by
private consultant William Parkin, who actually arranged for the
scheme. The defendants knew nothing about illegal efforts to obtain
inside information on the contract that Teledyne was awarded in
July 1987, defense attorneys said.
   The jury agreed with the government that Kaub and Sullivan had
engaged in a consipracy with Parkin and his associates, all of whom
pleaded guilty in advance of the trial before U.S. District Judge
Richard Williams.
   Kaub and Sullivan were each found guilty of one count of
conspiracy. In addition, Kaub was convicted on five counts of wire
fraud, while Sullivan was convicted on three wire fraud counts.
Those charges stem from the wiretapped conversations between the
defendants and private consultants, which were played for the jury
and formed a central part of the government's evidence.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Kaub was also convicted of filing false statements, charges that
derived from papers he authorized to be sent to the Defense
Department stating that Teledyne had not used private consultants
to work on the contract.
   Each of the counts carries a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and $250,000 in fines. Kaub faces a maximum sentence of 40
years in jail and a maximum fine of $2 million; Sullivan, 20 years
and $1 million.
   Williams set sentencing for June 7 and allowed the defendants to
remain free on bail.
   Parkin, Fred Lackner and Stuart Berlin, a Navy official, all
pleaded guilty in the case before the federal trial began last
week. They cooperated with the government, as did Teledyne
Industries, the parent of Teledyne Electronics. Teledyne entered a
guilty plea in advance of the trial to counts of conspiracy and
filing false statements.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica said he was pleased with
the verdict and that it represented ``significant convictions.'' He
said the government's investigation into the Pentagon procurement
process is ``expanding and continuing.''
   Attorneys for Kaub and Sullivan said they would appeal the
guilty convictions.

<HEAD>Rushdie-Inspired Play Prepares London Bow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new play inspired by the controversy over Salman
Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' opens in London next week to
counter what one of its two authors, himself Moslem-born, refers to
as a ``climate of fear.''
   ``Iranian Nights'' begins a 10-day run on April 19 at the Royal
Court Theater. It was written by Howard Brenton, the left-wing
English playwright, and Tariq Ali, an Oxford-educated Pakistani
who, like Rushdie, was born a Moslem.
   Ali said the three-character play, inspired by the ``Arabian
Nights'' stories, aims to promote a fuller, more ``educative''
vision of Islam than the fanatical image conveyed by Islamic
fundamentalism.
   It was written as a direct response to the plight of Rushdie, a
naturalized British citizen born in India. His novel, ``The Satanic
Verses,'' has been widely condemned as blasphemous, and it provoked
a death threat against the author Feb. 14 from Iran's spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   ``My feeling is that if the play goes as successfully as I hope
it will, it will enable people to lose some of their fear,'' said
Ali, who believes reasoned discussion is still possible among
Moslems despite the extremist actions advocated by Khomeini and his
followers.
   Describing himself as ``a lapsed Moslem,'' Ali said: ``The aim
of the play is to open up debate, clear the air, move forward with
ease'' in examining the many facets of Islam.
   He also hopes the play will be seen in the United States, and he
said producer Joseph Papp ``has been informed about it.''
   ``Iranian Nights'' marks the playwriting debut of Ali, 45, a
writer, broadcaster, and political analyst who emigrated to Britain
from Lahore, Pakistan, in 1963. Brenton, 46, co-wrote with David
Hare the 1985 hit satire ``Pravda.'' His other plays include ``The
Romans in Britain,'' ``The Churchill Play,'' and last year's
``Greenland.''
   Their play will run for 10 performances prior to the theater's
main production, Caryl Churchill's ``Icecream.''
   But its debut follows some concern over subject matter that led
to the resignation prior to rehearsals of two of its three actors,
a change of title, and exhaustive board meetings at a theater that
is no stranger to controversy.
   Roshan Seth and Art Malik, known in the United States from their
performances in ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ``The Jewel In the
Crown,'' respectively, pulled out of the production due to what
theater publicists said were scheduling conflicts.
   But Ali said the actors had succumbed to pressure that appearing
in the play was ill-advised. Neither performer could be reached for
comment. The three roles are being played by Nabil Shaban, Paul
Bhattacharjee, and Fiona Victory.
   Ali said the title provoked ``a slight dispute with the theater
management,'' who requested that its original name, ``A Mullah's
Night Out,'' be changed so it did not give offense. A mullah is a
Moslem cleric.
   ``I thought it was a very funny title which puts us firmly
within the camp of a skeptical tradition of Islam itself which is
hostile to mullahs and the clergy,'' Ali said.
   But the Royal Court came under severe attack two years ago for
producing a play, Jim Allen's ``Perdition,'' which was accused of
being anti-Semitic, and it was clearly reluctant to enflame Moslem
opinion as it had earlier enflamed British Jews.
   London's Islamic community had no reaction to reports of the
play's debut.
   ``We don't know what it (`Iranian Nights') is all about; nothing
was sent to us,'' said Muhammed Ebrahim, executive secretary of the
Islamic Council. ``What we don't know, we cannot be concerned with.
   ``It's Ramadan, and during that month we're not interested in
any other activity,'' he added.

<HEAD>Mugabe Orders New Probe Into Official Corruption</HEAD>

   President Robert Mugabe ordered a new
judicial investigation into top-level corruption Thursday after a
judge linked five Cabinet ministers to a black-market racket on
cars and trucks.
   According to a report issued by Judge President Wilson Sandura
following a two-month inquiry of six Cabinet ministers, only
Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira was cleared of wrongdoing.
   Sandura's three-man commission recommends the five be prosecuted
for black marketeering. It identifies them as: Defense Minister
Enos Nkala; Political Affairs Minister Frederick Shava; Higher
Education Minister Dzingai Mutumbuka; Industry and Technology
Minister Callistus Ndlovu; and Maurice Nyagumbo, the most senior
minister accused and a staunch Mugabe ally.
   Nyagumbo resigned just hours before the 121-page report was
published. Nkala and Shava quit the government and sole legal
political party last month, after it was discovered they had lied
to the commission.
   The report also suggests Mutumbuka and Matabeleland North Gov.
Jacob Mudenda be prosecuted for perjury.
   Its publication of abuses of power and privileges in the
leadership has rocked this avowedly socialist government, but also
won Mugabe praise for ordering some of his closest aides to face
the embarrassment of being quizzed under the public spotlight.
   Mugabe is expected to announce major changes to his Cabinet
within the next few days, his aides said on condition of anonymity.
   Sandura investigated charges that Cabinet ministers and their
friends bought cars and trucks at Willowvale assembly plant at low,
fixed prices without having to wait. They then resold them on the
black market for up to five times what they paid.
   Ordinary Zimbabweans frequently wait up to 10 years to buy a car
because of a lack of hard currency.
   Mugabe on Thursday ordered Sandura to inquire into vehicle sales
to officials at Zimbabwe's two other assembly plants.
   Lines of people gathered early Thursday outside the government
printing offices seeking copies of Sandura's report, but they were
not available immediately.
   During the proceedings, spectators had crowded into the High
Court to jeer and boo many of the 60 witnesses, reflecting mounting
discontent with the people who have led the avowedly socialist
government for the nine years since independence from Britain.

   President Bush said today Americans should
try to correct the ills of the nation's schools by relying less on
the taxpayers' wallets and ``more on the collective will.''
   ``A nation that worships money _ or sees money as a cure for all
that ails it _ is a society in peril,'' Bush told an educational
conference here.
   ``More spending isn't the only right answer or even the best
answer,'' he said. ``What we need is better value for what we spend.
   ``What we need ... is a shared determination on the part of
every American to get involved with our schools,'' Bush added. ``We
must reestablish the value of teaching and learning in this
country.''
   After abruptly scrapping a vacation in Maine, Bush decided to go
ahead with a trip to Union High School here to drum up support for
a $441 million education package intended to reward good teachers
and schools.
   The program has been sharply criticized by Democrats as
inadequate.
   In his remarks, Bush called for ``partial deregulation of
education,'' saying: ``We want to waive some regulations for poorer
communities, allowing them to pool state and federal funds in
exchange for higher accountability and performance.''
   He did not elaborate, but Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos told
reporters on Air Force One en route here that the proposal was
designed to ``get funds to local schools without a lot of
paperwork.''
   Cavazos said the proposal was not contained in the president's
education package last week but would become part of the
administration's overall education program. ``There are so many
regulations and so much bureaucracy, we've got to clear some of
this away,'' he said.
   Bush spoke of the work of volunteers in schools and said, ``One
need matches another, and a wonderful thing happens. You come up
with an answer that money just can't buy.
   ``That's one reason we need to rely less on the collective
wallet and more on our collective will,'' the president said.
   Bush told the educators that children always have been taught
about the exploration of new frontiers, such as the first trips
across the ocean, the move West across America and journeys into
space.
   ``But we must now draw the attention of a new generation to a
larger, almost limitless horizon: the frontier of the mind,'' he
said.
   ``Our goal for education must be as ambitious as it's been for
the West or for space exploration or for any other American
frontier.''
   Thousands of flag-waving children lined the streets of this
residential community to cheer the president as his limousine
passed by.
   Bush stopped his motorcade briefly at Hamilton School to meet
Gina Marie Sisco, a sixth-grade pupil who had written him last week
to complain that she was not among those students who would get a
chance to meet him.
   In her letter, Gina said the students selected to see Bush were
chosen on the basis of winning the President's Academic Fitness
Award. ``I am proud of them but I feel it's unfair to show you just
the smart kids,'' she wrote.
   After greeting the girl, Bush shook hands for four minutes with
school children before traveling on to his speech.
   Today's stop in Union was supposed to have been the jumping-off
point for a three-day trip to Bush's seaside home in Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   However, the vacation segment was canceled Wednesday when Bush
decided to remain in Washington during a visit by his son Jeb and
his wife Columba, who are in town from Florida.
   ``Basically, they just didn't want to go,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``Presidents have the right to do
that.''
   Fitzwater said cancellation of the trip also meant Bush would be
on hand in case White House and congressional negotiators reached
agreement on a budget and deficit-reduction package.
   Bush's education proposal calls for cash rewards for successful
schools and good teachers, scholarship funds for students gifted in
science and math, financial grants to encourage magnet schools
offering specialized educational programs and special aid for urban
school districts with severe drug problems.
   It also would provide funds allowing states to set up programs
using teachers who lack standard education courses and other
certification requirements.
   Today's trip came on the heels of a speech and
question-and-answer session by Bush on Wednesday before the
convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, where he
outlined a series of steps to tighten ethical rules for Congress,
judges and the executive branch.
   Proposing a major change in the way congressional races are
financed, Bush called for a ban on campaign contributions by
political action committees. In last year's congressional races,
PACs spent more than $151 million directly on House and Senate
candidates. Democrats received the lion's share of that money, $99
million.
   Responding to questions on other issues, Bush said for the first
time the federal government may have been too slow in taking a
major role in cleaning up the Alaska oil spill.
   ``Maybe I should accept some criticism'' for not acting a week
sooner, said Bush, who last Friday put the government in virtual
control of the cleanup operation and authorized federal troops to
help out.
   On the other hand, he said the federal overnment ``moved much
more quickly and more boldly than it gets credit for.''
   Bush rejected suggestions that the spill should derail
administration hopes of oil and gas exploration in environmentally
sensitive areas.
   ``I simply do not want this disaster ... to weaken the national
security interest by making us further and further dependent on
foreign oil,'' he said. ``We're about up to 50 percent now and that
is not a good enough standard.''
   He was asked if he would give a full accounting of his role in
the Reagan administration's secret supply effort for the Nicaraguan
Contras, once the trial of former White House aide Oliver North is
concluded.
   ``I think I've given a full accounting,'' Bush responded.
Referring to stories coming out of the North trial, Bush said, ``I
don't like reading charges that I happen to feel are untrue but I
have to stand on that. And that just goes with the territory.''

   President Bush will reward the communist
government of Poland for newly instituted reform measures,
including its commitment to hold free elections for the first time
since 1946, an administration source said Thursday.
   Bush has chosen the Detroit Polish-American enclave of Hamtramck
as the setting to announce a series of measures aimed at
stimulating Poland's beleaguered economy, said the source, who
spoke on the grounds of anonymity.
   This official also indicated that consideration was still being
given to a Bush trip to the Eastern European nation, although no
general time frame has been established.
   Bush, as vice president, visited Poland during a nine-nation
European tour in September 1987, meeting with Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa and leaders of the communist government, just before
formally launching his campaign for the presidency.
   The Bush administration on April 5 hailed the agreement to
reinstate the Solidarity trade union movement as a legal force in
Polish society and its companion agreement to free elections in
June for a two-house parliament, in which some seats will be set
aside for Solidarity representatives.
   Walesa _ whose Solidarity organization helped force the
government to adopt sweeping, democratic reforms _ said Thursday
that his supporters want him to run for the newly created post of
president.
   In a telephone interview from his home in Gdansk, Walesa said he
would not run in June for a seat in the newly created Senate. But
he said he may not refuse if a member of the existing Sejm or the
new Senate nominates him when the two houses of parliament meet
later this year to elect a new president.
   If that doesn't happen, Walesa said, he will probably run in the
next presidential election scheduled six years from now.
   The White House hailed the April 5 accord as a ``historic step''
that would improve Polish-American relations.
   Speculation on new U.S. economic aid for Poland has centered on
granting the Warsaw government trade advantages under the General
System of Preferences (GSP) and steps to encourage private
investment in the Eastern European nation through the Overseas
Private Investment Corp.
   In 1981 and 1982, the U.S. government imposed economic sanctions
against Poland following the declaration of martial law and the
outlawing of the Solidarity trade union movement. Some sanctions
were lifted in 1987, after the Polish government moved toward a
reconciliation with the union. The United States, however, has
continued to pressure Western banks and governments against
extending credits to Warsaw.
   A Polish government spokesman said last week that it was asking
the United States to give the green light to loans from the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Western governments.
   ``What we want does not lie in the bilateral range of things,
not trade,'' said Polish Embassy spokesman Mierik Miernik.
   Poland's efforts to rebuild its shattered economy have been
hampered by an inflation rate running from 60 percent to 100
percent and by a $39 billion foreign debt. The Polish government
would like U.S. support in persuading bankers and governments to
reschedule repayment of the loans, Miernik said.

<TEXT>
   Abbie Hoffman, the 1960s radical who
inspired one generation and outraged another in the troubled days
of protest and Yippie pranks, has died at his home.
   He was 52.
   Hoffman, who was a defendant at the Chicago Seven antiwar
conspiracy trial and wrote books such as ``Revolution for the Hell
of It'' and ``Steal This Book,'' was found dead in his home
Wednesday evening, said Solebury Township Police Chief Richard
Mangan.
   He was fully dressed and under the covers of his bed.
   Michael Waldron, Hoffman's landlord and neighbor, found him and
told police Hoffman had been depressed about an auto accident in
which he suffered a broken leg last June.
   But Mangan said no evidence suggested suicide. An autopsy is
planned for this afternoon or tonight, the coroner's office said.
   Waldron said he went to the two-bedroom apartment after a friend
of Hoffman's, Joanna Lawrenson, asked him to check because she had
not been able to contact Hoffman by telephone.
   He said he looked trough a bedroom window and saw Hoffman in
bed, but he couldn't wake him by tapping on the window. ``I went
back to my house and got my key and opened the door and found him,
dead in bed, looking peaceful and comfortable,'' Waldron said.
   Hoffman's death shocked those who knew him.
   ``Oh, God. I'm stunned. He was brilliant,'' Dr. Timothy Leary
said. The LSD guru then added he needed time to collect his
thoughts before he could comment further.
   ``Abbie Hoffman was an American legend,'' Leary said later.
   Gerald B. Lefcourt, Hoffman's long-time attorney, remembered him
as a humorous man devoted to correcting what was wrong with society.
   ``He threw money on the (American) stock exchange floor in the
late '60s and was able to show in that satirical event, when
hundreds of people on the stock exchange on Wall Street chased
flying money on the floor, how silly it all was,'' Lefcourt said
from his New York City home.
   ``It's the end of an era,'' said Hoffman's 49-year-old brother,
Jack, from his Framingham, Mass., home.
   ``He was 52 years old and I think he gave up. ... Maybe he was
tired. I know he was disappointed in the young people of today. He
didn't feel he was getting through to them. He was disenchanted.''
   Just last week, Hoffman, who criticized college campuses in
recent years as ``bastions of rest,'' told a Vanderbilt University
audience that he was saddened by the interest today's young people
have in the 1960s.
   ``Nostalgia is a sign of middle-age,'' he told them during an
appearance with Leary. ``We're reminiscing about our youth. When
you see young people nostalgic for a youth they didn't even
experience, it's a little sad. They're supposed to be out making
one for themselves.''
   Hoffman was writing a book when he died, said his publisher,
John Oakes.
   ``He was somebody who stayed true to what he believed in unlike
so many of his contemporaries who sold out and became just what
they detested when they were 20 years old,'' said Oakes.
   A native of Worcester, Mass., Hoffman rose to prominence with
the Chicago Seven, a group of radicals who stood trial on charges
of conspiring to disrupt the bloody 1968 Democratic National
Convention in Chicago.
   The others were Tom Hayden, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger,
Reynard C. Davis, Lee Weiner and John Froines.
   The 4{-month-long federal trial's theatrics featured wild-haired
defendants and a 74-year-old judge, Julius Hoffman, who ordered
Bobby Seale, a former Black Panther leader, bound and gagged in the
courtroom. Seale's trial later was severed from the others.
   Hoffman and four others also were charged with crossing state
lines with intent to riot. They were acquitted of conspiracy but
convicted of the second charge. The convictions eventually were
overturned.
   During a reunion of the Chicago Seven last year, Hoffman
characterized himself as ``an American dissident.''
   ``I don't think my goals have changed since I was 4 and I fought
schoolyard bullies,'' said Hoffman.
   Two years ago, he was arrested for the 42nd time while
protesting CIA recruitment at the University of Massachusetts.
Hoffman, Amy Carter, daughter of former President Carter, and 13
others eventually were acquitted of trespassing and disorderly
conduct.
   Hoffman, whose given name was Abbott, was born Nov. 30, 1936.
   His activist roots can be traced to Worcester, where in the
early '60s he was a chairman of the Friends of the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and vice chairman of the Congress
of Racial Equality.
   He started the loosely organized Yippie movement, or Youth
International Party, in 1968 to bring together radicals to protest
the government and the Vietnam War.
   Hoffman went underground in 1974 to avoid trial on cocaine
possession charges. He emerged nearly seven years later and
revealed he had lived in upstate New York and had undergone plastic
surgery.
   He moved to this Philadelphia suburb several years ago during
the height of a losing battle furor via the airwaves and the host of the
conference here.
   ``A good many people who listen to talk radio feel frustrated
that they never knew what to do'' in responding to issues, Williams
said in a recent interview. ``We just lead them down the path,
(telling them) here are the principles.''
   Beginning June 9, Williams will have most of the visiting talk
show hosts on his afternoon program. Among those expected to attend
are Michael Siegel of KING in Seattle, Roy Fox of KFYI in Phoenix,
Tom Leykis of KFI in Los Angeles, Al Rantel of WNWS in Miami, and
former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, now a talk show host on WCAU
in Philadelphia.
   Radio hosts have long used the airwaves to stir up interest in
local issues, but last February they took the technique nationwide.
   Led by talk show hosts, listeners flooded Congress with a
torrent of tea bags bearing the message ``Read my tea bag: no 50
percent raise.'' The public pressure helped quash a salary hike for
congressmen, judges and others on the federal payroll.
   Now, Siegel, in Seattle, is trying to generate national interest
in a campaign to boycott Exxon to protest its response to the Exxon
Valdez oil spill. He has been interviewed on other radio stations
around the country and says he is receiving 200 letters a day, many
containing demolished Exxon credit cards.
   The entertainment media has gone far in the past year with the
radio talk show host. The 1988 film ``Talk Radio'' depicted a
badgering Texas talk show host and the televsion series ``Midnight
Caller'' features on an ex-cop who uses the airwaves to fight crime.
   The talk show hosts have loosely formed a federation but, as
yet, it has no name. Williams is considering ``Vox Pop,'' short for
the Latin phrase vox populi, or voice of the people.
   Williams and other radio hosts say they are lobbyists for their
listeners.
   But others see them as demagogues who gloss over the
complexities of issues and sell a largely conservative brand of
conventional wisdom to their audiences.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., a supporter of the pay-raise bill,
spoke out against the radio-driven pressure against the measure.
``We became cartoon cannon fodder for trash televison and for talk
radio,'' Fazio said from the House floor. ``We fell prey to the
deception of the rabble rousers.''
   ``I'm a little bit concerned that the local disc jockeys and
talk show hosts are using serious national issues for
audience-building,'' said James H. Quello, a member of the Federal
Communications Commission. ``Some of them remind me of college
sophomores at a rally.''
   For sophomores, the radio hosts make good money. A host in a
major market can easily make more than $100,000 a year and
sometimes much more, according to Phoenix radio host Barry Young.
   And they can be worth that to their stations. In a random
sampling, talk shows on three AM stations rated by The Arbitron Co.
all increased their market share by last fall compared to the
previous year. In less than a year in 1988 the Jerry Williams Show
went from a 7.9 percent share to a 9.3 percent share.
   Murry Levin, a political science professor at Boston University
and author of ``Talk Radio and the American Dream,'' listened to
700 hours of local talk radio programing and is convinced of its
power.
   Talk radio, he said, ``is the only medium that provides an
outlet for working-class people.''
   Siegel, despite his success in getting support on the oil spill
issue, says the audience, not the host, sets the agenda. ``We don't
have control over these people.''

<HEAD>Sluggish Sales Seen as Sign of Economic Slowdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Retail sales edged up a meager 0.1 percent
last month after dropping sharply in February, the government said
Thursday in a report analysts cited as evidence that cautious
consumer spending is moderating economic growth.
   Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $139.42 billion last month,
held back by sluggish business at department stores and auto
dealerships, the Commerce Department reported. Sales had plunged
0.6 percent in February.
   The weak figures for the past two months are consistent with a
series of recent government reports that suggest slower economic
growth lies ahead as the record peacetime expansion stretches into
its seventh year.
   ``I don't think we are going to see a big slowdown or a caving
in, but there is definitely a softer tone to growth and it is being
driven by softer consumer spending,'' said economist Allen Sinai of
the Boston Co.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the retail
sales figures ``provide further evidence of a pattern of slower
consumer spending in recent months. We continue to believe the
economy is sound, showing steady growth with low inflation.''
   For the third straight month, overall sales in March were held
down by a decline in spending on autos, which account for almost
one-fourth of the retail total.
   Automotive sales edged down 0.1 percent in March after declining
2.5 percent in February and 1.9 percent in January. It was the
first time auto sales have dropped for three straight months in
nearly five years.
   Carmakers in recent weeks have launched a new round of incentive
programs in hopes of luring customers back to showrooms during the
prime spring selling season despite higher interest rates for loans.
   Excluding the automotive category, retail sales last month still
were up just 0.2 percent for March after holding virtually even
during February.
   Retail sales account for about one-third of overall economic
activity and are closely watched as a measure of the economy's
health.
   Analysts said the weakness in retail spending has occurred even
though consumer confidence remains high and income growth has been
strong, and appears to reflect the effects of higher interest
rates, rising inflation and a tapering off of demand after years of
heavy spending.
   ``People are probably just taking a deep breath and stepping
back a bit,'' said economist Lea Tyler of the WEFA Group in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa. ``I would interpret it as a bit of belt-tightening on
the part of the consumers.''
   Many analysts expect the economy to lose steam this year in
response to a campaign by the Federal Reserve Board to push up
interest rates and thus dampen demand and restrain inflation. Some
economists have expressed concern that the Fed's campaign could
unintentionally tip the country into a recession.
   Ms. Tyler said that based on recent reports showing weakness in
consumer spending and other sectors of the economy, ``the risk of a
recession arriving some time in the latter half of this year or
early next year has risen.''
   However, she said the economy is more likely to experience
slower growth and ``skirt a recession without actually dipping into
one.''
   In the key category of department and other general merchandise
stores, sales fell 1.2 percent in March to $15.6 billion after
declining 1.5 percent in February.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, were down 0.2 percent last month after
plunging 1.7 percent in February. Sales of non-durable goods,
meanwhile, rose 0.3 percent in March after climbing 0.2 percent
during the previous month.
   Among the categories of goods to report sales increases last
month were: food and grocery stores, up 0.2 percent; gasoline
service stations, up 0.5 percent; and bars and restaurants, up 0.5
percent.
   Categories posting declines included building and hardware
stores, down 1.9 percent; furniture stores, down 0.2 percent;
clothing and accessory stores, down 0.4 percent; and drug stores,
down 0.2 percent.

   The co-developer of a University of Utah cold
fusion experiment submitted to intense scrutiny by his peers, and
concluded he was certain it was a way to tap the energy of the
stars.
   Chemist B. Stanley Pons told 7,000 people attending a meeting of
the American Chemical Society on Wednesday that an experiment
conducted at room temperature produced energy from nuclear fusion,
but that exactly how it works on a molecular level is still not
clear.
   ``It's absolutely sure in my mind that what we've seen (is
nuclear fusion),'' said Pons. ``We cannot explain the data in any
other way.''
   Pons received long-distance support just as the discussions
began. Scientists in the Soviet Union announced they had duplicated
the Utah experiment and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
said it had applied for patents involving cold nuclear fusion.
Today, two graduate students at the University of Washington said
they also had partially duplicated the Utah work.
   But a physicist and other experts who sat beside Pons during a
panel discussion said they remained unconvinced that the Utah
experiment was fusion.
   Harold P. Furth, director of the Princeton University Plasma
Physics Laboratory, said with barely contained contempt that
world-class physicists will not take the Utah findings seriously
until the precise process involved is explained and demonstrated
with control experiments.
   Furth said that some experts believe the energy detected in the
Utah experiment is actually a chemical reaction that is not
understood.
   Another panel member, University of Texas chemist Allen J. Bard,
said he had an open mind on the experiment, but added: ``It is
unprecedented to see chemical reactions produce nuclear reactions.
The verdict is still out.''
   Two weeks ago, Pons and co-investigator Martin Fleischmann of
the University of Southampton in Britain announced they had
achieved fusion using ordinary laboratory equipment at room
temperature.
   The announcement stunned and confused researchers around the
world, some of whom have spent more than 25 years and millions of
dollars trying to develop controlled nuclear fusion.
   Pons and Fleischmann said their experiment used a rod of
palladium and a coil of platinum immersed in a beaker of ``heavy
water,'' in which ordinary hydrogen atoms are replaced by
deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. When electricity was
applied to the coil for about 100 hours, it forced deuterium atoms
into the palladium until the atoms fused, producing energy in the
form of heat, Pons said.
   He said the device made four watts of energy for every watt used.
   Pons said he is enlarging the experiment and if the process
still works, then cold fusion may provide a dramatic new energy
source.
   Pons admitted he was not sure how the experiment causes fusion
and exactly what role each of the chemicals play in producing
energy.
   Furth said physicists will not take the work seriously until a
control experiment is conducted using ordinary water instead of
deuterium oxide, also called ``heavy water.''
   Pons announced earlier that he conducted such an experiment with
ordinary water, and it did not produce the radiation or energy
effects.
   In Italy, meanwhile, Fleischmann presented more details of the
experiment at an international conference in Erice, Sicily, but
many scientists there said they were skeptical.
   ``I'm warning people _ don't sell your oil well yet,'' said
physicist Steven Jones of Brigham Young University in Utah.
   Fusion, the energy process that fuels the sun, the stars and the
hydrogen bomb, holds promise of becoming the ultimate energy source.
   The fusion of atoms in only 1-250th of an ounce of deuterium
would give an energy equivalent of 300 gallons of gasoline, and
deuterium can be extracted from the oceans for only pennies per
gallon of seawater.
   Furthermore, fusion fires burn without the pollution produced
from fossil fuels, and fusion creates hundreds of times less
radioactive waste than do atom-splitting nuclear power plants.
   Elsewhere, the Soviet news agency Tass reported that Soviet
scientists duplicated the Utah experiment and reported achieving
nuclear fusion at room temperature. The Soviet scientists planned
more research on cold fusion, Tass said.
   MIT said it has applied for patents involving cold nuclear
fusion based on the theoretical work of Peter L. Hagelstein, a
university researcher who a decade ago pioneered what eventually
became the world's first X-ray laser.
   MIT today refused to disclose any details of Hagelstein's theory
or the technology he devised. Hagelstein's process is yet to be
tested in a laboratory, said MIT spokesman Eugene Mallove.
   The disclosure comes less than a week after other MIT scientists
said they were unable to duplicate the Utah experiment and raised
doubts about the Utah claims. Mallove said today those other MIT
experiments, independent of Hagelstein's work, were continuing.
   Today, two University of Washington researchers said they
detected indications of cold fusion in an experiment they conducted
with heavy water, and did not get the same results using a control
experiment with ordinary water.
   They said that in their experiment, a mass spectrometer detected
a possible indicator of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen
commonly produced in fusion reactions.
   Earlier this week, scientists from Texas A&amp;M and Georgia Tech
announced that they had achieved a reaction using equipment modeled
on the Utah experiment.

   Two University of Washington researchers detected
indications of cold fusion in an experiment they conducted with
heavy water, but could not get the same results using a control
experiment with ordinary water, the researchers said today.
   Graduate students Van L. Eden and Wei Liu said they did not
duplicate exactly a highly publicized experiment by University of
Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann of the
University of Southampton, England. Pons and Fleischmann said they
apparently produced nuclear fusion in a tabletop experiment using
ordinary lab equipment.
   But Eden and Liu said they did get indications that fusion may
have taken place in their experiment last week.
   Eden said that in their experiement, a mass spectrometer
detected a possible indicator of tritium, a radioactive isotope of
hydrogen commonly produced in fusion reactions.
   The indicator was found when the experiment was run using
deuterium, a hydrogen isotope found in seawater and known as
``heavy water.'' Eden said the indicator was not detected when the
test was repeated with ordinary water.
   Both researchers, who specialize in molecular studies, cautioned
the results were preliminary and needed review by other scientists.
They also said they had not ruled out any other explanations for
what they observed.
   They said scientists expect a fusion reaction to produce
substantial quantities of neutrons, but they did not detect any,
although they were not using a particularly sensitive detector for
them.
   The pair used a test tube containing deuterium oxide in which a
palladium electrode and gold wire were placed and connected to a
power source. The palladium electrode, actually a hollow rod with
one end sealed, was connected to a vacuum chamber, which in turn
was connected to the mass spectrometer, which detects indications
of nuclear particles.
   Two weeks ago, Pons and Fleischmann announced they had achieved
fusion at room temperature using ordinary laboratory equipment.
   The announcement stunned and confused researchers around the
world, some of whom have spent more than 25 years and millions of
dollars trying to develop controlled nuclear fusion.
   Pons and Fleischmann said their experiment used a rod of
palladium and a coil of platinum immersed in a beaker of ``heavy
water'' _ water made with deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. When
electricity was applied to the coil for about 100 hours, it forced
deuterium atoms into the palladium until the atoms fused, producing
energy in the form of heat, Pons said.
   Harold Furth, director of plasma physics at Princeton
University, appeared with Pons on Wednesday at a meeting of the
American Chemical Society in Dallas.
   Furth said top physicists will not take the Utah findings
seriously until the precise process involved is explained and
demonstrated with control experiments, and some experts believe the
energy detected in the Utah experiment is actually a chemical
reaction that is not understood.
   But Furth said that if the experiment worked using heavy water
but not ordinary water, it would suggest the reaction actually did
involve some sort of deuterium fusion.
   Pons admitted he was not sure how the experiment causes fusion
and exactly what role each of the chemicals play in producing
energy.
   Fusion, the energy process that powers the sun, the stars and
the hydrogen bomb, holds promise of becoming the ultimate energy
source.
   The fusion of atoms in only 1-250th of an ounce of deuterium
would give an energy equivalent of 300 gallons of gasoline, and
deuterium can be extracted from the oceans for only pennies per
gallon of seawater.

   Edith Eger relied on humor to survive
Auschwitz. Mineko Lewis used physical activity to make it through
U.S. internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Porter
Halyburton helped Fred Cherry survive in a tiny cell of a North
Vietnamese prison.
   The four spoke Wednesday at a conference on the trauma suffered
by captives of all kinds. Organizers said they hoped to heighten
awareness among academics and care-givers of the lingering
psychological effects.
   Ms. Lewis, 61, who teaches English at the University of
Tennessee, told nearly 200 people during a panel discussion she
can't watch documentaries with film footage of elderly Japanese
being interned on the West Coast during the war.
   ``The old people just gave up. Afterward, they didn't know what
to do. They died physically and spiritually,'' said Ms. Lewis, a
teen-ager at the time who had never before spoken publicly about
her experience in an internment camp.
   Ms. Eger, 61, a San Diego psychotherapist, said she and other
Holocaust survivors weren't equipped to handle freedom.
   ``When we were finally liberated the gate was opened and we
didn't know what to do,'' she said. ``We craved freedom, but we
didn't know how to take responsibility for our lives.''
   Ms. Eger was 16 when she was sent to Auschwitz. Her recovery was
slow. ``It took me 30 years just to even utter and speak the
unspeakable,'' Ms. Eger said.
   Ms. Eger recalled how, as a ballet student, she danced for
Joseph Mengele, nicknamed the ``Angel of Death,'' and how she joked
with one of her captors when he regularly drew her blood for
transfusions.
   ``I bet him my blood you're never going to win the war,'' said
Ms. Eger, a native of Hungary. ``That's where humor came in. Humor
was the best tranquilizer.''
   Cherry, 61, and Halyburton were fighter pilots who were shot
down. Halyburton was in the Navy, Cherry the Air Force. Cherry, a
poor, rural black from Suffolk, Va., and Halyburton, a middle-class
white from Davidson, N.C., were thrust together with their captors'
hope that their backgrounds would create racial friction.
   The strategy backfired and the two quickly became lifelong
friends.
   ``I first perceived him as a plant for intelligence-gathering
purposes,'' Cherry said. ``I thought he was a trained spy. We
played cat and mouse for a very short while.''
   The night Halyburton was thrown into his cell, Cherry was
suffering a dislocated shoulder and a broken foot, along with the
starvation and depression both suffered.
   The North Vietnamese eventually performed surgery on his
shoulder, but he was worse off with infection afterward.
   ``I was very ill. I was literally rotting under the cast. Haly
was stuck with me,'' said Cherry, now a computer marketing
executive in Silver Spring, Md. ``He hd to do everything for me. He
offered me his food, hand-fed me, bathed me.''
   Halyburton, now 48 and a professor at the Naval War Academy in
Newport, R.I., was far from the racist his captors thought he would
be.
   ``All they knew was I was a Southerner. It didn't take us long
to realize who we were,'' he said of his friend. ``I don't think
I'd ever been happier to see anybody in my life.''

<HEAD>FDA Says Peroxide Used As AIDS Treatment Causes Texas Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful concentration of hydrogen peroxide
being promoted as a treatment for AIDS and cancer has caused the
death of a Texas child who mistook the chemical for water, the Food
and Drug Administration said Thursday.
   The FDA said the death occurred in Conroe, Texas last September
when a mother took what she thought was a bottle of water from her
refrigerator and poured drinks for her two children and the child
of a neighbor.
   The neighbor's child died, and the two others were severely
injured.
   The FDA announcement also said that two brothers in Dennison,
Texas were hospitalized after a similar incident. The FDA did not
reveal the names of those injured or killed.
   A product sold as ``35 percent Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide'' to
be used in what is called ``Hyper-oxygenation Therapy'' for AIDS,
cancer and more than 60 other conditions was blamed for the death
and injuries, the FDA said.
   The agency said the peroxide solution is highly corrosive and is
considered dangerous. The peroxide concentration is about 10 times
stronger than the 3 percent solution commonly used to disinfect
minor cuts.
   ``This concentration is not approved by the FDA for any
therapeutic purpose,'' said FDA commissioner Frank E. Young. ``No
one has come forward with any evidence this substance taken
internally has any medical value. Buyers are being cheated and
subjected to significant risks and family members are being
injured.''
   The FDA said the concentrated hydrogen peroxide is purchased
from chemical plants in Texas and Mexico, repackaged in smaller
containers and then sold under such labels as ``Biowater'' and
``H202.''
   Literature accompanying the product explains how to dilute the
peroxide and claims that it can be used for sprouting seeds,
purifying meat, and for treatment of acne, gum disease, athlete's
foot, colic, headache, varicose veins, acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and cancer.
   Use of the product is promoted as an ``alternative medicine'' by
mail-order distributors in Texas, Wisconsin, Minnesota and
California, and by some health food outlets, the FDA said. It is
sold in pint, quart and gallon containers, some with
child-resistant caps.
   The FDA said material distributed with the peroxide includes
fictitious medical claims and claims that the benefits of the
chemical are being suppressed by the government and the medical
establishment.
   Federal officials have attempted to block promotion of the
chemical as a home remedy since 1985, but it has continued, the FDA
announcement said.

   Actress Audrey Hepburn, in her real-life
role as UNICEF's goodwill ambassador, Thursday saw off a ramshackle
tugboat on its mission to save starving people in southern Sudan.
   Before the tug, flying blue flags of the United Nations, left
this suburb south of Khartoum, Miss Hepburn was briefed on the
mechanics of Operation Lifeline Sudan, a massive relief effort
aiming to prevent 100,000 or more starvation deaths this summer.
   The U.N.-organized project, which began April 1 but has done
little so far because of logistical problems, is to prestock more
than 170,000 tons of supplies in southern Sudan before rains in
mid-May make most of the region's roads impassable.
   Aid experts doubt the $132 million program's chances for success
because of the difficulties of transporting food amid Sudan's
6-year-old civil war.
   The brief departure ceremony was Miss Hepburn's first official
act in Sudan as ambassador of the U.N. children's fund, a post she
took last year to succeed the late actor Danny Kaye.
   Wearing white pants, pink T-shirt and white sweater, Miss
Hepburn, 59, waved from the tug to young Sudanese sitting on the
White Nile riverbank and posed for pictures with members of the
boat's Sudanese and Bangladeshi crew.

   An attorney for the rock band Judas Priest is
seeking dismissal of a lawsuit that claims the British group's
heavy metal music led two youths into a suicide pact.
   Suellen Fulstone of Reno said in a motion filed Wednesday that
the band could be held liable in the case only if the courts
created a dangerous exception to First Amendment rights for
subliminal messages.
   ``The implications of any such exception are altogether
frigid,'' she said. ``The very fact of this lawsuit has had an
improperly inhibiting effect on creative work. It should be the
last of its kind.''
   Ms. Fulstone argued in the Washoe District Court motion that
words that are heard subconsciously should have the same
constitutional protection as any other printed or spoken words.
   A lawsuit against Judas Priest and CBS Records claims that the
words and subliminal messages on the band's ``Stained Class'' album
motivated James Vance and Raymond Belknap of Sparks to attempt
suicide in 1985. Belknap shot himself to death, but when Vance
fired, the shotgun slipped and ripped his face apart. He died in
November.

   ``The best thing that happens is when a veteran says to me,
`Thanks for helping me get through Nam,''' said Cronauer, who was
on the air from Saigon in 1965-66, entertaining the troops with
music and irreverent humor.
   Cronauer's speech Wednesday at South Suburban College in South
Holland was peppered with anecdotes about his radio show and his
dealings with Hollywood, but he concluded on a more somber note.
   ``Vietnam veterans often greet each other by saying `Welcome
home,' because no one else ever said that to us,'' he said.
   Later, at lunch, a vet in a black ``POW-MIA'' T-shirt approached
Cronauer, shook his hand and said quietly, ``Welcome home.''

   It's been a good year for Max von
Sydow, who starred in an Oscar-winning picture, directed his first
film and now has been paid a $50,000 tax settlement that ends a
16-year dispute.
   The national news agency TT said Thursday the government paid
von Sydow the money in compensation and court costs as a result of
his challenge of a fine for allegedly underpaying his 1973 tax bill.
   Because he could find no mechanism to appeal in Sweden, von
Sydow had paid the fine and left the country in a huff. He took
Sweden to the European Court of Human Rights, saying the lack of an
appeal mechanism infringed on his rights. The case was settled out
of court in 1987.
   Von Sydow, 59, was nominated for best actor in ``Pelle the
Conqueror,'' which won the Oscar for best foreign film last month.
``Along the Roadside,'' the Danish-language film he directed, has

   A car bomb exploded near a shopping
arcade in a northeastern town Thursday, killing at least 38 people.
The military blamed Tamil extremists for the blast that broke a
truce.
   Angry Sinhalese in the port of Trincomalee retaliated by
stabbing a Tamil to death and wounding seven others, residents
said. The mob also set ablaze a shop owned by a Tamil.
   A spokesman for the most militant Tamil rebel group, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, denied it planted the bomb.
   Twenty-four of the men and women who died in the blast were
Sinhalese, a military official said. The other victims were Tamils
and Moslems, said the official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   The booby-trapped car was parked outside a hotel and shopping
arcade. It detonated as more than 100 Sinhalese hunted for gifts
and sweets to celebrate their New Year on Thursday, said a
spokeswoman for the Indian High Commission (embassy).
   The blast destroyed the hotel and flattened four neighboring
shops in Trincomalee, which is 147 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Indian peacekeeping troops imposed an unofficial curfew and were
patrolling the town, the Indian spokeswoman said.
   India deployed troops here in 1987 to disarm Tamil militants
under a peace accord to end the six-year Tamil separatist campaign
that has claimed 12,500 lives.
   New Delhi became involved because its own 60 million Tamils
sympathize with the rebel cause. Tamils in Sri Lanka claim the
majority Sinhalese discriminate against them in jobs and education.
   Left-wing Sinhalese extremists have reacted violently to the
peace accord, saying it makes too many concessions by allowing
limited autonomy for the Tamil minority.
   Tamil rebels also reject the accord, saying it does not meet
their demands for self-rule.
   The latest violence came on the second day of a weeklong
cease-fire offered by President Ranasinghe Premadasa to Tamil and
Sinhalese extremists. The peace package included a general amnesty,
seats in parliament and jobs for militants.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of the island's 16 million people.
Sinhalese are 75 percent of the population and control the
government and military.

to disperse hundreds of fans who tried to mob rock singer Rod
Stewart at a concert, and more than 150 people were injured, police
said Thursday.
   None of those injured Wednesday was hurt seriously enough to be

   More than 1,600 fans tried to mob Stewart as he entered the
concert hall, prompting the action by the guards.
   Halfway into the concert, blown fuses plunged the hall into

   Oliver North wrapped up six tough days on the
witness stand today with a final declaration of his innocence of
charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair.
   The former White House aide said he felt he was tabbed by Reagan
administration officials to be the fall guy in the affair when he
heard himself described at a White House news conference in
November 1986 as ``the only one who knew what was going on.''
   He also said he told the truth to then-Attorney General Edwin
Meese III, who had been assigned by President Reagan to conduct an
inquiry into the sale of arms to Iran. Meese's aides uncovered the
diversion of proceeds to the Contra during the inquiry.
   North's defense case was concluded shortly after he left the
witness stand. U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said he hoped
final arguments would begin on Monday.
   North was questioned closely during the day over details of the
government's charges against him.
   He testified that he used catalog store typewriters to write
back-dated letters claiming that he had offered to pay for a
$13,800 home security system that he had actually had accepted free
of charge.
   On his sixth and final day of testimony at his trial, North said
he typed the letters in December 1986 after he had been fired from
the National Security Council staff because of the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Still in the Marine Corps after being dismissed from the NSC,
North said he didn't want to type the backdated letters at work
because he didn't want the Marines involved in ``that type of
coverup.''
   Now accused of accepting an illegal gratuity, North said he went
to a catalog outlet on two occasions, using typewriters there to
create two backdated letters. The documents were a phony offer to
pay by saying the system was on loan until North left the
government and that the installer could use his home as a promotion
for his business.
   North had accepted the security system in mid-1986 from retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who North had enlisted to
secretly run arms to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   North also testified that he assumed a coverup was in place when
Meese announced on Nov. 25, 1986 that North was the pivotal figure
in diverting money to the Contras.
   Ending four days of grueling cross-examination, North said Meese
gave reporters details of the arms shipments and diversion that
were ``inconsistent with what I had told the attorney general two
days before.''
   At the news conference, Meese said North's boss, then-national
security adviser John Poindexter, had known of the diversion but
hadn't approved it.
   In fact, Poindexter has said he approved the diversion.
   ``This was part of pointing the finger at Ollie North'' as a
coverup and that ``is the way it was supposed to be,'' the former
NSC aide testified. President Reagan announced North's firing from
the White House staff at the news conference.
   North denied that he lied to Meese's aides as the Iran-Contra
affair was unfolding, saying that ``by golly, when they raised''
the diversion of money to the Nicaraguan rebels ``I told them about
it.''
   North said he was unable to recall many details of the Nov. 23,
1986 interview, which is memorialized only in handwritten notes
taken by a Justice Department lawyer.
   ``This was a four-hour meeting with 29 pages of very cryptic
notes,'' said North, who is accused of obstructing the inquiry by
Meese and making false statements.
   North is charged with lying by allegedly omitting any mention of
Secord's role in the diversion of the Iranian arms sales proceeds
to the Contras at a time when Congress banned aid to the rebels.
   Meese and his aides said North told them that the National
Security Council had no involvement in the diversion and that
Israel determined how much would be diverted.
   In the interview with Meese, North also said he told Contra
leader Adolfo Calero to open bank accounts in Switzerland to
receive the money from Israel, according to the indictment.
   North from the witness stand gave a different account of what
transpired in the Sunday afternoon meeting in Meese's office. He
said he told the attorney general that Israel subtracted
operational costs in the Iran weapons operation, thus determining
how much was left over and available for the Contras and other
projects.
   North said he told Meese the NSC was not involved in moving the
diversion money through various accounts. He said he also told the
attorney general that Swiss bank accounts to receive the diversion
money had been set up by Secord.
   The diversion of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Contras
was ``a secret within a secret'' and North did not bring it up
until Meese handed him a memo outlining it, he said.
   ``By golly when they raised it, I told them about it,'' North
testified.

<TEXT>
   Police raided a farmhouse equipped with
torture chambers, tunnels to hide kidnap victims and a shooting
range, and they said the complex was used by a paramilitary group
linked to the Medellin drug cartel.
   In the raid Wednesday, police said they arrested 10 gunmen and
freed two kidnap victims from the center in a country home near
Envigado, 10 miles from Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city.
   Members of the paramilitary group were warned of the raid by a
sophisticated alarm system, and at least 10 escaped, said Col.
Antonio Sanchez Vargas, the police chief of Medellin.
   Police found powerful communications equipment, weapons and cars
at the site, he said.
   Martin Alonso Alvarez, one of two people released from the
tunnels, said he was kidnapped Wednesday and beaten by gunmen who
asked him if he belonged to the Cali drug cartel.
   The Cali cartel is Colombia's second-largest drug trafficking
ring and is battling the Medellin group for control of the
billion-dollar New York drug market. Medellin reportedly is the
world's largest drug ring and controls about 80 percent of U.S.
drug markets.
   More than 120 people have died in the 15-month battle between
the cartels, and there have been more than 30 dynamite and firebomb
attacks against property owned by leaders of the rings, army
officials said.
   Between them, the cartels control 13 private armies and about
2,000 men, said Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, the head of the secret
police, in a report to President Virgilio Barco.
   Maza Marquez said at least one of the paramilitary groups was
trained in Puerto Boyaca, 70 miles northeast of Bogota, by British
and Israeli experts. He did not elaborate.
   Drug trafficking rings trained the paramilitary groups to
protect themselves and kill those who interfere with their drug
business, according to Maza Marquez.
   Last week, another training center also linked to the Medellin
cartel was discovered on a farm near Puerto Lopez, 90 miles east of
Bogota.
   On the grounds, police found secret tunnels, training centers
for hired gunmen and the graves of five people.

   State troopers pulled over a motorist,
charged him with drunken driving, then filed the same charge
against his friend and then his sister when they came to the police
station to pick him up.
   ``It's strange but it happens,'' state police Trooper Edward
Meyers said Thursday.
   Steven Finning, 22, of Danbury, Conn., was pulled over early
Monday for speeding and driving erratically on Interstate 84. He
was charged with driving while intoxicated.
   A friend of Finning's, Robert Fuda, 21, was driving behind him
and saw the arrest. He followed the patrol car to the state police
barracks, according to Finning's sister, Eve.
   After troopers talked with Fuda, he too was charged with driving
while intoxicated. Both men refused to take breath tests, Meyers
said.
   The men then called Eve Finning. When she arrived, troopers
began questioning her.
   ``They said my eyes looked glossy,'' Miss Finning said. ``I
mean, it was 4 a.m. They charged me, too, and I definitely was not
drunk.''
   She agreed to take the sobriety test, failed it and also was
charged with drunken driving, Meyers said.
   Anyone driving with a blood-alcohol level above 0.10 percent in
New York state is considered legally drunk. Meyers said he could
not say what Miss Finning's blood alcohol level was.
   All three were arraigned and released on $100 bail.
   Miss Finning said they called another friend to come pick them
up. That friend was not arrested.

   The AIDS crisis is still growing but slowing,
federal AIDS officials said Thursday, adding that the focus of the
disease in the United States is shifting away from the crowded
Northeast.
   In a report on the eight years since AIDS was first reported,
the national Centers for Disease Control said the rate of increase
in the number of documented AIDS cases ``has steadily declined,''
for the most part.
   In the CDC's latest monthly count, the nation has reported
90,990 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome; 52,435 of
those patients, or 58 percent, have died.
   The number of AIDS cases, as compared to the year before, shot
up 215 percent from 1982 to 1983. Since then, the increase has
slowed, for the most part: up 117 percent in 1984, 84 percent in
1985, 60 percent in 1986, 60 percent again in 1987 and 34 percent
last year, when 32,311 cases were reported, said Dr. Jeannette
Stehr-Green, chief of the CDC's AIDS reporting and analysis section.
   The 60 percent increase for 1987, which remained unchanged from
the year before, came at a time when the medical definition of AIDS
was changed, resulting in more cases being reported.
   ``The numbers are still increasing, but they're not increasing
as rapidly,'' Stehr-Green said. ``It's important for people to
realize the number of cases is still increasing and ... the
increases in certain populations are still very significant.''
   Blacks and Hispanics, the CDC noted, ``continue to be
disproportionately represented among AIDS patients.''
   Blacks make up 27 percent of all reported cases; Hispanics
account for 15 percent. The U.S. population is about 12 percent
black and about 6 percent Hispanic.
   While the overall increase in AIDS has slowed, the geographic
focus of the disease has moved; only 32 percent of the nation's
AIDS cases in 1988 were reported from New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania, compared to 54 percent four years earlier.
   ``It's moving outside of the major metropolitan areas, and
outside the Northeast,'' Stehr-Green said, noting that the
proportion of cases in urban areas under 500,000 population
increased from 12 percent in pre-1986 years to 19 percent in 1988.
   Still, ``AIDS incidence is highest in the most populous
metropolitan ares in the United States,'' the CDC said in its
weekly report. Metro areas with more than a million people comprise
41 percent of the nation's population, but account for 75 percent
of its AIDS cases. The New York City area has reported the largest
number of AIDS cases, 18,860.
   As has been the case since the epidemic's earliest days, most
AIDS patients are male _ 91 percent of the adult or adolescent
cases reported. And the vast majority of all patients still are
homosexual or bisexual males, 60 percent; intravenous drug abusers,
20 percent; or both, 7 percent.

<HEAD>2 Found Guilty in Pentagon Corruption Investigation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former executives of a California
defense contractor were convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud
Thursday in the first trial arising from the Pentagon corruption
scandal.
   A federal court jury deliberated nearly 36 hours over four days
before returning guilty verdicts against George Kaub and Eugene
Sullivan, former vice presidents of Teledyne Electronics of Newbury
Park, Calif.
   Each was convicted on one count of conspiracy. Kaub was found
guilty on five counts of wire fraud and two counts of filing false
statements. Sullivan was convicted on three counts of wire fraud.
   A third defendant, Dale Schnittjer, was acquitted on conspiracy
and wire fraud charges by U.S. District Judge Richard Williams
after the jury failed to reach a verdict against him. Schnittjer is
also a former vice president of Teledyne Electronics.
   All the defendants were found innocent of bribery, a charge
stemming from the government's contention that the former
executives knew money was paid to a Navy engineer for inside
information about a $24 million contract for hand-held radar test
equipment.
   Kaub, who faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in jail and a
fine of $2 million, hung his head and stared at the defense table
after the bailiff read the verdict.
   Sullivan could be sentenced to 20 years in jail and fined a
maximum of $1 million. He appeared impassive.
   Schnittjer had a hint of a smile on his face.
   Williams set sentencing for June 7 as attorneys for Kaub and
Sullivan said they would appeal the verdict.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica said he was pleased with
the convictions, which he called significant.``This sends a message
to corporate America that they cannot wash their hands of this type
of activity,'' he said after the four women and eight men returned
their verdict.
   He said the government's ``Ill Wind'' investigation into
kickbacks, payoffs and fraud in the Defense Department's
$150-billion-a-year purchasing system was ``expanding and
continuing.''
   The Pentagon procurement investigation began in mid-1986 but was
not publicly disclosed until June 1988, when federal agents armed
with search warrants descended on defense contractors from
coast-to-coast.
   The first indictment was handed up in January. Besides the three
Teledyne executives, it names private consultants William Parkin
and Fred Lackner; Stuart Berlin, a Navy official, and Teledyne
Industries, the parent of Teledyne Electronics.
   All pleaded guilty in advance of the trial execept for the
company officials. Teledyne pleaded guilty to conspiracy and filing
false statements. It paid $4.3 million in fines, penalties and
damages.
   During the trial, Parkin and Lackner testified they had paid
bribes to Berlin in exchange for his illegal help on the radar
contract Teledyne was awarded in July 1987. Berlin admitted
receiving Teledyne's money passed through the consultants.
   Aronica argued that Kaub, Sullivan and Schnittjer had conspired
to pay Parkin a total of $160,000 for his help on the radar
contract. Most of the money, $150,000, was to be paid after the
contract came through, he said.
   According to Aronica, the defendants, whom he described as
``smart ... capable ... and very, very careful,'' knew that Parkin
and his associates were engaged in illegitimate activites. ``Every
step possible was taken to conceal it,'' he said.
   Defense attorneys, however, said their clients were the victims
of a conspiracy devised by Parkin, Lackner, Berlin and Michael
Savaides, another former Teledyne employee who worked in Washington
and had pleaded guilty.
   ``My client was kept in the dark,'' George O'Connell, Sullivan's
lawyer, said in his closing argument.
   Much of the evidence in the case came from wire taps that the
government placed on Parkin's telephone. The jury listened to tapes
of the conservations between Parkin and the defendants. The wire
fraud counts stemmed from those tape-recorded conversations.
   Kaub was charged with filing false statements because he
authorized notifying the Defense Department that Teledyne had not
hired consultants to work on the radar contract.
   Schnittjer's attorney, Stanley Mortenson, said his client came
to Teledyne Electronics after the company had been awarded the
radar contract.
   But Aronica said Schnittjer was the person who paid Parkin more
than $18,000 of the $150,000 he was to receive once the Pentagon
ordered the equipment from Teledyne.
   Parkin, a former Navy official who worked for a variety of
defense contractors including Boeing, signed his original contract
with Teledyne in November 1985.
   Payments stopped once the Ill Wind investigation became public.
   The jury found Schnittjer innocent of four wire fraud counts,
but it could not reach a unanimous decision on whether Schnittjer
was guilty of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud.
   Williams, at Mortenson's request, dismissed those counts.

   The Iran-Contra independent counsel is
investigating allegations that Reagan administration officials
obstructed a Senate investigation into links between the Nicaraguan
Contras and drug traffickers, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said
Thursday.
   Kerry, who directed the investigation, said several people who
testified before his Foreign Relations subcommittee informed him
they were interviewed by investigators for independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh.
   A former Justice Department official and the former U.S.
attorney in Miami both told The Associated Press they were
interviewed by Walsh's investigators. Both denied any wrongdoing.
   Walsh's office, which is currently prosecuting former National
Security Council aide Oliver North, declined to comment.
   Kerry mentioned the obstruction investigation at a news
conference that he called to discuss the 437-page report of his
Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations.
   Despite Kerry's allegations of obstruction, the committee held
extensive hearings last year, concluding in its report that the
Reagan administration ``delayed, halted or interfered'' with its
own international anti-drug operations in order to protect its
Central America policy.
   The report said the administration looked the other way when law
enforcement agencies learned that drug traffickers were protected
and aided by some Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, by members
of the Honduran military, Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega
and Bahamian officials.
   The report also included a section on the alleged obstruction,
saying the Justice Department ``provided information to the
committee that tended to discredit'' allegations about Contra drug
links.
   The department, according to the report, kept telling the
subcommittee ``the persons who had made the allegations ... had
significant credibility problems'' and ``there was no truth to the
allegations.''
   The subcommittee concluded, however, that such links existed and
devoted a large section of the report to them.
   The report said a former assistant U.S. attorney in Miami,
Jeffrey Feldman, told the subcommittee that he learned of possible
obstruction of Kerry's committee during a meeting with Justice
Department officials on Nov. 18, 1987.
   Feldman said department officials told him that representatives
of the Justice Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration and
the FBI met in 1986 ``to discuss how Sen. Kerry's efforts could be
undermined.''
   Feldman, who helped uncover secret U.S. aid to the Contras
during a congressional ban on such assistance, told Kerry's panel
that he believed the Justice Department may have delayed his
investigation, too.
   ``It made sense that if the department didn't support your
investigation, then they wouldn't support my investigation,'' the
report quotes Feldman as telling the subcommittee.
   Feldman's former boss Leon B. Kellner, who was U.S. attorney in
Miami, said in an interview he was questioned by a Walsh
investigator late last year.
   Kellner said the interview concerned a confidential transcript
of a committee executive session that found its way to Kellner's
files.
   He said he received the transcript from the Justice Department,
but added he could not remember who gave it to him. And the copy he
received, Kellner added, did not indicate ``it was the transcript
of an executive sesssion'' on the committee's Contra investigation.
   Kenneth P. Bergquist, an assistant secretary of the Navy who
formerly served in the Justice Department's congressional affairs
office, said, ``I can confirm I was interviewed by an FBI agent
making inquiries about obstruction of Kerry's committee, about a
month ago. The FBI agent was working for Walsh.''
   The Kerry report said Bergquist was among the Justice Department
officials who tried to discredit the information the committee was
receiving on the Contras.
   Bergquist called the obstruction charges ``patently ridiculous.
It is unbelievable. Kerry is very quick with charges and I'm tired
of his lame accusations.''
   Bergquist said he attended the 1986 Justice Department meeting
during which Feldman said there was talk of undermining the
committee. But Bergquist said, ``No one said that the purpose of
that meeting was to undermine anybody.''
   Kerry told the news conference that anti-drug efforts in the
Reagan administration took second place to foreign policy mainly
``for fear of jeopardizing the war in Nicaragua.'' But he said that
same war provided an ``opportunity for drug traffickers to link up
with the Contras _ and they did.''
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, said in a written statement that while he agreed with
``substantial portions'' of the report, there were ``inaccuracies
in the representations of fact'' on the Contra-drug issue.

<HEAD>Campaign Against Peruvian Drug Traffickers Temporarily Suspended</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. paramilitary campaign against
Peruvian drug traffickers has been suspended temporarily as the
agents assigned to the operation reinforce their base camp, the
State Department said Thursday.
   Operation Snowcap, which involves agents of the Drug Enforcement
Administration who advise Peru's Civil Guard in eradicating coca
fields and cocaine-processing labs, was suspended in mid-February,
said Catherine Shaw of the department's office of International
Narcotics Matters.
   ``The operation's been suspended since mid-February,'' she said.
``They're regrouping, looking for ways to make the base camp more
secure.''
   Ms. Shaw said she was not aware of any particular threats
against the agents, but said, ``There have been, over the years,
many threats against the eradication workers.''
   Twenty-seven Peruvians were killed several years ago in the
eradication program, but she said it was not clear if the
assailants were drug traffickers or members of the violent Maoist
Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas, a rebel group that has
gained strength in the past few years.
   In late January, U.S. officials said the chief security officer
at the embassy in Lima was shot and wounded while on a helicopter
inspection of the area.
   ``When we're conviced and the Peruvians are convinced (the base
camp) is safe, we'll resume work,'' Ms. Shaw said. ``We're hoping
it won't be too far in the future.''
   Cornelius Dougherty, a DEA spokesman, said, ``There has been no
actual withdrawal of DEA agents. There's just been the normal
rotation.'' Agents who participate in Operation Snowcap are all
volunteers who spend only 90 days in the country at a time.
   ``There's a group down there now,'' Dougherty said. Although
they aren't participating in eradication measures, ``there's other
kinds of work that can be done down there, such as intelligence,
that sort of thing,'' he said.
   Neither Ms. Shaw nor Dougherty would reveal how many agents are
involved in Operation Snowcap, which has operations in Peru and
Bolivia.
   The suspension was disclosed Wednesday by Rep. William J.
Hughes, D-N.J., at a hearing of the House judiciary subcommittee on
crime, which he chairs.

   Assistant Attorney General Charles F. Rule,
who heads the Justice Department's antitrust division, will leave
April 28 to become a partner at the Covington &amp; Burling law firm
where he will work on antitrust matters, the law firm announced
Thursday.
   At the 250-attorney law firm, Rule will counsel U.S. clients and
will help the firm's newly opened London office in advising foreign
clients affected by U.S. antitrust policy.
   Last week, Rule said in a speech to American Bar Association
antitrust lawyers that the ``internationalization of antitrust
regulation'' is the most significant antitrust development of the
decade.
   Rule, who will be leaving the department on his 34th birthday
and joining the law firm May 1, joined the antitrust division in
1982. He graduated from Vanderbilt University and earned his law
degree at the University of Chicago.
   A leading candidate to replace Rule is James F. Rill, a senior
partner at the Washington law firm of Collier, Shannon, Rill &amp;
Scott.
   Rill, 56, who has been a chairman of the American Bar
Association's antitrust section, was described by an administration
official as ``one of the most highly regarded guys in the antitrust

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright said today that he
never ``knowingly or intentionally'' violated House rules, and
asked for ``the very earliest possible opportunity'' to answer
ethics committee charges against him.
   In a defiant defense of a lifetime in public life, Wright choked
back tears as he vowed to defend his wife, Betty, who figures in
the allegations against him. She is a ``a good decent, caring,
thoroughly honorable person,'' Wright said, ``and I'll damn well
fight to protect her honor and integrity from any challenge from
any source whatever the cost.''
   Wright's performance signaled his determination to fight
aggressively against the ethics committee charges _ allegations
that could ultimately lead to his removal as speaker.
   Wright spoke even before a formal announcement of the vote by
Democrats and Republicans on the ethics committee to pursue
allegations that he improperly accepted gifts from a business
partner and tried to evade outside income limits through the sale
of his books.
   He was flanked by a virtual who's who of House Democratic
leaders as he appeared before reporters. The scene unfolded in the
ornate Rayburn Room a few steps outside the House chamber _ a hall
named for another Texas Democrat who rose to become speaker of the
House.
   ``I will fight to the last ounce of conviction and energy that I
possess,'' Wright vowed.
   ``I am confident that in the 34 years I have served in the
Congress I have not violated any of those basic rules or any
commonly accepted standard of ethical conduct,'' said Wright.
   ``I am prepared to demonstrate that in each of these instances
no rule has been violated,'' Wright said of the ethics committee
charges.
   ``This House has been my life for more than half of my life,''
Wright said. ``I love this institution.''
   Wright made a detailed defense against the allegations he faces
after noting that the ethics committee had not yet established any
proof that he had violated the rules, or even that there was
``clear and convincing evidence'' of a violation.
   The public scene came after a private defense.
   The last of the ethics decisions were reached Wednesday on
strong bipartisan votes, according to sources familiar with the
panel's probe. The votes mean the panel has found ``reason to
believe'' Wright violated a series of House rules, and they point
toward a new phase of the case which could involve a disciplinary
hearing and possible punishment.
   Wright's spokesman, Mark Johnson, said late Wednesday that the
speaker had not been informed of any decision by the panel. ``All
options are open'' in defending against the charges, he said.
   The action essentially completed the committee's 10-month, $1.5
million investigation of Wright's finances. The panel was meeting
again today to work on the specific wording of its report detailing
the basis for the charges against the speaker, one source said.
   The panel has met behind closed doors and under tight secrecy
for three weeks to deliberate the recommendations of its special
outside counsel, Chicago attorney Richard Phelan.
   In the final days of that process, committee members narrowed
their focus to the two most serious issues before them: the
acceptance of gifts from a person with an interest in legislation
and the evasion of outside income limits.
   On Wednesday, the committee voted that benefits received from
Fort Worth developer George Mallick from 1980 through 1984, valued
at more than $100,000, amounted to unreported ``gifts'' that were
improper because Mallick, an investor in real estate and oil and
gas ventures, had a greater interest in congressional legislation
than an ordinary citizen, said one source.
   The panel also concluded that Wright, in roughly half a dozen
instances, had foregone speaking fees from groups he had addressed
and instead sold them bulk quantities of his book, ``Reflections of
a Public Man.'' Under House rules, speaking fees are subject to
limits, while book royalties are not.
   Most difficult for the committee, sources said, was the issue of
whether Mallick, a longtime friend of Wright, had motives other
than friendship when he paid the speaker's wife, Betty, $18,000 a
year in salary and gave the Wrights rent-free use of a condominium
and a 1979 Cadillac.
   House rules prohibit the acceptance of more than $100 a year in
gifts from anyone with a direct interest in legislation.
   Ultimately, a majority of the panel's six Democrats and six
Republicans agreed with special counsel Phelan that the standard
for whether an individual has ``a direct interest in legislation
before the Congress'' should be a broad one. Phelan argued that
because of Mallick's extensive real estate and oil and gas
holdings, Mallick was inherently interested in what goes on in
Congress.
   That decision has major implications for future ethics standards
in the House, and was troubling to some members of the committee
because it seemed to suggest that members of Congress must be
restricted in their friendships.
   ``People are trying to invent a rule that isn't there,'' argued
Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., reacting earlier Wednesday to reports of
the committee's activities. Obey was the primary author of the 1977
rules revisions under which the House operates. ``We were not
drawing up a gift rule that would impinge upon people's normal,
longstanding friendships,'' he said.
   The next step for the ethics panel is to issue a formal
statement of the allegations against Wright. The speaker then will
have 21 days to present rebuttals and counter-arguments before the
committee determines whether to call for a disciplinary hearing to
decide whether sanctions are warranted.
   Sanctions can range from a simple reprimand to expulsion from
the House.
   Even before the panel's conclusions were known Wednesday,
Democratic lawmakers were nervous and began to look ahead to the
issue's political fallout.
   One member of the Democratic leadership, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, said if the ethics committee recommends any
punishment for Wright, he will be ``automatically out'' as speaker.
``There's no option,'' the lawmaker said.

<TEXT>
   The USS Samuel B. Roberts, crippled a
year ago when it struck a mine in the Persian Gulf, is back in the
water for the conclusion of a $90 million repair job intended to
make it better than new.
   After six months in dry dock, the 445-foot guided missile
frigate was refloated early this month at Bath Iron Works, where
the complicated repairs are expected to be finished in October, a
month ahead of schedule.
   The Roberts and its sister ship, the USS Stark, were damaged
while on duty in the Persian Gulf during the war between Iran and
Iraq. The frigates are the first U.S. warships to undergo repairs
for battle damage since the Korean War.
   The Stark was repaired at the Ingalls Shipyard in Pascagoula,
Miss., at a cost of $82.9 million and rejoined the fleet last
summer. Thirty-seven crew members were killed when the Stark was
hit by a missile fired from an Iraqi jet on May 17, 1987.
   The 3,700-ton Roberts was damaged on April 14, 1988 when it hit
an Iranian mine while escorting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the
gulf. Ten sailors were injured.
   The blast, which nearly sank the Roberts, hit amidships below
the waterline. It demolished the engine room, carved a 22-foot gash
in the hull and forced a repair job even more complex than the
Stark's.
   ``From the standpopair.''
   It was the type of damage sustained by a car that goes off a
road and lands on a boulder, destroying the entire drive train but
leaving the external structure intact, said Cmdr John W. Townes
III, who took over as skipper after the Roberts was damaged.
   The repairs to the Stark and the Roberts have been viewed as
tests of both the shipbuilding industry's ability to reconstruct
today's high-tech warships and the nation's political resolve in
putting battle-damaged vessels back in action swiftly and
effectively, Navy and shipyard officials say.
   Supervisors at Bath Iron Works, which built the Roberts three
years ago, say the task of repairing a modern warship and its
computer-controlled propulsion system poses a unique technological
challenge.
   ``What has not been done before is putting an electronic engine
room back together. There's a world of difference between this
engine room and the ones in the World War II destroyers,'' Price
said.
   Congress authorized $96 million for the repair job, and BIW says
the costs are running $2 million to $3 million under budget. The
Roberts cost roughly $350 million when it was built and outfitted.

<TEXT>
   The defense minister has rejected suggestions for
converting the Soviet armed forces into an all-volunteer unit half
its current size.
   ``I am shaken by the incompetence and light-mindedness of the
authors of such `innovations' when they approach the most important
state question, the guarantee of the security of the country,''
Dmitri T. Yazov said in a front-page signed article published
Thursday in the military newspaper Red Star.
   Yazov seemed to support the unilateral reductions already
announced by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They would cut the
armed forces by 500,000 men to 3,760,000. Yazov also said weapons
production is being cut by one-fifth.
   But he was sharply critical of suggestions the army could be cut
in half, indicating the top Soviet brass was in favor of
maintaining compulsory military service for males.
   Deferrals for university students were announced last month.
They still must serve in the armed forces after graduation,
although their term of service has been reduced to one year.
   A highly paid volunteer army would become an elite class in
society, contradicting the nature of a socialist army where
everyone is drafted, Yazov said. Ideals of duty to the country
would be replaced by materialism, he said.
   Yazov also said a volunteer army under capitalism serves the
interest of the ruling class _ a criticism that brings Communist
ideology back into a debate that often has centered on efficiency
and budget-cutting.
   Lt. Col. Alexander Savinkin opened the debate last fall with an
article in the Moscow News weekly calling for a smaller, more
professional, all-volunteer army with better training in
high-technology weaponry.
   Yazov said the current two- to three-year hitch is sufficient
for the average soldier to learn discipline and the use of certain
arms.
   A separate article in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda
written by the armed forces' deputy political director, Adm. A.
Sorokin, said one-fifth of the 500,000 troops cut from the military
would be officers, typically those with only a few years service.
Cadets in military academies also will be trimmed, he said.
   Generally, the troop cuts will be among older soldiers ready to
retire because they have qualified for pensions or received
apartments, Sorokin said.
   In addition, he wrote, ``We are not keeping a secret of the fact
that we are trying to get rid of those who are not in harmony with
morality, honor and duty.''
   Sorokin admitted that finding homes for 500,000 released
soldiers will be no easy task in a country already struggling with
a severe housing shortage.
   Plans have been made to build 7,500 apartments for former
officers, but for the rest, the Communist Party leadership and
local authorities ``must take urgent measures'' to find housing, he
said.

   Federal investigators have identified a
handful of passengers who unwittingly may have brought aboard the
bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in December, a
Bush administration official said Thursday.
   CBS reported Wednesday that suspicion had centered on a member
of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command who is a relative of Hafez Dalkamoni. CBS said Dalkamoni
reportedly set up the network that carried out the attack in which
270 people, including 189 Americans, perished.
   An administration official knowledgeable about the investigation
disputed the CBS account that investigators had concluded the
passenger who carried the bomb aboard was Khalid Jaafar, a young
American-Lebanese college student returning to Michigan from
Frankfurt for the Christmas holidays.
   Federal Bureau of Investigation agents have questioned Jaafar's
parents at the family-run gas station in Detroit but the parents
insist he was not involved.
   The official said Jaafar was only one of several passengers
suspected of unwittingly bringing the explosive aboard. ``And no
one in the Popular Front is talking,'' said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Another government source said the ``chief theory'' of
investigators is that the bombing was the work of the
Syrian-sponsored Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   Investigators theorize that the group, headed by Ahmed Jabril,
may have carried out the attack at the behest of Iran, said the
source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The group was identified Wednesday in a State Department
terrorism report to Congress as having carried out numerous
cross-border attacks against Israel and violently opposed to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Jabril is identified as a former captain in the Syrian army. The
group is closely allied with Syria and probably receives directions
from Syria, its chief sponsor.
   CBS said many of the leads in the case are coming from a member
of the front who is cooperating with investigators. But the U.S.
official told The Associated Press that ``there is nothing that
links the command directly right now with Flight 103.''
   The London Daily Telegraph reported, meanwhile, that
investigators had narrowed the number of people suspected of being
duped into carrying the bomb aboard to three to five American
passport holders who probably joined the flight in Frankfurt.
   The newspaper said FBI agents were searching European cities to
find the terrorist who gave the passenger the radio-cassette player
in which investigators have confirmed the bomb was placed.
   Investigators have narrowed the probe's focus, the investigation
chief said Thursday. The Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser, Scotland's
chief law officer who is ultimately responsible for the crash
investigation, said in a statement:
   ``There has been a narrowing in the focus of the inquiry but it
would be inadvisable for me to comment on these reports at this
stage. Any statement I make on the progress of the investigation
must be based on firm evidence and not on the basis of comment or
conjecture attributed to official sources.
   ``If there is firm evidence which can be revealed without
prejudicing the inquiry or the prospects for a criminal
prosecution, disclosure of that will be authorized.''
   The Pan Am jumbo jet crashed in southern Scotland on Dec. 21,
killing all 259 people aboard and 11 people on the ground.
   Dalkamoni was in prison at the time, having been picked up last
October following a raid on one of his safe houses. Along with
weapons, German police found three Toshiba radio-cassette players
similar to the one used to blow up Pan Am 103, CBS said.
   Meanwhile, an administration source sadi Thursday that President
Bush will visit Lockerbie, stopping on the way back from a NATO
summit in Brussels, Belgium and visits to Italy, England and West
Germany. He is scheduled to leave Washington on May 26 and return
June 1 or 2.
   A White House survey team already has visited Lockerbie and an
advance team is expected to stop there within the next week for
further planning, said the source, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Bush recently met at the White House with a delegation of
relatives of victims of the Pan Am flight.

<TEXT>
   A New Jersey company is recalling extension
power strips sold in North Carolina and the Washington, D.C., area
because they could give users a severe electrical shock, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday.
   The power strip is a foot-long, beige-colored bar containing six
ordinary electrical receptacles, an on-off switch, a circuit
breaker and a three-wire power cord six feet long.
   The base is labeled ``Temporary Power Tap Model No. WP-002B,
Made in Taiwan, UL 46K7, E95914.''
   The receptacles might not be grounded, the commission said. So
far, no injuries have been reported.
   About 6,700 strips were sold for $10 to $20 in 1987 and 1988 by
Rose's Stores of Henderson, N.C., Colonial Pottery of Morehead
City, N.C., and Trak Auto Stores, which operate in the Washington
area from headqaurters in Landover, Md., a Washington suburb, the
commission said.
   The importer, Collins Company Ltd. of Mount Olive, N.J., said
owners could return the strips to Trak, Rose's or Colonial for a
refund, according to the commission.
   Owners also may write Collins at 450 Clark Drive, Mount Olive,
N.J. 07828 or call 1-800-645-7212 extension 207 for instructions on
returning the strips.

<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department report said Thursday
that farm cooperatives showed a sharp rise in net income in 1987,
reaching the highest level since 1980.
   The department's Agricultural Cooperative Service said net
income rose to $1.5 billion, more than double the $688 million
reported for 1986, and was ``the first major reversal in recent
declines'' suffered during the farm crunch of the early 1980s.
   According to the report, published in the agency's Farmer
Cooperatives magazine, the estimates covered 5,109 marketing, farm
supply and selected service co-ops having a 1987 combined gross of
$74 billion.
   ``All groups, except those marketing rice and sugar, and those
providing selected services, showed 1987 increases in net income,''
the report said. ``The largest recovery occurred in the farm supply
group. Those cooperatives earned net income of $351 million after
experiencing net losses of $66 million in 1986.''
   The report said other groups also showed ``generally strong
turnarounds'' in 1987. Those included co-ops marketing fruits and
vegetables; cotton; grain and soybeans; and livestock, wool and
poultry.
   Net worth of co-ops, total liabilities and total assets all grew
in 1987, the report said _ assets, 4.3 percent to $27.6 billion;
liabilities, 1.5 percent to $14.8 billion; and net worth, 7.8
percent to a record $12.8 billion.

<TEXT>
   A 13th body was found today at a ranch
used by a drug-smuggling cult that allegedly committed human
sacrifices to make its members invulnerable, while authorities
conducted an international manhunt for the group's ``godfather.''
   Police took suspect Sergio Martinez to the ranch, where he
pointed out the site where a 13th body was buried. Police then gave
him a pick and a shovel and had him dig the body up himself.
   ``You'll do it with your hands if you have to,'' one officer
told Martinez.
   The body, a man in his 30s, had been buried about four months
ago, Martinez said.
   U.S. and Mexican authorities were searching for Adolfo de Jesus
Constanzo, a Cuban who police said orchestrated the ritual slayings
on a remote ranch outside of this Mexican border town.
   Constanzo is believed to have fled into the United States with
Matamoros resident Sara Maria Aldrete, a 24-year-old, 6-foot-1
brunette described by Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox as the
``witch of the operation.''
   A wanted poster issued by the Cameron County Sheriff's
Department in Texas described her as ``extremely dangerous. Use
caution.''
   In Miami, television station WPLG reported Wednesday night that
Metro-Dade police have been alerted that Constanzo was believed to
be heading toward the Florida city.
   Also Wednesday, in a manner not seen in the United States,
Mexican police individually displayed four of five detained
suspects in front of scores of media representatives, who subjected
them to a barrage of questions.
   ``We killed them for protection,'' said suspect Elio Hernandez
Rivera, 22 of Matamoros.
   He added that he shot one victim and decapitated another.
   Police pulled up Hernandez Rivera's shirt and jacket to show
scars on his shoulders and back. One was shaped like an arrow,
which authorities said signified he was authorized by the cult to
make human sacrifices that were intended as protection from police,
bullets or other threats to their drug-smuggling operation.
   Hernandez Rivera did not comment on the scars.
   Among the group's victims exhumed Tuesday were a Mexican
policeman, a federal police volunteer, a 16-year-old boy and Mark
Kilroy, a 21-year-old University of Texas premedical student who
disappeared March 14 in Matamoros while on spring break.
   Mexican police believe two victims were executed as revenge for
a drug deal that went bad. Hernandez Rivera said some were killed
out of vengeance rather than as sacrifices.
   Mattox said the ranch apparently was used as a drug-smuggling
base, and members were smuggling about 1,000 pounds of marijuana a
month into the United States.
   At least one victim was kidnapped in the Texas border city of
Brownsville within the last month, and up to three may be U.S.
citizens, officials said.
   Constanzo killed Kilroy, said one of the arrested men, Serafin
Hernandez Garcia, 22, a U.S. citizen from Brownsville.
   Constanzo apparently introduced a sort of voodoo or black magic
to the area, said Oran Neck, the U.S. Customs chief agent in
Brownsville, just across the Rio Grande.
   The four suspects said they followed Constanzo's orders to
kidnap people.
   Another suspect, David Serna Valdez, a 22-year-old agronomy
student from Matamoros, said he did not know about murders when he
was recruited.
   Felipe Flores, spokesman for the Mexican attorney general's
office, said victims' brains were cut out and put on a fire, mixed
with blood, herbs, rooster feet, goat heads and turtles.
   Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez said cult members removed some
victims' vertebrae for use in necklaces.
   Contrary to officials' earlier assertions, no evidence of
cannibalism was found, Neck said.
   The five suspects were detained pending the filing of formal
charges of murder, kidnapping, drug smuggling, criminal association
and possession of illegal firearms, said Jose Silva Arroyo,
narcotics supervisor for the Mexican Federal Judicial Police.
   The police were on a routine drug search when they found the
dismembered bodies Tuesday in shallow graves at the ranch.
   Some victims were shot in the head, and others appeared to have
been slain with machetes or sledgehammers, Neck said.
   Kilroy apparently was chosen at random after the cult members
``were told to pick one Anglo male that particular night,'' said
Cameron County Sheriff's Lt. George Gavito.
   ``I didn't kill him, but the others who killed him hit him with
a machete,'' Hernandez Garcia said.
   Perez said suspects confessed to removing Kilroy's brain and
spine and chopping off his legs. In some forms of witchcraft,
removal of the brain signifies a sacrifice of the victim's soul.
   ``I think they must be possessed by the devil. That would be the
only explanation for what they did,'' Kilroy's mother, Helen, said.
``I will pray for them so they will realize how wrong all this is.''
   A memorial service was scheduled for Kilroy tonight in
Brownsville. In Kilroy's hometown of Santa Fe, Texas, a yellow
ribbon ceremony had been scheduled for Wednesday to draw attention
to his disappearance. After his remains were discovered, it became
a memorial service.

   The government has filed a complaint, seeking
$1.4 million in fines, against an Illinois manufacturer of
catalytic converter replacement pipes that the Environmental
Protection Agency maintains are ineffective.
   The complaint was filed by the Justice Department on behalf of
the EPA in federal court in Chicago against Ced's Inc., of Addison,
Ill., the EPA said Thursday.
   The EPA accused the company, which also does business as
Products for Power, of failing to abide by a 1987 settlement
agreement in which the company allegedly said it would pay $75,000
in fines and stop selling the replacement pipes.
   ``Despite the widespread misperception that these pipes will
improve vehicle performance, they are merely lengths of plain
exhaust tubing cut to fit in place of catalytic converters and
offer no performance advantages over properly functioning catalytic
converters,'' said the EPA.
   The pipes ``dramatically increase emissions of
health-threatening pollutants by releasing untreated exhaust
gases,'' said Don Clay, acting EPA assistant administrator for air
and radiation.
   The action filed in federal court asks that the company pay
$135,000 in civil penalties for failing to comply with the 1987
agreement and $2,500 in additional penalties per day that it was in
non-compliance. The overall fine would exceed $1.4 million, the
agency said.

   Yuri V. Dubinin, the Soviet ambassador to the
United States, accused the Bush administration on Thursday of
moving too slowly on bilateral negotiations.
   Dubinin urged the administration, which has been conducting a
``strategic review'' of security policies, to spell out its
positions before Secretary of State James A. Baker III's scheduled
May 10-11 visit to Moscow. The review is to be completed by May 10.
   ``Soviet-American dialogue is essential to building new
international relations,'' Dubinin said in a speech at a meeting of
the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   ``Apparently, this is the reason why more and more questions are
being asked in the U.S.S.R. and throughout the world as to when the
Soviet-American dialogue will be resumed in its entirety,'' he said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev voiced similar complaints
last week during a visit to Great Britain. Bush countered
Gorbachev's statements by saying that his administration was
``making a prudent review. ... Mr. Gorbachev knows there is no
foot-dragging going on.''
   Dubinin said that ``as to the Soviet Union, we are prepared to
resume the negotiations at any moment'' on strategic arms, human
rights, regional problems, bilateral relations and other issues.
   The ambassador brushed aside a question about whether the Soviet
sale of bombers to Libya contradicted its stated desire to shift to
a more peaceful foreign policy.
   ``Yes, we have sold several units of this aircraft to Libya. But
it was done a lot of time ago,'' said Dubinin.
   ``They are not modern aircraft. They are not so modern as those
that Israel has. ... That is why it is not at all a basis to put
into question the new policies in the Soviet Union, the new
thinking in our policy,'' he said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, following Dubinin before
the same audience, said the sale worried his government.
   ``It obliges us to remain always ready to face any surprise,''
said Shamir. ``We are very sorry that we cannot see in this regard
any change in Soviet policy in our area. So far there is continuity
... the Soviets are selling arms to their clients,'' Libya and
Syria.
   U.S. officials said last week that the Soviet Union had sold
Libya Su-24 bombers, with ranges of up to 800 miles, enough to
reach Egypt or Israel, two nations with which Libya has hostile
relations.
   Last week, Soviet foreign ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov said the Soviet Union sold six short-range bombers to
Libya under a 1986 contract, but did not identify the planes by
name.

   A commission is investigating whether soldiers
used shovels to beat nationalist demonstrators in Soviet Georgia
during a clash in which 19 people died, a government spokesman said
Thursday.
   In the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, scene of the Sunday
confrontation, an estimated 2,000 people marched through the
streets for the first funeral for one of the victims, psychiatrist
Zia Djinjaradze, 42, according to a local human rights activist.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, reported Georgian activists
have changed their tactics in the face of Soviet troops keeping
order in Tbilisi, and are handing out handwritten leaflets to press
for a general strike.
   The Georgian Communist Party's ruling Politburo met Thursday and
said the situation remained ``strained,'' with universities and
schools still shut by boycotts. It said factories and public
transport were operating normally.
   The Tass news agency, in its report on the meeting, gave no word
on leadership changes. Local party chief Dzhumber I. Patiashvili
offered to resign Tuesday after accepting responsibility for
Sunday's events. Approval by the Georgian party's Central Committee
would be necessary to replace Patiashvili.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news
briefing in Moscow that a commission investigating charges of
brutality in Tbilisi was probing whether soldiers who broke up the
protest by pro-independence forces were in possession of short
metal shovels customarily used for digging trenches.
   ``The troops were not supposed to have those spades,'' Gerasimov
said.
   If an investigation finds soldiers beat the protesters with
shovels, ``there is a question of whether these people should be
punished or not,'' he said.
   However, Gerasimov justified the decision to clear the square of
protesters, saying, ``We should take into account the situation
which evolved, since endless meetings lasted for five days and they
all but paralyzed the work of enterprises, and people also
attempted to penetrate the territory of government institutions.''
   Patiashvili said he did not expect fatalities when troops were
ordered to break up the demonstration outside Tbilisi's Government
House because they were equipped only with nightsticks and shields.
But several Georgians who spoke in telephone interviews said the
soldiers also were carrying shovels.
   Sergei Dandurov, a human rights activist, said police and troops
made no attempt to stop Ms. Djinjaradze's funeral cortege as it
wound through streets near Tbilisi's university at 4 p.m.
   ``They didn't create obstacles to the funeral,'' Dandurov said.
He said some policemen even joined the marchers, whom he estimated
numbered 2,000.
   At the site of the bloody confrontation, a spontaneous memorial
has appeared, piled with fresh flowers, said an editor at
Akhalgarda Kommunisti, the Georgian Communist Party youth newspaper.
   Pravda said pickets in Tbilisi were calling on workers to
strike. But Gerasimov said all enterprises were working, and that
only the university and some schools remained disrupted by strikes.
   The curfew remains in effect, and alcohol sales have been
restricted, Gerasimov said. Foreign reporters have been barred from
traveling to Tbilisi since unrest there began.
   Red Star, the military daily, said groups of 15-20 activists
were passing out leaflets and spreading rumors in the city of 1.2
million people 900 miles south of Moscow.
   Some leaflets contain lists which claim to identify further
victims of Sunday's clash beyond the 19 officially confirmed dead,
said the Akhalgadra Kommunisti editor, who refused to give his name.
   Activists also have been ripping down the announcements of the
military command, according to Red Star. Dandurov said two statues
of Bolsheviks who helped establish Soviet power in the Caucasus _
Sergei Kirov and Sergo Ordzhonikidze _ also were vandalized.
   Tbilisi was shaken by a minor earthquake Thursday, shortly after
noon local time. Tass said the jolt measured only 5 on the 12-point
Soviet scale at the epicenter in the mountains 60 miles to the
east, and only 4 in the capital of the republic.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a Georgian who served
as the region's party chief from 1972 to 1985, was at the meeting
of Georgian party leaders Thursday. He has canceled trips to East
Germany and West Germany because of the unrest.
   On Wednesday, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed for calm
in Georgia in a message read on local radio and television and
carried in the press. He rejected the demands of nationalists who
seek secession from the Soviet Union, and blamed them for igniting
the strife he said was damaging his reform drive.
   The trouble in Tbilisi started when protesters criticized calls
from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian minority to break
away because of alleged discrimination by Georgians.
   Other protesters demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet Union
because of alleged interference from the central government and
Russians in the republic's political, economic and cultural affairs.

<HEAD>Moslem Guerrillas Sever Key Afghan Route to Moscow</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday that
Moslem guerrillas cut the major supply route from the Soviet Union
and are preventing food convoys from moving on the key eastern road
from Pakistan.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani also said the
insurgents' fight to take the strategic eastern city of Jalalabad
has slackened. The heavy rocket and artillery attack has dwindled
to sporadic gunfire, he said.
   Amani said the anti-communist fighters have blocked the Salang
Highway at two towns north of the capital, Olang and Jabalassanaa,
cutting off Kabul's only land link with the Soviet border.
   Security forces have launched an extensive mopping-up operation
and hope to reopen the highway Friday, he said.
   Diplomats in Kabul said the blockade has nearly 140,000 tons of
food piled up at the Soviet border. Amani said the last convoy
brought food on April 6.
   But diplomats say the highway has been closed for at least two
weeks and is severely damaged in some places. They credit the
closure to guerrilla commander Ahmed Shah Masood and his group,
Jamati-I-Islami. The insurgents say they control 20 miles of the
highway.
   A Soviet airlift of food and military equipment continues to
Kabul. But it carries less than half the 650 tons of flour that
residents need each day.
   In the east, Amani said, only military convoys have traveled in
the past two weeks on the highway to Jalalabad, the key route to
Pakistan.
   ``People are afraid and don't want to travel,'' but conditions
have improved, he said.
   ``The severity of the situation in Jalalabad has decreased in
the past 24 hours,'' Amani said.
   One government soldier was killed in sporadic gunfire, and the
troops killed 35 insurgents and wounded 38 others, he said.
   The fight for Jalalabad is the first guerrilla offensive since
the Soviet Union completed its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan on
Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated accord.
   If Jalalabad fell, it would be the biggest city the insurgents
have captured and would give them momentum to advance on Kabul, 70
miles to the west.
   The capital has been relatively quiet this week, with few
incoming rockets.
   Elsewhere, Amani said, guerrillas continued attacks on the
southern towns of Khost and Ghazni.
   In Khost, soldiers killed 185 guerrillas and lost nine troops.
Nine civilians were wounded and two houses destroyed, he said.
There were no casualties in Ghazni, he said.
   It is impossible to verify government or guerrilla reports on
the state of the war. Both sides sometimes exaggerate.
   Amani said government troops foiled a guerrilla attempt to move
weapons and ammunition through the mountains of Paghamn region east
of Kabul. Soldiers fired on the guerrillas, who were carrying the
weapons on donkeys and mules to fellow fighters in northern
Afghanistan, he said without mentioning casualties.
   Government troops had another success on Tuesday, he said, when
they forced guerrillas to retreat from Sarobi town, halfway between
Kabul and Jalalabad and the site of a power station that supplies
electricity to Kabul.
   The insurgents, who call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic holy
warriors, have been fighting nearly 11 years to topple the
Marxists, who seized power in a coup.
   Moscow backs the Afghan government, while Saudi Arabia, the
United States, Pakistan and China support the mujahedeen.

<HEAD>Senators Introduce Medicaid Home Care Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has made it too
difficult for states to use Medicaid to pay for home care services
for the poor, according to six senators who introduced a measure
Thursday designed to remedy the situation.
   The legislation is aimed at thousands of Medicaid beneficiaries
who need help with their home routines, but whose sickness or
frailty is not severe enough to require them to enter a nursing
home.
   The bill, designed to cut through red tape to make it easier for
states to pay for at least part of the cost of home care under
Medicaid, was unveiled at a news conference by its author, Sen. Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va. The co-sponsors are Sens. John Heinz, R-Pa.,
Paul Simon, D-Ill., George Mitchell, D-Maine, Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
and David Pryor, D-Ark.
   In 1981, the government approved interim regulations authorizing
states to get waivers to pay for home care under Medicaid, a
federal program providing medical services to the needy.
   The regulations specify that such care can be provided in the
homes using Medicaid funds only if it saves money over hospital or
nursing home care.
   The bill, estimated to cost $680 million over the first five
years, would end the waiver system and make home care services an
optional, statewide benefit.

   A prisoner who escaped from a courthouse
stopped two blocks away to get a shave and a haircut and was
captured afterward still wearing his handcuffs and a waist chain.
   Cathy Brekke said the man came into her barbershop Tuesday and
was in a hurry to have his hair cut and his beard and moustache
shaved off.
   ``He was sweating like a pig and wouldn't take off his jacket,''
she said. ``He was real uncomfortable when he was getting his hair
shampooed. He told me he'd been hit by a truck.''
   Brekke said she didn't noticie anything unusual until he
remained in the shop to use the telephone after his haircut.
   She said she ``kept seeing something metal,'' though the
handcuffs were under his sleeves and the chain around his waist was
inside his sportscoat. She finally realized he was handcuffed and
called police from a nearby restaurant.
   Police arrested Rick Savaria, 33, who had escaped two hours
earlier from a line of eight prisoners at the county courthouse,
said Undersheriff Chuck Maxwell.
   Maxwell said authorities will seek felony escape charges against
Savaria, who had been awaiting sentencing on a theft charge.

<HEAD>Khomeini's Rushdie Condemnation Unrelated to `Verses,' Editors Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading writer on Islamic militancy said
Thursday that the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order to
assassinate Salman Rushdie, author of the novel ``Satanic Verses,''
had nothing to do with revulsion over the contents of the book.
   Robin Wright, herself once the target of a Mideast death threat,
said that Khomeini, seizing upon the growing fury among Sunni and
Shiite Moslems over the book, issued the edict against Rushdie in a
bid to gain the leadership of the entire Islamic world.
   Ms. Wright, author ``Sacred Rage: the Wrath of Militant Islam,''
and the upcoming ``In the Name of God: Khomeini's Revolutionary
Decade,'' said Khomeini also was using the issue to divert
attention from domestic problems, just as he created the U.S.
hostage crisis in 1979 to mobilize public support for his troubled
regime.
   But ``I suspect that Khomeini is in a minority'' among Iranian
clerics and political leaders on the issue of Rushdie, she said,
noting the assassination order ``has erased most of the diplomatic
gains made by Iran since the end of the war with Iraq.'' She
predicted history will view the episode as ``a tragic spasm.''
   Ms. Wright, a national security reporter for The Los Angeles
Times, was among participants in a seminar on the Rushdie affair at
the annual convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
Others included author Larry McMurtry; Ed Murrow, president of the
American Booksellers Association, and Andy Ross, whose Berkeley,
Calif., bookstore, Cody's, was bombed in February after it began
selling ``Satanic Verses.''
   Ross described in wrenching terms the anguish he and his 55
employees went through in arriving at their joint decision to
resume sales of the book after a Molotov cocktail damaged the
store, but caused no injuries, in the early hours of Feb. 28.
``It's quite possible my store has the dubious honor of being the
first victim of international terrorism in the United States,'' he
said.
   Ross said ``the bombing accomplished its goal, which was to
create an atmosphere of terror, and to let the world know that
under the new order of things, the sale of prescribed ideas could
be conducted only at great personal risk.''
   ``I can tell you that the decision to carry the `Verses' (after
the bombing) was perhaps the most difficult decision of my life,''
he said. ``If people were murdered, who is to say if such an act
(selling the book) was courageous or foolhardy?''
   Ross expressed some bitterness over criticism within the
literary community of bookstores that withdrew the book from their
shelves. ``I personally thought it was unbecoming for Norman Mailer
and others to expound from the safety of their coop apartments what
was correct moral behavior for bookstores in the front lines,
stores on the street vulnerable to terrorist activity 24 hours a
day,'' he said.
   He also said that the ``role of the media was a source of
paradox. The level of coverage was an element that only inflamed
the fanatics. The more you exericized your freedom of expression in
reporting the story, the greater the likelihood that my freedom of
expression would be abridged by terror.''
   Ms. Wright, once threatened with death for reporting an
attempted coup against Syrian leader Hafez Assad, said she did not
doubt that Khomeini was ``genuinely outraged by the comic and
almost pornographic approach to Islam taken in `Satanic Verses.'''
   But she noted the assassination order, coupled with a $5.2
million bounty offer, was not issued until mid-February, five
months after publication.
   Rushdie, born in India of Moslem parents, and his American wife,
author Mary Wiggins, went into hiding, presumably in England,
shortly after Khomeini's order.
   The book includes a brothel scene in which prostitutes take the
names of the prophet Mohammed's wives, and it suggest Mohammed
wrote the holy Koran instead of receiving it from Allah.
   Ms. Wright noted that Islam ``is not the only religion to
condemn those who engage in blasphemy.'' She cited a passage from
the book of Leviticus in the Old Testament: ``He that blasphemes
the name of the Lord ... shall surely be put to death, and all the
congregation shall certainly stone him.''
   McMurtry, author of ``Lonesome Dove'' and other best-sellers,
said that ``tyrants, whether secular or religious, have exhibited
far more respect for language than have democratic governments.
Tyrants demonstrate that respect by sending their most able and
threatening servants, the best writers, to the stake, the block or
the gulag.''
   He complained that the response of Western governments to
Khomeini's order, ``insofar as they've responded at all, has been a
light noise, sounds without significance or without force. In time,
virtually all communications will be weakened without unfettered
freedom to express ourselves as we need to.''
   But Ross said ``I was not exceedingly disturbed by the almost
insultingly bland statements by public officials, including
President Bush, because they at least had the value of not inciting
additional violence.''

   An incident in which a National Guard private
fired 14 shots from an M-16 rifle into the air in a neighborhood
has led to a policy change.
   Guardsmen will be forbidden to leave Guard property with a
weapon, said Col. Raymond Murphy, Massachusetts National Guard
chief of staff.
   ``This will really tighten things up,'' he said. ``The comander
of the battalion will know at all times where his weapons are.''
   Under the policy announced Wednesday, all weapons will be
transported in locked trucks to training sites and issued to
guardsmen there.
   Private Edward J. Silva carried his automatic rifle and 80
rounds of ammunition on a trip from Camp Edwards in Bourne to the
National Guard armory in Boston's Dorchester section April 1.
   He told investigators he found the armory closed, took the
weapon home, went drinking with friends and fired the gun to
impress them, authorities said.
   He pleaded innocent in Dorchester District Court to charges of
unauthorized possession of a machine gun, larceny, speeding,
discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a building, disorderly
conduct and receiving a stolen vehicle.

   Members of Congress introduced legislation
Thursday calling for the creation of a Pacific Basin Forum that
would enable the United States and Asian nations to deal with
issues such as free trade and economic development.
   ``The United States has a pressing need to reinvigorate our
diplomatic efforts in the Pacific region, an area currently
undergoing a radical transformation,'' said Senate Democratic Whip
Alan Cranston of California in introducing the measure.
   Cranston, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee
on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said China, Japan and South
Korea are experiencing an economic boom that is straining relations
with the United States, which has a trade deficit.
   ``I propose that the United States promote the establishment of
a Pacific Basin Forum to pursue such crucial issues as free trade,
economic development and security confidence building,'' Cranston
said.
   The forum also would hold annual summit meetings involving the
leaders of the Asian nations and the United States, establish a
permanent secretariat for research and encourage private sector
involvement in planning.
   Cranston said the forum would resemble NATO and the annual
economic summits with European leaders, but stressed that he wasn't
encouraging the creation of an ``Asian trading bloc to rival the
Common Market.''
   ``I do believe it is manifestly in the American interest to
design a forum for focused discussion of these and related issues
among Pacific Rim nations,'' he said. ``And I do believe it would
serve our purposes to remind our friends in Europe that we have
important trade interests elsewhere.''
   Additional sponsors of Cranston's legislation were Sens. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind.; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and
Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska. Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., introduced
similar legislation in the House.

   Outgoing White House science adviser William
R. Graham Jr. on Thursday criticized ``overly rigid
compartmentalization'' of U.S. research and development efforts,
arguing that a more coordinated strategy is needed to meet the
challenges of global competition.
   Graham, a holdover from the Reagan administration, questioned
the feasibility of establishing a civilian counterpart to the
Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Agency, which has funded
leading-edge research in computers and other areas.
   Instead, he urged better use of existing interagency groups to
derive greater benefit from the $65 billion a year that the federal
government is currently spending on research and development _
about $43 billion for defense programs and about $22 billion in the
civilian area.
   ``One of the luxuries we've had for the last 40 years is the
luxury of compartmentalizing our activities very tightly. This is
Defense (Department), this is Energy, this is Commerce and so on,''
Graham told a conference on federal science and technology policy.
   He noted that ``we've seen the difficulties that creates in such
areas as the FSX today, which had been an activity undertaken
largely for defense policy purposes by the U.S. government, while
there was a substantial component of industrial policy on the part
of the Japanese.''
   Graham was referring to a controversial project under which U.S.
and Japanese companies are to co-develop and co-produce the FSX
aircraft, an advanced version of the F-16 fighter, for deployment
by Japan in the late 1990s.
   A U.S.-Japanese agreement, signed late last year, had been
negotiated by the Pentagon and State Department. However, after the
Bush administration took office the deal came under criticism from
the Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, expressing concern that broader
economic issues had not been fully taken into account.
   As a result, the administration has requested ``clarifications''
from Tokyo before the FSX agreement is formally submitted to
Congress.
   Graham said the United States needs to look for opportunities
where defense spending substantially helps U.S. civilian industry,
comparable to the mid-1950s when the Boeing Co.'s building of
KC-135 military tanker planes led to its successful development of
the civilian 707 jetliner.
   ``Many more such opportunities exist in defense and other
sectors -- I believe many more than we're taking advantage of today.
   ``And I believe the overly rigid compartmentalization with which
we've viewed these (R&amp;D programs) institutionally, both in the
government and in industry, is limiting the benefits that we derive
from the $65 billion that the federal government invests each
year,'' he said.
   Graham, who became presidential science adviser in October 1986,
has stayed on at the White House pending the appointment of a new
adviser by President Bush.
   Asked how soon he believes a replacement will be named, Graham
said ``I've learned that it's always hazardous to second-guess the
president'' but added that ``I would be surprised if it's too much
longer.''
   He spoke at a science and technology policy colloquium sponsored
by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   The government said Thursday it has denied
U.S. export privileges to six Europeans in two separate export
control cases, one involving alleged illegal shipments to the
Soviet Union and the other related to the threat of illegal exports
to Bulgaria.
   In the first case, the Commerce Department issued orders denying
export privileges to Goran Josberg and his firms, Globe Trade,
Globe Computers and Globe Metals of Stockholm, Sweden, and to
Helmut Keck and his firm, OTC Mess-Und Videoteknik, GmbH, of
Hamburg, West Germany.
   Josberg's denial of export privileges extends for 35 years and
Keck's for 10 years, the agency said.
   Between 1983 and 1985, Josburg allegedly directed a conspiracy
in which Keck and others received sophisticated U.S. technology and
equipment through Keck's dummy corporations in West Germany, the
department said. The two then allegedly re-exported the technology
through Finland to the Soviet Union without authorization from the
Commerce Department.
   The equipment included a WAS-3000 airstream modulator that has
direct military applications because it is used to test missiles
and missile components, said Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary for
export administration.
   ``Some members of this high-tech diversion ring posed as
legitimate businessmen in Sweden, West Germany and Singapore to
acquire U.S.-origin technology for their carefully planned scheme
to supply highly sought-after, militarily useful items to East Bloc
countries,'' Freedenberg said.
   In the latter case, the Commerce Department issued a 180-day ban
on export privileges for four businessmen and their firms because
they were suspected of trying to obtain U.S.-origin equipment for
illegal export to Bulgaria.
   The order, effective April 6, covers Franciscus B. Govaerts and
his firm, Printlas Europa; Goris Christiaan Grandia and his firm,
Grandia Project Services; Marcel Sanders and his firm, Belgian
Trading Company Lokeren S.A. and Roger Van Alphen.
   The department alleged that Govaerts attempted to export a
memory test system and laser repair system to Grandia and Van
Alphen in the Netherlands by falsely describing the equipment on a
shipper's export declaration.
   Grandia and Van Alphen, with the help of Sanders, planned to
re-export the equipment to Grandia's customers in Bulgaria without
approval, the agency said. Sanders allegedly was to finance the
illegal purchase and shipment, Commerce said.
   Govaerts and Sanders were arrested on related charges in
December and are awaiting trial; Grandia was arrested in Italy and
has been released on bail pending extradition to the United States;
Van Alphen still is at large, the department said.

<HEAD>Air Force Still Confident About Cruise Missile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon said Thursday the Air Force is
still confident of the wartime abilities of its cruise missile,
even though charges filed this week against Northrop Corp. charge
the defense contractor falsified test data and installed defective
parts in the missile.
   Defense Department spokesman Fred S. Hoffman said Air Force
officials continue to believe the air-launched missile is ``mission
ready'' and added that ``any suggestion at this point that Northrop
may be suspended or dbarred is really speculative and premature.
...''
   The Navy and Air Force are following ``standard procedures'' for
dealing with contractors that have been indicted on federal
charges, the spokesman said. Under those procedures, special
administrative boards within the Navy and Air Force have requested
details of the Northrop indictment from prosecutors.
   At some point, the boards will decide if the allegations are
serious enough to warrant an immediate, temporary suspension of
Northrop's contracting rights.
   ``But that has not yet happened,'' Hoffman said.
   The aerospace giant and five current or former employees were
charged with conspiring to defraud the government in the
construction of part of the guidance system for the cruise missile
and in the building of a component of the Navy's Harrier attack jet.
   The allegations involving the missile were viewed as
particularly troubling, because that weapon is part of the nation's
nuclear arsenal. The 167-count indictment charged that Northrop and
the employees conspired to install parts for the missile's flight
data transmitter that failed to meet government specifications.
   Asked Thursday if the Air Force thought it could rely on the
weapon in view of the charges against Northrop, Hoffman noted the
allegations against the company first surfaced in 1987.
   ``And the Air Force ... has been taking a series of remedial
steps since then,'' he continued. ``So it is not something which
just burst on them. They were aware then and they have been taking
action.
   ``As things now stand, the Air Force has full confidence that
the air-launched cruise missile is reliable and capable of carrying
out its mission. According to the Air Force, it has a mission
readiness rate well within acceptable limits. That rate is 96
percent.''
   As for the AV-8B Harrier jump jet, flown by the Marine Corps,
Hoffman said the service had ``experienced higher-than-expected
failure rates over the life of the program'' for a flight sensor
assembly made by Northrop.
   ``However, the sensor involved is not essential for safe flight
and there have been no accidents nor any incidents, I'm told, that
can be attributed to the failure of this component,'' Hoffman said.
   Northrop is the nation's 32nd largest defense contractor, having
received contracts worth $532.6 million in fiscal 1988. The company
is a prime contractor on several key projects, however, including
the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Should either the Navy or Air Force impose a suspension on the
firm pending resolution of the charges, it would affect Northrop's
right to bid on and receive future contracts _ not those it already
holds.

<HEAD>Japan Charged With Destroying Rain Forests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan is speeding the destruction of tropical
rain forest in southeast Asia because of its demand for timber,
according to a report Thursday by the World Wildlife Fund, a
private environmental group.
   Co-authors of the report were Yoichi Kuroda, coordinator of the
Japan Tropical Forest Action Network, and Francois Nectoux, a
French economist who lectures at the South Bank Polytechnic in
London.
   ```South seas' tropical forests are being destroyed, for
ineffective plywood uses and even disposable chopsticks,'' said
Robert Buschbacher, director of the organization's forestry
program, in a statement.
   ``As forests are eradicated in Asia, Japan will look towards
South America _ specifically the Amazon _ to exploit.''
   The report, entitled ``Timber from the South Seas,'' said that
in 1987 Japan got 96 percent of its tropical hardwoods from Sarawak
and Sabah in Malaysia, and from Papua New Guinea. A statement by
the fund said some of the world's most biologically valuable
forests are threatened with destruction in Sabah and Sarawak, on
the island of Borneo.
   In the 1960s and 1970s Japan's hardwoods came mainly from the
Philippines and Indonesia, according to the report.
   A Japanese embassy official, who spoke on condition his name not
be used, questioned whether it took all the relevant facts into
account. He said Japan gives due consideration to environmental
matters in its import program. It is a big contributor to both the
United National Environmental Program and to the International
Tropicval Timber Organization in Yokohama, he added.
   According to the report, Japan has been the world's major
importer of tropical woods for nearly 20 years, taking about 2
billion dollars worth in 1986. It said Japan imports more than the
United States, and as much as the 12 countries of the European
Exconomic Community taken together.
   ``The time is ripe for many changes in Japan's relation towards
tropical forests,'' the report concluded. ``So far this
relationship has been mainly destructive.''
   It recommended a new policy to deal with both conservation and
Japan's timber needs, with increased aid for forest management,
concentration of imports on timber from areas where production can
be sustained, reduction of wasteful uses and substitution of
softwoods where hardwood is not necessary.

   Oliver North ended his testimony Thursday
after six grueling days on the witness stand, saying he became sure
he was being made the fall guy in the Iran-Contra affair when he
heard himself described at a White House news conference as ``the
only one who knew what was going on.''
   Attorney Brendan Sullivan later rested his case, having called
16 witnesses for the defense. Prosecutors, who called 29, said they
will have a few rebuttal witnesses on Friday.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he probably will give
the jurors Monday off while he decides what final instructions they
will be given. He said final arguments probably will take two days
and the case should go to the jury on Thursday, in the 12th week of
trial.
   During four days of tough cross-examination, North denied
prosecution contentions that he lied about his Iran-Contra efforts
and personally profited from some of them. He said he had explicit
authorization from his superiors _ and, he assumed, from President
Reagan _ for his actions and didn't take a dime he wasn't entitled
to.
   He testified Thursday that two days before the Nov. 25, 1986,
press conference, in which Reagan and Attorney General Edwin Meese
III took part, North had been interviewed for four hours by Meese
and aides.
   He is accused of lying during that interview. But he testified
he told them readily about ``the secret within the secret'' _ that
profits from arms sales to Iran had been funneled to the guerillas
fighting the leftist government of Nicaragua. Therefore, he said,
he was shocked to learn that he might be the target of a criminal
investigation.
   What he heard as he watched the press conference on television,
North said, ``was inconsistent with what I told the attorney
general two days before.'' Meese said North's boss, John
Poindexter, had known of the money diversion but hadn't approved it
_ when, in fact, he had.
   North testified, ``It was very clear to me that this was part of
pointing the finger at Ollie North. He was `the only one who knew
what was going on' _ which, I must say, is the way it was supposed
to be.'' North's firing and Poindexter's resignation as Reagan's
national security adviser were announced by Meese that day.
   Both at the trial, which began Jan. 31, and at congressional
hearings nearly two years ago, North said he had assumed while he
was directing covert aid to the Contras that he would have to take
the rap if word got out about the help, which was being provided at
a time that official U.S. aid was banned.
   Prosecutor John Keker's final questioning of North concerned two
letters he wrote in December 1986 to a contractor who had installed
a $13,800 security system at North's home. The letters were
backdated to make it appear North had intended to pay for the
system, which had been paid for by retired Maj. Gen. Richard
Secord, whom North had recruited to run the Contra supply effort.
The letters are the basis for one charge, that North accepted an
illegal gratuity.
   North was still in the Marine Corps, he said, and didn't want to
fabricate the letters at work because he didn't want the Marines
involved in ``that type of cover-up.'' Therefore, he testified, he
went to a catalog store to write the letters on display typewriters.
   Another of the 12 charges against North is that he obstructed a
presidential inquiry by lying to Meese and by altering, destroying,
concealing and removing documents from the National Security
Council office where he worked.
   Relying on notes taken at the Nov. 23, 1986, meeting by Meese
chief of staff John Richardson, Keker led North through facts that
appeared to have been omitted by him in the Meese meeting. North
said that the prosecutor was basing his questions on a ``very
cryptic description of four hours of conversation.''
   He said he could not remember details of the interview. But he
also said, ``I did the very best I could in telling the truth and
answering their questions. ... I have told you when I didn't tell
the truth.''
   A day before the Meese interview, a search of North's office had
uncovered a memorandum that spelled out the money trail from Iran
to Nicaragua.
   ``By golly, when it was raised I told them the truth,'' North
testified. ``When I got back to the White House I called to Admiral
Poindexter to tell him the secret within the secret was now known
to four other men.''
   The prosecution says North lied at the meeting about NSC
involvement in the diversion, about Israel's role and the
involvement of Secord.
   The 12 felony charges against him also include lying to and
obstructing Congress, converting Contra traveler's checks to his
own use and conspiring to defraud the Treasury and the Internal
Revenue Service.

   Christian and Moslem gunners pounded
residential areas Thursday, stalling the evacuation of wounded to a
French hospital ship as the bitter civil war that has claimed
150,000 victims entered its 15th year.
   Police said 19 people were killed and 50 wounded, raising the
toll to 215 dead and 727 injured since the artillery battle began
March 8 between the Christian army units of Gen. Michel Aoun and
Druse militiamen aided by Syrian soldiers.
   Thursday's day-long bombardment was the fiercest since April 5,
when the Arab League called for a cease-fire to halt the worst
sectarian fighting since 1985. The truce, like others in the long
war, soon failed.
   Artillery and rocket fire blocked plans to ferry Moslem and
Christian wounded by helicopter to a French hospital ship in
neutral waters off Beirut.
   ``The evacuation has been put off indefinitely,'' a police
spokesman said on condition of anonymity. ``We do not know how long
the French hospital ship will wait for security conditions to
permit patients to be flown to it.''
   He said a rocket barrage at midday hit the main power
distribution plant in Jamhour, a Christian suburb, blacking out
Beirut and the surrounding area.
   ``All power distribution operations for the capital and its
suburbs have come to a standstill,'' said Fares Dagher of Beirut's
electricity authority. ``We do not know when any repairs can be
done.''
   A spokesman for the Moslem cabinet of acting Premier Salim Hoss
said earlier a French navy tanker was ready to unload six tons of
fuel oil Friday at the Moslem terminal at Zahrani in south Lebanon
and at Zouk, a Christian harbor north of Beirut where the capital's
main power plant is located.
   Shelling of storage depots has nearly wiped out the fuel supply
and the power authority had said even the limited electricity
supplied to Beirut would stop unless stocks were replenished.
   Attilo Iannucci, the Italian charge d'affaires, said the Italian
ship Isola Azzurra was hit by a shell off Beirut port shortly after
sunup but no one was hurt. He said the vessel, carrying 4,000 tons
of sulfuric acid, headed for Cyprus for repairs.
   ``Four shells were fired, but the captain avoided three and only
one hit the back of the ship way above water level,'' Iannucci said
in an interview.
   Bernard Kouchner, France's minister for humanitarian assistance,
announced the plans for French helicopters to evacuate wounded
Lebanese to the hospital ship Rance.
   The minister, who arrived Tuesday, said Moslem victims would be
flown from west Beirut's Bain Militaire beach and Christians from
Jounieh, a Christian-controlled port 12 miles north of the city.
   He did not give the location of the Rance, which has 90 beds and
operating facilities. The Beirut newspaper As-Safir said it would
anchor between Moslem and Christian waters eight miles out.
   Beirut hospitals had not asked that the ship be sent from
France, which ruled Lebanon until independence in 1943.
   Medical sources said it was not needed to treat most of the
wounded but could be useful for acute and specialized cases, such
as victims needing artificial limbs or 24-hour care.
   A source in the Hoss cabinet said the Bain Militaire and Jounieh
port were ``repeatedly targeted by the shelling Thursday.''
   Hoss and Aoun, who commands the 20,000 Christians in Lebanon's
army, have led competing Moslem and Christian governments since a
political crisis arose in September.
   The artillery battle started two days after Aoun's forces
blockaded illegal militia-run ports that deprive the five
government ports of about $100 million a year.
   Lebanon's civil war dates from April 13, 1975, when Christian
gunman killed 29 Palestinians in a bus ambush after a prominent
member of the rightist Christian Phalange party was assassinated.
   The political crisis began when President Amin Gemayel's
six-year term ended and Parliament could not agree on a successor.
He appointed Aoun, his army commander, to lead an interim
government and Moslems swore allegiance to Hoss, the incumbent
premier.
   When competing governments emerged, the army also split on
sectarian lines. The 22,000 Moslem soldiers, led by Maj. Gen. Sami
Khatib, are poorly equipped and have stayed out of the fighting,
but help Syrian troops blockade Christian territory.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab league and has become the country's main
power broker in the chaos of civil war.

   A 5-year-old girl fell an estimated
25 feet from a Ferris wheel when it stopped abruptly, and fell into
her father's arms.
   ``The doctor said if I hadn't been there to break the fall she
could have died,'' Mack McAdams said of his daughter Rachel.
   ``There is a strong likelihood that her father prevented more
extensive injuries by catching her,'' Dr. Charles Schubert said.
   The ride had stopped and McAdams had just gotten off Wednesday
at a parking lot carnival with another daughter, 3-year-old Sarah,
and he was waiting for Rachel and sister Margot, 6, to get off.
   ``The machine just kicked itself on,'' said McAdams. ``In my
mind, it wasn't the operator. It was the machine.''
   Policeman John Nolte said the ride had stopped, the safety bar
across the seat was unfastened and the operator was preparing to
help Rachel out when the ride suddenly started.
   By the time the operator could stop it, Rachel and Margot were
25 feet in the air, McAdams said. When it stopped, Rachel lost her
balance and fell, but Margot held on until the operator brought her
down.
   Rachel glanced off another of the ride's cars and then her
father caught her for an instant before she hit the ground.
   The girl was treated at Children's Hospital Medical Center in
Cincinnati for head bruises and a broken tooth, officials said.
   The Ferris wheel is part of a carnival sponsored by shopping
center merchants. Carnival owner John Spaulding said he had never
had problems with the Ferris wheel, which he said was recently
inspected. The ride was closed until state inspectors can examine
it.

<HEAD>Syrian Helicopters Rocket Two Soviet Navy Ships</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Syrian helicopters rocketed two Soviet navy
vessels in the Mediterranean this week, injuring seven Soviet
sailors, one critically, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov reported Thursday.
   He said Syria apologized for the attack and that a preliminary
investigaton indicated the helicopter pilots attacked in error.
   The military newspaper Kraznaya Zvezda identifed the badly
wounded man as E. Shkitchenko and said, ``There is little hope to
save him.''
   Gerasimov told a news briefing the attack took place at 10 a.m.
Tuesday 35 miles off the Syrian port of Tartus.
   The Soviets have maintained military facilities at Tartus, where
two of the injured seamen were taken, since 1969.
   ``Two helicopters with Syrian markings attacked two Soviet
auxiliary vessels with rockets, namely a sea tugboat and a divers'
boat in the Mediterranean Sea,'' he said.
   Gerasimov did not say what type of helicopters were involved or
give details of the attack.
   According to an initial probe into the incident, the attack was
a result of ``erroneous actions of one of the Syrian helicopters,''
Gerasimov said.
   ``The Syrian side expressed regret at the accident and offered
its official apology.''
   He declined to say if the official apology was made in Moscow or
Damascus.
   The Soviet news media soft-pedaled the incident with Syria, its
staunchest ally in the Middle East. Damascus keeps close relations
with Moscow, its major arms supplier.
   The attack was first reported in a three-paragraph item in the
world news roundup of Krasnaya Zvezda on page three. The official
Tass news agency carried a two-paragraph dispatch on Gerasimov's
remarks. The government newspaper Izvestia did not mention the
incident.
   The submarine-tracking ship Kraszny Kavkaz and the cruiser
Leningrad, on a routine patrol in the eastern Mediterranean,
hurried to the aid of the attacked vessels, sea tugboat S.B.-524
and divers' boat-125, after the attack, according to the newspaper.
   Gerasimov said a joint investigation commission was set up to
determine why the helicopters attacked the Soviet vessels.

   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa said
Thursday he was being pressured to run for office but would only
want the newly created post of president of Poland.
   Also on Thursday, Solidarity filed an application to register as
a trade union after a seven-year ban. The application at the Warsaw
Regional Court follows the historic agreement reached April 5 by
the opposition and communist authorities to restore the union's
legal status and allow independent candidates to run for parliament
in June.
   Walesa said he expects Solidarity to be registered by Monday and
added: ``Delaying of our activities doesn't serve us and doesn't
serve Poland.''
   He said he was under heavy pressure to run in the elections,
which the government Thursday set for June 4, with run-off voting
on June 18.
   ``I'm being strongly pressed. Different people are pressing me
and I am thinking about being a candidate to the highest organ that
is going to be in Poland,'' Walesa said at a news conference in his
home city of Gdansk.
   Walesa said later in a telephone interview that he would not run
either for the newly created 100-member senate, which will be the
East bloc's first freely elected legislative chamber, or the
existing 460-member Sejm, where the opposition can run for 35
percent of the seats.
   But he said he might like to be a candidate for president when
the post next becomes available in six years, although he wouldn't
exclude his name from being put forward now.
   ``I am a man of big interests,'' said Walesa, an electrician who
won the Nobel Peace Prize for founding the East bloc's first
independent trade union during a 1980 strike at the Gdansk shipyard.
   Any citizen can be nominated for president by one-fourth of the
Sejm, as the existing parliament is called, and the senate. The
president will be jointly elected by the Sejm and the senate.
   The first six-year term is widely expected to go to Commmunist
Party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski due to the majority still
guaranteed to the Communist Party and its allies in the larger Sejm.
   Walesa, who has indicated a preference for concentrating on
union matters, did not say who was pressuring him to seek office.
But there have been suggestions he should run to set an example for
other opposition members who might be reluctant to replace election
boycotts with participation the communist-dominated government.
   The Roman Catholic church, with which Walesa and Solidarity are
closely bonded, has called on members in general to participate in
the election.
   Solidarity won't directly field candidates for the elections,
but said it will support those named by a Solidarity Citizens
Committee that was formally created on Saturday and is composed of
top union leaders and adivsers.
   The committee said it will put forward candidates for all 100
senate seats and the 161 freely contested Sejm seats. Solidarity
national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said the names of the
candidates will be presented by the end of April or early May.
   About 125 Solidarity leaders and advisers from across Poland
gathered in a crowded church hall Thursday to hear about the
election procedures agreed upon at the talks and start planning the
campaign.
   A Solidarity commission of eight key activists was formed to
direct the election efforts under Walesa.
   ``Solidarity plans to win these elections as much as is
possible. The elections will tell exactly who is right. I wish well
to all. Let the better win,'' Walesa said at the news conference.
   He entrusted the task of filing the union's charter in court to
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the opposition leader who negotiated trade
union freedoms in the talks with the government.
   Mazowiecki said the union had submitted the same charter it had
before Solidarity was banned after the December 1981 martial-law
crackdown.
   However, it contains a new section that suspends provisions
concerning strikes, in effect making Solidarity's charter adhere to
Poland's 1982 trade union law, which severely restricts the right
to strike.
   Walesa said he thinks there should be the right to strike, but
sticking stubbornly to the right to strike by an association is
``abnormal in abnormal times.''
   The new parliament is expected to revamp the trade union law,
possibly expanding the right to strike.
   Also on Thursday, Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski met
with Roman Catholic primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp to discuss
relations between the government and the church. They discussed
regulation of the legal status of the church, relations with the
Vatican, the outcome of the talks between the authorities and the
opposition, and upcoming elections, the state-run PAP news agency
said.
   Elsewhere in Warsaw, several hundred students marched to protest
conditions at the university library, and 1,500 elderly pensioners
gathered at the official union alliance seeking more benefits.
   Authorities proposed the talks on political and economic reform
in August 1988 at the peak of a nationwide wave of strikes in four
months. Walesa refused to participate until authorities agreed to
restore Solidarity's legal status. At a stormy plenum in January,
Jaruzelski pressed the Communist Party to accept a legal Solidarity
and the talks finally began Feb. 6.
   Authorities hope the restoration of Solidarity and opposition
participation in parliament will create a period of social calm to
give economic reforms designed to fight inflation, chronic consumer
shortages and a staggering foreign debt a chance.

   House Democrats, who re-elected Jim Wright as
speaker only four months ago, agonized Thursday over the prospect
that an ethics committee report might compel them to strip their
leader of his post.
   ``I think there's deep concern, both as to the person of the
speaker and the Congress itself,'' said Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich.
``Agony is probably the best word.''
   After a 10-month investigation, the ethics committee has found
reason to believe that the Texas lawmaker violated House rules in
receiving financial benefits from a Fort Worth developer who had an
interest in legislation, and that the speaker improperly sought to
evade limits on outside income with a book deal, according to
sources familiar with the probe.
   In a sometimes emotional defense Thursday, Wright denied
violating any rules and asked for a quick decision from his
colleagues.
   ``I will fight to the last ounce of conviction and energy that I
possess,'' Wright told reporters in the Capitol. ``I am confident
that in the 34 years I have served in the Congress I have not
violated any of those basic rules or any commonly accepted standard
of ethical conduct.''
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., who lined up behind Wright with other
House leaders and Texas lawmakers, said the speaker was being
``leaked to death'' and needed to respond.
   ``I don't think the question is survival,'' he said. Once the
public hears Wright's case, he said, ``I think they are going to
conclude that he's absolutely telling the truth.''
   The full House, not the committee, is the final judge. Democrats
fear they'll have to choose between jettisoning a leader who over
three decades climbed to the top of their ranks, and facing a
political fallout that could harm them all.
   ``There's sort of a foreboding here about what the Congress has
to confront. This is all precedent setting,'' said one Democratic
lawmaker, who like many of those interviewed, spoke on the
condition his name not be used.
   Never has a House speaker been removed. It is far from a
foregone conclusion that Wright will be the first.
   ``I think all that's premature,'' said Rep. Pat Williams,
D-Mont., a Wright ally, when asked to speculate how Democrats would
react to the ethics committee report, expected to be issued in the
next few days.
   Williams was among those who said Wright's future as speaker
would depend in part on whether the ethics committee recommends
punishment, such as a formal reprimand or censure. The committee
decides that issue after the speaker is given a chance to respond
to its charges.
   ``The ground would start to move under him if he were
reprimanded,'' Williams said.
   If the committee merely scolds Wright, he can survive, but if it
recommends a reprimand or the more severe act of censure, then
there would be ``no option'' but to remove Wright as speaker, said
another Democrat.
   The investigation against Wright was begun following a complaint
by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who has since risen to the No. 2
position among House Republicans.
   The GOP intends to make hay with whatever sunshine the committee
provides. House Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois said he
would use the rules to make sure that the full House votes on the
Wright matter regardless of what the committee recommends.
   Three House Democrats launched another part of the counterattack
in ``Dear Colleague'' letter Thursday, demanding that the Ethics
Committee publish only information related to the actual charges it
will level at Wright. Republicans had been pushing for a full
release of the special counsel's report, which contains material on
allegations rejected by the committee.
   ``Releasing the other material _ unsubstantiated charges,
rumors, innuendo and speculation _ on Speaker Wright would be a
terrible precedent for the House, threatens all members and makes a
mockery of fair play,'' said the letter from David Nagle of Iowa,
Bob Matsui of California and Jim Moody of Wisconsin.
   Undoubtedly, if Wright became a political liability for the
party, many Democrats would hope he'd leave quietly. But Wright
himself has indicated he won't easily give up the post that is the
pinnacle of his career.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said he believed Democrats will not
lightly discard their speaker for political advantage in their home
districts.
   ``I think people are less political than you sometimes think,''
he said.
   So far, lawmakers said they saw no sign that anyone was moving
against Wright in a power grab. ``I don't see any cannibalism going
on,'' said one.
   ``You have a person who has every right to be treated justly,''
Kildee said. ``I really think this is a very grave moral issue''
and, if a vote comes, each member will decide ``in the loneliness
of our consciences.''
   Several lawmakers expressed concern that the speaker was being
held up to standards that sometimes weren't clear and have changed
over the years.
   Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, said even members of the House
who have tried diligently to obey all ethical standards will wonder
whether they could have survived the same kind of million-dollar
investigation. He cited the familiar phrase about people who live
in glass houses.
   ``Most of us in the House are prepared to eat a steady diet of
glass for the next few weeks,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday
fired the defense minister and replaced seven other Cabinet
ministers in a long-awaited shake-up aimed at boosting his
government's appeal to voters.
   The reorganization appeared to be mostly a seat-swapping
exercise, with some important posts rotating among Kohl's closest
advisers and others going to political allies to ensure their
continued support.
   Kohl's Christian Democratic Union has suffered badly in recent
local elections, losing control of both the West Berlin and
Frankfurt city governments to a rival coalition of left-leaning
Social Democrats and environmentalist Greens.
   Kohl's party has been trailing the Social Democrats since the
first of the year in nationwide polls.
   Kohl said the changes were in preparation for next year's
federal election campaign and not a direct result of the Frankfurt
and West Berlin losses.
   ``I had planned this cabinet rebuilding long before that,'' Kohl
told a news conference.
   Also Thursday, Kohl indicated he planned a sharp change in the
nation's immigration policies by making it more difficult for
ethnic Germans to immigrate to West Germany.
   ``We are not of the view that immigrants from every region of
the world where there are Germans should all be able to come to
us,'' he said in an interview aired on ZDF television Thursday
night.
   Kohl has faced increasing criticism over the growing number of
ethnic German immigrants who compete with West Germans for scarce
housing and jobs.
   More than 200,000 ethnic Germans immigrated to West Germany in
1988, most of them from East bloc countries. It has long been
official government policy that ethnic Germans have a right to
immigrate to West Germany.
   The Cabinet appointments, effective April 21, replace Kohl's
chief of staff and the ministers for defense, finance, interior,
transport, economic cooperation, construction and information.
   He named Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg to head the
Defense Ministry. The ministry has been the target of public
criticism in the past year because of a string of deadly NATO jet
crashes and NATO plans to replace short-range nuclear missiles in
West Germany with rockets of a longer range.
   Kohl praised the outgoing defense minister, Rupert Scholz, who
he said was ``confronted with many problems for which he cannot be
made responsible.''
   Scholz, a former law professor, was appointed in May and had no
military experience. He was often left to publicly defend the
government's most controversial policies and absorbed the brunt of
criticism over NATO war games and noisy low-flying exercises.
   Stoltenberg became finance minister in 1982, when Kohl's party
joined forces with the liberal Free Democrats to wrest the
leadership from the Social Democratic Party.
   The Social Democrats declared the changes ``Kohl's Last Stand''
and ``blatant political tradeoffs.'' The Greens called them
``boring and desperate.''
   In addition to the change at the Defense Ministry, the most
significant appointment was the replacement of Stoltenberg with
Theo Waigel, head of the Christian Democrats' Bavarian sister
party, the Christian Socialist Union.
   Some government officials said privately the appointment was
demanded of Kohl to ensure the Bavarian party's continued loyalty.
   The Christian Socialist Union now holds six of the 19 Cabinet
posts. The Christian Democrats have nine and the Free Democrats
four.
   Finance officials said Waigel planned to repeal or sharply limit
a new 10 percent withholding tax that took effect this year and
drove some investments out of the country.
   In other changes:
   _ Friedrich Zimmermann switched from interior minister to
transport minister.
   _ Chief of Staff Wolfgang Schaeuble was promoted to interior
minister.
   _ Rudolf Seiters, head of the Christian Democrats' parliamentary
delegation, was named the new chief of staff.
   _ The current transport minister, Juergen Warnke, was appointed
to oversee international aid projects as minister for economic
cooperation.
   _ Hans Klein, the economic cooperation minister, became Kohl's
official spokesman and head of the federal Press and Information
Office.
   That post, currently held by Friedhelm Ost, will be elevated to
Cabinet level. Kohl said Ost resigned, but sources within the
federal government have said he was forced to leave.
   _ Construction Minister Oscar Schneider was assigned to oversee
the government's controversial national museum projects in Bonn and
Berlin.
   _ Gerda Hasselfeldt was named construction minister, boosting
the number of women in Kohl's Cabinet to three.

   The State Department's top official on Africa
on Thursday accused leaders of Namibia's SWAPO guerrillas of making
``a terrible decision'' in sending fighters on an armed incursion
that is threatening the U.S.-mediated peace accord in the region.
   Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, just back from an
emergency meeting with Cuban, Angolan and South African
representatives, said he thought the agreement that went into
effect April 1 was now back on track.
   The pact, which grants independence to Namibia from South Africa
and envisions a Cuban pullout from Angola, was threatened by an
incursion of 1,200 to 1,800 armed SWAPO guerrillas from their bases
in Angola.
   ``It's still fragile,'' Crocker said. But he added that he was
struck by ``the extent to which the Cubans want to salvage this
thing.'' Cuba has undertaken to remove an estimated 50,000 troops
from Angola by July 1991.
   Crocker said the United States believes South Africa too is
determined to implement the agreements.
   Crocker said ``it was hard to explain the motive'' for the
decision made by Sam Nujoma, the head of the Soviet-backed SWAPO
group, to violate the agreement, which calls for the guerrillas to
remain in Angola until May 15.
   ``It was a terrible decision from SWAPO's own point of view,''
Crocker told reporters. SWAPO sent 300 of its fighters ``to their
death'' in Namibia, he said, ``and I would have thought the
leadership has something to answer for.''
   More than 260 SWAPO guerrillas have been killed in fighting with
South African-led security forces since their incursion began April
1. Some observers have suggested that local SWAPO commanders
thought they could return to Namibia the moment the pact went into
effect.
   Nujoma said initially that many of the fighters were already in
Namibia and had not crossed from Angola. But the U.N. peacekeeping
force on the ground has refuted the claim. Although Nujoma has
called on his fighters to retreat to Angola, it was unclear
Thursday how many had complied.

<TEXT>
   Neighbors say the family of the suspected cult
leader implicated in a dozen gruesome slayings in Mexico followed
the Santeria religion and practiced animal sacrifices at their
suburban Miami home.
   But an anthropologist who studies Santeria, an Afro-Christian
religion, on Thursday discounted its role in the ritual murders
near Matamoros, Mexico.
   Santeria is a largely underground religion that melded the
beliefs of slaves from present-day Nigeria with Hispanic culture in
the Caribbean and parts of South America, said Mercedes Sandoval, a
professor at Miami-Dade Community College, who has studied Santeria
for nearly 40 years.
   She estimated as many as 25,000 people in South Florida are
Santeria followers, and they also can be found in New York, New
Jersey, California, Venezuela, Colombia and Spain.
   Blood from Santeria animal sacrifices can form an alliance with
gods of nature and protect the believers, a reason offered by
Mexican authorities as a motive for the killings at a ranch used by
marijuana smugglers, she said.
   Suspected cult leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo ``may have been
exposed to Santeria and other magical systems,'' Ms. Sandoval said.
``He probably was seeking assistance from magical systems to get
protection, and then he himself developed his own ritual.''
   Constanzo grew up in Dade County, west of Miami, in a
Cuban-American family that left headless chickens, geese and goats
_ animals used in Santeria rituals _ on doorsteps and street
corners in their middle-class neighborhood, said neighbors.
Constanzo lived in the area until 1984.
   But Ms. Sandoval said human sacrifice has never been a part of
Santeria practices. She noted Santeria symbols were present in the
farm shack where investigators believe the victims were killed, but
pictures also revealed symbols such as human skulls, used in the
practice of palo mayombe, a separate religion that has its origins
in the Congo.
   ``I think I saw an ochosi (on television reports on the
slayings). That's the god of hunting from West Africa. He is also
perceived as the god that owns the traps,'' she explained. ``Many
people who are in conflict with the authorities pray to him to get
them out of jail. That is a connection with Santeria.''
   ``Even people who practice palo mayombe don't kill,'' she said.
   Dr. Charles Wetli, Dade County deputy chief medical examiner who
has been studying Afro-Caribbean cults for more than 10 years,
agreed ``the basic tenets are not ones that encourage human
sacrifice.''
   Ms. Sandoval has contacted several Santeros, Santeria priests,
in the Miami area since the ritual aspect of the slayings became
known, but there was no indication Constanzo had been initiated as
a priest.
   She suspected Constanzo was dabbling in magical religions to
terrorize his followers as a way of controlling them.
   ``I think what we have here is a case of some very sociopathic
people ... that may have been exposed to Santeria or some other
magical system,'' Ms. Sandoval said. ``I think we are dealing with
a deranged person.''
   Willie Ramos of Miami, a Santeria priest who leads initiation
ceremonies for new priests, said he was infuriated by stories
linking the Mexican cult to the practice of Santeria, voodoo and
other rituals with a base in the Caribbean.
   ``He's had some sort of exposure to Santeria, I wouldn't deny
that, but I wouldn't say he's a Santeria priest,'' Ramos said of
Constanzo.
   Former neighbors recalled the Constanzos as Santeria followers
and referred to Constanzo's mother as a witch.
   ``They had sheep and chickens in the back yard,'' said Carmen
Reigada, another neighbor. ``They were troublemakers.''
   Norma Brito, who bought the Constanzo's house after a bank
foreclosed on it in 1984, said she found the remains of an altar
with candles, wax and fruit when she moved in.
   Law enforcement agencies in South Florida refused to say whether
any of Constanzo's relatives still live in the area.
   A warning that Constanzo mighting be heading for South Florida
is being read to Metro-Dade officers at roll calls, but ``at this
time we're not taking any active stance on it,'' said Detective
Marie Chaney.

<HEAD>Voluntary Standards Measure Clears Senate Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee on Thursday approved
legislation to give the television industry an antitrust exemption
to adopt voluntary standards on portrayals of violence and drug use
in TV entertainment programs.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee, on a voice vote, sent the
measure to the full Senate, where a similar bill has passed twice
only to die in the House at the end of previous sessions of
Congress.
   The bill, authored by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., was amended by
the committee to also give the broadcast and cable industries and
producers a three-year exemption, as with violence, to develop
standards on portrayals of drug use.
   Simon said there was ``overwhelming research evidence'' showing
a link between excessive TV violence and children's behavior. He
said he believed a way can be found for society ``to protect itself
against undue emphasis on televised violence.''
   ``It's time for the television industry to forge a partnership
with America's familieis to scale back the atmosphere of violence
that is erupting in our communities,'' he said.
   David Carle, an aide to Simon, said he hoped the change this
year in the chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee would
help the bill in the House.
   Then-Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., who had headed the panel until
he retired last year, may have been sensitive to opposition to the
bill by the American Civil Liberties Union, though he never
expressed it, Carle said.
   Barry Lynn, the ACLU's legislative counsel, blasted the bill
again Thursday following the committee vote. He called it ``a
wholly inappropriate and unconstitutional effort to shape the
content of American television.''
   ``There is nothing voluntary about guidelines which emerge from
a regulated industry after Congress has instructed it about
specific programming it finds objectionable,'' Lynn said. ``The
hearing record of two past Congresses is filled with evidence of
precisely what programs and images the supporters of this measure
want off the air, including professional wrestling, `Miami Vice'
and Saturday children's cartoons.''
   Lynn said the bill ``begins an endless cycle of Congress using
antitrust exemptions to supplant broadcasters and cable operators'
judgments about the images and ideas Americans view.''
   But Carle emphasized that any guidelines would be voluntary.
``No network or individual station would be forced to adopt the
standards if they were developed, but we believe they would,'' he
said.
   The National Association of Broadcasters did not have any
immediate comment on Thursday's action.
   Chris Dunn, general counsel to Simon, said the major television
networks and motion picture producers did not oppose the previous
bills. But the networks said before ``that they didn't feel it was
needed because they had standards and practices divsions,'' Dunn
said.
   But, Dunn said, ``those standards and practices staffs have been
cut way back'' in the past year. He said the networks had not taken
a position on the bill this year.
   Carle said the cable industry had been quite receptive to the
proposal. He said the Reagan White House had supported the bill,
``and we assume that will continue with the new administration.''
   Nunn said the exemption would apply to general antitrust laws
that would affect any industry. He noted that the Justice
Department in the 1970s had said the NAB's Television Code that had
influenced TV program content did not conform with antitrust laws
and it was abandoned by the industry.

   Authorities say they've worked out
appropriate punishment for a 12-year-old who took a horse from a
carriage service and took it for a 1{-hour joyride downtown.
   He'll spend some time shoveling out the stalls at the Orlando
Police Department's horse stables.
   ``Under this agreement, he'll be punished... but he won't go
away with a felony criminal record,'' Assistant Public Defender
Barry Hepner said Wednesday.
   The boy and a 10-year-old companion took the horse, Baldy, from
the Orlando Carriage Co. They fashioned a bridle from rope and rode
the gentle horse around the downtown area on March 11.
   The 10-year-old was released to his parents, but the older boy's
family couldn't be located. Later, it was determined that his
father lives somewhere in Texas and his mother reportedly is in
Orlando but has a drug problem, Hepner said.
   ``He's a good kid, and he's very polite and does well in
school,'' Hepner said. ``But he was really just abandoned.''
   A felony charge of grand theft was filed against the boy because
he had a previous arrest for petty theft. He stole a toy car from a
store before Christmas, and is to be sentenced on that charge in
May. The other boy was not prosecuted because of his age and lack
of a criminal record.
   The 12-year-old, who was not identified because of his age, is
now living in a county-operated children's home until officials
decide whether he should be returned to a family member, placed in
a foster home or adopted.

   An East German man slipped past
communist guards and over border fences into West Germany out of
loneliness for his wife who had defected earlier, officials said
Thursday.
   The escape occurred Wednesday night near the West German town of
Helmstedt, 95 miles east of Hanover, said West German border police.
   The East German told officials his wife had been living in West
Germany since deciding not to return to her communist homeland from
a visit, police said. Neither the man nor woman was identified.
   According to a statement, the escapee said he wanted to be
reunited with his wife and that he was ``having difficulties with
his employer and officials'' because of her defection.
   Police did not say how long his wife had been living in West
Germany.

<HEAD>South Africa Says SWAPO Withdrawal Deadline May Be Extended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa said Thursday it may
extend a deadline for guerrillas to report to U.N. checkpoints for
safe passage out of Namibia.
   By Thursday night, only five fighters of the South-West Africa
People's Organization had reported to U.N. assembly points to take
advantage of an offer to return safely to Angola, territorial
officials said.
   South Africa says about 1,900 guerrillas infiltrated northern
Namibia after April 1, when Namibia's transition to independence
from South Africa was to begin. It was also the day a cease-fire
between SWAPO and South African forces was to take effect.
   But over the next eight days, 263 guerrillas and 27 members of
the South African-led security forces were killed in fighting.
   South Africa's largest daily newspaper, The Star of
Johannesburg, reported that two guerrillas were killed late
Wednesday in a new clash, the first since the weekend. A police
spokesman, Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand, said he knew of no such
incident.
   U.N. investigators have supported South Africa's contention the
guerrillas violated a peace accord requiring they stay at Angolan
bases at least until May 15.
   U.N. and South African military officers have expressed concern
that few guerrillas will report to the U.N. checkpoints. An
undetermined number already have gone back into Angola on their
own, and police say others are likely to try to remain in Namibia
in civilian guise.
   The territorial police said they probably would begin tracking
down guerrillas if it appeared only a few had left by a Saturday
deadline.
   However, South African Foriegn Minister Pik Botha said Thursday
the deadline could be extended indefinitely.
   Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the U.N. contingent in
Namibia, said verification of SWAPO's withdrawal was a precondition
for restoring the truce that was supposed to start April 1.
   He said verification would be difficult because some guerrillas
were bypassing the checkpoints and because of uncertainty as to the
size of the original incursion.
   SWAPO's exiled president, Sam Nujoma, has called on his fighters
to withdraw, but he has not specifically advised that they report
to the checkpoints.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I. In December,
it agreed to begin a transition to independence in exchange for
Cuba withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola. SWAPO has
been fighting South African rule since 1966.

   The space program makes a profit, and people who
want it reduced in favor of more spending on food production and
housing are ignorant of its benefits, a Soviet scientist said
Thursday.
   Boris Chertok, a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said
the program cost $2 billion last year but earned more than $3.2
billion in satellite business and technology transfers. His remarks
were reported by the official news agency Tass.
   Calls for reductions in the space budget emerged during the
recent Soviet election campaign. They were brought up by official
media Wednesday in the context of Cosmonauts Day, the anniversary
of the first manned space flight, made 28 years ago by Yuri Gagarin.
   Recent setbacks in the Soviet space program encouraged the
demands for reductions. Tass said Wednesday the orbiting space
station Mir would be left unmanned for three months because of
delays in preparing research modules.
   Late last month, Soviet scientists lost contact with the second
of two Phobos probes sent to Mars at a cost of $480 million.
   Speaking at an Academy of Sciences convention, Chertok said
demands to divert money from space to food production and housing
reflect ignorance of the benefits space technology brings the
national economy.
   ``Space research performed the role of `locomotive' which was
blazing the way for other sectors,'' Tass quoted Chertok as saying.
``Were it not for cosmonautics, our lag in such fields as computer
engineering would have been much greater than now.''
   He said the Buran shuttle program, criticized as uneconomical,
would help civil aviation and computer technology. Chertok said its
safety systems could be applied in nuclear power engineering.

<HEAD>Sudanese Rebels Order Bombardment Of Juba Garrison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudanese rebels said Thursday they have
started shelling army garrisons in Juba, a city vital to a massive
U.N. emergency program to save 100,000 people from starvation in
the war-wracked south.
   However, relief officials in Nairobi said U.N. personnel
contacted by radio in Juba reported no shelling by Thursday
afternoon. The officials could not comment immediately on what
effect, if any, the rebel claim could have on the relief effort.
   In a broadcast monitored in Nairobi, the rebel Radio of the
Sudan People's Liberation Army said a long-range artillery
bombardment of army garrisons in Juba would last for four days. The
city is overcrowded with 300,000 residents and war refugees.
   Juba's airstrip is part of the ``corridors of tranquillity''
organized by the United Nations to stock 170,000 tons of food and
supplies in southern Sudan before seasonal rains make roads
impassable. U.N. officials warn that without such massive
intervention, 100,000 people could die of starvation.
   Juba, capital of Sudan's southernmost province of Equatoria, has
remained in government hands throughout the six-year war but
frequently has come under rebel fire. Rebels led by U.S.-educated
Col. John Garang have been tightening their siege of the city
throughout this year.
   Minority Christian and animist rebels took up arms against the
Moslem-dominated Sudanese government in 1983, demanding autonomy
and a larger share of Sudan's wealth and development for the south.
   They have shot down civilian and relief planes and attacked
truck, train and barge convoys, accusing the government of using
them to ferry supplies to troops.
   The international relief effort began April 1 after the Sudanese
government and the rebels agreed to let the emergency aid move
unhampered to rebel-controlled and government-held towns.
   Under the U.N. program, called Operation Lifeline, 108 tons of
food and supplies are being flown to Juba on six daily flights from
Entebbe, Uganda.
   Nils Enqvist, the Nairobi-based deputy coordinator of the
operation, said by Thursday afternoon he had heard no reports of
shelling from Juba. But, he said, if the rebels bombard Juba's
airstrip they will break their agreement to allow the $132 million
humanitarian effort to continue unhampered.
   Relief officials hope to avert a repat of the 1988 tragedy when
some 250,000 or more southern Sudanese died from starvation due to
flood, drought or war-induced famine.

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops stormed into
a West Bank village before dawn Thursday in a search-and-arrest
raid, triggering one of the bloodiest clashes in the 16-month
Palestinian uprising. At least five Arabs were reported killed and
dozens wounded.
   Elsewhere, 16 Palestinians were wounded by gunfire in
confrontations with soldiers, including five shot in Bethlehem
riots to protest the death of a teen-ager who was wounded last
week, hospital officials said.
   In Jerusalem, Arab witnesses said riot police fired tear gas
into the grounds of the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques, where
about 300 worshipers had gathered for evening prayers. Two
worshipers were slightly injured, Dr. Walid Elayan reported at
Mukassed Hospital.
   Mosque guard Abu Ahmed said police entered the walled compound
to make arrests. He said worshipers heard about the raid and ran
into the mosque courtyard chanting ``Allahu Akbar,'' Arabic for
``God is great.'' Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, he
said.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said he was checking the report.
   A riot occurred in the mosque complex last Friday, first day of
the Moslem holy month of Ramadan. Thousands of worshipers stoned
police, who replied with tear gas and rubber bullets. More than a
dozen people were hurt.
   Thursday's violence came as Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
concluded a 10-day visit to the United States, where he proposed to
President Bush that elections be held in the occupied territories
as a step toward peace.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the West Bank army commander, told
reporters he ordered an investigation into the incident in Nahalin,
about six miles southwest of Bethlehem.
   He said about 30 border police entered Nahalin to search for
Palestinians who were ambushing passing Jewish cars. They
encountered ``exceptional violence'' from about 100 Arab youths,
Mitzna said.
   Mitzna put the death toll at four and said at least 11 other
Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds in Nahalin.
   Arab villagers who showed an Associated Press reporter fresh
graves in the neighboring village of Hussan said a fifth person
from Nahalin was shot and killed in Hussan as he was driving to the
funeral of the four slain residents.
   An Arab doctor in the village said six died. The report could
not be confirmed by the army or hospitals.
   Doctors in hospitals said dozens of villagers were treated and
released. Fifteen were admitted, two in critical condition with
head wounds.
   Two hours of hit-and-run, stone-throwing attacks in Bethlehem
were sparked by the overnight death of 17-year-old Daoud Khaled
Nasser. He was wounded April 6, the day reporters saw soldiers open
fire without warning on fleeing protesters in apparent violation of
army regulations.
   His death and the five in Nahalin raised to 429 the number of
Palestinians killed since the uprising against Israeli rule began
in December 1987. Eighteen Israelis also have died.
   A curfew was clamped on Nahalin, a valley hamlet of about 2,000
people. Reporters were barred from entering.
   Mohammed Mustafa, 59, a farmer from Nahalin interviewed at
Mukassed hospital, said, ``It was a massacre.'' He added: ``The
army came to kill. They fired indiscriminately.''
   Israeli troops often raid before dawn to catch villagers by
surprise, but advancing border police were detected in Nahalin
where Moslems had arisen for a pre-dawn meal and prayers before the
daylong Ramadan fast, villagers said.
   Mohammed Ali, a teacher from Nahalin whose cousin was among
those killed, said about a dozen jeeps of border police troops
tried to enter the village about 4:30 a.m. He said village youths
blocked the roads with stones and threw rocks at soldiers, who
circumvented the barricades and entered on foot.
   ``Border police got on the roof and fired down on the people,''
Mohammed Ali said as he waited for neighbors being treated at Beit
Jalla Hospital. ``That's why there were so many head and chest
wounds.''
   Some villagers suggested Jewish settlers were involved in the
shooting, but Ali said he saw no civilians.
   The Nahalin death toll was the highest in a single incident
since Dec. 16, 1988, when four Palestinians died in clashes that
broke out at a funeral for a slain Palestinian in the West Bank
city of Nablus. Four other Palestinians died later of wounds
suffered at the funeral and subsequent clashes, since named ``Black
Friday'' by the Arabs.
   The highest single-day toll was 17 deaths recorded on April 16,
1988.

   Gina Marie Sisco has to work harder

   Bush stopped his motorcade near the Hamilton School on his way
to a conference of educators at nearby Union High School. Gina
Marie, who was among more than 400 flag-waving students watching
the motorcade, got a presidential hug and some words of
encouragement.
   In a letter to the president, Gina Marie had invited Bush to the
school to see how the district helps its disadvantaged students.
   ``I am a resource room student for math and English. I have a
learning disability. There are many kids like me and we all have to
work harder than most kids,'' she wrote.
   Bush later referred to his unannounced encounter when he spoke
to students from Union and Paramus schools and national educators.
   ``It's excellence and it's hard work,'' he said of her studies.
   ``It was a very moving experience for the youngster; she was
crying,'' said Guy Barbato, assistant superintendent of schools for
Union. ``It couldn't have happened to a nicer youngster.''
   Barbato said Gina Marie, who since kindergarten has had a
learning disability in math and English, decided on her own to
write the president and was encouraged by teachers at her school.
Barbato said he expects her to succeed in school.
   ``I think she'll not only function normally, but because of her
attitude she's going to be successful in her future life,'' Barbato
said.

<HEAD>Imported Eggs Restricted After Organism Discovered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Immediate import restrictions have been
ordered on eggs from countries where a food poisoning organism,
salmonella enteritidis, has been found in poultry, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   The organism, also known as phage-type 4 bacterium, has not been
detected in the United States or Canada, said Larry B. Slagle,
acting administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service.
   But it has recently been identified as ``the cause of numerous
outbreaks of salmonellosis in poultry in some areas of Europe,
including the Balkan countries and the Iberian Peninsula,'' he said.
   ``It has become the major sources of salmonellosis (food
poisoning) in humans in England and Wales,'' Slagle said. ``It is
known to be spread by poultry and poultry products, including
eggs.''
   M.A. Mixson, another agency official, said he had no estimate of
how many countries will be affected. In any case, he said,
relatively few eggs are imported into the United States, so the
U.S. restrictions ``will have little impact.''
   In humans, Slagle said, the salmonella bacteria can cause
stomach cramps, diarrhea, fever and sometimes nausea and vomiting
from five to 72 hours after they eat contaminated food.
   Slagle said the USDA agency restrictions mean that eggs may be
imported only if they meet certain conditions to ensure that they
are free of diseases and if they are accompanied by a certificate
which identifies the flock and country of origin, the ports of
embarkation and arrival, and the name and address of the exporter
and importer.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney general would define the scope of
an independent counsel's investigation and could intervene in court
on legal issues under changes in the law proposed by President Bush.
   Besides extending the independent counsel statute to members of
Congress as well as high executive branch officials suspected of
wrongdoing, the proposals contain a number of changes in the
special prosecutor law.
   Bush's proposal would eliminate a controversial requirement that
independent counsels issue reports detailing their decisions not to
prosecute an official under investigation _ such as the lengthy
document issued last year on then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   James C. McKay, the independent counsel who decided not to bring
charges last year against Meese drew criticism in legal circles
when the special court released his highly critical report of the
attorney general.
   Bush's plan would also empower the attorney general to ``define
the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel'' without
any approval from the court that appoints the prosecutors,
according to a White House analysis of the proposals that was
released Wednesday.
   Under the current law, the attorney general submits a proposed
mandate to the special court, which has the power to widen or
narrow it.
   In the case of the Iran-Contra independent counsel, the special
court conferred a broader jurisdiction in its appointment of
Lawrence E. Walsh than was sought in late 1986 by Meese.
   Meese's application called for an independent counsel to examine
the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits.
   Following a request from several members of Congress, the
special court issued a mandate that permitted Walsh to delve into
the full range of secret support the Reagan administration had
given the Nicaraguan rebels at a time such aid was barred by
Congress.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of the citizen lobby group Common
Cause, said this proposal ``kind of cuts back on the basic purpose
of the statute which was to get this outside of the ability of the
Justice Department to control the investigation.''
   Patti Goldman, an attorney for Public Citizen Litigation Group,
which supported the independent counsel when it was reviewed by the
Supreme Court last year, also criticized the proposal.
   Empowering the attorney general to set the jurisdiction ``gives
him control to keep the independent counsel from looking into
certain related things,'' Ms. Goldman said.
   Wertheimer predicted the proposals wouldn't ``be given serious
consideration in Congress,'' which voted in late 1987 to
reauthorize the law for five years.
   Under the Bush proposal, the special court would choose an
independent counsel from a list of 15 ``qualified prosecutors''
submitted by the attorney general. It has authority to appoint any
qualified attorney under the current law.
   The proposal would include a provision ``that the independent
counsel does not have authority to act for the attorney general
with respect to any matter which by law requires the persona action
of the attorney general,'' according to the White House summary.
   It also empowers the attorney general or the solicitor general
to intervene ``to address a matter of law'' in a case involving an
independent counsel rather than as a friend of the court.
   In the early stages of the Oliver North trial, U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ruled that the independent counsel _ not
the attorney general _ could speak for the Bush administration in
court on national security matters.
   Gesell rebuked the Justice Department for trying to intervene,
saying they could only the independent counsel could represent the
government in the case.
   Wertheimer and Goldman both defended the reporting provision of
the current law, saying it ensures accountability to both the
special court and the public.
   The reports are necessary, Wertheimer said, ``because we are
dealing with special circumstances... including the public
credibility of the investigation.''
   The White House summary said eliminating the reporting provision
would protect an official under investigation ``from unwarranted
speculation about crimes for which he or she will not be indicted.''
   This provision ``is consistent with longstanding prosecutorial
practice'' in which ordinary federal prosecutors do not explain
their decisions not to bring criminal charges.

<TEXT>
   Charles Lewis, a friend of Mayor Marion Barry
Jr., was indicted Thursday on seven counts of perjury and three
counts of cocaine possession stemming from an investigation into
Barry's visits to his hotel room last December.
   In the 10-page indictment, Lewis, a former District of Columbia
and Virgin Islands government employee, was charged with lying to a
federal grand jury about whether he possessed cocaine when Barry
visited him Dec. 22. Lewis is also charged with lying about using
cocaine with two separate individuals on Dec. 21, a day on which
Barry twice visited him.
   The federal probe began after city police on Dec. 22 were
inexplicably called off an attempt to make an undercover drug
purchase from Lewis, 48, after Barry showed up at his hotel room.
Barry has acknowledged contacting police officials looking into the
affair but has said he was only trying to speed up the probe.
   Lewis also is facing cocaine charges in the Virgin Islands.
   Federal investigators are also looking into Lewis' role in
coordinating a $260,000 joint project involving the city and Virgin
Islands governments. Lewis was fired from the project, which was
supposed to revise the islands government's personnel policies and
procedures, a year ago amid concerns about cost overruns.
   One of the perjury charges alleges that Lewis lied about whether
he possessed cocaine on Dec. 22, a day that Barry has acknowledged
visiting Lewis' room.
   ``That is the date...that the mayor was present at the Ramada
Inn,'' said U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens. Stephens also suggested
investigators will expand their probe into the events surrounding
those visits.
   Lewis also was indicted for lying about whether he bought from
or used drugs with two companions on Dec. 21. Barry reportedly
visited Lewis' room twice on that day.
   Barry, who has described Lewis as a friend, had no comment on
the indictment. He learned of the indictment while testifying on
the city's drug problem before a House District of Columbia
Committee panel.

<TEXT>
   Nobody expects a high school gym to smell
like a rose garden, but the locker room in one Jackson school is so
wilting it drove some students to picket.
   ``Cure That Smell,'' one student's sign read. Another
proclaimed: ``Brinkley Gym Stinks _ We Need Help Now, Not Later.''
   The six Brinkley Junior High students who picketed Wednesday
morning were ordered by Assistant Principal Charles Borden to
either return to class, go home or face police, said 15-year-old
Alisha Smith, a ninth-grader.
   ``We feel like what we are doing is right,'' Smith said as the
group headed away from the school.
   While students are worried about scents, school administrators
are holding their breath over the dollars they may have to spend to
deodorize the school.
   They say the area's troublesome Yazoo clay is shifting the
foundation and causing sewer pipes to emit foul odors.
   ``The sewage gas is being trapped and is coming back into some
of the drains _ particularly in the girl's dressing room area of
the gym and, to some extent, some of the science labs,'' said
Reuben Dilworth, assistant superintendent for Jackson's junior high
schools.
   Engineers hired by the school district are examining the pipes
and will make recommendations, Dilworth said. Crews also are
checking to see if the foundation is damaged, and the state
Department of Health said it is testing water samples from the
campus as a precaution.
   Principal Charles Tillman said female students aren't being
asked to don gym uniforms because of conditions in their locker
room.
   The aroma has been noticeable for weeks, the students said, but
became unbearable Wednesday.
   ``You can walk down the hall and in the cafeteria, and when you
go to biology, nothing but gnats fly up your nose when you sniff,''
said Patricia Stubbs, a ninth-grader who joined the student picket
line.

   President Bush said Thursday that Saudi Arabia
does not possess nuclear, chemical or biological warheads for
intermediate-range ballistic missiles purchased from China.
   If Bush had found otherwise, the administration would have been
barred from selling certain military products to the Saudis.
   In a formal presidential certification, Bush said the Saudis
have bought intermediate-range missiles from China but ``there is
no credible intelligence reporting indicating that Saudi Arabia
possesses nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.''
   Moreover, he said ``we are not aware'' of production facilities
for chemical or biological agents or weapons. He said the Saudis
possess ``no significant nuclear facilities.''
   A law enacted by Congress requires the president to make a
certification about the Saudis' arsenal in order to continue
military sales.
   Bush said that both the Saudis and Chinese have informed the
United States the missiles purchased from Beijing will not be
equipped with nuclear warheads.
   The Saudis also have pledged the missiles will not be armed with
chemical warheads, Bush said.
   ``We remain concerned about the possible proliferation of these
types of weapons in the Middle East and will continue to watch
developments closely,'' Bush said. He promised to notify Congress
of any change in developments in Saudi Arabia.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's nominee as ambassador to
Japan on Thursday denied assertions in the Iran-Contra trial that
he took part in a 1985 meeting where it was decided to reward
Honduras for backing the Contra guerrillas.
   A document released in the Oliver North trial said that Michael
H. Armacost, undersecretary of state in the second Reagan
administration, attended a meeting of a crisis pre-planning group
at the White House on Feb. 7, 1985, at which it was decided to
release military aid to Honduras in return for that nation's
continuing backing for the Contras.
   ``I read that ... in the paper with utter bewilderment,''
Armacost told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on his
nomination as ambassador to Tokyo.
   ``I did not attend that meeting on the 7th of February at the
White House. I am unable to reconstruct what they are talking
about,'' said Armacost.
   The Feb. 7, 1985, meeting had not been disclosed in
investigations of the Iran-Contra affair until the introduction at
the North trial of a 42-page admission of quid pro quo arrangements
that the Reagan administration reached with other countries.
   Evidence previously disclosed in the Iran-Contra investigations
said that Armacost and then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz had
raised objections to the secret sale of arms to Iran.
   North, a fired White House aide, is on trial for his role in
arranging the arms sale to Iran and diverting the profits to the
Contra guerrillas, who were battling the leftist government of
Nicaragua.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who presided over the Armacost
hearing, asked Armacost to respond in writing to information on his
role that was contained in the document that the Bush
administration submitted as stipulated evidence in the North trial.
   Bush last week refused to comment on another portion of the
document that said he informed the Honduran president, Roberto
Suazo Cordova, that then-President Reagan had directed expedited
delivery of U.S. military items to Honduras in 1985.
   Bush's meeting took place shortly after Reagan approved slipping
more than $100 million in extra aid to Honduras in exchange for
that country's support of the Contras.
   Cranston said he expected the committee to approve Armacost's
nomination and send it to the floor of the Senate for a vote before
Congress enters a recess next Wednesday.

<HEAD>Moore Sees Shoreham and Seabrook as Solution to Projected Shortages</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firing up the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long
Island and the Seabrook facility in New Hampshire would be a
solution to projected power shortages in the Northeast, an Energy
Department official said Thursday.
   Deputy Secretary W. Henson Moore of the Energy Department,
testifying before the Senate Energy Committee on the electricity
supply and demand outlook for the Northeast, said that ``we're
holding two birds in our hands and we're about to let them go in
hopes of finding one in the bush.''
   Moore called New England's energy outlook troubling ``because
reserve margins there could fall below acceptable levels as early
as 1993 if the recent robust demand growth continues.''
   ``If either demand growth exceeds projections as it has over the
last two years or if new capacity, including Seabrook, does not
come on line as planned, the situation in New England will be
exacerbated and reserve margins could fall below acceptable levels
as early as 1991 or 1992,'' he said.
   The energy situation in New York is generally good with the
exception of Long Island, he added.
   ``If (the Long Island Lighting Co.'s) peak demand grows by 4
percent this year, as it has averaged for the past six years,
LILCO's reserve margin would fall below 18 percent this year,'' he
said.
   But Peter Bradford, chairman of the New York State Public
Service Commission, testified that Shoreham ``would not have been a
great asset to the Long Island power supply situation in the near
future.''
   ``The fairest summary seems to be that if Shoreham ran well and
if oil prices rose rapidly, there might come a time when in the
next century it would be to the customers' net economic
advantage,'' he said. ``On the other hand, if oil prices remain
stable in real terms and Shoreham performs as erratically as many
nuclear plants, it would never be an asset economically on Long
Island.''
   Moore said the Energy Department would do everything in its
power to block the decommissioning of the Shoreham plant.
   ``We intend to throw up every roadblock we can find to do it,''
Moore said after the hearing. ``And if we have to create some,
we'll do that.''
   Asked what the department had in mind, he said, ``We don't know.
We're still looking at those opportunities, those alternatives. We
think it would just be foolhardy'' to decommission it.
   Moore said he'd rather see the $5.4 billion plant mothballed so
Shoreham will have another chance to operate later.
   ``When all the political rhetoric has died down and all the
hyper-opponents of nuclear power have gone their way and found some
other plant to demonstrate against, they'll start relooking at
those things and they will decide and tell their public officials
they'd like to have a reconsideration of this decision,'' Moore
told reporters.

<TEXT>
   Ecology and politics shared the stage
Thursday as participants in a symposium on the future of
Yellowstone National Park that rekindled the debate that arose
during the historic fires of 1988.
   The fires that charred about 1 million acres of the nation's
first national park drew attention to the shortcomings of
management plans in the park and surrounding national forests.
   ``The attention of the world conservation community is focused
on the park,'' Yellowstone Superintendent Bob Barbee told the
participants in the University of Wyoming conference.
   His goal is to develop a more ambitious control of the ecosystem
to oversee both the park and the forests.
   Barbee said the managers of the Greater Yellowstone area must
concentrate on protecting the area's natural resources while
maintaining the economic activities in the forests.
   ``These are easy things to say. They're hard things to
achieve,'' Barbee said. ``Our job is to cast a vote for posterity.''
   He noted that this week's conference may not offer any
solutions. About 300 people from across the nation came to Wyoming
to present research papers, debate and listen to speakers.
   Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan started the discussion on a political
note.
   He said cooperation among state and federal agencies in managing
and promoting Yellowstone is being sorely tested by a Bush
administration proposal to fund last summer's firefighting efforts
with the state's share of federal mineral royalties.
   ``Bluntly stated, this idea is feudalism and not federalism.
Western states are not vassals on some vast medieval estate owned
by absentee landlords in Washington, but this proposal would treat
us as such,'' Sullivan said.
   The governor said he has urged this ``ill-conceived idea'' be
reconsidered.
   Brian Stout, supervisor of the Bridger-Teton National Forest,
agreed that state officials need to be more involved in planning
the future of the Greater Yellowstone area.
   He said the many different demands on the federal land in
northwestern Wyoming make it tough to plan ahead.
   ``It is the diversity of demands upon this that are creating the
conflicts,'' Stout said. ``Conflicts aren't going to go away
because we are not creating any more acres.''
   Stout said he does not agree with some groups that say the
Yellowstone area should have one management plan. Currently there
are many government mandates controlling the use of public land in
the area.
   Stout said diversity is necessary because the variety of land
demands different management plans. Strong coordination efforts
will be the key to better management, he said.
   Last summer's fires brought the world's attention on the fact
that coordination has not been as effective as it should be, Stout
added.

<HEAD>Baker Says U.S. Will Continue Dialogue with PLO</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with senators' letter to Baker, subbing 4 grafs for

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Thursday that the United States will continue its dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization despite statements by some PLO
elements which appear to challenge Israel's right to exist.
   He also told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that the
willingness of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to consider
holding elections in occupied Palestinian territories, followed by
negotiations leading to a permanent settlement, is a new and
hopeful idea which should be fully explored.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., read several recent statements by
PLO officials which he said seemed to suggest they remain committed
to the creation of a Palestinian state and the destruction of
Israel.
   ``Statements such as those are clearly not helpful,'' Baker
said. ``We do look at statements such as that very carefully
because we want to continue the dialogue with the PLO under the
conditions under which they were started.''
   But he said that the PLO is composed of ``many dissident
elements, some of which are opposed to any dialogue with the United
States and some which have not renounced terrorism.''
   ``To date we are satisfied that the PLO is committed to what it
has told us, that it recognizes Israel's right to exist and that it
has renounced terrorism in all of its forms,'' Baker said.
   Baker said Shamir's willingness to hold elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza to choose representatives to open
negotiations with Israel is ``new, different and significant.''
   He also noted that Shamir said all options would be considered
in the structure of transitional and permanent arrangements.
   ``We think this is progress,'' Baker said. ``It is a useful
first step. It should be explored. It should not be rejected
categorically out of hand.''
   He said the United States will encourage Shamir, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein to preserve
flexibility ``so that the options may be explored and if possible
capitalized upon.''
   ``Elections are an important political act that can launch a
process leading to negotiations on both transitional and final
status issues,'' Baker said.
   Responding to questions, Baker said it would be difficult to
conduct elections if the violence associated with the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories continues.
   ``Surely there has to be a greater degree of calm or tranquility
before you get to elections,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, 38 senators told Baker in a letter that they would
seriously consider withholding U.S. financial support for the
United Nations if the PLO were recogized as a ``member-state'' by
the world body.
   The senators told Baker they viewed such a move with alarm and
that it `'sets the stage for continued stalemate'' on the
Arab-Israeli issue.
   The group, led by Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., urged Baker
to ``use every means at your disposal'' to discourage the drive.
   Elsewhere Thursday, Israel and the PLO jockeyed for position,
with Shamir refusing to follow Palestinian official Nabil Shaath in
appearances before a meeting of American newspaper editors. So,
organizers changed the schedule, with Shamir speaking first, and
Shaath's appearance was delayed.
   Shaath, political adviser to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, told
the editors he did not mind appearing after Shamir.
   Shaath said the U.S.-PLO dialogue demonstrated ``close
proximity'' in their positions. Shaath said the PLO has accepted
that a Palestinian state would consist only of the West Bank and
Gaza, adding that ``it's a bitter pill for us'' but a concession
that Israel should accept.
   As for Shamir's proposal for elections, Shaath called it ``an
exhilirating idea'' for Palestinians but he rejected any elections
which would bar PLO participation and be held under Israeli
occupation.
   Shamir, asked whether he would allow international supervision
of such elections and would let PLO members hold office if elected,
said such issues would have to be worked out by a ministerial
committee he sted the PLO had not relinquished a dream of
eventually setting up a state that would include Israel itself,
saying Shaath and other PLO leaders were conciliatory and moderate
when dealing with Westerners but take a hard line when speaking to
the Arab world. ``Maybe they want peace, but not with us,'' he said.
   Baker's chief deputy, meantime, told a Jewish audience the PLO
may be sincere in its declaration that it no longer seeks to
destroy Israel.
   ``The evidence is mixed,'' Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger told leaders of the United Jewish Appeal.
   ``Historically there can be no issue that was the object of the
PLO,'' he said.
   ``At the moment the jury is out,'' Eagleburger said, when asked
at a luncheon whether he believed statements by Arafat in December
that the organization supported Israel's right to exist.
   ``There are questions that need to be answered, it is no longer
clear in either direction,'' said Eagleburger, traditionally a
strong supporter of Israel.
   Eagleburger also said the United States was ``not trying to
mediate between the PLO and Israel.'' Discussions with the PLO, he
said, are an attempt to encourage Arafat's organization ``to take
constructive steps to allow a process between Israel and
Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza to develop.''
   ``We will get a better fix'' on the PLO's intentions, he said.

<HEAD>IRA Man Extradited by Helicopter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who escaped from the Maze
prison in a 1983 IRA breakout was extradited from the Irish
Republic to Northern Ireland by helicopter Thursday to avoid an
anti-extradition protest at the border.
   An Irish Republican Army statement took responsibility for a car
bomb that exploded next to a police station this week, killing a
woman, and said the explosion may have been premature.
   Paul Kane, 34, was only the fifth man extradited from the
republic to Northern Ireland since the IRA began fighting in August
1969 to unite the predominantly Protestant British province with
the republic, which is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.
   He was driven in a police convoy from top-security Portlaoise
prison, 50 miles from Dublin, to the Irish Army's Curragh camp and
taken by army helicopter to within a mile of the border. He was
quickly transferred to a Northern Ireland police helicopter, which
flew him to Belfast.
   Kane was charged Thursday night in Belfast Crown Court with
escaping from the Maze and other crimes.
   The helicopter transfer enabled police to avoid 200
anti-extradition campaigners who waited at the border for more than
24 hours to protest. Members of Sinn Fein, the legal wing of the
outlawed IRA, demonstrated at Portlaoise as Kane was driven away.
   He was arrested in the republic in November 1987 and had
resisted British attempts at extradition. Kane was serving 18 years
for IRA activities after conviction on the evidence of an informer,
Christopher Black.
   When the convictions resulting from Black's testimony were
quashed after the Maze breakout, Kane claimed he had been wrongly
imprisoned but he still faced the escape charge.
   He was one of 38 men who fled the Maze on Sept. 25, 1983. A
guard was stabbed to death and another was shot and seriously
wounded.
   In its claim of responsibility for the Wednesday bombing, the
IRA offered ``sincere apologies'' to the family of 20-year-old
Joanne Reilly, a Roman Catholic killed by the explosion in
Warrenpoint, less than a mile from the border.
   Miss Reilly worked in a hardware store next to the police
station and was hit with the full force of the bomb, which wounded
31 civilians and nine police officers. Police said they believe it
contained 1,500 pounds of explosives.
   Officials said more than 2OO homes were damaged.
   The IRA killed 18 British army soldiers in an ambush outside
Warrenpoint on Aug. 27, 1979. That same day, an IRA bomb on his
yacht killed Lord Louis Mountbatten, India's last viceroy and a
cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.

   The average American will have to labor 124
days this year just to pay federal, state and local taxes, reaching
``Tax Freedom Day'' on May 4, the Tax Foundation said Thursday.
   That is the same number of days of work required to meet tax
obligations in the last two years _ and the same as in 1981, when
across-the-board cuts in federal taxes were enacted. Tax Freedom
Day has never been later.
   From another perspective, the ``average'' worker will have to
toil two hours and 43 minutes each eight-hour day to satisfy the
tax collectors, one minute more than last year.
   ``Americans ... are no better off than they were in 1981,
despite economic growth, cuts in income tax rates and repeated
claims that government spending has been cut to the bone,'' the
foundation said.
   Economists at the foundation, a Washington-based non-partisan
research organization, attributed the lack of progress to:
   _The 1986 Tax Reform Act, which took away or reduced several
deductions to finance lower rates, and tax increases enacted in
1982 and 1984. Although the big 1986 overhaul meant lower rates for
most individuals, in many cases the reduced rates were more than
offset by loss of deductions.
   _Social Security taxes have grown faster than the economy in the
1980s. In 1981 a worker paid Social Security tax of 6.65 percent of
the first $29,700 earned, or a $1,975 tax. This year, the tax is
7.51 percent of the first $48,000, or a maximum $3,605.
   _State and local taxes have risen steadily through the decade,
in part to pay for a reduction in federal programs.
   Meantime, a group opposing any excise-tax increase to cut the
budget deficit released a study indicating that over the past 10
years the share of all federal taxes falling on the poor has risen
by 12 percent while the burden on upper-income Americans has
dropped by 4.3 percent.
   The 50 percent of taxpayers considered to have middle income _
between $20,000 and $60,000 _ saw a 3.4 percent rise in their share
of the burden. Those with incomes under $20,000 constitute about
one-third of the population; those over $60,000, about one-sixth.
   The Coalition Against Regressive Taxation, whose members include
state and local government officials, truckers, and the tobacco and
alcohol industries, said any increase in taxes on gasoline,
cigarettes, wine, liquor or beer would worsen that disparity, since
excise levies are acknowledged to fall more heavily on those with
less income.
   Tax Foundation economists calculate Tax Freedom Day by summing
up the total of taxes collected by federal, state and local
governments, including those paid by businesses, and dividing that
amount among workers. If every dollar earned this year were claimed
by governments until all taxes were paid, the average worker would
be paid up by quitting time on May 4.
   At this time last year, the foundation forecast a 1988 Tax
Freedom Day of May 5, which would have been the latest ever.
Economists now have looked back over the year and recalculated that
last year's date was May 3. But 1988 was a leap year, meaning the
average worker had to put in 124 days on the job to pay taxes, the
same as is projected for this year.
   The foundation has calculated Tax Freedom Day all the way back
to 1930, when the magic date was Feb. 13. It reached April 3 in
1950, April 28 in 1970 and May 1 in 1980. The earliest date in this
decade was April 28, 1984.
   Federal taxes will take one hour and 47 minutes out of the
average worker's eight-hour day this year, up one minute from last
year. State and local taxes will claim 56 minutes, same as a year
ago.
   The rest of the work day will be spent this year paying for:
housing one hour and 25 minutes, up one minute; food and tobacco 59
minutes, up a minute; transportation 40 cents, unchanged; medical
care 39 minutes, unchanged; clothing 24 minutes, up one minute;
recreation 20 minutes, down two minutes, and all other, including
education, savings and religion, 50 minutes, down two minutes.

<HEAD>Bush Urges ``Partial Deregulation of Education''</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 3 grafs at end with background on plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush proposed a ``partial
deregulation of education'' Thursday, saying schools in poorer
communities would be given more flexibility in how they may spend
government money.
   Aides said Bush's proposal, an expansion of the package he
announced last week, would result in the elimination of burdensome
federal regulations.
   Bush, speaking at an education conference at Union High School,
sought to build public support for his education package while
renewing his argument that more money from the government will not
necessarily improve educational performance.
   ``We need to rely less on the collective wallet and more on our
collective will,'' he said.
   Bush, who campaigned on a theme of wanting to be the ``education
president,'' last week proposed $441 million in new spending for
school programs _ but without spelling out where the money would
come from.
   Overall, Bush's budget would freeze federal spending on many
education programs. It calls for total education spending of $21.9
billion _ the same level sought by former President Reagan in his
fiscal 1990 budget.
   Bush's proposals include awards and grants to outstanding
schools and teachers, an expanded program of magnet schools that
focus on curriculum specialties, and more funds for historically
black colleges. The plan has been criticzed as inadequate by
congressional Democrats.
   Bush told his audience, ``We want to help those most in need,
targeting federal resources where they can do the most good.''
   ``We want to waive some regulations for poorer communities,
allowing them to pool state and federal funds in exchange for
higher accountability and performance _ a kind of
performance-driven, partial deregulation of education, if you
will.''
   ``We'll give you the flexibility, you show us the results,''
Bush told a cheering audience of educators and students.
   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos told reporters on Air Force
One that the administration would seek to relax regulations ``to
get funds to local schools without a lot of paperwork and a lot of
bureaucracy.''
   ``In essence, it is a type of deregulation,'' Cavazos said. He
said, however, that it would not represent a return to block grants
to schools, abandoned during the Reagan administration.
   He also said that, while poor communities would be the first to
benefit from the relaxation in federal regulations, the flexibility
would eventually be extended to other communities as well.
   On his way to the speech, Bush's motorcade made an unannounced
stop at Hamilton School, where the president greeted Gina Marie
Sisco, a sixth-grade student who had written him a letter.
   She was among a group of flag-waving students clustered on the
curb outside the school.
   In the letter, a portion of which Bush later read during his
speech, the young correspondent said only students who had won an
academic fitness award had been invited to the president's speech.
   ``I am a resource room student for math and English. I have a
learning disability. There are many kids like me and we all have to
work harder than most kids,'' she wrote.
   Bush praised Miss Sisco, saying, ``It's excellence and it's hard
work.''
   Barbara Bush attended the speech and was given a rousing
applause when her husband introduced her.
   ``She got a good clean bill of health yesterday from Walter Reed
Army Hospital,'' Bush said. Mrs. Bush received a radioactive iodine
treatment at the hospital to deal with a thyroid problem.
   In his speech, Bush said of money and education, ``A nation that
worships money _ or sees money as a cure for all that ails it _ is
a society in peril.''
   ``More spending isn't the only right answer or even the best
answer,'' he said. ``What we need is better value for what we
spend. What we need ... is a shared determination on the part of
every American to get involved with our schools. ... We must
reestablish the value of teaching and learning in this country.''
   Bush's ``partial deregulation'' plan closely follows
recommendations that were made to him after the election by the
Rochester, N.Y.-based National Center on Education and the Economy
headed by Apple Computer chairman John Sculley.
   The group has proposed waiving red tape and regulations in favor
of innovative local plans approved by state and federal
governments. Freedom from the rules would continue as long as
students met the performance targets set in the plans. As
envisioned by the center, the experiments would be used later as
models to revamp federal programs.
   Sculley said last month that Bush had been ``extremely
interested in what we had to say'' at a meeting in December. Both
teacher unions have endorsed the concept, at least on an
experimental basis.

<HEAD>Bill Introduced</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two members of Congress introduced legislation
Thursday urging creation of a voluntary community service program,
increasing G.I. bill benefits and calling on the Bush
administration to develop a mandatory national service plan.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., said
that although eight other national service measures exist, their
bill addresses the true concept of national service.
   ``There are those of us, Congressman Porter and myself, who
believe all Americans should serve their country. That is the basic
linchpin of this legislation,'' McCain told a news conference.
   The main aspect of the bill is the mandatory service proposal
that includes part-time and full-time community service programs as
well as full-time service in the active, reserve or National Guard
elements of the armed forces, or service in the Coast Guard.
   ``I realize that will be roundly criticized in some sectors of
our society but I think the worse thing was the injustice
perpetrated during the Vietnam War,'' McCain said. ``We asked a
certain economic level of our society to serve and allowed another
economic level of our society to remain at home.''
   McCain fought in Vietnam and spent 5 1@2 years as a prisoner of
war.
   Under the part-time community service program, volunteers will
serve 24 hours per month and two weeks during the year. Service
will be two to four years.
   Current G.I. bill benefits would be raised from $10,800 to
$15,120 for active duty members, and could be used for education,
vocational training or toward the purchase of a first primary
residence.
   The program's costs, according to the legislation, must fall
within existing budgets. The initial cost of the community service
program is $250 million with states providing the full matching
funds. Increases in the G.I. bill will be part of the Defense
Department budget.
   Porter said the legislation would ``provide the groundwork for a
resurgence in national service by encouraging young Americans to
make a commitment to their country.''

<UNK>Soviet Advisers Saw Combat in Vietnam, Military Newspaper Says</UNK>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet military advisers helped their North
Vietnamese allies shoot down American airplanes with missiles
during the Vietnam War, the Soviet Defense Ministry newspaper
reported Thursday.
   Red Star carried a series of reminiscences that were believed to
be the first direct admission that Soviet military advisers engaged
in combat in the war.
   The newspaper's disclosures were typical of the greater openness
by the Soviet military under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But
they sounded a jarring note at a time when improved superpower
relations have brought more sympathetic coverage of the United
States by state-run media.
   Red Star said it was printing the reminiscences in response to
requests from readers.
   ``With three missiles, we brought down four planes,'' said Sgt.
N. Kolesnik, recalling a July night in 1965 when the troops he was
advising set up an anti-aircraft battery near a ruined town that
American pilots used for target practice.
   ``All of us worked well,'' Kolesnik said, naming fellow Soviets
he called the targeting officer, the computation commander, the
operator and other soldiers at ``the firing stations.''
   Later, Kolesnik said, the Vietnamese the Soviets were training
set up wooden decoys of missiles. After bombing the decoys to no
avail, the departing American planes ran into the enemy field of
fire and three Skyhawks were downed, Kolesnik said.
   The Soviets began training Vietnamese rocket troops in spring of
1965, Gen. Maj. G. Belov told Red Star.
   The soldiers' recollections mainly concerned training Vietnamese
to work with Zenith missiles and the battle to keep technologically
ahead of the Americans.
   The U.S. forces changed their schedule of air sorties after the
Soviets arrived, according to excerpts from the diary of Col. G.
Lyubinetsky. Previously they had flown on a regular schedule with
breaks and predictable days off.
   But after the Soviet specialists arrived, ``They realized that
they had to take the rocket forces seriously,'' Lyubinetsky wrote.
   Col. V. Fyodorov recalled that in 1966, when a Vietnamese
division ``was running a battle independently, already without the
participation of our specialists,'' it brought down an American
plane and the captured pilot refused to believe that the Vietnamese
had acted on their own.
   ``I don't believe you,'' he said when he was assured the
Vietnamese were responsible. ``Something smells Russian here.''
   During an unspecified period of battle while the Soviet regiment
was in action, 43 missiles brought down 23 American planes,
Fyodorov said.
   Belov said Soviets died in Vietnam, but did not say how many.
   One officer recalled being personally thanked for Soviet aid by
North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh, and another said he saw a
Soviet soldier throw himself on a bomb to save a young Vietnamese
girl.
   When two Soviet technicians were leaving for home, Vietnamese
officers and soldiers ``were practically crying'' and walked a long
way behind their departing car calling, ``Linso, Linso,'' the
Vietnamese word for Soviet, Maj. Gen. A Trombachev said.
   ``That's how friendly you can get in eight months,'' he said.
   A recent article in Red Star described Soviet missile
specialists' work in the Middle East, and an editor's note
accompanying Thursday's article said readers also had asked for
information on Soviet troops in Syria and North Korea.

   City workers protested for a third day
Thursday in an attempt to prevent layoffs of more than one-third of
Elizabeth's public safety employees, including all ambulance
workers.
   About 75 police officers, firefighters and emergency medical
workers gathered Thursday outside the Springfield campaign office
of Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick, a candidate for governor.
   Elizabeth Mayor Thomas Dunn, who took to carrying a pistol after
a rowdy post-midnight rally by about 200 city employees outside his
house, has blamed Hardwick for the city's budget shortfall.
   Dunn said the speaker will not put up for a vote a
distressed-cities bill that could ease the budget problems for this
working-class city of 106,000 people.
   Most of the 221 layoffs are scheduled for Friday, including 82
police officers, 68 firefighters and all 38 of the city's ambulance
workers.
   On May 29, 19 more police and 14 additional firefighters are set
to be cut, leaving 232 people in the police department and 192 in
the fire department.
   ``I don't believe this city can survive with the cuts,'' said
Paul Partazana, president of the Elizabeth Police Benevolent
Association. ``This city can't be declared safe with that amount of
police officers left behind to protect it.''
   Partazana said the safety workers would continue protesting, but
a Superior Court judge has issued orders limiting the gatherings.
   The protesters stayed outside Dunn's house until about 1:30 a.m.
Wednesday, singing songs filled with expletives and chanting ``Save
our jobs.'' Dunn said a dead fish was thrown on his porch.
   Later that morning, the protest moved to the house of John F.
Papetti, city business administrator, and the injunction
prohibiting protests outside elected officials' houses was
requested and granted.
   Also on Wednesday, about 150 of the workers scheduled for
layoffs filled the City Hall lobby to sign up for unemployment
benefits.
   Papetti said garbage disposal costs have tripled from about $4
million to about $12 million in one year because of new state
environmental regulations, and that distressed-city money dropped
from about $10 million to about $7 million during the same period.
   ``The state says to go pay for these things, survive, but nobody
says how,'' Papetti said.
   The state's distressed-cities fund was cut to $70 million this
year from $120 million last year. Gov. Tom Kean recently proposed a
compromise that would supply an additional $65 million, but Speaker
Hardwick has criticized the measure as a disguised tax increase.
   Another 150 people are scheduled for layoffs Friday from other
city departments.

   President Bush has selected Eddie Brown, the
first Indian to head a major state agency in Arizona, to oversee
the operation of the trouble-plagued Bureau of Indian Affairs, the
White House announced Thursday.
   Brown, the former director of the Arizona Department of Economic
Security and a member of the Pascua Yaqui tribe, will be nominated
as assistant secretary for Indian affairs at the Interior
Department.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Brown has ``a broad
background in intergovernmental relations with Native Americans''
as well as prior experience with the bureau, where he was a
division chief in 1985.
   As the top Interior Department official specifically in charge
of Indian affairs, Brown will oversee an agency that has been the
subject of sharp congressional criticism in recent months because
of alleged improprieties involving the BIA and other Indian matters.
   ``Eddie will make an excellent assistant secretary,'' Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., said in a statement. ``I can think of no one more
highly qualified for the BIA spot, and I commend this appointment
very highly.''
   However, the Arizona Senate's Republican leader, John Mawhinney
of Tucson, had a mixed view: ``If the job calls for somebody with
an extraordinary understanding of assorted Indian tribes ... then
he's an excellent choice. But if they're looking for someone with
very strong managerial and supervisory skills, I think they've got
the wrong man.''
   Brown, 43, drew praise during six years as an assistant director
of the state's Department of Economic Security for reshaping the
state's contractual relations with tribal governments in what
became a national model. He also won respect of Indian leaders and
federal officials as director of the BIA`s social-services division
in 1985 and 1986.
   But, appointed the head of the Arizona department in January
1987 by then-Gov. Evan Mecham, he ran into complaints from
legislators and others that he was in over his head as the top man.
   Complaints concerned delayed payments to vendors and delayed
services to department clients, and costly mixups in how state and
federal funds were used. One delay lost the department $4.4 million
in federal funds.
   The BIA is the arm of the Interior Department that oversees
Indian welfare, education, natural resources and economic growth.
Its programs and policies affect more than 1.4 milion Indians and
Alaska natives.
   The position of BIA commisioner is vacant and Brown, as
assistant secretary for Indian affairs, will oversee the bureau's
operations.
   The BIA has been under sharp criticism in Congress where a
Senate select committee has held a series of hearings that
disclosed cases of fraud, Mafia infiltration and child sexual
abuses on Indian reservations under the eyes of the federal agency.
   McCain and other senators, including Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., who have been involved in the hearings have said the
findings make clear the bureau is in need of major overhaul.
   ``The BIA has been grossly negligent in protecting the resource
that American Indians care about most deeply _ their families,''
DeConcini said after the conclusion of the recent set of hearings
in February, which included one session about sexual abuse among
Indian children.
   The Select Senate Committee on Indian Affairs plans additional
hearings later in the year on other subjects affecting Indians
including natural resource management, Indian health services and
housing programs and education _ all of which the BIA has been
accused of not overseeing adequately.
   In other Interior Department appointments:
   _ Frank A. Bracken, a Muncie, Ind., business executive, will be
nominated as undersecretary of Interior. Bracken is the board
chairman of Ball-InCon Glass Packaging Corp., in Muncie.
   _ Martin L. Allday of Midland, Texas, will be nominated as the
department's solicitor. Allday has been an attorney in private
practice in Midland since 1959 and a specialist in oil, gas and
minerals law.

<HEAD>UN Says Iran-Iraq Peace Talks Resuming April 20 In Geneva</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Direct peace talks between the foreign
ministers of Iran and Iraq will resume April 20, eight months to
the day after a cease-fire took effect in the 8-year-old war, U.N.
officials said Thursday.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will mediate the talks
in Geneva between Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz of
Iraq, U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said.
   He read a statement from Perez de Cuellar urging both nations to
show more flexibility in the talks, which have been stalled almost
since they began Aug. 25, five days after the truce.
   It suggested the secretary-general would press Iraq to withdraw
from the Iranian territory occupied in the last days of fighting
and urge Iran to cooperate in clearing the Shatt-al-Arab, Iraq's
only sea outlet. The border waterway, closed early in the war, is
clogged with sunken ships and silt.
   ``The secretary-general and his special representative have
emphasized the need for withdrawal without delay to the
internationally recognized boundaries, the release and repatriation
of the prisoners of war and the speedy beginning of the mediation
efforts'' for a peace agreement, said the statement read by
Giuliani.
   Iraq occupies at least 260 square miles of Iranian territory,
according to U.N. estimates. Iran has said withdrawal must be
accomplished before prisoners are repatriated or other issues are
discussed.
   ``Pragmatic arrangements, particularly with regard to the
economic life of the two countries, may well be needed to hasten
the return to normality,'' the statement said in apparent reference
to Iraq's demand that the Shatt be cleared.
   Perez de Cuellar will be in Geneva on April 19-25 as part of a
European tour. His special representative for the peace talks,
Swedish U.N. Ambassador Jan K. Eliasson, will accompany him to the
negotiations.
   Giuliani said the negotiations probably would last two days,
preceded by individual meetings with Velayati and Aziz. Separate
meetings with Iranian and Iraqi officials who visited New York led
to the resumption.

<TEXT>
   Hungarian-born conductor Georges Sebastian, who led
orchestras from San Francisco to Moscow in a career that spanned 50
years, has died at the age of 85.
   Radio France, where Sebastian worked after World War II, said
the retired conductor died Wednesday at his home outside Paris.
   Long considered the musical heir to Austrian conductor Bruno
Walter, Sebastian was best known for his German post-romantic
repertory. During the 1950s, he conducted operas starring diva
Maria Callas and others.
   Sebastian was born in Budapest on Aug. 17, 1903, and trained
under Bela Bartok. He made his operatic debut in Munich as choral
director under Walter and later became his assistant.
   In 1923-24 his work took him to the Metropolitan Opera in New
York. He was the music director for a Soviet radio station in
Moscow from 1931-37, and conducted soloist Sergei Prokofiev, the
Russian composer, pianist and conductor.
   Fleeing the Nazis in World War II, Sebastian returned to the
United States where he led the San Francisco Opera and the
Philharmonic Orchestra of Scranton, Pa.

<HEAD>Dingell Says Congress Should Be Overseeing Telephone Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is ready to assume federal guidance
of the telephone industry with legislation that would spur new
technologies and make sure consumers don't foot the bill, Rep. John
Dingell said Thursday.
   The Michigan Democrat, in an address to an audience of telephone
company executives, said the industry won't like everything
Congress is going to do on telecommunications issues this year,
that lawmakers ``will not satisfy the corporate protagonists in
this debate.''
   ``It will include provisions that one side will say are
unnecessary, and the other will decry as insufficient,'' said
Dingell, who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
that deals with telephone issues.
   But he said it was time Congress lifted current restrictions on
the Bell operating companies that ``limit their ability to grow and
their ability to bring new products and services to the American
marketplace.''
   Dingell said he wants to return to Congress the ability to
oversee the development of the telecommunications industry, end
restrictions that ``constrain technological development and deprive
users of access to products and services'' and protect residential
subscribers ``from paying for the competitive ventures of the
telephone companies.''
   He said existing telecommunications policy under Congress, the
courts and the Federal Communications Commission is ``ad hoc and
uncoordinated. It makes no sense.''
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene, Dingell said, has been
faced with an impossible situation in his effort to oversee the
Modification of Final Judgment under which American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. split off the regional phone companies in 1984.
   The regional companies were prohibited from entering the
long-distance, manufacturing or information services marketplaces.
   Greene's dilemma, Dingell said, is to watch out for possible
antitrust violations by the powerful telephone companies while at
the same time recognizing the impact of his decisions on
international trade, universal telephone service and U.S.
competitiveness in information technologies.
   ``The more the judge takes these factors into account, the more
he usurps the authorities of the Congress,'' Dingell said. ``He can
properly limit his purview to questions of antitrust and end up
with decisions that are not in the larger national interest.''
   Dingell cited a recent decision by Greene to allow one of the
seven regional Bell companies, Pacific Telesis, to participate in a
trans-Pacific telephone cable project.
   He said the judge's ``decision repeatedly addresses the foreign
trade aspects of Pac Tel's participation and concludes that the
benefits outweigh any potential antitrust concerns.''
   Dingell said Congress, or an agency overseen by Congress, should
be making such decisions.
   ``It is not my purpose to criticize the judge for that decision.
My purpose is simply to point out that he is in an impossible
position,'' Dingell said.
   ``It is time for Congress to legislate the structure of the
American telecommunications industry and permit Judge Green to
return to his other duties and obligations.''
   Dingell said Reps. Al Swift, D-Wash., and Tom Tauke, R-Iowa,
were putting final touches on such legislation and it would be
introduced next week.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's ambassador to the United States
clashed Thursday with the American Society of Newspaper Editors in
an incident reflecting the intractability of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
   Ambassador Moshe Arad accused James Squires, editor of the
Chicago Tribune and one of the organizers of the annual ASNE
meeting, of seeking to embarrass Israel by inviting a PLO
representative to address the convention along with Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir.
   Shamir spoke to the group earlier Thursday and was followed less
than two hours later by Nabil Shaath, the political adviser to
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat.
   Originally, Shamir was scheduled to make a back-to-back
appearance after Shaath, but organizers rescheduled at the last
minute to accomodate the Israelis' desire that Shamir and Shaath
not bump into each other, Squires said in an interview.
   Squires said he was ``quite astonished to hear'' from Arad that
Shamir could not appear on the same day as Shaath, but he
nonethless assured the ambassador he would do all he could to
prevent any meeting between the two men or their security details.
   He conceded he had told Arad he might be able to move Shaath's
appearance to the following day although he did not know if the
Palestinian's schedule would permit such a change.
   Arad said Squires had promised to try and schedule any PLO
speaker for the following day and ``I am deeply dismayed by this
breach of commitment on your behalf.''
   Arad said Squires had failed to inform him until this week of
the invitation extended to the PLO ``and an attempt to put them on
the same platform in direct sequence to each other reflected an
attempt to embarrass us.''
   Arad said he ``could not imagine'' that Squires had not known
Shaath would appear so closely following Shamir and ``still you
preferred to withhold this information. I find the entire handling
of the invitation most inappropriate and unethical.''
   Squires insisted that Arad ``was given no misleading
information'' about the speaking engagements, saying ``it's
ridiculous for them to dictate to us how we run our meeting.
   ``It's none of Mr. Arad's business who we choose to invite to
the ASNE meeting,'' Squires said. ``It's exactly the kind of
absurdity that this Middle East conflict is producing.''

<TEXT>
   A 57-year-old man who grabbed
Olympic sprinter Florence Griffith-Joyner in a passionate embrace
last August lunged at Princess Diana when she visited this town
northern town Thursday.
   Edward Adcock, a carpenter, said he meant no harm to the
27-year-old princess when he jumped over railings as she spoke to a
crowd outside a workshop for the mentally handicapped.
   ``I am sorry if I caused her any upset because I have always
admired her enormously,'' he said. ``I might have been in the
process of trying to give her a hug. She is attractive and I fancy
her, but I didn't realize it would finish up this way.
   ``I may appear calm on the surface, but inside me there is
turmoil. I have had some trouble in past years and now it has come
up again. But there is no way I would be violent or harm anyone.''
   Television pictures show the princess was startled. She stepped
backward as three burly detectives hurled themselves between her
and Adcock, but quickly regained her composure and continued
chatting with people in the crowd.
   A Northumbria police spokesman said further inquiries would be
made and no charges had yet been filed.
   In August, Adcock grabbed the American sprinter from behind as
she peeled off her track suit after winning a race in Gateshead. He
was not charged.
   Adcock wonders how his workmates at a building site will regard
his latest caper. ``They pulled my leg a lot over the Flo-Jo
business,'' he said.
   One person clearly was not pleased.
   Hetty Adcock, the carpenter's 85-year-old mother, broke into
tears when she heard the news and cried: ``Oh no! Not again!''

   A man going before a judge on firearms
charges Thursday threatened to blow up the courtroom and demanded
to talk to President Bush before guards wrestled him to the floor
and seized a briefcase loaded with explosives.
   ``He freaked out and said `I have a bomb here,' or something to
that effect, and everybody started scrambling,'' said Ed Tucker,
first assistant prosecutor for Elizabeth. ``I'm told that he wanted
to talk to the president. Officers were able to secure the attache
case and secure him.''
   Tucker identified the man as James Cecil, 36, of Avenel. Cecil
also claimed he planted other bombs in the building, which houses
the county administration and Superior Court, Tucker said.
   The incident happened in the third-floor courtroom of Superior
Court Judge Leonard Sachar at about 1:30 p.m. Bush gave a speech
earlier Thursday in Union, which is about seven miles from the
courthouse, and left Newark International Airport at 2:32 p.m.
   Bomb-sniffing dogs searched the building for other explosives,
Tucker said.
   ``It was definitely a live bomb, a black-powder bomb,'' Tucker
said. ``The judge was in the process of hearing whether his case
was to go to the grand jury.''
   The Union County Bomb Squad removed the briefcase from the
building, which was evacuated immediately after the threat. Cecil
was held in the Union County Jail, Tucker said, adding that no
additional charges were immediately filed.

   The government on Thursday announced that
Burma and the Central African Republic, because of violations of
worker rights, are being dropped from a program offering developing
nations duty-free entry of goods into the United States.
   At the same time, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said her
office had rejected requests that Israel and Malaysia be denied the
benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences program because
of allegations about similar violations.
   In Israel's case, the government investigated complaints from
the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee that Arabs from the
West Bank and Gaza who travel to work in Israel are denied certain
rights and receive less wages and benefits than do other Israeli
workers.
   The USTR declined to revoke Israel's trade benefits, saying the
country was ``taking steps to afford internationally recognized
worker rights.''
   The government also refused to investigate the American Arab
group's allegations that Palestinians working inside the occupied
territories are being discriminated against, saying the West Bank
and Gaza are not legally considered part of Israel.
   Faris Bouhafa, a spokesman for the American Arab group, said his
organization was pleased that steps apparently are being taken to
correct violations within Israel and with the finding that the
territories are not part of Israel. However, he said his group
would have preferred that duty-free trade benefits be denied to
Israel ``until conditions were cleared up in their entirety.''
   The Generalized System of Preferences program was begun in 1976
to promote the economic growth of developing countries and help
them compete with industrialized countries in the U.S. market. It
provides preferential duty-free entry to about 4,100 products from
136 countries and territories.
   In 1984, the program was amended to require that countries'
benefits under the program be suspended if they are not working to
provide internationally recognized worker rights.
   Benefits for Burma and the Central African Republic had been
challenged by the AFL-CIO because of restrictions on the right to
organize independent unions and other alleged violations of rights.
The AFL-CIO also had filed complaints alleging violations of worker
rights in Haiti, Syria and Malaysia.
   A complaint against Liberia had been filed by the Lawyers
Committee on Human Rights, which alleged that the Liberian
government restricts workers' rights to organize unions and bargain
collectively.
   Venezuela's trade benefits had been challenged by Occidental
Petroleum, based on its claim that the company's assets were
expropriated without compensation by Venezuela's government-owned
oil company in 1975.
   The USTR said Haiti, Liberia, Syria and Venezuela will continue
to be part of the duty-free trade program while the complaints
remain under review for up to a year.
   AFL-CIO spokeswoman Lorrie McHugh said the organization was
``extremely disappointed'' with the government's failure to act on
its petitions against Haiti, Syria and Malaysia.
   ``We feel that the other three countries should have been
removed because workers are being seriously exploited and denied
very basic rights,'' she said.
   The changes announced Thursday take effect July 1.

<HEAD>Queen Should Attend Burial Of Czar Nicholas, Expert Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II should be invited to a proper
Christian burial of the remains of the last Russian czar, which
were reported this week to have been found in the Soviet Union,
Burke's Peerage said Thursday.
   ``Not only the imperial family's relatives but others who wish
to show their sorrow for the fate of the last of the Romanovs
should be able to attend,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing
director of the bluebloods' guide.
   He said the queen should not accept President Mikail S.
Gorbachev's invitation to visit the Soviet Union until she is given
details of the fate of Czar Nicholas II and his family. Gorbachev
extended the invitation last Friday over lunch with the queen at
Windsor Castle at the end of a two-day visit here.
   The czar, a cousin of the queen's grandfather, King George V,
was shot with members of his family at Ekaterinburg by Bolshevik
revolutionaries in 1918.
   The Soviet weekly Moscow News reported Wednesday that a former
police officer-turned-screenwriter, Geli Ryabov, claimed to have
found the remains 10 years ago in a field near the execution site
but kept silent because times had not been right for publication.
   Ekaterinburg, about 900 miles east of Moscow, was renamed
Sverdlovsk after the revolution.
   Brooks-Baker said the question still to be answered was, ``Who
killed them?''
   ``It was either on orders right from the top or from a local
official in charge of the family, who panicked when anti-Red forces
_ probably the Czech Legion then in the area _ approached the
town,'' Brooks-Baker said.

   Ethiopia, often threatened by hunger, will get
a $72 million loan from the World Bank on easy terms, designed to
make imports of food and other goods easier by improving the Red
Sea port of Assab.
   An announcement by the bank Thursday said the money would go to
build two berths and cargo-handling equipment, and for the
replacement or repair of trucks. Exports as well as imports are
expected to be helped.
   The loan is for 40 years, including a 10 year grace period
during which only interest of less than 1 percent will be due.
   Fighting between government troops and rebels, who control much
of the provinces of Tigre and Eritrea, complicates transport
problems in the area. Assab is in Eritrea. Road and rail links
between the sea and the capital, Addis Ababa, have frequently been

<HEAD>Reject Mexico Criticism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted
14-3 on Thursday to reject an attempt to brand the government of
Mexico as uncooperative in the U.S. war against narcotics after
Secretary of State James A. Baker III declared such an accusation
is undeserved.
   The attempt was made by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who contended
that President Bush's certification of Mexico as cooperative in
narcotics-control efforts was unjustified.
   The committee acted after Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., read
a letter in which Baker said Mexican President Carlos Salinas ``has
repeatedly pledged to make the fight against narcotics traficking a
national priority.''
   Baker added: ``He has backed up his tough rhetoric against drugs
and corruption with concrete actions. I remain thoroughly convinced
that the best way to reduce the flow of drugs through and from
Mexico is by improving our bilateral anti-narcotics cooperation.''
   Had the Helms inititive prevailed, the United States would have
had to end any economic assistance to Mexico and vote against that
country in international financial institutions.
   Bush could have prevented that course of action by declaring
that certification of Mexico was in U.S. national security
interests, even though Congress had found it was not cooperating in
anti-nartcotics efforts.
   Only Sens. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., and Connie Mack, R-Fla.,
joined Helms in voting for the proposal.

<HEAD>Councilman Stirs Anger With Remark to Vietnamese Immigrants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city councilman conceded Thursday
that he may have misspoken when he told Vietnamese immigrants, ``If
you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South Vietnam.''
   Councilman Frank Fry stopped short of apologizing for the
remark, which he said was intended to suggest that immigrants need
to make more of an effort to assimilate into American society.
   Some Vietnamese immigrants in this suburban Orange County
community said they would try to recall Fry over the remark,
delivered Tuesday night before the council voted down a request for
a parade to honor Vietnam War dead.
   ``We're trying to promote harmony in the city,'' said Tien
Nguyen, a member of the organizing committee for South Vietnamese
Armed Forces Day. ``We are observing the American way, as well as
our heritage.''
   Parade committee spokesman Arthur Suchesk called Fry's comments
``nothing more than a bigoted, racial slur against the Vietnamese.
... It's like telling the Irish to go back to Ireland if they want
to celebrate St. Patrick's Day or Mexicans that they can't
celebrate Cinco de Mayo. He ought to be impeached.''
   Fry was among four of five councilmembers who voted against
closing a street in the city's Little Saigon area for a June 18
parade to honor South Vietnamese and Americans killed in the
Vietnam War.
   Three of the four councilmembers who voted down the two-hour
parade said the parade organizing committee should time its event
to conform with a U.S. holiday, such as Memorial Day.
   ``It's my opinion that you're all Americans and you'd better be
Americans. If you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South
Vietnam,'' Fry told the parade organizers. ``That may be unfair,
but that's my opinion and I'm sure that is the opinion of a lot of
people around here.''
   Fry, a World War II veteran, said Thursday he had received about
five calls from Vietnamese immigrants supporting his statement,
because they believe the immigrants should assimilate. But he said
it may have been ``a little harsh'' to tell the immigrants to go
back to their homeland.
   Fry said he meant only to counsel the immigrants to ``try to
change and become an American, learn English, it is your new
language. Join in with the populace and learn your new ways.''
   ``I don't mind being recalled,'' he added, ``but the
polarization that would cause would be horrendous.''

<TEXT>
   Covered with sweat, sometimes
collapsing from the heat and the odor, Sergio Martinez dug alone
for more than an hour as the body of a man about 30 years old
emerged from the four-by-two foot hole.
   The man had a gold front tooth and had been gagged and
blindfolded. There was a rectangular cut over the left side of his
chest, which had been pulled up and out as if his heart had been
ripped out.
   Police said one of the other 12 victims recovered from this
ranch 13 miles west of Matamoros had had his heart ripped out while
he was still alive _ a sacrificial rite once used by Aztec priests.
   Martinez, 22, is one of five suspects arrested in what has been
called a cult of human sacrifice. Police on both sides of the
border are seeking the reputed leader or priest of the gang, Alonso
de Jesus Constanzo, a Cuban national who had contacts in Miami.
   Police officer Rodrigo Monforte said Martinez had volunteered
information on the 13th body and took police to the ranch just off
the border highway along the Rio Grande.
   Police said they believe there is still another victim buried
near the wooden shack that served the gang for the ritual murders.
   Martinez, who insisted he was only a farm hand and had nothing
to do with the murders, wore blue jeans and a dark blue shirt.
   Police unlocked his right handcuff and gave him a pick and
shovel. He dug next to a pile of bales of cattlefeed.
   He turned to police and asked to be allowed to rest and then
asked for a tractor to dig the hole. ``Come on, use your hands,''
policemen yelled at him.
   He was given brief periods of rest during which he told newsmen
that he had only buried the body. ``The padrino or Elio killed
him,'' he said.
   As he dug, a man who came in wearing a large crucifix on his
chest read Psalms from a Bible a few feet away from Martinez.
   ``I am a Christian,'' said the man who identified himself as
Santos Yzaguirre. I came here to pray for the souls of all the
people buried here.''
   When the body was found, Martinez turned to police and asked for
a face mask. ``Keep working,'' he was told. ``You didn't need one
when you buried him.''
   However, he was given a mask minutes later when he said he could
not work because of the stench.
   Another time, soaking in sweat, he turned to an agent and asked,
``Are you going to give me a chance to bathe before I go back to
jail?''
   ``Yes,'' he was told. ``Just finish the job you started.''
   One time he collapsed to the ground and asked for water. A
federal agent turned to the journalists and asked: ``Does any of
you have any water with you?''
   Nobody did, but two onlookers with the police started helping
Martinez.
   The body was naked and wrapped in a bedsheet.
   ``All I did was bury him,'' Martinez insisted. ``The `padrino'
(godfather) did the killings. I was just a ranch hand. I did not
see the killings.''
   ``These people were totally dominated by the Cuban,'' said a
watching federal agent who declined to give his name. ``They
believed what he did actually protected them agains police on the
Mexican side. They killed the American to seek protection from the
U.S. police.
   ``This man believes he is without guilt. He thinks burying a
murdered man is like burying a rabbit,'' the agent added.

<HEAD>Student Launches Crusade against Whale Killing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a little help from his friends,
a teen-ager who wants to save whales has taken on big business,
organized a rally and helped dispel the notion that youthful
activism is dead.
   Eric Kessler, a senior at Highland Park High School, said
Thursday he launched his crusade after seeing an environmental
group's petition urging Marriott Corp. to stop buying Icelandic
fish in a move to halt commercial whale kills.
   ``Amazing things are going on at our school and all over
Chicago. This started with five or 10 of my friends and it's grown
to astronomical proportions,'' Kessler, 17, said in a telephone
interview.
   Marriott, a diversified hospitality company, had a contract to
supply Icelandic fish to the cafeteria at the school in this
northern suburb _ until Eric got involved.
   Eric expressed his concern to school food-service workers, and
telephoned Marriott headquarters in suburban Washington. Icelandic
fish was taken off the menu last month, as a result of his efforts.
   Bolstered by success, Eric and a handful of friends began
planning a rally to support their position that Iceland is
violating a 1986 International Whaling Commission moratorium on the
killing of whales for commercial purposes.
   Iceland maintains whales are being killed only for research.
   With advice and help from environmental groups like Greenpeace,
which has organized an international boycott of companies that buy
Icelandic fish, Kessler began distributing leaflets and making
phone calls advertising the rally.
   He said celebrities such as scientist Carl Sagan, musician Paul
Winter, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Highland Park's mayor have
promised to write letters of support for the April 21 rally.
   Students urged students at other high schools to come to the
rally in front of the school, and Kessler estimates more than 1,000
people will show up to hear speeches by him, a Greenpeace official
and others.
   ``Things have just been flying. I get calls every night from
people who say, `I can do this for you, or have you tried to take
this route,''' Kessler said.
   School authorities are barred from officially endorsing the
rally, but several said they support Eric's activism and plan to
attend.
   ``I think Eric raised appropriate sensitivity to the issue to
the food-services division,'' said Principal Ronald Tesch, adding,
``I'm certain it had an influence'' on the decision to stop buying
Icelandic fish.
   ``We encourage our kids to think and to act on their
convictions,'' said counselor Vernon Hein. ``Eric isn't making it a
school issue, he's making it a kind of community concern.''
   ``He's really a go-getter. People like Eric are making it
happen,'' said Sally Shoup, a whale campaigner at Greenpeace's
Washington office.
   Marriott contends it's a politica _ not an environmental _ issue.
   ``To our knowledge, Iceland fish processors have nothing to do
with the establishment of that country's whale-research program,''
said Marriott spokeswoman Leslie Schlaggs.
   ``We feel that any kind of economic boycott would be harming or
targeting the wrong people,'' she said, and Marriott explained that
position to Eric.
   But he's hooked on activism.
   ``It's taking over my life and it's a great feeling,'' said
Eric, who plans to study environmental conservation at the
University of Colorado next fall.
   Said 15-year-old colleague Becky Auster, a Highland Park
sophomore: ``It definitely gives me hope, because a lot of people
tend to think that today's younger generation is really apathetic
and doesn't care what's happening.
   ``This shows they do care, they just need someone to help them
get started.''

<HEAD>Vagrant Charged In Fatal Fire Known as `Trouble'</HEAD>

   He was a small man known as ``Trash Can
Joe,'' a vagrant who lived mostly at a mission. But he could turn
violent, and when he was thrown out of an apartment house he
returned to set it on fire, killing seven children and two young
mothers, authorities say.
   Joe Pickens, 34, held Thursday on a $2 million bond, is charged
with first-degree murder and arson in Tuesday's fire. Authorities
said the victims died in their sleep as the second floor of their
ramshackle frame house filled with smoke and flames.
   ``Joe was a small guy _ he couldn't whip a flea,'' said Jim
Garner, who lives across the street from the burned-out house. ``He
didn't even have the mind of a teenager. I just don't know what to
think.''
   Richard Brienen, superintendent at the Peoria Rescue Mission,
Pickens' most frequent address, said Pickens could be mean and
vengeful when drunk and once threw bricks at the mission after
being ejected for breaking its rules.
   ``My nickname for him was Trouble,'' Brienen told reporters.
``The guys used to call him Trash Can Joe. Sometimes when he'd get
kicked out of here he would just go crawl out in the trash cans to
sleep.''
   Pickens had numerous run-ins with the law, police said. On March
31, he ignored a judge's order to begin serving a 30-day sentence
for resisting arrest, the Peoria Journal Star reported. It was his
22nd misdemeanor conviction since 1983.
   The missed jail date was included on the jail's list of
violations to be brought to the attention of Peoria County State's
Attorney Kevin Lyons _ an action the jail says takes about two
weeks.
   ``I don't fault the sheriff or the jail,'' Lyons said. ``The
impression (that the fire could have been avoided) is not unusual
in any tragedy.
   ``It's like if one of (the victims) had been just visiting, and
the mother says `If only I had kept them home.'''
   Neighbors were not sure when Pickens, a native of York, Ala.,
first appeared in Peoria, or why.
   Garner said Pickens, whom he has known about two years, could
not read or write and had the mind of a 10-year-old.
   Fire Chief G. John Parker said Pickens apparently stayed in the
apartment house he set afire but was ordered out Monday night,
though Parker did not know why.
   On Wednesday, Pickens admitted to police that he had set the
fire in a rollaway bed in a vacant first-floor apartment early
Tuesday morning.
   ``He was an easy-going guy until he got into the booze,'' Garner
said. ``I guess he wanted to scare them because they put him out,
but that's a terrible way to scare somebody.''
   Garner's wife Claudie said Pickens was a friend of Joyce Barnes,
one of two residents of the house to survive the blaze.
   ``She'd ask him to leave sometimes but he'd usually come back,''
said Mrs. Garner. ``I'm angry and hurt and surprised he'd do
something like that to those folks. They were nice and never did
anything to hurt anyone.''
   Killed in the fire were Terry Davis, 27, and her three children:
Karlissa, 2, Arnisha, 7, and Tanoa, 10; Davis' sister, Wanda Hobbs,
20, and her children: Ashley, 1, Felicia, 4, and Eugene Roberts
Jr., two months; and Jacolby Thomas, 2, daughter of Ms. Barnes.
   Ms. Barnes and Eric Davis, 14, were hospitalized.

<TEXT>
   The real-life participants in the rescue
of toddler Jessica McClure from a well got a taste of Tinseltown on
Thursday, appearing as extras in location filming for a television
movie about the rescue.
   However, most found that show business isn't all glamour and
lights.
   ``I think I'll stick to police business,'' said Police Chief
Richard Czech, who, along with crew members and other extras, spent
almost five hours standing in a chilling drizzle at Midland
International Airport.
   Most of the movie, titled ``Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of
Jessica McClure,'' has been shot in suburban Los Angeles, but the
crew is spending two days in Midland filming scenes of oil rigs,
drilling rigs and the city's streets and skyline.
   The use of local extras and local details, such as the actual
jet belonging to Midland oilman Clayton Williams Jr. which brought
an underground expert to the rescue scene, adds to the true-to-life
feeling the movie is trying to depict, said producer John Kander II.
   The film will show the story of 18-month-old Jessica's October
1987 rescue from an abandoned water well after being trapped
underground for 58 hours.
   Czech, who is portrayed in the movie by actor Beau Bridges,
participated in Thursday's shoot playing an unidentified man who
greets the underground expert.
   ``They're trying to portray this as closely as possible, doing
all the little details the way they should be,'' said Czech, who
also consulted with the moviemakers when the script was put
together.
   Police officer Andy Glasscock doubled as himself in one of the
location scenes because actor Walter Olkewicz, who portrays his
character, and all but two of the other cast members didn't come to
Midland.
   Glasscock, Czech and others learned that making a movie involves
lots of waiting and standing around while huge props such as
airplanes are positioned. A brief shot of the landing of a Federal
Express cargo plane took more than an hour to shoot and required
two takes.
   The normally sunny, dry West Texas weather turned cold and wet,
and a real Federal Express crew to be used in one scene disappeared
when director Mel Damski was ready to begin shooting.
   Kandar lamented the puddles dotting the airport tarmac.
   ``Maybe we can work in that in Midland they wet down the tarmac
every day,'' he joked. ``But we have no time to put (filming) off.''
   The movie, produced by Interscope Communications and scheduled
to air Sunday, May 21, on ABC, will be delivered to the network
just two or three days ahead of time, Kander said.
   Robert O'Donnell, the paramedic who retrieved Jessica from the
well, also took part in the production, portraying a television
reporter who walks off an airplane with the rest of the press corps.
   O'Donnell, played by actor Sam Whipple in the movie, said the
television recreation of the rescue will show things that weren't
captured on the nationally televised coverage of the event.
   ``It will bring out the humanity of it _ the places when I
cried,'' he said. ``It was emotional and that's what I want people
to see.''

   About 100 hooded students protesting
government economic policies took over the grounds of the Central
University campus Thursday and threw homemade bombs at police,
authorities said.
   The protesters hijacked at least three trucks at entrances to
the university, dragging the drivers out and setting the vehicles
on fire.
   The protesters, their faces covered with T-shirts, crouched
behind barricades and threw homemade Molotov cocktails at police
stationed at intersections around the university.
   Under Venezuelan law, police are banned from entering the campus
of the university, an autonomous institution.
   Police occasionally fired tear gas in the direction of the
protesters.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   New economic measures designed to move Venezuela toward a
free-market economy have led to drastic price increases in consumer
goods and public services.
   Riots over the measures in late February left at least 276 dead
by government count, although other estimates put the number at
between 300 and 500.

<TEXT>
   A man who used an exotic animal business as cover
for a drug-smuggling ring that was broken up by the federal
government's ``Operation Cobra'' was sentenced Thursday to 100
years in federal prison.
   Mario Tabraue, 34, drew the sentence for his February
convictions on charges of racketeering and 13 narcotics counts.
   Tabraue didn't speak during the sentencing hearing, but his
attorney, Richard Sharpstein, asked U.S. District Judge James W.
Kehoe to consider the defendant's ``redeeming social values.''
   ``He was young, foolish, took a stupid road, but he was a
caring, loving individual with his family,'' Sharpstein said.
   The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Chaykin, asked
for ``a substantial period of incarceration.''
   ``The government has been accused of `puffing up' this case, but
there are very few cases involving drugs, murder and obstruction of
justice such as this one,'' Chaykin said.
   The case was called ``Operation Cobra'' because Tabraue owned an
exotic pet store and ranch, where he kept a giraffe, a cheetah and
rare birds. He was arrested in December 1987.
   During the three-month trial, the government presented testimony
and documents implicating Tabraue and some of his co-defendants in
large-scale cocaine and marijuana trafficking. There also was
testimony concerning the murder and dismemberment of a government
informant, Larry Nash, and the slaying of Tabraue's wife, Maria.
   Tabraue was acquitted of complicity in his wife's death, which
followed a domestic dispute.
   Five other defendants convicted by the same federal court jury
also were sentenced by Kehow in separate hearings.
   They were Orlando Cicilia, sentenced to 35 years; Miguel
Ramirez, 25 years; Jose Labrada, 25 years; Eduardo Fernandez
Carduli, 20 years; and Jose (Pepe) Acosta, 20 years.
   Tabraue's father, Guillermo Tabraue, 61, pleaded guilty to
income-tax charges stemming from the drug operation after the jury
could not agree and a mistrial was declared in his case. He is due
for sentencing on May 27.

   Rain fell in Texas, New England and the northern Plains on
Thursday, and mild weather elsewhere in the nation brought water in
another form: flooding snowmelt.
   Southeasterly winds spread moisture from the Gulf of Mexico
across much of central and eastern Texas, where intense downpours
fell in some places. Golfball size hail was reported at Braunig
Lake, Texas.
   A cold front pushed into western New England, bringing scattered
rainshowers. Snowshowers fell from parts of western Pennsylvania
into south-central New York state. Bradford, Pa., received an inch
of snow.
   Rainshowers fell across eastern North Dakota and northwest
Minnesota ahead of a cold front that was slowly sagging into the
region.
   Mild temperatures were reported across much of the nation _ bad
news for people living along swollen rivers.
   The Red River continued to flood in eastern North Dakota and
western Minnesota as melting snow raised its level to as high as 15
feet above flood stage.
   Minor lowland flooding also was reported along the Pearl River
in southeast Louisiana and along the lower Ohio River.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included .56 inch at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas and about a
third of an inch at Kingsville, Mineral Wells and Abilene, Texas.
   Temperatures were in the 50s or 60s across much of the nation,
but in the 40s across much of the Great Lakes and New England and
in the 70s and 80s in parts of the South and Southwest.
   A few cities recorded record low temperatures. The lows included
28 degrees in Asheville, N.C., 36 in Huntsville, Ala., and 20 in
Madison, Wis.
   The low in the nation Thursday morning was 12 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo., and Marquette, Mich.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at Buffalo, N.Y., to 95 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   The National Weather Service forecast for Friday called for
scattered rain from the Great Lakes through the middle Mississippi
Valley, with widespread rainshowers and thunderstorms from the
eastern parts of the southern Plains through the lower Mississippi
Valley and the central Gulf Coast.
   Scattered rain also was expected across the northern half of
Maine. The remainder of the nation was expected to have pleasant,
mild weather.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 60s or 70s across
much of the nation. Highs were forecast in the 50s from the
northern High Plains through the northern Plains and the lower
Great Lakes into much of New England; in the 40s from the upper
Mississippi Valley into the northern Great Lakes and across
northern and coastal parts of New England; in the 80s across the
southern half of Florida and the southern tip of Texas; and into
the 80s and 90s from Oregon through much of California into the
desert Southwest.

   There were some smiles and a few tears
Thursday when officials told a handful of daughters of Confederate
soldiers they would be moved permanently from their home in the
former capital of the Confederacy.
   ``I think it will be best to move. It seems like it will be so
much better, but I love everyone here,'' said 89-year-old Osa Lee
Yates, her voice cracking. She has lived in the Home For
Confederate Women for two decades.
   ``We went up there (to the new home) and looked through it,''
said Miss Yates. ``It was great.
   Beginning May 15, the eight residents will be moved to
Brandermill Woods Active Retirement Center, about 20 miles outside
of Richmond, said Janet Burhans, president and chairman of the
Confederate home's board of managers, which unanimously approved
the move Thursday.
   The 58-year-old home, which is owned by the board but sits on
state land, will go to the state along with much of the furnishings
in exchange for the women's care at the new nursing home.
   Caring for them there will save $160,000 to $170,000 a year,
according to board member Carter Pollard. Mrs. Pollard said the
board had been dipping into its trust fund for $200,000 to $300,000
a year and the fund would have been gone in about five years.
   Bertha Moore, 88, said she enjoys the activities at the home but
added, ``All my friends are going'' to the new facility.
   ``We fold napkins once in a while when they need them,'' she
said. ``We have church on Sunday mornings. On Tuesday, we have
Reverend Graham. He comes and he stays an hour. It's just Bible
study.''
   As visitors milled around, Mary Lynn, 87, sat down at the piano

<HEAD>Rebel Insurgency Claims 59 Lives This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas killed 11 peasants in
raids on two mountain hamlets and one policemen in a separate
attack, officials said Thursday. That bought the insurgency death
toll this week to 59 nationwide.
   More than 690 people were killed in the first three months of
1989, making it one of the bloodiest periods in Lima's nine-year
insurgency, Sen. Enrique Bernales, head of the Senate commission on
violence, told Congress Wednesday night.
   In Lima, police on Thursday reported 305 people were arrested
this week in El Agustino slum in anti-insurgency sweeps. Officials
said most of those arrested had no identification papers and were
held briefly until they could prove their identities.
   The violence fueled opposition charges that President Alan
Garcia's center-left government is losing ground to the rebels and
its anti-insurgency policy is in disarray.
   More than 14,000 people have died in the violent campaign by the
Mao-inspired Shining Path movement to impose Marxist rule. The
uprising began in the impoverished countryside around Ayacucho, 235
miles southeast of Lima.
   Most of the dead have been highland peasants, but thousands of
others _ non-combatants, rebels, police and soldiers _ have also
been slain.
   In the latest violence, a Shining Path column attacked a police
post near Andahuaylas, 72 miles southeast of Ayacucho, around
midnight Wednesday, killing one policeman and wounding three,
police said.
   Shining Path attacks killed 11 peasants Monday in Tantarpata and
Jotapuquio, tiny hamlets located near each other about 60 miles
northeast of Ayacucho, police said.
   Report of the attack was delayed due to the area's remoteness,
they said.
   Also on Monday, troops killed 34 Shining Path guerrillas in
jungle clashes, and on Wednesday rebels killed 12 peasants at
Chongos Alto and a political leader in Huancayo in the highlands.

<HEAD>Washington Researchers Conduct Cold Fusion Experiment</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Fusion-Profits, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two graduate students said Thursday they had
detected indications of cold fusion in an experiment conducted with
heavy water, but they could not get the same results using ordinary
water.
   Van L. Eden and Wei Liu, physics students at the University of
Washington, said they did not duplicate exactly the highly
publicized experiment by University of Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons
and Martin Fleischmann of England's University of Southampton.
   Pons and Fleischmann said they apparently produced nuclear
fusion in a tabletop experiment using ordinary lab equipment.
   But Eden, 28, and Liu, 27, said they did get indications that
fusion may have taken place in their experiment last week.
   In the experiment, a mass spectrometer detected a possible
indicator of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen commonly
produced in fusion reactions.
   The indicator was found when the experiment was run using
deuterium, a hydrogen isotope and component of deuterium oxide or
``heavy water.'' Eden said the indicator was not detected when the
test was repeated with ordinary water.
   The students' results, if confirmed, could help answer a
question raised about the Utah experiment by Harold Furth, director
of plasma physics at Princeton University.
   Furth, at a meeting Wednesday of the American Chemical Society
in Dallas, said that some experts believe the energy detected in
the Utah experiment is actually a chemical reaction that is not
understood.
   But he said if the experiment worked using deuterium oxide but
not ordinary water, it would suggest the reaction actually did
involve some sort of deuterium fusion.
   The students said, however, that they did not detect the
substantial quantities of neutrons expected from a fusion reaction,
although they were not using a particularly sensitive detector for
them.
   For their experiment, the pair used a test tube containing
deuterium oxide in which a palladium electrode and gold wire were
placed and connected to a power source. The palladium electrode was
connected to a vacuum chamber, which in turn was connected to the
mass spectrometer, which detects nuclear particles.
   Pons and Fleischman used a platinum wire instead of gold, and
observed the amount of excess heat produced, rather than observing
tritium particles.
   Eden and Liu cautioned that their results were preliminary and
needed review by other scientists. They also said they had not
ruled out other explanations for what was observed.
   Researchers at Brigham Young University, Texas A&amp;M, Georgia Tech
and Moscow University in the Soviet Union also have found possible
indications of cold fusion, but said their findings need further
testing.
   Fusion, the energy process that powers the sun and the hydrogen
bomb, has been touted as the ultimate energy source if a means
could be found to produce it economically.
   The two students said their major out-of-pocket expense was for
``about three pizzas'' bought by Liu.

<HEAD>Embattled Wright Mounts Emotional Defense of Ethics Charges</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new graf after 4th graf pvs, And a, report completed;

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With his position as the nation's highest
elected Democrat in jeopardy, House Speaker Jim Wright mounted an
emotional defense Thursday against serious ethics charges and
declared he would ``fight to the last ounce of conviction and
energy that I possess.''
   In a carefully scripted 30-minute counteroffensive delivered to
reporters and television cameras, Wright sought to rebut point by
point the charges being lodged against him by the House ethics
committee, which was writing its final report after a 10-month,
$1.5 million investigation of his finances.
   Wright's supporters called the appearance persuasive, but other
Democrats were agonizing over the prospect that their most visible
official might become a political liability and have to be deposed.
   And a member of the ethics panel, Rep. John T. Myers, R-Ind.,
said the speech would have no effect on the committee's
conclusions. ``We have a task to do, and I don't think we'll be
influenced at this point,'' he said.
   The committee completed work on its report late Thursday and
scheduled a news conference Monday morning to release it. The
report will include a statement alleging that Wright violated House
rules in several dozen instances, said a source familiar with the
investigation.
   Flanked by members of his leadership team and Texas colleagues,
Wright's voice choked with emotion as he defended his wife, Betty,
against the charge that her $18,000-a-year salary from a Fort Worth
business partner amounts to an improper gift.
   He said his wife was ``a good decent, caring, thoroughly
honorable person'' and he would ``damn well fight to protect her
honor and integrity from any challenge from any source whatever the
cost.''
   ``Whether I'm speaker of the house, which is the greatest honor
I've ever had, is not important,'' Wright said. ``What is important
is that Congress move swiftly _ and I'm prepared to move very
swiftly _ to get distractive matters of this kind behind us so that
we can concentrate on the really important things that affect this
country of ours.''
   He said his reputation ``is the most important thing and the
only really important thing. For my good name, which is the legacy
I intend to leave my children and my grandchildren, I will fight to
the last ounce of conviction and energy that I possess.''
   Wright declined to field questions after his statement. After
his impassioned public defense, Wright returned to the business of
the House, appearing in the chamber to push for a vote on a $49.7
million Contra aid package.
   Rep. Charles Wilson, who was among the three dozen or so of the
260 House Democrats to attend Wright's speech, said the event
``serves to brace everybody up for a good, hard tough fight.'' But
he added, ``We haven't hit bottom yet.''
   Sources familiar with the deliberations said all crucial votes
already had been taken and had gone against Wright on the two most
serious charges: that he violated House rules by accepting gifts
from a business partner with an interest in legislation, and that
he evaded limits on collecting speaking fees through bulk sales of
his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   One source said the 12-member panel _ evenly divided between
Democrats and Republicans _ had been unanimous in its decision that
Wright's acceptance of use of a car and condominium constituted
unreported gifts, and voted 10-2 to place Mrs. Wright's salary in
that category. The vote also was 10-2 to hold that Wright sought to
evade outside income limits through bulk book sales.
   But on the most potentially serious issue for Wright, whether
Mallick had an interest in legislation, the committee split 8 to 4,
with Democrats Chet Atkins of Massacusetts and Bernard Dwyer of New
Jersey siding with the six Republicans on the panel.
   The committee decisions essentially closed the $1.5 million
investigation and sent the case into a new, more open and more
political phase which could lead to a disciplinary hearing and a
range of punishments.
   The investigation not only jeopardizes Wright's leadership post,
but some lawmakers feared the action also pointed toward a new and
unrealistic standard for congressional conduct. One member of the
ethics committee predicted the decisions would add urgency to a
revamping of House ethics rules now in its early stages.
   Wright began his day Wednesday with a 10-minute, highly personal
speech to his strongest supporters at a closed-door leadership
meeting, and was given a standing ovation, according to
participants. They said his eyes misted as he lamented that his
wife had been drawn into the ethics case. ``I thought his
performance was touching,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.
   Later, the Texas Democrat told reporters: ``There are some
things worth fighting for, and one of them is personal honor and
reputation earned over 66 years of living and giving. And that's
far more precious to me than any public office.''
   Alluding to charges that his wife had done little work for a
salary she was paid by a Fort Worth business partner, Wright added:
``My wife's reputation is very precious to me. And I'm damn well,
darn well, not going to let that be sacrificed.''
   The mood among Democrats was somber. The report is certain to
force difficult political decisions on whether to uphold their
party's most visible official in the face of certain Republican
efforts to capitalize on the alleged ethical shortcomings of the
man who stands behind Vice President Dan Quayle in line of
succession to the White House. No speaker has ever been chased from
office by ethics violations.
   Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., said members wanted to be fair to
both Wright and the House of Representatives. ``I think there's a
deep concern both as to the person of the speaker and the Congress
itself,'' he said. ``There's a lot of agony.''
   During three weeks of deliberations, debate and votes, sources
said the committee decided:
   _That upwards of $100,000 worth of benefits Wright and his wife,
Betty, received from Fort Worth real estate developer George
Mallick amounted to unreported ``gifts.'' The benefits included
Mrs. Wright's $18,000-a-year salary from 1980 through 1984 and free
use of a condominium and a 1979 Cadillac. House rules require
reporting of any gift over $100.
   _That because of his extensive investments in real estate and
oil and gas enterprises, Mallick had ``a direct interest in
legislation before Congress.'' That meant any gifts worth more than
$100 accepted by the Wrights would violate House rules.
   _That on several occasions Wright sold bulk quantities of his
book to organizations to which he had made speeches in lieu of
accepting honoraria. Speaking fees are limited by the rules, while
book royalties are not.
   The next step in the ethics process is for the committee to
issue a formal statement of the allegations against Wright. The
speaker then would have 21 days to present rebuttals and
counter-arguments before the committee determines whether to call
for a disciplinary hearing to decide whether sanctions are
warranted. Sanctions can range from a simple reprimand to expulsion
from the House.

   President Bush will visit Lockerbie, Scotland,
where a Pan Am jumbo jetliner crashed after being blown apart by a
terrorist bomb, an administration source said Thursday.
   Bush plans to stop in Lockerbie on the way back from a NATO
summit in Brussels, Belgium and visits to Italy, England and West
Germany. He is scheduled to leave Washington on May 26 and return
June 1 or 2.
   A White House official said Bush wants to thank the people of
Lockerbie for their help in searching for victims, cleaning up
afterwards and helping relatives after the tragedy.
   The official, declining to be identified, said Bush is
considering the visit but ``it isn't a done deal.'' However,
another source, also speaking anonymously, said Bush would make the
stop.
   A White House survey team already has visited Lockerbie and an
advance team is expected to stop there within the next week for
further planning.
   The bombing of Pan American Wprld Airways Flight 103 last Dec.
21 killed 259 people aboard the plane and 11 on the ground in
Lockerbie.
   Bush recently met at the White House with a delegation of
relatives of victims of the Pan Am flight.
   Lockerbie citizens expressed pleasure at Bush's decision to
visit the town.
   Francis Park, convener of Annandale district council which
includes Lockerbie, said: ``As a former flier himself, I'm sure he
will have a close affinity with everyone involved in the disaster.''
   The local Church of Scotland minister the Rev. Rev James Annand,
who took part in the public memorial service for the victims of the
bombing, said Bush's visit would be an historic occasion for
Lockerbie and for Scotland.
   ``I can understand why he would want to visit the town. I have
been told by Americans that the crash created the biggest shock in
their country since the shooting of President Kennedy,'' Annand
said.

   President Bush has selected Lt. Gen. Ronald L.
Watts to become the next inspector general of the Army, the
Pentagon announced Thursday.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, Watts will succeed Lt. Gen. Henry
Doctor Jr., whom the Pentagon said would retire on Aug. 1 after
more than 35 years of active duty service.
   In the post of inspector general, Watts will oversee the staff
that handles internal audits and investigations of Army programs to
ensure they are conducted properly.
   Watts, 54, is a native of Seneca, Mo., who is currently serving
as the commander of VII Corps, U.S. Army Europe and the Seventh
Army. Doctor, 56, is a native of Oakley, S.C., who has held the
inspector general post since July 1986.

   Heart disease killed champion prizefighter
Sugar Ray Robinson, a spokesman for the county coroner's office
said Thursday.
   Robinson, whose all-around boxing strength and skill led many
ring experts to consider him the world's greatest boxer
pound-for-pound, died Wednesday at the age of 67.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson will preside over Robinson's funeral
service, set for 11 a.m. Wednesday at West Angeles Church of God
and Christ in Los Angeles, said Reve Gibson, Robinson's niece.
   A post-mortem examination showed Robinson died of
arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which coroner's spokesman
Bob Dambacher interpreted as gradual weakening and hardening of the
arteries.
   The five-time middleweight champion also suffered Alzheimer's
disease and diabetes, Dambacher said.
   A public viewing of Robinson's body is scheduled for Monday
evening and Tuesday at the Angeles Funeral Home, Gibson said.
   Robinson, who dominated the ring for a quarter century until his
retirement in 1965, compiled a record of 175-19-6, including 110
knockouts.
   Besides his wife, Millie, Robinson is survived by a son from an
earlier marriage, Ray Jr., two stepchildren _ Ramona Lewis and
Butch Robinson _ four grandchildren and a sister, Evelyn Nelson of
New York.

   A smoky fire chased hundreds of patrons from
the county Museum of Art on Thursday, but apparently did little
damage and spared a traveling exhibit of works by American painter
Georgia O'Keefe.
   The fire, reported at 12:56 p.m., was confined to a basement
hallway in the three-year-old Robert O. Anderson Building, one of
the museum's five halls, said city Assistant Fire Chief Jim Young.
   Smoke permeated the five-story building, and museum experts were
trying to assess possible damage to artworks after the flames were
doused at 1:19 p.m., he said. One firefighter suffered minor burns.
   The display of 120 O'Keefe paintings was in an adjoining
building and was untouched by smoke, authorities said. The popular
exhibit has been turning away patrons every day since it opened on
March 30th.
   The fire gutted a basement hallway used to store files and other
material, but the flames didn't reach galleries in the Anderson
building housing modern art, Young said.
   Patrons were evacuated by museum staff, Young said, adding that
120 were counted leaving the Anderson building and similar numbers
were assumed to have fled the other galleries. People were allowed
to return to all but the Anderson building about 3:15 p.m.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the Securities
and Exchange Commission settled a huge civil fraud case Thursday
that will put the junk-bond giant under close federal scrutiny for
three years.
   Drexel also agreed to sever its ties with financier Michael
Milken, who was indicted on racketeering charges last month.
   And the company announced that John Shad, a former SEC chief
instrumental in starting an intense investigation more than two
years ago that led to the fraud charges, would become its chairman.
   The Drexel-SEC pact clears the way for Drexel's previously
announced agreement to plead guilty to criminal fraud charges and
pay $650 million in fines and restitution to settle another case
with the Justice Department.
   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm has been the biggest
target of a federal crackdown on securities fraud stemming from the
Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal. Boesky, a notorious speculator
now in federal prison, has been a leading source of evidence
against Drexel, Milken and others.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder called the settlement ``the most
far-reaching relief ever obtained by the commission against a major
regulated entity.''
   ``We think it achieves everything that's needed for the
protection of the investing public,'' SEC Enforcement Director Gary
Lynch said. ``It will also give us the ability to bring other
people to justice that might not be brought to justice if we had
stayed at war for another three to five years.''
   Drexel said in a summary of the agreement that it was paying the
largest penalties ever in a securities case and making
``comprehensive and unprecedented structural changes.''
   ``Today's agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
caps more than two difficult years for the firm and positions
Drexel Burnham Lambert to move forward and fully devote our
energies to our clients' needs,'' Drexel said in a statement.
   ``As a financial institution, we know that our employees,
clients and creditors ... must have total confidence in our
integrity,'' Drexel Chief Executive Frederick Joseph said in the
statement.
   Under the settlement, Drexel will ``disassociate'' itself from
Milken, whose pioneering marketing of high-yield securities
commonly known as junk bonds vaulted Drexel into the forefront of
1980s financial powerhouses. Drexel also agreed to either fire
Milken's brother Lowell, a senior aide, or put him on leave.
   The company and its employees are barred from entering into any
private business deals directly or indirectly with Milken. Current
partnerships with Milken _ such as ownership of Drexel's Beverly
Hills, Calif., junk bond headquarters _ do not have to be dissolved.
   Drexel also will pay $15 million in civil penalties, an amount
already accounted for under the total $650 million in penalties it
already had agreed to pay the government.
   Drexel reached the settlement without admitting or denying
guilt. Admitting guilt would have made the firm more vulnerable to
private lawsuits by investors who claim they were defrauded.
   The SEC said in a statement it also had reached a settlement
with Cary Maultasch, a former Drexel employee who was named in the
case and reportedly emerged as an important cooperating witness.
   The 184-page SEC complaint, filed in September, detailed 21
alleged fraud schemes between 1984 and late 1986 portraying Drexel,
Michael Milken and others as systematic cheaters who engaged in
stock manipulation and insider trading.
   Under terms of the settlement:
   _Drexel will appoint a ``special reviewer'' to oversee its
investment-company-related operations.
   _Drexel agrees to be placed on administrative probation for
three years, meaning the SEC will give the firm's operations
special scrutiny during that period.
   _The SEC and an independent accounting firm to be picked by the
SEC will monitor Drexel's junk bond activities for three years.
   _Drexel will move its equity and convertible securities trading
functions from Beverly Hills, Calif., to New York.
   _Drexel's junk bond operation will remain in Beverly Hills but
will be overseen by a member of a special committee.
   _Drexel will create a committee to oversee internal functions of
Drexel. A majority of the members of the committee will be outside
directors of the firm.
   _The SEC will have a say in who becomes Drexel's chairman for a
period of three years.
   _Drexel will purchase Michael Milken's equity interest in the
investment firm and, if Lowell Milken is no longer employed by
Drexel, it will purchase his equity interest as well.
   _Drexel will add three independent directors to the firm, who
will oversee internal controls and audit, accounting and compliance
and serve as a disciplinary committee.
   Shad will count as one of the independent directors. The other
two will be Roderick Hills, also a former SEC chairman, who is
chairman of Manchester Group Ltd.; and Ralph Saul, a former
president of the American Stock Exchange and former Cigna Corp.
chairman, who is chairman of Peers &amp; Co.
   Negotiations between Drexel and the SEC began in January but
snagged repeatedly on several issues concering the future of the
Milkens.
   It appeared that the 98-count racketeering and fraud indictment
of the Milkens on March 29 helped clear the way for the pact. Both
Milkens pleaded innocent last week.

<TEXT>
   Congress overwhelmingly approved on Thursday a
compromise $49.7 million package of non-military aid for the
Nicaraguan Contras, giving President Bush a chance to forge a
bipartisan policy on Central America.
   The Senate completed congressional action on the measure,
approving the aid package on an 89-9 roll call vote.
   The House earlier endorsed the paln, 309-110. Voting yes were
152 Democrats and 157 Republicans. Voting no were 99 Democrats and
11 Republicans.
   The congressional action represents an effort to declare a truce
in the bitter, years-old fight between the White House and Congress
over aid to the Contras and bring pressure on Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government to keep its promises to allow free elections
and democratic reform.
   ``This bill tries to set in motion a united, single-voice
policy,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas moments before the
chamber voted.
   ``It ends military involvement and covert efforts to overthrow
governments in our hemisphere,'' Wright said.
   At the same time, he added, ``It says to Nicaragua that we are
very earnest about you fulfilling these commitments that you made
to internal democratization.''
   In the Senate, supporters of the bipartisan agreement voted down
a series of amendments aimed at altering or scuttling a plan they
said has the potential to usher in an era of cooperation between
the executive and legislative branches of government on Central
American policy.
   ``If this accord is circumvented or exploited, it would be an
enormous blow to the chances for bipartisan cooperation in a broad
range of areas,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Democratic floor
manager of the Contra-aid package.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Wash., who has voted against all other
proposals to aid the Contras, said he decided to vote for the
compromise plan after concluding that ``simply abandoning them
because they have become a political embarrassment would be as
immoral as the policy we were pursuing.''
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., one of the Senate's strongest
supporters of the Contras, called the Bush administration's plan
``little more than beans and bandaids.''
   ``My administration ... sought the least common denominator,''
Helms said. ``This is not a bipartisan accord. It is an accord that
suited the other side.''
   In the Senate, voting against the measure were Sens. Brock

Cranston, D-Calif.; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa;

R-Wyo. Not voting were Sens. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn. and David
Durenberger, R-Minn.
   ``I think we made a step in the right direction,'' said Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas after the Senate vote. ``Now
we can be an active player in that part of the world. If it doesn't
work we can come back and try it again.''
   The compromise plan, reached after more than two months of
negotiations, would provide at least a temporary truce in the war
that has been waged between the White House and Capitol Hill since
then-President Reagan moved in 1981 to arm the Contras as a force
to battle Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Indeed, many of the suspicions and much of the distrust that
characterized past debates over aid to the Contras were still
visible as both chambers opened debate Thursday.
   Some members clung to hopes more arms could be sent to the
Contras; others said all forms of aid, logistical as well as
military, should be ended.
   The compromise plan would give the Contras food, clothing and
medical assistance to sustain them through next February. But it
would bar aid for weapons and ammunition to renew the guerrillas'
fight against the government.
   Supporters of the compromise said it would put the Sandinista
leadership under intense international pressure to keep their
promises, permit free and fair national elections next February,
and observe the other ``deadlines for democracy'' set by agreements
among Central American presidents over the last two years.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, urged
Republicans not to offer amendments, which he said could upset the
delicate balance represented by the compromise plan.
   ``President Bush telephoned me this morning, urged me to move
this legislation promptly ... and made clear his opposition to any
amendments to the legislation,'' Mitchell said.
   He asked that ``the president's urgent desire for this
legislation be taken into account by members of his own party.''
   As debate opened on the House floor, Republican Leader Bob
Michel of Illinois, supporting the agreement, told his colleagues
that what it ``lacks in perfection it makes up in real effective
help for the cause of progress and democracy in Nicaragua and
Central America.''
   ``I wish we could do better but as legislators it's not given to
us to act only when conditions are perfect,'' Michel said.
   But Rep. Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., said continued support of any
kind for the Contras would derail the diplomatic peace process,
keep the Contras in place as a fighting force and and not integrate
them into Nicaraguan society.
   ``This accord hinges on winks, nods and handshakes,'' he said.
``I'd really like to say I trust this new administration, the Bush
administration, for reintegration of the Contras. But how can I
when I read ... that then-Vice President Bush played a role in
supplying covert aid to the Contras?''
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a longstanding Contra supporter, said
he would go along with the compromise.
   ``I support this bill on the theory that if you can't get
dinner, take a sandwich and keep hope alive,'' Hyde said.
   ``It's a crow sandwich,'' replied Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a
consistent Contra aid opponent.
   ``My problem is that price of crow has gone up. We're paying too
much here to allow the architects of a disastrous Contra policy to
save face.''
   Although the aid funds are to be approved through February,
Congress would be given an opportunity in November to review the
situation and halt the aid if it sees fit.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was
transferred Wednesday from St. Francis Medical Center's intensive
care unit to its telemetry unit, which monitors heart patients, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   Marcos, 71, was listed in guarded condition early Wednesday,
hospital spokeswoman Norma Kop said. He has been hospitalized since
Jan. 15 for treatment of heart and respiratory ailments.
   ``His condition hasn't really changed, but we're trying to free
up a room in ICU for a patient who may need it more,'' she said.
   The telemetry unit provides for monitoring heart patients, but
less acute care than the intensive care unit.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, 59, are under indictment on federal
racketeering charges accusing them of stealing more than $100
million from their homeland and stashing it in the United States.
   U.S. prosecutors have conceded that Marcos is too ill to stand
trial and have temporarily severed him from the case, but the
government is proceeding with the case against Mrs. Marcos.
   The ousted leader has more than $250,000 in unpaid bills at the
hospital. Mrs. Marcos claims the U.S. government should pay the
bills and that she is financially unable to do so.
   The Marcoses came here in February 1986 after their ouster in a
popular revolt that catapulted Corazon Aquino to power, ending
Marcos' 20-year rule.

<TEXT>
   The tedious task of scrubbing clean the
coastline and corraling remaining Exxon Valdez oil blotches
continued Thursday as a light sheen splashed islands at the
entrance to giant Cook Inlet.
   ``It'll probably splatter them, but we're not expecting too much
damage,'' said Hal Alabaster, spokesman for the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration. ``We're having trouble estimating
what's going on out there because the currents are so tricky.''
   The leading edge of the spill, sighted west of Gore Point on the
Kenai Peninsula, continues to break up, said Coast Guard spokesman
Roy Compton. Gore Point is about 25 miles from the entrance to the
Cook Inlet, which leads to fishing towns such as Kodiak and Homer,
and even to Anchorage.
   The oil has not been seen in Cook Inlet, Alabaster said.
   In Prince William Sound, crews of workers continued to clean
islands, where tides have begun to wash from light sheen off the
beaches.
   ``That's favorable,'' Compton said. ``It gives them more of a
chance to recover the oil.''
   The shoreline was covered in oil following the March 24
grounding of the Exxon tanker, which sent 10.1 million gallons of
oil into the sound. More than 840,000 gallons has been recovered,
about 8 percent of the spilled oil.
   Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost arrived in Valdez to take
charge of the cleanup effort.
   After flying over the area, Yost said he could see a marked
improvement since he visited to assess the spill for President Bush
two weeks ago.
   ``Things are getting better, and we're going to do everything we
can to expedite the cleanup,'' said Yost. ``It is important not to
forget that we have a long-term cleanup _ not days or weeks, but
probably for months.''
   Yost said he has given Exxon until Saturday to come up with a
plan for beach cleanup, including the number of personnel and
logistical support.
   ``I'm not in a happy relationship with Exxon,'' Yost said. ``I'm
here to oversee what they're doing, and I have some marching orders
from the president of the United States.''
   The National Transportation Safety Board announced it will hold
four days of public hearings beginning May 16 in Anchorage.
   ``The board's investigation will center on determining the
probable cause of the accident,'' said board member Lee Dickinson.
``While we will be examining initial emergency response efforts, we
will not be assessing the environmental issues raised by the
accident.''
   Spokeswoman Drucella Andersen said the agency expects to call
about 20 witnesses to talk about the nation's worst oil spill.
   Winds were generally out of the northeast Thursday, meaning they
could help push oil away from land, but the forecast called for a
wind shift to the southeast, increasing to 35 knots with a gale
warning, the Coast Guard said. Seas were forecast to increase to 9
feet in the Gulf of Alaska by Friday.
   Exxon-paid cleanup workers have filled hundreds of bags a day
with thick crude oil and gravel on Naked Island. About 100 workers
in oil-splattered yellow slickers were on the shoreline, mostly
scraping the crud off rocks with their hands.
   They call it rock waxing.
   ``I've been working with another fellow and we've packed at
least 100 gallons of the oil on this beach. For scooping it out of
the rocks that's pretty good. It makes a difference, out of 10
million,'' said Dean Carl, a wood boat refinisher from Valdez.
   ``This is a priority affair. We're doing good enough that every
day it's harder to find oil to pick up. That means something.''
   Workers are on the boats in Valdez at 6 a.m., ride for three
hours to the island and get back on the boat at about 4 p.m. after
seven hours of work. When converted cruise ships and sleeping
barges _ dubbed ``floatels'' _ are in place, the workday will be 12
to 14 hours because travel time to the islands will be eliminated.
   The state has identified 3,000 pieces of shoreline it hopes to
clean by the rainy season in late August. Only 44 are ready for
clean-up, said Department of Environmental Conservation
Commissioner Dennis Kelso.
   ``We have a fairly short opportunity to finish this before the
weather changes,'' Kelso said.
   At the Kenai Fjords National Park, light oil sheen has
splattered some outer islands, and tar balls have reached some
shoreline, but no significant damage is reported.
   ``The tips of the peninsula have been slimed for the past couple
of days, but the worst that could have happened hasn't happened
yet,'' said Jon Erickson, a park spokesman.
   Fishing towns along the coast have spent four tense days waiting
for the oil to hit land. Officials said that until all oil has
broken up and swept to sea, changes in the weather could still
throw crude ashore.
   Aerial surveys earlier showed significantly less oil on the
water, the result of earlier high wind and rough seas.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced
Thursday that Exxon made a $15 million down payment for the cost of
assessing the spill's long-term impact on Alaska's natural
resources.
   Administrator William Evans said the money would go toward costs
incurred by his agency, and for years of research into the effects
of the oil on sealife and animals in the region.
   ``NOAA's going to have a team here for a very long time,'' Evans
said.
   He said the focus of the research would be on what steps will be
necessary to restore or replace the fisheries and other natural
resoucres affected by the spill.
   The announcement came one day after Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan complained in Washington that Exxon was dragging its feet in
providing ``up-front money'' for the planning process.
   Holland America-Westours Inc., the state's largest cruise
operator, announced it was contributing $100,000 to volunteer
efforts to save wildlife and will spend $1 million in television
commercials to reassure tourists that most of Alaska was not
affected by the spill.
   Thousands of sea birds and otters have died as result of the oil
slick, which coats fur and feathers with a poisonous goop that
prevents the animals from staying warm and bouyant.
   Biologists have recovered 150 dead otters. Fifty-four of 113
others being treated at a rescue center have died. So far, 1,242
dead birds have been found along the coast, 227 birds have been
rescued for treatment; 87 of those have died and nine have been
released.
   The herring fishery season set for this weekend in the Kodiak
area will go on as scheduled, officials said, but fish will be
tested for contamination.

<HEAD>Ceasescu Says All Romanian Foreign Debt Repaid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Nicolae Ceausescu announced
Wednesday that as of March 31 communist Romania had repaid all its
foreign debt, the Romanian state news agency Agerpres reported.
   In 1981, Romania's foreign debt totaled about $11 billion, but
the Bucharest government stopped almost all imports of Western
machinery and stepped up food exports for hard currency at the
expense of serious food shortages at home.
   By the end of 1988, Romania's foreign debt had dropped to about
$2 billion.
   There have been no indications, however, that authorities will
raise living standards by importing badly needed consumer goods.
   Hard currency earnings are badly need to buy Western machinery
and equipment to modernize mostly outdated industrial
installations. Most available resources probably will be used for
that purpose.
   Ceasescu runs the most repressive nation in the Soviet bloc, and
his efforts to rid it of foreign debt left Romania financially
strapped, with food and power shortages further reducing a poor
standard of living.
   The president's announcement came at the opening of a three-day
session of the Romanian Communist Party's policy-setting Central
Committee.
   ``I wish to inform the plenary meeting, the entire party and our
entire people that at the end of March Romania fully paid back its
foreign debt,'' Agerpress quoted Ceausescu as saying.
   ``This is the outstanding result of our people's work devoted to
the country's socio-economic development. It proves the might of
the Romanian socialist economy and opens wonderful prospects for
implementation of the party program of building the multilaterally
developed socialist society and Romania's advance to communism.''
   Agerpres said Ceausescu on Wednesday received a group of U.S.
business people representing over 50 companies that have trade
relations with Romania.
   Romania was deprived of Most Favored Nation trading status on
the U.S. market last year because of its record on human rights.
   If accorded the privilege, Romania would get the same terms as
those granted now or in the future to any other nation.
   Ceasescu referred to the issue in his meeting with the
Americans, saying ``There is only one problem awaiting an
appropriate solution, that is to apply the 1975 economic accord
which also provides for the mutual granting of the Most Favored
Nation clause unconditionally on either side.''
   Ceausescu said he would like to see two-way trade between the
United States and Romania reach the $2 billion mark annually,
Agerpres reported. He did not give the current figure.

<HEAD>Rome Formally Ends Review Of Hunthausen's Ministry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 5{-year Vatican review of Seattle's archbishop
who has come under fire from conservative Roman Catholics has
ended, the pope's U.S. representative announced Tuesday.
   A special three-member oversight commission that looked at
Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen's ministry ``is completed and its
mandate terminated,'' said Archbishop Pio Laghi, Pope John Paul
II's delegate to the United States.
   In a two-paragraph statement issued in Washington, D.C., Laghi
said Hunthausen ``has indicated that he, along with Coadjutor
Archbishop Thomas J. Murphy, will continue to address the issues
which have been of concern to the Church.''
   Hunthausen responded: ``I am grateful for the announcement by
Archbishop Laghi of the closure of the work of the apostolic
commission.
   ``Both Archbishop Murphy and I acknowledge the trial the church
here has faced over the past several years, yet we are also able to
view the whole experience as a time of grace, a grace which, with
the Lord's help, will enable us to offer our leadership to the
church in Western Washington in the years ahead.''
   Hunthausen, 67, said after a trip to Rome earlier this year that
he had been assured the review of his work in the Seattle Roman
Catholic Archdiocese had been completed, and that the apostolic
commission, chaired by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, would
be dissolved.
   The commission, which also included Cardinal John O'Connor of
New York and Archbishop John Quinn of San Francisco, was set up in
January 1987 to review Hunthausen's ministry. The Vatican has kept
close watch on Hunthausen since November 1983 after some
conservative Catholics criticized the archbishop.
   In a move that outraged many U.S. Catholics, the Vatican in 1985
removed Hunthausen's authority in five areas, including ministry to
homosexuals, some liturgical matters and the tribunal that decides
marriage annulments.
   Hunthausen had been criticized for being lax in those areas and
an auxiliary bishop, Donald Wuerl, was appointed to take over those
duties.
   When that situation proved unworkable, Hunthausen's authority
was restored in early 1987, Wuerl was transferred, and Murphy, a
bishop in Montana, was named coadjutor. The commission was also
named to advise Hunthausen.
   The commission met with Hunthausen five times, most recently in
October.
   Tuesday's announcement was praised by Sister Kathleen Pruitt, an
outspoken supporter of Hunthausen, and the director of mission and
outreach for the Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace.
   She said Hunthausen has not significantly changed his leadership
since the Vatican investigation.
   ``I'm sure some things have changed, not major things,'' said
Margaret Hoffman, director of the Sons of St. Peter Coalition, a
conservative group critical of the archbishop's leadership.
   Ms. Hoffman said liturgical abuses still occur in the
archdiocese and cited Hunthausen washing a woman's feet last month
in a Holy Week ritual. She said church teachings forbid washing a
woman's feet in the manner reminiscent of Jesus washing his
disciples' feet.

   Physicists popped champagne corks after a $125 million atom
smasher made its first Z particle, a milestone in the quest to
``understand what's in the mind of God'' by studying the birth of
the universe and the makeup of matter.
   ``I'm happy, with relief and joy,'' said Burton Richter, 1976
Nobel laureate in physics and director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, 30 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   Richter said scientists drank champagne Wednesday after
confirming one Z particle was produced Tuesday by the 3-mile-long
Stanford Linear Collider after an almost two-year delay.
   Alan Weinstein, a physicist at California Institute of
Technology, said the collider should help physicists inch toward
their ultimate goal of developing a ``theory of everything'' _ a
simple theory that would explain all the particles and four
fundamental forces of nature. Many scientists believe the four
forces are simply different forms of a single force that existed at
the beginning of time.

   An estimated 2.5 million people in North and South
America already are infected with the AIDS virus, and some parts of
the hemisphere may be facing ``a massive epidemic,'' doctors warned
today.
   The researchers said the AIDS epidemic in some Latin and
Caribbean nations may become as bad as the outbreak in Africa,
although the severity will vary from country to country.
   Their concern, expressed in an editorial in today's New England
Journal of Medicine, is based in part on the apparent spread of the
disease from homosexuals to heterosexuals. This shift will put far
more people at risk of the deadly disease.
   The World Health Organization estimates that at least 5 million
people worldwide are infected with the virus and 350,000 have
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

   Crews went on the offensive against the
worst U.S. oil spill, but communities down the coast were on the
defensive as meandering slicks neared one of the world's most
populous bird breeding grounds.
   ``We are beginning a new phase,'' Department of Environmental
Conservation Commissioner Dennis Kelso said Wednesday as fishermen
were redeployed from protecting fish hatcheries to begin the long,
tedious work of collecting oil from coves and inlets.
   Crews were on the beaches of Naked Island in the heart of Prince
William Sound, scooping up pools of congealed oil and scraping it
from rocks. The shoreline was covered in oil following the March 24
grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez, which sent 10 million gallons
of oil into the sound.

   Beachgoers insert the change in the slot of a Polynesian-looking

eight or 15, then move a wand over themselves as the machine
squirts out a mist of suntan lotion.
   ``Each application is 40 seconds, which is ample time to spray

<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only obvious explanation for NBC's
three-part miniseries ``Around the World in 80 Days'' is that it's
some kind of public works project for out-of-work actors.
   No other reason could exist for such a tedious remake of the
1956 movie that was rather silly at the time and succeeded only
because audiences of 33 years ago were easily impressed by
spectacle, or were at least amused by picking out the 40-plus major
stars who appeared in cameos.
   In 1956, it was hard enough to relate to the Jules Verne story,
hinging on the 19th-century preposterousness of Phileas Fogg's
assertion that he could traverse the globe in 80 days. It's even
harder in the age of the supersonic jet.
   This version, airing Sunday through Tuesday, outdoes the
original only by being twice as long.
   It seems NBC is still trying to repay poor Pierce Brosnan for
holding him to his ``Remington Steele'' contract and preventing him
from becoming the next James Bond in the movies. One more
miniseries like this or last season's ``James Clavell's Noble
House'' and Brosnan won't have a career to worry about. His
stick-figure Phileas Fogg is fine for the set-up of the movie, when
Fogg is presented as a tedious bore, but the role requires him to
loosen up eventually. Brosnan never does.
   Co-star Eric Idle, one member of the cast who has a regular gig,
NBC's midseason replacement comedy ``Nearly Departed,'' plays
Fogg's valet, Jean Passepartout. Idle does a flimsy imitation of
Peter Sellers' French accent from ``The Pink Panther.'' It is more
irritating than amusing.
   Peter Ustinov, who doesn't appear to be a refugee from any other
NBC shows, is barely discernible under bluster and makeup as
Detective Fix, a floundering nincompoop who is trying to arrest
Fogg for robbing a bank. The script's meager attempts to make him
sympathetic fail.
   Julia Nickson, another survivor of NBC's ``Noble House,'' plays
an Indian princess who falls in love with Phileas and is dragged
along for the ride. Her other NBC connection is that her husband is
David Soul, star of ``Unsub.''
   The 1956 version starred David Niven, Cantinflas and Shirley
MacLaine. It was an entertainment extravaganza when big-budget
spectacles were uncommon. The impressive list of cameos included
Marlene Dietrich, Ronald Colman, Noel Coward, Peter Lorre, Hermione
Gingold, George Raft, Gilbert Roland and Frank Sinatra, among many
others. Compare to this year's list, which includes Henry Gibson,
John Hillerman, Jack Klugman, Darren McGavin, Pernell Roberts,
James B. Sikking, Jill St. John and Robert Wagner. How low have we
sunk? Robert Morley, interestingly enough, appears in both versions.
   This one was filmed in England, Macao, Hong Kong, Thailand and
Yugoslavia in 12 weeks. As inthe original, the endless scenes of
boats and trains soon become indistinguishable.
   In Part 1, someone robs the Bank of England, Phileas hires
Passepartout, then bets a colleague that he can go around the globe
and return to that same spot within 80 days. On the way to Paris,
he and Passepartout run into Sarah Bernhardt (Lee Remick), catch a
ride on a hot-air balloon, crash-land in the Coliseum, board a
steamship for Bombay, meet Sir Francis Commarty (Hillerman), board
a train to Calcutta that runs out of track, purchase an elephant
and find the princess (Nickson) about to be burned on her husband's
funeral pyre.
   In Part 2, Phileas and Passepartout rescue the princess, proceed
to Calcutta, board a steamer for Hong Kong, meet a Burmese prince,
get captured by bandits, help free the Burmese prince, thereby
improving England-Burma relations, then lose Passepartout on a boat
to Yokohama. Another couple (St. John and Wagner) are arrested in
place of Fogg and the princess, who board another ship along with
Detective Fix. The ship is swamped at sea, but Fogg, the princess
and Fix escape in a lifeboat. They reach Yokohama, where they find
Passepartout performing in a circus.
   In Part 3, everyone in England is convinced that Fogg has been
lost at sea, but he and the others board a ship for San Francisco.
In the Wild West, they encounter Jesse James (Stephen Nichols),
escape Indian attack and finally reach New York, but miss the boat
to Liverpool and hijack another. When Fogg reaches England, Fix
arrests him and Fogg's chance at winning his bet seems to be lost.
   Of course, it isn't. But anyone who has stuck through this thing
this far will have lost six hours that could have been much better
spent doing something else.

<HEAD>The Poor Excuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposal to lower capital gains
taxes may be in for some rough times in Congress, because opponents
view it as a sop to the rich rather than a means of raising tax
revenue.
   The conclusions of politicians often vary widely from those of
economists, so the conflict isn't unusual. Political decisions
often make bad economics and bad economics often have strong
political backing.
   What is unusual is that some of those who see only benefits to
the rich in a lower capital gains tax are the same ones who see a
threat to poorer folks in another proposal: Limiting the
deductibility of interest on home mortgages.
   As that law reads, a homeowner is entitled to deduct interest on
mortgages totaling $1 million, a level which obviously excludes
lower and middle-income homeowners. Only the wealthy could attempt
or afford to borrow that much money.
   In contrast, hard-working, middle-income families who have
invested or saved small sums for long periods of time _ denying
themselves in order to meet long-term goals _ could benefit
enormously from a capital gains tax cut.
   Nevertheless, respected members of Congress, such as Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
defend the $1 million ceiling as a threat to the poor while
opposing a tax cut as a gift to the rich.
   The most popular rationales for the apparent inconsistencies
include these:
   _If you lower the $1 million ceiling on home-mortgage
deductibility you open the door to more cuts. Said a real estate
spokesman: ``All it takes is a pen (for Congress) to scratch out
one zero and $1 million goes to $100,000.''
   Therefore, it is argued, a stand must be taken at $1 million;
otherwise, the poorer households are indeed endangered, if not
immediately then in the future. Congress, it is said, might even be
tempted to erase the deduction.
   For this reason, say Realtors, Rostenkowski has assured them
that as long as he remains chairman of Ways and Means the ceiling
will remain where it is.
   _While recent history shows that reductions in capital gains
taxes can lead to much higher revenues _ because people feel freer
to cash in long-term investments such as homes or stocks at lower
rates _ some studies suggest only minimal revenue gains.
   Such are the ingredients of political disagreements.
   Somehow lost in the oratory, however, is the very basis for the
arguments: The rich versus the poor _ the contention that the poor
must be saved even if the rich are denied. A noble stance, perhaps,
but is it straightforward?
   Assume an investment of $5,000 in stocks, held for seven years.
If the appreciation averages 10 percent a year you will have
approximately doubled your money. Your capital gains would be
$5,000, your tax $1,400.
   But, while you appeared to have earned 10 percent, your real
gain was only 6 percent a year because of inflation. At 6 percent
your money won't double in seven years; it will grow to only $7,000
or so. Your taxes remain at $1,400.
   After taxes, your investment, therefore, is only about $5,600,
an average gain of $100 a year for having denied yourself the use
of the money and, in fact, put it at risk.
   Because your capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, what if
your investment lost money, thereby lowering your income? Would you
be able to claim a lower tax base? No. Gains count, losses don't.

<HEAD>In This Company Town, There's a Lot of Voluntary Overtime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire drill emptied the Interstate Commerce
Commission building a few weeks ago, sending hundreds of
bureaucrats onto Constitution Avenue. What caught a passerby's eye
was that they kept asking the guards when they could get back to
their desks.
   When the all-clear sounded, they stormed the place.
   Government lawyer Kristina Nygaard says she generally carries a
briefcase home and spends a few hours after supper with papers
spread out on the dining room table, working on hydroelectric plant
licenses for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
   In this company town, there's a lot of voluntary, unpaid
overtime. Exceptions can be found, of course, but many of the
political appointees and high-level careerists _ the people who
really run the government _ are a hard-working bunch.
   Often, a package of crackers and a soft drink at the desk serves
as lunch and the real work gets done at the tail end of the day.
   That flies in the face of the stereotype of ``bureaucrats'' as
surly, officious paper shufflers, just putting in their time. In
fact, some research finds that most Americans are actually
satisfied with their face-to-face contacts with government workers.
   Most government people, like workers everywhere, do a day's
work, then leave at quitting time. Government personnel officials
say they are about as productive as other workers.
   But closer to the top, among the 5,000 or so senior executives
of government, are many who are on the job early and late.
   Helmut Hellwig, who is with the National Institute of Standards
and Technology, says he leaves home at 6:30 a.m., leaves work at
7:30 p.m. and when he goes in on weekends to put in a few quiet
hours he is rarely the only one to show up.
   Another government worker is Harry A. Blackmun, 80, associate
justice of the Supreme Court.
   Hear him describe his work habits: ``The job for me is really
seven days a week. You can say my average work week exceeds 60
hours. It's a rare Saturday that I miss coming to the court. ... I
try to avoid coming in on Sundays, but I will work at home.''
   On Saturdays, the president may be at Camp David, but hundreds
of his minions are laboring away.
   Like many agencies, the IRS requires employees to sign in if
they enter the building during weekends. Sign-in sheets show that
on average, 500 people put in some extra time at their desks on
Saturdays and about the same number on Sundays. In all, 6,300
people work at IRS headquarters.
   Last fall, when 4.5 million copies of ``Your Federal Income
Taxes'' were printed, IRS people involved in its preparation
travelled to the printing plant in New Jersey, worked weekends, and
even through Thanksgiving, reports the agency's public affairs
director, Ellen Murphy.
   ``It's hard to generalize, but I would certainly say government
people are very hard workers,'' says business executive Alan
Campbell, who ran the Office of Personnel Management in the Carter
administration.
   Adds Donald Devine, who held that job under President Reagan:
``At the top of government, by and large, people work harder than
they do in the private sector.'' He says the ``work culture''
varies from one agency to another, with the hardest working people,
in his view, found at the Pentagon and other defense-related
agencies and at the IRS, FBI and Customs Service.
   One reason the day is so long for government executives:
Meetings. The boss, his deputies and his agency heads spend much of
their time in meetings. That leaves the end of the day for reading
the mail, returning phone calls, thinking about tomorrow and, if
there's time, about the Big Picture.
   Mark A. Abramson, who runs the Center for Excellence in
Government, which is sort of an alumni association of 400
ex-government executives, is a student of the subject.
   ``In government,'' he says, ``there are more people you have to
get agreement from. You can't do anything unilaterally. There are
so many actors and so many bases to get touched. The first time you
forget to call an interest group and tell them what you're planning
to do, you get creamed.''
   Once a policy emerges from all those meetings, it has to be sold
within the agency, to the chief, to other agencies that will be
affected, to the budget people, to Congress and to the interested
publics. More meetings.
   Moreover, the person going to all those meetings must still
manage his own little bureaucracy. He has to get the staff's input
before a meeting, then brief the staff afterward so all march in
the same direction.
   ``Political people often talk about their input _ `I work 16
hours a day'; `I work 17 and weekends' _ because there is no bottom
line, no profit or loss in government, so they can't talk about
their output,'' says Abramson.
   On Capitol Hill, congressional aides, often young, single and
dedicated, work long hours and then walk down the block to the Hawk
&amp; Dove, Bullfeathers, the Tune Inn or some such place to spend half
the night socializing with the very same people they spent their
day with and talking about _ what else? _ work.
   Ask officialdom about work habits, and Joseph Califano's name is
likely to pop up. When he ran the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare under President Carter he was a legendary workaholic _
despite Carter's admonition to aides that he didn't want government
to keep them from being good family men and women.
   Califano was famous for calling a staff meeting for 7 p.m.,
which might not get started until 8 or 9 and not end before 11.
   ``He was a hard-driving guy who wanted to do a lot and do it
quickly and who expected people to be available when he wanted
them,'' recalls Dan Marcus, Califano's deputy general counsel.
Califano installed lights on assistants' phones to summon them,
right away, now.
   ``In those kinds of positions, the responsibilities are heady,
the issues are interesting and you usually would come into those
jobs with a fairly high level of enthusiasm and drive,'' says
Marcus.

<HEAD>Bush Acknowledges Evolving Position on Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush freely admits he has varied his
position on abortion over the years, leading up to his outright
call for repeal of the landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing
the procedure.
   But even in the steadily ``evolving'' position that Bush
describes, the president would still permit three exceptions to a
ban, allowing an abortion to save a mother's life and in cases of
rape and incest.
   As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments April 26 in a
Missouri case that could lead to the reversal _ or substantial
weakening _ of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, Bush's position is
clear. He wants the decision reversed, thinks the issue ought to be
returned to the states and favors a pro-life constitutional
amendment.
   His position wasn't always so clear.
   In the 1980 presidential campaign, Bush said he would accept
abortion to save the mother's life and in cases of rape and incest.
But when Ronald Reagan picked him as a running mate, Bush sought to
minimize the differences they had on the issue. Reagan has
steadfastly opposed abortion except to save the life of the mother.
   ``Please do not keep reminding me of the differences we had,''
he told reporters at a news conference he and Reagan had after
accepting the nomination.
   Seven years later, when he started campaigning for the 1988
Republican presidential nomination, Bush talked anew of the three
instances in which he would accept abortion.
   Asked at a town meeting in Iowa to state his position, Bush said
succinctly: ``Oppose abortion. Oppose federal funding for abortion.
Want to see Roe vs. Wade changed so it won't legalize abortion.''
   During the general election campaign, he seldom broached the
volatile issue, and when asked about it, Bush often would say
tersely, ``I'm for adoption, not abortion.''
   But he got caught up in the issue again during a debate last
September with Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis at Wake Forest
University.
   Asked by a panelist what penalties he would propose for those
who continued to have abortions in a post-Roe-vs.-Wade scenario,
Bush advocated criminal penalties for women who terminate a
pregnancy.
   Then-campaign director James A. Baker III, now the secretary of
state, called reporters the next morning to tell them that Bush had
thought through the issue further.
   What Bush meant to say, Baker explained, was that women who have
abortions are ``additional victims'' and that any sanctions ought
to be brought against those who perform abortions.
   Bush has acknowledged that his position on the issue has been
``evolving'' over the years. He is known to have been deeply
affected, for instance, when his son Marvin and Marvin's wife,
Margaret, adopted a little girl. ``I thank God that her parents
chose life,'' Bush has said of his granddaughter.
   Three days after his inauguration, Bush told an anti-abortion
rally via a telephone hookup that abortion is ``our national
tragedy,'' and he spoke forcefully in favor of ending abortion on
demand.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked to explain how
Bush could reconcile his acceptance of three circumstances for
abortion with his support for reversing the landmark Supreme Court
decision.
   Asked what relief Bush would suggest for a woman whose case fit
one of the three categories but who lived in a state that outlawed
all abortions in a post-Roe-vs.-Wade world, Fitzwater replied,
``Well, he believes that Roe vs. Wade should be reversed and that
the states have responsibilities or rights to pass their own laws
regarding this matter.
   ``And he simply makes his views known on the issues, and the
states are free to follow that or not,'' the press secretary said.
   Nancy Broff, legislative director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said Bush's position is tantamount to letting
women fend for themselves.
   ``What would he say to the women who are on Medicaid, who are
brutalized by rape or incest, who currently can't get funding to
pay for abortions?'' she asked. ``I think what he's saying is that
if he were the one making the rules, he'd allow abortions under
three circumstances. But what he's saying is that he'd rather allow
7,416 state legislators to make this decision for women.''
   David O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life
Committee, said he's ``comfortable'' with Bush's position, even if
Bush has changed his statements over the years.
   ``Neither I as a person nor the Right to Life Committee as an
organization feels there has been any wavering in his position,''
O'Steen said. ``After all, about 98 percent of abortions are not
performed to save the life of the mother or for rape or incest.''
   O'Steen acknowledged, however, that his organization's ``ideal''
abortion premise is one that more closely matches former President
Reagan's position _ permitting the procedure only to save the life
of a mother.
   Diane Wood, a University of Chicago Law School professor, said
one of the complications of the Missouri case before the Supreme
Court is that ``overruling Roe vs. Wade could rest on a
constitutional theory that there is nothing in the Constitution
which expressly permits it,'' so therefore it should be left to the
states.
   ``One position the president might want to take is to urge the
states to enact legislation (in a post-Roe-vs.-Wade situation)
recognizing the three exceptions that he would allow,'' she said.

<HEAD>Morality, Ethics And Legislation</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When would-be reformers rose up in Congress,
their elders used to say that you can't legislate morality. So they
didn't try.
   That era is gone, that slogan no longer is fashionable, and the
government has been trying for a generation to instill ethics by
statute.
   The results are mixed. The issue is far more visible. The
rebukes and punishments for misconduct are far more frequent. And
the rules of conduct are far more stringent than in the days when
the late Sen. Everett M. Dirksen rose up in mellifluous protest
against even the suggestion that members of Congress should
disclose their sources of income.
   ``There are those, of course, who say that public ethics and
values cannot be legislated,'' President Bush said as he sent
Congress his new ethics proposals last Wednesday. ``You're never
going to legislate away impropriety or, through legislation,
guarantee that everybody lives beyond the, you know, perception of
criticism.''
   But he said there should be clear, explicit and enforceable
federal ethics laws, applying across all branches of government, to
replace a code that now is in disarray.
   One reason for that disarray is that Congress has written ethics
laws for other branches of government while exempting itself. ``The
American people do not understand why certain behavior is
considered criminal when committed by an executive branch official
or perfectly legal when committed by someone in another branch of
government,'' Bush said.
   One notable example is the revolving door that allows former
members of Congress to become instant lobbyists or contract
consultants, in contrast to executive branch officials who are
barred from doing business with their former colleagues for at
least a year after leaving government.
   Bush said the rules should be uniform.
   But then, he wasn't altogether consistent himself. His proposed
rule against a quick spin through the revolving door would seem
applicable to the defense consulting work that was one of the
issues raised against former Sen. John G. Tower, Bush's rejected
nominee for secretary of defense.
   When the president was asked how he squared his ethics proposals
with his support for Tower, he said there was no conflict. ``I see
no contradiction whatsoever,'' Bush said.
   The president did not propose legislation to ban speechmaking
fees for members of the House and Senate, an omission that drew
protests from the ethics lobby. Bush said he'd leave that and the
question of a congressional pay raise for later consultation with
leaders of House and Senate.
   But the president did say flatly that ``honoraria for member of
Congress should be banned'' and that Congress should have a pay
raise. A similar ban was proposed earlier this year, but it was
scrapped along with the 51 percent pay raise Congress didn't dare
to accept.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell said he also favors a
ban on honoraria, with a corresponding increase in congressional
pay. He added that pay increases should not be effective
immediately for the Congress that approves them, but after the next
round of elections.
   The open question is whether Congress will risk taking on the
politically unpopular question of its own pay again this year.
``There is no point, absolutely no point, in putting Congress
through another traumatic bashing like the one just completed,''
Bush said.
   Another Bush proposal underscored another inconsistency in
ethics rules. He said Congress should act this year to close the
loophole that permits some senior members to convert surplus
political contributions to personal use. That is permitted for
members elected before 1980.
   Ironically, that abuse was a central issue in one of the cases
that marked the change in congressional attitudes about legislated
ethics.
   The year was 1967, when Bobby Baker was convicted of financial
wrongdoing, Rep. Adam Clayton Powell was denied his House seat for
misappropriating office and expense funds, and Sen. Thomas J. Dodd
of Connecticut was censured by the Senate.
   The central accusation against Dodd was that he had used
political funds for personal purposes. That was held to have
brought dishonor and disrepute to the Senate.
   Now, after a generation of ethics inquiries, rulings and laws,
some similar conduct is held to be legal.
   Bush described his government ethics proposals to the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, and he offered a pointed suggestion
to a profession that is grappling with ethical questions of its own.
   ``Public service is not the sum of our perks or possessions, but
a measure of how we conduct ourselves and what we achieve,'' the
president said. ``Come to think of it, this is a good code for all
occupations, from high school to the highest callings in journalism
and government.''

   Peter V. Ueberroth's proposed $464 million
purchase of strikebound Eastern Airlines collapsed over an impasse
with its unions and parent Texas Air Corp., the former baseball
commissioner said.
   His announcement Wednesday squelched a stunning but short-lived
effort to buy one of the nation's most strife-ridden airlines,
which has been mired in an emotional strike and bankruptcy
proceedings for more than a month.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said the Miami-based airline's
strategy now was to reorganize as a smaller carrier serving roughly
50 percent to 60 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040
flights a day and employing some 15,000 to 18,000 people, compared
with 31,000 before the strike.

and union officials. No progress reported.
   _March 1 _ Eastern makes sweetened contract offer to pilots to
try to keep them flying if Machinists strike.

contract that would reduce pay but keep it 13 percent higher than
employees who took 1986 cut.
   _March 3 _ President Bush refuses mediation board request to use
authority under Railway Labor Act to delay strike 60 days.
Machinists sent home for the day after Eastern alleges planned
sabotage. Machinists reject latest contract offer. Eastern cancels

workers. Talks collapse at midnight.
   _March 4 _ Strike begins, canceling almost 90 percent of Eastern
flights, stranding passengers across nation, in Caribbean and Latin
America.
   _March 5 _ Few Eastern flights take off as pilots honor the

picketing 12 commuter railroads and Amtrak, but cancel plans after
federal judge in New York bars employees on three of the rail lines
from honoring picket lines.
   _March 6 _ Eastern idles 7,000 non-union workers and cancels all
flights except those on its Northeast shuttle and three round_trips
weekly between Miami and South America. Airline asks federal judge
to order pilots back to work.
   _March 7 _ Federal judge refuses to order Eastern pilots back to
work. Eastern warns it cannot operate for more than 48-72 hours
without pilots and could file for bankruptcy protection. Pilots
union reports overture by management seeking new talks. Eastern
furloughs 2,500 more employees. Threatened national safety slowdown
by pilots' union has only sporadic effect. House subcommittee

reiterates opposition to intervention but says he will ask Congress
to ban secondary boycotts if the Machinists try to shut down rail
service.
   _March 8 _ TWA Chairman Carl Icahn says he is willing to talk
with Machinists asking him to seek control of Eastern. Machinists

60 hours a week without overtime and take periodic time off without
pay.
   _March 20 _ Flight attendants call a strike at Continental
Airlines, Eastern's sister carrier. Real estate tycoon Donald Trump
seeks to cut at least $125 million from the $365 million he agreed
to pay last October for Eastern's Northeast shuttle.
   _March 24 _ Continental flight attendants end a four-day walkout.
   _March 30 _ A group led by Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth
says it submitted and withdrew a $464 million buyout proposal for
Eastern. Sources said Texas Air may have been leaning toward a
higher offer from billionaire Hyatt hotel executive Jay Pritzker.
   _March 31 _ Trump announces he had completed a restructured deal
to buy Eastern's Northeast shuttle for $365 million. The new deal
provides him with four additional Boeing 727s.
   _April 4 _ Ueberroth's group makes a new offer to purchase
Eastern, according to airline industry and baseball sources. Senate
Democrats withdraw from the floor legislation requiring Bush to
intervene in the strike.
   _April 6 _ Texas Air announces the Ueberroth group will acquire
Eastern and a 19.9 percent stake in the System One reservations
system in a deal valued at $464 million. Under the deal, Eastern
employees would own 30 percent of the airline company in return for
wage and benefit concessions.
   _April 10 _ After a week of negotiations, Ueberroth announces
5-year deals under which Eastern unions would accept $210 million
worth of concessions in return for a 30 percent stake in the
airline.
   _April 12 _ Ueberroth and Eastern announce his buyout proposal
collapsed due to an impasse with Texas Air over the unions' demand
a trustee be named to head the airline until the purchase is
completed. Ueberroth says he will not make another offer and
Eastern President Phil Bakes says the airline intended to
reorganize as a smaller carrier serving roughly 50 percent to 60
percent of its pre-strike schedule.

<HEAD>Retailer's Board Approves New Holding Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   F.W. Woolworth Co.'s board of directors has
approved a new corporate structure that the giant retailer said was
aimed at making itself more responsive to business opportunities.
   Under the plan, which must be approved by stockholders,
Woolworth would become a wholly owned subsidiary of a new holding
entity called Woolworth Corp.
   ``The company believes the new holding company arrangement would
more accurately reflect the company's current management
structure,'' Woolworth said Wednesday in a statement.
   ``Additionally, it would increase organizational, operational
and financial flexibility, and allow Woolworth Corp. to more
effectively take advantage of future business opportunities,'' the
company stated.
   The company did not elaborate on why the board took the action
or what future business opportunities might be contemplated.
Woolworth spokeman J.F. Carroll said the company would confine its
comments to the written announcement.
   The plan, to be presented to stockholders at an annual meeting
in Universal City, Calif., on June 22, calls for outstanding shares
of Woolworth's common and series A preferred stock to be
automatically exchanged for equal holdings of the new Woolworth
Corp., which would be based in New York.
   Retail industry analysts said they were unable to determine the
significance of Woolworth's move given that the new arrangement
apparently would not alter the company's ownership in any
meaningful way.
   Woolworth's shares closed at $51.50 in New York Stock Exchange
consolidated trading, up $1.50.
   Woolworth said that if the plan is approved, each share in
Woolworth Corp. would ``represent the same interest in the same
business and assets, operated under the same management, as did a
share of the company immediately prior to the share exchange.''
   To bolster their abilities to defend themselves against unwanted
takeover attempts, numerous companies have realigned their
corporate structures, some adopting employee stock owernship plans
(ESOPs) to place a bigger portion of their shares in friendly hands.
   Last year, Woolworth attracted the interest of the corporate
raiding Haft family.
   A partnership controlled by Dart Group Corp.'s Chairman Herbert
Haft last spring disclosed plans to acquire $15 million or more of
the retailer's stock.
   Haft and his son Robert have become known as corporate raiders
because on repeated occasions they have purchased stakes in
companies, made unsuccessful takeover bids and then profited by
selling their stock when the companies have repurchased the shares
or gone private in buyouts.
   Several analysts said they were unaware of any renewed takeover
interest in Woolworth lately nor have they heard speculation about
what Woolworth might be intending to do, if anything.
   Woolworth's, which started as an owner of five-and-dime stores
and has expanded into specialty areas such as sportswear, had
revenue of more than $8 billion in 1988 and operated more than
7,700 stores in the United States, Canada, West Germany and
Australia.

<HEAD>Texaco Optimistic Of Its Prospects A Year After Leaving Bankruptcy

<TEXT>
   Whether Texaco Inc. can keep its promises to
become a more competitive, more profitable company remains to be
seen, but the oil giant is definitely headed in the right
direction, industry analysts say.
   Since last April, the nation's third-largest oil company reduced
its debt dramatically, raised $7 billion in cash from asset sales
and set a new business course that President James W. Kinnear hopes
will make Texaco ``one of the industry's most admired, competitive
and profitable companies.''
   At a meeting with industry analysts today, Texaco, which is
rivaled in size only by Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., is expected to
present itself as a proudly reorganized, more profitable company
ready to meet the competition of the 1990s.
   ``The story is an attractive one to see,'' said Michael Young,
an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Analysts say management should take the credit for the company's
turnaround.
   ``They've done a remarkably good job when you look at the events
that have transpired,'' said Young.
   Frank P. Knuettel, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said last year's skeptics have become this year's believers
after watching Texaco exceed its initial asset sale plans.
   ``Now they're thinking, `Maybe this management does have this
situation in grasp.' And I believe it does,'' Knuettel said.
   But the company, which has shifted its primary focus from
refining oil to exploration and production, still must make a big
oil find and continue to prepare for crude price volatility.
   ``The tests of its promises are still coming up,'' said Stephen
Smith of Bear Stearns &amp; Co. ``It won't be decided in a year.''
   In April 1987, Texaco filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws to avoid having to post a
potentially ruinous multibillion-dollar security bond in its fight
with Pennzoil Co.
   Pennzoil had sued Texaco, claiming Texaco's 1984 acquisition of
Getty Oil Co. interfered with Pennzoil's prior contract to buy part
of reserve-rich Getty. In 1985, a Houston jury awarded Pennzoil a
$10.3 billion judgment. Texaco appealed the judgment but eventually
settled with Pennzoil for $3 billion amid heavy shareholder
pressure to do so.
   Carl C. Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, began pressuring
the company into boosting its stock value largely through the sale
of assets after Texaco's board rejected his proposal to buy Texaco
for $60 a share. Last year, Icahn narrowly lost a proxy fight for
control of Texaco's board.
   Even before the bankruptcy, Texaco had begun a major
restructuring. But Icahn's overtures led to Texaco selling $7
billion in assets, including its lucrative Canadian subsidiary,
Texas Canada Inc., rather than the $5 billion originally planned.
   Texaco also agreed to pay two special dividends consisting of
cash and preferred stock with a total value of $8 per share, or
approximately $1.95 billion. In addition, the company plans to buy
back $500 million in common stock before August 1990.
   Icahn, who owns 17 percent of Texaco, agreed in return not to
buy any more Texaco stock for seven years.
   Many analysts say Texaco's stock price, which has hovered in the
$53 range, reflects its full value, but that could change if Icahn
decides to sell his share.
   Last year, Texaco turned a profit of $1.3 billion, or $5.35 a
share, compared with a 1987 loss of $4.14 billion, but that could
dramatically improve in 1989.
   Texaco still plans to sell about $300 million more in what it
considers marginal properties.
   Last week, it further reduced refining interests by announcing a
joint venture with Sweden's OK Petroleum AB that included the sale
of its 43 percent interest in a Swedish refinery along with its
depots and marketing interests.

<HEAD>With PM-Eastern, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlanta attorney Moreton Rolleston Jr., a
frequent passenger on embattled Eastern Airlines, filed a petition
with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court that was used as the basis for the
judge's order in the case Wednesday.
   Referring to Rolleston's petition, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
R. Lifland ordered the parties involved in Eastern's Chapter 11
reorganization to show why he should not throw the airline open to
all biddersw _ and include ith it certain assets parent Texas Air
Corp. has bought or transferred from Eastern since acquiring it in
1986.
   Among other things, Rolleston's petition seeks to block the sale
of Eastern's Northeast shuttle for $365 million to developer Donald
Trump.
   Rolleston, 71, who handles litigation in cases involving real
estate and other areas, is a member of Eastern's frequent flier
program who says he has flown 600,000 miles on the airline since
1955.
   ``Nobody so far has taken any interest in what the public needs
except the judge (Lifland),'' Rolleston said late Wednesday in a
telephone interview from his home. ``I think something ought to be
done as soon as possible to get that airline flying.''
   Lifland has said on several occasions that it is in the public's
interest to return Eastern to a full schedule of flights quickly.

   A Manhattan diamond dealer says he has formed a
partnership with an unidentified foreign airline that he said could
raise more than $250 million by the end of the week for a bid for
Eastern Airlines.
   Willy Censor, 62, said Wednesday he had met with officials from
Eastern and U.S. Bankruptcy Court to discuss his proposal for
buying the strikebound carrier. Eastern attorney David Boies
confirmed he met with Censor but declined to say whether the
airline was taking the bid seriously.
   A $464 million proposal from a group headed by former baseball
commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth collapsed Wednesday over a reported
union demand that an interim trustee run the airline during
bankruptcy proceedings.
   Censor owns O. Censor and Co., founded by his father in Antwerp,
Belgium, in 1917 and now located in Manhattan's diamond district.
He said he has owned stock in airlines.
   ``I am interested in airlines, in any business that can make
money,'' Censor said in an interview in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   He declined to name the overseas airline with which he said he
had formed a a partnership, but said, ``They have all the expertise
I need.''
   ``He told me he's been dreaming about owning an airline since he
came to America in 1946,'' said Judah Dick, Censor's attorney.
   ``All I can tell you is he has some connection with some
overseas airline that has apparently taken an interest in buying
out Eastern,'' Dick said. ``He's going to finance it because the
airline doesn't have the wherewithal to finance it.''
   Censor said he met with U.S. Trustee Harold Jones on Friday to
discuss the bid. He said Jones told him to submit a proposal to
David Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner overseeing part of
Eastern's bankruptcy proceedings. Jones and Shapiro were
unavailable for comment.
   Censor said he sent a telegram on Friday to Shapiro outlining
his interest in the deal and unsuccessfully tried to contact
Ueberroth and Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air.
Corp.
   ``My group is now in a position to obtain within one week from
today commitments from appropriate banks and from my own resources
of in excess of $250 million for the purchase of control of Eastern
Airlines,'' the cable read.
   ``Moreover, I can provide such further financing thereafter as
would be required to assure the airline's viability without
recourse to the Eastern shuttle.
   ``I am confident that retaining the Eastern shuttle will assure
more success with the Machinists than Mr. Ueberroth will have
because as they well know, the shuttle is at the heart of any
profitability which Eastern may have and is the key to its future
viability.''
   Eastern sought federal bankruptcy court protection from
creditors on March 9, five days after its Machinists union went on
strike and was joined by its pilots and flight attendants,
virtually shutting the carrier down.
   Eastern has agreed to sell its prized Northeast shuttle to
developer Donald Trump for $365 million, a deal pending approval in
bankruptcy court.

<HEAD>IMF Deal Done, Mexico Faces Tough Bank Talks on Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico will be ``firm but very cautious'' in
debt talks next week with its commercial bank creditors now that it
has in hand a $3.65 billion loan from the International Monetary
Fund, top Mexican officials said Wednesday.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's Third World debt
reduction plan speeded negotiation of the loan, the officials told
reporters at a background briefing.
   ``We got what we wanted,'' said one of the officials, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Mexico also will ask banks to reschedule about $2 billion in
amortization of principal that come due this year, they said.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari wants to reduce the burden
of Mexico's $107 billion foreign debt and keep more money inside
the country for economic investment. Mexico is the developing
world's second-largest debtor behind Brazil, which owes $121
billion.
   Mexicans have seen their standard of living decline by half over
the last seven years, and Salinas is under political and social
pressure to reverse that course and renew growth.
   The three-year agreement reached Tuesday with the IMF is the
first since Brady outlined a plan last month that he hoped would
help ease payment terms on the Third World's $1.32 trillion foreign
debt.
   Getting creditor governments, banks, the IMF and the World Bank
to coordinate will take time, one Mexican official warned. But
Brady brought together proposals by leaders of industrialized and
developing nations and pushed the plan.
   ``In this sense the Brady Plan has speeded up the process,'' he
said, adding it took just 11 days of direct talks to hammer out the
IMF loan.
   The $3.65 billion loan will be used to bolster Mexico's foreign
exchange reserves and spur economic development. About one-third of
loan proceeds will be used to support Mexico's debt-reduction
proposals to the banks, the official said.
   Together with other short-term credits Mexico is seeking from
the IMF, the World Bank and other sources, Mexico will devote about
$500 million annually to debt reduction, he said.
   Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe said Tuesday that Mexico will
offer banks the option of exchanging old debt for Mexican bonds
that discount debt principal and reduce interest rates.
   Mexico may choose to use loan proceeds to buy U.S. Treasury
bonds as collateral that the Mexican bonds will be paid, one
official said Wednesday.
   The banks need an inducement to buy the bonds, ``and this costs
money. We have to go into debt to get out of debt,'' he said.
   Issuing bonds to banks that retire part of their Mexican debt is
an attractive option to Mexico, with each dollar's worth of bond
capable of saving Mexico up to $12 in loan service costs over a
30-year period, the official said.
   Other options for bank creditors are being explored to meet
Mexico's goal of reducing its net outflow of resources to pay debt
from 6 percent to 2 percent of annual gross national product, the
officials said.
   ``We don't yet know'' how the restructuring talks will work out,
one said. ``We'll put before the banks option A, option B and
option C and use what they take.''
   Mexico also will ask banks whose Mexico amortizations come due
this year to reschedule payment, the officials said. They estimated
the amount at $2 billion, but did not say how much time they were
seeking.
   They added that implementing the Brady plan with such ideas as
creating a multinational pool of funds to support debt writeoffs
``still lack details,'' but that creditor banks are well aware of
Mexico's urgency in reaching a restructuring agreement.
   ``We have to be firm but very cautious,'' one official said.
``The urgency is obvious, but we must not allow ourselves to fall
into it. The banks are aware of this urgency.''
   Negotiations with a 13-member bank committee are set to begin
April 19 in New York.

   Wesray Capital Corp., a New York investment
company founded by former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon,
has approached a Northwest Airlines' union about a takeover bid for
the airline, according to a published report.
   Northwest union leader Bruce Retrum was quoted in Thursday's St.
Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch saying that Saunders Miller, a
Minneapolis financial consultant, contacted him within the last
week to try to set up a meeting with him, leaders of other
Northwest unions and a Wesray representative to discuss a leveraged
buyout.
   ``There were no specifics, but my assumption was that he wanted
to talk about an ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) or some
employee stock ownership,'' said Retrum, secretary-treasurer of
Teamsters Local 2747, which represents some of the airline's 6,500
flight attendants.
   The meeting was scheduled for Thursday but then postponed by
Miller, Retrum said.
   Miller declined comment, telling the newspaper, ``There is
nothing going on today that I'm aware of.''
   Wesray has participated in a number of buyouts, including the
employee purchase of Avis, but last week a spokesman for Simon said
he wasn't interested in buying Northwest.
   Meanwhile, the failure of Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis
to release details Wednesday of a plan to finance his proposed
$2.62 billion takeover of Northwest was viewed as a hopeful sign by
Gov. Rudy Perpich, who is fighting to keep the airline independent.
   Perpich said Davis had been expected to release details of his
plan Wednesday.
   NWA Inc. stock closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange
at $90.50, up $1.50, surpassing Davis' offer of $90 a share.
   Davis, an oil mogul with interests in real estate and
entertainment, says he plans a shareholder proxy fight to win
control of the airline's board at NWA's May 15 shareholders meeting.
   Last Friday, NWA's board of directors rejected Davis' offer,
calling it inadequate. The board also reaffirmed its intention to
maintain the nation's fourth-largest airline as an independent
entity.
   Northwest, based in suburban Eagan, has asked a federal judge to
prevent Davis from negotiating with its unions, while Davis has
filed a separate lawsuit seeking to invalidate Northwest's ``poison
pill'' anti-takeover plan.
   Shortly before Davis announced his bid March 30, the airline
disclosed that another investor, whom it would not identify, holds
a 4.9 percent stake in NWA stock.

<HEAD>Hewlett-Packard To Buy Apollo In Move To Seize Workstation Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. surpassed its
rivals in the thriving computer workstation market when it
announced a surprise agreement to buy Apollo Computer Inc.,
analysts say.
   Hewlett-Packard's $476 million cash purchase offer for Apollo, a
pioneer in the engineering workstation market, also stole some
limelight from principal rival Sun Microsystems Inc., which picked
Wednesday to unveil an entire overhaul of its high-powered
workstations line.
   ``We're pretty sure they won't be too delighted to hear this,''
said Richard Watts, director of marketing in Hewlett-Packard's
computer products sector, speculating on Sun's reaction to the
acquisition.
   The announcement Wednesday moved Hewlett-Packard into the
leadership position in the $4 billion computer workstation market.
Apollo and Hewlett-Packard together would have 30.4 percent of the
workstation market, taking the lead from Sun, which has 28.3
percent, according to Dataquest Inc., a San Jose-based research
firm.
   The workstation market is expected to grow at a 30 percent clip
through 1993, according to Alea Fairchild, an analyst with
Dataquest.
   Workstations are single-user computers that resemble personal
computers but are usually quicker, more powerful and with larger
screens and better graphics. They were originally used mostly by
scientists and engineers but are being increasingly targeted for
everyday personal and business use.
   ``It signals a real major commitment on our part to the
workstation portion of our business,'' said Watts.
   Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, said it will offer $13.12
per share for Apollo's estimated 36 million shares of common stock
outstanding and will begin its tender offer within five business
days.
   Apollo shares shot up $4.62{ to close at $12.75 in heavy
over-the-counter trading of 10 million shares. Hewlett-Packard fell
75 cents a share to $53.50 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   The deal requires regulatory approval and the tender of at least
51 percent of Apollo stock by shareholders. The deal should take 90
days to complete, said Watts.
   Apollo, a Fortune 500 company founded in 1980 and based in
Chelmsford, Mass., has suffered recent setbacks in the race with
Sun and lost money in two consecutive quarters last year. It
squeezed out a profit of $2.1 million for the year as a whole on
sales of $654 million.
   But Apollo Chairman and CEO Thomas A. Vanderslice said Wednesday
that the company's earnings due out next week would show ``very
strong'' results.
   Apollo will likely operate as a division within
Hewlett-Packard's workstation group once the acquisition is
completed, which should be in 90 days, said Watts.
   Vanderslice termed the transaction a ``win-win'' situation for
both companies and said he did not foresee major layoffs resulting
from the purchase.
   Hewlett-Packard said it will benefit from Apollo's strength in
computer networking and its large customer base and motivated work
force.
   Hewlett-Packard will bring its strength in the graphics area to
Apollo, which could use the help, as well as financial resources
that include $9.8 billion in revenues last year.
   ``The Hewlett-Apollo thing was pretty astonishing,'' said
Michael Murphy, a senior analyst and editor of San Francisco-based
California Technology Stock Letter. ``What Hewlett I think is doing
here is building a lot of customer relationships that they are then
going to migrate over into the Unix world.''
   Workstations run on Unix, an operating system that excels in
communications and the ability to carry out multiple tasks
simultaneously.
   The announcement came as Sun Microsystems rolled out a line of
computers that boast sophisticated new graphics and digital sound,
plus higher speeds and a circuit board that allows full-motion
video on a computer screen, useful for teleconferencing. It also
launched a family of Sun-3 workstations.
   ``I think that maybe is purely coincidental but it is
interesting timing,'' said Barry F. Bosak, an analyst with New
York-based Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Hewlett-Packard had 16.9 percent of the 1987-88 market share for
workstations and Apollo had 13.5 percent, Dataquest said.

   Millions of cars and trucks are recalled
annually. When they roll into dealerships, dollars follow.
   ``It's profitable for the dealership to do the recalls,'' said
Bill Schmirl, service manager at Doan Ford in Rochester, N.Y.
``There's markup on parts and labor.''
   Service managers' eyes lit up earlier this week when Ford Motor
Co. asked car and truck owners to return more than 340,000 vehicles
to fix a variety of safety-related and other problems.
   The recalls involved suspension problems in trucks, a seat belt
bolt in new luxury cars, potential electric troubles in some 1988
model cars and trucks, and cracked and discolored leather
upholstery in a car Ford imports from West Germany.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said about
4.2 million vehicles were recalled in 1988 for safety-related
problems. The Environmental Protection Agency said 3.3 million were
recalled for emission system problems. In addition, automakers
independently issued recalls for other reasons.
   For dealers' service departments, each vehicle brought back for
the free repairs means profits on parts and labor costs borne by
the manufacturer.
   ``It is a good time to sell service,'' said Bill Heitritter,
service manager at Crescent Chevrolet-Geo in Des Moines, Iowa. ``It
helps the dealer because it's a selling thing.
   ``We process about 2,000 to 3,000 recalls a year,'' he said.
``It's a priority thing for us.''
   Automakers declined to say how much they spend on recalls
annually. Regardless of the expense, Ford spokesman Chuck Snearly
said paying for recall repairs is just good business.
   ``It's considerably less than the cost of a lawsuit and the
disloyalty of an owner down the road,'' he said. ``People don't
mind having a problem when it's fixed for free. What will get you
into trouble is if you have a problem and you don't respond to
people.''
   General Motors Corp. spokesman Dave Hudgens added that
``research shows that customers want to hear from the manufacturer
when there is a safety concern.''
   Automakers learn of possible problems from various sources,
including assembly line workers, drivers at proving grounds,
consumer groups and government agencies.
   After investigating, a manufacturer will decide whether to issue
a recall on its own. The federal highway safety organization and
the EPA can order recalls, but most are made by automakers,
sometimes with government prodding.
   Notifying owners is a tough job in a country that lives on
wheels. Automakers often consult R.L. Polk &amp; Co. in Detroit, which
monitors U.S. vehicle registrations, to find who owns a vehicle
being recalled.
   ``We continue to follow up and send letters, wave after wave of
letters, until we get a completion rate as high as we could get,''
Ford's Snearly said.
   That ranges from nearly 100 percent for a new car to 75 percent
for a 5-year-old vehicle. Older cars or those that have changed
hands are harder to find.
   Problems appearing more serious to consumers _ such as possible
steering failure _ typically get a higher initial response rate
than problems that seem less critical, such as an emissions system
leak.
   Depending on the trouble, customers may wait to have recall work
performed until their vehicle is due for routine maintenance or
until something else goes wrong. Sometimes recalls are simply
ignored.
   The automakers maintain they are clear of liability for defects
once a good faith attempt is made to find the owner of a recalled
car.
   Some dealers routinely check for pending recalls when cars
arrive to be serviced.
   Ford said that occurred recently during the ``American Pony
Drive,'' a caravan of Ford Mustangs brought to the United States by
their European owners in connection with the model's 25th
anniversary.
   The driver of a 1969 Mustang Shelby GT went to a dealer to have
some work done. The dealer found that Ford had recalled the car 20
years ago to move part of the fuel system away from the exhaust
system, Snearly said.
   ``(The driver) had the car in Europe and hadn't been aware of
the recall,'' he said. The problem was promptly fixed.

   USX Corp., which more than tripled its
earnings in 1988 largely because of the strong performance of its
steel division, will distribute $71 million in profit-sharing to
20,500 steelworkers this week.
   The average payment will be $3,500 and must be mailed by April
15 under the company's contract with the United Steelworkers of
America. Payments equal 10.6 percent of employees' 1988 earnings,
or $1.70 for every hour worked.
   ``Not bad,'' said Charles J. Grese, president of USW Local 1557
at USX's Clairton Works, who noted that the payment still is less
than 1988 concessions valued at $2.12 per hour by the union.
   Steel contributed an operating profit of $501 million to the
corporation in 1988, helping Pittsburgh-based USX earn a total of
$756 million, or $2.62 a share, on revenues of $16.9 billion.
   This year's payment is the second for the company's USW workers.
Last year, they received $28 million, or 90 cents an hour, for
1987. That equaled about $1,700 for each worker.
   About 18,000 LTV Steel Co. workers will share $100 million in
profit-sharing checks also are due to be mailed this week, company
spokesman Mark Tomasch said.
   LTV workers will receive about $1.80 for every hour worked in
1988, or $3,744 based on a normal work year of 2,080 hours
excluding overtime, plus stock valued at 70 cents an hour.
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. distributed profit-sharing payments on
March 31 averaging $3,500 for each of 24,000 salaried and hourly
employees represented by the steelworkers and other unions.
   National Steel Corp., based in Pittsburgh, issued profit-sharing
checks last month averaging $1,835.

<HEAD>FCC To Consider Granting More Options to AT&amp;T</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission says it
will consider whether there is enough competition in the
long-distance market to give the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
more latitude in pricing.
   A decision to unleash AT&amp;T, if it came, would be a major change
in federal regulation of the telephone industry. AT&amp;T has always
been considered a ``dominant'' carrier that could crush its
competition if not restrained, and it has been tightly regulated.
   But AT&amp;T has said that since 1984, when it agreed under federal
order to shed local telephone companies, it no longer is the
dominant force in the long-distance business.
   Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis asked Wednesday for a broad
look at long-distance competition after the commission ordered AT&amp;T
to revise or stop offering its so-called Tariff 12 custom service
plan for some major customers.
   Dennis said she agreed with the FCC's order on Tariff 12, which
gives AT&amp;T 30 days to revise its plan, but that the commission had
not addressed the larger issue of whether the long-distance
marketplace was competitive today.
   ``It is the seminal issue in so many of the other issues we've
looked at,'' she said in an interview.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick agreed and asked his staff to find a
way to ``determine exactly what kind of competition AT&amp;T faces and
then regulate accordingly,'' Dennis said.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said that by agreeing to look at
long-distance competition ``this commission recognizes that the
world is changing and it needs to take a hard look at the realities
that face all those in the long-distance business ... rather than
shaping public policies on realities that were prevalent before
1984.''
   In its Tariff 12 order, the commission said it found the plan
was not widely available to other customers, and therefore illegal.
   But AT&amp;T will not have to stop serving its existing Tariff 12
customers, which include the General Electric Co., Du Pont Co. and
Ford Motor Co. Instead, those customers can take service under the
tariff until the deadline for revising or withdrawing the tariff.
   The commission gave AT&amp;T 30 days to implement changes or drop
the tariff.
   Tariff 12 integrates voice and data services into packages to
meet specific customer needs. Critics of Tariff 12 argue that AT&amp;T
is simply bundling basic phone services that are strictly regulated
by the FCC, adding in a network management provision and then
offering the package to large customers at reduced rates.
   The effect would be to possibly undercut competitor's prices.
   But the commission found that AT&amp;T's basic phone services were
not ``like'' the integrated services offered under Tariff 12.
Therefore, AT&amp;T, the commission said, was not offering price breaks
to GE or DuPont, for example, for the same services it provides
non-Tariff 12 customers.
   The commission also found that the Tariff 12 packages were
``like'' each other, so AT&amp;T was not favoring one Tariff 12
customer over another.
   But it said some Tariff 12 provisions were unlawful because they
``contained unreasonable geographic restrictions which deny service
to similarly situated customers seeking `like' packages.''
   One of AT&amp;T's main competitors, MCI Communications Corp., said
it found it ``inconceivable that the commission, having found
Tariff 12 to be unlawful, is allowing these rates to remain in
effect while AT&amp;T develops new, and probably similarly unlawful
rates to replace them.''
   When AT&amp;T resubmits the Tariff 12 plan for approval, the FCC
said the company must state that the plan will be generally
available and that it eliminates any ``unreasonably specific
limitations on availability.''
   AT&amp;T said it was pleased with the order.
   ``Today's FCC action is another step forward for AT&amp;T and
particularly for customers who unanimously support allowing AT&amp;T to
be able to compete to meet their needs. ... We believe we will be
able to conform to the FCC's guidelines.''

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in active European trading late
this morning. Gold prices were little changed.
   Currency dealers attributed the drop to rumors of the
appointment of a new West German finance minister who reportedly
wants to reduce or even eliminate a controversial 10 percent
withholding tax on interest income.
   They said that while the dollar is losing ground against most
major currencies, active buying of Deutsche marks is moving the
market.
   The dealers were referring to media speculation that West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl will name Theo Waigel, head of the
conservative Christian Social Union, to replace Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg.
   They said Waigel has made the repeal or modification of the
withholding tax on interest income a condition for taking the post.
The tax, instituted Jan. 1, has led to a large outflow of capital
from West Germany since and has weakened the mark's exchange rate.
   ``Most people I talked to think (the rumors of the tax repeal)
are nonsense, but you can't exclude anything,'' said one dealer at
a large West German bank in Frankfurt. ``There is nothing going on,
so people jump on small things like that.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar slipped 0.05 yen to a closing 132.80. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 132.55 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.8702 West German marks, down from 1.88575;
1.6565 Swiss francs, down from 1.6645; 6.3330 French francs, down
from 6.3690; 2.1110 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1270; 1,374.80
Italian lire, down from 1,381.00; and 1.1880 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.18875.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6994, slightly more
expensive for buyers than late Wednesday's $1.6925.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $387.75 a troy ounce, up
from $387.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $387.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $387.65, up from $387.30 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.09 to close at a bid $388.46.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.88 a troy
ounce, little changed from Wednesday's $5.89.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Up Against Yen, Share Prices Rise A Bit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged up today against the Japanese
yen for the third consecutive day, while share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange gained marginally.
   The dollar closed at 132.85 yen, up 0.23 yen from Tuesday's
132.62-yen closing. It opened at 132.68 yen and ranged from 132.60
yen to 132.88 yen. The dollar now has gained 0.77 yen in three
trading days.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
a 250.56-point gainer the previous day, inched up another 6.87
points, or 0.02 percent, closing at 33,256.45.
   Selling to take profits in the afternoon erased most of the
Nikkei's gain in morning trading, dealers said.
   ``The index started to weaken at midmorning, mainly because
there was no market-affecting news to encourage buying today,''
said Satoru Nagayoshi of New Japan Securities Co.
   He said investors were hesitant to buy certain shares until
after they have seen major U.S. economic indicators, including the
nation's trade figures for February, due to be announced Friday in
Washington.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1 billion
shares, down from Tuesday's 1.1 billion. Among the gainers were
machinery and construction issues.
   In currency dealings, participants also generally remained on
the sidelines awaiting Friday's U.S. trade and wholesale price
index figures, said Ichiro Ikeda of Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   The U.S. currency edged up shortly before the end of trading due
to position adjustments, he added.
   ``Also, yen-selling to buy West German marks contributed to the
dollar's rise against the yen,'' Ikeda said.
   ``But investors' dollar-buying incentives won't be strong enough
to push the currency beyond the 133-yen level before the weekend at
least,'' he said.

   Eastern Airlines' skeleton management staff can now
put aside, at least temporarily, worries about a change in
ownership and focus on rebuilding the faltering airline, says a
company spokesman.
   Officials announced Wednesday that a proposed $464 million offer
to buy the carrier from a group led by Peter V. Ueberroth had
fallen through.
   ``It's really been a roller coaster,'' spokesman Robin Matell
said Wednesday. ``It's really been impossible to concentrate on a
plan as such.''
   Eastern President Phil Bakes, in announcing the end of the
buyout effort by former baseball commissioner Ueberroth, said the
company envisions a gradual rebuilding to an efficient carrier with
about 18,000 employees and 130 to 150 jetliners flying to 60 to 80
cities.
   ``We are going to continue to bring in new recruits and continue
to build our system,'' Bakes said in New York. ``We are hopeful we
will be afforded the opportunity to accelerate and work on that
task.''
   Matell said it was premature to discuss how Eastern, flying only
10 percent of its schedule since its unions walked out March 4,
will get back to 50 to 60 percent of its old schedule of 1,040
flights daily.
   Eastern employed 40,000 people when Texas Air Corp. Chairman
Frank Lorenzo bought the company in 1986, a number that dwindled to
30,000 before the strike.
   Union leaders, however, doubt that Eastern's management can
overcome negative publicity, some $2.5 billion in debt, a recent
history of steady losses and the need to find qualified workers to
replace strikers.
   ``The airlines is in a spin. It's almost hit the ground and
they're still telling people they can pull it out,'' said Eastern
pilot Ed Potter, who scoffed at Bakes' promise to rebuild the
airline.
   Spokesman James Ashlock said Eastern has been quietly calling
non-union workers back, to a work force now at 4,500 from a low of
1,000 the first week of the strike. The company had 12,000
non-union employees when the strike began, and officials said they
don't know how many will be willing to return.
   Ashlock said employees who have stayed on the job had had a lot
of concerns about the Ueberroth deal, which would have given the
unions 30 percent ownership in exchange for pay and wage
concessions.
   ``It looks like we move on to another phase,'' said Ashlock. ``I
do think there is a certain release of anxiety here at the base,
where a great many people, particularly the non-contract people,
were increasingly concerned at the way the situation had been
building.''
   Eastern now has 115 or 116 flights daily after resuming service
on Bahamas and Atlanta routes this week, Ashlock said. The company
has concentrated on its most profitable routes, mainly its
Northeastern shuttle service and Latin American service, in its
strike schedule.
   Since the strike began, Eastern competitors, particularly
American Airlines, have expanded service to capitalize on Eastern's
woes, and the company acknowledges it must overcome consumer
skepticism. Discounted tickets and other lures are likely, the
company has said.
   But Eastern needs more pilots. Only 200 of 3,600 pilots have
flown since their union joined the Machinists strike.
   The company still hopes to gain a federal appellate court order
sending the pilots back to work, even though U.S. District Judge
Edward B. Davis on Wednesday reported to a appeals court that there
was no evidence to support company claims the pilots are on an
illegal strike.
   Ashlock said 34 newly recruited pilots are in the third week of
a six-week training course, 34 more are in the second week, and a
third class will begin next week.
   So far, Eastern hasn't needed to hire any new mechanics to
replace striking Machinists, Ashlock said.

   Stock prices fell in London Thursday, and dealers
said the market suffered from a lack of buying interest.
   Most market participants apparently chose to overlook late
morning British economic indicators.
   The market was described as featureless, and participants said
they were waiting for Friday's flood of American economic
indicators and more British indicators, as well as the close of the
current two-week trading account on the London Stock Exchange.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index

<HEAD>Trade Surplus Dips in March for First Time in 7 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus fell in March to $6.74
billion, its first decline in seven months from year-earlier
levels, the Finance Ministry announced Thursday.
   Japanese exports had exceeded imports by $7.46 billion in March
1988, and by $7.24 billion in February 1989.
   The March figure brought Japan's trade surplus for fiscal 1988,
which ended March 31, to $79.01 billion, up from $75.99 billion the
previous year and the first increase in two years.
   Exports in fiscal 1988 increased 14.7 percent to $272.94
billion, while imports rose 19.7 percent to $193.92 billion, the
ministry said.
   Ministry officials said strong overseas demand for Japanese
products throughout the fiscal year had boosted exports, especially
of semiconductors, computers, cars and business machines.
   They said imports remained brisk because of strong Japanese
domestic demand, and included increased flows of foreign
manufactured goods.
   The ministry officials said the fiscal 1988 surplus rose mainly
because of lower prices for oil, Japan's largest import commodity.
   In March, exports climbed 16.9 percent from a year earlier to
$26.55 billion, while imports surged 29.8 percent to $19.81
billion, the ministry said.
   After seasonal adjustments, the March surplus came to $5.57
billion, a sharp drop from $8.86 billion in February, the ministry
said.
   The officials said imports surged in March as companies began
importing in earnest after several months of restrained consumption
due to Emperor Hirohito's death on Jan. 7 and funeral on Feb. 24.
Importers also stepped up transactions before the end of the
Japanese fiscal year, they said.
   The trade surplus with the United States in March ballooned to
$4.13 billion from $3.40 billion a year earlier, the ministry said.
Exports grew 21.6 percent to $8.75 billion, while imports rose 22
percent to $4.62 billion.
   For the fiscal year, the trade surplus with the United States
declined slightly to $49.10 billion from $50.84 billion in fiscal
1987. Exports to the United States rose 8.4 percent to $92.60
billion, while imports grew 25.7 percent to $43.50 billion, the
ministry said.
   Japan's trade surplus with the European Economic Community in
March fell to $1.67 billion from $1.93 billion a year earlier, it
said.
   For the fiscal year, Japanese exports to the EEC exceeded
imports by $22.32 billion, up from $20.11 billion the previous
year. Exports rose 20.3 percent to $47.80 billion, while imports
expanded by 29.9 percent to $25.48 billion.
   The surplus in trade with Southeast Asia in March grew to $2.34
billion from $2.03 billion in March 1988.
   Japan's trade surplus with the region for the fiscal year rose
to $20.37 billion from $14.82 billion the previous year. Exports
rose 23.9 percent to $69.86 billion, while imports grew 19.1
percent to $49.50 billion.
   Japan includes freight and insurance costs in its import
figures, but not in its exports.

<HEAD>West German Chancellor Reshuffles Government, Fires Defense Minister</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to ADD background on election losses, more quotes
from Kohl. CORRECTS number in Cabinet to 19 sted 17. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl today fired his
defense minister and replaced seven other Cabinet members in an
apparent bid to stop his party's declining popularity.
   In addition to the defense post, Kohl announced a new chief of
staff and new ministers for finance, interior, transport, economic
cooperation, construction and information.
   He told a news conference the changes were not a direct
consequence of his Christian Democratic Union's recent election
setbacks, but he conceded his party and coalition government face
``a totally new situation.''
   The Christian Democratic Union under Kohl has suffered severe
losses in recent local elections. Last month, the party and its
junior coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, lost control
of the Frankfurt city government.
   ``I had planned this Cabinet rebuilding long before that,'' Kohl
said when asked about the Frankfurt election's influence on his new
appointments.
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz was the only Cabinet member left
jobless under the changes. He was replaced by Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg.
   Scholz had no military experience prior to his appointment in
May and often was left to publicly defend the government's most
controversial defense policies. He absorbed the brunt of public
criticism for last year's deadly string of NATO and West German
military jet crashes.
   Political observers considered most of the other changes
cosmetic.
   The most significant was the naming of Theo Waigel, head of the
Christian Democratic's Bavarian sister party _ the Christian
Socialist Union _ to replace Stoltenberg as finance minister.
   The change brings Waigel into the top government sphere, a
political gift to the Christian Socialists. Some observers
suggested the appointment was demanded of Kohl to ensure the
party's allegiance to the Christian Democrats.
   Finance officials said Waigel won the position on a promise to
repeal or reform a 10 percent withholding tax that took effect this
year and drove some investments out of the country.
   Stoltenberg had been finance minister since 1982, when the
Christian Democratic Union joined forces with the liberal Free
Democratic Party to take over the Bonn government from the
left-leaning Social Democrats.
   Kohl praised the work of Scholz, who he said was ``confronted
with many problems for which he cannot be made responsible.''
   He dismissed questions on whether the Defense Ministry change
would alter the federal government's attitude toward some
controversial defense policies, including whether Bonn will support
a NATO plan to replace some short-range missiles deployed in West
Germany.
   West German defense policy is increasingly the target of public
criticism and discontent because of the number of NATO maneuvers
and low-level flying missions allowed to take place over densely
populated areas.
   ``We are in intensive discussions with our coalition partners
and the alliance,'' the chancellor said. He refused to elaborate.
   The government appointments take effect April 21, Kohl said.
   Other top-level changes included the naming of Kohl's chief of
staff, Wolfgang Schaeuble, as interior minister to replace
Friedrich Zimmermann, who will take over the Transport Ministry.
   Kohl's new chief of staff will be Rudolf Seiters, current head
of the party's parliamentary delegation.
   Transport Minister Juergen Warnke replaces Hans Klein as
minister for economic cooperation. Klein will be the new government
spokesman, which has been elevated to ministerial level.
   The current head of the government Press and Information Office
and Kohl's chief spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, resigned and is reported
to be considering offers in the private sector.
   Construction Minister Oscar Schneider was assigned to oversee
the government's controversial national museum projects in Bonn and
Berlin. He will be replaced by parliamentarian Gerda Hasselfeldt,
who brings the number of women in Kohl's 19-member Cabinet to three.

   The stock market gave ground today as traders
warily awaited the latest reading on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.88 to 2,311.77
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 325 up, 584 down and
563 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.24 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The government is due to report Friday on the producer price
index of finished goods for March, along with several other
economic statistics.
   Analysts expect the price index to show an increase of about 0.5
percent, down from 1.0 percent in both January and February.
   That would provide at least a tentative bit of evidence that a
slowing economy was reducing upward pressure on inflation and
interest rates.
   In a new bit of evidence that business activity is indeed
slackening, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales
increased a scant 0.1 percent last month, following a
downwnward-revised 0.6 percent decline in February.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down | at 110{; Philip Morris, down \ at 119|; DuPont,
down { at 104[, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down [ at 31[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.39 to 167.43. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index slipped .15 to 334.08.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.07 to
2,319.65.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners nearly 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 804 issues up, 615 down and 539 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 165.20 million shares, against 146.83
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Ireland's GPA Group Plans Largest Single Aircraft Order In History</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHANNON, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GPA Group Ltd. says it plans to buy U.S.
and European airplanes and engines worth up to $20 billion in what
would be the largest single aircraft order in history.
   GPA, one of the world's largest and fastest growing aircraft
leasing companies, said Wednesday it would announce details of the
deal in simultaneous announcements Tuesday in New York, London and
Paris.
   The company's chief operating officer, James M. King, said he is
ordering a mix of airplane models manufactured by Boeing Co. and
McDonnell Douglas Corp. of the United States and the European
consortium Airbus Industrie.
   ``The manufacturers tell us this would make it the biggest
aircraft order in aviation history,'' King said.
   King said the aircraft that GPA will buy include wide-bodied and
narrow-bodied planes and engines.
   The order includes engines supplied by Pratt and Whitney of the
United States; Britain's General Electric Co., which has no links
with General Electric of the United States; and Rolls-Royce PLC of
Britain. It also includes engines supplied by the International
Aero Engines Consortium, which includes Japanese companies, and the
Franco-U.S. CFM International group of engine-makers.
   Analysts said the order is expected to exceed 200 planes and
would be worth almost $20 billion.
   Asked about these figures, King said, ``While I cannot confirm a
precise number to you, the suggestion is substantially correct.
It's in the region of 200 aircraft.''
   King indicated that a figure somewhere between $11 billion and
$20 billion would be nearer the total value of the GPA order.
   The largest previous such order was by Delta Airlines of the
United States last September. Delta placed an order worth $10.5
billion with options for a total of 225 Boeing and
McDonnell-Douglas aircraft.
   The Engineer magazine reported that Rolls-Royce will supply
engines for 50 Boeing 757s likely to feature in the GPA order.
   British Aerospace will make the wings for the Airbus A330s and
A320s which may also be fitted with Rolls-Royce engines, the
magazine said. GPA has already ordered 40 A320s.
   McDonnell Douglas could also win orders for MD-11 and MD-80
aircraft and the former may also carry Rolls-Royce engines, the
magazine said.
   Tony Ryan, the head of GPA, said the deal would leave the
company three times larger than its nearest competitors in the
aircraft leasing field.
   GPA _ formerly called Guinness Peat Aviation _ currently owns or
leases 172 aircraft with a net value of about three billion dollars
operating with 64 carriers in 32 countries.
   GPA, founded by Ryan in the mid-1970s, is privately owned.
   A recent report by London-based investment bankers Salomon
Brothers International Ltd. valued GPA at more more than $1
billion. The company's net profits for 1988-89 are expected to
total $150 million against $101 million for 1987-88.
   GPA has indicated it was considering going public. Ryan holds 10
percent of GPA's shares. Other big shareholders include Air Canada,
the Irish airline Aer Lingus, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking of
Japan, and the Prudential Insurance Co. of the United States.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Dismisses SEC Charges Against Blinder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed charges against
penny stock mogul Meyer Blinder, his son and his brokerage, and
chastised the Securities and Exchange Commission for misconduct in
a 1983 civil case.
   U.S. District Judge Lewis Babcock on Wednesday ordered that no
documents or testimony obtained in the case could ever again be
used by the SEC in court against Blinder, his son Larry and
Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co.
   The judge awarded attorney fees to Blinder.
   Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co. was accused of not keeping correct books
and records required by the SEC when securities are traded. The SEC
had sought an immediate injunction against the firm, but a federal
judge ordered a trial.
   Blinder attorney Philip Lowery said the brokerage was going from
a manual system to a computer system in 1983 when the SEC said the
books were out of date.
   The court found that in pretrial actions the SEC had failed to
comply with a court order and had not acted in good faith.
   Robert Davenport, SEC regional administrator in Denver, said he
could not recall such a sanction being imposed on the SEC, which
has 60 days appeal.
   In February, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Blinder's challenge
to the SEC's power to crack down on fraud, stemming from 1980 SEC
sanctions restricting his activities.
   Blinder began his business in Westbury, Long Island, and moved
its headquarters to Denver in the late 1970s. It became one of the
nation's leading underwriters of penny stocks, or low-priced
securities.
   The SEC in 1980 accused Blinder and the firm of deceiving
investors in underwriting a $25 million sale of stock in American
Leisure Corp intended to finance construction and operation of a
casino hotel in Atlantic City, N.J.
   A federal judge in Denver ruled in 1982 the firm defrauded
investors by withholding important information, and barred Blinder
and his firm from engaging in similar practices.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed today in light, choppy trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean futures opened lower in reaction to Wednesday's
6-to-10-day National Weather Service forecast for normal
precipitation next week in the Midwest, then turned slightly higher
in a modest technical rebound.
   Corn futures were mixed with support stemming from signs that
the Soviet Union is seeking to buy some U.S. corn.
   Talk of Soviet buying interest also lent early support to the
wheat market, but a forecast for above-average precipitation next
week in the central and northern Great Plains limited the early
gains.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $4.02{ a bushel; corn was {
cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $2.67} a bushel; oats were
1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with May at $1.79{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1{ cents lower to 2 cents higher with May at $7.26{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .33 cent higher with June at 71.12
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .43 cent higher
with May at 76.15 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .08
cent higher with June at 45.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .40 cent lower to .10 cent higher with May at 33.25 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Wednesday while most pork
futures advanced.

<HEAD>Bush Bailout Plan Goes to Senate Virtually Intact</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Top 8 grafs new to UPDATE with House panel voting to allow banks
to take over S&amp;Ls immediately. Editing throughout to shorten.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House banking subcommittee today amended
President Bush's savings and loan bailout plan to allow banks to
immediately begin buying up both insolvent and healthy thrift
institutions.
   In deference to small banks and the thrift industry, Bush had
proposed allowing banks to buy only ailing S&amp;Ls for the next two
years and healthy ones as well after that.
   But Reps. Stan Parris, R-Va., and Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio,
claimed support from both the administration and the Federal
Reserve for their amendment, which was approved on a voice vote by
the 47-member House Banking Committee's financial institutions
subcommittee.
   ``The one question we are repeatedly asked is what are we doing
to bring more capital into a capital-deficit industry,'' said Rep.
Doug Barnard, D-Ga. ``This is the one thing we can do.''
   Opponents expressed fears that allowing wholesale bank takeovers
of S&amp;Ls will concentrate too much market power in the banks,
decrease the amount of money available for home loans and
ultimately raise the taxpayer share of the bailout's costs.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., predicted that banks will buy only
healthy S&amp;Ls, saying they should at least be required to take over
an insolvent thrift for each financially sound one that they
purchase.
   ``The government is going to be stuck with every unhealthy
thrift in existence and the public's going to be stuck with
additional millions'' of dollars in paying off their depositors,
said the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., who
opposed the amendment.
   While the House panel continued altering Bush's $90 billion
bailout package, the Senate Banking Committee approved it Wednesday
night after bowing to the administration on virtually every major
dispute.
   All 21 members of the panel voted Wednesday to support the
package after its chairman, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.,
lost an 11-10 vote that would have rejected the administration's
proposal for keeping $50 billion in S&amp;L spending out of the budget
deficit.
   Riegle had sought to include the spending in the budget and
borrow the money through the Treasury. He contended that would have
saved taxpayes $4.5 billion in interest payments over 30 years,
compared with Bush's proposal to borrow the money through a new,
quasi-government agency.
   The administration vigorously opposed Riegle's plan, contending
Congress would be tempted to use it to evade deficit limits for
many other programs. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady promised
to recommend a presidential veto if Riegle's plan was adopted.
   The full Senate is scheduled to begin debate on the legislation
Monday, with a vote expected by Wednesday.
   The Senate Banking Committee also passed most of the revisions
sought by Bush to accompany the bailout and prevent a repeat of the
financial crisis.
   The key, according to the administration, is a requirement that
S&amp;L owners back their lending with more of their own capital,
beginning in June 1991. The administration would like to forbid
growth by S&amp;Ls that do not meet the capital standard, but the
committee decided to permit those institutions to grow 5 percent to
7 percent a year through lending in home mortgages.
   ``Obviously we don't like growth for undercapitalized thrifts,''
said Assistant Treasury Secretary David W. Mullins, one of the
architects of the Bush plan. ``We've learned hard lessons from it
in the past.''
   But, overall, he said the Senate capital standard was ``a good
solid approach.''
   The Senate committee also restructured the regulatory
bureaucracy along the lines suggested by the administration,
placing a once-independent S&amp;L regulatory agency under the Treasury
Department.
   However, in an administration-approved compromise, it created a
separate independent agency to oversee the lending function of the
regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which borrow money at low,
government-backed rates and lend it to individual S&amp;Ls.
   The House subcommittee voted 27-16 Wednesday to approve an
amendment by Parris that permits S&amp;Ls to continue using deposits in
subsidiaries investing in risky areas such as commercial real
estate development, fast food franchises and junk bonds.
   The House panel also adopted a measure requiring the government
to offer some of the repossessed property from failed S&amp;Ls for
housing poor people.

<HEAD>Government Reported Probing Pickens Purchase of Koito Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Finance Ministry is investigating a
possible new technical irregularity in the purchase of 32.4 million
shares of a Japanese auto lighting company by U.S. corporate
takeover specialist T. Boone Pickens Jr., news reports said
Thursday.
   The reports said the ministry had discovered that the Azabu Auto
Group, from which Pickens bought his 20.2 percent share in Koito
Manufacturing Co., originally did not report to authorities it had
bought more than a 10 percent interest in the lighting firm.
   Failure to make such a report could be a violation of Japan's
Securities and Exchange Law.
   The news reports said the problem was discovered through
documents furnished by the Azabu Group after the ministry began a
formal inquiry last week into the sale of the shares.
   An official in the Finance Ministry's securities market division
said, ``I can't comment. We are still in the midst of our
investigation.''
   Pickens' purchase of the stock, which makes him the largest
shareholder, has been widely described as a possible ``greenmail''
or takeover attempt.
   In greenmail, a hostile corporate suitor makes his profits when
his stock is purchased at a premium by the target company or
another shareholder friendly to the firm.
   The Azabu Group, which reportedly has targeted other Japanese
companies for greenmail in the past, bought 48 million shares of
Koito in 1988. A large block of those shares was registered under
the name of T. Boone Pickens as of March 31, 1989.
   The second-largest stockholder, Toyota Motor Corp., holds 19.1
percent of Koito's stock.
   Koito said Tuesday it had temporarily suspended the name
transfer registrations for certificates for stock bought by Boone
Co., a Pickens-controlled investment firm, due to another legal
problem.
   A Koito official said Pickens' designate may have filed an
inapproriate application with the Finance Ministry regarding the
purchase by failing to state that the company was involved in the
manufacture of defense-sensitive parts. Koito, officials said, is
engaged in military-related aircraft parts production.
   A Boone Co. spokesman has said its interest in Koito is not
hostile.

   Tax deadline time always compels some Americans
to make financial resolutions aimed at saving more of their
hard-earned bucks for a new house or their children's education.
   Despite their intentions, Uncle Sam isn't coaxing them too much,
since many incentives disappeared when Congress revamped the tax
law three years ago.
   Wall Street firms and banks, seeking new sources of money, have
been lobbying to get those tax breaks back.
   ``The trade-off hasn't worked,'' said Jeffrey M. Schaeffer,
director of research for the Securities Industry Association, a
lobby group of brokerage companies. ``The government thought if you
lowered marginal rates that would create the incentive to save and
invest.
   ``It may well be we have to think that over.''
   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 lowered the maximum individual tax
bracket to 33 percent from 50 percent, but it also eliminated many
deductions and preferential items. The changes included
restrictions on Individual Retirement Accounts and ended the
favorable treatment on capital gains and losses.
   Groups such as the American Bankers Association want the
government to restore IRA benefits so anyone can deduct annual
contributions of up to $2,000. Individuals can still make
tax-deferred contributions but only those who aren't covered by
company pension plans can take the deductions under the revised tax
code.
   The SIA has been keeping busy lately. Its officers testified
before the House Ways and Means Committee this past week that
capital gains on stocks should be taxed differently from ordinary
income. Before tax revision the maximum rate on capital gains had
been 20 percent.
   The group also is pushing for changes in the way stock dividends
are taxed, arguing that the current system imposes what amounts to
a double levy. Not only do stockholders pay taxes on dividends, the
SIA says, but corporations also are taxed since they can't deduct
these payouts from their taxable income the way they can for the
interest on bonds they issue.
   Lobbying groups and others concede that it's doubtful the tax
changes they desire will happen soon.
   ``I don't look for the government to be giving anybody any
breaks in the near future,'' said Jay Goldinger, a principal with
the Beverly Hills, Calif., investment banking firm Capital Insight
Inc. ``It's a reactionary body, not one that anticipates a
problem.''
   Some financial analysts disagree on whether IRA deductions and
preferential capital gains treatment had encouraged non-wealthy
taxpayers to sock more money away in the first place.
   ``I think that the history of tax legislation aimed at spurring
savings has so far been fruitless,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief
economist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., who believes that
changing demographics, not government intervention, will prompt
Americans to save more.
   ``We've had the IRAs. We've reduced the tax rates. Even
inflation has come down thanks to government policies. Yet the
savings rate continued to fall through 1987.''
   The nation's personal savings rate, which pales in comparison
with those in industrial rivals such as Japan and West Germany, has
been declining over the past 20 years after rising during the 1950s
and early '60s.
   In 1987 it hit a 40-year low of 3.2 percent of after-tax income,
then bounced back to 4.2 percent last year.
   The downward trend reflects what economists called poor personal
planning for the future, and they say it could have serious
implications for the economy. The savings rate represents billions
of dollars that can be loaned for reinvestment and business growth.
   Some analysts say big changes have to be made to get people to
save or invest more, especially for things like new homes or a
college education. The government already provides incentives for
those saving for their retirement, offering tax deductions on
things such as employee-sponsored 401k savings plans and Keogh
programs for the self-employed.
   Some groups, though, say more needs to be done to take care of
current needs. The National Association of Home Builders, for
example, would like to see a housing equivalent of IRAs, or
something that would allow the interest on savings to be
tax-deferred if earmarked for the purchase of a house.
   William Schreyer, chairman of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., has proposed
giving IRA savers the right to withdraw money from their accounts
for home ownership, medical care or education, without having to
pay taxes on the proceeds.

<HEAD>Budget Deal Announcement Expected Friday</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2 new grafs for 2nd graf pvs, Bargainers planned, with
negotiations under way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All signs are pointing to a formal
announcement on Friday that White House and congressional
negotiators have agreed on a fiscal 1990 budget bearing a deficit
of about $100 billion.
   Bargainers resumed their private meetings in a Capitol office
today, with the two sides hoping to give final shape to a deal on
the $1.2 trillion spending plan.
   The ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, Rep. Bill
Frenzel of Minnesota, said the plan was to complete work on the
pact today, ``if we have to go all night.''
   The talks broke off early Wednesday evening because some of the
participants had other appointments, but one source knowledgeable
about the sessions said a final agreement could probably have been
reached had the negotiations lasted another 30 minutes.
   Another source said that House leaders have been told to expect
to go to the White House on Friday for a public announcement of a
pact.
   ``I'm very hopeful, actually optimistic that we will have an
agreement this week,'' House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash.,
said after Thursday's meeting.
   Asked if bargainers would go to the White House today for an
announcement of a deal, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser, D-Tenn., said, ``I think we probably will go Friday.''
   The deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, is
expected to surpass $170 billion. But due largely to optimistic
economic assumptions used by the White House _ and accepted by
Congress _ budget writers say they need to find only $28 billion in
savings to chop next year's red ink to $100 billion. The
Gramm-Rudman law would trigger automatic spending cuts if the
deficit surpasses that amount by more than $10 billion.
   Some lawmakers are already acknowledging that the talks will not
produce the profound budget reductions that some legislators,
economists and others say are necessary to take a meaningful bite
out of the government's fiscal problems.
   ``I don't think anybody's expectations ought to be driven to the
point of expecting a dramatic and breathtaking announcement,'' said
Foley.
   The deal would achieve half of its savings by reducing
anticipated spending, and half by raising revenues.
   Tentative revenue agreements include nearly $6 billion by
selling federal assets, $5.6 billion from new taxes and much of the
rest from raising fees for various government services.
   President Bush pledged during last fall's campaign not to raise
taxes, and battles between him and the Democratic-controlled
Congress can be expected over where the new taxes will come from.
   Bush has favored reducing the capital gains tax, which he says
would stimulate the economy and raise revenues next year by $4.8
billion. Democrats say the proposal is a money-losing boon to the
rich.
   In the spending area, more than $7 billion would come from
slowing the rate of growth in programs that automatically provide
benefits to recipients, such as a savings of more than $2.5 billion
in the Medicare program that provides health care for the elderly.
   Accounting gimmicks are expected to provide much of the
remaining savings, such as $2 billion in savings by moving the U.S.
Postal Service ``off-budget.''
   Defense spending would be about $300 billion, approximately the
same as Bush proposed in the budget he presented to Congress in
February.
   Once an agreement is announced, Congress would have to enact a
budget resolution containing the pact's language, a process
expected to take weeks. By law, that resolution _ which does not
need the president's signature _ is supposed to be completed by
April 15. The deadline is never achieved, and there is no legal
penalty for that failure.
   Even with a resolution in place, separate bills would have to be
passed to actually enact the spending and taxing decisions reached
this week. That work will take months, and probably will not be
finished until at least the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 1990.

<TEXT>
   Dow Chemical Co. said Thursday it would
repurchase 12 million of its shares now that it has completed a
previous 10 million share buyback.
   Dow Chemical has bought more than 30 million shares of its own
stock through 10 repurchase programs since 1983. At the end of 1988
there were 183.5 million shares outstanding.
   Companies generally buy back stock to reduce the number of
shares outstanding and increase the value of shares left on the
market.
   Dow Chemical stock was priced at $87.75 a share at the end of
1988 and has been in the mid-$90 range since then. It traded at
$92.12{, down 62{ cents, in early New York Stock Exchange trading
Thursday.
   No time limit was set for the new repurchase program.

   The stock market drifted lower today as traders
warily awaited the latest reading on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.08 to
2,309.57 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 457 up, 788 down and
550 unchanged.
   The government is due to report Friday on the producer price
index of finished goods for March, along with several other
economic statistics.
   Analysts expect the price index to show an increase of about 0.5
percent, down from 1.0 percent in both January and February.
   That would provide at least a tentative bit of evidence that a
slowing economy was reducing upward pressure on inflation and
interest rates.
   In a new bit of evidence that business activity is indeed
slackening, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales
increased a scant 0.1 percent last month, following a
downwnward-revised 0.6 percent decline in February.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1{ at 109|; Philip Morris, down 1{ at 118];
Coca-Cola, down | at 51\, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down
[ at 31[.
   Freeport-McMoRan jumped 3[ to 36~. The company said it began a

   Teledyne fell 2] to 348. The company reported first-quarter
earnings of $6.32 a share, down from $12.79 in the comparable
period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .47 to 167.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index slipped .24 to 333.99.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 70.12 million shares at

   Formica Corp. announced Thursday it has

group which will pay about $365 million in cash for the laminated
products company.
   The agreement does not allow Formica to accept offers from other
companies.
   The $19-per-share bid by FM Acquisition Corp. includes the

   Formica announced Monday that it rejected a $243 million

<HEAD>Big Expansion Foreseen in Unattended Gas Stations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Those credit-card slurping electronic creatures that can do your
banking and spit out airline tickets at the departure gate are
moving onto roadways to fill your tank, and could become the
primary auto fueling pits of tomorrow.
   ``Phantom'' or ``ghost'' stations, as they are sometimes called,
are appearing across Texas, Arizona and Minnesota, beckoning
motorists with cheaper prices and signs like First Fuel Bank and
Auto Fuel Co.
   Like self-service stations two decades ago, these computerized,
people-free stations have been spreading slowly. But experts
predict their use nationwide is inevitable.
   ``There's no question about it. It's going to be a very big part
of gas marketing in the future,'' says David Morehead, spokesman
for the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, which
represents about 10,000 U.S. retailers and wholesalers. ``It's the
next logical step in the process.''
   Unattended fueling is nothing new but until recently, fire codes
restricted it to private and commercial users.
   Arizona fire inspector Burt Wright was a pioneer in pushing for
changes that opened unattended fueling to the public two years ago.
   A study that led to the revision of national fire codes showed
that ``safety records were best at service stations with no
attendants and worst at those stations where an attendant did the
pumping,'' Wright says.
   ``At an unattended pump, there is total attention to one thing _
pumping gas. You're not usually distracted by pumping gas into two
or three different cars or checking oil or tires,'' he says.
   In the 1960s when attended self-service stations were
controversial, the fear was consumer carelessness could lead to
explosions and fires. But Wright's study produced no evidence to
support that fear.
   ``It's the public who's pumping the gas in the private locations
and that's OK but it's not OK for them to do it in a public
location? That's absurd,'' he says.
   New fire codes set specifications for equipment, including
automatic shutoffs in case of accidents, and special alarm systems,
including telephones to tap into emergency locations. They require
regular inspections, and prominent posting of operating and
emergency instructions.
   Cynthia Condon, vice president of Pacific Pride Services Inc. of
Salem, Ore., which caters to commercial fleets in six western
states, believes the time is right for unattended fueling.
   ``People have come to trust machines over people,'' she says.
   Moreover, consumers have come a long way from the days of brand
loyalty. Prices now dictate consumer preference and the elimination
of people means lower costs and more competitive pricing.
   First Fuel Bank Inc. in St. Cloud, Minn., for example, normally
prices its gasoline 2 to 5 cents below rivals, founder Jim Feneis
says.
   Ghost stations operate much like automated bank tellers or
computerized airline ticketing machines at airports. Customers
insert a plastic credit card, punch in an identification number and
pump the gas. At the end of the month, they receive a sophisticated
statement, much like a bank statement.
   Opposition to unattended fueling has come primarily from service
station owners.
   ``They're dead set against it basically because it's going to
put several of them out of a job,'' says Jim Egan, fire protection
design technician for the City of Tucson, which allows unattended
fueling.
   Although the business is now dominated by independents, major
oil companies are window shopping.
   ``Arco and Exxon came into town and asked if we would allow it
about a year ago and asked for a list of all the closed up
stations,'' Wright says.
   For now, the independents are enjoying life without the majors.
   Auto Fuel Co., based in Abilene, Texas, has 18 stations in Texas
and Arizona, and is acquiring abandoned service station sites in
the Sun Belt, says Roger Bryant, vice president of operations. Auto
Fuel plans to open 600 ghost stations in the next few years.
   The biggest boon to marketers may be new federal regulations
requiring tougher standards on underground storage tanks and $1
million minimum insurance, even for the smallest tank owners.
   ``The reality for most of the small operators, is they can't
afford it,'' says Morehead.
   A survey last year showed that many owners could afford to
upgrade tanks, but more than 27,000 stations will close because of
the insurance costs, Morehead says.
   Pioneers in unattended retailing say that by the time tank
owners spend the money to upgrade their equipment, they will be
able to operate as a fully automated system.
   Feneis is using the new regulations as a marketing tool to lure
commercial fleets, offering to buy and remove existing equipment if
the fleet signs up as a First Fuel customer.
   Like self-service stations, ghost stations have been slow to
catch on. In 1972, self serve represented only 2 percent of the
industry; today, it represents 80 percent, industry figures show.
   Statistics are scarce on the number of unattended retailers. The
American Petroleum Institute, which represents major oil producers
and refiners, says the numbers are ``very small'' and that the
concept is experimental.
   Robert N. Renkes, executive vice president of Petroleum
Equipment Institute in Tulsa, Okla., says that while sales are up
on card-operated equipment, states will act slowly in tailoring
their fire codes to national codes. New Jersey and Oregon don't
even allow attended self-service yet, he says.
   For now, the two biggest questions involve profitability and
public acceptance.
   ``The equipment is there. The equipment is safe. Everything is
ready. Now the marketer has to figure out if he can make a go of
it,'' says Renkes, who believes unattended makes good economic
sense, particularly in remote locations.
   ``As the minimum wage rises and fringe benefits become costlier,
it will cost more to have attendant operations,'' he says.
   L.W. Locke, owner and president of Eastern Petroleum Corp., in
Enfield, N.C., doesn't believe ghost stations can be profitable
catering to the general public alone. Locke won't sign up any
customer using less than $500 of gas a month. Feneis in Minnesota
believes if you offer the right price, you'll get a profitable
balance of public and commericial customers.
   But will the public accept them? Many convenience store-gasoline
station operators say no. They believe people want food along with
fuel. But ghost marketers like Feneis believe enough people prefer
lower gasoline prices and fast, convenient service 24 hours a day
all year round.
   Bryant's Auto Fuel is taking the safe route, placing ghost pumps
in strategic areas and cutting expenses by sharing property costs.
   ``We share the real estate, like a fast food place or a quick
lube, but they don't share our business,'' Bryant says.
   He predicts ghost pumps will begin appearing in unconventional
places _ ``perhaps outside a florist shop or anyplace where there
is unused real estate.''

   If you ask Jim Feneis, he'll say First Fuel is the only way to
go once you've done it.
   First Fuel Bank Inc. of St. Cloud, Minn., is one of a growing
number of unattended, card-operated gasoline stations _ with a big
difference.
   It dispenses gasoline at competitive prices along with the
opportunity for customers to shelter themselves against higher fuel
costs.
   ``We're the first marketer in the country offering price-locked
future purchases to the end user _ like a futures market,'' Feneis
said in a telephone interview.
   He is president and co-founder with brother Dan of First Fuel
Bank, where customers make cash deposits for predetermined amounts
of gasoline and lock in the price on the day of purchase.
   The amount is recorded in a computerized account and customers
receive a card programmed for any of the company's outlets for a $1
one-time fee.
   ``You decide how much of a deposit you want to put into your
account,'' says Feneis. ``You can lock it in for the next day, the
next week or the next five years.''
   FFB's commercial and retail customers take delivery whenever
their tanks run dry or until they've used up their prepaid amount,
when the computer automatically shuts down.
   FFB's pay-in-advance system means the company has no bad credit
problems and people-free sites save on labor costs, so FFB can
offer competitive prices and still make money.
   ``The two biggest enemies of a retail marketer is loss due to
wasted labor and loss due to bad credit,'' says Feneis.
   Owning its own freight service and large storage facilities
helps cut down on overhead expenses.
   ``If operated correctly you can shave 20 percent off normal
costs,'' Feneis says.
   Cards issued to FFB customers operate the gas pumps, similar to
automated bank teller machines. Each time customers draw from their
account, the amount is deducted, much like withdrawing from a
checking or savings account.
   At the end of the month, customers receive a sophisticated
statement showing the time of day and type of vehicle fueled, the
odometer reading and who bought the gas. It also enables users to
figure miles-per-gallon for each tankful of gasoline and each
vehicle for the month. The system also can be custom-designed to
allow fueling only once a day, for example.
   Fleet managers who first accepted the statements as a luxury,
now insist they are a necessity, Feneis says. Besides eliminating
pilferage, the accounting system gives fleet managers maximum
control of their gas purses.
   ``I tell the customer our system can account for every drop of
the company's fuel,'' he says.
   Recently, FFB's price was 90.9 cents a gallon for all grades of
gasoline. At nearby attended self-serve stations, prices were 93.9
cents for unleaded and 95.9 for regular.
   About 80 percent of First Fuel customers are private motorists
and 20 percent are fleet accounts.
   Feneis, 34, and his brother, 28, opened their first unattended
automated site in 1982.
   Since then, FFB's customer base has grown from four family
members to 4,200 accounts, including about 14,000 vehicles. Today
it has three fueling sites, 54 hoses and a fourth site planned.
   Along the way, Feneis had to live down the jibes of self-service
competitors who said the un-peopled sites would never catch on.
When they did, he was challenged by the Minnesota Service Station
Association.
   He also had to figure out a way around Minnesota law, which
doesn't allow unattended operations open to the ``general public.''
   He did it by making each customer a member of a private club,
which is technically legal.
   New customers are taken through a training program to learn
safety procedures and how to operate the pumps and emergency
equipment.
   ``They have to sign something saying you're now your own
attendant. So if fuel is being dispensed there, there is an
attendant there,'' Feneis says.

<HEAD>ConAgra, FTC Reach Agreement on Holly Farms Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ConAgra Inc. said Thursday it has agreed to
divest a portion of Holly Farms Corp.'s flour milling operation if
it succeeds in a $1 billion buyout of its poultry-industry
competitor.
   The agreement with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission
would require ConAgra to divest 2.4 million pounds of Holly Farms'
daily flour milling capacity if the merger is completed, ConAgra
spokesman Walt Casey said.
   In return, the FTC staff will not recommend commission action to
block the merger, Casey said.
   The agreement requires divestiture within 15 months after the
FTC consent decree process, which should take about 10 weeks.
   Until the divestiture is complete, the Holly Farms flour milling
business will be held separate from ConAgra and operated
independently, ConAgra said.
   Holly Farms, of Memphis, Tenn., has a total flour milling
capacity of 5.5 million pounds a day, while ConAgra's capacity is
26 million pounds, Casey said.
   ConAgra has been locked in a bitter fight with Tyson Foods of
Springdale, Ark., over the poultry producer.
   In a hostile bid, Tyson offered $63.50 a share, or a total of
$1.15 billion, for Holly Farms. ConAgra has offered a stock
exchange valued at about $1.07 billion.
   Holly Farms stockholders were scheduled to vote on the merger
proposals Friday. A ConAgra vote was scheduled for later that day.

   London Stock Echange prices shrugged off
potentially worrisome data showing an acceleration in the
underlying rate of increase of British average earnings to close
only slightly lower Thursday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
4.3 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,028.7. At its best, the index was
down 1.6 points at late afternoon, after having dropped 14.9 points
at mid-morning.
   Light volume of 463.0 million shares was little changed from
Wednesday's 467.9 million shares.
   While the implications of the data could still return to haunt
the market, dealers said there was a lack of selling pressure as
participants awaited much more important economic statistics due
Friday.
   Those include the British retail price index for March, followed
later in the day by the U.S. producer price index for March and the
U.S. trade report for February.
   Thursday figures showed that average earnings in Britain grew at
an underlying annual rate of 9\ percent in February, compared with
9 percent in January.
   The figures were ``unequivocal bad news,'' said Robin Aspinall,
a market analyst at Schroder Securities. But he said Friday ``is a
much more important day. There is hardly anybody out there who is
daring to sell.''

   The U.S. dollar fell against the major currencies
in lively European trading Thursday. Gold prices were higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers said a West German cabinet change and
Swiss interest rate rises boosted European currencies.
   The replacement of West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg by Theo Waigel spurred European currencies because
Waigel opposes the 10 percent withholding tax on interest income.
   The tax has seen investment money leaving the country since it
was imposed Jan. 1.
   After the Swiss National Bank raised interest rates, the Swiss
franc became more attractive to investors and it rose sharply
against the dollar.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7010 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.6925.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Wednesday's late rates: 1.8720 West German marks, down from 1.8857;
1.6422 Swiss francs, down from 1.6645; 6.3335 French francs, down
from 6.3690; 2.1080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1270; 1,374.00
Italian lire, down from 1,381.00; 1.1875 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1887.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar slipped to 132.80 Japanese yen from
132.85 yen on Wednesday. In London late Thursday the dollar was
trading lower at 132.35.
   In London, gold traded late at a bid price of $388.75 a troy
ounce, up from $387.25 late Wednesday. The late Zurich bid price
was $389.15, up from $387.30.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $387.75 bid, up from $384.15.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.87 a troy

   Big Three automaker sales shot up 26.5 percent in
early April, when incentives were in full force, compared with last
year when the deals had expired, the companies said Thursday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
cars and light trucks sold at an average daily rate of 34,931
during the April 1-10 period this year, compared with a rate of
27,621 last year.
   Car sales soared 27.6 percent and sales of light trucks were up
24.6 percent during the period.
   Late last month, Ford and GM announced new incentive packages
featuring 2.9 percent interest on two-year loans and increased
rebates. Chrysler got into the fray April 3, going one step further
to interest-free financing on two-year loans for all of its cars.
   While incentives surely contributed to some of the early April
sales boom, some of the increase is attributable to slow sales
during the period last year. Incentives in effect during the first
quarter of 1988 expired March 31, persuading consumers planning
spring or summer purchases to make them earlier.
   March and April typically are hot car-selling months as
Americans get ready for summer vacations. But March sales were
lower than expected, giving rise to the new incentive packages.
   Car and truck sales by the Big Three so far this year were
running 6.9 percent behind last year's pace, going to a daily rate
of 33,068 vehicles, compared with 35,535 between Jan. 1 and April
10 last year.
   Ford said its car sales rocketed to a daily rate of 7,896 during
early April, up 47 percent from 5,372 the same time last year. For
the year, Ford's car sales were running at a rate 0.4 percent below
last year's.
   Sales of Ford's light trucks rose 28.2 percent for the period
but fell 3.2 percent for the year.
   Early-April car sales at GM rose 20.8 percent to a daily rate of
10,764, compared with 8,911 last year. GM's car sales for the year
through April 10 were 12.1 percent behind last year's rate.
   GM's light trucks sold in early April at a rate 25.9 percent
above last year and were down 4.2 percent for the year.
   Chrysler said its early-April car sales rose 12.4 percent to a
daily rate of 3,180, compared with a 2,830 last year. Year-to-date
sales ran 19.1 percent behind last year's rate.
   On the truck side, Chrysler's sales in early April were running
17.2 percent ahead of last year's pace, and for the year were up
2.1 percent.

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. on Thursday
reported first quarter earnings jumped 18 percent over the same
1988 period in part because of especially strong sales increases in
plastics appliances.
   GE reported net income of $849 million, or 94 cents a share, on
revenue of $11.9 billion. That compares to earnings of $725
million, or 80 cents a share, on $10.5 billion in revenue a year
earlier.
   The revenue rise includes a 17 percent increase in the company's
GE Financial Services division. Its revenue was $2.8 billion in the
quarter compared to $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 1988.
   ``Sales increases were particularly strong in plastic,
appliances, industrial and power systems, and broadcasting, with
plastics and appliances helped somewhat by the Borg-Warner and and
Roper acquisitions,'' GE Chairman John F. Welch Jr. said.
   GE last year acquired Borg-Warner Corp. for $2.3 billion and
Roper Corp. for about $507 million.

<HEAD>Ueberroth's Bid Flops After Tumultuous Bargaining</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: LEADS with new grafs 1-7 to UPDATE with comments today by Lorenzo
and Ueberroth; picks up 3rd graf pvs, The judge ...</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Now that his $464 million deal with Peter V.
Ueberroth has collapsed, Eastern Airlines boss Frank Lorenzo said
today he is turning his attention to his plan to reorganize Eastern
as a much smaller airline.
   ``We've had our deal. We've looked at the sale alternatives,''
Lorenzo said in a speech at the University Club in Manhattan.
   Under his new plan, strikebound Eastern ``will be a lot
smaller,'' said Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air
Corp. However, he asserted, ``We are not going to have any
difficulty over time building back.''
   At a separate speaking engagement a few blocks away, Ueberroth
said in response to a question on the Eastern situation, ``We're
out of there, for sure.''
   The former baseball commissioner said he had not been in touch
with any of the parties involved, including Lorenzo, Texas Air and
bankruptcy court officials. He would not try to get in touch with
them and did not expect to hear from them, Ueberroth told a
reporter after his speech on sports issues.
   The statements by Ueberroth and Lorenzo came the day after they
announced their deal had fallen apart, thwarting efforts to restore
sickly Eastern to a full flying schedule.
   The announcements Wednesday came after tumultuous negotiations
between Ueberroth aides and Texas Air reached an impasse at federal
bankruptcy court in Manhattan.
   The judge overseeing the case moved immediately to attract other
buyers.
   ``Our agreement with Texas Air is terminated, it's finished,
it's over,'' Ueberroth told reporters.
   The ex-baseball commissioner, who had described the Eastern deal
as an historic opportunity for business-labor cooperation when it
was announced April 6, said his investor group did not plan to make
a new offer.
   But Charles Bryan, head of Eastern's Machinists union, said in
several television interviews today he thought Ueberroth was still
in the picture. ``Peter Ueberroth has said (it's over) a couple of
times in the past during these negotiations.''
   Bryan said Ueberroth ``could very well come back'' with another
offer despite remarks to the contrary.
   Ueberroth's dramatic entry as a bidder for Eastern and
just-as-dramatic departure injected new uncertainty into prospects
for an airline that has been largely idled and losing millions of
dollars since its employees struck March 4.
   His withdrawal doused hopes among many strikers Wednesday that a
strong new leader had emerged to take control of an airline they
claim has been butchered by Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo since
he bought it three years ago.
   ``I'm disappointed to say the least,'' said Wally Haber, a
Machinist Union official in Eastern's home base of Miami. ``I can
tell you right now, Mr. Lorenzo would have walked away in this deal
with a lot more money than he put into Eastern Airlines. Obviously
they've got some plans to milk some more out of Eastern.''
   The Air Line Pilots Association in Washington said the union was
disappointed and said the problems that caused the strike remained.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland had sought unsuccessfully
to salvage the deal after talks bogged down but Ueberroth and
Lorenzo walked out of the talks Tuesday night hours before a
self-imposed midnight deadline, sources familiar with the
negotiations said.
   After Ueberroth formally announced the deal failed, Lifland
ordered David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner overseeing
the bankruptcy, to meet Friday with him, Eastern's creditors and
the union representatives.
   The judge also ordered them to explain on Monday why he
shouldn't invite other bids for Eastern that would include major
assets it owned before Lorenzo bought the airline in 1986 for about
$676 million.
   The order is based on a petition by an Eastern creditor, Atlanta
attorney Moreton Rolleston Jr., that seeks to block the proposed
sale of Eastern's Northeast shuttle for $365 million to developer
Donald Trump. Eastern has moved to have the judge allow the sale to
go through.
   The petition also seeks to require that any purchase of Eastern
be for $615 million; include all of its System One computerized
reservation system, which it sold to Texas Air; and include
aircraft it has transferred to sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   Lorenzo put Eastern under bankruptcy protection five days after
the strike began and has been trying to peddle the airline since,
but it was unclear late Wednesday whether he would accept new
offers.
   Takeover speculator Carl Icahn, chairman of rival Trans World
Airlines, said after the Ueberroth deal collapsed that he remained
interested in a possible bid but did not elaborate.
   In addition, a Manhattan diamond dealer, Willy Censor, said
Wednesday he had formed a partnership with an unidentified foreign
airline that he said could raise more than $250 million to make a
bid. Eastern attorneys declined to comment on whether the airline
considered him a serious suitor.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes told reporters the airline planned
to reorganize as a vastly shrunken carrier operating about half its
pre-strike schedule of 1,040 flights daily with about half the
pre-strike work force of 31,000 people.
   The collapse of the Ueberroth deal came less than a week after
he said his investor group would acquire Eastern and a 19.9 percent
stake in the System One reservations system in a deal valued at
$464 million. Employees would have owned 30 percent of the company
in exchange for $210 million worth of wage and benefit concessions.
   The deal appeared almost assured Monday when Ueberroth won
5-year labor commitments from the unions. But it began to unravel
over their insistence that a court-appointed outsider run the
airline regardless of whether Ueberroth's bid succeeded. Sources
speaking privately said Lorenzo balked at that demand.
   In another development Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Edward
Davis in Miami ruled that Eastern pilots were within their rights
to honor the strike, which was instigated by the Machinists union.
Eastern said it would appeal the ruling, claiming the pilot walkout
was illegal.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Gain On Talk Of Soviet Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices closed moderately higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid persistent rumors that
the Soviet Union had purchased a large quantity of U.S. wheat for
near-term delivery.
   Oat futures advanced in a rebound from the previous session's
losses while other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly
mixed.
   Similar rumors of wheat-buying by the Soviets had swept through
the market on Wednesday, causing prices to rise. But prices slipped
in early trading Thursday following a National Weather Service
forecast for rain next week in some key winter-wheat growing areas
of the United States.
   Talk of a Soviet wheat purchase surfaced again Thursday
afternoon. Traders bid up the price of wheat for May delivery, but
the buying interest in contracts for later deliveries of wheat was
more restrained.
   The National Weather Service's prediction for normal
precipiation in most of the Midwest last week weighed on corn and
soybean prices.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 6 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.09 a bushel; corn was 1} cents
lower to } cent higher with May at $2.68{ a bushel; oats were 2{
cents to 5 cents higher with May at $1.84 a bushel; soybeans were 2

<HEAD>First Quarter Profit Off at Chemical Banking, Up at Bank of NY</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical Banking Corp., the nation's
sixth-largest banking company, said Thursday its first-quarter
profit slipped 6.8 percent from a year ago, but earnings rose
sharply at another banking concern, Bank of New York Co. Inc.
   Chemical said the decline in its earnings reflected lower
profits from foreign exchange and bond trading and the absence of a
substantial gain on the sale of investment securities reported in
the first quarter of 1988.
   It said its net interest income and corporate finance fees were
higher and it had a lower provision for loan losses.
   Chemical said it earned $117.9 million in the three months ended
March 31, down from $125.5 million a year earlier. Earnings per
share fell even more steeply to $1.49 from $1.95, reflecting the
issuance of 7 million shares in December 1988.
   Net interest income rose 3.1 percent to $597.8 million,
including $17.6 million in payments recognized from loans to
Brazil. The 1988 figures included no interest income on Chemical's
medium and long-term loans to Brazil because Brazil had suspended
such payments from February 1987 through November 1988.
   Securities trading profits fell 15 percent to $27.8 million in
the quartter and foreign exchange trading profits fell 21.5 percent
to $27 million.
   Chemical recorded a $600,000 loss on investment securities sales
in the latest quarter, in contrast with a gain of $25.6 million a
year ago.
   The results include operations of Horizon Bancorp of New Jersey,
which was acquired in a merger Jan. 3. Horizon has been renamed
Chemical Bank New Jersey.
   Chemical's assets amounted to $74 billion on March 31, down from
$78.7 billion a year earlier, reflecting sale of some businesses
that no longer fit into its strategic direction.
   Bank of New York, which became the nation's 10th largest banking
concern with its acquisition late last year of Irving Bank Corp.,
said its earnings rose to nearly $101.1 million in the first
quarter, up 86 percent from $54.4 million a year earlier. Earnings
per share fell to $1.45 from $1.60, however, as the number of
shares outstanding nearly doubled due to the acquisition.
   ``These results exceeded our plan, but they reflect only a small
part of the cost savings arising from the merger,'' J. Carter
Bacot, chairman and chief executive, said. ``Further savings will
be realized as the year progresses.''
   He said lending activities grew strongly, especially in
commercial and industrial loans. Income from non-interest
activities including securities processing grew.
   Bank of New York's assets climbed to $47.9 billion from $22.7
billion before the merger.

   Eastern Airlines management's claims that the
debt-ridden company can return from bankruptcy as a significant
carrier without a new owner or its striking unions met with
skepticism Thursday from labor leaders and some analysts.
   Company officials say their goal is to rebuild Eastern as a
smaller, more efficient carrier, but some analysts say that might
not satisfy the airline's creditors and a sale still might be the
only alternative.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes, announcing the collapse of a $464
million buyout proposal by former baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth, said Wednesday the company envisions gradually
rebuilding to a carrier with about 18,000 employees and 130 to 150
jetliners flying to 60 to 80 cities.
   That would be down from a pre-strike workforce of 30,000 flying
250 planes to 110 cities but larger than its present 4,500
employees and flight schedule amounting to 10 percent of pre-strike
operations.
   ``We are going to continue to bring in new recruits and continue
to build our system,'' said Bakes.
   A March 4 strike by Eastern's Machinists, joined by its pilots
and flight attendants, virtually grounded the airline and forced it
to seek bankruptcy court protection from creditors while it
attempts to resolve its problems.
   Union leaders scoffed at Bakes' statement that Eastern could
bring in enough recruits to replace its strikers.
   Analysts said negative publicity over the strike _ which already
has cost Eastern some future customers _ and proposed restructuring
plans may hinder Eastern's chances of climbing out from $2.5
billion in debts and a decade of nearly steady losses.
   A smaller airline couldn't generate enough revenues to satisfy
creditors, they said. Either new ownership or a liquidation sale of
Eastern's assets are more realistic, some analysts said.
   ``Creditors face reduced risk in a liquidation,'' said Robert
Decker, airline analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps. ``If Eastern is brought
back to life, creditors continue to face the risk of their
investment.''
   Wally Haber, a general chairman for the Machinists union,
claimed Thursday that a decline in passenger traffic last month at
Eastern's sister carrier, Houston-based Continental Airlines,
indicated consumer distrust of Frank Lorenzo, chairman of parent
Texas Air Corp.
   Although Continental added flights on Eastern routes during the
strike's first month, its revenue passenger miles fell 4.3 percent
from March 1988. Continental traffic was down 7.4 percent in the
first three months of this year compared to 1988.
   ``The people aren't flocking to Continental because of the
public image Mr. Lorenzo has made for himself,'' Haber contended.
   Lorenzo got Continental's union contracts abrogated in 1983 and
brought the carrier out of Chapter 11 reorganization as a major
carrier.
   But Haber said a rebuilding Eastern would face an industrywide
shortage of pilots and mechanics that didn't exist six years ago.
Eastern could subcontract Machinists' work and apparently has done
so with some foreign companies, Haber said.
   ``But I don't know where Mr. Bakes is going to get his pilots,''
Haber said.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said it was ``very premature'' to
discuss rebuilding plans.
   Eastern says it has been recalling non-union workers and had
rebuilt its workforce to 4,500 from a low of 1,000 during the first
week of the strike. The company had 12,000 non-union employees when
the strike began and officials said they don't know how many will
be willing to return.
   Eastern has 115 or 116 flights daily after resuming service on
Bahamas and Atlanta routes this week, spokesman James Ashlock said.
The company has concentrated on its most profitable routes, mainly
its Northeastern shuttle service and Latin American service, in its
strike schedule.
   The airline has agreed to sell the shuttle to developer Donald
Trump for $365 million.
   Only 200 of 3,600 pilots have flown since their union joined the
Machinists strike.
   The company still hopes to gain a federal appellate court order
sending the pilots back to work, even though U.S. District Judge
Edward B. Davis on Wednesday reported to a appeals court that there
was no evidence to support company claims the pilots are on an
illegal strike.
   Ashlock said 34 newly recruited pilots are in the third week of
a six-week training course, 34 more are in the second week, and a
third class would begin next week.
   So far, Eastern hasn't had to hire any mechanics to replace
striking Machinists, Ashlock said.

   Stock prices recorded a broad loss today as
traders warily awaited the latest reading on inflation.
   Analysts said a weak dollar in foreign exchange and rising
open-market interest rates helped set the tone for the day.
   The government is due to report Friday on the producer price
index of finished goods for March, along with several other
economic statistics.
   Analysts expect the price index to show an increase of about 0.5
percent, down from 1.0 percent in both January and February.
   That would provide at least a tentative bit of evidence that a
slowing economy was reducing upward pressure on inflation and
interest rates.
   In a new bit of evidence that business activity is indeed
slackening, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales
increased a scant 0.1 percent last month, following a
downwnward-revised 0.6 percent decline in February.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $1.33 Billion in Latest Week</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Assets of the nation's 464 money market mutual
funds rose $1.33 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $302.51 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $1.16 billion increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The increase, from the previous record of $301.2 billion set
last week, marked the 14th straight weekly all-time high for the
funds' assets and reflected the growing attraction of such
investments due to rising interest rates.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 231 general purpose funds rose $977.5 million to $99.60
billion, assets of 94 broker-dealer funds increased $464.5 million
to $129.86 billion, and assets of 139 institutional funds declined
$111.4 million to $73.06 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 9.14 percent from 9.08 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 9.04 percent from 8.97 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
32 days, up from 31 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was 6.61
percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield on six-month
certificates of deposit was 9.34 percent, up from 9.27 percent the
previous week. Yields were 9.50 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 9.45
percent; 9.32 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 9.31 percent; and
9.21 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged.

   The stock market suffered a broad setback
Thursday as traders warily awaited the latest temperature reading
on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 23.65 points to
2,296.00.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
456 up, 1,005 down and 501 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 141.59 million
shares, against 146.83 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 168.22 million shares.
   Analysts said a weak dollar in foreign exchange and rising
open-market interest rates helped to set the tone for the day.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell about $5 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   The government is due to report Friday on the producer price
index of finished goods for March, along with several other
economic statistics.
   Analysts expect the price index to show an increase of about 0.5
percent, down from 1.0 percent in both January and February. That

   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1~ at 109\; Philip Morris, down 2] at 117{;
Coca-Cola, down 1\ at 50|, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down

   An exception was General Electric, which rose \ to 45\ on word
that the company's first quarter earnings increased to 94 cents a

   Teledyne fell 3~ to 346{. The company reported first-quarter
earnings of $6.32 a share, down from $12.79 in the comparable

   J.P. Morgan dropped 1{ to 35} on top of a 1\-point drop
Thursday, when the company reported a larger quarterly earnings
decline than analysts had expected.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

<HEAD>Move Over Ted Turner: NBC Launches Cable Channel</HEAD>

   The National Broadcasting Co., operator of
the top-rated television network in prime time, takes a bold step
into cable TV Monday with the debut of a 24-hour consumer-oriented
business news channel.
   CNBC, the Consumer News and usiness Channel, will be available
to 13 million cable subscribers, or roughly one out of seven U.S.
households with television and one in three with cable service.
   The cable operators who have signed up for the round-the-clock
service say NBC brings a wealth of programming experience and they
contend the entire cable industry will benefit.
   But other cable operators are waiting to see the new network in
action before committing themselves, and cable rival Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. suspects NBC's long-range cable plans go
beyond just business news.
   In any case, the debut at 6 a.m. EDT Monday promises to be the
second most successful cable launch, trailing only Turner's TNT
channel, which offers mostly movies and started with 17 million
subscribers last October. TNT now claims 26 million subscribers.
   CNBC's one-hour morning show will be hosted by Dave Walker and
Lois Hart, the husband-and-wife team that had hosted the
Turner-owned Cable News Network's prime evening news for nine years.
   CNBC also will feature half-hourly market reports, interviews
with money managers, consumer-product demonstrations and buying
tips.
   At night, the ``CNBC Live'' program will follow a format similar
to the network's morning show. Also planned are a personal finance
show with a studio audience and calls from viewers and interview
shows hosted by Dick Cavett and political analyst John McLaughlin.
   ``CNBC Live'' contributors will range from legal expert Arthur
Miller to Ferdie Pacheco, the ring physician of boxing great
Muhammed Ali.
   On weekends, CNBC will air original programming aimed at women
and children mixed with weekly wrapups.
   This won't be the first broadcast company involvement in cable,
but it may be the most active connection between broadcast and
cable.
   The owner of the ABC network has stakes in the ESPN, Lifetime
and Arts &amp; Entertainment cable networks. NBC also has a passive
investment in Arts &amp; Entertainment.
   Larry Gerbrandt, a cable industry analyst for the research firm
Paul Kagan Associates Inc., based in Carmel, Calif., said the CNBC
experience may demonstrate ``how finely can we slice up a niche and
still make money.''
   Gerbrandt estimates NBC will spend $50 million to $75 million
before CNBC becomes profitable, a development that CNBC executives
expect by 1993, when they hope to have about 30 million subscribers.
   If CNBC succeeds, Gerbrandt said ``it may be that consumers are
ready for more narrowly targeted networks'' that will further
strain channel capacities for many cable operators.
   NBC President Robert Wright's interest in the cable business was
well-known long before the company announced last spring that it
planned the new network.
   The original strategy called for daytime business news and
sports at night and on weekends, drawing on NBC's vast resources in
gathering information.
   Analysts noted that it would enable NBC to spread the costs of
news-gathering and sports rights over a broader base wile helping
the network recapture audiences that all three networks have been
losing to cable and independent television stations.
   NBC's cable venture also reflects a broader trend toward
diversification in the media business. Time Inc., Hachette SA of
France and News Corp. of Australia have been seeking new outlets as
well.
   But NBC's initial plan for sports was eventually eliminated from
the CNBC project after cable operators told NBC they had enough
sports programming, CNBC President Michael Eskridge said.
   That left business news, and NBC executives felt their
consumer-oriented, full-time approach would be unique.
   There already was one competitor, the Financial News Network,
but Eskridge said FNN's programming appeared targeted at investors
who follow the markets.
   Richard Feldman, director of research for NBC's cable
subsidiary, said NBC was more interested in appealing to the
estimated 50 million adults who use banking services but don't own
securities.
   Business news shows on cable and broadcast outlets have
multiplied in recent years, ranging from public television's The
Nightly Business Report to CNN's Moneyline.
   Eskridge described CNBC's role this way: ``Everyone does what we
do some of the time. We will do it all the time.''
   His crew will be doing it from two studios in a new office
building located in this New Jersey suburb, a 45-minute taxi ride
from NBC's midtown Manhattan headquarters.
   CNBC eventually will employ 275 staffers, draw occasionally on
reports from NBC network staffers and NBC affiliate stations and
operate its own offices in Washington, Tokyo, London and at the
American Stock Exchange on Wall Street.
   NBC had a powerful ally in Tele-Communications Inc., the
nation's largest cable system operator, which has interests in
systems with more than 11 million subscribers.
   Tele-Communications agreed to lease a satellite channel for
CNBC. Robert Thompson, a Tele-Communications executive, said his
company also is contributing several million subscribers to the
charter group of CNBC subscribers, but would not be more specific.
   CNBC got another lift when it agreed on a joint venture with
another big cable system operator, Cablevision Systems Corp., that
would pool NBC's business channel with the nine sports, news and
entertainment programming services of Cablevision's Rainbow
Programming unit. NBC runs CNBC in the deal.
   But Marquest Research, a North Carolina-based concern that
surveys major cable operators, said it found only limited support
for CNBC outside the cable systems in which Tele-Communications and
Cablevision had an interest.
   ``The others are saying they want to see what the service looks
like,'' said Marquest executive Paul Rule. ``There is a concern
that it may be a duplication of what is being done by (Turner's)
Headline News or FNN.''
   Some operators are taking both CNBC and FNN.
   David Meister, who heads FNN, said he expects only ``a minor
defection of a few percent'' from the FNN subscriber base of nearly
33 million because of the arrival of CNBC and suggests the two
networks can co-exist. ``The casual viewer is not going to be
satisfied by us or vice versa,'' he said.
   Turner Broadcasting, which runs CNN, Headline News and
Superstation WTBS besides TNT, is less sympathetic. NBC reportedly
considered buying a piece of CNN a few years ago and later
considered starting its own cable news network.
   Turner executives believe NBC intends to compete against them as
a general news cable network and that CNBC is only a way to get in
the door.
   CNBC's Eskridge denies that, but Turner executive Arthur Sando
said his company will be watching. ``We have had competition before
and we are not afraid of competition,'' he said.

   A sale of strike-torn Eastern Airlines
increasingly is seen as the only way to resolve its deadlocked
labor dispute, according to many experts who also cautioned
Thursday that employees will discover they may have lost the fight
no matter who ends up owning the carrier.
   Interested buyers following in the footsteps of Peter V.
Ueberroth are likely to demand at least the same $210 million in
labor concessions included in his aborted takeover plan.
   ``Concessions are just the starting point'' for any further
talks, said Paul Tiffany, a professor of management at the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
   Observers see a sale of the carrier as a face-saving device for
unions that have locked themselves in a seething battle they have
has focused almost entirely on the perceived evils of one man _
Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp.
   ``Of recent labor disputes, I can't think of any that is so
personalized, and that one-dimensional perspective is wrong,''
Tiffany said.
   ``A sale will allow the employees to say they were fighting for
a principle,'' he said. A period of worker euphoria will follow any
sale of the carrier but once that fades, Tiffany predicted,
employees could realize they've lost economically.
   After the Ueberroth deal collapsed, Eastern reiterated a plan to
return to the skies as a scaled-down company roughly half its
pre-strike size. If a buyer emerges who will save even some of the
jobs Eastern would cut, ``it's a big gain'' for the unions, said
bankruptcy attorney Richard Lieb.
   But there is no guarantee a new owner would preserve a
significant number of jobs. Harvard Business School professor
Janice McCormick said the dispute ``is way past the point of
victory for anybody.''
   The Ueberroth deal collapsed due to an impasse over the union
demand that a court-appointed trustee replace Lorenzo in charge of
Eastern until the carrier's reorganization plan was approved _ a
demand experts said could prove to be the unions' biggest mistake.
   ``As the transaction was originally structured, it had so many
escape hatches ... that there was no assurance the airline would
end up back in hands of Lorenzo'' if Ueberroth backed out, said
pilots' attorney Bruce Simon.
   But appointing a trustee sends a more subtle message to those
versed in such legal maneuvers.
   Trustees, while very rarely appointed, typically are named when
there has been ``fraud, dishonesty, incompetence or gross
mismangement of a company'' or less frequently if it is in the
interest of creditors or stockholders, said James J. White, a
management professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
   For example, in January 1988, a bankruptcy judge appointed a
trustee to run Sharon Steel Corp. because Chairman Victor Posner
failed to agree with creditors restaffing the board of directors.
   Posner had to repay Sharon $4.4 million which he had used to pay
legal fees in a tax evasion trial where he pleaded no contest.
   While White said he ``can't understand how the court could reach
the conclusion'' that there is fraud or dishonesty involved in
running Eastern, he noted the appointment of a trustee generally
casts a pall over management.
   If a successful buyer does not emerge, experts said, the unions
could be forced back into negotiations in time.
   ``After a long enough strike, everybody's views change,'' White
said, particularly as strikers face continued expenses and little
to no income.
   ``A fair number of (Eastern) employees are accustomed to a
fairly nice standard of living who are surely going to be in a
bind. Notwithstanding their dislike for Lorenzo, that will push
them'' to a settlement, White said.

<TEXT>
   The dollar finished lower against major foreign
currencies in hectic trading Thursday, buffeted by a hike in
interest rates by a key European bank.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $389.10 a troy ounce for gold, up $2.10 from Wednesday's
late bid.
   Dealers said a move by the Swiss National Bank to raise interest
rates got currency trading off to a chaotic start.
   ``The Swiss franc had been fairly weak against other currencies,
and this gave the signal that (the Swiss) didn't want it to
depreciate much further,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at
the Bank of Boston.
   Dealers sold dollars to buy the Swiss franc, which led the
downturn in the U.S. currency, Morrissey said.
   The gap between U.S. and European interest rates decreases when
rates rise overseas, decreasing the relative attractiveness of
dollar-denominated investments.
   Further rumors that the Bank of Japan might be next in line to
raise rates continued to pressure the dollar, said Stephen
Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   A West German cabinet change also helped boost the European
currencies. The replacement of West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg by Theo Waigel spurred European currencies because
Waigel opposes a 10 percent withholding tax on interest income. The
tax has prompted an outflow of investment money from West Germany
since it was imposed Jan. 1.
   Traders said U.S. activity quieted down later in the session in
anticipation of Friday's release of trade figures for February and
producer prices for March, a key inflation indicator.
   In Tokyo, the dollar slipped to 132.80 Japanese yen from 132.85
yen on Wednesday. In London late Thursday, the dollar was trading
at 132.35. In New York, the dollar finished at 132.05 yen, down
from 133.03 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7010 late Thursday from
Wednesday's late $1.6925. In New York, sterling rose to $1.6982

   Energy futures prices retreated Thursday, as
some traders decided to cash in their holdings to take advantage of
recent price rises.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell 35
cents to close the day at $20.29 a barrel. Other contract months
also fell.
   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for May delivery fell
1.30 cents to 68.81 cents a gallon and heating oil for May delivery
lost 1.06 cents to 52.14 cents a gallon.
   William Byers, an oil analyst for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said the
decline was led by the gasoline contracts which have been rising on
a combination of seasonal demands and worries about the impact of
the Alaskan oil spill.
   ``Gasoline was the catalyst for the decline. There was some
profit-taking in the gasoline group and that depressed crude and
heating oil. It put some psychological pressure on the rest of the
energy group,'' he said.
   But Byers said trading was quiet and most of the price erosion
occurred in the afternoon.
   Peter Beutel, who follows oil prices for Elders Futures Inc.,
said the selling was motivated by technical conditions in the
energy market.
   ``It seems the overriding sentiment in the market is that prices
have gone as far as they can go on this particular runup,'' he said.

<HEAD>Palladium Hits 8-Year High; Platinum Up Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Palladium futures prices soared to an 8-year high Thursday as
new reports on room-temperature nuclear fusion experiments
triggered a rally in platinum futures that drove that metal's price
to its highest level in four months.
   The explosive price gains occurred as scientists at the
University of Washington and in the Soviet Union said they had at
least partially duplicated a University of Utah experiment in which
researchers claim to have used a rod of palladium and coil of
platinum to harness for the first time the nuclear reaction that
fuels the stars.
   On other markets, gold futures rose while silver futures were
mixed; petroleum futures plunged; grains and soybeans were mixed;
and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $24 to $25
higher with the most active contract, for delivery in July, at
$558.30 a troy ounce. Platinum for spot delivery finished at
$555.80, the highest settlement for a spot platinum contract since
Dec. 15.
   Palladium, a whitish metal produced as a byproduct of platinum
and nickel mining, settled $5.50 to $9.85 higher with the active
June contract at $179.65 a troy ounce and the spot April contract
at $184. Spot prices for palladium have not been above $180 since
late 1980.
   Palladium prices have risen steadily since late March, when
chemists B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and his research
partner Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton,
England, stunned the scientific world by announcing their
cold-fusion findings. At least four other groups of researchers
have since confirmed the results, at least partially.
   Market speculators are betting that if the process proves
commercially viable, demand for platinum and palladium will
increase sharply.
   Platinum prices have been slower to respond to the fusion news
than palladium, partly because platinum prices tend to shadow the
gold market, which has been in sluggish period.
   Despite its positive fundamentals, which include a long-term
outlook for extremely tight supplies, the platinum market was
unable to rally until the palladium market gave it a push, said
Richard Levine, vice president of precious-metal and
foreign-exchange trading with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   ``All this reflects is that you're in a good, solid bull market
in the platinum group,'' Levine said.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $2.10 to $2.20
higher with June at $394.20 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent lower
to 0.5 cent higher with May at $5.89 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures fell sharply on the New York Merc as gasoline
traders took profits after four straight gains of strong gains.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 40 cents
lower with May at $20.29 a barrel; heating oil was .91 cent to 1.15
cents lower with May at 52.14 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.30 cent to 1.30 cents lower with May at 68.81 cents a gallon.
   Wheat for May delivery advanced moderately on the Chicago Board
of Trade amid persistent rumors that the Soviet Union had purchased
a large quantity of U.S. wheat for near-term delivery.
   The National Weather Service's prediction for normal
precipitation in most of the Midwest next week weighed on corn and
soybean prices.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 5} cents higher with May at $4.08} a
bushel; corn was 1} cents lower to 1 cent higher with May at $2.68}
a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 5 cents higher with May at $1.84 a
bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to \ cent higher with May at
$7.27 a bushel.
   Cattle futures finished mostly lower while pork futures ended
narrowly mixed in lackluster trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle were .48 cent lower to .15 cent higher with June at
70.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .75 cent lower
with May at 75.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to
.20 cent higher with June at 40.12 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .20 cent lower to .20 cent higher with May at 33.35
cents a pound.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended April 3, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,083.9 billion from $3,078.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$3,959.5 billion from $3,961.9 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $781.1 billion from $787.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of
3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since
early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,072.8 billion, a 2.0
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,939.7 billion, up 3.9 percent, while M1
fell 0.6 percent to an average of $786.4 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $200 million in
the week ended April 5.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $227 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$551 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled a revised
$844 million in the two weeks ended April 5, up from a revised $319
million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $288.0 billion in the two-week period ended
April 5, down from $289.7 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Lorillard Introduces Lemon-Tasting Cigarette in 3 Markets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city proved to be an inhospitable test
market for Premier, R.J. Reynolds' gamble on a high-tech, smokeless
cigarette, but it's one of three cities chosen for test-marketing a
more conventional smoke.
   Lorillard Inc. on Thursday announced that its Spring Lemon
Lights would be sold in Phoenix, Milwaukee, and Hartford, Conn.,
before national introduction.
   Tucson, Phoenix and St. Louis were separate markets for Premier.
   Lorillard competitor R.J. Reynolds ended a five-month test of
Premier on March 1, saying that although consumer acceptance had
been poor, the idea might work in the future. Premier used a carbon
heat source to pull warm air over a flavor capsule containing dried
tobacco.
   Lorillard spokeswoman Sara R. Ridgway said the Premier failure
played no role in test-market selection.
   ``That was a different type of product. This is a standard old
cigarette. The difference is that it has a lemon taste,'' she said.
   Ms. Ridgway said Phoenix was considered a good test market
because of demographics and location. The desert metropolis is far
enough away from other cities to enable planners to analyze the
impact of advertising and response, she said.
   Roland D. Hammer, group brand manager for New York-based
Lorillard, said the new cigarettes would be available in menthol
and non-menthol, both in two sizes.
   He said they would be packaged in yellow, silver and red or
yellow, silver and green color schemes to convey the idea of a
lemon-flavored smoke.
   ``The `hint-of-lemon' taste is a light, refreshing sensation
that can easily be associated with springtime,'' Hammer said.
   The advertising campaign was created by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi,
featuring springtime themes and settings, Hammer said.
   Lorillard, which has manufacturing plants in Greensboro, N.C.,
and Danville, Va., also makes Kent, Triumph, Newport, True, Satin,
Old Gold and Max cigarette varieties.

<HEAD>Hearing Scheduled On Hunt Brothers', Creditors' Bankruptcy Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Creditors led by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
have asked a bankruptcy judge to appoint a trustee to begin selling
assets of two former billionaire Hunt brothers to pay some of the
more than $2 billion in debt built up through failed business and
investment enterprises.
   Nelson Bunker Hunt and W. Herbert Hunt, meanwhile, have filed a
sealed plan offering their own attempt at reorganizing their
holdings to pay off creditors.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson set a Friday afternoon
hearing to discuss the plans, as well as hear the Hunt brothers'
request they be given another 120-day extension on filing a more
detailed reorganization plan. He may unseal the Hunts' plan at that
time, or keep it under seal.
   The Hunts filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last
September after a New York jury awarded Minepaco S.A. of Peru
$134.6 million on the company's claim the Hunts conspired to corner
the silver market in 1979 and 1980.
   Although Chapter 11 provides for reorganization rather than
liquidation, IRS attorney Grover Hartt said, ``Our reason for
asking for a liquidation in the context of a Chapter 11 is we feel
it would be cheaper and that there will be more assets available
for creditors.''
   The IRS, Minepaco and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. filed
their plan Tuesday.
   ``The plan contemplates the orderly liquidation of the
property,'' the plan said. ``Certain entities ... will continue to
be operated until the debtor's interest can be liquidated in a
commercially reasonable manner.''
   Russ Munsch, an attorney for Bunker Hunt, said, ``At this point,
the creditors' plan is simply an outline, and it doesn't address
all the creditors. It is incomplete.''
   In bankruptcy court filings, Bunker and Caroline Hunt say they
have debts of $1.2 billion and property worth $249 million. Herbert
and Nancy Hunt list debts of $887 million and property worth $40
million.
   Besides the Minepaco judgment, the IRS claims Herbert Hunt and
his wife owe $300 million in back taxes while Bunker Hunt and his
wife owe $700 million.
   A third brother, Lamar Hunt, is not involved in the bankruptcy
proceedings, although he also participated in the silver dealings.
   Just last month, Lamar Hunt and other defendants agreed to
settle two lawsuits stemming from the speculation.
   Lamar Hunt and other defendants, which include the giant
investment firm Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., agreed to create a $58 million
settlement pool to compensate the plaintiffs, who included traders
in silver futures.
   Lamar Hunt made a $17 million payment last October to settle his
portion of the Minepaco case. Under terms of that deal, the jury
findings against Lamar Hunt were dismissed.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves S&amp;L Bailout Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: New throughout with subcommittee passing S&amp;L bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's $90 billion plan to bail out
the savings and loan industry cleared its second major
congressional hurdle Thursday, passing a House subcommittee one day
after receiving the unanimous endorsement of the Senate Banking
Committee.
   The 47-member House Banking subcommittee on financial
institutions, chaired by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., passed the
bill by voice vote after four day-long drafting sessions wading
through nearly 200 amendments.
   The chairman of the full Banking panel, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, said he hoped to move the bill through his committee by
April 27 and through the House by the end of May.
   Following a conference between the House and Senate, that could
put the bill on Bush's desk in early June, four months after
announcing his proposal for solving what's described as the worst
financial crisis since the Depression.
   The bill would provide $50 billion over the next three years to
close or merge about 350 failed S&amp;Ls and another $40 billion
necessary to meet government pledges made last year in the rescue
of another 200 institutions.
   The government would borrow much of the money through a
quasi-governmental corporation, keeping $50 billion of the spending
out of the budget defict. With interest, the package is expected to
cost at least $157 billion over the next decade, with more than
half coming from taxpayers.
   Accompanying the money are a long list of what Bush has called
``never again'' reforms.
   The key reform _ requiring S&amp;L owners to back their lending with
more of their own capital _ was watered down somewhat in both the
House and Senate versions, but administration supporters said the
capital standards are a big improvement over existing standards and
survived in much better shape than they expected.
   ``It''s now pretty clear that a bill will pass with enough money
to take care of the problem in the next several years and it will
have fairly tough capital standards,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., who was supporting Bush's proposal. ``It's better than I
ever expected.''
   The administration is still unhappy, however, with House and
Senate provisions that would permit capital-deficient thrifts to
continue growing. The administration sought to force weak
institutions to shrink their operations or find a merger partner.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which under the bill would get expanded responsibility to
insure deposits in S&amp;Ls as well as commercial banks, said the
growth loophole undermines what are otherwise generally sound
changes in the capital standard.
   ``We certainly see it as something that erodes the basic theme
of the administration's bill,'' he said. ``It's really building the
skyscraper on quicksand.''
   The bills passed by the banking panels also restructure the
regulatory bureaucracy. The chief S&amp;L agency, the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, will be split up. The regional banks which make
low-cost loans to S&amp;Ls will be placed under a new independent
agency. The FDIC will get control of the S&amp;L deposit insurance fund
and what is left of the agency will become an arm of the Treasury
Department.
   In late action, the House subcommittee voted to give the Justice
Department $75 million a year pursuing criminals in the savings and
loan industry, up from $50 million in the president's proposal. The
bill retain's Bush's proposed penalty of $1 million a day for
serious violations of regulatory standards, but makes it more
difficult for regulators to impose the top penalty.
   Earlier Thursday, the House subcommittee amended the bill by
removing barriers to the melding of the thrift industry with
commercial banking. It voted to permit bank holding companies to
immediately begin acquiring both insolvent and healthy S&amp;Ls.
   In deference to small banks and thrifts, which fear that the
nation's largest commercial banking companies will be able to amass
too much market power at their expense, Bush had proposed allowing
banks to buy only ailing S&amp;Ls for the next two years and healthy
ones as well after that.
   Reps. Stan Parris, R-Va., and Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said
their measure was designed to attract new investors to the
undercapitalized savings and loan industry.
   In another move breaking down the barriers between S&amp;Ls and
commercial banks, the subcommittee decided to make banks and credit
unions that concentrate at least 30 percent of their business in
housing lending eligible for loans from the regional Federal Home
Loan Banks.
   The also approved, by voice vote, an amendment forcing Federal
Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall to be reconfirmed by
the Senate after his agency is wrapped into the Treasury Department
under the administration's restructuring plan.
   The administration, in deference to Wall's former boss, Utah
Sen. Jake Garn, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking
Committee, had sought to guarantee Wall the job through mid-1991.
But Democrats, unhappy with Wall's decision last year to commit the
government to spending at least $38 billion to bail out more than
200 S&amp;Ls, want him removed.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Concurrent Sentence For Ex-Broker In Business Week Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Merrill Lynch stockbroker
convicted in an insider trading scandal was sentenced Thursday to
six months in prison, to be served concurrently with an identical
sentence on a separate charge in New York.
   U.S. District Judge Ellen Burns said she took into account
William Dillon's continuing cooperation with investigators in
deciding not to add to the sentence imposed Tuesday by a federal
judge in New York.
   Dillon, 34, of Old Lyme, pleaded guilty last year in New Haven
and New York to single counts of wire fraud stemming from a scheme
in which he illicitly obtained advance copies of Business Week
magazine.
   While working as a broker at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s New London
office, Dillon profited by trading stocks that received favorable
mention in the magazine's ``Inside Wall Street'' column. He sold
the stocks after the magazine was released to the public and their
prices rose.
   A federal judge in New York sentenced Dillon to two years in
prison but suspended all but six months. The judge also placed
Dillon on three years' probation, required him to perform 200 hours
of community service and ordered him to make full restitution of an
amount to be determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The government contends Dillon made $118,000 in profits through
his illegal scheme between May 1986 and July 1988.
   Burns said there was no need for her to order restitution or
community service because the New York sentence took care of that.
Prosecutors had also recommended a concurrent sentence.
   Dillon has been working since January as a carpenter helping to
renovate homes for the retarded, his attorney, Henry Putzel, told
the court.
   He will not have to surrender until June 5.
   Dillon paid $10 to $30 for advance copies of Business Week to
various employees of R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., which prints the
weekly publication at two plants. Several Donnelley employees were
fired in the wake of the scandal.
   Dillon's mother, Elizabeth Baird, maintained an account through
which some trades were made based on the information from Business
Week, the government said. She was not charged, but has been
required to turn over any profits she realized.
   Dillon also has admitted tipping off others to the information
he obtained.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Jongbloed said an investigation is
continuing, but declined any other comment.

<TEXT>
   Freeport McMoRan Inc. offered up to $600
million Thursday for 15 million shares of its common stock _ or
about 21.8 percent of the shares outstanding.
   The natural resources company said it will buy the shares in
what is known as a Dutch auction, setting a single price between
$35 and $40 per share, based on the number and prices of shares
offered by stockholders.
   ``We felt that to spend ... between $525 million and $600
million for our own stock was an excellent investment,'' said Craig
Saporito, vice president and director of investor relations for
Freeport McMoRan.
   Companies often repurchase shares of stock to make the price
rise, discouraging unsolicited takeover offers. Freeport McMoRan
stock, $34.37{ Wednesday, closed at $37 Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Stockholders who offered shares at or below the price set by
Freeport McMoRan will get that price in cash, said the company,
which owns majority interests of divisions which drill for oil, gas
and sulphur, mine gold, copper, diamonds and uranium, and work with
geothermal energy.
   ``Every time you put money in the ground, even though we've been
extremely successful of late, there's a risk,'' said Saporito. ``We
looked at a number of things and felt that that kind of investment
in our stock ... would benefit not only the company but the
shareholders who elected to tender and the shareholders who elected
to continue with us.''
   Even that was probably less than its worth, especially
considering Tuesday's announcements of major sulphur and copper
finds, said Terry H. Smith, vice president of the New Orleans-based
brokerage firm of Howard, Weill Inc.
   Tuesday, Freeport McMoRan announced that Freeport Egyptian
Sulphur Co. had found a 20 million ton sulphur deposit on a
concession in Egypt's North Sinai Desert. It also announced that
Freeport-McMoRan Copper Co. Inc. had increased the reserve estimate
for a mine in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, from 93 million metric tons to
118 million metric tons of ore yielding copper, gold and silver.
   ``Our appraised value for Freeport McMoRan prior to the
announced major discoveries of silver and copper was approximately
$40 per share. I am ... revising those numbers, and believe that
$40 may be low by as much as 50 percent,'' said Smith.

   Gannett Co. Inc. said Thursday its first-quarter earnings edged
up 1.3 percent, the New York Times Co. said its first-quarter
profit declined and Affiliated Publications Inc. reported a smaller
first-quarter loss.
   Gannett, which is based in Arlington, Va., reported record
first-quarter earnings of $74.9 million, or 47 cents per share,
compared to $74 million, or 46 cents per share, during the same
period the previous year.
   The latest results reflected a pretax gain of $9 million on the
sale of two newspapers. The 1988 results included a $45 million
gain from the sale of Gannett's interest in Cowles Media.
   Operating revenues grew 8 percent to $817.9 million in the first
quarter, compared to $757.9 last year.
   Operating income rose 24 percent to $145.0 million from $117.0
million a year earlier.
   ``Operating income posted its strongest advance since the first
quarter of 1984, reflecting a stronger retail advertising
environment and favorable supply conditions for newsprint,'' John
J. Curley, Gannett chairman, president and chief executive officer,
said in a letter to stockholders.
   He said the gain in operating income resulted from stronger
local advertising demand and effective expense controls. Newspaper
advertising increased 7 percent during the quarter, and circulation
revenues increased 4 percent. Broadcasting revenues rose 10
percent, and outdoor revenues increased 27 percent.
   Gannett publishes 85 daily newspapers, including USA Today, 35
non-daily newspapers and USA Weekend, a newspaper magazine. The
company also operates 10 television stations, 16 radio stations,
Gannett News Services and the largest outdoor advertising company
in North America.
   Boston-based Affiliated said it lost $9.9 million in the first
quarter compared with a loss of $14.4 million in the same period a
year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 2.9 percent to $130.4 million, up
from $126.7 million a year earlier.
   The latest results include charges of $18.9 million related to
Affiliated's equity investment in McCaw Cellular Communications
Inc. compared with charges of $25.3 million a year earlier.
   Affiliated owns The Boston Globe, which ``continues to
experience softness in advertising linage, particularly in
classified, which has negatively affected advertising revenues,''
said Affiliated Chairman William O. Taylor.
   Affiliated also owns Billboard Publications Inc., and Taylor
said he is pleased with the results from the specialty publishing
business.
   The New York Times Co. said its first-quarter profit dropped to
$33.5 million, or 42 cents a share, from $45.5 million, or 56 cents
a share, in the first quarter of 1988.
   Revenue for the 1989 period totaled $423.1 million, up from
$416.9 million a year earlier.
   ``As we had anticipated, first-quarter earnings were down
significantly,'' said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief
executive. ``The business climate in New York remains uncertain;
However, we continue to believe that 1989 will be a satisfactory
year.''
   Operating profit dropped 15 percent in the company's newspaper
group, due principally to lower ad volume at the Times, the company
said. The group also inlcudes 35 regional newspapers and a
one-third interest in the International Herald Tribune.
   Operating profit also was off sharply at the company's magazine
group, to $700,000 from $7.3 million a year earlier, the company
said.

<HEAD>Perot, EDS Both Claim Victory In Lawsuit Ruling</HEAD>

   Billionaire H. Ross Perot may not begin any
profit-making ventures with his new company before Dec. 1, but may
continue to hire employees from his old, GM-purchased firm for the
next 2{ years, a Virginia judge ruled Thursday.
   The order by Fairfax County Circuit Judge William Plummer makes
permanent an earlier order in the fight between Electronic Data
Systems Inc. and Perot Systems Corp. over Perot's activities since
he left the company in a dispute with General Motors Corp.
   Perot and Perot Systems of Dallas ``shall refrain, prior to
December 1, 1989, from soliciting, negotiating for, entering into
or performing any contract or other business relationship ... that
contemplates or calls for any profitable return to the defendants
at any point in time, and involves the business of providing data
processing or other services to customers of a nature provided by
EDS as of December 1, 1986,'' Plummer ordered.
   Meanwhile, Perot may continue to hire EDS employees until Dec.
1, 1991. EDS says Perot has hired 150 to 200 of its employees,
eight of them executives.
   Both sides claimed victory in the decision, which essentially
upholds the sales agreement between GM and Perot.
   ``I wanted an injunction because GM never lives up to its
contracts. I wanted it solved in court,'' Perot said in Dallas.
   Perot previously has said that he is not engaged in any
profit-making business through Perot Systems.
   EDS ``got slam-dunked over and over again and we consider it to
be a fantastic victory,'' said Perot attorney Mike Weinstein. ``For
us it's business as usual.''
   EDS said the decision was a ``clear and unmistakable victory.''
President Les Alberthal said, ``Judge Plummer has made it clear
that Perot has an obligation to live up to the terms of the
agreement he signed when he left EDS. And he can't continue to raid
EDS for talent indefinitely. This is a significant victory for
EDS.''
   EDS said it would pursue further, unspecified legal action
against former EDS employees who left the Dallas company to work
for Perot Systems.
   Perot called the threats ``harassment''
   On Dec. 1, 1986, GM paid $700 million to buy Perot's stock in
both EDS and the automaker. Under terms of the buyout, which
followed public feuds between Perot and GM Chairman Roger Smith,
Perot could not compete against EDS until Dec. 1, 1989.
   EDS sued Perot last fall, alleging that he violated his
agreement with GM by forming Perot Systems to compete with EDS and
by hiring EDS employees.
   Under the ruling, employees hired by EDS after the GM purchase
are bound by a non-compete clause should they go work for Perot.
However, those hired before the GM purchase would not be bound by
the clause, should they work for Perot, until after Dec. 1, 1991.

<HEAD>Fired Executive Sues Merrill Lynch Over Alleged Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Chicago Board of Trade floor broker
alleges in a lawsuit that he was fired by a division of Merrill
Lynch for blowing the whistle on what he said was a scheme that
cost the exchange millions of dollars.
   But a Merrill Lynch spokesman in New York said Thursday the
allegations of the scheme and the improper firing are ``totally
without foundation.''
   James E. Zechman, a former $500,000-a-year vice president for
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc., said he was fired after
he told his bosses the company was disguising outside customer
trades as house trades to avoid higher exchange fees.
   Merrill Lynch ``knowingly created and perpetuated a scheme ...
and improperly deprived the CBOT of millions of dollars in
revenues,'' Zechman charged in the suit.
   ``Zechman's allegation of wrongdoing by Merrill Lynch is totally
without foundation,'' Fred Yager, a company spokesman, said in a
statement. ``Zechman's termination in August 1988 was based solely
on his own personal misconduct. At no time did he bring any
allegations of wrondoing to Merrill Lynch's attention.''
   According to the suit, the Board of Trade charges 4 cents for
each trade that member firms, such as Merrill Lynch, make for their
own accounts. It charges a $1 fee for each transaction member firms
conduct for non-member firms and individual investors.
   The non-member pays the $1 fee to Merrill Lynch, which pays the
exchange.
   Zechman's suit charges that Merrill Lynch funneled non-member
trades through its house account, thus paying only 4 cents to the
exchange. However, the suit charges, Merrill Lynch billed customers
the $1 but called it a ``risk profile'' fee to hide the scheme from
the exchange.
   Zechman, of suburban Highland Park, said he became aware of the
alleged scheme about a week before he was fired, demanded the
practice be stopped and insisted it be reported to Board of Trade
officials.
   Zechman said Merrill Lynch refused his requests and fired him on
what he said were trumped-up charges.
   Zechman seeks $10 million in punitive damages and $10 million in
actual damages from the defendants.

<HEAD>Carson Pirie Board Rejects Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. said Wednesday that its
board of directors rejected a $282 million offer from P.A. Bergner
&amp; Co. to merge the two Midwest department store chains.
   P.A. Bergner, a Swiss-owned chain with headquarters in
Milwaukee, sought to acquire Carson Pirie of Chicago for at least
$20 a share in cash or an unspecified combination of cash, stock
and notes.
   ``Carson's board of directors has unanimously determined that it
is not in the best interest of ... shareholders, employees,
customers, suppliers and other constituencies,'' Peter S. Willmott,
chairman, president and chief executive of the company, said in a
letter to P.A. Bergner.
   ``During the last two years, Carson Pirie ... has returned the
company to retailing as its core business and provided Carson's
shareholders with a cash payment of more than $30 a share,'' he
wrote. ``The best interests of Carson's shareholders will be served
by the company pursuing an independent course.''
   Alan R. Anderson, chairman and chief executive of P.A. Bergner,
said he was disappointed with the decision.
   ``Our offer, after all, represents a 52 percent premium over the
price at which Carson's stock has traded during 1989'' before the
offer was made.
   Carson Pirie's stock closed unchanged at $21.37{ a share
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``We have stated our willingness to meet with Mr. Willmott and
his financial and legal advisors to negotiate a definite
acquisition agreement at a fair price that would benefit Carson
Pirie Scott's shareholders, employees and customers,'' Anderson
said.
   ``We can only wonder what alternatives the board can propose to
shareholders to maximize the worth of their investment in a way
that is comparable to the values contained in our proposed merger
proposal,'' Anderson said.
   Carson Pirie lost $38.8 million in the fiscal year ended Jan.
31., much of it from its catalog operations. It owns 33 department
stores in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana and Minnesota, as well as 388
County Seat specialty stores in Midwest and Sunbelt states and 23
Arcadia stores in Chicago.
   P.A. Bergner operates 31 department stores in Illinois and
Wisconsin.
