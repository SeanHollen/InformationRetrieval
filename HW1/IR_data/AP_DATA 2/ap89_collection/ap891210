   The director of the Kansas Bureau of
Investigation resigned after a racist joke he told two reporters
sparked heavy criticism.
   Dave Johnson announced his resignation Saturday, the same day
The Kansas City Times printed a column about the joke.
   Johnson told the joke while talking to the reporters about a
triple murder for which two teen-agers _ a black man and a white
woman _ have been arrested. Within hours of the column's
publication, 22 legislators had signed letters to Attorney General
Robert Stephan condemning Johnson's conduct. The chairwoman of the
state Republican Party, state Rep. Rochelle Chronister, said she
was preparing a letter to Stephan calling for Johnson's resignation
when he resigned.
   ``I'm pleased that the man saw fit to resign,'' said Rep.
Sherman Jones, one of the state's four black legislators, who
drafted one letter.
   Stephan said he accepted Johnson's resignation with regret and
appointed Assistant Director James G. Malson acting director.
   According to the column, Johnson told a joke that used the word
``nigger.''
   The column was written by Ted Frederickson, an associate
professor of journalism at the University of Kansas who worked for
the Times this fall. His tenure with the paper ended Friday.
   In his letter of resignation to Stephan, Johnson acknowledged
making the joke but said Frederickson took it out of context.
   ``I am sure you are aware that my performance has not indicated
that I am a racist,'' Johnson wrote. ``It is not my intent to cause
any criticism of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, office of the
attorney general or law enforcement in general.''
   Frederickson said Johnson told the joke last week when
questioned by him and another reporter about the murder of three
retired neighbors in Topeka. The other reporter was Associated
Press Correspondent Lew Ferguson.
   ``I concluded that the public he serves and the attorney general
who supervises him need to know about the views Johnson expresses
with his racist jokes,'' Frederickson wrote.
   Ferguson said he was discussing the Topeka slayings with
Frederickson at the door of the Times' Statehouse office when
Johnson came by and joined them. After the discussion turned to the
question of how a black man from the inner city and a white woman
from suburban Topeka could have hooked up to commit the slayings,
Johnson told the joke, Ferguson said.
   Police have charged Tyrone Baker, 19, and his girlfriend, Lisa
Ann Pfannenstiel, 18, in the slayings. Police said the pair killed
one woman in her home while commiting a burglarly that netted $70,
then killed two elderly neighbors who dropped by to check on the
woman.
   Baker and Pfannenstiel, both high school dropouts, also face a
variety of kidnapping, burglary and robbery charges. They have not
entered pleas.
   Johnson, 59, became KBI director in July 1987. He had worked as
an investigator for the state Insurance Department after retiring
as a KBI agent in 1984.

   Congress wastes millions of dollars by loading
down the Defense Department budget with special tidbits for
constituents and by imposing excessive restraints on spending
programs, a Pentagon draft report says.
   ``The principles underlying Congress' control over acquisitions
and budgets are not in dispute. However, the principles have been
implemented in a way that has produced unintended consequences,''
the Pentagon, which is often at odds with Congress, said in a
43-page white paper.
   A copy of the Oct. 27 draft report, which was prepared by the
office of the secretary of defense, was to be released Sunday by
the Project on Military Procurement. A copy was obtained early by
The Associated Press.
   In its study, the Pentagon speaks in bitter, sometimes sarcastic
terms, about the ``pervasive nature of congressional intervention.''
   Specifically, the Pentagon said Congress approves money for
thousands of budget items to specific recipients.
   These items, known as earmarks, often mean goodies for a
constituent and result in cuts somewhere in DoD's budget request.
   ``These earmarks frequently have little direct relation to
genuine defense needs,'' the report said. ``In other cases,
earmarks represent mandates to spend funds on what are clearly
low-priority items.''
   In fiscal 1990, Congress approved a $305 billion defense budget.
   The Pentagon study also cited the increase in the number of
reports required by Congress _ 36 in 1970 at the height of the
Vietnam War, 719 in 1988 _ and the requirements imposed on
employment levels and technology.
   Limits on specific programs proved costly, according to the
report. In a review of 42 program requirements in the 1989 budget
cycle, the requirements increased costs in 75 percent of the cases,
at a cost of more than $800 million over the life of the programs.
   The Pentagon cited no examples of program requirements, but they
might include such things as requiring a research project to meet
certain goals before more money could be allocated.
   The Pentagon also said congressional instructions on competition
for defense contracts have led to increases in costs and reductions
in management options.
   ``The current congressional defense process is characterized by
a multiplicity of actors, frequent decisions, lack of finality,
disintegration and lack of accountability,'' the draft report said.
   ``The focus is on details at the expense of broad policy,
functions at the expense of missions and accounting inputs at the
expense of results,'' the report added.
   Congressional sources, who spoke on condition they not be
identified, called some of the complaints ``ridiculous,'' and noted
that in 1984 Congress tried to cut the number of reports but the
Pentagon balked.
   Some Pentagon offices were upset when told they no longer needed
to report to Congress, the sources said.
   In addition, the budget line items often reflect a difference in
policy between Congress and the Pentagon, while congressional
mandates on contracts are meant to encourage greater competition,
the sources said.
   The report recommends two-year budgets and multiyear
procurements as a solution to the problems between Congress and the
department.

   A man arrested in Maine claimed he
belonged to a team sent to cripple a nuclear plant in Canada,
prompting an increase in security at five Canadian plants,
authorities said Saturday. Officials later said the claim was a
hoax.
   Security was increased at the Point Lepreau generating station
just west of St. John, New Brunswick, and 30 miles north of the
Maine border; Ontario's three nuclear plants and Quebec's sole
nuclear generator, Canadian Press said.
   The man, who identified himself as Manuel Hernandez, 42, of
Guadalajara, Mexico, was arrested Thursday while driving a stolen
car on the Maine Turnpike in Saco in southern Maine, state police
spokesman Stephen McCausland said.
   ``Hernandez claimed a group from Central America was heading
north to attack nuclear power plants,'' Cpl. Mike Seguin of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Fredericton, New Brunswick, said
Saturday in a statement.
   A mounted police inspector from New Brunswick traveled to
Portland to look into the claim, according to Seguin.
   ``Basically, it's been established as a hoax,'' mounted police
Inspector Art Crosby said in Ottawa.
   Seguin said security at Point Lepreau was being reduced.
   Extra security forces were stationed at the plant and a police
tactical team was put on standby earlier Saturday after mounted
police notified Point Lepreau managers of the arrest, said plant
manager John Sommerville.
   Sommerville said the country's Atomic Energy Control Board was
also alerted.
   He said that as far as he knew, no mention was made of New
Brunswick or Point Lepreau, the only nuclear plant in the Maritime
Provinces.
   McCausland said investigators have been unable to confirm the
man's name. ``He had no identification, he was not armed and he
offered no resistance,'' he said.
   In addition to the mounted police, state police notified U.S.
immigration officials and the FBI of the arrest, McCausland said.
   Police arrested the man after spotting a car weaving on the
turnpike. A check of the license plate showed that the car had been
stolen in Silver Spring, Md., on Nov. 29, McCausland said.
   ``We have charged him with theft of an automobile and operating
without a license and that's all he's being held on,'' McCausland
said. He would not disclose where the suspect was being held but
said he probably would be arraigned early in the week in a District
Court in York County.
   The arrest came four days before five Colombian men were to
appear in a New Brunswick court on charges of attempting to break
two South American cocaine smugglers out of a jail in the province.
   The five men were arrested after a carload of weapons was seized
in September in Edmundston, New Brunswick, just across the border
from Madawaska, Maine.

   Rutgers University President Edward
J. Bloustein died Saturday of an apparent heart attack in the
Bahamas, a university spokeswoman said. He was 64.
   Bloustein, a philospher and lawyer, was attending a business
meeting in Nassau when he collapsed Saturday afternoon, spokeswoman
Ruth Scott said.
   He became the 17th president of Rutgers in 1971 and was among
the dozen longest-serving presidents of public colleges and
universities in the country. More than 47,000 students attend the
25 colleges and schools of Rutgers, the eighth oldest institution
in the country.
   ``Ed Bloustein was an individual committed to excellence in
education and to the cause of academic freedom,'' Gov. Thomas Kean
said in a statement.
   In accepting the presidency, Bloustein said he took on the
challenge of an urban university because ``that's where the major
problems of higher education are and I want to be there.''
   He frequently testified before congressional committees on the
need to provide added research funds to the nation's universities,
and he recently called for requiring community service for all
college students in the United States.
   In 1984, he was chairman of the National Association of State
Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, which represents 140
institutions in the United States.
   Before coming to Rutgers, Bloustein was president of Bennington
College in Vermont from 1965 to 1971, and professor of law at New
York University from 1961 to 1965.
   Bloustein was born in New York City. He was a member of Phi Beta
Kappa at New York University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts
degree in 1948. He went to Oxford University as a Fulbright scholar
and received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree from Wadham College in
1950. He also received doctoral degrees in law and philosophy from
Cornell University.
   Bloustein is survived by two daughters, Elise and Lori. His
wife, Ruth, died last year.

   Police arrested 125 anti-abortion protesters in a New Jersey
town Saturday after the group blocked an abortion clinic in
violation of a court order, authorities said.
   In Massachusetts, police arrested about 75 anti-abortion
protestors who tried to block the entrances to three abortion
clinics in a Boston suburb, including one a few blocks from the
home of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   Elsewhere, abortion opponents and supporters faced off in
Southern California, pro-choice demonstrators marched on the
Kentucky Capitol and anti-abortion pickets moved away from an
abortion clinic in Texas when several Ku Klux Klansmen came to join
their ranks.
   In Englewood, N.J., protesters blocked the entrances to the
Metropolitan Medical Associates building in the New York City
suburb at about 7:30 a.m.
   Between 400 and 500 people milled outside the clinic, making it
difficult to distinguish between anti-abortion protesters and
pro-choice demonstrators, said police Sgt. Arthur O'Keefe.
   ``There were pushing and shoving matches breaking out all over
... as well as people who had chained themselves to the front
door,'' O'Keefe said. ``There were some blows struck.''
   Several officers received minor injuries, he said.
   The sergeant said 125 anti-abortion protesters were arrested. He
said they face disorderly person charges for obstructing a public
passage and contempt charges for violating the court order.
   Susan Martinelli, the clinic's medical director, said staff and
patients were able to get into the clinic around 1:30 p.m. Most
patients stayed through the protest and kept their appointments,
she said.
   Ms. Martinelli said the clinic had a court order enjoining
protesters from demonstrating on the same side of the street as the
building. Saturday's protest was the first to violate the order,
she said.
   In the Boston suburb of Brookline, about 500 demonstrators on
both sides of the issue gathered at three clinics, with abortion
rights supporters linking arms to try to prevent abortion opponents
from blocking entrances.
   About 75 anti-abortion protesters were arrested on charges of
disorderly conduct and trespassing, Patrolman Ronald Paterson said.
At least one person also was arrested after punching a police
officer, he said.
   Those arrested were expected to be arraigned Monday in Brookline
District Court, Paterson said.
   In Texas, about 20 Klansmen in a protest outside a clinic in the
Fort Worth suburb of White Settlement. Bill Walton, grand dragon of
the state's KKK, criticized two dozen other anti-abortion pickets
who moved across the street when the Klansmen arrived.
   ``They're like cowards; they ran like rats off a sinking ship,''
Walton said.
   Rick Horton, leader of the protesters from the Tarrant County
Pro-Life Action Network, said his group did not want to be
associated with the Klan. Horton said Walton contacted him earlier
and said he was against the ``the murder of white babies.''
   ``Sure, we're pro-white, but I also told him we're against the
murder of all babies,'' Walton said. ``If some Negro wanted to come
out there and protest with us, he could have.''
   About 550 people tracked through snow and ice to a rally for
women's rights at the Kentucky Capitol in Frankfort. State Reps.
Ernesto Scorsone and Susan Stokes urged participants to write their
state legislators to lobby against any attempt to restrict abortion
in the state.
   In Fullerton, Calif., about 200 people from the anti-abortion
group Operation Rescue and an equal number of pro-choice activists
demonstrated outside an abortion clinic for four hours, Sgt. Steve
Matson said. The clinic was closed Saturday and there were no
arrests, he said.

   State Sen. Craig Washington defeated a city
councilman Saturday in a runoff election to choose a successor to
Rep. Mickey Leland, who died in a plane crash in Africa four months
ago.
   With 100 percent of the vote counted, Washington received 24,120
votes, or 56.6 percent, to 18,473, or 43.4 percent, for Anthony
Hall.
   ``I claim this victory not for myself, but first for our brother
who died on the side of a hill in Ethiopia,'' Washington said at
his victory celebration at a restaurant Saturday night.
   The winner carred a large brass torch he said represented the
passing of Leland's torch to him.
   Washington, who like Hall was a Leland ally, will serve the
remainder of the late congressman's two-year term.
   ``I may not be a champion on the issue of hunger, but I will be
a drum major,'' Washington said, referring to Leland's passion for
helping to feed the starving of the world.
   Washington and Hall topped a field of 11 candidates Nov. 7 to
qualify for the non-partisan runoff for Leland's seat.
   In addition to losing to Washington, Hall lost his council seat
because he sought another elected post.
   ``I'm not at all dejected. I am ... disappointed but not at all
dejected,'' Hall told supporters as his wife, Carolyn, cried at his
side.
   ``We just fell a little bit short. But have faith because things
are going to be better in the 18th District because of the issues
you helped us raise,'' Hall said, congratulating Washington ``for a
good and fine victory.''
   Both men are Democrats in a district that has been described as
among the most staunchly Democratic in the nation.
   Although Hall was favored in the November balloting, Washington
captured 41 percent of the vote to 34 percent for Hall.
   A poll last week showed the race nearly deadlocked, with Hall
ahead 41 percent to 38 percent with 21 percent of the voters
undecided. The poll, conducted for KPRC television in Houston, had
a 5-point margin of error.
   Washington, 48, is an attorney and former law school instructor.
He has served in the Texas Senate since 1983 after a 10-year stint
in the state House.
   Hall, 45, also an attorney, gave up his City Council seat to run
for the Leland vacancy. Both men are black.
   Washington and Hall agreed on many issues, with both favoring
increased money to battle drug trafficking and abuse, and for
health care to the poor and elderly and military cutbacks in
Central America.
   The race came down to a question of style, with the flamboyant
Washington contrasting with the more low-key and businesslike Hall.
   Hall lost a bitter battle to Leland in the congressional race in
1978 when they sought to succeed the retiring Barbara Jordan.
   In this race, Washington won the backing of Leland's widow,
Alison, while Hall carried the endorsement of Houston Mayor Kathy
Whitmire.
   In the early 1970s, Leland, Hall and Washington represented
Houston districts in the Texas House and worked together for civil
rights, fair housing, health care and food for the poor and other
social concerns.
   Leland and 15 others were killed Aug. 7 in a plane crash in
Ethiopia while on a hunger relief mission to a refugee camp.

   A man witnessing a subway robbery fatally
stabbed one of the assailants Saturday and then fled the scene, and
police appealed for him to come forward.
   Police and witnesses said two men were attempting to rob Jean
Claude Vincent, 44, when the man intervened and ordered them to
stop. When they resisted, he announced, ``We're not going to have
any more of this,'' and plunged a knife into the chest of one of
the men.
   The stabbed robber was pronounced dead on arrival at Harlem
Hospital, said Officer Janice Swinney, a police spokeswoman. Police
later identified him as John Jamal and said he had been in his 30s.
   Transit Police spokesman Al O'Leary said detectives recognized
Jamal as a suspect in a November robbery. He had admitted to four
other subway holdups following his arrest in the November case,
O'Leary said.
   The attack on Vincent occurred before 5 a.m. The two men beat
Vincent, punched him in the head and face and started going through
his pockets before the passenger intervened.
   After the stabbing, the second robber dragged his wounded friend
into another car on the subway train, but left him there bleeding
and fled when the train pulled into a station, O'Leary said.
   The passenger who stabbed the man himself fled before police
arrived, O'Leary said. He said police wanted the man to come
forward for the investigation. The knife used in the stabbing was
recovered, police said.
   ``If a felony was being committed and he came to his assistance,
this may very well be justified,'' said Deputy Inspector James
Power.

   Visiting U.S. National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft on Saturday told Chinese officials that Washington wants
to end differences over the Chinese crackdown on dissent and move
ahead with good relations.
   China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, met Sunday with Scowcroft
and agreed the two nations must improve relations ``for world peace
and stability.''
   Deng said although Scowcroft came to brief the Chinese on the
U.S.-Soviet summit in Malta, the importance of the visit ``is that
in spite of the disputes and the differences between us, after all,
Sino-U.S. relations have to be improved.''
   Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
arrived in Beijing earlier in the day as the first high-level Bush
administration officials to visit since the Chinese put down
pro-democracy protests in June.
   ``We believe it is important that we not exhaust ourselves in
placing blame for problems that exist,'' Scowcroft said at a dinner
held Saturday by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
   Scowcroft said he had come ``to bring new impetus and vigor into
our bilateral relationship and seek new areas of agreement .... We
come to reduce the negative influence of irritants in the
relationship.''
   Deng, 85, retired from his last party post in November, but he
retains great influence. He also has cut down his public
apppearances, and his meeting with the Americans was a clear sign
that China hopes to end the feuding.
   The Chinese, who have blamed Washington for current friction,
showed their desire to improve ties by arranging meetings with
China's top leaders on Sunday.
   Scowcroft and Eagleburger also met Sunday with Premier Li Peng
and Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin. The U.S.
delegation was to leave Sunday afternoon for Japan before returning
to Washington on Monday.
   Foreign Minister Qian, in his banquet toast, said the special
envoys' visit shows the importance President Bush attaches to
U.S.-Chinese relations, ``for which we would like to express our
appreciation.''
   ``Important as our differences are,'' Qian said, ``they cannot
obliterate the major common interests between us.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement that while Bush ``deplores the tragedy of Tiananmen
Square last June, China nevertheless remains part of the world
around us. The president views China as an important country in
world affairs.''
   Relations between Beijing and Washington hit a low after Chinese
soldiers swept into the square to oust pro-democracy protesters and
went on to crush their movement. The United States criticized the
violence and repression, and Beijing accused Washington of
interfering in China's internal affairs.
   The Chinese government says 300 people, mostly soldiers, died
during the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing on June 3-4. Witnesses and Western sources say hundreds or
even thousands died, most of the victims unarmed civilians.
   In the past three weeks, the Foreign Ministry has lodged three
official protests with the United States over congressional actions
to expand economic sanctions against China and to allow Chinese
students to extend their stays in the United States.
   But Chinese leaders, in recent meetings with former President
Richard Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, also
have expressed hope that relations could be improved.
   There was speculation in Beijing that the two sides would
discuss how to resolve the situation of astrophysicist Fang Lizhi,
the pro-democracy dissident who has been hiding in the U.S. Embassy
with his wife, Li Shuxian, since the crackdown. The Chinese have
branded the couple as counterrevolutionaries and issued warrants
for their arrest.
   An embassy official declined comment on whether the Americans
discussed Fang in their talks with Qian on Saturday.

   President Gustav Husak, the
nation's last old-guard Communist leader, on Sunday swore in the
first federal government not dominated by Communists in 41 years,
and then he resigned.
   The coalition government, a triumphant victory for the nation's
young but potent pro-democracy movement, includes two men who were
persecuted as dissidents until just several weeks ago. The ceremony
culminated a peaceful revolution led by the nation's top dissident,
playwright Vaclav Havel.
   Havel was not among the opposition members who went to Prague's
historic Castle to be sworn in by Husak, 76, who led the crackdown
on the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reform movement after it was crushed
by a Warsaw Pact invasion.
   Premier Marian Calfa said in a televised news conference shortly
afterward that Husak had resigned, as he had promised to do after
the new government was named. The opposition hopes Havel will be
elected president soon.
   Husak's last official act was to swear in, on International
Human Rights Day, some of the men sent to jail or stripped of all
but the most menial jobs in the years he ruled as Communist Party
chief from 1969 to 1987.
   They included Jiri Dienstbier, a dissident imprisoned with Havel
from 1979 to 1982, who became foreign minister, and Jan
Carnogursky, a Slovak lawyer and Roman Catholic activist, who
became a deputy premier in charge of the secret police and other
state organs.
   Carnogursky was in jail just two weeks ago, when he was among
the first prisoners released under an amnesty as the Communists
scrambled to make concessions to the mass pro-democracy movement on
the streets.
   The new 21-member government contains 10 Communists, two of whom
enjoy opposition support, seven non-party members and two members
each from the small Socialist and People's parties, former docile
Communist allies, who in the past weeks have joined the opposition
in breaking the Communist monopoly on power.
   Reform-minded, Communist economist Valtr Komarek joins
Carnogursky as a first deputy premier, meaning opposition-backed
men are the most powerful after Calfa, the relatively weak
Communist premier named Thursday.
   Vladimir Dlouhy, another opposition-backed, Communist economist,
becomes head of the powerful State Planning Commission, and fellow
economist Vaclav Klaus, a non-party man, becomes minister of
finance.
   The Communists retained control of the Defense Ministry, where
Gen. Miroslav Vacek kept the post he won in a government reshuffle
Dec. 3.
   Other members included Petr Miller, the labor and social affairs
minister, who was proposed by the opposition; Frantisek Podlena, a
Communist Party member who becomes transportation and
communications minister; and Kvetoslava Korinkova, the minister of
people's control, or treasury, who is unaffiliated.
   The new government is expected to lay the legal framework for
the nation to become a constitutional democracy, with free
elections to be held next year.
   The swearing-in Sunday marked the completion of a peaceful,
anti-Communist revolt that also swept through Poland, Hungary and
East Germany after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made it
clear he would not send troops to prop up unpopular, hard-line
Communist governments in the East bloc.
   Czechoslovakia's pro-democracy movement was headed by an
opposition movement that exactly a year ago attracted only 3,000
people to a demonstration for International Human Rights Day.
   But that recharged movement is expected to lead hundreds of
thousands of people back onto the streets Sunday for human rights
rallies that will also celebrate the people's stunningly successful
battle for more democracy.
   The movement began to regain strength on Nov. 19 when 30,000
people marched in Prague to denounce police brutality at an earlier
rally.
   Huge anti-government demonstations followed, some led by
Alexander Dubcek, the former party chief whose reform movement was
crushed in 1968.
   On Nov. 24, party leader Milos Jakes and the rest of the
Communist leadership resigned. By Nov. 29, the Communists had given
up their 41-year monopoly on power. On Dec. 3, Premier Ladislav
Adamec named a government that gave non-Communists only five seats
in a 21-member Cabinet and left Communists in control of all key
portfolios.
   Hundreds of thousands of people immediately took to the streets
in protest, and the opposition threatened a general strike on
Monday if there was no new government by Sunday.
   Adamec tried again to form a new government, but he quit on
Thursday after complaining he could not work under opposition
pressure.
   Calfa was tapped as premier, and on Friday the Communists, the
opposition and other political parties held talks and hammered out
an agreement on the `` government of national understanding'' sworn
in Sunday.

<HEAD>Actress in Coma After Plunge From Stage During Blackout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An actress was hospitalized in
a coma Sunday after plunging from the stage into a basement during
a blackout for a scene change in a production of ``Camelot.''
   Gaynor Young, an understudy who had been pressed into the
starring role of Guinevere, was listed in critical condition in the
intensive care unit of Pretoria's H.F. Verwoerd Hospital. Hospital
officials said she suffered brain injuries and a broken arm and
wrist.
   She fell roughly 40 feet during a scene change in Saturday
night's performance of the musical at the State Theater in
Pretoria. The audience did not know at first what had happened, but
the performance was canceled after theater staff found that Ms.
Young had plunged down an opening in the stage.
   Ms. Young had filled in as Guinevere because the top-billed
actress, Kate Normington, lost her voice after Friday's performance.

   Two moderate earthquakes rattled Athens on
Sunday, but police reported no damage or injuries.
   The temblors, registering 4.5 and 3.6 on the Richter scale of
ground motion, struck shortly after midnight, the Athens Geodynamic
Institute reported.
   Their epicenter was between the islands of Chios and Evoia 70
miles northeast of Athens, the institute said. A spokeswoman for
the institute added that the quakes were felt in some parts of
Athens.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A magnitude 4 quake can cause moderate damage in a
populated area.

   Pope John Paul II on Sunday canonized a
Belgian cleric and teacher who died early in the 20th century,
hailing him for his obedience and humility.
   The ceremony elevating Brother Mutien Marie Wiaux to sainthood
took place during a Mass at St. Peter's Basilica attended by 10,000
pilgrims, including Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens.
   Wiaux was born in 1841 in Mellet and entered the Brothers of the
Christian Schools at Gosselies at age 15. He taught design and
music to children for 58 years in the school at Malonne.
   In the homily in Italian, French and Flemish, John Paul praised
the new saint as ``a very simple cleric who in the course of 60
years of religious life spent in obscurity, carried out the laws of
the Brothers of the Christian Schools with complete generosity.''
   Wiaux died in January 1917.

   Lancashire County Cricket Club has
voted to allow women members, ending a ban that endured since the
club's foundation in 1864.
   The club announced Saturday at its headquarters in Manchester
that the men had voted 2,046-961 for the change which will allow
women to watch matches beside them in the pavilion and play an
equal role at meetings.
   ``Most men want to bring their wives to matches and watch the
game with them,'' said Robin Monks, a member who voted for the
change.
   Before the vote, women were only allowed to be subscribers,
denied voting rights and access to the spectators' pavilion.
   The vote leaves only one other British cricket club, Middlesex,
that does not permit women members.

   The Warsaw Pact's denunciation of its invasion of
Czechoslovakia 21 years ago put a finishing touch on Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign to convince the world the
Kremlin is at one with the West in rejecting the tyranny of his
predecessors.
   As one former satellite country after another has yielded in
recent weeks to public demands for reform after four decades of
Communist rule, Gorbachev has stuck to his word. He has bid for
membership in a world community of nations, and he is making it
clear he is willing to pay the dues.
   Those dues include making a break with the past and acts such as
sponsoring communist uprisings abroad, sending troops into
Afghanistan and ignoring treaty obligations.
   After the withdrawal from Afghanistan, Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze admitted to the new Soviet legislature that the
invasion was illegal from the start. And he acknowledged what the
United States claimed for years: that a giant radar installation in
Siberia violated the U.S.-Soviet Antiballistic Missile Treaty and
would be dismantled.
   The Soviet Union's expansionism was at the heart of the Cold
War. Competing ideologies could co-exist but Soviet hegemony,
particularly in Eastern Europe after World War II, frightened those
who would be free, from Berlin to the fields of the American Middle
West.
   Nowhere was Moscow's determination to control its satellites
more evident than in Czechoslovakia, where Warsaw Pact tanks
crushed the Prague regime's attempt in 1968 to ease strict central
controls and give Communism ``a human face.''
   Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev's rationale for stepping in to
prevent Czechoslovakia from choosing its own course was that there
could be no retreat from socialism. It became known as the Brezhnev
Doctrine and kept the Kremlin's Eastern European neighbors in check
for two decades.
   The doctrine's thesis of limited sovereignty for countries
within the Soviet orbit became a symbol of the Kremlin's domination
over its allies.
   Gorbachev first signaled his willingness to reconsider the
doctrine when he visited Prague in April 1987, two years after
taking power.
   In a tentative recognition that the ruling parties in other
socialist countries needn't follow Moscow in lock step, he said,
``Foreign parties determine their political course with due regard
for national conditions.''
   But it was months later, when addressing Communist Party leaders
from many countries where they were in and out of power, that
Gorbachev said they were free to seek their own solutions to
national problems.
   ``Unity does not mean being identical or uniform,'' he told
them. ``We have also become convinced that socialism does not, and
cannot, have a model with which all (socialist systems) are
compared.''
   Just one year ago, in an address to the United Nations that most
clearly spelled out his foreign policy goals, Gorbachev endorsed
the Western idea that all people should have the freedom to choose
their own political system.
   It remained, however, for the Kremlin to live up to his words.
   Last July, after Hungary embarked on a course toward free
elections and the Polish government agreed to legalize Solidarity
as an independent trade union, leaders of the Warsaw Pact met in
Bucharest, Romania, and declared they would not interfere in each
other's domestic reforms.
   Weeks later, Solidarity controlled the parliament and Gorbachev
spoke with Polish Communist Party officials by telephone,
reportedly assuring them he would not object to a coalition
government led by Solidarity. A non-communist, Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
was elected prime minister, ending 40 years of Communist rule in
Poland.
   Gorbachev visited East Berlin in October and, according to East
German party sources, made clear no Warsaw Pact troops would be
called in to quell protests of the hard-line regime of party chief
Erich Honecker. Without Moscow to prop him up, Honecker was ousted
12 days later. On Nov. 9 the Berlin Wall was ruptured.
   In the fall, after President Bush had visited Hungary and Poland
and after Washington began to receive reports that Gorbachev might
be in political trouble at home, the U.S. administration ended a
protracted policy review and concluded the Kremlin meant what
Gorbachev said.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III called it a
``historic opportunity,'' a chance to ``leave behind the postwar
period with the ups and downs of the Cold War,'' and he declared
U.S. support for the Soviet leader's reform efforts.
   Gorbachev declared himself sympathetic with all the reform
movements rending the once-unified East Bloc.
   ``They are extremely different in their starting conditions,
economic possibilities, in their level of political culture and
historical heritage,'' Tass paraphrased Gorbachev as telling a
foreign visitor. ``But they have a common direction, which fosters
the building of a European home, for it makes the countries closer,
more open and creates new opportunities for human contact and an
equal exchange.''
   On Sunday, Czechoslovakia formed its first non-Communist
dominated government in 41 years.
   Czechoslovakia's rush to escape the hard-line Communist rule
that has dominated since the Soviet invasion 21 years ago received
Gorbachev's public endorsement last week as hundreds of thousands
poured into the streets to demand reform.
   Asked at a news conference on the eve of his summit with Bush to
comment on the ill-fated ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968,
Gorbachev reminded his audience the crackdown took place in an
atmosphere charged by the superpower arms race and an deological
struggle between East and West.
   But the reform movement, he said, ``was right at that time and
is right now.''
   Last Monday, after gathering to hear Gorbachev's report on his
talks with Bush in Malta, the leaders of the Warsaw Pact nations
that took part in the Czechoslovak invasion agreed the action had
been a mistake.
   A statement by the heads of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary,
East Germany and Poland said the entrance of their troops
constituted ``interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign
Czechoslovakia and must be condemned.''
   Romania, still run by hard-liner Nikolae Ceausescu, was not a
participant in the invasion and did not join in issuing the
statement. Czechoslovakia itself had issued an earlier condemnation.

   Czechoslovaks who took to the
streets only two weeks ago to demand democratic reform were out in
force Sunday morning but this time to shop for Christmas.
   As political leaders searched for a new president for the
nation, crowds lined up in Wenceslas Square to buy candles set in
sparkled pine cones and gold-sprayed mistletoe. Later, they
returned to celebrate the naming of a new government.
   But revolution or not, it was Silver Sunday.
   Stores open on Sunday only during the three weeks before
Christmas. Bronze Sunday, the first, is subdued. Gold, the last, is
chaos. Silver is merely frenetic.
   Mothers with prams plowed through crowds in the biting cold.
Speakers blared ``White Christmas'' sung in Czech by someone who
was not Bing Crosby.
   Scrawny trees sickened by acid-rain were on sale. But on
Prague's picture-book Old Town Square, a giant healthy fir was
alight with gay color.
   Tinsel and ornaments hung in windows displaying fish food and
deodorant. Fake snow made of plastic foam swirled over stacks of
grapefruit juice labeled in Arabic in the window of one store.
   At the department store Kotva, shoppers clogged the escalators
on all five floors.
   Fathers in the toy department eyed models of flashy cars they
could not possibly afford.
   From the basement cheese cooler to the fourth-floor furniture
display, shoppers pawed over merchandise with a touch of
resignation. The most desirable items were marked ``sold.''
   Ladislav Trojan, a Prague cab driver perusing the thinly stocked
electronics department, shook his head and made his point in
halting English:
   ``Problem is not to be expensive. Problem is to be.''
   That is, few quality goods were to be had at any price.
Czechoslovakia has kept itself out of debt by spurning consumer
imports from anyone but Soviet bloc partners.
   Politics pervaded the scene in posters taped to walls and
windows, but shoppers had other things on their mind.
   Martin Cipro, a philosophy student wheeling a full basket in the
Kotva food section, paused for a brief interview. ``I think there
will be more to buy with freedom,'' he said, edging off toward the
canned fruit.
   On an open square near Kotva, artisans of Czechoslovakia's
minuscule private sector sold clay bells, ceramic jewelry and odd
bits of decoration in a market that appears only at Christmas.
   The busiest stand sold walnuts and apples.
   No Santa Claus was in sight. The Slavic St. Nicholas wears a
robe and miter, carries a fancy shepherd's crook and does not hang
out on street corners.
   Each Dec. 6, costumed St. Nicks flanked by devils and angels
help begin the holiday season with a moonlight procession on the
medieval Charles Bridge. This year, a horned and tailed marcher
carried a sign reading:
   ``Even devils stay clear of the hellish politics of the
Communist Central Committee.''
   On Silver Sunday, however, a new government was sworn in, the
first not dominated by Communists in 41 years. President Gustav
Husak resigned.
   Off Wenceslas Square, a tree seller named Ludek said he thought
business was about the same as last year. ``But this is a much
happier Christmas,'' he said.

   A 25-year-old woman was killed in a freak
accyl window, striking her in the head.
   Brenda G. Warner of Watsontown died of multiple skull fractures
and massive cerebral injuries, said Lycoming County Coroner George
W. Gedon.
   She was sitting in the back seat of the car on the lap of her
husband, Carl Warner Jr., state police said. Warner and two others
were treated for minor injuries. Two other passengers were not hurt.
   The accident occurred early Saturday near Elimsport in
north-central Pennsylvania when the horse ran onto the road and
into the path of the car, according to police.
   When the car struck the animal, the horse rolled onto the roof,
and its hoof smashed through the passenger door window, police said.
   The accident killed the animal.

   A judge who calls himself a born-again

   Cabell County Circuit Judge Alfred Ferguson was removed from the

   ``Although I am not personally aquainted with the plaintiff, I

``Being a born-again Christian, I am very prejudiced as to this

   The case was filed by Kenneth Edward Chance Jr., an inmate

Moundsville. Chance is suing the state because prison officials
allegedly won't let him practice Satanism.

   Two months after the Oct. 17
earthquake crumbled their homes and left them to sleep in parks and
hotels, some of the city's homeless families are finding shelter in
mobile homes.
   The 43 mobile homes that residents began moving into Saturday
will not be enough to shelter 800 to 1,000 people officials
estimate were left homeless by the 7.1-magnitude quake. The temblor
destroyed parts of the agricultural town near the quake's epicenter
in Santa Cruz County.
   ``I am very happy because as soon as I have my baby, now I know
I have a place to come home to and my own bed,'' said Armanda
Delgado, who is eight months pregnant and relieved to be moving her
family of five into its new home.
   The Delgado family took the keys Saturday to one of the
three-bedroom homes erected by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
   ``This is a big luxury,'' said Delgado, who has been sleeping
with her husband and three daughters in their car, in a shelter or
in a hotel room. Delgado, whose husband works in a florist's shop,
said, ``The best thing is that the children will have their
separate bedrooms. Before, we all lived in one room.''
   FEMA is developing other mobile home sites in Santa Cruz, San
Benito and Monterey counties, as well as in the St. Francis School
in Watsonville, where another 33 mobile homes are scheduled to
arrive.
   Each family will be allowed to live rent free in the home for 18
months, after which FEMA workers will try to find them permanent
homes.
   Another homeless mother, Alicia Arrellano, said she was relieved
to bring her 8-month-old son out of the cold in the family's tent
at Callaghan Park.
   ``There were lots of fevers, colds, earaches,'' she said.
   Estimates of the number of homeless in Watsonville vary. Minerva
Perez Stubbs, a worker with the Earthquake Housing Fund, said
emergency workers place the number at closer to 3,000 to 4,000
people they say are living in cars, lean-tos and back yards evading
English-speaking officials they do not trust.

<HEAD>Antique State Fair Carousel in Danger of Going to Auction Block Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 75-year-old carousel at the Minnesota
State Fair is threatened a second time with auction and possible
dismemberment if preservationists can't pay off a loan by the end
of the month.
   The carousel, with 68 hand-carved, wooden horses, was put up for
sale a year ago by its private owners and was bought at the last
minute by a non-profit organization called Our Fair Carousel.
   Under terms of a $1.3 million loan guarantee from the St. Paul
City Council, if Our Fair Carousel can't pay off the loan by Dec.
29, the city will make the payment and take possession of the
carousel.
   If that happens, Mayor George Latimer wants the city to sell off
the carousel, in pieces if necessary, to recoup its losses.
   The head of the preservation group, Peter Boehm, says $375,000
still must be raised to pay off the loan.
   Although money continues to trickle in and artists are donating
proceeds from the sale of some of their works, Boehm says he
doesn't think that can save the carousel.
   ``This isn't enough to put us over the top,'' Boehm said of the
efforts, which include 100 members of the Twin Cities Decorative
Arts Guild who are making note cards and handpainted wooden horses
to sell. ``But it should demonstrate the kind of support we have in
the community.''
   The intricately carved carousel was created in 1914 by the
Philadelphia Toboggan Co. and since then has been ridden just 12
days a year at the state fairgrounds in northwestern St. Paul.
   Boehm believes Minnesota companies can save the carousel. He has
asked dozens of companies for contributions of $5,000 to $25,000.
So far, six corporations or foundations have pledged money.
   ``I'm befuddled. I don't understand why they can't understand
the validity of this project,'' he said. ``The usual response is:
`We have more people asking than we have money to give.'''
   He wishes a company would embrace the carousel as a marketing
tool.
   ``Wouldn't this seem to be more marketable than the Will Steger
expedition? Wouldn't a company rather be associated with happy kids
on a carousel than a guy with a frostbitten nose?'' he said.
   Steger, from Ely in northeastern Minnesota, is leading an
international, six-man ski and sled dog team on a 4,000-mile trek
across Antarctica.
   Our Fair Carousel has raised about $300,000 from donations,
T-shirt sales and profits from the carousel's run at this year's
State Fair. It also has $623,000 in pledges.
   St. Paul Mayor-elect Jim Scheibel said he's waiting to see if
there might be some kind of refinancing options or a way to extend
the loan.
   But Boehm said he doubts a delay would be helpful.
   ``If the corporations won't give this year, when there's a
deadline, there's no reason to believe that they'll give next
year,'' he said. ``If I thought they would, I'd plead with the City
Council for an extension.''

<HEAD>Experts on Hernando De Soto Trail Say Route Not Easily Traced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The exact route taken across Mississippi
by 16th-century Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto may never be
known, say experts who attended a Mississippi De Soto Trail
Commission Symposium.
   ``Unless something really concrete is discovered, I think it
will be a very flexible route or corridor,'' said James Atkinson of
Tupelo, an archeologist for the Natchez Trace Parkway.
   Six of the nation's top De Soto experts presented differing
views on the explorer's travels through Mississippi and the
Southeast during the symposium Friday at the Mississipi University
for Women in Columbus.
   De Soto traversed 10 states in search of fame and fortune during
the 16th century. Instead, he found unfriendly Indians during a
winter layover in Mississippi and the booty _ a handful of
freshwater pearls _ was disappointing, historians say. During the
four-year quest, he lost half of his 600 men and ultimately his own
life.
   The commission is gathering scholarly data to be used in a
route-designation study, said Patricia Galloway of the state
Department of Archives and History.
   The state De Soto Trail Commission was established by the
Legislature in 1988 to study the route. An examination of the
explorer's route across the southeastern United States is being
conducted by the U.S. Park Service.
   Galloway agreed that De Soto's exact trail may never be known.
She said any designation may only be of a corridor between the
different locations where De Soto is alleged to have crossed the
Mississippi River and where he spent the winter of 1540.
   ``There really wouldn't be any harm in that,'' she said. ``The
public would then understand that history is just not so simple.''

   There could be a secret microphone on your
telephone line, in your table lamp, in that briefcase sitting next
to your desk _ or even under your bed.
   Your neighbors could be listening in on those intimate calls
you've been making on your cordless or cellular telephone.
   Or your boss could be eavesdropping on your office at work.
   America is caught in a wave of high-tech snooping, according to
privacy advocates who blame cheap, easily obtainable gadgets that
can be bought through the mail, in electronics stores or in ``spy
shops.''
   Some examples:
   _One-way wireless intercoms. These tiny devices, which can be
secreted inside any household electrical device such as a lamp or
electric clock, will transmit conversations to a receiver placed on
the same electrical circuit, such as from a conference room to a
basement. They're available at electronics stores for $24.95.
   _Spy briefcases. With a flick of their handles, these
normal-looking attache cases will record, loud and clear, any
sounds in a room for hours. They cost between $600 and $900.
   _Infinity transmitters. Attach one to a phone and call it from
another phone. The bugged phone does not ring. Instead it becomes a
microphone that will pick up everything within 30 feet. Yours for
just $99.95.
   _Baby tenders. These innocuous intercom systems allow parents to
monitor an infant's room from another part of the house. Trouble
is, these radio devices also put out signals that can be heard by
neighbors, or by snoops.
   _Voice-activated tape recorders. Put one under a bed to catch an
unfaithful spouse, or in your pocket to secretly record a
conversation. Cost: $75 and up.
   _Listening aids. Designed to look like small portable radios or
tape players, they can, as the ads say, let you hear what people
are saying about you across the room. $49.95.
   Devices like these _ plus counter-bugging gadgets _ will be on
display this week in Washington at Surveillance Expo '89, which
organizer Jim Ross says is the first non-government show to focus
on surveillance and countersurveillance.
   One exhibitor will show a belt pager that actually is a tiny TV
camera.
   ``He has a transmitter on his back and a beeper on a belt.
Wherever he points the beeper he's broadcasting a picture to a
receiver.'' The device has a range of a ``few hundred feet, but
could be boosted,'' Ross said in an interview last week.
   ``He also has one built into a tie clip and another that looks
like a sprinkler head. That's a big seller, he tells me,'' Ross
said.
   Another exhibitor will show how to use a touchtone telephone to
modify computer programs that control sophisticated office phone
systems. The exhibitor used it ``so he could monitor his boss'
phone calls,'' Ross said.
   In many workplaces, interoffice phone systems have replaced
traditional clappers and bell ringers with musical tone pulses. The
systems require that the phone receivers stay turned on all the
time, which turns them into microphones, Ross said.
   And employers increasingly monitor employee's phones to check on
efficiency and performance.
   ``What we have here is a massive assault on our constitutionally
guaranteed right and expectancy of privacy,'' said Rudolph
Brewington, a Washington free-lance journalist who claims his
ex-wife victimized him as part of a divorce proceeding with a
voice-activated tape recorder.
   Manufacturers say their devices all have legal uses and that it
is up to the buyer, not the seller, to make sure laws are not
broken. But Brewington and others say manufacturers know these
devices are being used illegally and are doing nothing to prevent
it.
   Manufacturers ``have not developed any type of inhibiting device
on these products; they merely sell them,'' Brewington said in an
interview. Even though manufacturers often include warnings about
illegal use in their advertising, ``They know exactly how the
products are being used.''
   Brewington, along with another journalist, Robert Moore Jr., was
instrumental in getting the U.S. Postal Service to begin warning
customers in September that it is illegal to mail devices intended
to intercept wire or oral communications.
   Title 18 of the U.S. Code prohibits the manufacture, sale,
possession, advertisement, mailing and use of devices ``primarily
useful for the purpose of surreptitious interception of wire or
oral communcations.''
   The phrase ``primarily useful'' is a key point of contention for
manufacturers who say their devices serve legitimate purposes.
   But there also is another catch in the law, Section 2511, which
was enacted primarily to allow law enforcement officials to place
listening devices on informants during an investigation.
   Section 2511 allows recording when one person is a party to the
conversation and gives prior consent _ the doctrine of ``one party
consent.''
   The law does not specify who the consenting party is _ the
person taping or being taped. California, Pennsylvania, Florida and
Michigan have enacted laws requiring that all parties give consent.
   A bill by Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., is pending in the House
that would require all non-law enforcement parties to agree to
taping, while also requiring beep tones on voice-activated
recorders.
   But Ross, a countersurveillance expert, says the problem is
larger than surreptitious listening.
   ``People are not really attuned to the fact that they may be
heard or eavesdropped on,'' he said. Users of cellular and cordless
phones often don't realize their conversations are being broadcast
on radio waves. Cordless phone users sometimes can overhear other
cordless conversations, and people using police ``scanners'' can
intercept cellular phone calls.
   ``Horror stories abound,'' Ross said.
   Ross recalled a man in Phoenix using a police scanner who
intercepted a neighbor's baby tender.
   The parents ``had put the baby tender in the baby's room and the
parents were behind a paper-thin wall in the next room. The baby
was quiet, but the parents weren't being quiet,'' Ross recalled the
scanner operator saying. ``What he was hearing shouldn't have been
broadcast all over North Phoenix.''

<HEAD>Hotel Queen To Be Sentenced This Week For Tax Evasion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge decides Tuesday whether Leona Helmsley,
the billionaire hotel queen, must exchange her designer clothes and
country estate for prison garb and a cell.
   Mrs. Helmsley, the notoriously picky and sharp-tongued
executive, is to be sentenced in Manhattan's federal court, where
she was convicted Aug. 30 at a highly publicized trial of evading
$1.2 million in federal taxes.
   The 69-year-old Mrs. Helmsley could receive up to 127 years in
prison if U.S. District Judge John M. Walker Jr. were to impose
consecutive, maximum sentences for each of 33 counts.
   The judge could give lesser time or spare Mrs. Helmsley from
prison altogether by sentencing her to probation or community
service. She also faces more than $7 million in fines.
   Even if Walker imposes a prison sentence, Mrs. Helmsley will
likely remain free while she appeals her conviction.
   Her attorney, Gerald Feffer, would not discuss the sentencing.
   The last obstacle to her sentencing was lifted last Monday when
Walker ruled that prosecutors did not use tainted evidence against
Mrs. Helmsley at the trial. Her lawyers had asked that her
conviction be set aside claiming evidence used against her was
obtained during 1985 grand jury investigations at which she had
been granted immunity to testify.
   At the time, the state was investigating possible sales tax
evasion by jewelers, furriers and other retailers.
   ``The court is satisfied that the government's evidence used in
the federal grand jury and at trial was derived from sources
independent of Mrs. Helmsley's immunized testimony on unrelated
matters,'' Walker said in a written decision.
   Mrs. Helmsley has avoided personal publicity since the daily
scrutiny of the two-month trial. She has, however, continued to be
featured as a regal perfectionist in advertisements for her hotels.
   Mrs. Helmsley and her 80-year-old husband, Harry, own a $5
billion real estate empire that includes 27 hotels _ the Helmsley
hotels in New York and the Harley chain based in Cleveland.
   Helmsley was indicted with his wife in 1988 but was found
mentally incompetent to stand trial. They still face prosecution on
charges of evading state taxes; no trial date has been set.
   Mrs. Helmsley was convicted of evading federal taxes from 1983
through 1985, most of it by fraudulently billing $3.1 million in
expenses from the Helmsleys' Greenwich, Conn., mansion, Dunnellen
Hall, to their business empire.
   Among the expenses were more than $1 million for a pool
enclosure with a marble dance floor; jade figures worth $500,000,
and a $130,000 indoor-outdoor sound system.
   Mrs. Helmsley's two co-defendants also will be sentenced
Tuesday. Joseph Licari and Frank Turco, both former Helmsley
executives, were convicted of helping in the tax fraud.

   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, attended
a communion service at St. John's Church on Sunday.
   Only a few dozen worshipers joined the couple at the 8 a.m.
service at the small yellow Episcopal church, across Lafayette Park
from the White House.
   A reporter asked Bush as he emerged why he had sent national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft to China.
   ``We'll have more to say about that later,'' Bush replied.
   St. John's calls itself ``the church of the presidents.'' The
Bushes frequently attended services there when he was vice
president. They have been to the church on several other occasions
this year, including a prayer service on Inauguration Day.
   Despite the 27-degree temperature, Bush wore no overcoat.
   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., an old friend of the Bushes,
hailed the president on his way out of church and got a ride in the
limousine to the White House.
   The Bushes had one other public appearance planned for Sunday:
attending an evening taping of an NBC-TV Christmas special,
``Christmas in Washington,'' at the Pension Building.

<TEXT>
   A defense consultant described by prosecutors
as a major figure in the Pentagon procurement scandal is scheduled
to go to trial Monday on charges of bribing a Marine Corps
contracting official.
   Thomas E. Muldoon and Leonard L. Ingram, a former executive of a
company that hired Muldoon as a defense consultant, are accused of
conspiring to pay bribes to Jack A. Sherman, a one-time Marine
Corps. procurement officer.
   The trial scheduled to begin Monday in U.S. District Court in
Alexandria, Va., would be only the second in the lengthy
investigation, known as Operation Ill Wind, into possible
multibillion-dollar procurement fraud.
   The investigation so far has yielded more than 25 convictions of
individuals and four corporations.
   The indictment against Muldoon and Ingram charges they were part
of a seven-year scheme to funnel payments of more than $80,000 to
Sherman for his help getting Pentagon business.
   In return, Sherman steered contracts worth more than $6.2
million to Lee Telecommunications, which became a subsidiary of
Whittaker Corp. in 1986, according to court documents.
   The contracts were to provide computers and electronic equipment
for an battlefield air-traffic control system known as ATACC.
   Whittaker Command and Control Systems, the Whittaker subsidiary
that absorbed Lee Telecommunications, along with two of its former
executives and another defense consultant, pleaded guilty in
September to charges of participating in the bribery scheme.
   Whittaker agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines and penalties.
   Scott M. Lamberth, a former vice president of the Whittaker
subsidiary, and John Franklin Van Tassel, who headed its
Fayetteville, Ark., facility agreed to cooperate with the
government's investigation as part of their guilty plea.
   San Diego defense consultant Donald Illeman also pleaded guilty
and agreed to cooperate.
   If convicted, Muldoon faces a maximum possible prison sentence
of 70 years and fines up to $1.04 million. The charges against
Ingram, a Lee stockholder and former vice president of the company
and the Whittaker subsidiary, carry a possible sentence of 95 years
and fines of up to $1.53 million.
   In the only other trial of the investigation, two executives of
Teledyne Electronics were convicted last spring of conspiracy and
wire fraud but were acquitted of charges they participated in a
bribery scheme to influence the award of Pentagon contracts. A
third Teledyne executive was acquitted altogether.
   On Friday, Justice Department prosecutors signaled they were
zeroing in on three other major figures in the Ill Wind
investigation with the guilty plea by Loral Corp.
   The New York-based defense company admitted it conspired to
obtain inside information about a contract to make radar detection
equipment for F-16 fighters and another to build a Navy blimp.
   The company, which agreed to pay $5.77 million in fines and
penalties, admitted that it paid defense consultant William M.
Galvin $578,000 to obtain confidential bid information about Air
Force and Navy contracts from two senior Pentagon officials.
   Galvin obtained information about a radar-detection equipment
contract from Victor D. Cohen, then a deputy assistant Air Force
secretary, according to charges that Loral admitted.
   Cohen was to personally benefit from passing information to
Galvin about the $43.4 million contract Loral was awarded, court
papers said.
   A statement of facts filed by prosecutors indicated that Cohen
shared some of the consulting fees Loral paid Galvin.
   On the Navy contract, Galvin also enlisted the aid of Melvyn
Paisley, an assistant Navy secretary for engineering, research, and
systems before going into business with Galvin in the spring of
1987.
   Galvin provided assistance for Loral's unsuccessful efforts to
win the blimp contract, according to court papers.
   Neither Galvin, Cohen nor Paisley has been charged. Attorneys
for Cohen and Paisley denied Friday their clients had done anything
illegal.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the same square where Soviet
tanks crushed Czechoslovak hopes for freedom two decades ago,
100,000 people gathered Sunday to laugh and cry and celebrate their
peaceful victory over Communist tyranny.
   ``We have been waiting for this moment for 40 years,'' said Vera
Balikova, a retired researcher at the National Academy of Sciences,
who just three weeks ago was standing on Wenceslas Square demanding
an end to the repressive regime.
   ``I remember the tanks. I remember what happened afterward. And
I am very glad that we have lived to see this day,'' she said,
touching the tiny red, white and blue ribbon pinned to her coat and
seen on nearly everyone in Prague in these last dramatic weeks.
   The demonstration, called to mark International Human Rights
Day, turned into an emotional victory celebration one hour after
the announcement of Czechoslovakia's first government not dominated
by Communists since 1948.
   The new 21-member government contains 10 Communists, two of whom
enjoy opposition support, seven non-party members and two members
each from the small Socialist and People's parties that were once
allied with the Communists.
   Just three weeks ago, two of the new ministers were being
persecuted as dissidents. Czechoslovaks are especially proud of
achieving their ``gentle revolution'' without so much as as a
broken window.
   ``Let's make sure this revolution keeps on flourishing, but let
us not allow anyone to smear dirt on its peaceful face,''
playwright Vaclav Havel said, speaking from a tiny balcony above a
sea of faces and flags filled like sails in the frosty wind.
   ``Long live Havel! Long live Havel!'' voices chanted in unison,
then ``Free elections! Free elections!''
   Havel, a founder of the Charter 77 human rights group and the
new opposition movement Civic Forum, spent more than four years in
jail for expressing his moral outrage in the face of
totalitarianism. Now, he is the most popular man in Czechoslovakia
and an obvious candidate for president.
   Gustav Husak, aside from Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu the last
hard-line Communist president in Eastern Europe, resigned Sunday.
   ``We haven't won yet,'' Havel told the crowd, ``but we have had
great success, and we have great hope.''
   Tears streaked the cheeks of many older people in the crowd who
remember democracy crushed under the boots of Nazi troops in 1938,
the post-World War II agreement at Yalta that pulled the Iron
Curtain down on their country, and the Soviet tanks that killed the
``Prague Spring'' on Aug. 21, 1968.
   Jiri Hajek, 77, was foreign minister that day. Later, he became
one of the brave band of dissidents battling for democracy and
human rights here.
   ``The fact that this beautiful, joyful day is also the day of
international human rights is no coincidence,'' Hajek told the
crowd.
   Recalling Czechoslovakia's democratic traditions, he noted
proudly ``between the world wars we were the only country east of
the Rhine where, for the whole time, respect for human rights was
regarded as a foundation of real democracy.''
   The 1938 invasion occurred after the Munich agreement of Britain
and France, which hoped to appease Adolf Hitler by giving him the
German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia.
   But the 1968 invasion shocked the world. Images of the stunned
faces of Czechoslovaks filled TV screens and newspaper pages and
drew sympathy from all nations cherishing individual liberty.
   Miroslava Mojzisova was on the square that day and returned
Sunday with her 10-year-old daughter.
   ``This is so beautiful,'' she said, smiling while her eyes
filled with tears. ``I wanted to bring Radka, too, because history
is being written.''
   Radka, summing up simply the feelings of all her countrymen on
the square, chimed in, ``This is wonderful. I like it all quite
well.''

<HEAD>New Roles for VOA, Radio Free Europe on Changing Continent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tidal wave of democracy sweeping Eastern
Europe is creating static for the U.S. government's two major radio
stations, whose mission is to beam the virtues of freedom into
lands that have none.
   But both the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, synonymous
with the battle for world public opinion during four decades of
Cold War, reject any suggestion their days may be numbered. On the
contrary, they argue, their task now is more important than ever.
   ``International broadcasters have an important role if we want
to see these trends continue,'' said Robert Coonrod, VOA's deputy
director. Despite the lifting of censorship in many East European
media, people ``still tune in to validate information they're
getting on their radio stations. Forty-five years have made them
doubtful about their own countries' radios,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, a maverick at VOA has created a stir with an
article in the latest edition of Foreign Policy magazine,
suggesting a consolidation of the two radio services.
   VOA's audience research officer Kim Andrew Elliott says ``the
functions of the VOA and RFE are becoming less distinct, creating
an opportunity to restructure U.S. international broadcasting.'' He
estimates that consolidation could save about $50 million annually.
   Elliott, speaking in an interview, also said it is ``reasonable
to expect that audience numbers will be reduced as domestic radio
stations improve'' in East European countries undergoing reform. He
said there were no figures available yet on listening trends over
the past few weeks of upheaval.
   Officials at both stations have publicly dissociated themselves
from Elliott's views, saying the stations' roles are completely
different.
   VOA's stated mission is to provide news and programs about
American government and society to the world. Broadcasting in 43
languages, it also airs editorials prepared under the guidance of
its parent organization, the U.S. Information Agency.
   Radio Free Europe, which serves Eastern Europe, and its sister
station Radio Liberty, which beams to the Soviet Union, were funded
covertly by the CIA until 1971 when Congress took over their
budgets and made them a private corporation under the supervision
of a presidentially appointed, bipartisan board of governors.
   The stations, which broadcast from their headquarters in Munich,
Germany, in 21 languages, have a clear mandate: to provide people
under authoritarian Communist rule with information about their own
countries, in an attempt to bring about political change.
   ``We'd like to think we played a role in all that's happening
now, through the free flow of information we provided through the
years,'' said Patricia Gates Lynch, RFE's director of corporate
affairs.
   The change sweeping the communist world has provided VOA and RFE
with bonanzas _ a cessation of all jamming and a chance to deploy
correspondents throughout the Soviet bloc. But it also presents
them with unprecedented challenges, not the least of which is
competition from newly liberalized radio stations in Eastern Europe.
   In response, VOA and RFE have gone into the ``how to'' business.
Both have been airing programs designed to appeal to the new quest
for free enterprise in the crumbling communist systems: how to
start a new business, how to set up a stock market, etc.
   RFE also has provided programs on how other countries write
constitutions, design education programs and write legal codes, as
the once-communist countries reshape their governments and
societies.
   The stations contend that between them they have an audience of
more than 100 million in Europe.
   To generate revenue amid growing U.S. budget austerity, VOA this
month began carrying advertising on its programs in Western Europe,
said Coonrod. It also hopes to attract European affiliates with the
promise of advertising revenue.
   RFE is considering a similar move, said Gates Lynch.
   But as long as both stations enjoy the broad support they have
in Congress, which has kept their funding level at an annual level
of $170 million and $190 million, respectively, such a move is
unlikely.
   Officials at both stations contend that any merger would be a
bureaucratic and logistical nightmare: VOA has about 2,800
employees, and RFE about 1700; VOA operates out of Washington,
while RFE is based in Germany.
   VOA's standing got an important boost when Chinese authorities
began their crackdown last June against pro-democracy protesters.
The Chinese government has been jamming VOA for months to deter the
droves of dissidents tuning in to its Mandarin and Cantonese
broadcasts.
   ``The China experience is fresh in everyone's mind,'' said
Coonrod. ``Changes in Eastern Europe are evolving, but they're not
yet rooted. We don't know that they're here to stay.''

Galvin $578,000 to obtain confidential bid information about Air
Force and Navy contracts from two senior Pentagon officials.
   Galvin obtained information about a radar-detection equipment
contract from Victor D. Cohen, then a deputy assistant Air Force
secretary, according to charges that Loral admitted.
   Cohen was to personally benefit from passing information to
Galvin about the $43.4 million contract Loral was awarded, court
papers said.
   A statement of facts filed by prosecutors indicated that Cohen
shared some of the consulting fees Loral paid Galvin.
   On the Navy contract, Galvin also enlisted the aid of Melvyn
Paisley, an assistant Navy secretary for engineering, research, and
systems before going into business with Galvin in the spring of
1987.
   Galvin provided assistance for Loral's unsuccessful efforts to
win the blimp contract, according to court papers.
   Neither Galvin, Cohen nor Paisley has been charged. Attorneys
for Cohen and Paisley denied Friday their clients had done anything
illegal.

   Flowers wilt and chocolates get eaten, but
Karl Koy can fashion a more durable gift, one that offers a
personalized Christmas wish, extols a recipient's virtues or takes
a few friendly jabs.
   For $16, Koy will record on a tape cassette a love ballad
commemorating a wedding or anniversary, a tribute to a newborn
child, a birthday ode or a humorous barb.
   ``This is something you can't get anywhere else,'' said Ruby
White of Peoria, who bought a song from Koy's business, Send A
Song, to celebrate the birth of her grandson and another to mark a
friend's recent promotion.
   ``Karl really did a nice job,'' Mrs. White said. ``The girl we
gave it to said she cried when she heard it. I think it's the
greatest gift you can get.''
   Koy came up with the idea for Send A Song a few months ago after
years of submitting topical, humorous songs to radio disc jockeys
around the nation. The songs were satirical looks at world events
and received wide play.
   ``This is a natural evolution of the songs I've been doing in
the past,'' said Koy, 41. ``It was always fun to hear them aired,
but it did nothing for my bank account. This is my attempt to write
songs and make a few bucks at the same time.''
   The enterprise gives Koy a chance to demonstrate his flair for
off-beat and serious song writing.
   Each category of song _ birth, birthday, wedding, anniversary,
achievement and Christmas wish _ has a unique set of words and
music.
   For every customer, Koy incorporates details that make the song
unique to the recipient. Then he plays the melody on his piano,
guitar and synthesizer, and sings most of the songs himself. He
hires a female vocalist upon request.
   He's ready for people who want to send a friend a birthday song
that brings a tear, makes them laugh or really gets under their
skin.
   ``I can be as nice or mean as people prefer on the birthday
songs,'' he said. ``Some of them can be real rock 'em, sock 'em
songs.''
   For a Christmas song from a husband to a wife, he wrote, ``It's
a grand nine years of bliss since we shared our marriage kiss;
there's been travel slides, horse rides, both together side by
side, and more than I can list...''
   Turnaround time on songs is usually about 24 hours.
   ``I bought one for my son's wedding and for the birth of our
grandchild,'' said Bob Weber of Marietta, Ga., who was so impressed
he circulated word of Koy's venture in a business newsletter he
writes.
   ``They're as cute as a button,'' Weber said. ``They're really
unique. It's a good idea. These songs won't wilt and die like
flowers. They won't run out of air like ballons. And it's more
personal than a greeting card.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Leaders Outline Militant Plans, Urge Whites to Join</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid leaders Sunday
announced a militant strategy of civil disobedience and political
pressure and urged South African whites to join them for the
``final onslaught on apartheid.''
   The plans were adopted late Saturday at a closed session of the
largest anti-apartheid conference ever held in South Africa. It was
attended by 4,662 black, white, Indian and mixed-race delegates
from 2,128 organizations.
   Several major black organizations to the left and right of
mainstream anti-apartheid groups either boycotted the conference or
were not invited.
   But Murphy Morobe, one the organizers, said the Conference for a
Democratic Future was a ``roaring success.''
   ``Business was concluded in a spirit of unity unprecedented in
any gathering in the past with such a disparate array of
organizations,' he said at a news conference.
   One resolution urged whites ``to break decisively with all
apartheid forces and side with the majority.'' It urged them to
conduct solidarity marches into black townships and proposed a
campaign to create new municipalities by merging white cities and
their adjoining black ghettos.
   Another resolution urged an escalation of confrontational
activity by black trade unions. It said workers should be prepared
to occupy the Johannesburg Stock Exchange if necessary to prevent
possible privatization of major state enterprises such as the
postal and transport services.
   ``We call upon our people to reject capitalism and free market
system,'' a resolution on economics said.
   Perhaps the most important resolution, Morobe said, was a demand
for non-racial elections for an assembly that would draft a
constitution establishing a one-person, one-vote system for South
Africa.
   President F.W. de Klerk has rejected the concept of such an
assembly. He has offered to negotiate a new constitution that would
extend limited political rights to the black majority of 28
million, but he wants black negotiators chosen in segregated
elections.
   Since taking power in August, de Klerk has made several
conciliatory moves aimed at promoting negotiations between blacks
and the nation's 5 million whites, who control the government and
the economy. He has freed some prominent political prisoners,
prohibited segregation of beaches, and permitted previously banned
opposition activities, including meetings like the conference.
   However, delegates adopted a resolution saying de Klerk's
proposals were ``designed to enmesh our organizations and people in
schemes to maintain the status quo.''
   ``The conference ... took the view that President de Klerk's
reform initiatives are devoid of substance,'' Morobe said.
   Other resolutions urged parents and students to defy school
segregation policies, demanded land redistribution and urged young
white men to refuse mandatory military service. Delegates also
demanded appointment of an independent commission to investigate
allegations that police death squads have killed government
opponents.
   Another resolution demanded an end to the state of emergency
imposed in June 1986. Many delegates belong to groups restricted by
emergency regulations.
   Most delegates were aligned to some degree with the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement and affiliated groups
in South Africa.
   The most notable absentees were Inkatha, a relatively
conservative Zulu organization opposed to the ANC's militant
tactics, and so-called Africanist groups, which oppose the ANC's
philosophy of non-racism.
   Although black unity remains elusive, Morobe said the conference
``far surpassed our expectations.''
   ``A firm basis was established for the political direction of
all anti-apartheid forces well into the 1990s, the decade of the
final onslaught against apartheid,'' he said.
   Observers from 19 countries attended the conference and
organizers said funding was provided by the Dutch government and
church groups from Denmark, Norway and Sweden. They said the
Canadian government had offered to finance regional follow-up
meetings.

<HEAD>Cambodian Refugees Mark Human Rights Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   SITE 2, Thailand (AP) _ Buddhist monks chanted prayers Sunday
before thousands of Cambodian refugees who gathered to appeal for
the human rights denied them for nearly two decades.
   The ceremony marking International Human Rights Day followed
clashes just outside this border camp Thursday and Friday that
killed at least one person and wounded two people, aid officials
said.
   Officials said the clashes involved Thai paramilitary personel
and Cambodian traders along the border, also the scene of
intensifying fighting in the 11-year-old civil war.
   Relief officials have documented numerous slayings, rapes and
beatings of Cambodians in refugee camps and their homelands by Thai
authorities, the three guerrilla groups and the
Vietnamese-installed government.
   ``Our people have already suffered too much because of human
rights violations,'' said Dr. Haing Ngor, who portrayed a survivor
of the brutal 1975-78 Khmer Rouge regime in the film ``The Killing
Fields.''
   ``Please help the suffering people of Cambodia, the most
suffering nation in the world,'' he said during the ceremony.
   The ceremonies, organized by U.N. relief officials, began with
Buddhist monks in saffron robes praying for peace and
schoolchildren singing a human rights song.
   ``Human rights is sometimes seen as a Western idea, an idea
alien to Cambodian culture,'' one monk, Yos Hut, told several
thousand of the camp's 140,000 residents. ``This is not true.''
   On a stage of bamboo and cloth, students in traditional costumes
danced and other refugees acted out a sketch of quarreling
neighbors who peacefully settle their disputes.
   Eight pigeons were released and flew outside the camp, where the
refugees are not supposed to go.
   After a minute of silence, some participants ventured into an
exhibition of paintings by refugees, showing the Khmer Rouge
killing victims and dumping them into mass graves and Vietnamese
soldiers bayoneting and raping Cambodians.
   At sundown, about 20 to 25 Western relief workers and about a
dozen refugees at Site 2 ended a 24-hour fast to appeal for the
protection of the Cambodians.
   ``All of these border camps are human rights violations in
themselves,'' said an organizer of the fast, Corinne Bowmaker of
the American Refugee Committtee.
   Millions have died in Cambodia since the 1970 military coup
ended the peaceful three-decade rule of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
The Khmer Rouge, who won the 1970-75 civil war, killed hundreds of
thousands of people before Vietnamese troops drove them from power
in late 1978. A civil war has raged since.
   Site 2 is controlled by the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front. Human Rights Day ceremonies were also held in Site B, the
main camp controlled by the forces of Prince Sihanouk, and Site 8,
the main Khmer Rouge camp.
   U.N. relief workers recently introduced into the camps judicial
systems reflecting the principles of the human rights declaration,
which the United Nations adopted 41 years ago Sunday.

   A problem with a fuel tank
pressurization system forced the Air Force on Sunday to postpone
the launch of a military navigation satellite.
   The countdown had progressed to just four minutes before liftoff
when trouble was detected. The launch team had only a 21-minute
``window'' in which to get the Delta 2 rocket off, not long enough
to work on the problem.
   Lt. Col. Ron Rand, an Air Force spokesman, said the culprit was
a faulty helium pressure regulator. Helium is used to pressurize
the rocket's fuel tanks.
   The launch was tentatively rescheduled for Monday at 12:54 p.m.
   The Delta 2 is to carry up a $65 million Navstar satellite that
is to join a network of four other spacecraft that tell U.S. and
allied military forces where they are within 50 feet anywhere in
the world.

   More than 50,000 people chanting
``Democracy!'' rallied Sunday in the biggest demonstration for
reform since the Communists consolidated power 43 years ago.
   Thousands of Bulgarians, many from provincial towns outside the
capital, braved snow and temperatures well below freezing to show
their support for 19 independent groups that organized the rally.
   The number of opposition groups has grown rapidly since the
start of Bulgaria's democracy movement less than a month ago, and
the group's unified stance represents a potential threat to the
ruling Communists.
   Only a few uniformed police guarded the area around the two-hour
rally, held in the vast square in front of the Aleksander Nevski
Orthodox Cathedral. Some officers slumped bored and cold in buses
on empty sidestreets.
   The crowd repeatedly cheered demands for democratic change
similar to reforms under way in other East bloc countries,
including eliminating the Communists' constitutional guarantee of a
leading role in society. Czechoslovakia and East Germany have made
such a change.
   At the end of the rally, a speaker read a resolution addressed
to Parliament that recognized moves toward liberalization since
Nov. 10, when leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted after 35 years of
rule and replaced by former Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov.
   But it said reforms were occurring too slowly and that the
Communist Party's policy-setting Central Committee should resign
because its members ``are politically and morally worn out.''
   The crowd wildly cheered that demand and roared ``tomorrow,
tomorrow.''
   The Central Committee was scheduled to meet Monday for the
second time in four days to discuss organizational matters.
   At Friday's meeting, four people were removed from the ruling
Politburo in a continuing shake-up to purge hard-liners associated
with Zhivkov and bring in reformers.
   Since Zhivkov's ouster, official papers have been full of
reports of corruption in the top party leadership, and speakers at
the rally demanded former officials account for any wrongdoing.
   The resolution presented also said officials and the opposition
should hold talks on new laws for free elections and freedom of the
press and assembly. It demanded an end to the Communist Party's
presence in the workplace and in police and military organizatons.
   Earlier, the crowd chanted ``Immediately! Immediately!'' when
Zhiliu Zhelev, a leading opposition activist, said: ``We need a
dialogue and an urgent program for the country to get out of its
economic crisis.''
   Officials last week acknowledged that the gross foreign debt
stands at $10 billon, and Bulgarians say some basic goods, such as
milk, cheese and coffee have become scarce.
   About 2,000 ethnic Turks at the rally chanted ``We want our
names back!'' a reference to a government assimilation campaign
that forced them to replace their Moslem names with Bulgarian ones.
   Ethnic unrest earlier this year sparked hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Turks to flee to neighboring Turkey.
   The resolution blamed the strife on the Zhivkov regime and said
a parliamentary commission including independent representatives
should be set up to investigate and find a peaceful solution.
   Hussan Belkov, an activist of the Society for the protection of
Human Rights, said some people who wanted to attend the rally were
stopped in several towns where ethnic Turks live.

   The Grinch who stole Ricardo
Hernandez's Christmas tree couldn't steal Southern California's
Christmas spirit.
   Hernandez walked outside one day last week and found that
someone had chopped down the 12-foot-tall pine tree growing in his
front yard that the family had decorated every Christmas for the
past 15 years.
   On Friday, he walked out and found that someone had planted a
new one, standing 7 feet tall.
   And, thanks to actor Richard Dreyfuss' wife, Jeramie, the
children in the neighborhood have Christmas toys.
   Hernandez thought he was on the trail of the first tree's thief
when he tracked its scattered needles from his house to a nearby
apartment. But the apartment's occupants turned out to be a poor
family who had thought they had gotten a good deal on a Christmas
tree.
   ``It was some old man with six kids,'' Hernandez said. ``He said
he had bought the tree a little earlier for $7 from a wino.''
   Hernandez didn't have the heart to take the tree back.
   But word of the incident spread.
   Then Mrs. Dreyfuss arrived with a carload of gifts. She had
included gifts for the three Hernandez children, for the six
children whose porch now houses the tree and for other youngsters
in the neighborhood.
   ``The kids were upset that somebody could steal a Christmas
tree,'' Hernandez said. ``I tried to convince them that they
couldn't steal the Christmas spirit.''

   Was it an invader from outer space?
   Joe Hendricks said he was in the crawl space of his home to do
some wiring when he spotted a heart-shaped, grayish mass hanging
about 3 feet from the low boards overhead. It was about a yard at
its widest point and roughly 16 inches deep with streaks of colors
that almost seemed to pulsate.
   ``I turned around and saw that and I thought, `what in the name
of God is that,''' he remarked. ``I thought it was a blob from
outer space.
   ``It really scared the living daylights out of me.''
   A closer look, and one or two stings, revealed it to be an
unusually large wasp nest.
   ``It's one of the biggest ones I've ever seen,'' said Lyle E.
Klostermeyer, owner of Lyle's Entomological Service in Walla Walla.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CZECHOSLOVAKIA _ A government controlled by non-Communists takes
power for the first time in 41 years, and tens of thousands of
people jammed the nation's streets to celebrate.
   Hard-line President Gustav Husak, who helped crush the 1968
``Prague Spring'' reform movement, resigns after swearing in the
new government, which includes two men who were persecuted as
dissidents until just two weeks ago.
   The new 21-member government contains 10 Communists, two of whom
enjoy opposition support, seven non-party members and two members
each from the small Socialist and People's parties, which recently
broke ties with the Communists.

   EAST GERMANY _ New Communist Party chief Gregor Gysi says he

   The four World War II Allies _ France, Britain, the United
States and the Soviet Union _ say they will meet Monday to discuss
the role of Berlin in East-West affairs.

   BULGARIA _ More than 50,000 people rally in Sofia in the biggest
pro-democracy demonstration since the Communists consolidated power
43 years ago. Speakers urge the Communists to speed up the pace of
reforms and some demand an end to their constitutionally guaranteed
monopoly on power.

   SOVIET UNION _ President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warns the
Communist Party leadership that their colleagues' fall from power
in Eastern Europe proves they must quickly solve Soviet domestic
problems or face similar ``excesses.''
   Estonians and Latvians vote in local elections expected to
result in defeat for huge numbers of Communist officials.
   In Moscow, 5,000 march in below-zero temperatures in support of
reformist parliamentarians and were left alone by police. But a
smaller group of several hundred Democratic Union supporters was
forcibly hustled off Pushkin Square after about 20 minutes, after
speakers ripped up photographs of Gorbachev and Soviet founder
Vladimir Lenin.

   The Delta Queen, one of two Mississippi
riverboats still carrying overnight passengers, is undergoing a
minor facelift and mechanical tuneup in preparation for the line's
100th anniversary.
   A huge crane pulled the 38-ton paddlewheel off the steamboat
Saturday.
   ``Since the wheel is the boat's only means of propulsion, we
periodically replace bucket boards and this year we'll be painting
the wheel it its entirety while it's off the boat,'' said Pat
Fahey, president of the Delta Queen Steamboat Co.
   The steamboat is scheduled to return to the water on Feb. 23 for
a New Orleans Mardi Gras cruise.
   The Mississippi Queen is the other steamboat to carry overnight
passengers on the Mississippi River and its tributaries.
   The company, the nation's oldest flag line, was founded in 1890
by a young river pilot and the Delta Queen, built in 1926, is the
28th steamboat the company has operated in its 100-year history.

<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, leader of the
failed ``Prague Spring'' reforms, said Sunday he would accept the
presidency if nominated by the people.
   In an interview with the official CTK news agency, the former
president said he has ``never abandoned political work'' since
being ousted after Warsaw Pact tanks crushed his short-lived
reforms in 1968.
   ``Now that after 21 years society is on the move, I must know
where my place is,'' Dubcek said.
   Gustav Husak, the hard-liner who replaced Dubcek as Communist
Party leader in 1969, resigned as president Sunday after swearing
in a new government that for the first time in 41 years is
dominated by non-Communists.
   Dubcek, who is retired from the forestry commission and lives in
Bratislava, said a recent opinion poll listed him as the leading
candidate for the job.
   ``The fact that the spontaneous call comes from the street
speaks for itself. Our ancestors used to say: Voice of the people,
voice of God,'' he said. ``The people will decide what happens
now.''
   If he is elected by Parliament, it would be a ``rehabilitation
of a people that was offended,'' by the invasion, he said. He
stressed that the current movement toward democracy is a
continuation of his reform efforts in 1968.
   Opposition leader Vaclav Havel also has widespread support for
president.
   Dubcek's statements were reported a few hours after the new
government was sworn in.
   Some political observers say Dubcek, who was stripped of his
membership in the party in 1970 but still considers himself a
Communist, is virtually the only person capable of taking over the
presidency as a symbol of national unity.
   Dubcek said his support so far has come spontaneously from the
street and not from official parties or organizations such as the
opposition Civic Forum. However, he hinted that he might welcome
such support.

<DATELINE>MORONI, Comoro Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The people on this volcanic
archipelago of perfume flowers and poverty are struggling to oust
European mercenaries who have dominated the nation during 14
bizarre years of independence.
   The long-simmering opposition to the 30 French and Belgian
mercenaries boiled over after President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane
was assassinated Nov. 26.
   Virtually all Comorans blame the mercenary-led Presidential
Guard, the main security force on the nation of four islands in the
Indian Ocean.
   A protest Saturday in Moroni, the capital, was the second in
three days broken up with tear gas by the 600-strong guard, headed
by Frenchman Bob Denard, a legendary soldier of fortune and veteran
of countless battles throughout Africa and Asia.
   ``The people will not be satisfied until the mercenaries
leave,'' said a businessman who asked to be identified only as
Abdou. ``The Comorans want to choose their own leader.''
   Interim President Said Mohamed Djohar, in a radio announcement
Friday, told people not to hold public gatherings.
   According to a source in contact with Djohar, the president
feels he is hostage to the guard. All his public statements must be
cleared by the mercenaries, said the source, who requested
anonymity.
   The island nation's 450,000 citizens are mostly illiterate,
exceedingly poor and politically unorganized, and they likely will
find it difficult to oust the mercenaries by themselves.
   The French and South Africans, the two largest aid donors to the
islands, suspended all assistance last week and are pressuring
Denard and his colleagues to leave.
   France has sent troops to its Indian Ocean island of Reunion,
but says it is preparing for possible evacuation of French citizens
from the Comoros, not military intervention.
   The French and the South Africans have done the most to entrench
Denard's mercenaries through the strange history of the Comoros.
   The islands declared their independence from France in 1975 and
Abdallah became president. Within a month, Denard helped engineer a
coup that put Ali Soilih in power.
   One of Soilih's first acts was to publicly burn all colonial
bureaucratic records. He fired the 3,000-member civil service and
replaced it with illiterate teen-agers. He also tried to ban Moslem
practices in a nation where mosques are the most prominent
structures in villages of simple grass huts.
   Soilih once dreamed he would be attacked by a man with a dog,
and his teen-age civil servants tried to carry out his order to
kill every dog on the islands.
   In 1978, Comoran exiles and the French gave their blessing to
another coup by Denard, who took a boatload of 50 mercenaries and
his pet German shepherd and captured the country in a few hours
while Soilih slept.
   Abdallah was restored to power and Soilih was shot dead two
weeks later, purportedly while trying to escape.
   Denard, now 60, initially was greeted as a liberator hero and
decided to remain. He has become a citizen, converted to Islam and
married his sixth wife, a Comoran less than half his age.
   Denard and other mercenaries have become extremely wealthy and
have extensive business interests. For example, the U.S. Embassy
building is owned by former mercenary Roger Ghys.
   Denard began developing ties with South Africa in the early
1980s.
   South Africa has given the Comoros about $5 million in annual
aid and about half went to the Presidential Guard, sources said.
   Shortly before Abdallah's death, South Africa told the Comoros
it was ceasing aid for the guard, and Denard and Abdallah argued
over funding to the force, according to sources.
   Denard has said he was not involved in Abdallah's death and has
no plans to leave. Last week, he arrived at Moroni's main mosque
and sought to swear his innocence before senior religious leaders.
   They refused to enter with Denard. More than 1,000 men in the
square chanted, ``Assassin! Assassin!'' when he emerged afterward.
   No one has been arrested in Abdallah's assassination, and the
government has said only that ``uncontrolled elements'' were
responsible.
   The 500-man army has been disbanded and the military-style guard
patrols the increasingly empty streets in jeeps mounted with
machine guns.
   The Comoros' anemic economy is dependent on foreign aid and
certain to suffer without it.
   The nation has virtually no manufacturing and is known primarily
for their ylang-ylang, a greenish-yellow flower exported for use in
French perfumes.
   ``We want the French to help force the mercenaries out,'' said
an opposition figure who requested anonymity. ``The mercenaries
came from there and that's where they should go back.''

<HEAD>Donald Trump Shows Interest in Ambassador Hotel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire Donald Trump is considering
developing the landmark Ambassador Hotel property, a former haven
for celebrities and site of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's assassination,
city officials say.
   Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilman Nate Holden said they met with
Trump last week to discuss a potential future for the 68-year-old
hotel, which has been closed for nearly a year. It wasn't
immediately clear, however, if Trump's plans include razing the
building, a move opposed by some local groups.
   ``He simply said he had an interest in the hotel,'' Bradley said
Friday. ``What that interest is, I don't know.''
   The 494-room hotel and its Cocoanut Grove nightclub were visited
over the years by such celebrities as Elvis Presley, Elizabeth
Taylor, Bing Crosby and Howard Hughes. Kennedy was assassinated
there moments after declaring victory in the 1968 California
Democratic presidential primary.
   Trump spoke of a combined retail, office and residential
development on the 23.5-acre site, Holden said.
   The site west of downtown was acquired in September for $64
million by Wilshire Center Partners, which has announced plans to
build residential and commercial buildings on the site.
   The Los Angeles Unified School District has also expressed
interest in acquiring the site for a high school because nearby
campuses are overcrowded and 8,000 students must be bused elsewhere.

   His formal title is police Deputy Superintendent
William Celester but everyone knows him as Billy, the former gang
member who learned early to be quick on his feet.
   Celester started out as a teen-age member of the Marseilles
Dukes but today spends 16-hour shifts running things down at Area B
police station in Roxbury, where murder and drug abuse cast a
constant, long shadow.
   He has reinstituted neighborhood block watches, has his officers
walking regular beats and meets daily with community activists.
He's at the schools, in the churches, cruising the streets late at
night.
   The hard-won relationship between the people who live on Area
B's raggedy streets and those who police them has caught the
attention of leaders nationwide, including Mayor-elect David
Dinkins of New York, who has been considering Celester for a top
police post.
   Gang- and drug-related crimes are still rampant, but there's a
new openness in the neighborhoods. Wherever he goes, Celester walks
into open arms. People honk and wave to him on the streets,
residents of the city's housing projects swing open their doors
when they see him coming.
   ``These are my people,'' Celester, 46, said during a recent
interview at his chaotic office. ``My whole life has prepared me
for this job,''
   The story could have come out differently.
   Celester, a ninth-grade dropout, spent his teens running with
the Dukes. He married at 16, divorced a year later and got caught
up in street fights. He was sentenced to six months in jail for
failing to pay child support for a son born out of wedlock.
   By the time he'd finished his jail term at age 17, Celester says
he was already embittered.
   ``I came out and, sure, I was angry. I hated the system and
didn't want anything to do with it,''he said. ``I could easily have
gone the other way, but I had support _ something a lot of kids
today don't have.''
   Celester drew inspiration from community elders such as former
state Sen. Royal L. Bolling, who convinced him a life outside the
law was no life at all.
   ``They convinced me not to hate,'' Celester said. ``They
convinced me to pick myself up and work to make things better.''
   Celester went back to school, eventually earning a master's
degree in criminal justice. He joined the police force in the
mid-1960s at the suggestion of civil rights activists, who thought
the 23-year-old should take a shot at restoring the community's
pride.
   ``Billy grew up here and he takes trouble on the streets to
heart,'' said Bolling. ``He knows the people he's dealing with very
personally and he has a deep understanding of the problems.''
   During his 25 years with the Boston police, Celester has kept
the vision of a more simple time, one in which grandparents
strolled the streets at night and mothers were seldom afraid for
their children.
   ``Babies are dying,'' said Celester, who has three grown
children. ``I can't get used to seeing kids laying dead in the
streets.''
   More than half of the 100 or so homicides committed in Boston so
far this year have been in Area B and 3,486 drug arrests were
logged in those same neighborhoods between January and October.
   Activist Georgette Watson said street violence is tough to stop,
but Celester has had a series of ``rap sessions'' with gang members
and the tenuous relationship could make a difference.
   Watson said gang members aren't open to anyone, but they relate
to Celester because he was raised in Roxbury and is a black man.
   ``You can't really tell if they trust him or not, but at least
they're talking,'' she said.

   After 32 years of touring the country music
circuit, Mel Tillis plans to settle down to regular performances in
Branson, a country music mecca in this Ozarks tourist area.
   Tillis announced Saturday that he will begin a regular schedule
on weekends in April. In May, when the full tourist season begins,
he will go to a six-day-a-week, two-show-a-day schedule and
continue it through October.
   ``I've been in and out of here for 11 years,'' Tillis said. ``I
love the people, love the water. I like the atmosphere. The people
come to you, so I don't have to go all over America looking for
them.''
   Branson, a town of about 3,000 between two lakes in the Ozarks
region of southwest Missouri, drew about 4 million tourists in 1988
to its country music theaters, lakes and amusement parks featuring
Ozarks-life and hillbilly themes.
   Its Country Music Boulevard, a strip of about 21 music halls,
has attracted growing numbers of Nashville performers in recent
years, including Roy Clark, Freddy Fender, Cristy Lane and Boxcar
Willie.
   Tillis initially will lease a theater, but said he might buy it,
depending on how he handles the strain of performing two-shows a
day, six days a week.
   ``It all depends on business and how well I get along with it,''
he said.
   Tillis said he will be performing with his band, the
Statesiders, and his son, Mel Tillis Jr.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Bill Bradley is sounding big themes as
his 1990 Senate race nears and speculation intensifies about his
presidential aspirations, trying on new audiences some images he's
been testing since May.
   When the New Jersey Democrat addressed more than 1,000
supporters at a $500-a-head fund-raiser last week, most of his
remarks came from a graduation speech he delivered at Middlebury
College.
   Then, he was telling the Vermont students how to strive for
excellence and use public service to help change the world they
were entering.
   When he spoke last Monday in East Brunswick, N.J., about
patriotism and how the United States should set a quiet example for
other nations through sound domestic policy, he came across more
like the national politician many hope he'll become: a Democratic
president.
   Although many supporters privately are champing at the bit to
see him announce a 1992 candidacy, they say _ loyally _ that it's
his decision to make.
   Bradley still treads cautiously, balancing his work for New
Jersey and his Senate re-election against his broad national aims.
And with that, he maintains distance from the inevitable questions
about 1992.
   But as he moved into his re-election year, Bradley took center
stage at his 11th annual state fund-raiser. Rather than offer brief
remarks while another speaker took the spotlight, he chose to
deliver the main talk himself.
   The lanky former New York Knicks basketball star wove together
personal anecdotes about his past, his political vision for the
future and his love of New Jersey.
   ``My father always wanted me to be a gentleman. And my mother
always wanted me to be a success. Neither one wanted me to be a
politician,'' he said.
   But recalling one hot summer night between his junior and senior
years at Princeton University when he watched the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 passed in Washington, he decided he could help make America
better by serving in the Senate.
   As Bradley continues raising money for an expected $12 million
re-election bid, contributors and supporters continue discussing
his prospects as a presidential contender.
   ``He's probably a stellar senator not only for New Jersey but
for the nation,'' said Robert Menendez, mayor of Union City, N.J.,
which has the nation's second-highest Cuban-American population
outside Miami.
   Menendez credits Bradley for reaching out to that community. The
assemblyman already is thinking about mobilizing traditionally
Republican-leaning Cuban-Americans in New Jersey and Florida behind
Bradley should he enter the presidential arena.
   ``He's the type of candidate that can win for the Democrats
nationally. I think you would see massive crossover,'' Menendez
said. ``I would be willing to use my contacts to promote him.''
   Analyzing the Bradley appeal, Ray Bramucci, head of the
senator's New Jersey re-election operations, said, ``this is a guy
who is a senator who doesn't have jobs to give out. They sense
there's leadership here.''
   Steven Gross, a Newark, N.J., attorney from a 140-member law
firm that raises money for Bradley, said, ``I think he's one of the
most thoughtful politicians this country has developed in this
generation, my generation.''
   Asked about whether Bradley might announce for 1992, he said,
``I think it depends on the state of the economy, if (President)
Bush doesn't handle the deficit.''
   As for holding out until 1996, he said, ``I think there is a
risk of waiting eight years.''
   Bradley's appeal as a senator and politician also lies in being
perceived as a centrist.
   ``He has monopolized most of the middle ground to the right and
the left of him,'' said State Assemblyman Alan Karcher of
Sayreville, N.J.

   Huang Zhen, a former envoy to the United States
who helped plan the historic 1972 visit of President Nixon, died
Sunday in Beijing, the official Xinhua News Agency said. He was 80.
   The news agency did not give the cause of death.
   A native of eastern Anhui province who joined the Red Army in
1931 and the Communist Party in 1932, Huang also was a former
minister of culture and ambassador to France, Hungary and Indonesia.
   At the time of his death he was a member of the Standing
Committee of the Central Advisory Commission, a prestigious body of
retired party elders.
   His official biography said Huang met with former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger to prepare Nixon's February 1972 visit, which
began the process of warmer U.S.-Chinese ties that culminated with
the establishment of full diplomatic relations in 1979.
   From 1973 to 1977, he headed China's liaison office in the
United States. He also served as president of the China-U.S.
People's Friendship Association.
   Huang was ambassador to France from 1964 to 1973, although he
was suspended from his post in 1967-69 while being criticized by
leftist radicals during the Cultural Revolution.
   The Xinhua report did not mention survivors or funeral
arrangements.

<TEXT>
   Gustav Husak, the nation's last
hard-line Communist leader to lose power, plunged Czechoslovakia
into two decades of repression after the failed ``Prague Spring''
reforms of 1968.
   Husak, who resigned Sunday after swearing in a new government
dominated by non-Communists, was picked by the Soviets to take over
the Communist Party leadership from Alexander Dubcek, the architect
of the 1968 reforms crushed by Warsaw Pact tanks.
   Husak replaced Dubcek on April 17, 1969, some eight months after
the Aug. 21, 1968 Soviet-led invasion. His nearly two decades as
party chief were marked by rigid control over the arts and the
harsh suppression of political dissent.
   In his farewell address to the nation Saturday, he alluded to
the current criticism of that 21-year era, allowing that some ``bad
things'' had occurred but sticking fast to his lifelong belief in
the Socialist creed.
   ``Whatever mistakes occurred, were the mistakes of people and
not of fundamental ideas,'' he said, welcoming what he called the
``renaissance'' of Socialism now underway in eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union.
   Husak had been five months away from the end of his third term.
   He was replaced as party leader by Milos Jakes in December 1987,
but retained both his seat on the ruling party Politburo and the
largely ceremonial post of president he had held since 1975.
   Husak, Jakes and the other men responsible for the crackdown on
reform after 1968 all lost their powerful Politburo posts Nov. 24
in a purge prompted by the surging pro-democracy movement.
   During the ``Prague Spring'' liberalization period, Husak
clearly stood for reform, even going so far as to say just days
after the invasion: ``I stand fully behind Dubcek's concept ...
Either I shall stand with him, or I shall leave.''
   But he quickly became a willing executor of the Kremlin's
hardline policy.
   Under continued Soviet pressure, Husak supervised a wholesale
purge of the party and a crackdown that left most of the reform
movement's brightest advocates in official disgrace and toiling in
menial jobs.
   Husak was responsible for sweeping campaigns aimed at crushing
political dissent and the persecution of members of the Charter 77
human rights movement.
   Many of those early disidents, including Czechoslovakia's most
prominent opposition leader, Vaclav Havel, have since forced the
Communists to relinquish their 41-year monopoly on power.
   Opposition leaders had demanded Husak's resignation as a key
step toward genuine democratic reforms.
   Husak was born Jan. 10, 1913, near Bratislava, the Slovak
capital, and trained as a lawyer. He became a Communist Party
member in 1933 and was a leading member of the Communist
underground in Slovakia during World War II.
   He fell into disgrace as a Slovak nationalist during the
Stalinist years. He was arrested in 1951 and later sentenced to
life imprisonment for nationalist and anti-state activities.
   He was released from prison in 1960, given a factory job, and
was later rehabilitated.
   Under Husak, Czechoslovakia gained a reputation as one of the
Soviet Union's most unswerving political allies in the Warsaw Pact.
   His political career became endangered when Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev instituted reforms from the Kremlin, and
neighboring Poland and Hungary followed suit.
   Early in 1987, after Gorbachev outlined a sweeping program of
political change in January that year, Husak switched tactics and
lent verbal support to reforms.
   But that was not enough to save him the party leadership. In the
handover to Jakes, reformers hoped that change would come.
   But Jakes became what Valtr Komarek, a reform-minded economist
tapped as a probable member of the new government, calls a tool of
the ``Mafia'' picked by the Soviets to run Czechoslovakia in 1968,
and in the end appeared even more resistant to change than Husak.

<TEXT>
   The 12-nation European Community,
under pressure to integrate in the face of upheaval to the East,
took dramatic steps on the path toward uniting Europe at a weekend
summit here.
   It remains a rocky and uncertain road, with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher maintaining a lone stance against plans
for economic and monetary integration and community-wide welfare
and workers' rights.
   But the leaders of the wealthy club encompassing 320 million
people emerged from the two-day summit declaring themselves united
in a new role as a single West European bloc committed to reaching
out toward the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.
   ``Henceforth there is no longer a Europe in two parts acting in
the shadows or at the initiative of the two superpowers,'' declared
summit host, French President Francois Mitterrand, winding up the
meeting on Saturday.
   ``Clearly, as of today we can say Yalta belongs more and more to
history,'' he added of the 1945 conference at the end of World War
II that divided the continent of Europe between East and West.
   The rhetoric, at least, echoed a call by President Bush last
week to the European Community to intensify efforts to integrate
and become ``a magnet that draws the forces of reform forward in
Eastern Europe.''
   But from Mitterrand, the most flamboyantly outspoken advocate of
European unity, to Mrs. Thatcher, the often-prickly pragmatist, the
leaders displayed a new political will to act together to encourage
change and guard against anarchy.
   ``Despite disagreements, what emerges most strongly from this
summit is the degree to which the community ... can act as the
driving force for the development of the whole of Europe at a
turning point in the Continent's history,'' Mrs. Thatcher said at a
news conference.
   She reiterated her lone dissent from the decisions to press
ahead with the monetary union and to adopt a ``social charter.''
   But she sounded conciliatory compared with her combative
attitude during past bitter internal disputes over issues ranging
from farm subsidies to whether the community is supposed to be a
trading bloc or an embryonic political federation.
   Mrs. Thatcher's low-key tone also may have been spurred by polls
in Britain showing most voters now disapprove of her tough line in
the community. A Gallup poll published Saturday in London's Daily
Telegraph showed 49 percent of voters questioned disapproved,
compared with 38 percent approval. The rest had no opinion.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who combined with Mitterrand
to override Mrs. Thatcher's objections to the monetary union
conference, went home well-pleased with having secured backing from
the summit for eventual German reunification.
   It is a sensitive issue in a continent that was overrun by
Hitler's Germany in World War II and in peace is dominated by the
powerful economy of West Germany alone.
   Britain apparently raised no objections to a statement of
support for reunification.
   But France, the Netherlands and Italy all expressed reservations.
   The final statement was agreed to only after Kohl spelled out
that by a reunified Germany he meant only the two existing German
nations, East Germany and West Germany, and not German-speaking
areas in neighboring countries.
   ``We seek the strengthening of the state of peace in Europe in
which the German people will regain its unity through free
self-determination,'' the statement said.
   On monetary integration, the community leaders agreed to convene
an intergovernmental conference in December 1990 to start
negotiations on establishing a single currency and one system of
central banks for the 12 countries.
   Mrs. Thatcher said Britain would go along to the negotiations,
which are expected to take several years. But she indicated that
Britain may veto any final attempt to have one currency and the
central bank system.
   She shrugged off being brushed aside on the issue of the
``social charter,'' which is non-binding. ``It is a pity ... but
the outcome is no great tragedy,'' she said.
   The community leaders left Strasbourg committed to intensified
dialogue with the Soviet Union and other reform-minded East
European nations. They also pledged to set up a European
Development Bank to assist new European democracies and held out
the possibility of special trade and other links with them.
   Said Kohl, ``We have made a substantial step forward ... We have
said there is no alternative to the promise of European
unification.''

government of Communist origins is ready to surrender sole power
and form a coalition with opposition parties, but there are no
takers.
   ``I don't blame them,'' Nemeth said, commenting on the refusal
by other parties to share government responsibilities for a
deteriorating economic situation after decades of Communist
mismanagement.
   Nemeth emerged from three-day talks between the government,
opposition parties, trade unions, social organizations and
parliamentary leaders. They were the first in a series meant to
ensure a peaceful transition to multiparty democracy and avert
economic collapse.
   Sunday's talks were restricted to government representatives and
the chairmen of parliamentary committees prior to the December
session of Parliament.
   Interim House Speaker Istvan Fodor told reporters that most
participants agreed on the need to bring parliamentary elections
originally planned for June forward, with Parliament likely
debating a motion for them to be held in March.
   The second most important item of the talks focused on the
economy, and Nemeth said his government took the brunt of
responsibility for unpopular austerity measures.
   But while refusing to share power, ``the other parties have
expressed a willingness to share in the responsibility because they
understand that the government's decisions today will have an
impact on the post-election situation as well,'' Nemeth said.
   Economic belt tightening planned or already in operation
includes an austerity budget, the liquidation of some 50 major
unprofitable enterpises, and the raising of interest rates on
home-purchase loans.
   Nemeth warned over the weekend that unemployment _ officially
non-existent in the 1970s and now at 25,000 _ might double or even
quadruple because of the measures.
   Expressing his support for early elections, Nemeth declared:
``It is in the funadmental interest of the nation to cut the
transition period to the shortest possible.
   ``Let the masked ball end, let us see clearly which party has
what kind of ... support.''
   Nemeth was one of the advocates of terminating the Communist
Party in October and replacing it with the Hungarian Socialist
Party that advocates democratic principles, in preparation for the
country's first free national elections in more than four decades.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Sunday defended President Bush's surprise decision to resume
high-level talks with China six months after Beijing's bloody
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, saying Bush wants to keep
the Chinese in the international community.
   Fighting criticism that the move was a giveaway to the Chinese
government without any improvement in human rights, Baker insisted
China still will be asked to make changes before relations can
return to the way they were before Beijing in June crushed student
protests in and around Tiananmen Square.
   The trip by national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger was to ``seek to improve
the relationship to the extent that could be done,'' Baker said on
ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley'' program.
   ``The president ... deplores the tragedy of Tiananmen Square,''
Baker said. ``But he's of the view that we shouldn't run the risk
of compounding that tragedy by trying to isolate China from the
international community.''
   But the trip, which was not announced in advance, outraged some
in Congress, and the domestic political fallout for Bush appeared
to be growing.
   ``The decision to send these two was clearly designed to send a
powerful symbolic message to the Chinese that the United States was
prepared once again to engage in business as usual with them,''
said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Asia subcommittee.
   ``It reflects once again that the president has been much more
sensitive to the concerns of the Chinese leadership than to the
aspirations of the Chinese people,'' Solarz said.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said through a spokesman that Bush's timing
was poor.
   ``At the very time that freedom is sweeping through Eastern
Europe, we should be sure the United States stands for freedom and
democracy in Asia as well,'' Pell said. ``To my mind, the
administration would have been better advised to wait until basic
human rights were on the way to return in China _ for students, for
Tibetans, for all the people _ before launching such an
initiative.''
   Bush himself declined comment on the trip. After attending a
church service Sunday, he told reporters only that ``We'll have
more to say about that later.''
   At a Chinese students federation in Washington, the mood was
glum.
   ``I feel confused ... shocked and sad,'' said Lian-Chao Han,
vice president of the Independent Federation of Chinese Students
and Scholars. ``The purge is still going on in China and terror is
spread all over China.''
   ``The Chinese government hasn't changed the policy at all, but
Bush is sending high-ranking American officials to Beijing,'' added
the Chinese student activist. ``It really will help the Chinese
government.''
   Scowcroft and Eagleburger flew from Beijing to Tokyo on Sunday
to discuss both the Malta summit and their talks in Beijing with
Japanese officials. The two were expected back in Washington on
Monday afternoon.
   A White House official, speaking only on condition of anonymity,
acknowledged that the decision to send the two officials to China
had been ``closely held.'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said the Chinese had asked that it not be disclosed until Scowcroft
and Eagleburger arrived in Beijing at 1 a.m. EST Saturday.
   Baker said there remains ``a host of differences'' between the
two governments and he noted that trade sanctions against China
remain in place. ``Unless we are willing to talk and try and
resolve these problems, we're not going to be able to preserve this
relationship which is so very important to both countries, and to
move the relationship forward,'' he said.
   He said he had spoken with Scowcroft and Eagleburger after their
meetings and was ``quite confident ... that they were very clear
with the Chinese to raise the human rights concerns that we have.
... We make it clear to the Chinese that they're going to have to
help us if we're going to preserve this relationship and be able to
move it in the direction whence it came.''
   The situation of Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi, who has taken
refuge in the U.S. Embassy since the crackdown, was discussed,
Baker said, but is ``being worked on and worked on very quietly.''
The situation remains a major irritant in U.S.-Chinese relations,
he said.
   The move was a risky one domestically for Bush, who in recent
weeks has vetoed two congressional efforts to turn up the heat on
Beijing: a State Department authorization bill which would have
formalized and slightly expanded U.S. economic sanctions; and a
bill that would have granted automatic visa extensions to Chinese
students in the United States.
   Solarz predicted both measures will be passed quickly again
after Congress returns in January, with heavy support from
Republicans, and said ``effective control of our China policy is
going to be passing to the Congress, inasmuch as the House and
Senate more clearly reflect the will of the American people.''
   But Baker said without efforts to re-establish ties to China an
important relationship could be lost.
   ``We've made it very clear, even in the aftermath of Tiananmen,
that as much as we deplored what happened there this is a very
important relationship in terms of its geopolitical and
geostrategic importance to the United States, and that we wanted to
try and find ways to preserve it,'' he said.
   ``I don't think the American people would want to see their
government compound the tragedy that happened in Tiananmen Square.
And it is our judgment ... that that's what might happen if we seek
to isolate China from the rest of the international community.''

<HEAD>Battleship, On First Persian Gulf Visit, Gets Mixed Welcome</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has replaced its
aircraft carrier force in the Persian Gulf region with a battleship
group, and Iran on Sunday called the new vessel a provocation.
   The change in forces signals a quiet shift in policy, leaving
the region without a carrier and its air-strike capability for the
first time since 1986. However, the battleship made the first visit
ever by a major U.S. warship into the Persian Gulf itself.
   Saudi Arabia has refused to allow the battleship, the USS New
Jersey, to call at an oil center where 8,000 Americans live.
   The 58,000-ton New Jersey, a World War II vintage ship restored
to active duty in recent years, on Saturday received a low-key but
warmer welcome at the island state of Bahrain, which provides
regular shore facilities for U.S. warships based in the region.
   During a one-night stopover, its first of two in the gulf, local
dignitaries were treated to a tour of the 887-foot ship. Most of
its 1,500 crew members went ashore for liberty.
   But even at Bahrain, there was no advance publicity concerning
the first visit ever by a ship of the New Jersey's size. Most
Bahrainis were unaware of the juggernaut anchored about two miles
offshore.
   On Sunday, the ship left for Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.
   The New Jersey, homeported at Long Beach, Calif., arrived this
month to replace the carrier USS Midway, which had patrolled the
Indian Ocean waters just outside the Persian Gulf since September.
   However, U.S. officials said the replacement of the carrier
force did not lessen the American commitment to safeguarding the
strategic oil waterway, where more than 500 commercial vessels were
destroyed or damaged during the eight-year Iraq-Iran war.
   One of the New Jersey's first acts on arrival was its
history-making foray into the gulf, where it was the largest
warship of any nation to sail through the Strait of Hormuz, said a
navy spokesman, Petty Officer Joseph Bartlett.
   During the Iraq-Iran war, U.S. jet carriers and battleships
sometimes entered the outer strait but never the gulf itself. U.S.
officials said such a move would serve no purpose but was sure to
be seen by Iran, and possibly by Arab states, as a provocation.
   Moreover, they said, such ships would be highly vulnerable to
terrorist or close-range military attack in the narrow confines of
the gulf.
   By sending the New Jersey through the Hormuz, U.S. officials
made clear they now consider those risks minimal. There have been
no armed incidents in the gulf since Iraq and Iran agreed to a
cease-fire in August 1988.
   U.S. spokesmen also said the arrival of the battleship was not
related to to the recent successful test-firing of a new strategic
missile by Iraq or with Iranian naval manuevers which by
coincidence began over the weekend.
   Predictably, Iran condemned the New Jersey's arrival as an act
of aggression even in peacetime.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted deputy parliament
speaker Hossein Hashemian as saying the warship's visit ``is aimed
at provocation and heightening tension,'' and ``will not augur well
for the United States.''
   Original plans included a port call at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia,
but Saudi officials, apparently concerned that the high-profile
ship would attract too much attention, rejected the request.
Dhahran, headquarters of the Saudi Arabian-American Oil Co., has
about 8,000 American residents and is often visited by other U.S.
warships in the gulf.
   John Berry, a U.S. embassy press officer in Riyadh, confirmed
that the Saudi government had ``asked that a proposed visit (by the
New Jersey) be deferred,'' but said any further comment would have
to come from Saudi officials. None could be obtained.
   Most gulf Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, balance their
private support for the U.S. military presence in the region with a
public stance of neutrality and rejection of foreign intrusion,
especially by the major powers.
   Naval sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said budget
concerns may have been a factor in replacing the Midway with a less
costly battleship group. Major Olin Saunders, a spokesman at U.S.
Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla., said the last time the
United States lacked a carrier in the Indian Ocean was a five-month
stretch from April to September 1986.

   State Sen. Craig Washington, elected to succeed
the late U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland, said he won't take his new seat
until Texas' Legislature settles the issue of workers' compensation.
   Washington, who defeated City Councilman Anthony Hall in a
non-partisan runoff, also said Saturday night that he would file
Monday for the March Democratic primary to run for a full term.
Leland's term expires at the end of 1990.
   Washington received 24,120 votes, or 56.6 percent, while Hall
garnered 18,473, or 43.4 percent, according to unofficial results.
   Leland, D-Texas, was killed Aug. 7 in a plane crash while on a
famine relief mission over a remote section of Ethiopia.
   Washington, who could move into Leland's old office Monday, said
he will wait until the state decides the hotly debated workers'
compensation issue, which has forced the Legislature into its
second special session.
   Washington, a 17-year veteran of the Legislature, has been a key
Senate supporter of a workers' compensation reform bill favored by
workers and opposed by business.
   Gov. Bill Clements has said that unless the Legislature approves
a plan by Wednesday, he will call an automatic extension, keeping
lawmakers in session through the Christmas holidays.
   Hall and Washington, both Democrats, emerged as the top
vote-getters from a field of 11 candidates in the Nov. 7 special
election.
   The candidates, who are old friends, said Saturday that although
this election seemed to pull them apart, they were anxious for a
new unity in the district.
   ``We will bring this community back together again because we
are one people,'' said Washington, 48.
   Hall, 45, told his campaign workers, ``This is a time for coming
together, a time for healing, a time for commitment to the things
that we said we wanted to go to Congress for.
   ``If we do that in spite of the results tonight, this will
indeed be a victory for us, the people of the 18th Congressional
District,'' Hall said.
   Hall said he is not sure whether he will run for the full term.
   ``I haven't even thought about it,'' he said Saturday. ``I'll
think about it in the next week or so.''
   Washington and Hall had been political allies of Leland for many
years. In 1972, the three successfully ran for the state House of
Representatives on a slate of five black Houstonians. The other two
candidates were unsuccessful.
   Hall served in the House until 1978, then took on Leland in a
bitter battle to succeed U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan in the 18th
District. The next year, Hall was elected to the City Council. He
gave up that seat to seek the congressional post.

   Local officials feared they would get the
usual ho-hum response to a survey on how the town should react to
growth, so they added a little incentive _ a shot at winning $250.
   It's working.
   As one of Maine's fastest-growing communities, Raymond was
required by state law to adopt a comprehensive plan by 1991. The
population of the town in southern Maine has increased 66 percent
since 1980 to 3,500 as it develops into a bedroom community for
Portland.
   Local officials decided to solicit residents' opinions on such
issues as which areas should be targeted as growth zones and what
they wanted the town to be like in a decade.
   However, town officials had had little luck with surveys. When
they tried to find out how people felt about the town getting its
own police department, only 45 residents responded.
   And officials acknowledged that the latest questionnaire is
complex and lengthy, and takes about an hour to complete.
   Someone suggested a lottery to get people's attention.
   ``At first we thought this was kind of tacky _ like an insult to
have a drawing for money, when out of the goodness of their hearts
and civic duty people should respond,'' said Chairwoman Jackie
Hewitt of the Raymond Planning Committee.
   ``But we knew that in the past this hadn't worked. So we decided
to try a lottery,'' she said.
   Questionnaires, with lottery tickets stapled on, were sent out
in November. Residents were asked to complete and return the forms,
with half of the lottery ticket attached. The winning ticket is to
be picked in January.
   Forms are still being accepted, but the response rate is already
26 percent.
   Committee members chose the $250 figure because they figured it
would be large enough to attract attention, ``but small enough to
not lead to lying and cheating and stealing,'' said Town Manager
Martin Krauter.
   And by asking residents to pay their own postage to return the
survey, the town is saving $250.
   Not good enough, say critics.
   ``I'd say $250 doesn't do much for people these days,'' said Jim
Phoenix, owner of Tommy's Sandwich Shop. ``If they'd have made it
$1,000, they'd have gotten a lot more responses.''

   Thousands of grieving men and women filed by a
row of white coffins Sunday, paying respects to the 14 women killed
by a gunman shouting ``I hate feminists'' during Canada's worst
mass murder.
   The flower-draped coffins of eight of the victims were placed in
the University of Montreal's hall of honor, and mourners passed by
quietly in single file.
   ``It's a shame that such a thing could happen in this world,''
said Yvon Lechance, a phone company manager. He said he and his
family, including two university students, were there as ``part of
the human family.''
   A funeral service for nine of the victims will be held Monday
morning at the Notre Dame cathedral. The other families scheduled
private ceremonies.
   Police said Marc Lepine, 25, burst into the University of
Montreal's engineering school Wednesday and shot at women he
encountered before killing himself with his semi-automatic rifle.
   He also wounded nine women and four men.
   Many of the mourners Sunday were university students, but there
also were hundreds of older people. The University of Montreal is
the largest in the province of Quebec with about 50,000 students.
   The line of mourners extended around the building as about 900
people passed by the coffins each hour. Others were still waiting
in line at dusk as snow started falling.
   Martine Leprince, a professor of English at Concordia
University, said she was there ``because I teach. I keep seeing
that classroom and the man coming in. I feel as if I was there
myself or my daughter was there.''
   Witnesses of Wednesday's terrible rampage said Lepine shouted,
``I want the women!'' and ``You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate
feminists!'' as he opened fire after separating the men from the
women in one classroom where six women were killed.
   The Montreal Gazette on Sunday quoted an unidentified police
officer as saying one of the victims was stabbed to death during
the massacre, and the others were shot.
   It said the stabbing victim was Maryse Leclair, whose father,
police public relations director Pierre Leclair, found her dead
when he went to the scene.
   Police said earlier the killer had a hunting knife and a rifle
that he purchased Nov. 21 at a local sport shop.
   A suicide letter found on Lepine's body blamed women for much of
his unhappiness, police said. They also said Lepine had taken
courses apparently with the hope of entering the engineering
school. No record has been found that he ever applied.

   Snow in the northern Plains and ice storms in North Carolina and
Georgia, blamed for at least nine deaths over the weekend,
threatened other states Sunday in the path of storms and chilling
winds.
   Heavy snow hampered traffic and caused delays at Denver's
Stapleton International Airport on Sunday, and caused a dozen-car
pileup on Interstate 25 near Johnstown that blocked traffic for two
hours. A motorist's death in Colorado Springs was blamed on the
storm.
   In addition to Colorado, snow showers fell over western New York
state, much of Ohio, Upper Michigan, northern Lower Michigan, Iowa,
southern Minnesota, the Dakotas, eastern Nebraska and the Nebraska
Panhandle, western Kansas, New Mexico and Montana.
   In North Carolina, the first wintry storm of the season was
responsible for three deaths Friday and four Saturday, authorities
said. The storm also knocked out power to thousands of households
and toppled two television towers before moving out to sea Sunday.
   ``This is one of the most severe storms we have had,'' said
North Carolina Power spokesman Randy Shillingburg. ``In some areas
... in Roanoke Rapids there are probably three, possibly four
inches of ice.''
   The northeast Georgia mountains were blanketed with 3 to 4
inches of snow Saturday, but on Sunday temperatures rose into the
40s under sunny skies.
   A motorist's death in Georgia on Saturday was blamed on road ice.
   Snowfall overnight measured 11 inches at Winner, S.D., 6 inches
at Pickstown, S.D., 3 to 6 inches over northwest Iowa, 5 inches at
Newcastle, Neb., and Yankton, S.D., 4 inches at Laurel and
Bloomfield, Neb., and 3 inches at Rapid City S.D., and over upper
Michigan.
   Four inches of snow fell on Denver during the morning, 2 inches
fell at Colorado Springs and Limon, Colo., and one inch fell at
Billings and Great Falls, Mont., and Pueblo, Colo.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 21 degrees below
zero at Houlton, Maine.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 2
degrees below zero at Cutbank, Mont., to 82 degrees at San Angelo,
Texas.

   Chinese dissidents criticized the Bush
administration Sunday for resuming high-level talks with China six
months after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, saying
there can be no compromise on human rights.
   ``I think being a president, he should have a good memory,''
said Wu'er Kaixi, the student leader who fled China after the
bloody events of June in Tiananmen Square.
   ``We are seeing the fact that there is a split between Congress
and the Bush administration on the issue,'' Yan Jiaqi, chairman of
the Front for a Democratic China, said through an interpreter.
``When we talk about politics, we believe a compromise can be made,
but on the question of human rights we don't believe a compromise
can be made.''
   The dissidents spoke at the end of a five-day conference on the
future of their pro-democracy movement. Responding to complaints
that their efforts were disorganized, the leaders took 16 steps to
improve the FDC's internal workings, including the structure of
committees and budgeting, Yan said.
   The dissidents spent eight of their 60 hours of talks discussing
complaints about Wu'er, the most widely known of the group, and
issued him a warning for making unauthorized comments to the media.
   The conference ended as National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger left
Beijing after meeting with top Chinese officials. Scowcroft and
Eagleburger are the first senior U.S. officials to visit China
since Bush imposed sanctions after the attack on Chinese students
last June.
   Several leading members of Congress criticized the timing of the
U.S. move.
   ``At the very time that freedom is sweeping through Eastern
Europe, we should be sure the United States stands for freedom and
democracy in Asia as well,'' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said through a spokesman.
   Bush recently vetoed a congressional bill that would have
allowed Chinese students to remain in the United States
indefinitely. The administration said it would grant extensions as
needed at the administrative level.
   Yan praised actions and statements by Congress following the
crackdown.
   ``Since America is a democratic country, the Bush administration
should respect the will of the people and the will of Congress,''
he said.
   The disappointment with the administration was echoed in
Washington.
   ``The Chinese government hasn't changed the policy at all, but
Bush is sending high-ranking American officials to Beijing,'' said
Lian-Chao Han, vice president of the Independent Federation of
Chinese Students and Scholars. ``It really will help the Chinese
government.''
   The pro-democracy leaders opened their Massachusetts conference
to criticism from the Chinese-American community that they are
disorganized. The dissidents said the steps taken at the conference
would improve their organization.
   The conference also agreed to send a team of members to Taiwan
and praised the progress toward democracy made there. The ruling
Nationalist Party last week suffered a sharp setback in Taiwan's
first multiparty elections, losing key local posts and seeing its
share of the vote fall to 58 percent from 70 percent three years
ago.
   Yong-Chuan Liu, head of an independent asssociation of students
in the United States who had been critical of the FDC, praised the
work of the conference.
   ``I feel very very comfortable that the FDC is making
progress,'' he said.
   Wu'er, best known for his face-to-face confrontation with
Chinese leaders during the pro-democracy uprising and now studying
at Harvard University, was issued a warning by the group for
unspecified comments in the media.
   Asked about the warning, Wu'er said, ``I made some mistakes of
course,'' but pressed to elaborate he added, ``I don't know very
clearly.''
   FDC leaders said the warning covered statements Wu'er made that
appeared to represent the group but in fact did not. They did not
elaborate.

   Negotiations between the government and
militant Moslems holding a Cabinet minister's daughter appeared
deadlocked Sunday after the abductors demanded the release of two
more jailed colleagues, officials said.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
talks were continuing but a solution seemed difficult to reach.
They said the kidnappers were now demanding the release of seven
jailed colleagues in exchange for freeing Rubaiya Sayeed, the
daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed.
   Earlier, the group had demanded the release of only five
militants.
   The officials said two local journalists and two paroled
militants were holding talks on behalf of the government with the
Kashmir Liberation Front, the militant group that claimed
responsibility for Friday's kidnapping in the city of Srinagar.
   Formed in 1965, the front is demanding that northern
Jammu-Kashmir state either become independent or part of Moslem
Pakistan.
   The front has threatened in a statement released to newspapers
to kill Ms. Sayeed if the jailed militants are not released by 7
p.m. (8:30 a.m. EST) Monday.
   They also threatened to kidnap relatives of police officers if
the demands were not met.
   A police source said commandos of the paramilitary National
Security Guard had identified the place where the group was holding
Ms. Sayeed. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did
not reveal the location but said the commandos had surrounded the
area.
   Chief Secretary Moosa Raza, the state's top bureaucrat, said the
government hoped the crisis could be resolved through talks. But he
added: ``If necessary, we will take other drastic actions.'' He did
not elaborate but apparently was referring to a military operation.
   On Saturday, elite commandos were flown into the area and told
to stand by. Ms. Sayeed, a 22-year-old intern at a hospital in
Srinagar, was abducted on her way home from work, authorities said.
   Among the prisoners that the front wants released is Abdul Hamid
Sheikh, a top leader in the organization. Sheikh was arrested last
month after being wounded in a clash with police. He is in a
Srinagar hospital.
   All the prisoners have been arrested within the past year and
are suspected of subversive activities, but charges have yet to be
filed.
   Sayeed, the country's first Moslem home minister, was appointed
last week by Prime Minister V.P. Singh, a Hindu. The home minister
is in charge of police and internal security.
   The government on Sunday issued a statement saying the abduction
was an attempt to derail renewed efforts to restore the country's
secular foundation.
   The kidnapping came a day after Sayeed was appointed to lead a
government committee to try to end separatist campaigns in
Jammu-Kashmir and neighboring Punjab, where Sikh militants are
demanding an independent nation.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in officially secular,
predominantly Hindu India with a Moslem majority.
   Kashmir is claimed both by India and Pakistan, and the two
countries have fought three wars over the territory since they
gained independence from Britain in 1947.

   North Carolina's first wintry storm of the
season killed seven motorists, knocked out power to thousands of
households, and toppled two television towers before moving out to
sea Sunday.
   Towers for WPTF-TV and WRAL-TV, both Raleigh stations, collapsed
Sunday within a half-hour of each other, spokesmen for the stations
said. The towers stand side-by-side in Auburn just south of Raleigh.
   Witnesses said it appeared that melting ice destabilized the
structures. WPTF estimated the damage to its 2,000-foot tower at $6
million and said it could be weeks before the station would be
broadcasting at full power.
   ``I heard something. It sounded like ice...and ... I saw it
folding up just like an accordion or folding ladder,'' said Sue
Williams, a resident who lives near the towers.
   Adjacent to the two, a tower for WTVD-TV of Durham was left
leaning to one side under the weight of the ice.
   The storm blew in Friday, dumping several inches of snow in the
state's northern mountains, and began crawling across North
Carolina, spitting sleet and glazing roads with ice.
   The ice wreaked havoc on the state's electrical lines, which
broke under the weight of ice and falling tree limbs.
   ``This is one of the most severe storms we have had. In some
areas ... in Roanoke Rapids there are probably three, possibly four
inches of ice. It's not snow. It's ice,'' said North Carolina Power
spokesman Randy Shillingburg.
   Shillingburg said 9,500 of the utility's 90,000 customers
remained without electricity Sunday, most of them in the
Williamston and Ahoskie areas, and in rural areas adjacent to
Roanoke Rapids.
   Some households and businesses had been without light or heat
nearly 24 hours, he said.
   Duke Power Co. said 10,000 Charlotte-area customers were
temporarily without power.
   Carolina Power and Light Co. spokesman Wayne Ennis said 3,600 of
the utility's customers remained without electricity Sunday
morning, mostly in the Fayetteville, Henderson and Warrenton areas.
   Utility officials said ice is more troublesome than snow.
   ``We've got dozens of strands of wire down, hundreds of trees
and tree limbs. You could liken the damage as a result of an ice
storm to more like a hurricane or tornado than anything else,''
Shillingburg said.
   Police across the state reported hundreds of traffic accidents,
at least seven of them fatal, as cars slid on streets that
resembled ice-skating rinks. Four motorists were killd Saturday and
three Friday.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators on Sunday
demanded more democratic reform in East Germany, and a state-run
union called for an end to a 40-year-old policy that forbids
strikes.
   Gregor Gysi, East Germany's new Communist Party chief, said he
wants a clear separation of party and government functions, a
radical concept in a country where the party has been all-powerful
for 40 years.
   In another development, the four World War II Allies _ France,
Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union _ announced they
would meet Monday to discuss the role of Berlin in East-West
affairs.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans took to the streets in
demonstrations in Rostock, Erfurt and six other cities, the
official news agency ADN said. The protesters were demanding
democratic reforms and respect for human rights, the agency said.
   In the southern city of Plauen, about 15,000 demonstrators
turned out for a pro-democracy rally called by the New Forum
opposition group.
   Several hundred people in East Berlin demonstrated for human
rights and against what they see as growing intolerance of
foreigners.
   Hartmut Krausse, a member of New Forum, told 15,000 people in
the southern city of Ilmenau that talk of ``anarchy, chaos and
violence'' was out of place.
   ``Rather, we should be talking about democratic reform on the
basis of new elections,'' Krausse told the cheering crowd.
   In the face of such protests, the Communist Party has ousted its
hard-line leaders, lifted travel restrictions, opened the Berlin
Wall and abandoned its constitutionally guaranteed hold on power _
all in the last three months.
   Leaders of the 160,000-member scientists' union, meeting on
Saturday in Leipzig, issued the call for recognition of the right
to strike, ADN said.
   The scientists' union is one of 16 unions belonging to the
state-run labor federation Freier Deutsche Gewerskschaftsbund.
   The scientists' call amounts to a demand for the federation
leadership to recognize the right to strike embodied in the East
German Constitution.
   Since 1949, the 8.6-million member federation has rejected the
right to strike, arguing that since the nation's businesses are
``owned by the people,'' any strike would be against the people
themselves.
   The federation has been rocked by a growing financial scandal,
and a new leadership took over Saturday to make it more independent.
   The prospect of strikes clearly alarmed Gysi, 41, who took over
as party chief only on Saturday. In an interview broadcast late
Saturday night on West Germany's ADR television network, he said
that given the country's current political instability strikes
would be ``irresponsible.''
   Gysi spent Sunday preparing for next weekend's continuation of
the emergency party congress that is expected to give the party a
new name.
   Late Sunday, the official news agency ADN said Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev had sent Gysi a message of congratulations
that also emphasized the ``sovereign'' nature of East Germany.
Gorbachev, whose Soviet reform movement prompted the pro-democracy
revolution in the East bloc, recently joined with East German
leaders in rejecting German reunification, a possibility that has
been debated since the reform movement began transforming East
Germany.
   East Germany faces its first free elections in May, and party
leaders have said they would be happy to receive 20 percent of the
vote.
   In the interview, Gysi said he was urging a ``strict division of
party and government.'' But he added, ``This can't be done in one
day. It is a long-term job that is being taken very seriously.''
   Such separation would be a striking change in East Germany
where, despite recent democratic reforms, party members still hold
most of the important positions in the country.
   The government already has begun stripping some of the
Communists' influence. For example, it disarmed the party's private
militia that had been based in the nation's factories. But the
government would have to assert itself much more to be considered
an equal player with the Communist Party.
   The Communists also say they see themselves as one party among
several political forces in East Germany, following two months of
upheaval that started with the downfall of hard-line ruler Erich
Honecker.
   Last week, reformist Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer of Dresden said
the nation's factories have been hit by politically motivated
warning strikes, aimed against Communist Party interference.
Berghofer said the unrest could get out of hand and escalate into
violence.
   On Sunday, he warned that trouble could come from both the
extreme right and the extreme left in East Germany. ``Violence has
not been dispelled,'' he told reporters. ``An escalation is
possible at any moment.''
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in a speech
Sunday in Saarbruecken, urged East Germans to maintain their
``responsibility and restraint.'' He said, ``Keep your protests and
efforts violence-free.''
   There have been increasing reports of tensions in East Germany,
as many people joined the hunt to root out corruption, especially
among the ousted and disgraced members of the Communist Party.

<TEXT>
   The World War II Allies _ France, Britain,
the United States and the Soviet Union _ will hold a major
conference Monday to discuss the role of divided Berlin in
East-West affairs.
   It will be the first such Four Power conference since the 1971
meeting that drew up an agreement on the Allies' rights in the city.
   A joint statement issued Sunday said ambassadors from the four
nations will discuss what the United States calls the ``Berlin
initiative.''
   It said the Soviet government informed the three Western Allies
on Friday that Moscow was ``prepared to discuss this initiative.''
   The initiative, outlined by then-President Ronald Reagan during
a visit to West Berlin in 1987, calls for making Berlin a center
for international conferences and youth exchanges. It also suggests
improving air traffic to the city and that Berlin be considered as
the site for Olympic Games.
   London's Sunday Telegraph said, ``The convening of the
conference ... is a direct result of Mrs. (Prime Minister Margaret)
Thatcher's `go-slow' policy on the possible reunification of
Germany.''
   ``The Four Powers meeting is seen by British officials as
another way to put a necessary brake on the moves towards
reunification,'' it added.
   But Allied sources, speaking to The Associated Press on the
condition of anonymity, discounted the report without elaborating.
They said the conference would be held at the Allied headquarters
building in West Berlin.
   West Germany's ZDF television network said the future of Berlin
as well as East and West Germany probably would be discussed.
   ``Apparently, neither the West German government nor the West
Berlin government was notified in advance,'' it said. ``The
assertion that air traffic is likely to be the main point of
discussions is hardly believable.''
   ZDF said one reason for the meeting ``probably is the fear that
the coming together of the two German states could get out of
control and the status quo in Europe change overnight.''
   Berlin has become the center of intense speculation following
East Germany's Nov. 9 decision to let its citizens travel freely to
the West. West Berlin leaders said that action calls for a revision
of the city's role.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was scheduled to arrive in
West Berlin late Monday, but it was not known here if his visit was
linked to the conference.
   In the 1971 Four Power pact, the Soviets agreed to allow
unhindered air, rail and automobile traffic between West Germany
and West Berlin. The agreement also cleared the way for closer ties
between West Berlin and West Germany and spelled out the rights of
the four Allies.
   Berlin is 100 miles inside East German territory.
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper has said the crush of visitors
and resettlers from East Germany has overwhelmed the city
government.
   Pro-democracy reforms in East Germany have caused political
upheaval that some people fear could lead to violence.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in a speech
Sunday in Saarbruecken, called on East Germans to maintain their
``responsibility and restraint.''
   In the East German city of Dresden, Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer
said trouble could come from both the extreme right and extreme
left.``Violence has not been dispelled,'' he told reporters. ``An
escalation is possible at any moment.''

<HEAD>Woman Gives Away Thousands in Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christmas came early at a motel bar near Midway
Airport when a well-dressed woman walked in, wished everyone a
happy holiday and started passing out $100, $50 and $20 bills to
patrons.
   Judy Kelly, of Boston, said she was driving across the country
competing against 40 or 50 other people in a national ``treasure
hunt'' that required her to give money away, according to a truck
driver at the bar who asked to remain anonymous.
   But the generosity seemed suspicious to tavern owners, who
called police. Officers questioned the woman and took her to a
local mental health center for an evaluation but did not arrest
her, police said.
   ``You might call her eccentric,'' said Tom Tandaric, one of the
officers who questioned the woman.
   Ms. Kelly stopped Saturday afternoon at the Carlton Midway Motor
Lounge on the city's southwest side, walked in and promptly passed
out three $100 bills to three Midway Airlines employees sitting at
a table, witnesses said.
   ``Merry Christmas,'' she said to the confused trio.
   She pulled the cash from a brown paper bag in her purse. When
she ran out of $100 bills, she apologized and gave out 50s. When
she ran out of those, she apologized and gave out 20s.
   By one estimate she gave away $5,000, the Chicago Sun-Times
reported in Sunday editions.
   ``The bills just have pictures of dead men,'' the newspaper
quoted Ms. Kelly as saying. ``Everybody left in better spirits.''
   The bar filled as word spread. Waitresses called friends and
flight attendants from nearby Midway Airport rushed back to tell
co-workers.
   All tried politely to make the acquaintance of Ms. Kelly, who
appeared to be in her mid-50s.
   ``They were all coming up and playing stupid like they didn't
know what was going on,'' said Jose Gallegos, 21, an employee of a
neighboring rental car agency who had to give Ms. Kelly a kiss in
return for his $100.
   Ms. Kelly gave $100 to the truck driver and another $50 to his
dog. She gave $100 to a young woman with two children, and when she
heard the woman wanted to leave an abusive boyfriend, she added
another $400.
   Police arrived when Ms. Kelly was down to $10 bills. They
escorted her into a back room and asked why she was passing out
money.
   ``Just to do it,'' she replied.
   When one officer advised her to save a few dollars for a rainy
day, she replied that she had a substantial bankbook and could wire
for more.
   At the local police station, Officer Burleigh Ginkel said Sunday
that police did not arrest the woman. ``It's not against the law to
give money away,'' he said.
   However, another officer at the station, who would not give his
name, said police took Ms. Kelly to the Bobby Wright Comprehensive
Community Mental Health Center.
   A man who identified himself as an evaluator at the mental
health center said Ms. Kelly was brought in by the police and
evaluated Saturday night. The man refused to give his name or
comment on the result of the evaluation. He said the woman left
with police.
   Both officers at the local station said they did not have a
report on the incident and did not have any knowledge of a national
giveaway competition. They said the officers who questioned the
woman Saturday would not be on duty until late Sunday.
   Sally Mascorro, a front desk clerk at the motel, said Ms. Kelly
checked out early Sunday morning but her car was still in the
parking lot.
   Although it was unclear what happened to the woman, she left
behind some good cheer.
   ``It's like `Miracle on 34th Street,''' waitress Maria Cross,
said referring to the classic movie starring Natalie Wood. ``It
feels real good.''

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle on Sunday called on
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to help repeal a United Nations
resolution equating Zionism with racism.
   The vice president challenged Gorbachev to prove he wants the
United Nations to play a stronger role in world affairs by
replacing the General Assembly resolution of 1975 with a new one.
   ``This resolution would state that Zionism is not and never has
been a form of racism,'' Quayle said in a speech at a Yeshiva
University dinner, where he received an honorary doctor of laws
degree.
   Zionism, the movement to re-establish and support a Jewish
national state in the biblical homeland of Israel, is opposed by
Israel's Arab neighbors and their allies.
   The vice president welcomed the move away from anti-Zionist
propaganda in the ``new thinking'' in the Soviet Union, which was
instrumental in passing the 1975 resolution.
   Quayle said he will discuss repealing the resolution in a
meeting scheduled for Monday with U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar. He said he also plans to hand the
secretary-general a $65 million check for current U.S. obligations
to the world body.

   A West Point swimming champion who is
studying Chinese and plans a career in military intelligence was
one of 32 Americans named Rhodes Scholars, the Rhodes Scholarship
Trust announced Sunday.
   The winners of the prestigious scholarship, who receive two
years of study at Oxford University in England, were chosen in
nationwide meetings Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The trust is
based at Pomona College in Claremont.
   Yale and Princeton each had four scholars, Harvard had three,
and Georgetown, Kansas State University and the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point, N.Y., each had two.
   This year's list contains 18 men and 14 women. Women have been
eligible for the scholarship since 1976, and so far 154 have won it.
   Martina Vandenberg, a 21-year-old International Relations major
at Pomona College, said she was the last candidate interviewed
Saturday and thought it was ``a lost cause'' when she was not among
four students called back for further interviews. An hour later she
learned she had won the scholarship.
   In Grand Forks, N.D., Mary Ellen Preston said she was
``absolutely thrilled'' her son, Mark Sommerville, 22, had won a
scholarship. ``It's a marvelous opportunity,'' she said.
Sommerville is studying electrical engineering and fine arts in a
dual-degree program at the University of Texas at Austin.
   The list of scholars has references to 25 states. But the
candidate-provided address often is a residence for the academic
year and does not necessarily reflect the home state of the Rhodes
scholar.
   Among the qualities sought in Rhodes scholars are proven
intellectual and academic excellence, integrity, respect for
others, and the ability to lead and to use talents fully.
   One of the two West Point recipients, Jennie Koch, who gives a
Potomac, Md., address, will be cadet captain on the brigade
commander's staff next semester. She ranks fifth in her class as an
international relations major, and is considering a career in
public service with an emphasis on foreign policy.
   Also from West Point is Carolyn A. Ford of Pensacola, Fla., who
was appointed to the academy through the enlisted ranks. A foreign
language specialist in Chinese, she also is a brigade swimming
champion and graduate of the Airborne School, and is a battalion
commander. She plans a career in military intelligence.
   Former Rhodes scholars include Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
entertainer Kris Kristofferson, former Los Angeles Rams quarterback
Pat Haden and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Byron White.
   Athletic prowess is one of the measures sought as proof of
talent, although participation in varsity sports is not essential.
   Yale University's Tanya Pollard hikes and backpacks, while S.
Kim Grose of Stanford is skipper of the Stanford University varsity
sailing team, which took first place in the 1989 Women's Fall
Championships.
   Scholarship winners have college and university fees paid and
receive a stipend to cover living expenses.
   The Rhodes scholarships were established in 1902 by the estate
of Cecil Rhodes, a British philanthropist and colonialist. Rhodes
had hoped the scholarships would contribute to world understanding
and peace.
   There were 102 finalists from eight regional districts this
year, said David Alexander, American secretary of the Rhodes
Scholarship Trust and president of Pomona College.
   The scholarships have gone to 2,564 American students since the
program started. Scholars also are chosen from 17 other countries.
   Recipients must be between the ages of 18 and 24 and be
unmarried.

   Texas Republican Party leaders voted

   Members of the State Republican Executive Committee voted 40-16
Saturday to reject a proposal to ask GOP primary voters whether
they ``agree with the most recent Supreme Court decision that the
state has an interest in the protection of potential human life.''
   The committee also softened the party's stance on the movement
to have English declared the state's official language, saying the
effort has ``increased hostilities among ethnic groups.''
   In a resolution, the GOP body said it reaffirms its
``conviction'' that official business should be conducted in
English but ``does not and has not endorsed any English
Only@English First Movement.''
   In a non-binding referendum on the 1988 GOP ballot, 92 percent

   A government controlled by
non-Communists took power Sunday for the first time in 41 years,
and tens of thousands of people jammed the nation's streets to
celebrate the historic victories of their peaceful revolution.
   President Gustav Husak, the nation's last old-guard Communist
leader, resigned after swearing in the new government, which
includes two men who were persecuted as dissidents until just two
weeks ago.
   In a key compromise, the Interior Ministry, which runs the
nation's hated secret and uniformed police, will be run by a
leading dissident, the new Communist premier and a Communist Party
member proposed by the opposition.
   The new 21-member government contains 10 Communists, two of whom
enjoy opposition support, seven non-party members and two members
each from the small Socialist and People's parties, which recently
broke ties with the Communists.
   More than 100,000 people crammed Prague's Wenceslas Square to
hear opposition leader Vaclav Havel, 53, and other dissidents who
battled jail and harassment for 13 years catalogue the successes of
their fight for democracy.
   The embattled Communists have granted stunning concessions,
including the opening of borders, the promise of free elections and
the elimination of their monopoly on power.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe Sunday:
   _ More than 50,000 people chanting ``Democracy!'' rallied in
Sofia, Bulgaria, in the biggest demonstration for reform since the
Communists consolidated power there 43 years ago.
   _ Tens of thousands of East Germans rallied in several cities in
support of further democratic reforms. The new East German
Communist Party chief said he wants a clear separation of party and
government functions.
   _ Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned Communist Party
leaders in Moscow that their colleagues' fall from power in Eastern
Europe proves they must quickly solve Soviet domestic problems or
face similar ``excesses.''
   Czechoslovakia's Parliament meets Tuesday to pick Husak's
successor, and both Havel and Alexander Dubcek, 68, the popular
leader of the crushed 1968 reform movement, have said they would
accept the post if nominated.
   ``We haven't won yet,'' Havel told the cheering crowd in a
nationally televised speech. ``But it is a great success, giving us
great hope. This is a success for all of us, both our nations.
Without this spontaneous awakening, this success would not have
been achieved.''
   ``This peaceful revolution was ... against violence, dirt,
mafias, privileges, persecutions,'' Havel said. ``Let us preserve
its purity, peacefulness, love and merry, friendly flair.''
   ``The years-long, deadly silence of a humiliated people has been
drowned out by a multi-voiced popular choir,'' he said.
   Referring to the police crackdown on students Nov. 17 that
energized the nation's pro-democracy movement, he said: ``After an
artificial halt, history began moving with breathtaking speed which
surprised all of us. One day, historians will study this and tell
us what happened.''
   The crowd burst into applause and cheers as Havel listed the
achievements of the Civic Forum opposition movement, and its Slovak
counterpart, Public Against Violence, which were formed only on
Nov. 19.
   One hour earlier, Husak, the man responsible for the 21 years of
repression and stagnation that followed the Warsaw Pact invasion
that crushed the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms, swore in the new
``government of national understanding'' the opposition had
demanded.
   The 76-year-old, hard-line leader _ who ended up conducting the
ceremony on International Human Rights Day _ then resigned as he
had promised to do.
   The government he installed includes men he jailed or stripped
of all but the most menial jobs when he was Communist Party chief
from 1969 to 1987.
   The new Cabinet ministers includes Jiri Dienstbier, who was
jailed with Havel from 1979 to 1982 for battling for human rights,
and Jan Carnogursky, a Slovak lawyer and Roman Catholic activist
freed from jail only two weeks ago. Dienstbier became foreign
minister and Carnogursky a first vice premier.
   Gen. Miroslav Vacek, a Communist, remained defense minister, but
the Interior Ministry will be run by the new premier, Marian Calfa;
First Vice Premier Valtr Komarek, a Communist Party member proposed
by the opposition; and Carnogursky.
   Parliament, which meets Tuesday, has two weeks to choose a new
president.
   If the premier remains Calfa, a Slovak, the new president should
be a Czech, according to tradition. But Calfa, who is viewed as a
weak caretaker premier, said it had not yet been decided who would
be president and that if a Slovak was chosen, a Czech would become
premier.
   He told a news conference that a prime objective of the new
government was to pave the way for new elections, which he said
could be held by July.
   The opposition backs Havel to take over, arguing that he is an
untainted symbol of national unity. The 100,000 people cramming
Wenceslas Square on Sunday also expressed support for the
internationally renowned playwright.
   Havel sounded presidential when he addressed the crowd Sunday.
He recalled the unanimous parliamentary vote Nov. 29 that stripped
the Communist Party of its constitutionally guaranteed hold on
power.
   Five days earlier, then-Communist Party chief Milos Jakes and
all the other hard-liners responsible for the post-1968 crackdown
lost their seats on the ruling Politburo. Later they gave up all
their other positions of power.
   The opposition suffered a brief setback on Dec. 3, when
then-Communist Premier Ladislav Adamec named a 21-man Cabinet that
contained only five non-Communists and left his party dominating
all key ministries.
   Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets the next day
to back an opposition call for a general strike if a new Cabinet
was not named by Sunday.
   That strike was called off during Sunday's rally on Wenceslas
Square.
   Other rallies celebrating the Czechoslovaks' proud achievement
took place around the country, state-run media reported.

   Actress Candice Bergen and young
actor Fred Savage received Golden Apple Awards from the Hollywood
Women's Press Club, which presented a Sour Apple to
actress-comedian Roseanne Barr.
   Angela Lansbury received the organization's Louella O. Parsons
Award, named after its founder. The 49th annual Golden Apple awards
were given out at a banquet Saturday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
   The award to Miss Lansbury, who stars in the ``Murder, She
Wrote'' television series, goes to ``the individual who presents
the best image of the entertainment industry to the world.''
   The Sour Apple token is deposited into the hands of ``the
individual deemed the least newsworthy and-or most taken with his
or her own publicity.''
   It was a fast turnaround for Miss Barr, who just last year won a
Golden Apple as female discovery of the year as her ``Roseanne''
television show became a hit.
   Miss Bergen, the star of TV's ``Murphy Brown,'' won her Golden
Apple as female star of the year. Male star of the year went to
comedian-actor Billy Crystal, star of the movie ``When Harry Met
Sally ...''
   Savage, the teen-age star of ``The Wonder Years'' won male
discovery of the year.
   There was a tie for female discovery of the year honors, with
awards to both Pauline Collins, star of the movie ``Shirley
Valentine,'' and Meg Ryan, who starred with Crystal in ``When Harry
Met Sally ...''
   The Hollywood Women's Press Club was founded by Miss Parsons, a
columnist, in 1928. It started handing out the golden apple 12
years later.

   Chanting abortion-rights and AIDS activists lay
down in the aisles of St. Patrick's Cathedral Sunday, forcing
Cardinal John J. O'Connor to interrupt his sermon while police
carried protesters out on stretchers.
   More than 4,500 demonstrators marched outside, along a stretch
of Fifth Avenue normally crowded with shoppers and sightseers,
chanting ``Teach safe sex'' and ``Just say no is not enough.''
   Police said 111 people were arrested.
   Gay activists have staged a variety of actions at St. Patrick's
since 1987, when O'Connor barred a gay Roman Catholic group,
Dignity, from using church facilities for meetings.
   Church officials, anticipating the well-publicized
demonstration, took the unusual step of clearing the church after
the 9 a.m. Mass, then searching the bags of everyone entering for
the 10:15 a.m. Mass.
   The cathedral doors were locked a few minutes after Mass
started, said archdiocese spokesman Joe Zwilling. Police were
stationed all around the massive cathedral, including at the rail
in front of the altar.
   Police said 43 people were arrested inside the packed cathedral
when they jumped from their seats near the start of O'Connor's
homily and stretched out in the center aisle, some chaining
themselves to pews.
   O'Connor was forced to distribute copies of his sermon rather
than read it, and he asked the congregation to stand and join him
in reciting prayers to drown out protesters' chants.
   He continued the Mass while dozens of uniformed and plainclothes
police walked up and down the aisle, ferrying the protesters out on
bright orange stretchers.
   Police Sgt. Peter Sweeney said 68 were arrested outside, where
protesters marched with signs such as ``Curb Your Dogma'' and
``Pope John Paul for Ayatollah.''
   In 1988, two months after 11 silent protesters were arrested
inside the cathedral, a state judge issued an injunction barring
demonstrations inside.
   Those arrested Sunday were charged with disorderly conduct and
trespassing, Sweeney said. Some also were charged with resisting
arrest.
   The protest was organized by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power, or ACT UP, and Women's Health Action and Mobilization or
WHAM!
   ``ACT UP and WHAM! both have a history of forceful, loud
demonstrations,'' organizer Victor Mendolia said. ``We demand to
bring our issues to the cardinal directly and that's what we did.''
   They criticized O'Connor for his opposition to abortion and his
vocal support of Operation Rescue, a group that stages blockades
and sit-ins at abortion clinics nationwide; for lobbying against
education about safer sex and condoms, especially in schools; and
for his opposition to gay rights legislation.
   At the end of the Mass, O'Connor praised the congregants for
showing restraint and said the protest left him anguished.
   ``The archbishop of New York must of course always preach what
the church preaches, teach what the church teaches,'' O'Connor
said. ``I cannot believe that anyone, even those who hate what the
church teaches, would respect me for a moment if I taught anything
else.''

   With horns trumpeting in salute, King
Carl XVI Gustaf on Sunday presented the gold medallions of the
Nobel Prize to nine laureates from the United States, West German,
Norway and Spain.
   The winners were applauded as they received the medals. They
bowed to the king, members of the selection committee, and an
invited audience of about 400 at the white-tie ceremony. Later,
they were honored at a banquet in the City Hall ballroom.
   In Oslo, Norway, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Dalai
Lama in a ceremony attended by Norwegian King Olav V and government
officials. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after an uprising
against the Chinese occupation failed. He is living in exile in
India.
   The Stockholm honors, a highlight of Sweden's social calendar,
were broadcast on national television. Each prize was worth
$469,000, which was divided in those categories where there was
more than one winner.
   At the Stockholm banquet, Camilo Jose Cela of Spain, who won the
Nobel Prize for literature, offered a toast to world peace and
other laureates expressed hope for greater intellectual freedom.
   Americans J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus won the Nobel
Prize for medicine; Americans Norman F. Ramsey and Hans G. Dehmelt
and Wolfgang Paul of West Germany for physics; Americans Sidney
Altman and Thomas R. Cech for chemistry, and Trygve Haavelmo of
Norway for economics.
   Varmus, of the University of California at San Francisco, cited
the 8th century English poem Beowulf in his remarks about
scientific challenges.
   ``We recognize that, unlike Beowulf, we have not slaughtered the
cancer cell, we have only seen our enemy more clearly,'' he said.
   Varmus and Bishop shared the prize for their work with
oncogenes, dealing with how some tumors develop.
   Asked later by an interviewer about the chance of finding a
vaccine for the common cold, Varmus replied: ``My personal advice,
and the kind of therapy I practiced today, was to go running in the
snow, take a sauna and jump into a cold pond.''
   Altman of Yale University, also speaking for fellow laureate
Cech of the University of Colorado, said he hoped scientists and
intellectuals around the world would gain the freedom of thought
enjoyed in the United States.
   They received the prize for discovering catalytic properties in
the genetic material RNA.
   Ramsey was honored as a developer of the atomic clock and the
other physics winners, Paul and Dehmelt, were named for developing
tools to trap and study single atoms or ions.
   Haavelmo accepted the economics prize for developing theories of
econometrics.
   Cela is the author of the 1942 novel ``The Family of Pascual
Duarte.'' He said he accepted the prize on behalf of ``those who
have the glorious Spanish language for their own.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The archbishop of San Salvador
on Sunday accused U.S. federal agents of brainwashing and
blackmailing a witness in the case involving the massacre of six
Jesuit priests.
   Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas, the highest Roman Catholic
authority in El Salvador, denounced the alleged FBI coercion of
Lucia Barrera de Cerna.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker said the accusations by Rivera
Damas were incorrect.
   The archbishop, in his Sunday homily, said that Mrs. Cerna, who
was flown to the United States after it was believed she was
possibly the only witness in the case, was subjected to
``aggressive and violent'' interrogation.
   Mrs. Cerna, a cleaning woman at the Jose Simeon Canas Central
American University, was flown to Miami on Nov. 23 and placed under
the protection of U.S. federal agents.
   Mrs. Cerna had testified in a Salvadoran criminal court that
before dawn on Nov. 16, she saw men in army uniforms enter the
campus residence of the six priests shortly before shots were heard
and the bodies found.
   The slayings of the priests, all involved in education, came
during a major offensive by leftist guerrillas. Also killed were a
servant and her daughter.
   The killings brought outrage in the United States and elsewhere.
Some human rights groups and others have blamed right-wing military
death squads for the killings.
   Several U.S. congressmen called for a reappraisal of American
aid to President Alfredo Cristiani's right-wing government.
   Cristiani on Friday offered a $250,000 reward for information
leading to the prosecution and conviction of the Jesuits' killers.
At a new conference, he asserted that Mrs. Cerna's original
testimony was false and she had been discredited as a witness.
   Sources close to the U.S. investigation, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said Mrs. Cerna was given six lie-detector tests in
three days at the FBI offices in Miami, provided three different
versions of events and failed all six tests.
   Rivera Damas said in his homily:
   ``Instead of being protected, as was promised by the U.S.
Embassy in El Salvador, the witness Lucia Barrera de Cerna was
subjected in that country to an authentic brainwashing and to the
blackmail that she would be deported if she did not tell the truth.
According to the Jesuits' lawyer, Scott Greathead, the
interrogation to which Mrs. Cerna was subjected was aggressive and
violent. After this psychological torment, Mrs. Cerna vacillated
and retracted what she had said in El Salvador. But fortunately,
once again free from the pressure of her `protectors' ... she has
returned to the hallways of truth.''
   In a briefing for several foreign correspondents on Friday,
Walker asked: ``Why does anyone think we would go to all this
trouble just to discredit her (Mrs. Cerna)?''
   ``We think our (Salvador) policy is in danger if this case is
not resolved,'' he said. ``Fredy (Cristiani) is also very aware
that his political future is in danger if the case is not
resolved.''
   Walker issued a statement Sunday saying, ``I am saddened that
the archbishop does not believe that the United States government
and he are in the same quest for the truth of what happened to, and
who was responsible for (the slayings).''
   ``From the moment that this outrage occurred, there have been a
great many misinformed and unsubstantiated statements offered by
persons in positions of authority. The version that was provided to
the archbishop is incorrect,'' it said.
   However, the Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the head of the Jesuits'
Society of Jesus for Central America, told The Associated Press:
``The witness was in the hands of the FBI for several days, and we
have very serious evidence that she was mistreated. Personally, I
think she was psychologically tortured.''
   He said the Society of Jesus would protest the treatment of Mrs.
Cerna.
   Some right-wing militants in El Salvador accuse the Jesuits of
aiding the leftist rebels.

   A 15-foot fishing boat broke up somewhere
outside San Diego Harbor, killing a man and leaving two people
missing, a Coast Guard official said Sunday.
   The small boat left the harbor on a fishing trip Saturday and
apparently never returned, said Chief Warrant Officer Dan Dewell.
   ``There were no distress calls or reports of overdue boats last
night,'' Dewell said.
   Pieces of the boat, a life jacket, gas can and other debris,
were spotted floating in the water off Point Loma early Sunday by a
vessel passing through the area, Dewell said.
   About three hours later, a Coast Guard rescue crew found the
body of an unidentified adult male along the Point Loma shoreline,
he said.
   Two other people were known to be aboard the boat when it left
San Diego, said Dewell.
   The Coast Guard, Navy and others searched for them Sunday.
   Dewell said it wasn't known what caused the boat to break up,
but noted there was heavy fog off the coast Saturday night and said
it was possible the craft may have hit something as it headed back
for the harbor.

<TEXT>
   Two dozen townspeople bade a final
farewell Sunday to actress Frances Bavier at a private memorial
service for the woman American television viewers knew as ``Aunt
Bee.''
   The ceremony for Ms. Bavier, 86, who died in her sleep
Wednesday, lasted less than 10 minutes at an ice-covered cemetery
on the edge of the town she had called home for the last 20 years.
   Her ashes were placed in an urn at the gravesite. None of the
original cast members of ``The Andy Griffith Show'' attended the
service, although Griffith sent an arrangement adorned with a
moss-covered cross.
   ``I'm sure she would have liked to have had the cast here, but
she knew they were all tied up or busy. But she wanted each of them
contacted,'' said Sam Williams, Ms. Bavier's attorney.
   Williams said most people will remember Ms. Bavier as she
appeared most often to them _ the matronly aunt who took care of
Mayberry Sheriff Andy Taylor and his son, Opie, and who
occasionally provided meals for the few felons who frequented the
local jail. She continued that role in the short-lived series,
``Mayberry RFD.''
   ``Everybody who knew her, liked her,'' Williams said. ``She had
her ways. She came from New York, then Los Angeles to Siler City.
That would be an adaptation for anybody. She liked it, and they
liked her back ...''
   Ms. Bavier also did stints in vaudeville and had more than 20
years of stage experience, appearing on Broadway in ``Kiss and
Tell,'' ``Point of No Return'' and ``The Lady Says No.''
   She was a recluse, rarely stepping out of her home. Even when
she was admitted to Chatham Memorial Hospital on Thanksgiving, word
of her condition was kept secret until her release from the
hospital Monday.
   After the service, fans drove into Oakwood Cemetery to view the
gravesite. Some admitted they had hoped to see some of the show's
cast.
   ``I liked to watch the show a lot. I usually try to watch it
when I'm at home. I just thought I'd see if it was going to be a
real big occasion,'' said Alan Neal. ``If that's the way she wanted
and she's happy ... it makes me happy, I guess.''

   A single-engine airplane crashed into a
house and burst into flames Sunday afternoon, killing all three
people aboard but causing only minor injuries to the people inside
the home, police said.
   The Cessna 210 crashed at 12:52 p.m. in a sparsely populated
section of this small town about 40 miles west of Charlotte, N.C.,
said dispatcher Glenn Jolley. The plane had been headed for Florida.
   The house was virtually destroyed but the owner, David
Lancaster, his wife and three children suffered only minor
injuries, said Police Chief Jack Conner. They were treated at a
hospital and released.
   ``They are all very lucky to be alive,'' Conner said.
   One of the dead was identified as Phillip Roger Riley Sr., 47,
of Prince Frederick, Md., Jolley said. The other two were badly
burned and had not yet been identified.
   Federal Aviation Administration investigators were on the scene,
but had not yet determined the cause of the crash, Conner said.

   A man identified as a federal drug informant
pounded on a stopped police car and pleaded for help, then pulled a
gun and shot an officer to death in an apparent fit of frustration,
police said.
   ``He told us he'd had a bad day. Things were not going his
way,'' homicide division Sgt. Michael Peters said of Craig Neal
Ogan.
   ``I think he just lost his self-control and gave up to a bad
impulse,'' Peters said Saturday.
   Ogan, 35, was being held without bond Sunday on a charge of
capital murder of a peace officer in the killing early Saturday of
Officer James Charles Boswell. If convicted, Ogan could face the
death penalty or life in prison.
   Ogan worked in St. Louis as an informant for the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration, The Houston Post quoted an unidentified
investigator as saying.
   Boswell and his partner, C.M. Gainer, had pulled over a car for
a traffic violation near the Astrodome about 1 a.m. Saturday,
police spokesman J.C. Mosier said.
   Police said Ogan approached from a convenience store nearby and
started beating on the patrol car saying, ``I need help. The DEA
has abandoned me. They turned their backs on me. It's cold and I
need help.''
   Boswell was sitting in the patrol car and told Ogan to wait
until they had issued the traffic citation, police said. Ogan said
he didn't have time to wait, and when Boswell opened his door, Ogan
shot him once in the head, police said.
   Gainer chased Ogan and shot him once in the lower back. He was
in good condition at Ben Taub Hospital on Sunday, a police
spokesman said.
   Boswell, 29, was pronounced dead later at the hospital. The
four-year veteran had recently returned to duty after being
severely beaten in May with his own nightstick after trying to
arrest a man for dealing crack cocaine.

   Any effort to rush the reunification of East
and West Germany would risk instability and violence, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said Sunday before leaving for urgent
talks with allied leaders on the rapid changes sweeping the
Communist East.
   ``If it happens too abruptly, you run a greater risk that it
might not happen peacefully,'' Baker said.
   Speaking on the ABC-TV program ``This Week with David
Brinkley,'' Baker also predicted an increasing emphasis on the
political aspect of the NATO alliance as its military might becomes
less important in the new atmosphere. But he said there is no
danger that U.S. forces will pull out entirely.
   Political uncertainty in East Germany ``tends a bit, could tend,
toward instability,'' Baker said. ``We've made it clear all along
in this process that we do not seek to take unilateral advantage of
what's going on there at the expense of the Soviet Union, and we
want the process to continue to unfold in a stable way.''
   In an interview on the CBS-TV program ``Face the Nation,''
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze voiced his own concerns
about a reunified Germany. The security of postwar Europe has been
built on the assumption of a divided Germany, he said, and that
structure will not be changed easily.
   ``Is it right, is it appropriate, that the Germans would like to
have a unified state? I think that's logical,'' he said through an
interpreter. ``But what would be the circumstances ... in what kind
of Europe? Those are the kinds of questions that should be
answered.''
   In the meantime, it is reasonable to expect ``a certain
rapprochement'' between East and West Germany based on treaties and
agreements, part of an overall process of political, legal and
economic integration sweeping Europe that will lead eventually to a
disbanding of military alliances.
   ``This process should not be in any way interfered with,''
Shevardnadze said. ``It should not be slowed down.''
   During his trip, Baker plans to visit the Berlin Wall and to
make a foreign policy speech to the Berlin press club.
   The six-day trip initially was scheduled as an uneventful winter
meeting with the foreign ministers of the 15 NATO countries in
Brussels, the headquarters of the Western alliance.
   But a sequence of political upheavals in East Germany and
Czechoslovakia, following the sharp detour from orthodox communism
in Poland and Hungary, caused Baker to consult with his Western
partners in an atmosphere of uncertainty.
   They will try to figure out whether Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will continue to encourage change with unrest mounting in
East Germany and the abolition of the Communist party's monopoly of
power in the Soviet republic of Lithuania.
   Managing economic aid for Poland and Hungary and pondering the
future of NATO as a military alliance as East-West tensions recede
are also on Baker's agenda in Brussels.
   Baker said more U.S. aid likely will flow to other East Bloc
countries as they establish democracies and political pluralism and
adopt free-market economies.
   Then there is the overriding issue of German reunification and a
sharp warning recently from Moscow that the plan set forth by West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and praised by the State Department
was ``fraught with dangerous consequences.''
   French President Francois Mitterrand also has cautioned West
Germany not to push for reunification with East Germany, saying it
could upset the delicate balance in Europe.
   Other U.S. allies also are known to be nervous about the
prospect of a reunited and mighty Germany even though they are not
as outspoken as the French leader. Their concerns are partly rooted
in the devastation of Europe at the hands of the Germans in World
War II.
   Baker had planned to travel to Bonn to meet with Kohl, but
instead will meet with Kohl in Berlin Tuesday. Baker will join
President Bush in a meeting with Mitterrand in the Caribbean island
of St. Martin on Saturday.
   They, of course, will want to know if reports that Baker thinks
Kohl moved too fast are accurate.
   The Bush administration has deferred most decisions on German
reunification to the West Europeans. But the allies would not want
to get out of step with the United States.
   Baker begins his trip with a visit to London and meetings with
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd.
   The stop was a last-minute addition, and is designed primarily
to straighten out a squabble with the closest U.S. ally.
   At a NATO meeting last Monday with Mrs. Thatcher and other
allied leaders, Bush proposed an ``intensified effort'' toward the
political integration of Western Europe.
   Mrs. Thatcher has had doubts even about the current pace.
Baker's visit follows moves by Bush and Brent Scowcroft, the U.S.
national security adviser, to placate the British leader and assure
her the ``special relationship'' between Washington and London is
intact.

   President Bush gained ``more respect'' for
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Malta summit and thinks he can trust
the Soviet leader, Bush said in interviews released Sunday.
   Gorbachev is ``up against some tremendous problems and is
determined to solve them,'' Bush told Newsweek magazine.
   Asked if his view of Gorbachev had changed, Bush replied:
   ``There is certainly an element of respect for the way he has
managed the change in Eastern Europe and (his) determination to
fight for perestroika reform at home. I have more respect for him
than I did back when he first came into office, back when I first
met him or when I saw him last year.''
   Perestroika, the Russian word for restructuring, is shorthand
for the economic changes that Gorbachev is pushing to revive the
ailing Soviet economy.
   ``I think I can trust Gorbachev,'' Bush said in an interview in
Time magazine. ``I looked him in the eye, I appraised him. He was
very determined. Yet there was a twinkle. He is a guy quite sure of
what he is doing. He has got a political feel. I could tell by the
way he was laughing with us. A little wink now and then. ... I had
the feeling that I could bring up any subject at all.
   ``I told him that I never had favored this kind of meeting
before but that I had changed my mind. I am going to keep the
personal part of this going. I'll find ways to contact him in a
quiet fashion. I can write. I can call now. I'm not going to become
a pen pal, but we can communicate.''
   In the Newsweek interview, the president said Malta showed that
Gorbachev is ``firmly in control ... (and) determined to see
perestroika succeed.''
   Gorbachev is ``absolutely dedicated to it and determined to see
it succeed no matter how tremendous the problems are inside the
Soviet Union and how unpredictable the changes outside the Soviet
Union,'' Bush said.
   Asked if Gorbachev felt threatened by the prospect of German
reunification, Bush replied, ``I think he is very much concerned
about borders.'' The president added that he told Gorbachev, ``as
far as the United States goes, we were not going to be advocating
border changes.''
   Both interviews took place last week and appeared in the
magazines' Dec. 18 issues. Advance copies were released Sunday.

   Boeing Co. scientists, engineers and technical
workers booed their union's president Sunday at a meeting on
contract offers that are smaller than production workers won in a
48-day strike.
   ``Take a stand!'' several in the crowd of 2,000 to 3,000 shouted
when Charles Bofferding, president of the Seattle Professional
Engineering Employees Association, said negotiators had made no
recommendation on how they should vote on the proposed contracts.
   Ballots were mailed to 17,593 union members on Friday, with a
vote count scheduled for Dec. 18.
   The meeting at the Seattle Center Coliseum took place late
Sunday afternoon less than three weeks after settlement of the
strike by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, the longest strike against the world's largest commercial
jet builder in 41 years.
   In another development Sunday, Boeing Helicopters union workers
ratified a contract similar to that accepted by the Machinists, the
company said in a statement.
   The pact covering about 3,000 United Aerospace Workers Local
1069 workers at the Boeing Co. division outside Philadelphia is
retroactive to Oct. 5, when the old contract was set to expire
before being extended day-to-day as talks continued.
   The statement did not give a ratification vote. Union officials
could not be reached at their headquarters.
   SPEEA, which claims to be the largest outside the AFL-CIO
representing engineers and technicians, has never called a walkout
and has no strike fund, but many at the meeting carried signs
calling for members to reject the contract and authorize a strike.
   One banner read, ``Thanks, Ebeneezer.''
   The booing got loudest when Bofferding spoke.
   ``Quite honestly, it is the wage proposal that keeps us from
recommending this contract,'' he said. ``It is everything else that
keeps us from recommending against it.''
   Daniel M. Mahoney, the union's general counsel, said before the
meeting that the bargaining team had determined that SPEEA members
``are literate and well educated and could decide for themselves
how to vote.''
   One three-year offer covers 15,245 scientists and engineers, and
the other is for 12,796 technical support workers.
   Engineers and scientists, with average pay of nearly $40,000 a
year, would get a 4 percent wage increase and a productivity bonus
of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year but no further
increases.
   Technicians, with average pay of about $28,000, would get annual
wage increases of 3 percent, 2 percent and 2 percent and bonuses of
10 percent, 5 percent and 4 percent.
   In his 14 years with the union, Mahoney said the last time he
could remember a recommendation to reject a contract was in 1980,
and it was approved anyway. He also said neither side expected a
strike this time.
   Members also are voting on whether to authorize union leaders to
call a walkout, so they could reject one or both offers without
granting strike authorization, leaving leadership in a quandary,
Mahoney said.
   ``That's a definite possibility,'' he said. ``We've kicked that
around a lot.''
   Boeing officials have expressed satisfaction that the offers
announced Dec. 1 are going to a vote and say they expect approval.
   The Machinists settled for a three-year contract with wage
increases of 4, 3 and 3 percent; bonuses of 10, 5 and 4 percent of
gross pay and an improvement in the cost-of-living formula from
about 83 percent of inflation to nearly 100 percent. The bonus
package represented an 8 percent increase over Boeing's last
prestrike offer.
   The Machinists represent about 57,800 Boeing workers.

   Anti-apartheid leaders Sunday
announced a militant strategy of civil disobedience and political
pressure and urged South African whites to join them for the
``final onslaught on apartheid.''
   The plans were adopted late Saturday at a closed session of the
largest anti-apartheid conference ever held in South Africa. It was
attended by 4,662 black, white, Indian and mixed-race delegates
from 2,128 organizations.
   Several major black organizations to the left and right of
mainstream anti-apartheid groups either boycotted the conference or
were not invited.
   But Murphy Morobe, one the organizers, said the Conference for a
Democratic Future was a ``roaring success.''

   A congressional panel charged Sunday that the
federal government has failed to report evidence of the relative
safety of abortions for women.
   A report released by a House committee also claimed the federal
Centers for Disease Control has censored research on abortion, and
urged the Department of Health and Human Services to assure public
health research is not affected by political judgments.
   It also recommended increased federal support for contraceptive
research to help decrease the 1.5 million abortions obtained by
American women every year.
   ``This report provides important evidence of the relative safety
of abortion for women, since more than 90 percent of abortions
performed in the U.S. are much safer than pregnancy and childbirth,
and even the most dangerous types of legal abortions are equal in
risk to carrying a pregnancy to term,'' said Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y.

   Thousands of grieving men and women filed by a
row of white coffins Sunday, paying respects to the 14 women killed
by a gunman shouting ``I hate feminists'' during Canada's worst
mass murder.
   The flower-draped coffins of eight of the victims were placed in
the University of Montreal's hall of honor, and mourners passed by
quietly in single file.
   ``It's a shame that such a thing could happen in this world,''
said Yvon Lechance, a telephone company manager. He said he and his
family, including two university students, were there as ``part of
the human family.''
   A funeral service for nine of the victims will be held Monday
morning at the Notre Dame cathedral. The other families scheduled
private ceremonies.
   Police said Marc Lepine, 25, burst into the University of
Montreal's engineering school Wednesday and shot at women he
encountered before killing himself with his semi-automatic rifle.
   He also wounded nine women and four men.

   Macy &amp; Co., Harrod's of London and
Nordstrom Inc. are in talks with Walt Disney Development Co. about
joining an upscale Florida mall, according to a published report
Sunday.
   Peter S. Rummell, president of Disney Development Co., said the
shopping center, tentatively called The Disney Town Center, would
occupy 1 million to 1.5 million square feet in Osceola County in
central Florida.
   Disney Development is Disney's real estate development
subsidiary.
   Rummell said he could not elaborate on Disney's talks, but The
Orlando Sentinel reported that the three department store chains
were involved in negotiations.
   Macy and Nordstrom spokesmen last week denied that the companies
were talking with Disney.
   Harrod's acknowledged Dec. 1 that the London department store
seeks a long-term relationship with Disney, though officials
stopped short of confirming negotiations with Disney Development
about the mall.
   Nordstrom has 60 stores, primarily on the West Coast, but the
chain plans to build 15 stores in the Midwest and on the East
Coast, according to company officials.
   The Harrod's link with Disney formally begins Jan. 5, when it
will open its first store in the United States at a Disney-managed
property, the Queen Mary ocean liner, an attraction in Long Beach,
Calif.
   Harrod's of London is a 25-acre store is famous for its
brand-name products. Michael Cole, media director for the House of
Fraser PLC, Harrod's parent company, said the company hopes the
Queen Mary Harrod's signals ``the beginning of a major
collaboration'' with Disney.

   America's 1988 drought captured attention
everywhere, but especially in Washington where politicians pushed
through the largest disaster relief measure in U.S. history. The
Associated Press went back to track where the $3.9 billion went and
found the money spread far beyond the drought.

<TEXT>
   The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed
as salvation for small farmers devastated by a brutal dry spell,
became much more _ an unexpected, election-year windfall for
thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature's
normal quirks.
   An Associated Press study conducted over seven months found the
drought relief bill paid cash to farmers for everything from
hail-damaged kiwi fruit in California to heat-stressed radicchio in
Massachusetts, rain-bloated tomatoes in New Jersey and washed-out
bird seed in Colorado.
   Payments went far beyond the initial intent to save Midwestern
grain growers from bankruptcy, an effort _ supported by almost
everyone _ that simply grew and grew and grew.
   At each step, the program was broadened. Congress began with a
bill to aid drought victims. The lawmakers added hail to the relief
package. Then floods.
   Next came ``heat,'' an addition from the Agriculture Department.
   By the time checks were being written at the county level, the
AP found, fellow farmers elected to locally administer federal
agriculture programs were approving claims for such common perils
as insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even ``ineffective
herbicide.''
   None of those conditions should have been ruled eligible,
administrators in Washington say. Nothing in federal procedures,
however, requires paperwork to be forwarded to higher officials for
routine approval or checking.
   By the end of this October, about one-quarter of all U.S.
farmers had collected on damage to most of 506 eligible crops and
just about any kind of weather peril in 49 states. The taxpayers'
tab ran to $3.9 billion.
   ``We lucked out last year on account of the boys up north,''
said Travis Turnipseed, a Levelland, Texas, cotton farmer who's had
hail damage 23 out of the last 28 years, but collected cash for the
first time in 1988.
   Loose regulations and lax enforcement of them were the major
reasons for the government generosity, the AP found by examining
federal records in 14 states through the Freedom of Information Act.
   The politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought
received _ a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of
shriveled cornstalks and cracked, dusty fields _ played key roles
in rushing through the nation's largest ever disaster relief
measure.
   ``Being an election year, there were a lot of concessions to
farmers,'' said Dan Otto, a professor at Iowa State University.
``(The politicians) were trying to get recognized as a friend of
agriculture.''
   In the end, drought relief became a one-time bonus for thousands
of farmers in parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed
good crops at higher prices and wouldn't have qualified as disaster
areas, including parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas,
Oklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey.
   Although some producers appeared to have violated eligibility
requirements _ exceeding the allowed gross annual income, for
example _ their requests for aid were approved anyway by local
officials. Most farmers simply took advantage of a generous
program. As tough as farming is, they'd be fools not to take what
was offered, they said.
   ``It was there, so I took it,'' said Melvin Przilas, a wheat and
corn farmer in the Texas Panhandle who collected $2,254 because
hail and Russian wheat aphids damaged his 1,265-acre irrigated
farm, which grosses $300,000 to $400,000 a year.
   Government officials say they did the best they could with a
rushed program. Loopholes were tightened in 1989's smaller $1
billion drought relief program.
   ``Some farmers just got grandfathered in, that's true,'' said
Dan Shaw, deputy administrator of the Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service, which administers payment programs for
the Agriculture Department. ``What percentage, we don't know. But
that is part of the beast I guess that was created. Whenever you do
this for the whole nation, there are some people that luck out.''
   The AP found some farmers who did better than just luck out.
Those growers profited by ``triple-dipping'': reaping crop
insurance as well as drought aid on damaged crops, then replanting
the same ground for a successful harvest _ all perfectly legal
under the 1988 program.
   Disaster payments in several states also went to banks,
corporations, investment firms, churches and even local governments
such as the city of Littlefield, Texas, despite regulations
designed to match benefits to small farmers.
   In several cases, corporations ineligible for drought relief
because of the bill's $2 million cutoff on gross annual income
collected anyway because they owned a stake in a farm.
   Santa Fe Pacific Co., the railroad giant with annual revenue of
$3 billion, received a check through its energy division. The
American Cancer Society got a check, as did a unit of Texas A&amp;M
University and the mid-Atlantic headquarters in Baltimore of the
Jesuit order.
   Pryslak Farms of Great Meadows, N.J., a $9 million-a-year
produce, garden and truck farming operation, collected $100,000 for
losses on endive, escarole and leaf lettuce because the local
Agriculture Department official said he thought the $2 million
ceiling applied to just the vegetable operation.
   Wrong, say Washington officials _ the ceiling applies to revenue
from all operations.
   Despite all the apparent misapplications of aid, the program did
provide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by severe drought.
   In North Dakota, the hardest-hit state, farmers lost an
estimated $1.1 billion to the drought, but direct federal aid cut
that by 36 percent, to $706 million. In Iowa the aid, calculated by
the federal government at $335 million, went a long way, state
agriculture secretary Dale Cochran said.
   Without that money, ``it would have meant substantially more
losses to Main Street,'' Cochran said. ``Drought legislation saved
businesses from having to close their doors.''
   To examine the program, the AP interviewed agriculture experts
in 21 states then chose 14 states whose rainfall data and drought
payments were matched county by county in a computer database. From
those results, the AP selected 120 counties for further study.
   Farm Entitlement reports, the ASCS summaries of individual
farms' participation in the program, were requested for about
12,000 farms in those counties under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Because much of the ASCS paperwork never leaves the counties,
reporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to
examine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific
farmers, also available under the FOIA.
   One such farmer was Don Gresham, who raises cotton on 4,000
acres near Levelland. Gresham readily offers that he and his son
operate their farms under five different names precisely because of
federal payment limitations _ in the case of drought aid, $100,000
per farmer.
   Because of hail damage, Gresham and his companies collected
$248,662 from the drought program, plus $159,478 from federal crop
insurance. And he gambled and replanted the lost cotton acres with
milo _ and made a good crop.
   According to government program formulas, Gresham grossed nearly
$100,000 more than had he grown his cotton successfully.
   ``I'll be the first to tell you it worked out to a good year for
me,'' Gresham said. ``You can't farm without the government. You
play their game.''
