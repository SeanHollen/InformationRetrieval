   A woman described as the high priestess of a
murderous drug cult swore Friday that a former head of Interpol in
Mexico who killed two women and himself last year belonged to the
sect. Members of the sect have been blamed for 15 ritual slayings.
   The woman, 24-year-old Sara Aldrete Villarreal, protested her
own innocence and denied she urged a gang member to kill their
leader as police closed in.
   At one point, she started to cry and said, ``I want to see my
father.''
   Ms. Aldrete, a former honor student in a Texas college,
testified at her arraignment hearing that Florentino Ventura was a
member of the sect.
   Ventura, a veteran police officer who had been the Interpol
chief in Mexico since early 1985, killed his wife and another woman
and then shot himself during an argument on Sept. 17, 1988.
   Authorities called it a case of double murder and suicide. They
said Ventura, 60, and his wife, Maria Cira Villanueva, 39, got into
an argument after dining with another couple and Ventura shot his
wife and Olga Trevino Arizmendi, 39, before killing himself. They
based their report on the testimony f Mrs. Trevino's husband, Elias
Orozco Salazar, who witnessed the killings.
   Interpol is the Paris-based international police organization
that coordinates the police activities of participating nations
against international criminals. Its full name is International
Criminal Police Organization.
   Ms. Aldrete was charged with murder, criminal association and
resisting arrest.
   The charges were filed in connection with the Saturday shootout
in Mexico City in which she and four other cult members were
arrested and the ringleader, Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, and a
companion were shot to death in a closet.
   ``I never gave orders to kill Adolfo,'' Ms. Aldrete said at her
hearing before Judge Bernardo Tirado Gutierrez of the 58th Federal
District Court.
   No charges have been filed in connection with 15 macabre
slayings on a ranch outside Matamoros, a Mexican border town near
Brownsville, Texas, or the cult's purported drug-smuggling
activities.
   Authorities say the cult believed that through human sacrifices
it could gain occult protection for its drug running. Officials
said members cut off body parts and boiled organs as part of the
rituals.
   Prosectors say Ms. Aldrete, Constanzo and three other cult
members made a pact to kill each other rather than face arrest.
When Constanzo saw police on the street below, he panicked and
demanded to be killed, they say.
   They said Ms. Aldrete encouraged fellow cultist Alvaro de Leon
Valdez to turn his machine gun on Constanzo, a Cuban-born American
from Florida, and Constanzo's right-hand man, Martin Quintana.
   The death pact and her alleged encouragement are the basis of
the murder charge.
   Ms. Aldrete denied ordering de Leon Valdez to shoot Constanzo
and Quintana.
   ``Everyone was yelling,'' she said. ``I was ... extremely
nervous. What I yelled to Alvaro de Leon was that they stop
shooting, that they (the police) were going to kill all of us.''
   Speaking from behind a barred enclosure facing the courtroom,
Ms. Aldrete repeated earlier statements to authorities that she was
not involved in the ritual slayings or the drug smuggling.
   ``The way I found out about the deaths and everything that
happened (at the ranch) was when the bodies were shown on
television,'' she said.
   But she said she suspected Constanzo was involved in drug
trafficking ``because of all the money that he carried.'
   Ms. Aldrete said she tried to escape when the group fled to
Mexico City after the 15 bodies were unearthed.
   Authorities on both sides of the border had been searching for
Constanzo, Ms. Aldrete and other cult members since the first body
was dug up on April 11.
   Most of the victims' bodies were mutilated, including that of
Mark Kilroy, a pre-med student from Santa Fe, Texas.
   Ms. Aldrete said Friday she tried to attract police attention to
the hideout of the fugitive cult members by tossing a note out the
window of the fourth-floor apartment. The note said a woman was
being held hostage in the apartment.
   After the charges and her earlier statements to authorities were
read to her, Ms. Aldrete was allowed to speak briefly with a lawyer
for the first time since her arrest.
   The attorney, Horacio Moyar Quintanilla of Monterrey, said he
was hired by Ms. Aldrete's father.
   ``Something that is not there (in my previous testimony) is that
also Florentino Ventura was a `godson' of Adolfo, according to what
Adolfo told me,'' Ms. Aldrete told the court. She did not elaborate.
   Also arraigned Friday were de Leon Valdez and Omar Francisco
Orea. The lengthy prosecution statement against them also said
Ventura had been initiated into the sect.
   Two other people, Maria del Rocio Cuevas Guerra and Dr. Maria de
Lourdes Guero were charged with covering up a crime in connection
with the killings on the Santa Elena ranch outside Matamoros. Their
case was to be transferred to a federal court.
   Francisco Orea was charged with homicide, firing a weapon at
authorities, resisting arrest, criminal association and causing
injuries. De Leon Valdez was charged with the first four crimes.
   Orea and two other men also were charged in the July 1988
killing of a transvestite. Ms. Aldrete was charged with covering up
that case.

   A family of five was found shot to death
in their home Thursday after authorities became suspicious because
the three children had not shown up for school for several days,
police said.
   The victims were identified as David M. Fager, 34, his wife,
Roxane, 31, and their children, Bryce Allan, 16, Michael Edward,
11, and 9-year-old Melissa Lynn, said state police Cpl. Gary
Robbins at Fort Wayne.
   A large-caliber handgun found at the scene was believed to have
been used in the shootings, Robbins said.
   DeKalb County Prosecutor Monte Brown said the family members
were found in their beds about 4 p.m. and the handgun was found
near the father's body.
   The victims apparently had been dead for some time, possibly
since a week ago Wednesday, the last day the children attended
school.
   School officials alerted authorities because the children had
not been in school, Brown said.
   ``They contacted the Waterloo police, the Waterloo police
contacted us. We obtained a court order to go into the house and
that's when we discovered the bodies,'' he said.
   Waterloo is about 25 miles north of Fort Wayne.

<TEXT>
   The State Department issued a travel advisory
Thursday for Panama, warning Americans that ``extremely unsettled
conditions'' mean U.S. citizens shouldn't travel in the Central
American nation.
   The advisory was issued hours after President Bush announced a
series of steps, including the dispatching of 2,000 more troops to
Panama, in reaction to that nation's nullification of presidential
elections.
   Although the U.S. ambassador to Panama was recalled by Bush, the
American embassy in Panama will remain open, the State Department
said.
   But ``the extremely unsettled conditions and the reduction of
U.S. embassy personnel in Panama complicate embassy efforts to
provide full protective and consular services to Americans,'' the
State Department said. ``U.S. citizens are advised not to travel to
Panama until further notice.''
   Despite the problems on land, the operation of the Panama Canal
``continues in a normal and efficient manner. Vessels continue to
transit the canal without problem and delay.''

   When political times were bad and his photograph
album meant certain persecution, Li Dachen buried it in the park
near his house. Now, he displays with pride the pictures of his
days as a Chinese student in Leningrad.
   ``This one is an old woman who lived near my dormitory,'' he
said, cradling a torn photograph of a woman in a flowered apron.
``She often cooked me lunch on the weekend. But she is dead now. I
learned that from a letter a few years back.''
   Li, 65, is one of the thousands of Chinese who studied in the
Soviet Union during the 1950s before the two countries split in
1960 over ideological and personal matters between their leaders.
   The rift sent many Chinese back home and left thousands more
with friends and colleagues across the border, wondering whether
they would see them again.
   In recent years, however, the two socialist giants have begun to
heal that rift. Mikhail S. Gorbachev will come to China on Monday
in the first visit by a Soviet leader to China in 30 years.
   Xing Shugang, one of China's experts on the Soviet Union, laughs
when he thinks of his recent research.
   ``It was like a great big joke,'' the 59-year-old professor said
in an interview. ``Here I am a well-known scholar and I had to talk
to Americans and Japanese and Australians about the Soviet Union.
Finally, I can go back.''
   Xing, who was president of the Chinese students' association in
Moscow from 1956 to 1959, met his first Russian in 1947 when he
went to Harbin in northeastern China to learn the language.
   ``We were the young cadres of the Communist Party. I was 18 and
ready to work for the motherland. China and the Soviet Union were
close allies then and we needed help in our war against Chiang
Kai-shek.''
   At the time, Harbin was home to hundreds of Russians who had
fled their homeland following the Bolshevik Revolution.
   ``Most of them didn't really hate the Soviet government. Some
were just afraid. We were very close with them. They were not just
our teachers but our friends.''
   When the group returned to the Soviet Union in 1955, Xing said
he felt a great loss. Other Soviets soon replaced them.
   ``This was a different breed. They were the experts,'' he said,
referring to the thousands of Soviet engineers, scientists and
businessmen who came to China in the 1950s to help develop the new
communist country.
   ``Many were chauvinists, always ordering the Chinese about,
telling us what to do. We Chinese are proud people and don't take
kindly to that kind of treatment.''
   When Xing went to the Soviet Union in 1956, he looked up his old
teachers from Harbin.
   ``I found Olga Kalenin, a wonderful teacher, in a small town
outside Moscow. But it was very sad. The Soviet government had not
been good to her. They didn't treat her like one of their own. Her
son had been forced to drive a truck. Others were washing dishes.''
   Life as a student also had its unpleasant surprises.
   ``We were closely watched by the KGB. They were always trying to
get information from us,'' he said. ``It's an indication of the
problems in both our governments that this fear was and is almost
unshakeable.''
   Even now, Xing said, he sees great impediments between the two
peoples.
   ``Both of our countries are changing rapidly but we're not at
the point where we can travel freely with no worries. That's a
question of human rights. I hope that changes.''
   In his apartment with his photo album spread out on his bed, Li
sighs and turns a page.
   ``One way or the other, this summit won't change my life. The
Soviet Union was my past. Now I have nothing to do with it.''
   A retired naval officer, Li studied engineering in Leningrad in
the 1950s. During the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution of 1966-76,
he was suspected of being involved in a ``great spy ring of Soviet
agents.''
   ``It was then that I buried the book,'' he said. ``Many of my
old classmates burned theirs but I kept mine. Those were good
years.''
   Li said he remembers the first day he went to the Hermitage in
Leningrad.
   ``It was in late April. It was a clear day and I was with my
Russian friends. We spent the day looking at the beautiful
paintings and listening to them recite Pushkin. Then we drank
vodka.''
   The album, with its tattered cover, is a sad book for Li.
   ``The friends and teachers I tried to keep in touch with have
all died or left the country,'' he said. ``It's been so long.''

<HEAD>East Jerusalem's Arabs: Sticking Point in Peace Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East Jerusalem, where 140,000 Arabs live on
land annexed into Israel's capital, is emerging as a major
stumbling block to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace plan.
   Israel calls Jerusalem its ``eternal capital'' and shudders at
the hint of giving up the eastern sector captured from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East war. It includes the Western Wall _ Judaism's
holiest shrine.
   ``Jerusalem, the city of Jerusalem, all of the city of
Jerusalem, is part of the state of Israel,'' Shamir declared on a
recent walking tour of the Jewish quarter in the walled Old City.
   But the PLO also has declared Jerusalem as the capital of its
would-be state, and many Palestinians say the Arab sector must be
part of any agreement to end the bloody uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``The West Bank is the body, and Jerusalem is the soul,'' Arab
poet Fauzi Bakri said in an interview. ``One without the other is
empty, nothing.''
   The seemingly irreconcilable demands have cast a shadow over
Shamir's call for elections to choose representatives in the
occupied territories to negotiate an interim peace plan with Israel.
   Shamir and members of his right-wing Likud bloc want to exclude
the Arabs of east Jerusalem from voting.
   But the U.S. State Department and the left-leaning Labor Party,
which shares power in Shamir's coalition government, are pressing
for some arrangement to let those residents vote.
   The question is further complicated because several influential
Palestinians _ likely candidates in any election _ live in east
Jerusalem.
   More than 80 Palestinian leaders from Jerusalem and the
territories have rejected Shamir's plan, as has the PLO. They say
it does not recognize their demand for independence.
   Conflict over Jerusalem is nothing new. Canaanites, Jews,
Greeks, Romans, Christian Crusaders and Arabs have been among its
conquerors.
   Jerusalem was to have been an international city under the
never-implemented U.N. Partition plan to create Jewish and Arab
states in Palestine. The 1948 Arab-Israeli war left east Jerusalem
in Arab hands and the western sector in Israel.
   After east Jerusalem's capture in 1967, Israel sought to annex
it. It met with strikes and boycotts like those of the current
uprising, and only a few hundred Arabs accepted Israeli citizenship.
   Bakri noted that most Arabs have boycotted city elections,
believing that voting would acknowledge Israel's sovereignty.
   ``Israeli democracy for the Arabs is like plastic flowers,'' he
said. ``There is form and color but no scent.''
   Amir Cheshin, an Israeli who advises Mayor Teddy Kollek on Arab
affairs, says Israel has tried to accommodate the Arabs in the 22
years since the barricades splitting the city were torn down.
   ``There are job opportunities, travel opportunities, freedom of
the press and religion, and all the benefits of Israeli law,'' he
said.
   He noted that under Jordanian rule, Jews were not allowed to
live in the Old City and were denied access to the Western Wall,
the last remant of the ancient Jewish temple.
   ``Today, Christians, Moslems and Jews can worship freely,''
Cheshin said.
   But Israel has forced Arabs out of the Jewish quarter. Recently
it has limited access to the Al Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest
sites, because of the violence of the 17-month uprising.
   Ibrahim Dakkak, an engineer who heads an Arab development group,
charges that Israel has used the past two decades ``to try to
Judaize'' east Jerusalem.
   ``They have put rigid limits on Arab construction,'' he said.
``But they have surrounded east Jerusalem with Jewish colonies to
try to keep it forever separate from the West Bank.''
   The seven housing developments that Israel has built house about
110,000 Jews around east Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods.
   The population of Jerusalem has grown from 267,800 in 1967 to
more than 482,000 today. Municipal statistics show that four out of
every five Arabs living in Jerusalem were born in the city, while
only two in five Jewish residents were.
   Because the city is disputed territory, most Western governments
keep their embassies in Tel Aviv. Some, like the United States,
have built two consulates in Jerusalem _ one in the east and
another in the west.
   The eastern sector remains largely Arab in character.
   Men go to cafes to drink thick Arabic coffee and linger over
water pipes. Women in ankle-length dresses and white scarves sell
vegetables at street corners, and boys push carts piled high with
Arab bread through crowded markets.
   In a paean to Jerusalem titled ``Candles on the Town Wall,''
Bakri hails the city's Arab traditionalists.
   ``You are the prophets
   Of poverty and steadfastness
   In the old town
   You are the homeland.''

   OVER TANGI-ABRISHIN, Afghanistan (AP) _ Tangi-Abrishin means
Ridge of Silk and straddles the ancient trade route, but helicopter
crews flying convoy cover call it the ``Wall of Death.''
   Nearly every day, Senior Capt. Humayun, his co-pilot and
engineer have flown shotgun for trucks carrying food and weapons
from Kabul to Jalalabad, the eastern provincial capital under siege
by Moslem insurgents since March 7.
   ``This is our job. We do it for our homeland,'' said the
24-year-old pilot, who has been a member for six years of the 377th
Hero Regiment based at the airport in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan.
   On Wednesday, he flew 13 Western journalists the 75 miles to
Jalalabad in an Mi-8 chopper, over the ridge bristling with
guerrilla rockets, escorted by five Hind helicopter gunships. It
was the first trip to the city by Western reporters since the siege
began.
   Humayun says guerrillas shoot down one in four helicopters
flying over the ``Wall of Death.''
   Humayun lifted off from Kabul airport, crossed the mountains
that surround the capital, then settled his machine to an altitude
of about 30 feet, skimming at 160 mph over barren hills and valleys
dotted with bombed mud-and-brick houses and the burned wreckage of
military vehicles.
   The Sarobi oasis, where sporadic fighting has been reported,
flashed past below and the chopper climbed for Tangi-Abrishin,
which loomed ahead within minutes.
   Over a deep gorge, the crew began dropping decoy flares designed
to deflect any heat-seeking missiles insurgents might fire.
   A wedge of three Hind gunships led the passenger helicopter,
launching their own rockets, occasionally breaking formation to fly
laterally into gullies and pelt the ground with cannon and rocket
fire.
   With two gunships trailing, Humayun raced the Mi-8 through the
canyons at 130 mph, diving and weaving around hills and
outcroppings, using the terrain as natural cover.
   ``I'll fire the rockets if I suspet something is out there, but
that won't necessarily mean we're under attack,'' he said.
   Then he fired three rockets. Backfires jolted the helicopter and
Humayun's nervous passengers dived to the floor.
   In 10 minutes, the six aircraft were past the Ridge of Silk,
having bested the ``Wall of Death'' at least for now, and Humayun
said: ``The danger is over.''
   He guided the helicopter across the rocky plains and landed in a
rice paddy on the outskirts of Jalalabad, a centuries-old way
station between East and West near the Khyber Pass.
   Four hours later, he returned to take the visiting journalists
back to Kabul, this time with six attack choppers flying escort.
   Tangi-Abrishin was less than 20 miles away, and this time the
guerrilas fired two rockets.
   Humayun put the Mi-8 down in a shallow stream and two escorts
hovered above while the other four circled nearby hills with guns
blazing.
   The young pilot jumped out of the helicopter. When he returned
moments later, his passengers demanded to know why.
   ``I was thirsty,'' he said. Humayun grinned and returned to the
cockpit.
   With the way cleared, he headed his aircraft for the ridge.
Again he dropped flares, fired rockets and dodged through the
canyons. Then the seven choppers cleared Tangi-Abrishin and
clattered past Sarobi.
   Humayun opened the cockpit door and pointed at the buildings in
the distance.
   ``Kabul!'' he said, with a thumbs-up.
   The rebels control much of the countryside, but they have yet to
capture a major city. Capturing a city would give them a base for
the interim government formed in Pakistan in February and offer an
alternative to the Soviet-backed government in Kabul.
   President Najib has said the 11-year-old war will continue until
all sides agree to sit down at the negotiating table. He has called
for direct talks with the United States, which supports the
guerrillas, but Washington has rejected the idea.
   On Thursday, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said the failure of
the Jalalabad offensive proved a negotiated peace settlement was
the only solution.
   He said U.S. policy would fail if the United States continues to
support the rebels.
   ``If America wants to give them more time to demonstrate their
military power, then all they will be doing is giving them more
rockets,'' he said. ``They've had time to show their power. They
have no power. They only fire rockets.''

   Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease
associated with aspirin in childhood flu and chicken pox cases, has
reached the lowest reported level since its discovery _ just 20
U.S. cases last year, officials said Thursday.
   At its peak in 1980, Reye's syndrome struck 555 people. The
disease struck 101 Americans in 1986 _ the year in which aspirin
containers were first required to carry warnings about it.
   Since then, Reye's syndrome reporting dropped to 36 cases in
1987 and 20 in 1988, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported.
   Reye's syndrome, first observed in the 1950s, causes symptoms
including severe vomiting and lethargy, and can result in coma and
even death. It usually occurs in children and is usually preceded
by a bout with a viral illness such as influenza or chicken pox.
   Researchers have documented a link between the use of aspirin by
young patients during chicken pox or flu and the subsequent
development of Reye's syndrome.
   ``The decline in the number of RS cases since late 1980
coincides with the increased publicity about this association,''
the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   ``That is the reason,'' concluded Dr. Larry Schonberger, a CDC
researcher. ``Study after study shows aspirin is the primary cause
of Reye's syndrome. ... CDC's been pushing this since 1980.''
   The 1988 count is the lowest since national surveillance of
Reye's cases began in 1976, the CDC said.
   Nine of the 20 reported Reye's syndrome patients in 1988 had
suffered respiratory illness such as flu before the onset of
Reye's; four had chicken pox. The previous year, 18 of the 36
patients had respiratory illnesses, and seven had chicken pox.
   In 1988, as in 1987, most cases occurred in January, February or
March, the peak months for flu or chicken pox cases.

<HEAD>Jazz Promoter Max Gordon Dead At 86</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Max Gordon, who for 54 years operated the
Village Vanguard, one of the city's most influential jazz clubs,
and helped Judy Holliday and Woody Allen early in their careers,
has died. He was 86.
   Gordon died Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital.
   Gordon ran the Village Vanguard in Greenwich Village and in 1942
opened the Blue Angel in midtown Manhattan. The two clubs played an
important part in the development and discovery of new talent.
   Friends said Gordon had a talent for spotting new artists for
his club such as Holliday, Betty Comden and Adolph Green.
   Other artists he helped early in their careers included Barbra
Striesand, Pearl Bailey, Dick Gregory, Lenny Bruce, Woody Guthrie
and Leadbelly.
   Several artists such as John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins and Joe
Henderson recorded at the Village Vanguard, taking advantage of the
club's acoustics.
   Asked why he stayed in the business so long, Gordon once told an
interviewer, ``It's my life. It's what I do.''
   Gordon was born in Svir, Lithuania, and immigrated to the United
States with his family at age 5. They moved to Portland, Ore.
   After graduating from Reed College in 1924, he enrolled in
Columbia Law School but after six weeks changed his mind and left
the school.
   He worked odd jobs for six years before a friend persuaded him
to open a coffeehouse in Greenwich Village, which he called the
Village Fair. Two years later, he opened the first Village Vanguard
on Greenwich Avenue.
   A year later he moved the Vanguard to its present location at
178 Seventh Ave. South.
   Gordon is survived by his wife, Lorraine, daughters Rebecca and
Deborah and a sister, Sadye Milich.

   The Department of Veterans Affairs is taking
another look at the cases of all Vietnam veterans whose benefits
claims due to exposure to Agent Orange were denied, and easing the
standards for receiving compensation.
   The change became known Thursday when VA Secretary Edward
Derwinski said the government will not appeal a federal judge's
decision earlier this week that struck down regulations restricting
compensation for victims of Agent Orange.
   Derwinski's decision was seen as a major step toward disability
benefits for some of the more than 34,000 veterans of the Vietnam
War who have unsuccessfully sought to have the government admit
their exposure to the toxic herbicide has caused health problems.
   Derwinski said the VA will follow the judge's instructions to
review all previously denied claims and use new, statistical
standards to decide whether specific diseases are presumed to have
been caused by Agent Orange exposure.
   ``It's a very significant step,'' said Mary Stout, president of
the Vietnam Veterans of America, a 35,000-member group that filed
suit over the VA's denial of benefits in Agent Orange cases. ``I
think it does show that there's a new Veterans Administration and a
new administration that's taking a different view of the Agent
Orange situation.''
   Agent Orange was widely sprayed by U.S. forces in Vietnam as a
defoliant. Its medical effects years and decades later on the
soldiers who handled it or were exposed to it have been the subject
of intense legal and scientific debate.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson ruled this week in San
Francisco the VA had used an ``impermissibly demanding test'' in
requiring proof of a cause-and-effect relationship between exposure
to Agent Orange and specific diseases.
   Instead, he said, the agency should require only a finding of a
statistically significant correlation or ``increased risk of
incidence'' _ a less difficult standard to meet.
   Derwinski, a veteran and former member of Congress, said he had
begun ``a good hard look'' at the department's Agent Orange policy
even before the federal judge's ruling. He said he concluded it was
not good policy and ``frankly not good politics'' to fight the
ruling.
   VA officials said the department will direct its 11-member
scientific committee that reviews Agent Orange issues to take a new
look at all scientific and medical studies of Agent Orange using
the new statistical standard.
   Derwinski said he expected final decisions on the diseases by
October.
   Deputy Secretary Anthony Principi said the VA would consider any
veteran who served in Vietnam to have been exposed to Agent Orange
and would not require specific proof they were in an area where the
herbicide was sprayed.
   The department, which until this year was known as the Veterans
Administration, has consistently held that only one disease, a skin
condition known as chloracne, was caused by exposure to Agent
Orange during military service.
   As a result the VA has denied disability compensation for
veterans who claimed exposure to other diseases, including cancer.
The VA has provided medical treatment for those conditions, however.
   Whether those cancers and other illnesses can be linked
statistically to Agent Orange exposure has been a matter of
dispute. Derwinski's decision puts that question before the VA's
panel of scientists and other experts, which had concluded there
was no scientific link based on the previous standard.
   Derwinski and other VA officials said they had no way to
estimate the potential cost to the government in added benefits to
veterans if the panel agrees to a statistical assumption that
additional diseases were caused by Agent Orange exposure.
   ``The cost is irrelevant,'' Derwinski said.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House
Veterans Affairs Committee, said Derwinski's decision was in line
with congressional wishes that compensation be decided ``on the
basis of sound scientific and medical evidence.''
   ``The judge has said that the department has written the
regulations too narrowly and the department has agreed to go back
and rewrite them,'' Montgomery said. ``I think the secretary has
made the right decision.''
   Of the claims related to Agent Orange already filed, nearly
7,000 involve three main categories of illness _ non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as PCT _
for which some contend links to Agent Orange have been established.

   This was not their father's
Oldsmobile.
   But a swarm of bees still sought to call a Cutlass Supreme
parked outside a local pub home, frightening customers and leaving
a tavern waitress in a sticky situation.
   Dana Birmingham, a waitress at the Verona Lounge, wasn't
flattered when the swarm of about 20,000 bees picked her car to
settle down on Tuesday.
   ``People kept coming in and saying, `There's a swarm of bees out
back,''' said Birmingham, 29. ``Then they started to come in the
front, because they were afraid to go through the bees. I kept
trying to figure out what was on the back of my car that attracted
them.''
   When bees reproduce in the spring, colonies sometimes split in
two, with half the swarm left hiveless, said Michigan State
University entomology Professor Roger Hoopingarner. They normally
settle on a tree or bush while scouts look for a new hive location.
   ``It's a fairly common phenomenon _ but not on Oldsmobiles,''
Hoopingarner said.
   ``I was scared to drive home,'' said Birmingham, who enlisted
the aid of beekeeper Paul Parsons. He baited a hive and lured away
most of the homeless bees.
   ``Then I went to the car wash,'' Birmingham said.

   Theresa Baroody and Dorothy O'Malley are used
to their own reproductive coincidence. It's been 30 years since the
sisters discovered they'd each given birth to their fifth child on
the same day.
   But now that the kids are doing it, it's starting to seem weird.
   Ms. Baroody and Ms. O'Malley each got a grandchild on Monday _
the offspring of the coincidental cousins they brought into the
world on Feb. 25, 1959.
   Family members say the 30-year-old cousins, Patricia and
Patrick, never had trouble remembering to send each other birthday
cards, but were not particularly close as children.
   On Christmas Eve of 1985, both Patrick and Patricia announced
their engagements, Patrick to Valerie Vendetti, and Patricia to
John Von Paris.
   ``This is not something they planned,'' said Ms. Baroody,
Patricia's mother.
   Months later, the couples unwittingly chose the same wedding
date, Oct. 18, 1986. Happenstance continued as the sisters, who
both live in the Baltimore area, learned during a shore vacation
last summer that their fifth children were both expecting their
first babies early in May.
   ``I fell off my chair,'' Ms. Baroody said.

   The Sardis Lake Smokers worked on their
rap music and put the final touches on their sauce as Memphis' 12th
annual barbecue cooking contest got under way on a sunny bluff
overlooking the Mississippi River.
   ``We not only dance and do a jig. We do our best when we cook
our pig,'' the rap boomed from a tape player Thursday as the
Smokers from Sardis Lake, Miss., braced for three days of barbecue
and beer.
   The barbecue contest, with 175 teams from around the country and
abroad, is one of the liveliest of more than two dozen events in
the city's monthlong Memphis In May Festival.
   Last year's teams cooked 51,000 pounds of pork, and 80,000
spectators and participants turned out.
   Cooking teams will compete for a total of $10,000 in prize
money. Judging is Saturday.
   The main competition is for pork only, but a new twist has been
added this year, an ``anything but'' competition Friday night that
includes such entries as barbecue alligator, coon, mountain oysters
and goat.
   Barbecue participants and spectators also will take part in a
Porker Promenade parade, a Ms. Piggie contest and a hog-calling
competition.

   Television moms have taken a turn for
the real, says Barbara Billingsley, the mother on ``Leave it to
Beaver'' who always wore a dress and pearl choker while helping
Ward, Wally and the Beav.
   ``You know, the first time I saw `Roseanne,' I thought, `Ugh! I
hate the messy house.' And she herself is this big, sloppy woman,''
said Billingsley, who appeared as June Cleaver in more than 200
``Leave it to Beaver'' episodes starting in 1957.
   ``But she gives out some pretty good wisdom to her children.
There's something there, a warmth and a love that we had in a
different way,'' she said in an interview from her Los Angeles home.
   Billingsley now appears in ``The New Leave It To Beaver'' as a
working grandmother, revamped for the 1980s with a college degree
and a lower threshold for Eddie Haskell quips.

   Rock star David Bowie apparently
now believes in modern love as he has gotten engaged to Melissa
Hurley, the lead dancer in Bowie's 1987 Glass Spider concert tour.
   Miss Hurley's parents, Gordon and Joyce Hurley of Thousand Oaks
in suburban Los Angeles, said Wednesday that Bowie, 42, proposed to
their 22-year-old daughter on Tuesday during a European vacation.
   No wedding date has been set.
   Miss Hurley, who danced three years on the TV series ``Fame,''
met Bowie when she became the lead dancer in his nine-month
international Glass Spider tour. Many of her routines called for
her to act out the part of Bowie's romantic interest in his songs.
   That became a real-life role halfway through the tour.
   The English-born Bowie plans to launch a six-week concert tour
from New York this month, promoting his new album, ``The Tin
Machine.''

   ``Today'' co-host Bryant Gumbel joked and made
up with David Letterman in his first appearance on Letterman's turf
since the two began feuding four years ago.
   Gumbel's unannounced visit to NBC's ``Late Night with David
Letterman'' came at the top of the show Thursday as Letterman was
reading a satirical list of questions asked of prospective NBC
employees.
   No. 7 in the countdown list was, ``Any problem car-pooling with
Bryant?'' No. 4 was, ``Want to join squad doing inventory of Bryant
Gumbel's suits?'' whereupon band leader Paul Shaffer complained
that Letterman should lay off Gumbel because ``he might get mad.''
   Letterman said he would prove Gumbel could take a joke, went to
a studio door and brought Gumbel into the studio.
   Gumbel read the rest of the list, including No. 2, ``You
wouldn't leak a guy's memo, would you?'' a reference to the now
infamous memo Gumbel wrote to the ``Today'' producer complaining
about most of his colleagues on the show.
   The two shook hands and Gumbel left.
   The Gumbel-Letterman feud began when Letterman interrupted a
live, prime-time ``Today'' special by shouting from a window.

<HEAD>Drought and Cold Produce Smallest Winter Wheat Harvest in 11 years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's winter wheat harvest may be the
smallest since 1978 because of lingering drought and severe freeze
damage in some major producing areas.
   As a result, the thriving U.S. export trade may slacken and some
additional upward pressure will be put on consumer food prices,
says the Agriculture Department. One bright spot for the lucky
farmers: wheat market prices probably will rise further.
   The USDA said Thursday in its major crop estimate of the new
season that winter wheat production may be about 1.43 billion
bushels, down 8 percent from last year's 1.56 billion bushels _
despite a boost in planted acreage.
   Officials said the average yield, based on indications as of May
1, was estimated at 34.9 bushels per harvested acre, compared with
last year's 39.2 bushels per acre.
   Farmers are expected to have about 41 million acres for harvest
this year, up 3 percent from 39.8 million in 1988, said the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board. But there has been
widespread abandonment by growers.
   Initially, plantings totaled 54.7 million acres, meaning that
only 75 percent of the acreage planted is good enough to harvest
this year. The report said that is the lowest since 1951.
   Reggie Wyckoff, president of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, said drought in the central Great Plains and freeze damage
in the Pacific Northwest have ravaged crops.
   ``As a result, farmers in these areas deserve to receive federal
assistance similar to that offered last year'' when drought
devastated the northern plains and the Corn Belt, he said.
   Last year Congress approved a $3.9 billion emergency aid package
to help relieve some of the drought damage. Many have urged USDA to
extend the major benefits to 1989 wheat producers who have had
similar losses, but the administration says it is up to Congress.
   The new estimates provide ``solid evidence of this season's
losses, and conditions will probably get worse rather than
better,'' Wyckoff said in a statement issued here.
   ``Conditions point to lower yields than last season in the
central and southern plains, the Southeast and along the Pacific
Coast states,'' the report said.
   The Kansas wheat crop was estimated at 202.4 million bushels,
less than two-thirds of the state's 1988 production of 323 million
bushels. Washington's harvest showed a comparable decline, with
output estimated at 68.9 million bushels against 108.5 million last
year.
   Despite the sharp losses in the winter wheat areas, USDA
economist Ralph Parlett said the effect will be mild on grocery
shoppers.
   ``It's going to be small, but it will have an effect,'' he said
in a telephone interview.
   Parlett said a $1 loaf of bread has about seven cents worth of
wheat in it. Theoretically, he said, if the cost of wheat doubled
the loaf would still cost only $1.07. But he emphasized again that
was a theoretical example.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following
summer. It makes up about three-fourths of total U.S. wheat
production. The remainder is planted in the spring.
   No 1989 production estimates for spring wheat, corn and other
major spring-planted crops were included. Those will be issued by
USDA later in the growing season.
   However, in a related supply-and-demand report, USDA projected _
based on assumptions of normal weather and ``trend'' yields _ that
total wheat production in the United States this year could be
about 2.05 billion bushels, up from last year's 1.81 billion
bushels.
   The report showed wheat prices could rise to a range of $3.80 to
$4.20 per bushel, on the average, in 1989-90 from $3.74 estimated
for the current marketing year that will end on May 31.
   At the higher prices, wheat exports would drop significantly to
1.15 billion bushels from 1.46 billion bushels currently, the
report showed. The U.S. wheat stockpile on June 1, 1990, would be
drawn down to around 500 million bushels from 594 million bushels
estimated this June 1.
   The report also projected the 1989 corn crop at 7.85 billion
bushels, up from the drought-riddled harvest of 4.92 billion last
year. Soybeans were indicated at 1.95 billion bushels, up from 1.54
billion in 1988.
   But the projections were described as ``highly tentative'' and
subject to change as the season progresses.
   Another USDA report, meanwhile, showed that the Soviet Union is
headed for another bumper grain harvest.
   Department analysts said Soviet grain output could be 210
million metric tons, up 8 percent from last year's production.
   The good outlook stems from ``a relatively good growing season
to date.'' But Moscow's push for greater output of livestock
products for Soviet consumers will mean record grain use and
``continued large grain imports'' to cover shortfalls, the report
said.
   A metric ton is 2,205 pounds, equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or
39.4 bushels of corn.
   By comparison, the tentative projections put total U.S. grain
production in 1989 at 294.4 million tons, up from 203.9 million
tons in 1988.
   The Soviet forecast included 91.5 million tons of wheat, 105.5
million tons of coarse grains such as corn and barley, and 13
million tons of ``miscellaneous'' grains and pulses.
   Last year, when production was 195.1 million tons, the harvest
included about 84.4 million tons of wheat, 97.5 million tons of
coarse grains, and more than 13.1 million tons of miscellaneous
crops.
   If realized, the forecast of 210 million tons would mean that
Soviet grain production has exceeded 200 million tons in three of
the last four years, an unprecedented production record by that
country. The all-time high grain output was 237.4 million tons in
1978.

   Five songwriters including the late Roy Orbison
were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame during ceremonies
at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday.
   Orbison's widow, Barbara Orbison, received the induction plaque
presented by guitarist Eric Clapton.
   The others inducted at the Hall of Fame's 20th annual ceremony
were lyricists Lee Adams and the late Eddie DeLange and the team of
Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley. Quincy Jones received the
lifetime achievement award.
   Pepsico received the patron of the arts award and a film of its
musical commercials was shown.
   A variety of singers provided entertainment during the
three-and-a-half hour show, which was taped for broadcast on CBS,
probably the second week in June.
   Unlike past years, many of the songs performed were not composed
by the honored songwriters. A ``Tribute to Love Songs'' segment
with performances by Marilyn McCoo, Michael Bolton, Freddie
Jackson, Lou Rawls, Jeffrey Osborne and others did not include any
songs written by the evening's inductees.
   k.d. lang, Dwight Yoakam and Eddie Money each sang Orbison
songs, lang receiving a standing ovation for ``Cryin'.'' Lang and
Orbison shared the best country vocal collaboration Grammy this
year for their recording of ``Cryin'.''
   Liza Minnelli sang ``A New Life'' from Bricusse's next musical.
Newley sang ``What Kind of Fool Am I'' which he co-wrote with
Bricusse.
   Highlights of the show included Cissy Houston singing ``Come
Sunday,'' Judy Collins singing ``Bridge over Troubled Water,''
Gregory Abbott singing ``Teach Me Tonight,'' Rawls sounding like a
master tunesmith, Miss McCoo sounding delicious, Maureen McGovern's
cool ``Long Ago and Far Away'' and Patti LaBelle taking ``Look to
the Rainbow'' to the stratosphere. Miss Minnelli ended the evening
with her dynamite ``New York, New York.''

   A man who claimed he accidentally
killed his wife while swatting away insects has confessed to
beating her for calling him lazy, authorities said.
   Kenneth Combs Jr., 46, was arraigned Thursday in Village Court
on a charge of manslaughter and ordered held on $50,000 bail, said
Suffolk County Detective Sgt. Robert Doyle.
   Combs beat his wife with a broomstick handle and his fists after
she accused him of being lazy during an argument in their backyard,
court papers showed.
   He initially told police that he and his wife, Barbara, 45, had
been potting plants when a swarm of insects attacked him, said
Doyle. Combs said that while flailing his arms at the bugs, he
accidentally struck his wife on the neck with his elbow.
   She was pronounced dead at Central Suffolk Hospital on New
York's Long Island.
   Combs changed his story after the medical examiner's report
indicated that Mrs. Combs had sustained multiple injuries by being
struck several times with an object on the back, neck, torso and
arms.
   He confessed on videotape to the killing, according to court
papers.
   He said he had an argument with his wife, a grocery clerk,
because she wanted him to make more money for their 16-year-old
son's college education. Combs told police he works six days a
week, 4 a.m. to 9 p.m., at a laundry.
   ``He apparently worked a double-shift and made only $90 a day,''
Doyle said. He was also entitled to only a one-week vacation.
   The couple were married 22 years and had five children in their
teens.

   The owner of a boa constrictor boycotted
his trial on a charge of ``knowingly letting a reptile run at
large'' because he claims the snake was mangled when it was
captured.
   ``They mistreated it,'' said Frankie Dodson, who was found
guilty in his absence Wednesday and fined $125 in Henrico County
General District Court.
   The 7-foot, 8-inch snake named Slick crawled under Dodson's car
in March. Neighbors who saw the snake called authorities, who spent
eight hours trying to capture the creature.
   Dodson's brother, an auto mechanic, had to disassemble part of
the car so the snake could be reached. Authorities then heated the
car frame with traffic flares and a local pet shop owner pulled the
pet off the frame.
   He said the snake suffered burns and cuts and ``looks like
somebody sat down and carved her up with a knife.''
   Dodson said he knows he was in the wrong ``but she was in my car
on my property.''

<TEXT>
   A Los Angeles production company wants to
produce a made-for-TV movie about Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded
over Scotland before Christmas and killed 270 people, victims'
relatives said.
   Fredda Weiss, a producer for Rainy Day Productions, presented a
proposal April 29 to the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, a group
formed by victims' relatives after the bombing.
   Two other companies have inquired about making a similar film,
but the firms have made no proposals, relatives said.
   On Dec. 21, 1988, a bomb destroyed the Pan Am jet carrying 259
people near Lockerbie, Scotland. The victims included 35 Syracuse
University students studying abroad. Eleven people in Lockerbie
were killed.
   The idea of a movie drew mixed reactions from relatives of those
killed in the plane crash.
   Eleanor Hudson, the mother of 16-year-old victim Melina Hudson,
said some liked it, while others thought it was too soon to do a
movie on the incident.
   If the relatives received any money it would go to lobbying
efforts to persuade the government to investigate the handling of
the bombing and to push for improved airport security, said Mrs.
Hudson of Albany.
   ``Initially, I had mixed feelings,'' said Aphrodite Tsairis of
Franklin, N.J., whose daughter Alexia, 20, was killed. ``To think
about this bombing depicted on TV is less than comforting.''
   But so much information already is out that someone will do a
movie with or without the relatives' cooperation, Tsairis said. By
working with the production company, the relatives hope to have
some control over the final product, she said.
   As proposed, the film would be a drama focusing on what happened
after the bombing and would tell the story of the families, Weiss
said. It would not concentrate on the actual bombing and crash, she
said.
   ``It might stir people to call for an investigation,'' said
Eileen Monetti, of Cherry Hill, N.J., who lost her 20-year-old son
Richard in the tragedy. ``If that happened, then it would
definitely be positive.''

   Shootouts between police and
peasants involved in land disputes in central Mexico have left nine
people dead and 57 wounded the past two days, authorities said.
   Four peasants and a policeman were killed Thursday when officers
tried to dislodge 400 peasants illegally occupying three ranches in
this state about 200 miles north of Mexico City, said Octavio
Heredia Aranda, assistant attorney general in San Luis Potosi.
   A day earlier, four people were shot to death in San Martin
Chalchicuautla when officers who went to the home of peasant leader
Hector Castillo Sanchez were surrounded by 350 peasants wielding
guns and machetes, Heredia said.
   He said the peasants opened fire, wounding three officers.
Heredia said 24 peasants also were injured in the fighting.
   Violent confrontations over land disputes in Mexico are common.

<HEAD>Precautionary Evacuation Ordered After Train Derails in Mississippi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MERIDIAN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital and some homes were evacuated
Thursday night after three MidSouth Railroad engines and 12 cars
derailed and leaked chemicals into the Chunky River, about 10 miles
west of Meridian, officials said.
   No injuries were reported in the derailment, which occurred
about 8:30 p.m.
   ``We have directed a precautionary evacuation in a one-mile
radius around the derailment site,'' said Jim Maher, director of
the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.
   It wasn't immediately known how many patients were being
evacuated from the private Pine Forest Hospital and Sanitarium,
said agency spokesman Sandy Megrolis.
   The patients were being taken to Matty Hersee Hospital in
Meridian, a state charity hospital which has many open beds as
state officials are preparing to close it and two other hospitals
by June 30.
   By 11:30 p.m., officials said they still didn't know how many
families lived in the evacuation area. Emergency management agency
spokesman Dusty Perkins said as few as a dozen people may live
within the evacuation area.
   ``At the point of the derailment, the railroad parallels the
Chunky River and they went off on the river side of the rail line.
They're either in the water or right on it, close to it,'' Maher
said of the cars.
   Perkins said officials' main concern was one car of caustic
soda, which had dumped almost all of its 20,000 gallons into the
river. He said caustic soda can kill fish and would burn on direct
contact with the skin.
   ``Our concern now is a pollution concern, rather than a public
safety concern. Nobody is going to breathe any toxic fumes from
this and die, but we don't know what will happen to the river,'' he
said.
   Investigators had yet to determine the cause of the derailment.
   Besides the caustic soda car, Perkins said three engines were
spilling diesel fuel into the river, and three of six derailed cars
carrying ethylene glycol alcohol had small leaks.
   He said four derailed cars carried vinyl chloride, but they
weren't leaking. He said the vinyl chloride could create toxic
fumes if it caught on fire.
   He said the remaining derailed car carried plastic beads of
styrene B, which would only be hazardous if it burned.

   George Bush won't have to worry about one
thing following his response to his first major international test
as president: few will accuse him of overreacting.
   For days, the administration had raised expectations of a tough
response to the defiant attitude of Panamanian leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   ``No option is being ruled out,'' White House and State
Department spokesmen said after Noriega, according to scores of
international observers, tried to rig Sunday's national elections
and then decided to throw out the results. Some in Congress were
publicly advocating the removal of Noriega by military force.
   After Bush's brief statement Thursday listing the steps he
intended to take, a reporter asked an administration official how
such modest measures would induce Noriega to seek another line of
work.
   ``We hope he will see the error of his ways,'' the official said.
   But after carefully calculating potential costs and benefits,
Bush apparently felt that a pugnacious response to the tumult in
Panama could be counterproductive.
   Perhaps recalling John F. Kennedy's darkest hour early in his
presidency, Bush may have decided he was not about to risk a Bay of
Pigs-type disaster in Panama.
   Uprooting Noriega with military force presumably would be a
cinch for the Pentagon but the diplomatic costs for the United
States would linger for years, given the Latin American aversion to
evidence of American heavy-handedness.
   The Latin Americans would have been equally unforgiving if Bush
had decided to respond by scrapping the Panama Canal treaties.
   Imposing a trade embargo against Panama would cause even further
damage to the country's already weak economy, but the costs for the
large American business community would be high _ too high, Bush
apparently felt.
   At the start of his remarks, Bush stressed the need to send a
clear signal in support of democratic values in Latin America. But
the one significant action he took _ dispatching more than 2,000
combat troops to Panama _ had less to do with democracy than with
protecting American lives.
   That was the way Bush portrayed the troop movement, but he
wouldn't object if Noriega gave it a less benign interpretation. It
wouldn't be the first time that a strong country tried to achieve
its political goals by projecting its military power without
actually using it.
   Bush is now hoping that international public opinion will
encourage Noriega to do what the Philippines' Ferdinand Marcos did
three years ago _ surrender power to someone who supposedly has a
legitimate claim to it, namely Guillermo Endara, the opposition
candidate last Sunday.
   Some European countries have already weighed in against Noriega
but the Latin Americans thus far have been disappointingly slow to
respond, according to State Department officials.
   At an Organization of American States meeting Wednesday, only
Venezuela, Peru and El Salvador joined the United States in
denouncing Noriega. Delegates from 27 other countries remained
silent.
   Mexico's view is that elections are an internal matter and
should not be on the OAS agenda. But OAS foreign ministers
nonetheless are expected to convene here next Tuesday at
Venezuela's request to discuss the Panama question.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has spoken often of the
need for the United States to act in concert with Latin American
countries on issues of common interest. That policy will be put to
its first significant test at the OAS meeting.
   In his first brush with a crisis situation, Bush clearly showed
he is no bomb thrower. Rhetorically, the administration could not
have been tougher on Noriega during the week preceding the election
and in the immediate aftermath.
   All of Noriega's perceived efforts to impose his will on the
Panamanian people were trumpeted from government podiums around
Washington. Noriega was portrayed as Willie Horton in khaki. In the
end, though, Noriega was treated kinder and gentler than Michael
Dukakis _ well, almost.

   President Bush is winning broad support from
Congress for placing ``a much tighter noose'' around the neck of
Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega without an excessive show of
military force.
   But many lawmakers say Bush will encounter intense pressure for
direct military action to topple Noriega from power and return
Panama to democracy if the situation there worsens, if U.S.
civilians are attacked or if the security of the Panama Canal is
threatened.
   Democratic leaders of the Senate and House joined their
Republican counterparts in endorsing as ``measured,'' ``reasoned,''
``careful'' and ``deliberate'' the Bush plan to protect the 50,000
American civilians in Panama and to send an additional 2,000 combat
troops there.
   They also endorsed his decisions to open a diplomatic offensive
in Latin America and elsewhere to repudiate Noriega's efforts to
undermine last Sunday's presidential election and to condemn the
subsequent violent attack on Panamanian opposition leaders.
   But several lawmakers questioned whether Bush has carefully
considered how the United States will respond if international and
domestic pressure fails to achieve Noriega's downfall.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the Senate's deputy Democratic
leader, said Bush has so far rejected pressure to either invade
Panama or scrap the treaties that commit the United States to turn
over control of the Panama Canal at the end of the century.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and other key
lawmakers acknowledged that many members of Congress believe the
president did not go far enough and should take tougher action to
drive Noriega from power.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the people of Panama, who by
most accounts defeated Noriega's handpicked presidential candidate
by a 3-to-1 margin, may be able to settle matters on their own.
   But Lugar also declared that the United States has the right to
``to keep all further military options open for response to
potential crises.''
   ``We're drawing a much tighter noose around Noriega's neck with
every one of these unified actions,'' Lugar said.
   The bipartisan leadership of Congress issued a joint statement
expressing support for the Republican president, a step that was
unheard of in the rancorous and bitter partisan debates that marked
major foreign policy actions in the Reagan administration.
   The statement was signed by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas;
Senate Majority leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; House Majority
Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.; House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel,
R-Ill.; and Dole.
   At a news conference, Mitchell said he had told the president
there will be those ``who think this does not go far enough.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on Latin America, said he commended Bush for
his restrained action despite a probable ``tremendous degree of
pressure on the president to take actions that were more strident.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, emerging Thursday afternoon from
a briefing for House and Senate members, said he found wide support
for the president's ``very careful, very measured response.''
   Many members of Congress said they agreed with that.
   But Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., sounding a cautionary note,
voiced the hope the president would consult with Congress under the
terms of the War Powers Act if there were any chance that U.S.
troops might be involved in combat in Panama.
   ``I want to be certain that we act all together so we don't have
a split between members of Congress and the administration as we
take action,'' Adams said. ``The situation is fraught with peril
and we want to have more than just briefings, we want them to use
the law.''

<HEAD>New Bill Would Extend Air Pollution Deadlines But Toughen Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new anti-pollution bill would extend
already-expired deadlines for cities to meet clean air requirements
but force many areas to install tougher pollution controls.
   Hearings on the bill were quickly scheduled for May 23-24 by
chief sponsor Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Energy and Environment health subcommittee _ the panel with initial
jurisdiction over clean air legislation.
   The legislation is certain to be controversial, because it would
require tough new controls on auto emissions. The powerful chairman
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. John D. Dingell,
D-Mich., has opposed such controls in the past.
   Almost every U.S. city is in violation of the current Clean Air
Act's Dec. 31, 1988, deadline for meeting air pollution standards.
The non-compliance could bring those areas economic penalties such
as moratoriums on new industrial facilities or a cutoff of federal
highway money.
   The new measure, sponsored by more than 100 lawmakers, would end
the economic threat, except for areas that act in bad faith in
combatting air pollution.
   Instead, the legislation would extend the deadlines but require
the most severely polluted localities to install tougher pollution
controls.
   Local areas would be classified as having either moderate,
serious, severe or extreme air pollution. Moderate areas would
receive four years to attain federal standards, serious areas would
get eight years, severe areas 12 years and extreme areas 16 years.
   Each area would have to install special measures based on the
category _ the higher the category, the more measures to be
required. Controls would range from tighter control of new
pollution sources to requirements for greater use of alternative
fuels.
   The legislation would require stricter standards for tailpipe
emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, the two key
components of ozone pollution. Controls also would be tightened for
carbon monoxide, including a special standard for cold-weather
conditions.
   New requirements also would be installed for reduction of
hydrocarbon pollution from the evaporation of gasoline while cars
are running, parked or refueling.

   For Judy Boyle, the treasure that
she took with her was a small chandelier she bought on a trip to
Austria. For her four-year-old son Blake, it was a plastic dinosaur
and a mastodon.
   Like hundreds of other Americans in Panama, they took an hour
Thursday to pack up their lives.
   President Bush on Thursday ordered all U.S. military and
diplomatic dependents into secure housing following a brutal attack
by supporters of strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga on the
opposition presidential and vice-presidential candidates and the
nullification of Panama's elections.
   ``I tried to take something that meant something to me,'' said
Ms. Boyle, whose said her family is from ``a lot of places in Texas
_ Dallas, San Antonio.''
   It was about 4 p.m. when Boyle and her husband, Emil Kirberg,
both civilian employees of the Army, heard the news of their
evacuation on Armed Forces Radio.
   ``Nobody's been getting much work done the last few days,'' said
Ms. Boyle, an auditor. ``Everybody's been listening to the news.''
   Most of the 10,600 U.S. military dependents in Panama already
live on base, and the Kirberg family had been offered on-base
housing last year.
   ``But it was tiny, and by that time we had a beautiful apartment
in Panama City on the 10th floor overlooking the bay,'' she said.
   Despite months of demonstrations against Noriega's government,
they decided to stay.
   ``We've never had any trouble at all. The Panamanians have been
wonderful to us,'' said Kirberg, who's been posted here since 1987.
   ``I'd like to see the Panamanians have the same freedom we do,''
said his wife.
   They were part of an emergency plan for off-base families in
which on-base sponsors agree to take them in on what they hope will
be a temporary basis.
   The Kirbergs knew their sponsor well: he was Kirberg's boss, Leo
LeBlanc.
   `We take care of our own,'' LeBlanc said.
   Boyle and her husband both work at Fort Clayton; she has an
office overlooking the Miraflores Locks of the Panama Canal.
   They rushed to their home in Panama City about eight miles away.
They gave themselves a half-hour to pack, but it took an hour.
   They left behind clothes, furniture, curtains. Blake had to
leave his Ghostbusters game. They asked a family of American
missionary friends to take the dog. Their landlord assured them he
would take care of things ``if anything happened.''
   They stuffed their car with suitcases, pillows and blankets.
Blake was barely visible behind his mother's chandelier.
   ``I'm hoping if we have to leave they'll at least let me mail it
home,'' she said as it was unloaded at the LeBlanc home.
   They went to a grocery store and bought Blake some Rice
Krispies. He quickly tried to dig through to the goldfish prize at
the bottom of the box.
   ``I like Panama,'' the boy declared. While the Kirbergs were not
the only Americans on the move Thursday, many were staying put.
   An Army family that lives near Albrook Air Force Base said they
were being permitted to remain off base because they were already
so close.
   An American who works for a commercial importing firm in Panama
City said he had considered taking up Bush's offer to shelter any
American, ``but I don't want to live on an Army base.''
   Both families asked that their names not be used.
   LeBlanc said he had three spare bedrooms because his daughters
are in college. He was planning to put a family in each.
   His wife had run out to rent some videotapes to entertain their
guests, which also included three children.
   ``It's going to be great to hear the patter of little feet
again,'' LeBlanc said.
   ``I don't know,'' said Kirberg, dubiously looking at LeBlanc's
neat living room. ``Blake's got enough toys with him to trash this
joint.''
   Both Blake and Kirberg said they thought it was better to be
safe than sorry, and they felt safer behind the tall chain-link
fence that surrounds Fort Clayton.
   But they were upset to leave their home.
   ``I wish things were better so we could stay,'' Ms. Boyle said.
``You never feel comfortable in somebody else's home.''

   North Americans are less likely than
Europeans to fear dying when a panic attack strikes but more likely
to think they may be going crazy, a new study suggests.
   North Americans also appear more likely to avoid situations in
which previous attacks occurred, a condition that can make a person
housebound, said researcher Heinz Katschnig of the University of
Vienna in Austria.
   The differences may reflect cultural influences on how people
perceive symptoms, or different kinds of panic disorder, Katschnig
said.
   Panic attacks afflict some 1.2 million Americans, who suddenly
suffer overwhelming terror for no apparent reason.
   Katschnig and colleague Michaela Amering studied 1,168 panic
attack patients from 14 countries. They presented the work Thursday
at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.
   The different responses also may result from cultural
differences in how people describe panic attacks, Katschnig said,
or they may reflect differences in how patients in the study were
signed up in different countries. The patients had been recruited
for a drug trial.
   The study included 220 panic attack sufferers in the United
States and Canada; 367 in southern Europe (Belgium, France, Italy
and Spain); 324 in northern Europe (Austria, Denmark, West Germany,
Sweden and the United Kingdom); and 257 in Latin American (Brazil,
Colombia and Mexico).
   Dizziness, feeling faint and palpitations were the most common
symptoms reported by about 90 percent of patients in each of the
four geographic areas.
   Choking or smothering was reported most often in the Latin
American group, followed by southern Europe, northern Europe and
North America.
   Fear of dying followed the same ranking, suggesting it is a
reaction to the sense of choking or smothering, Katschnig said.
   Forty-four percent of North American patients said they feared
death during the attacks, compared to 57 percent of patients from
northern Europe, 70 percent from southern Europe and 72 percent
from Latin America.
   Fear of ``going crazy'' and a sense of unreality were each more
common in the Americas than in Europe, suggesting the fear was a
reaction to the feeling of unreality, Katschnig said.
   Seventy-three percent of North American patients and 64 percent
of Latin American patients reported fear of ``going crazy'' during
an attack. Just under half of the two European groups reported it.
   While 91 percent of the North American patients reported
avoiding situations they associated with previous attacks, only 65
percent of South American patients did. Seventy-nine percent of
northern Europeans reported avoiding such situations and 72 percent
of southern Europeans did.
   Staying home to avoid those situations may be more common in
cultures where most of one's needs can be met at home, through such
means as ordering out for meals, Katschig said.
   The Austrian researchers collaborated with German and American
scientists on the study.
   Armand Loranger, a psychologist at Cornell University Medical
College, cautioned that studies comparing countries must rule out
non-cultural explanations before ascribing differences to culture.
   For example, he said the study sample may be skewed by
differences in how often panic attack victims end up at psychiatric
facilities.

<HEAD>Sandinistas ``Smarter Than Noriega'' About Elections, Panelist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the Bush and Carter
administration say the furor over last weekend's elections in
Panama may bode well for prospects that Nicaragua's Sandinista
government will conduct fair balloting next year.
   ``I am prepared to accept the Nicaraguan government's intention
today to carry out an honestly counted election,'' Francis MacNeil,
who was President Carter's ambassador to Costa Rica, told the
Commission on Free and Fair Elections in Nicaragua.
   ``Certainly they have before them the example of Gen. Noriega,
who has demonstrated how not to steal elections,'' MacNeil said
Thursday in the final round of three days of hearings by the
privately financed, conservative-backed bipartisan commission.
   His testimony came as President Bush urged allied nations to
join in condemning Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's military
leader, for election fraud in Sunday's balloting, in which Noriega
has claimed victory.
   On Wednesday, Peter Rodman, special assistant to the president
for national security affairs, told the commission, ``I think the
Sandinistas may well have been watching what happened in Panama.''
He added, ``the Sandinistas are smarter than Noriega.''
   But Keith E. Schuette, president of the National Republican
Institute for International Affairs, said his group found
``disturbing parallels, too frequent to be considered accidental,''
in the election laws, government organization and opposition in
Nicaragua and Panama.
   ``Sufficient freedom of organization, expression and activity
does not currently exist to ensure a free and fair election'' in
Nicaragua, Schuette said Thursday.
   Luigi Einaudi, director of policy planning for the State
Department's Bureau of Inter-American affairs and
ambassador-designate to the Organization of American States, agreed
the nature of the Nicaraguan government ``raises major questions
about the ability to in fact carry out a free and impartial
election.''
   However, Einaudi said, ``These need not be insurmountable
obstacles.'' He expressed ``cautious optimism that the game is not
automatically over and that it may in fact be possible to move the
political conflict in Nicaragua to the political ground and away
from the military.''
   The Nicaraguan elections are to be held in February 1990 under
an agreement Managua made with the governments of Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

   Here are some facts and figures on Panama:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Panama is an S-shaped tropical isthmus that links
Central America and South America. It is bordered on the west by
Costa Rica and on the east by Colombia. It is slightly larger in
area than the state of West Virginia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The country has 2.2 million people, 70 percent of
them a mixture of Spanish and Indian descendants. Fourteen percent
are West Indian, 10 percent are Caucasian and 6 percent Indian.
Spanish is the official language but English is widely spoken. The
main religion is Roman Catholicism.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE GOVERNMENT _ The government is headed by acting President
Manuel Solis Palma, who is to turn over power to the next elected
president on Sept. 1. Panama's de facto leader is Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, the armed forces chief who engineered the ouster
of President Eric Arturo Delvalle in February 1988. Delvalle had
tried to fire Noriega, who was indicted in Florida on drug
trafficking and money laundering charges. Noriega has denied the
charges.
   The United States, which has continued to recognize Delvalle,
imposed economic sanctions against Panama in an effort to force
Noriega from power.
   Noriega inherited command of the military from Gen. Omar
Torrijos, who seized power in 1968 and died in a plane crash in
1981.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE CANAL _ The 51-mile Panama Canal that connects the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans was built by the United States from 1904 to 1914
on territory leased from Panama.
   Treaties signed by then-President Carter and Torrijos in 1977
transfer control of the canal and its defense to Panama on Dec. 31,
1999.
   The 10-mile-wide canal zone was turned over to Panama after the
treaties went into effect in 1979.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Panama was a leading international financial
center with about 120 banks holding an estimated $30 billion in
assets. But a flight of capital caused by the political struggle
over Noriega's rule has sharply reduced assets to about $8 billion,
according to government figures.
   U.S. officials have complained that secret bank accounts the
country offered as business enticements helped make Panama a haven
for illegally laundered drug money.
   Opposition leaders say unemployment last year more than doubled
to 23 percent.
   The country's main crops are bananas, pineapples, cocoa, corn,
coconuts and sugar.
   The official currency is the U.S. dollar, but it is called the
balboa.

   Even though his murder conviction was
questioned in the movie ``The Thin Blue Line'' and the verdict
against him eventually thrown out, Randall Dale Adams does not feel
vindicated.
   But since he is unlikely to get a new trial, Adams said
Thursday, he hopes to spread his story widely, hoping it will help
keep others from getting railroaded.
   Adams and filmmaker Errol Morris answered questions from about
300 people following a special screening of the film here Thursday.
   Since Adams' release March 22, Morris said he had received many
letters from prisoners proclaiming their innocence. Adams' lawyer,
Randy Schaffer of Houston, also has been deluged with requests for
help.
   Morris said he was flattered his work had led to the release of
Adams, convicted in 1977 for the slaying of Dallas policeman Robert
Wood, but was a little overwhelmed.
   ``I have been getting a lot of letters from lawyers and
prisoners, but I'm a filmmaker, not an investigative journalist,''
Morris said.
   ``Even (distant) family members are calling, saying they're in
trouble,'' Morris said. ``No more `miscarriage of justice' films
for me.''
   Adams, 40, spent more than 12 years in a Texas prison and once
faced execution for the 1976 slaying. In 1980 his death sentence
was commuted to life in prison.
   In Morris' documentary, David Ray Harris, an inmate now on death
row for another murder, recanted his testimony against Adams and
all but confessed to the killing.
   The Texas Court of Criminals Appeals set aside Adams' conviction
March 1, ruling the prosecution suppressed evidence and used
perjured testimony. The Dallas County district attorney's office
dropped the charge March 24, saying evidence was insufficient for a
new trial.
   ``I would have preferred to have a jury in Dallas release me,''
Adams said in an interview. ``I'm not fully satisfied.''
   Adams was set free March 22 and has hit the talk show and
lecture circuit since returning to Columbus, where he lives with
his mother on the city's west side.
   ``It's been very therapeutic for him going around the country to
talk about his case,'' said Schaffer, the attorney. ``The reaction
he has gotten has probably done more for him than any psychiatrist
could have done.''
   Adams was asked whether he felt bitter about the time he spent
in prison.
   ``I don't like the fact that the years were taken from me,''
Adams said. ``But I'm happy they didn't execute me 10 years ago.
Monday would have been the 10-year anniversary of my execution
date.''
   Adams was asked if he thought Harris would ever be tried for
Woods' slaying.
   ``The only way they could try Harris is if they got Randall
Adams to testify and I don't think they're big enough to do that,''
he said.
   Tickets to the film showing were $10 each, with proceeds going
toward the Randall Dale Adams Benefit Fund. The fund was
established to help Adams pay legal expenses.

   The widely publicized vindication of former death
row inmate Randall Dale Adams has created public mistrust of Texas
prosecutors and is forcing them to think about fair play, local
attorneys say.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals threw out Adams' capital
murder conviction March 1 and he walked from prison March 22 after
an appeals process that stemmed from a documentary film saying
Adams had been unfairly convicted.
   Since then, a prosecutor involved in the case has been fired,
two others have resigned, a former Dallas detective has been
investigated _ and cleared _ on perjury allegations, and the State
Bar of Texas has begun a review of claims that a former prosecutor
suppressed evidence in Adams' 1977 trial.
   In April, 17 potential jurors had to be stricken from a Dallas
murder case panel after saying they distrusted prosecutors.
   One said he could not believe anything presented by Assistant
District Attorney Winfield Scott, who led a last-minute rally to
keep Adams behind bars.
   Scott since has been fired.
   ``I think it's too early to tell whether anything positive will
come out of this,'' said Adams' attorney, Randy Schaffer of
Houston. ``They terminated Winfield Scott _ that's a start.''
   ``This case might have brought home what happens when you don't
play fair _ in a real dramatic way,'' said Leslie McFarlane, who
represented the state when Adams was arguing for a new trial, then
resigned shortly after the case was dropped.
   ``It might have cost the district attorney a credibility price
in the short term, but I don't think so, in the long term,'' he
said.
   Ms. McFarlane said she believes it was right to drop the charge.
   Adams, 40, was convicted for the 1976 shooting death of Dallas
policeman Robert Wood and came within three days of execution
before his sentence was commuted to life.
   Public awareness of the case was revived last year by the Errol
Morris documentary ``The Thin Blue Line,'' which questioned the
truthfulness of witnesses including David Ray Harris, the star
prosecution witness against Adams.
   Harris has since virtually confessed to the slaying. He is on
death row for an unrelated killing.
   The appeals court, in overturning Adams' conviction, ruled that
then prosecutor Doug Mulder had suppressed evidence and several
witnesses lied under oath during Adams' trial. The state bar
association is reviewing Mulder's actions in the case.
   Ms. McFarlane and colleague John C. Creuzot, who also worked on
the case, submitted their resignations April 5, the same day Dallas
County District Attorney John Vance fired Scott, one of the
original Adams prosecutors.
   Scott and Vance did not return repeated calls from The
Associated Press over a two-week period. Mulder, now a private
defense attorney, also did not return calls.
   A Dallas County grand jury this month declined to indict a
former Dallas police detective, Gus Rose, who allegedly had
perjured himself in a December appellate hearing on the case.
   Mark Obbie, editor of Texas Lawyer, said several attorneys have
called the weekly magazine asking about the case.
   ``There's a certain amount of defensiveness,'' Obbie said.
``They're afraid of what New Yorkers and Californians will say
about Texas, and they (attorneys) wish that the system were
better.''
   Schaffer said Adams' case could occur anywhere.
   ``Prosecutors still get promoted and see their careers made by
whether they win the case or not,'' Schaffer said. ``In the glare
of the publicity and the TV cameras, the pressure will always be on
prosecutors to cut corners to make their cases as quickly as
possible.''

<HEAD>Depositors Continue to Abandon Thrifts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Withdrawals from the nation's thrift
institutions remain near record levels and prospects for
substantial improvement remain dim, economists say.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Thursday that depositors
withdrew a net $8.5 billion in March compared with $9.2 billion in
February and a record $10.8 billion in January.
   It was the 11th month in a row in which thrifts lost ground and
the fifth of withdrawals in excess of $7 billion.
   ``I don't know that the withdrawals can continue at these levels
for the rest of the year without threatening the solvency of major
institutions. Almost by definition it has to get better, but it
won't get all that much better,'' said economist Paul Getman of the
WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm.
   Net withdrawals for the first three months of 1989 totaled $28.5
billion _ more than triple the $8.4 billion outflow for all of last
year. From October 1987 through April 1988, money had moved into
S&amp;Ls as stock market investors sought the safety of federally
insured accounts.
   Getman said he sees little prospect of improvement in the two
main factors driving the withdrawals: shaky public confidence in
S&amp;Ls and rising interest rates at competitors such as mutual funds.
   Interest rates, after a temporary lull, will begin rising again
later this year, he predicted. And he said he doubted confidence
will improve because President Bush's proposed S&amp;L bailout will
increase the rate of thrift takeovers and closings.
   ``Thrifts are going to be in the news in a negative sense as far
as the eye can see,'' he said. ``That's not to say the Bush plan is
not a good thing, it is. ... (But) depositors don't make fine
distinctions.''
   However, James Barth, the bank board's chief economist, said,
``Apart from a few isolated instances, there is no evidence that
the outflows reflect a loss of depositor confidence.''
   Economist Martin Regalia of the National Council of Savings
Institutions, a trade group, agreed that rising interest rates are
driving the bulk of withdrawals.
   With the housing market weak and short-term and long-term
interest rates nearly identical, S&amp;Ls see little need to attract
more deposits, he said.
   ``I'm not alarmed by the (outflow) number. ... If it got to the
point where institutions that wanted to keep deposits couldn't,
then it would be more serious. Right now we have not heard anything
to that effect,'' Regalia said.
   But Getman said large institutions in California, where the
housing market is booming, are suffering because of difficulties in
attracting funds.

<HEAD>`Pebbles' Would Cut Cost of Space-Based Defense, Pentagon Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Implementing the ``Brilliant Pebbles''
space-based defense plan could reduce the $69.1 billion pricetag
attached to the early development stage of Star Wars research, says
a Pentagon official.
   Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr., director of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, told members of the Senate Appropriations
defense subcommittee Thursday that Brilliant Pebbles could trim the
cost of Phase I of Star Wars. He did not provide specifics.
   The United States has invested about $17 billion in SDI,
commonly known as Star Wars, and members of the Senate panel
expressed reservations about the direction and the high price of he
research program.
   ``The members of Congress and their constituents must ask
themselves whether the nation can afford SDI and whether the return
on the investment is justified,'' said Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, chairman of the subcommittee.
   Inouye called current spending on Star Wars ``robust,'' and said
the $17 billion ``could have been funded in other weapons.''
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, criticized the research program as
``ill-defined with conflicting goals.''
   ``Ronald Reagan told us SDI is to protect people. It looks like
we're going to protect missiles,'' Harkin said.
   But Monahan sought to assure the lawmakers as he described the
Brilliant Pebbles process and the Pentagon's current plans.
   Monahan said the Defense Science Board and the Jasons, a group
of university professors, mostly physicists, will review the
concept for the department this summer.
   ``This fall, subsequent to Brilliant Pebbles study efforts ...
we will reexamine our space-based architecture with a view toward
the degree of incorporation of this concept,'' Monahan said.
   Under the system, 3,000 to 5,000 satellites, about three feet
long and weighing less than 100 pounds each, would be placed in
orbit about 400 miles above the Earth.
   Brilliant Pebbles is supported by outgoing SDI chief, Lt. Gen.
James Abrahamson, who predicted in a Feb. 9 memorandum that it
could be deployed in space for about $25 billion, far less than the
estimates of $45 billion for other SDI orbital systems.
   Monahan said recent budget cuts have forced the Pentagon to
delay work on some Star Wars research, including a six-month slip
in development of a tracking satellite and a two-year delay in a
demonstration experiment.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed cutting the fiscal
1990 budget for Star Wars from the $5.9 billion called for by
former President Reagan to $4.6 billion.
   Overall, five-year spending on Star Wars would be cut from $41
billion to $33 billion.
   In an appearance last month before the House Armed Services
Committee, Cheney said money for Star Wars ``will buy us the
capability to look aggressively at Brilliant Pebbles.''
   ``If Brilliant Pebbles does not work out, the ultimate
deployment date of the current space-based missile program would
slip by two years,'' Cheney said. He did not set a date.

<HEAD>Dollar Hits Eight-Month High Against Yen, Stocks Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar today hit an eight-month high
against the Japanese yen, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange fell.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, an 89.14-point
gainer Thursday, shed 215.16 points, or 0.63 percent, to finish at
33,866.33 points.
   The dollar ended trading at 135.80 yen, up 1.25 yen from
Thursday's close of 134.55 yen. Opening higher at 135.40 yen, the
currency remained above that level throughout the day's trading and
at one point hit 135.83 yen.
   It was the dollar's highest closing rate against the yen since
the currency closed at 135.60 yen on Sept. 6.
   Traders said the dollar's surge followed overnight gains against
most major currencies, including the Japanese yen, on overseas
markets.
   The dollar's rise was triggered by a decision Thursday by
President Bush to send U.S. troops to Panama to help protect
Americans in that country, said a trader at the Bank of Tokyo.
There are 10,000 troops already based at U.S. installations in
Panama.
   The U.S. currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of
international tension.
   In a news confernce this morning, Finance Minister Tatsuo
Maruyama said he was not alarmed by the dollar's surge. ``The
dollar was bought due partly to its (potential) strength at the
time of an emergency such as confusion'' over the Panamanian
situation, Maruyama said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices declined on a broad
front due to concerns over the yen's fall and the possibility of a
discount rate hike.
   Some Japanese economists have said the nation's monetary
authorities are waiting to assess price data due later this month
before deciding on the timing for cutting the discount rate, which
now stands at a post-World War II low of 2.5 percent.

<HEAD>Industry Leader Says Rule Changes Won't Revive Nuclear Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal rule changes aimed at speeding up
licensing of nuclear power plants are inadequate and won't revive
the stagnant industry, an official of a leading nuclear utility
told Congress.
   Richard B. Priory, a senior vice president of Duke Power Co.,
said his company's analysis of the rule change _ which takes effect
next Thursday _ does not alter its view that ``nuclear power is not
now a viable option in this country.''
   Priory told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee Thursday
that while the rule change adopted by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission was a step in the right direction, it did not go far
enough in freeing utilities from legal entanglements.
   ``The rule ... does not provide the necessary assurances that a
utility, having invested more than a billion dollars in a nuclear
power plant, will be able to operate that plant in a timely manner,
or indeed, to operate it at all,'' he said.
   Priory's main objection was that the NRC rule did not eliminate
the possibility of someone raising a legal challenge to a completed
nuclear plant after it had received its operating license but
before it could begin running.
   He said Congress should amend the 1954 Atomic Energy Act to
limit the possibility of such 11th-hour challenges, which in recent
years have stopped plants from opening.
   Duke Power, which provides power in North and South Carolina and
relies on nuclear plants for two-thirds of its electricity, is
widely considered one of the most successful nuclear utilities.
   The main aim of the NRC's rule change was to ensure that
questions about the suitability of a nuclear reactor design, as
well as the plant's location, are answered before construction
begins.
   Lando W. Zech Jr., the NRC chairman, told the subcommittee the
new rule was ``a huge positive step'' toward reviving the nuclear
industry. He said the NRC had received no orders for new plants
since 1978, but that many new generating plants would be needed to
meet energy demands in the 1990s.
   ``The commission is confident that the final rule as presently
structured provides a sound basis for the efficient construction
and licensing of new, safe nuclear power plants,'' Zech said.
   Dean R. Tousley, speaking for the Union of Concerned Scientists,
told the panel that while his group favored speeding up the
licensing process, the NRC revisions go too far by limiting the
kinds of issues that can be raised after a plant is completed. He
said the rule meant only design and site issues could be raised.
   ``Where the commission runs adrift is in thinking that it can
resolve all construction-related issues prior to construction, and
deny a hearing on those issues at the end of construction,''
Tousley said.

<HEAD>Study Predicts 21 Percent F-14 Shortfall by End of '96</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense budget submitted to Congress last
month will leave the Navy short of F-14 jetfighters, according to a
congressman from the state where the aircraft are made.
   The Navy will have 110 fewer F-14 fighter planes than it needs
by 1996, Rep. George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., said Thursday in
releasing an analysis prepared for him by the Congressional
Research Service of the Library of Congress.
   ``No matter how you slice the Bush-Cheney budget, it comes up
dangerously short in Navy aircraft, the conventional weapons
America needs and uses in real life,'' Hochbrueckner said.
   The five-page report, described in its introduction as ``a
quick, rough analysis,'' concludes that the Navy will have 417 F-14
Tomcats at the end of fiscal 1996, 110 fewer than it has said it
will need. That equates to a 20.9 percent shortfall.
   The study assumes that there will be an increased demand for
F-14s as two aircraft carriers are converted from Midway airwings,
which carry no F-14s, to Roosevelt airwings, which carry 20 each.
The analysis also projects a loss of 70 F-14s during the period due
to peacetime accidents.
   The report is the latest weapon in a battle being waged by Long
Island's five congressmen to save the plane, manufactured by the
Grumman Corp. of Bethpage, N.Y.
   The F-14 was a casualty of the pared-down budget submitted last
month by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Cheney saved $360 million
in fiscal 1990 by canceling orders for 12 new F-14s.
   Cheney said the F14s are too expensive at a time when the
Pentagon has been ordered to cut $10 billion from its 1990 budget.
According to published reports and Navy calculations, the new
planes cost $75 million each.

<HEAD>White House Changes Course, Supports Efforts on Global Warming Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House has quickly reversed itself on
a major environmental problem and embraced the idea of a formal
treaty-negotiating process on global warming.
   The decision puts the United States in line with all other major
Western economies in supporting such an initiative.
   And the reversal occurs the same week a government scientist
testified the White House made him alter his testimony on the
``greenhouse effect'' to give the impression not everyone agreed on
the severity of the problem.
   The change of course was revealed in a cable dispatched Thursday
night to U.S. delegates at an environmental conference in Geneva
sponsored by the United Nations.
   Declaring it was essential for the United States to exercise a
leadership role, the cable said, ``We should seek to develop full
international consensus on necessary steps to prepare for a formal
treaty-negotiating process.''
   It proposed that U.S. delegates seek agreement for a ``global
warming workshop'' hosted this fall by the United States.
   The cable, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press,
was signed by White House chief of staff John Sununu, who only last
week earlier had rejected efforts to put the United States in the
lead in establishing an international convention on global warming.
   The convention idea had been supported by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator William K. Reilly.
   However, Sununu had argued that a convention was premature and
that more analysis was needed of economic and other effects of the
potentially dramatic actions needed against global warming,
officials said.
   Scientists believe that global temperatures could rise by 4
degrees or as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the
next century because increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other
manmade gases in the atmosphere will trap and retain heat from the
sun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse.
   Such a warming trend could melt polar ice caps and cause sea
levels to rise, cause severe droughts and storms and severely
disrupt the earth's biological systems.
   Scientists at a Senate hearing on Monday testified that the
problem might be worse than their own computer programs can predict.
   The White House had ordered one of the scientists, James E.
Hansen, director of National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Goddard Institute for Space Studies, to change his testimony to
avoid the impression ``that there is unanimity within the
government on this issue.''
   The hearing had put a sharp focus on the fact that the United
States was out of step with its allies on global warming.
   In his cable, Sununu said, ``We consider the reported emerging
agreement on an advanced preparatory program to address global
climate response issues comprehensively to be extremely positive.
   ``To further this process, please make every effort to obtain
agreement on a global warming workshop this fall, hosted by the
United States,'' Sununu said.
   He said such a meeting ``should be designed to identify the
scientific, legal, technical and economic issues critical to
further progress on beginning negotiations on an international
convention on global climate change.''
   While seeking consensus on steps for a treaty-negotiating
process, Sununu cautioned that ``because the size of the problem is
so large, improper or ill-advised actions could have enormous
unintended environmental, economic and social consequences.''
   Moreover, he said that the interests of developing nations must
be taken into account.
   Sununu said the proposed workshop ``should be structured to help
identify the elements that should be included in a framework
convention on global climate, as well as identifying key domestic
and economic policies of all countries that must be included in any
comprehensive process.''

<HEAD>Congress Gets $1.17 Trillion Federal Budget Next Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional budget writers say they expect
the House and Senate to give final approval next week to a $1.17
trillion spending plan for 1990 that claims a big deficit bite but
leaves most federal priorities unmolested.
   House-Senate negotiators agreed to the plan _ which claims a
$99.7 billion deficit reduction _ by a unanimous voice vote
Thursday after only two short days of public meetings. The few
disagreements the two chambers had were worked out behind closed
doors.
   ``I don't expect any problems,'' Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said when asked about the prospects
for approval on the floor of Congress.
   Democratic and Republican leaders have been working together
since the Bush administration and congressional leaders forged a
deal last month that settled most questions about spending levels
and how to achieve savings. On May 4, bipartisan majorities in the
House and Senate approved their own spending plans, which differed
little from each other.
   In reaching their compromise, the House agreed to the Senate's
higher spending totals for energy and commerce programs, while the
two chambers compromised on education, health, law enforcement, and
community development initiatives.
   One of the last disputes was resolved when the Senate agreed to
drop a provision that would have guaranteed $1.1 billion for public
housing subsidies. The decision will instead be left to Congress'
appropriations committees, which normally make most spending
choices.
   Middle ground was also found in the $28 billion the package
claims in deficit reduction for next year. The Senate agreed to
reduce the $2.7 billion in savings it sought from the Medicare
program to $2.3 billion, an amount expected to come from lowered
payments to doctors and hospitals.
   The makeup of $5.3 billion in additional tax receipts still must
be determined, a choice that is expected to be difficult. President
Bush says $4.8 billion of it can come from cutting the capital
gains tax, but Democrats say the plan is a handout to the wealthy
and a money-loser.
   Other fights are expected to be waged over a controversial
proposal to raise $250 million by having the government sell
broadcast rights and $400 million by licensing the production of
chloroflourocarbons, the chemicals blamed for depleting the Earth's
ozone layer.
   Battles will also be raised over about $3.5 billion worth of
undetermined savings expected to come from agriculture,
transportation, community development, health and other programs.
   In addition, out of $16.3 billion worth of savings that will
require changes in the law, the budget assigns only about half to
specified congressional committees for action. The budget simply
assumes that the rest of the savings will occur, an assumption that
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the Senate
Budget Committee, said causes ``a very serious credibility
problem.''
   The spending plan allows $299.2 billion in defense spending,
$4.2 billion less than the amount needed to keep up with inflation.
Another $17 billion would be spent on foreign aid. Both totals were
set in last month's budget pact between Bush and Congress.
   The budget has been savaged by critics who say it relies too
heavily on unrealistic economic assumptions that make the deficit
seem smaller and accounting gimmicks that create little real saving.
   The lawmakers claim $850 million in savings by moving some
payments for farmers from 1990 to this year, and $200 million in
savings because of the ``off-budget'' plan the Bush administration
prefers for rescuing the nation's ailing savings and loan
institutions.
   The claimed $99.7 billion shortfall allows Congress to claim to
have met the $100 billion deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman
law for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's
announcement on Panama and his news conference Thursday.
   The people of Latin America and the Caribbean have sacrificed,
fought and died to establish democracy.
   Today, elected constitional government is the clear choice of
the vast majority of the people of the Americas and the days of the
dictator are over.
   Still, in many parts of our hemisphere, the enemies of democracy
lie in wait to overturn elected governments through force or to
steal elections through fraud.
   All nations in the democratic community have a responsibility to
make it clear, through our actions and our words, that efforts to
overturn constitutional regimes or steal elections are unacceptable.
   If we fail to send a clear signal when democracy is imperiled,
the enemies of constitutional government will become more dangerous.
   And that's why events in Panama place an enormous responsibility
on all nations in the democratic community.
   This past week the people of Panama, in record numbers, voted to
elect a new democratic leadership of their country.
   And they voted to replace the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel
Noriega.
   The whole world was watching.
   Every credible observer, the Catholic church, Latin and European
observers, leaders of our Congress and two former presidents of the
United States tell the same story: the opposition won.
   It was not even a close election.
   The opposition won by a margin of nearly three to one.
   The Noriega regime first tried to steal this election through
massive fraud and intimidation, and now has nullified the election
and resorted to violence and bloodshed.
   In recenty days, a host of Latin American leaders have condemned
this election fraud.
   They've called on General Noriega to heed the will of the people
of Panama.
   We support and second those demands.
   The United States will not recognize nor accommodate with a
regime that holds power through force and violence at the expense
of the Panamanian people's right to be free.
   I've exchanged these views over the last several days with
democratic leaders in Latin America and in Europe.
   These consultations will continue.
   The crisis in Panama is a conflict between Noriega and the
people of Panama.
   The United States stands with the Panamanian people.
   We share their hope that the Panamanian defense forces will
stand with them and fulfill their constitutional obligation to
defend democracy.
   A professional Panamanian defense force can have an important
role to play in Panama's democratic future.
   The United States is committed to democracy in Panama.
   We respect the sovereignty of Panama and, of course, we have
great affection for the Panamanian people.
   We are also committed to protect the lives of our citizens.

   And we're committed to the integrity of the Panama Canal
treaties, which guarantee safe passage for all nations through the
canal.
   The Panama Canal treaties are a proud symbol of respect and
partnership between the people of the United States and the people
of Panama.
   In support of these objectives and after consulting this morning
with bipartisan leadership of the Congress, I'm taking the
following steps:
   First, the United States strongly supports and will cooperate
with initiatives taken by governments in this hemisphere to address
this crisis through regional diplomacy and action in the
Organization of American States and through other means.
   Second, our ambassador in Panama, Arthur Davis, has been
recalled and our our embassy staff will be reduced to essential
personnel only.
   Third, U.S. government employees and their dependents living
outside of U.S. military bases or Panama Canal Commission housing
areas will be relocated out of Panama or to secure U.S. housing
areas within Panama. This action will begin immediately. It will be
completed as quickly and in an orderly a manner as possible.
   Fourth, the State Department, through its travel advisory, will
encourage U.S. business representatives resident in Panama to
arrange for the extended absences of their dependents wherever
possible.
   Fifth, economic sanctions will continue in force.
   Sixth, the United States will carry out its obligations and will
assert and enforce its treaty rights in Panama under the Panama
Canal treaties.
   And, finally, we're sending a brigade-size force to Panama to
augment our military forces already assigned there.
   If required, I do not rule out further steps in the future.
   The United States and all democratic nations in this hemisphere
hope that peaceful resolution can be found to the crisis in Panama.
   And we urge all those in Panama _ every individual, every
institution _ to put the well-being of their country first and seek
an honorable solution to this crisis.
   The way is still open.
   Thank you. God bless.
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. Helen?
   Q. Are you willing to drop the drug charges against Noriega if
it will mean that he will leave the country or at least give up
control in a quid pro quo?
   A. No.
   Q. Mr. President, do you recognize Mr. Endara as the
president-elect, and what steps should the United States take to
help them get inaugurated?
   A. We have not made any formal recognition determination at this
point.
   Q. Mr. President, we understand that you've been trying to _
   A. We have been talking to our other countries in the hemisphere
on that point, I might add, Terry, but we have made no further _ no
official determination.
   Q. We understand you've been trying today, sir, to get other
leaders in the hemisphere to agree on a joint statement of
condemnation of Noriega, and I wondered if you can give us a
progress report on that diplomatic effort?
   A. Well, one, I have not, by joint statement, encouraged a joint
statement in which the United States would participate.
   Some of the leaders in this hemisphere are working on getting a
joint statement.
   And, indeed, I'm told authoritatively that there might be a
joint statement out of some European countries.
   But we would encourage countries in this hemisphere to either
jointly, or personally, make strong statements.
   And I believe that I want to say 10 countries have already made
individual statements.
   And now, I think the next collective diplomatic action is going
to be at the OAS.

   Q. Mr. President, sir, how many troops will that be? And will
they be quartered in the military compounds? Will they stay there
quietly and just be there, or will they be out on the streets
patroling?
   A. We will assert our treaty rights, enforce our treaty rights.
   And I will refer _ I will let General Scowcroft answer the
question.
   But my estimate of the troops would be about 2,000.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, why _ what is your justification for sending
the brigade of troops? What are you worried about?
   A. I'm worried about the lives of American citizens, and I will
do what is necessary to protect the lives of American citizens.
   And we will not be intimidated by the bullying tactics, brutal
though they may be, of the dictator Noriega.
   Q. Mr. President, your statement just now about defense forces,
would that be a signal that the United States would look favorably
on a coup attempt?
   A. I've asserted what my interest is at this point _ it is
democracy in Panama, it is protection of the life of Americans in
Panama.
   I'm going to take two more and then I'm going to go.
   Right here, and here on the aisle.
   Q. Sir, we've been calling around these Latin American
embassies. We find no enthusiasm for the dispatch of American
troops there. And the Mexican Embassy even said that they warned
against intervention. Are you disappointed with the reaction you're
getting from the Latin Americans?
   A. We've had good reactions from the Latin Americans.
   I haven't talked to them on that particular point but we have
had very good reactions from them.
   And I've been impressed with what the role of several of the
Latin American leaders _ I think, for the first time, there is a
total understanding on their part of the threat to democracy from
the stealing of this election or the threat to democracy in the
hemisphere from totalitarianism.
   And it's brought home by this theft of the election.
   So, they don't _ and I might add, on the troops _ I have a
profound obligation and that is _ as commander in chief of the
armed forces and as president, and that is to protect American life.
   And I'm going to do what is prudent and necessary to do this.
   And so we have a different obligation.
   We also have certain treaty rights and obligations.
   I'm prepared to fulfill our treaty obligations and I am prepared
to see that our treaty rights are exercised.
   And _ I'd leave it right there in terms of the troop deployments.
   Last one.
   Q. Mr. President, in the Reagan administration there was a very
formal negotiating process with General Noriega over terms under
which he might leave. Is there any possibility that that might
repeat itself now _ that there might be some sort of formal
discussions between yourselves and the Panamanian government and
General Noriega about conditions under which he might leave?
   A. Oh, he knows my position on the fact that, if he does leave,
we would have the instant restoration of normal relations with
Panama _ that has been conveyed to him very, very recently.
   But look, I will be open-minded about seeing what it might take
to see him leave.
   I'm not going to go back and do what Helen asked about in
dropping these indictments.
   I'm not going to do that.
   It has _ that has profound implications for our fight against
narcotics, which is _ has got to be worldwide.
   But if there's something short of that, the door's open to
understand what it is that would be required.
   But I don't think he's _ the Panamanian people should be asked
to compromise in terms of their election, which was won
three-to-one by those opposed to Noriega.
   So there'd be certain things, other non-negotiable things, but I
don't think that _ that's between Noriega and the Panamanian people.
   Thank you all very much, and Brent will take your remaining
questions.
   Q. How is Endara? Is he in the hospital?
   Bush: He was out and then I think he's back in.
   But now I don't know whether he's gotten out later on or not.
   Q. Is Noriega capable taking hostages, sir?
   Q. What about Ford?
   Q. Have you made contact with him?
   Q. Are you concerned about him taking hostages?
   Bush: I'm concerned about protecting the lives of Americans and
that's exactly why I've taken the actions that I have here today.

<HEAD>President Completes First 100 Days Despite Deaths, Looming Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAROLD OLMOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Andres Perez marked
his first 100 days in office today on an ominous note _ unions set
a strike date to protest austerity measures ordered by the
International Monetary Fund. Similar protests last winter sparked
clashes that left nearly 300 Venezuelans dead.
   If the first nationwide strike in 31 years of democratic rule
goes off as scheduled next Thursday, it would underscore the social
democratic leader's difficulties in convincing Venezuelans that his
program will lift this oil-producing nation out of its economic
doldrums.
   Leaders of the powerful Venezuelan Workers Confederation have
vowed to bring the country to a standstill with the strike, saying
a massive work stoppage would force Perez ``to twist and rectify''
his controversial plan.
   The elimination overnight of a number of subsidies that for
years kept prices down triggered a wave of violence in Caracas and
the deaths of at least 276 people in late February and early March.
The elimination of subsidies on basic commodities had been
advocated by the IMF.
   While the violence caused no reshufflings of the Perez
administration, it did expose the radical changes that have
occurred in Venezuela _ a model of stability in Latin America _
since he was first president from 1973-78, when the country was
rich with petrodollars.
   The bonanza of those years helped Perez easily win a second term
in December elections and he begin his new government with a
festive ceremony that featured 20 presidents, heads of state and a
special U.S. delegation presided over by Vice-President Quayle.
   But the enthusiasm soon faded, overwhelmed by crushing economic
realities.
   Inflation during the first four months of the year was 39
percent, and about 15 percent of the labor force of 5.8 millions is
jobless _ almost double that of last year.
   The government too is still far from an agreement with foreign
banks on measures to help alleviate its foreign debt.
   Perez meanwhile has launched a campaign to gain funds from
private institutions and, if successful, news reports say he would
increase his nation's debt from an already high $33 billion to $50
billion by 1994, when his term ends.
   Banks, however, have been reluctant to grant fresh money to
Venezuela.
   ``It is hard to come to terms easily with somebody who is asking
a debt reduction with one hand and with the other asking for more
loans,'' said one foreign banker.
   The debt is among the strike's targets, but it is not clear yet
if the unions will ask the government to declare a unilateral
moratorium, which Perez has consistently rejected, or reiterate
demands for better terms of repayment.
   Private business leaders have condemned the strike, saying it
will cause $300 million in production losses, something the country
can ill-afford.

<HEAD>Bush Set to Make Semiautomatic Ban Permanent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's assault on crime will include
a further assault on combat-style semiautomatic weapons and the
criminals who use them, administration sources say.
   According to the sources, Bush will make permanent his ban on
importation of the semiautomatic weapons that are modeled after
their fully automatic military assault rifles and machine pistols.
   Gun control opponents in Congress and members of the National
Rifle Association have strongly urged against a semiautomatic ban
because it might be used by gun opponents to push for stiffer
restrictions on all types of guns.
   The gun ban was initially imposed in mid-March while the
government reviewed the uses of the weapons, and is part of an
anti-crime package Bush will unveil in a speech Monday.
   Bush has not approved the final package. But it is expected to
include more money for prisons, stiffer sentencing requirements for
criminals who use guns, and more money for law enforcement in
general, including additional agents for the Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   When Bush ordered the initial ban, he also asked BATF to study
the suitability of the weapons for sporting purposes.
   Current law requires that such weapons can only be brought into
the country if they are to be used for sport. The Bush
administration initiated the suspension when public outcry mounted
against street crimes in which such weapons were used.
   The guns were increasingly used in drug-related shootings and
after the Jan. 17 killing of five youngsters at a Stockton, Calif.,
by a man who used a semiautomatic.
   Several administration officials want Bush to extend the ban on
imports to cover domestically manufactured weapons that are very
similar to the foreign models.
   But the president's plan, in its preliminary stages, did not
include such a measure, the officials said. It was unclear how he
would deal with the suitability-for-sports question in deciding on
that aspect.
   BATF is conducting a survey to determine the sports adaptability
of the weapons. The agency has sent out questionnaires to hundreds
of organizations, state fish and wildlife commissions, shooting
clubs, gun owners and dealers to learn whether the semiautomatics
are being used for hunting purposes.
   The agency's report to Bush, dealing with the uses of such
weapons as well as recommendations from a political standpoint, is
not expected to be complete before mid-June.
   However, sources said Bush will deal with the issue before
obtaining that review, since he will be disclosing other components
of his crime package.
   The review will deal with the sticky problem of determining
which of the weapons, some of which are distinguished only by their
appearance and trappings but not their firepower, are for sporting.
   Bush is expected to announce his plan Monday in a Washington
speech to the National Fraternal Order of Police.
   Among the provisions he is expected to approve are an increase
in the mandatory federal sentence for crimes involving use of a
gun, and stiffer penalties for crimes involving assault-style
weapons.
   Bush promised during his campaign last year to back tougher
sentencing and also called for doubling of the federal prison
budget over four years, adding $250 million each year.
   He also called for conversion of unneeded military bases into
state and federal prisons, and said money captured from drug
dealers and racketeers should be used to pay for the prisons.

<HEAD>Secord Sees New Indictment as `Senseless ... Vindictive'</HEAD>

   Richard Secord, the retired officer who ran
arms to the Nicaraguan Contras, lied to Congress in his testimony
on the Iran-Contra scandal and covered up more than $1 million in
personal profits, a second indictment against him alleges.
   Secord, enlisted by Oliver North in the Contra arms supply
network, said the nine-count indictment unsealed Thursday shows the
weakness of the government's original case and is ``a senseless
attempt to secure a conviction.''
   The retired Air Force major general was originally indicted on
six criminal charges in March 1988.
   ``The decision to indict again is vindictive and contrary to any
notion of fair play and professionalism,'' Secord's lawyers said in
a statement. The three-page statement, issued by the Washington law
firm of Sharp, Green &amp; Lankford, also asked for financial
assistance from the public to help pay for Secord's defense.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh ``has seen his so-called
`conspiracy case' eviscerated by court rulings and most recently by
a jury's verdict,'' said Secord's lawyers.
   North, who was indicted with Secord in March 1988, was convicted
last week of three of 12 criminal charges against him. Conspiracy
and theft counts against the former White House aide were dropped
Jan. 13 due to national security concerns.
   The new indictment against Secord was returned April 7 by a
federal grand jury investigating possible perjury by Iran-Contra
figures. It was kept sealed to avoid bringing it out during North's
trial.
   Secord was the lead witness in the televised hearings conducted
in the spring and summer of 1987 by the House and Senate
committees. He testified without immunity from prosecution before
the congressional panels.
   The new charges include seven counts of perjury in connection
with his congressional testimony to Congress and one count of
obstructing Congress' ran-Contra committees. Secord also is accused
of making false statements to congressional staffers about a
$200,000 educational benefit for North's children and a $13,800
security system Secord paid for at North's home.
   Secord faces a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment and
$250,000 in fines on each count if convicted.
   The false statement charge accuses Secord, 56, of denying to
lawyers for the congressional Iran-Contra panels that he was aware
of any money from the Iran-Contra transactions that went to benefit
North.
   The indictment alleges that Secord used former Internal Revenue
Service lawyer Willard Zucker, who was granted immunity from
prosecution and testified at North's recent trial, to hide large
sums that he diverted to his personal use.
   The money came from more than $47 million that Zucker, based in
Switzerland, moved through Swiss bank accounts for Secord and
business partner Albert Hakim, the indictment said. The accounts
were part of an enterprise made up of a clandestine network of
foreign corporations, the indictment said.
   Secord lied to Congress by saying that his only profits from
arms sales to the Contras and Iran came from his $6,000 monthly
salary, the government alleged.
   Zucker testified at the North trial that in 1986, $28.6 million
was funneled through Swiss bank accounts used in the Iran-Contra
affair by Secord and Hakim. One $9,000 draft, testified Zucker, was
partial payment for North's security system. North was convicted of
accepting an illegal gratuity from Secord in connection with the
system.
   Zucker wasn't permitted to testify in detail at North's trial
about the $200,000 death benefit for North's children because North
wasn't tried on that matter. But prosecutors said Zucker would have
testified that he set aside $200,000 and that the money is now in
an account earning interest.
   Secord was indicted in March 1988 along with North, Hakim and
North's ex-boss, former national security adviser John Poindexter.
The heart of that indictment was that the four men conspired to
illegally divert profits from the Iran arms sales to the Contras.
   Other charges against Secord in the original indictment are
theft of government property, wire fraud, conspiracy to pay illegal
gratuities, the offer of an illegal gratuity and payment of an
illegal gratuity. The gratuities charges involve the security
system and the death benefit.
   In a separate legal matter, Secord was convicted in the Fairfax
County, Va., General District Court of drunken driving. The
prosecution said Secord's blood alcohol level was 0.20, twice the
legal limit, when he was arrested Feb. 26. He was fined $200 and
ordered to enter an alcohol safety program.
   Secord's lawyer said an appeal was planned.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Same Gene In Both Breast And Ovarian Cancers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers report in a study published today
that a gene previously linked to breast cancer also can also be
found in ovarian tumors.
   The study, published today in the journal Science, suggests that
testing for the presence of the gene may provide a way of tailoring
cancer treatment to the precise needs of a patient.
   In a cooperative study by seven laboratories, researchers found
that a specific cancer-related gene, called the HER-2@neu oncogene,
was present in tumors of both the breasts and the ovaries.
   An analysis of samples from 668 breast tumors and 120 ovarian
tumors also showed that the oncogene was actively producing a
protein within the tumors, suggesting that the gene plays an
important role in the disease process.
   Dr. Michael Press, a University of Southern California
researcher who participated in the study, said the finding raises
the possibility that diagnostic tests to detect the gene in breast
and ovarian cancers could help doctors determine the precise level
of treatment required by each patient.
   Earlier studies showed that the numbers of HER-2@neu oncogenes
in a breast tumor could predict the outcome of a specific disease.
An amplification, or elevated number, of the oncogenes lead to a
quicker relapse and a shorter period of survival of breast cancer
patients.
   Finding the oncogene in ovarian cancers, said Press, may give
clinicians a predictor of the disease progress in these patients
also.
   ``This gene might be a way of identifying patients who would
have a less favorable clinical outcome,'' he said. ``If one could
identify such patients, then they could be singled out for more
aggressive therapy.''
   This would be particularly important for ovarian cancers. Press
said doctors now can gauge the level of treatment for breast cancer
patients based on whether or not cancer cells are found in nearby
lymph nodes. There currently is no such prognostic indicator for
ovarian cancer, he said.
   The exact role that HEF-2@neu plays in development of cancer
tumors is not understood. But Press said it clearly is an oncogene,
a genetic molecule with a normal function that is changed or
activated in some way to become part of the cancer disease process.
   ``Why that is and what the gene does is unknown at this point,''
said Press. ``We're assuming that the gene is important because it
codes for a protein, but we don't know what the function of that
protein is.''
   Press said the researchers looked unsuccessfully for the same
oncogene in tumors from cancers of the lung, adrenal gland and
colon.
   The researchers also did a statistical study to relate
amplification, or the numbers of the oncogene present in a tumor,
with the outcome of the disease.
   Press said the results show that the greater the amplification,
the poorer the prognosis.
   With ovarian cancer patients having only one copy of the
oncogene in tumor cells, the median survival time was 1,879 days.
For patients with a two- to a five-fold amplification, the median
survival was 959 days. Those with a greater than five-fold
amplification had a median survival of only 243 days. A similar
pattern was shown earlier among breast cancer patients.
   Breast and ovarian cancers account for one-third, or about
162,000, of all the cancers diagnosed annually in American women.
These types of cancers account for about 25 percent of all cancer
deaths in women.
   Co-investigators with Press in the study were Judith Udove of
USC; William Godolphin of the Vancouver General Hospital, Canada;
Lovell Jones, M.D., of Anderson Hospital, Houston; John Holt of the
University of Chicago Medical Center; Steven Wong, Duane Keith and
Wendy Level of UCLA; Susan Stuart at Triton Biosciences, Alameda,
Calif., and Axel Ullrich of Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.

   Pfc. Greg Rieth admitted
being nervous as he got ready to leave for Panama with about 900
troops of the Army's 7th Light Infantry Division.
   ``Sure, yeah, I'm scared, but I'll do what needs to be done,''
said Rieth, a Cleveland native who wore camouflage fatigues and
face paint. ``We need to clean up the streets.''
   The soldiers were scheduled to begin departing at sunrise today.
They're part of the 2,000 combat troops President Bush is sending
to the Central American nation to augment the 10,000 troops already
stationed there.
   Bush said the deployment is intended to protect the lives of
Americans following bloody post-election attacks on opposition
leaders by supporters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The president also ordered all U.S. government employees and
their dependents living off military bases in Panama to be
relocated onto U.S. bases or to return to the United States.
   The 7th Division troops waved and smiled to reporters and
photographers as they left Fort Ord, about 100 miles south of San
Francisco, by truck and bus convoy. They began arriving at Travis,
about 35 miles northeast of San Francisco, Thursday night.
   The group includes about 100 cooks, medics and other support
personnel.
   A mother and daughter waited for the convoy outside the Travis
gate holding cardboard signs that read: ``Good Luck'' and ``Hurry
Home.''
   Linda Sexson, 43, whose son is a submarine crewman based on the
East Coast, said she came ``because I'm a mother with a son in the
service and I just came out to say goodbye and good luck.''
   ``Having someone in the service makes you think about what
they're doing. It makes you feel it a little more personally,''
said her daughter, 19-year-old Nicole Fisher.
   The division, known as the Bayonet Division, is part of a highly
mobile outfit that carries most of its equipment on its back and is
designed for quick deployment anywhere in the world.
   Other military units being deployed include one battalion of the
Army's 5th Infantry Division at Fort Polk, La., and one company
from the Second Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
   Fort Ord officials got the deployment orders about
three-quarters of the way through the president's news conference
Thursday, said Army spokesman Jim Davis. They were not unexpected,
he said. ``When you're a rapid deployment force, you pay attention
to what's going on.''
   More than 1,100 Fort Ord soldiers were sent to Honduras on March
17, 1988, after the reported movement of Nicaraguan troops into
Honduras. They returned shortly afterward. In April of last year,
26 U.S. Army helicopters and 200 aviators and other workers were
sent to Panama to bolster protection of U.S. citizens.
   The 7th Light contingent being sent today includes one battalion
of light infantry, one battery _ or company _ of light field
artillery and one headquarters brigade, said a military spokesman.
   Fort Ord was placed on alert Wednesday evening and is capable of
dispatching soldiers within 18 hours of such an alert, officials
said.
   Many soldiers had time to notify their families, Davis said.
And, he said, a family support group met after the deployment began
and set up a telephone network to keep relatives informed of
developments.
   ``The wives become pros and they know to get ready for that,''
he said.
   Still, emotions were running high as the troops were moved out.
   Elizabeth Shepherd, asked how she felt about her husband's
departure, replied: ``Scared, because I'm stuck here with the kids
and I don't know what's going on.''

<HEAD>Clouds May Indeed Have Silver Lining in Countering Greenhouse Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

   Clouds could prove to be a built-in thermostat
for the Earth, cooling things down to counter the threatened
greenhouse warming, a group of scientists report.
   But while researchers attending a meeting of the American
Geophysical Union agreed Thursday that such a balancing is
possible, they refused to predict that it will actually take place.
   ``Lets be very careful about that. We don't know that, as the
climate warms up with the greenhouse effect, these clouds are going
to increase and compensate for it...don't jump to any
conclusions,'' cautioned Bruce A. Albrecht of Penn State University.
   The threat of rising temperatures has attracted considerable
attention recently. Many climatologists worry that increasing
levels of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere will
raise the planet's average temperature by trapping excess heat from
the sun that would ordinarily be radiated back into space.
   The panel of scientists reporting early results from an
international cloud research project said they found that some
clouds add to the greenhouse warming while others reduce it. Even a
small change in the amount of cloud cover can have a major impact,
they said.
   The apparently helpful clouds are the stratocumulus, large decks
of white clouds that form at relatively low levels in the
atmosphere and are widely seen, especially over the oceans.
   ``The way these clouds work, they are highly reflective in the
short wave but they have very little effect on the long-wave
radiation,'' Albrecht explained. Thus, short-wave radiation
arriving from the sun that would ordinarily warm the surface of the
planet gets reflected back out into space, while long-wave
radiation cooling the earth isn't blocked from leaving.
   The clouds' effectiveness increases if they contain more water
or if they consist of smaller droplets, the researchers said.
   ``If the climate warms and the amount of liquid water in the
cloud increases, that can lead to more reflecting clouds. More
reflecting clouds means that the total amount of energy available
to the Earth's energy system is reduced,'' explained Tony Slingo of
the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
   ``That acts as a thermostat, bringing the climate back into
equilibrium,'' he said.
   ``The sensitivity of climate to clouds is so enormous that you
really need only very modest changes in particle size and you can
wipe out the (carbon dioxide) warming. Now, whether those process
really are operating and they really are wiping out the ...
warming'' remains a question, he added.
   While he, too, was cautious about predicting what will happen,
Penn State's Albrecht agreed that the stratocumulus clouds can have
a major effect on cooling the atmosphere.
   ``The number that we toss around ... if you increase the amount
of stratocumulus by 4 percent'' that would be enough to compensate
for a doubling of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,'' he said.
   On the other hand, cirrus clouds, those high wispy ones that are
hard to see, actually add warmth to the Earth by trapping heat from
the sun in much the same way that carbon dioxide and other
so-called Greenhouse gases do, explained David Starr of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   These clouds are the most common type, covering 25 percent to 40
percent of the Earth's surface, Starr said.
   ``The importance of cirrus clouds to climate is similar to that
of the greenhouse gases,'' added Howard Hanson of the University of
Colorado at Boulder.
   Recent cloud studies have convinced researchers that the effects
of clouds are much more complex than they had previously thought,
Hanson said.
   Cirrus clouds are not well understood and are difficult to
study, Starr said, although scientists are trying to learn more.
   Government and scientific attention to the theory of greenhouse
warming has been widespread. Some researchers warn that rising
temperatures could severely disrupt climate and weather, change
crop yields and even cause coastal flooding by melting the polar
ice caps.
   Some reports have indicated a slight rise in average
temperatures over the last century, a time when industrialization
has added large amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.

<HEAD>An End To Panama Canal Treaties Would End A Special Relationship</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dispute over the Panama Canal
treaties threatens the special relationship that Panama and the
United States have enjoyed since the Central American nation's
birth.
   This week's annullment of Panama's presidential elections have
focused new attention on the treaties that allow the U.S.
government to operate the canal and nearby military bases, but say
it must turn relinquish control of the canal and pull out its
troops by the end of the century.
   Cancellation of those treaties was one measure U.S. legislators
suggested Thursday after President Bush announced he would send
nearly 1,900 troops to augment the 10,000 servicemen already
stationed in Panama.
   The troops are part of an effort to force out Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who the U.S. government says rigged the elections
and was behind attacks by his supporters on the opposition
presidential and vice presidential candidates.
   Noreiga, the country's de facto ruler since 1983, has said the
U.S. government plans to renege on the treaties.
   Panama's relationship with the United States dates to 1903, the
year it seceded from neighboring Colombia with President Theodore
Roosevelt's help.
   That same year, the two countries signed a treaty to construct a
50-mile canal across the narrow isthmus connecting the Pacific and
Atlantic oceans.
   The canal, designed to save ships the long voyage around the
southern tip of South America, was inaugurated in 1914.
   In subsequent years, the United States built numerous military
installations along the canal and constructed a huge communications
network.
   That early treaty formed a U.S.-administered Canal Zone. While
Panama retained sovereignity in the area, the United States had
unilateral control over canal operations.
   The arrangement continued with minor modifications until 1977,
when President Jimmy Carter and dictator Gen. Omar Torrijos signed
a new set of treaties that said:
   _ The United States would relinquish canal administration to
Panama and pull out all its military installations in a gradual
process ending on Dec. 31, 1999.
   _ The United States would retain control of and have primary
responsibility for protecting and defending the canal until then.
   The treaties went into effect in 1979, when the United States
relinquished a bit of Americana known as the Canal Zone, along with
several military installations.
   Still, the Carter-Torrijos treaties included a clause allowing
the United States to station, train and transport military forces
in Panama.
   Many Panamanians worry that that clause could allow the United
States to pack the area with soldiers if it believes its control of
the canal is at stake.
   The Carter-Torrijos treaties said ``after the termination of the
Canal Treaty only Panama will administer the Canal and maintain
military forces, defense sites and military installations within
its national territory.''
   But the U.S. Congress approved the treaties, with an amendment
giving its government ``the right to act against any aggression or
threat aimed at the Canal or against the peaceful movement of
ships.''
   That amendment also said the two countries could make future
arrangements to allow a U.S. military presence in Panama by mutual
agreement.
   Noriega says the opposition, which claims victory in Sunday's
aborted elections, planned to give the United States that option.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. has recommended naming an
environmentalist to its board, but one of the nation's top wildlife
advocates emerged from a meeting with the company's chairman saying
Exxon was shirking its duties.
   ``They simply are looking at a short-term fix,'' National
Wildlife Federation President Jay D. Hair told reporters Thursday
after meeting with Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl and other
company officials.
   The oil company, bowing to pressure from pension funds holding
about $1 billion in the company's stock, announced earlier it would
establish a special committee on environmental matters that would
review corporate policies and programs related to worker safety and
the environment.
   In addition, Exxon said it would consider spending more money on
environmental research and pollution prevention. About $5.5 billion
has been spent on that from 1970 to 1988, the company said.
   The announcement comes about a week after a meeting between
Exxon management and representatives of New York City's pension
fund, a large shareholder.
   New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, who recommended
the changes Exxon plans to adopt, said he was pleased by Exxon's
announcement.
   ``It's a rather extraordinary development for a large American
company,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``We're pleased that
they have accepted our proposals, and it's clear that these ...
could go far in helping prevent a repeat of the Alaska disaster.''
   But Ed Rothschild, a spokesman for the Washington-based consumer
group Citizen Action, called the announcement nothing more than ``a
public relations window dressing'' that will do nothing concrete to
improve the environment.
   New York officials had said three city pension funds owning 6
million shares of Exxon stock would vote against company management
at the May 18 annual shareholders meeting if the company failed to
act on their recommendations.
   California's state employee pension fund, the nation's biggest,
had indicated that it might back the New York group.
   About 35 percent of Exxon's shares are owned by institutional
investors. The company has some 713,000 shareholders.
   Hair said Exxon's efforts to clean up the spill resulting from
the March 24 wreck of the tanker Exxon Valdez were ineffective and
the company had no long-term plans for restoring the delicate
balance of life in Prince William Sound.
   Hair said Rawl rejected several proposals designed to ``ensure
that Exxon is going to be there as long as it takes, no matter how
much it costs.''
   Among the federation's proposals was a plan for Exxon to
contribute $1 billion annually to an independent trust fund ``until
the total extent of the long-term economic and environmental
impacts to the Prince William Sound region have been objectively
determined.''
   Sarah Johnson, an Exxon spokeswoman, said the company believed
that such a trust fund ``would not be in the best interest of its
shareholders.''
   Fears that Exxon would abandon the region once the visible
effects of the spill are gone were unwarranted, she said.

<TEXT>
   A House panel weighing a report on alleged
mismanagement and contract abuse in a federal low-income housing
renovation program denounced aspects of the Housing Department's
probe.
   Members of the Banking and Finance subcommittee on housing and
community development on Thursday called Department of Housing and
Urban Development Inspector General Paul A. Adams to task for his
investigative methods, which turned up no evidence of criminal
wrongdoing.
   Democrats criticized Adams for waiting until a day before former
HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce was to leave the department to question
him.
   ``Why would you have waited ... until Jan. 19 of this year to
interview the HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, who was going out of
office the next day?'' asked Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, the
subcommittee's chairman. He noted the inspector general's probe had
begun almost a year earlier.
   ``This seems to be quite planned,'' charged Gonzalez, calling
Adams ``derelict'' in waiting so long.
   Adams said the delay in interviewing Pierce ``was just a matter
of scheduling.''
   The subcommittee also criticized Adams for singling out for
culpability Thomas T. Demery, the former assistant secretary for
housing who was responsible for administration of the controversial
renovation program.
   Current Housing Secretary Jack Kemp two weeks ago suspended more
than $100 million in fiscal 1989 funding for low-income renovation
projects, saying Adams' investigation had uncovered a system that
``was undocumented, ignored existing standards and regulations, and
was based on the perception and reality of favoritism and abuse of
non-public information.''
   The inspector general reported that former housing appointees
and other government officials _ including former HUD
Undersecretary Philip Abrams, former Assistant Secretary for
Housing Philip Winn and former Sen. Edward Brooke, R-Mass. _ used
the system to win lucrative consultant contracts with public
housing authorities and developers.
   But the report found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the
investigation, which covered activities in the HUD Section 8
Moderate Rehabilitation Program from January 1984 through November
1988.
   Gonzalez asked why Adams made no ``specific recommendations
regarding possible violations of law'' by former HUD officials.
   Adams said his office had consulted with the Justice Department
throughout the investigation and found no evidence that criminal
statutes had been violated.
   ``I find a disturbing indication in the documents that because
these allocation formulas and the laws that pertain to HUD are not
criminal statutes, that the conspiracies that go on here of
individuals working together in order to go around established
procedures are treated as if they are not criminal matters,'' said
Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn.
   Adams said the Justice Department is reviewing the report.
   Adams and Demery, appearing for the second time this week before
a congressional panel, described to the subcommittee their roles in
the program and the subsequent investigation into its selection and
allocation process.
   Demery insisted, as he had earlier, he shared with other HUD
officials concern about the ``discretionary'' nature of Pierce's
funding decisions in the program soon after his appointment in
October 1986.
   Demery said as a result of his persistence, a selection
committee was set up in January 1987, but Pierce retained final
approval over its recommendations.
   Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., warned that the inspector
general's conclusions might ``compromise'' any future investigation.
   Rep. Marci Kaptur, D-Ohio, indicated she might request that a
special prosecutor investigate the program.
   ``I don't really hear legal reasoning, I hear administrative
reasoning'' in the inspector general's conclusions, she said.
   Other Democrats on the panel also questioned Adams and Demery
about how the congressionally mandated ``fair share'' allocations
to the states and regulations for public notice of competitive
bidding for contracts were circumvented.
   Peter Pretorius, the founder of Food for Africa, a favored
charity of Demery's, made a surprise appearance. Adam's report
indicated that Food had received large donations from several
developers that won contracts to renovate housing under the federal
rehabilitation program.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reye's syndrome cases have fallen dramatically in
nine years as a result of warnings about the links between aspirin
and the childhood disease, federal health researchers say.
   Just 20 cases of Reye's syndrome were reported in 1988, the
national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday. At its peak
in 1980, Reye's syndrome afflicted 555 people.
   The 1988 count is the lowest since national surveillance of
Reye's cases was begun in 1976, the CDC said.
   The disease struck 101 Americans in 1986, the year in which
aspirin containers were first required to carry warnings about it.
Only 36 cases were reported in 1987, the CDC said.
   The ailment, first observed in the 1950s, causes severe vomiting
and lethargy and can result in coma and death. It usually occurs in
children and is generally preceded by a bout with a viral illness
such as influenza or chicken pox.
   Researchers have documented a link between the use of aspirin by
young patients during chicken pox or flu and the subsequent
development of Reye's syndrome.
   ``The decline in the number of RS cases since late 1980
coincides with the increased publicity about this association,''
the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   ``Study after study shows aspirin is the primary cause of Reye's
syndrome,'' said Dr. Larry Schonberger, a CDC researcher, who
termed the 1988 count ``shockingly low'' compared with previous
levels.
   At least 10 of the 36 patients in 1987 died. In 1988, five of 17
patients for whom the outcome is known died.
   Nine of the 20 reported Reye's syndrome patients in 1988 had
suffered respiratory illness such as flu before the onset of the
Reye's; four had chicken pox. The previous year, 18 of the 36
patients had respiratory illnesses, and seven had chicken pox.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was released from
Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital today after undergoing two days of
tests following complaints of fatigue, Shamir's office said.
   ``Mr. Shamir is feeling well and is in excellent mood. He will
rest at home during the weekend and will return to work Sunday,'' a
spokeswoman at prime minister's office said.
   Officials at Haddasah confirmed that Shamir, 73, intended to
attend a crucial Cabinet debate on his Middle East peace plan.
   ``Our prime minister took us by surprise and decided to leave
(three hours) earlier than scheduled,'' hospital spokeswoman Ruth
Mekel said. ``I think he went first to his home. As far as I
understand, he resumes work Sunday and will attend the Cabinet
meeting.''
   Mrs. Mekel quoted Shamir's doctors as saying the premier's tests
were good and that his physical condition was ``excellent.''
However, neither she nor officials in Shamir's office would say
what tests he underwent or provide details of his illness.
   ``He only complained of fatigue,'' Mrs. Mekel said. ``He really
worked very hard after returning from abroad.''
   Shamir traveled to the United States in April to unveil his
peace plan, calling for elections among Palestinians living in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   Tuesday night, Shamir struck his head in a fall and complained
later he felt weak, according to his spokesman Yossi Ahimeir.
   However, during Israel's Independence Day celebrations, which
ran from Tuesday night to Wednesday night, Shamir appeared at a
half-dozen rallies.
   At the International Bible Quiz on Wednesday, he was wearing
dark glasses, with a large reddish welt visible on his right cheek.
   The lack of official comment on the nature of Shamir's illness
or what tests he was given prompted complaints by Israeli media.
They noted that illnesses of foreign leaders _ notably Americans _
usually brought detailed reports from government officials.

   Here is a look at actions announced by
President Bush in response to the turmoil in Panama.
   The president Thursday:
   _Ordered an additional 2,000 U.S. troops into Panama, on top of
the 10,000 already there, ``to protect the lives of American
citizens.'' More than 20,000 U.S. civilians, many of them retirees,
live in the Central American country.
   _Denounced the regime of Panamanian military leader Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega and said he is recalling U.S. ambassador Arthur
Davis. Bush said the embassy staff also will be reduced.
   _Directed that U.S. government employees and their dependents
living outside of military bases be returned to the United States
or relocated to the bases along the Panama Canal.
   _Said the United States will support moves in the Organization
of American States and elsewhere to condemn Noriega.
   _Said the State Department will encourage representatives of
U.S. businesses operating in Panama to arrange for ``extended
absences'' of their dependents from the country.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's decision to order more U.S.
troops into Panama and evacuate some American dependents in the
wake of aborted elections and the beating of opposition leaders is
another benchmark in the two-year slide in relations between the
two nations.
   Twenty-five years ago, the United States and Panama actually
broke off diplomatic ties, temporarily, following anti-American
riots. But the more recent government of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, himself charged in the United States with drug
trafficking, has caused even more frustration and anger in
Washington.
   Here is a chronology of key events related to the Noriega regime:
   June 1987 _ Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, the retiring
second-in-command of the Defense Forces, accuses Noriega of
drug-related activities, of rigging the 1984 election in favor of
government candidates, and of murdering Dr. Hugo Spadafora, a
former vice minister of health who had accused Noriega of drug
trafficking.
   June 9, 1987 _ A protest movement headed by the National Civic
Crusade, a grouping of professionals and students, demands a probe
into Herrera's allegations and a return to democracy. Street
protests are crushed brutally.
   Feb. 4, 1988 _ A federal grand jury in Miami indicts Noriega on
drug-  running charges. A grand jury in Tampa returns similar
indictments.
   Feb. 25, 1988 _ President Eric Delvalle, who was put in place by
Noriega, announces he has fired his patron. Eight hours later, the
National Assembly meets, ousts Delvalle and names Manuel Solis
Palma as minister in charge of the presidency, a title he retains.
The United States refuses to recognize Solis Palma. The government
closes opposition news media.
   March 16, 1988 _ A coup organized by Defense Forces officers
against Noriega fails. Demonstrations erupt in the capital and a
power outage blacks out the nation.
   March 28, 1988 _ After a large anti-Noriega march, members of
the Defense Forces enter the Marriott Hotel, beating and arresting
journalists and opposition leaders.
   April 9, 1988 _ The United States announces economic sanctions
that prohibit American companies and the government from making
payments to the Panamanian government. Some $56 million in
Panamanian funds in American banks are frozen. The United States
tries to negotiate the departure of Noriega without success.
   May 9, 1988 _ Banks reopen but with severe restrictions,
including a freeze on savings accounts.
   Aug. 21, 1988 _ The United States charges there were more than
240 cases of harassment of American military personnel by
Panamanian authorities so far that year.
   Sept. 13, 1988 _ The U.S. Defense Department reduces the tour of
duty for soldiers stationed in Panama to lower the number of
dependents in the country.
   Oct. 30, 1988 _ Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
Affairs Elliott Abrams admits the Reagan administration's efforts
to oust Noriega have failed.
   April 9, 1989 _ Economic sanctions are renewed for one year on
the basis that Washington considers Panama a threat to American
security.
   April and May 1989 _ The United States accuses Panama of
planning to win May 7 presidential elections by fraud. News reports
contend the United States authorized $10 million for the Panamanian
opposition, which becomes a major campaign issue.
   May 7-9, 1989 _ The elections are held, but Noriega's victory
claim is countered by rioters as well as international observers
who say the ballots were rigged. Former President Carter, one of
the U.S. observers, storms out of Panama's vote tabulation center
and denounces Noriega as a dictator who was stealing the election.
The protest is echoed in Congress and at the White House, which
says independent exit polling showed Noriega's slate was losing by
a 3-to-1 margin. One senator introduces legislation calling for
abrogation of the Panama Canal treaties, but the White House
rejects that approach.
   May 10, 1989 _ As defense forces look on, thugs loyal to Noriega
beat opposition candidate Guillermo Endara and his two running
mates, and one of their bodyguards is killed. The
Noriega-controlled Electoral Tribunal declares the elections null
and void ``in their totality.'' But ``We won and we will continue
to fight,'' says Guillermo Ford, the bloodied second vice
presidential candidate.
   May 11, 1989 _ President Bush orders 2,000 additional U.S.
military troops to Panama, joining 10,000 already there and decides
to evacuate more of the American dependents there. Some of the
dependents will be sent home, others moved to military bases for
safety.

   The Army battalions on their way to Panama
include one from a ``light'' division organized for quick movement
around the world and one from a standard mechanized division that
trains to fight with personnel carriers and tanks.
   The one company from the 2nd Marine Division, meantime, is the
first to deploy on a real-world mission in what the corps calls its
Light Armored Vehicle, or LAV.
   President Bush ordered the battalions to Panama on Thursday.
   The LAV is an armored, eight-wheel personnel carrier that sports
a 25mm chain gun, which is a high-speed, heavy type of machine gun,
as well as a 7.62mm machine gun.
   The 7th Light Infantry Division and the 5th Infantry Division
are part of different corps within the Army _ I and III,
respectively _ and are based at different parts of the country _
Fort Ord, Calif., and Fort Polk, La.
   They also reflect deliberately different capabilities.
   The 7th, known as the Bayonet Division, was the first of four
active-duty light infantry divisions created by the Army during the
Reagan administration. Although the 7th has a long history as a
regular Army division, it didn't become a light infantry division
until Oct. 1, 1985.
   With about 10,700 soldiers assigned to it instead of the roughly
17,000 assigned to a normal mechanized division, the 7th is full of
riflemen; carries no heavy vehicles, and deploys with only modest
amounts of artillery and anti-tank weapons.
   The idea behind the light divisions, championed by former Army
Chief of Staff Gen. John Wickham, was to provide a president the
option of using a fairly large force that could be moved rapidly
around the world.
   For example, a normal heavy division, such as those assigned to
Europe, would require about 2,850 flights of a C-141 to deploy. A
complete light division could show up for combat with just 500
flights.
   The 7th was one of two Army units _ the other being the 82nd
Airborne _ tapped for a similar emergency deployment to Central
America in March 1988. In that case, the troops were sent to
Honduras because of incursions by Nicaraguan troops.
   The 5th Infantry Division, meantime, is a standard mechanized
division whose history dates to World War I. Known as the Red
Diamond Division, the 5th fought in four major campaigns during
World War I and five major campaigns in Europe during World War II.
   The 5th includes three active-duty mechanized brigades _ which
rely on armored personnel carriers such as the M-113 or the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle _ and three active-duty armor brigades equipped
with M-1A1 tanks.
   One ranking military official said Thursday a mechanized force
was being sent as a precaution in case the situation in Panama
deteriorated further and additional protection was needed to help
dependents evacuate.
   Although a mechanized infantry division can be transported by
air, the heavy equipment makes it a slow process. In this case, the
Pentagon announced the one battalion from the 5th would travel to
Panama by sea aboard the ship Bellatrix.
   The Marines, meantime, are sending Alpha Co. of the 2nd Light
Armored Infantry Battalion. That unit will be traveling by aircraft
with 18 of the new LAVs.
   The 2nd Marine Division traces its roots to Feb. 1, 1941, when
it was formed for World War II. During that war, the division
fought in some of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific, including
Guadalcanal, Tarawa and Okinawa.
   The 2nd also went to Lebanon in 1958 and 1982; to the Dominican
Republic in 1965, and to Grenada in 1983. It fights under the
motto, ``Second to None.''

<HEAD>Feds Urge Steps to Curb Rising TB Rate Behind Bars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. health officials are urging testing,
isolation and other measures to curb the spread of tuberculosis in
the nation's prisons.
   Centers for Disease Control researchers cited a survey in 29
states, where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per 100,000
inmates in 1984-85, compared with eight cases per 100,000 among
non-incarcerated adults in those states during the same period.
   ``In some large correctional systems, the incidence of TB has
increased dramatically,'' the CDC said in its report Thursday.
   It noted especially high rates in New York, New Jersey and
California.
   Tuberculosis, a contagious, bacterial lung disease, infects
about 22,000 people each year in the United States. Most can be
cured with drug treatment. Scientists estimate that about 10
million Americans are infected with the virus, but the vast
majority will never get the disease.
   The spread of AIDS-virus infections during this decade may play
a part in the spread of TB in prisons, the Atlanta-based CDC said.
AIDS weakens the immune systems of patients, making them more
susceptible to infections which other people might fight off,
including tuberculosis.
   Tests for acquired immune deficiency syndrome should be offered
to all inmates with known TB infections, the CDC report said.
   ``Persons at highest risk ... are close contacts,'' the CDC
said, noting that TB can pose particular problems in prisons,
``where the environment is often conducive to airborne transmission
of infection among inmates, staff and visitors.''
   The CDC committee recommends new tests at least once a year,
rapid chest X-rays for TB-infected people showing symptoms, and
isolation for those with suspected or confirmed symptomatic TB
cases.
   Isolation should include separate ventilation systems to cut
down the risk of airborne transmission of TB, the committee said.
``It may be necessary to move a patient to another facility or
hospital with a respiratory isolation facility,'' the panel said.
   Prison overcrowding may be a cause for spreading TB, said Dr.
Dixie Snider, a CDC tuberculosis specialist.
   In New York there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986
_ seven times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78.
   Inmates in New Jersey had a TB rate of 110 per 100,000 in 1987,
11 times higher than the general New Jersey population. In
California, the 80 per 100,000 rate was nearly six times higher
than in the general population.

<HEAD>Business Leaders See Slower Growth but No Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top business leaders today
predicted that economic growth this year will taper off from an
already slackening pace, but they nonetheless radiated confidence
that a recession can be avoided.
   In its semiannual forecast, the Business Council predicted that
growth, as measured by the gross national product, will fall to 2.9
percent this year and to 1.7 percent in 1990.
   Although that would represent a significant slowdown from the
healthy 3.9 percent pace posted last year, the council expressed
``general optimism'' that no economic downturn is likely in the
next two years.
   Indeed, the council's consensus report forecasts that growth
will rebound in the latter part of 1990, rising from 1.4 percent in
the first quarter to 3.1 percent by the fourth quarter.
   ``This suggests not only that recession will be avoided but that
the economy could be headed in 1991 toward an unprecedented ninth
year of peacetime cyclical expansion,'' the report said.
   The council, made up of executives of 65 of the nation's largest
corporations, said the anticipated slower-growth trend for the near
future comes largely from an expectation that exports and business
investment will contribute less to the economy this year than in
1988.
   The panel's economists also expressed concern about worsening
inflation extending into 1990, with some corporate analysts
expecting price increases to advance at an annual pace exceeding 6
percent.
   Inflation worries have heightened this year as several sharp
monthly advances in the Consumer Price Index combined to pace a 6.1
percent annual inflation rate during the first quarter.
   The council's consensus call is for a 5 percent rise in consumer
prices in both 1989 and 1990, up from 4.4 percent in the past two
years.
   ``The central view is that although the flare-up of prices early
in 1989 was an aberration, price behavior overall will not improve
appreciably until mid-1990,'' the report cautioned.
   It said future price increases would be held down somewhat by a
falloff in oil prices, which were a big part of the first-quarter
surge in inflation.
   The council's report, based on the judgment of 19 corporate
economists, said a minority of the analysts remain concerned about
``the lagging effects of inflation and believes that there will be
echoes from both the earlier period of strong economic growth and
the oil episode for some time after growth decelerates.''
   That is the recipe for so-called stagflation, a period when
prices continue to rise even as the economy loses steam.
   The Federal Reserve Board, concerned about the nation's
disturbing inflation numbers, has been pushing up interest rates
for the past year in an effort to ease inflationary pressures by
restraining economic growth.
   It is the Fed's anti-inflation campaign that has a growing
number of private analysts worried the central bank may
unintentionally push the nation into a recession as it tries to
hold the economy to a more sustainable level of growth.
   But the Business Council's judgment was that the further Fed
tightening is unlikely, contributing to expectations of a long life
for the current economic expansion, which already has achieved a
peacetime record at more than six years.
   Walter V. Shipley, chairman of Chemical Banking Corp., summed up
the council's three reasons for optimism: ``It doesn't believe
there are major imbalances in the economy at this time; it doesn't
think the Fed is going to nudge interest rates much higher; and it
sees other industrial economies continuing to perform strongly ...
thereby providing support for American exports.''
   The council did express some concern that less progress is
likely this year and in 1990 on reducing the country's massive
trade deficit, although it expects ``continuing moderate gains.''
   The 1990 trade gap is forecast at $100 billion, down from
$119.76 billion in 1988 and $152.12 billion in 1987.
   The projection for some ongoing improvement was partly based on
an expectation that slower economic growth in the United States
will dampen import demand even as export demand is sustained.
   In addition, the council said, the dollar is likely to decline
in value against other major currencies, helping make U.S. products
more competitive overseas.
   The economic forecast was issued at the start of a two-day
conference at which the executives will hear from speakers such as
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, members of the congressional budget
committees, and Richard Breeden, a key adviser to President Bush on
domestic issues.

<TEXT>
   A string of rare bird thefts at several
zoos around the country is prompting more stringent security, and
even leading some zoos to pull the valuable animals from exhibits.
   On May 2, a thief broke into the parrot cage at the Rio Grande
Zoological Park here and took an Australian king parrot, a
sulphur-crested cockatoo and a dusky lory.
   The crimson and green parrot _ one of only 12 such birds in
captivity _ was found dead on the zoo grounds. The lory, a
short-tailed parrot, flew back to the zoo. The white cockatoo with
a pale yellow crest is missing.
   ``I'm hopeful that whoever did it got chewed up sufficiently,''
said zoo Director John Moore. ``These birds are not real kind.''
   The global destruction of rain forests, the birds' natural
habitat, and export restrictions imposed by foreign countries have
driven up the value of rare birds and encouraged thefts, officials
say.
   Zoos in Los Angeles, San Diego, El Paso, Texas, Columbia, S.C.,
and elsewhere have been hit in recent years.
   ``There are people willing to pay, just like art collectors I
suppose, without asking questions,'' said Mike Cunningham,
associate curator of birds at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   ``If the birds are really rare, it's hard to find out where they
go. It's like somebody stealing a work of art. They don't take it
to the corner store and sell it.''
   Zoos are prime targets because they often hold rare species that
aren't available to the pet trade, he says.
   The lucrative black market also attracts smugglers.
   ``A lot of the same people that smuggle narcotics are smuggling
birds. The return is just as great,'' said John Cross, assistant
regional director of law enforcement for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service in Albuquerque.
   The U.S. Customs Service seizes rare birds almost daily along
the border with Mexico, which outlaws commercial exports, said
Charles Conroy, a Customs spokesman in Houston.
   ``Large cages are strapped to wooden rafts, floated across the
Rio Grande,'' Conroy said. ``We even had one case where a woman who
had an artificial leg brought six birds across in this artificial
leg that has been hollowed out.''
   Zoo officials would not put a price on the birds.
   ``In one respect they're priceless,'' said San Diego Zoo
spokesman Jeff Jouett. ``In another respect, I don't want to give
an incentive to anyone that would endanger the lives of these
birds.''
   The zoo lost a pair of Australian cockatoos, which are gray with
red markings, about a year ago.
   Palmer Krantz, director of the Riverbank Zoo in Columbia, S.C.,
also declined to discuss prices.
   ``When people visit the zoo, we want them to visit for the
beauty and educational value of the animal, not that it may be
worth $20,000 or $15,000,'' he said.
   Zoos that have been hit by thieves have beefed up security, and
some no longer exhibit their rarest birds.
   ``The birds that are highly saleable, like the rare cockatoos
and rare parrots, we don't have on display,'' said Cunningham of
Los Angeles. ``That's the sad part of it all. You can't display
something like that in a zoo because somebody's going to rip it
off.''
   Claudia Newman said the El Paso Zoo has pulled its rare birds
off display, loaned them to other zoos or sold them because of
thefts. Two parrots were stolen from the zoo in February and an
African gray parrot was taken about six months ago, she said.
   Many curators find it difficult to take such steps, though.
   ``The taxpayers pay for this and they ought to be able to see
it,'' said Moore of the Rio Grande Zoological Park. ``But if it
gets to the point we can't keep (rare birds), maybe I think we
ought not to have them.''

   The deployment of additional American troops
to Panama will bolster the U.S. presence there with armored
vehicles as well as additional manpower once it is completed in a
week or more.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said President Bush
on Thursday ordered 1,881 soldiers and Marines sent to Panama in an
operation the Defense Department called ``Nimrod Dancer.''
   The units will include two Army battalions and one Marine
company, Howard said, and the Marines and one of the Army
battalions will be bringing a large number of vehicles with them.
   A battalion from the 5th Infantry Division at Fort Polk, La.,
will travel to Panama by sea with 726 soldiers and 59 M-113 armored
personnel carriers; six M-106 mortar vehicles and 106 support
vehicles.
   The Marine company, meantime, will travel by air with 18 Light
Armored Vehicles, a relatively new weapon introduced to Marine
forces in 1984 that has eight wheels, can ford streams and carries
a 22mm chain gun and 7.62mm machine gun.
   One Pentagon official who requested anonymity said the Defense
Department had made a deliberate decision to move in armored
personnel carriers because of a concern they might be needed to
evacuate Americans.
   The other Army battalion is being dispatched by air from the 7th
Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif., Howard said. It will
include 890 soldiers in a battalion, plus one headquarters company
of 100 soldiers.
   The spokesman said some of the initial elements of the 7th Light
Infantry Division and of the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune,
N.C., could depart for Panama within the next 24 hours.
   The first soldiers headed south Thursday night as almost 1,000
infantry troops left Fort Ord. The 7th Light Infantry Division at
Fort Ord dispatched 880 combat troops and 100 cooks, medics and
other support soldiers to Travis Air Force Base, 160 miles away,
for the flight to Central America.
   But Howard added a total of 70 airplane flights, using C-141
cargo planes, and ``several days'' will be required to complete the
aerial deployment of the troops and Marines.
   As for the 5th Infantry Division's battalion, with its heavier
equipment, Howard declined to estimate how long the voyage by sea
would take. But other sources said ``roughly a week'' would be
required.
   The battalion must travel from Fort Polk to Beaumont, Texas, to
load up on the Military Sealift Command ship Bellatrix for the
voyage, Howard said.
   The spokesman added the troops would be sent to U.S. military
installations in Panama for the sole purpose of protecting the
lives of American citizens and ensuring security of the canal
itself.
   But he said the United States would exercise its right of access
to use public roads in Panama and that there was ``no end time''
for bringing the troops home.
   Howard also said the U.S. Southern Command, which is based in
Panama, had begun notifying the families of servicemen living off
military bases to move to one of the 10 military bases the United
States still operates in Panama.
   The spokesman said the families of servicemen who were ``command
sponsored,'' meaning they were there under official U.S. government
sponsorship, were being ordered to bases.
   The families who are not command sponsored are being urged to
move to military installations, but cannot be forced to do so,
Howard said.
   According to the Pentagon, there are about 14,000 dependents of
servicemen and Defense Department employees living in Panama, of
whom 3,081 live off base. Of that total, 1,396 are
command-sponsored and 1,685 are not.

<HEAD>Midgetman Missile Destroyed After Malfunction In First Test Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first test flight
of an unarmed Midgetman missile was cut short when Air Force
officials destroyed the rocket after a malfunction.
   The missile began tumbling about 70 seconds after launch
Thursday morning as its second stage was firing. A range safety
officer issued a command that destroyed the missile two minutes and
nine seconds into flight, said Maj. Gen. Ed Barry, director of the
Midgetman program.
   ``This was a partial success in that we achieved 50 percent of
our flight objectives,'' Barry said.
   Excellent telemetry data was received on the first stage and
most of the second stage, he said. The missile was destroyed 10 to
12 seconds before the third stage was to ignite.
   The Midgetman is designed to be fired from a mobile, trucklike
launcher and has been in development since 1983.
   Steam pressure popped the missile 150 to 200 feet out of a
launch canister on a pad. Then its first stage rocket motor ignited
and boosted it across the partly cloudy, windy sky.
   The missile was supposed to deliver a dummy warhead to a test
range about 4,600 miles away in the Kwajalein Atoll about 30
minutes after launch.
   Barry said congressional critics shouldn't view the test as a
setback. ``This is a developmental flight testing program,'' he
said.
   The Midgetman, formally the Small Intercontinental Ballistic
Missile, is designed to carry a single nuclear warhead to a target
up to 6,900 miles away.
   Its future is clouded by an intense political debate over
whether the United States should develop one or two mobile,
land-based missiles for its nuclear arsenal. The Soviet Union
already has developed and begun deploying two such missiles. The
United States has none.
   A version of the 10-warhead MX missile that could be launched
from a railroad car is favored by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
who says the Pentagon would be hard pressed by the $25 billion cost
of 500 Midgetmans.
   But President Bush recently decided that both the MX and the
Midgetman should be developed.

<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A baby girl was delivered in
critical condition by a brain-dead teen-ager whose life has
depended on a life-support system for two months.
   The newborn, delivered seven weeks premature by emergency
Caesarean section, was listed in critical condition late Thursday,
said Joy Flint, a nursing supervisor at San Bernardino County
Medical Center. The infant suffers from a debilitating lung ailment.
   The 15-year-old mother, Tanya Marie Rivera, will remain on life
support until her parents make a decision on whether to cut it off,
Mrs. Flint said.
   County authorities had obtained a court order keeping the system
on after the parents requested that it be unhooked in March. The
Right To Life League of Southern California and Roman Catholic
Bishop Philip F. Straling also joined the debate.
   The divorced parents, George and Alicia Rivera, last week agreed
with medical center officials that the teen-age mother should
remain alive until her baby was brought to full term.
   Miss Rivera was declared brain dead on March 15 after she was
shot in the head. Police say her 16-year-old boyfriend, whom they
believe is the child's father, fired the shot.
   Charges have not been filed against the juvenile in the case,
and his name has not been released although authorites have
disclosed that he goes by the street name ``Stymie.'' He reportedly
is in jail in Los Angeles for an unrelated murder charge.
   An emergency Caesarean operation was necessary because the
baby's life was in danger, hospital Director Charles Jervis said.
The baby was delivered Thursday morning.
   Doctors said the baby is suffering from hyaline membrane
disease, caused by a deficiency of a bodily chemical that normally
coats tiny sacs within the lung, where blood in the membrane
absorbs oxygen. Without the chemical, called surficant, the sacs
collapse with each breath the baby takes.

<HEAD>Moslem Students Protest Book on Sexual Practices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 2,500 Chinese Moslems chanting ``Punish
China's Rushdie'' marched through Beijing today demanding two
editors be imprisoned for publishing a book on the sexual habits of
Moslems.
   ``These men must be jailed,'' said Li Jing, a Uighur Turk from
the Central Academy of Nationalities and a leader of the protest.
``If they disappeared from the face of the earth, we would be
happy.''
   The protest came a day after Iranian President Ali Khamenei told
a news conference in Beijing that Iran still demands the execution
of British author Salman Rushie, who is accused of blaspheming the
Islamic religion in his book, ``Satanic Verses.''
   The Chinese book in question is called ``Sex Habits,'' a
compilation of essays on the sexual tastes of people around the
world.
   The section on Islam says that the purpose of a Moslem's
pilgrammage to Mecca is to engage in bestiality. It said the domes
and towers of Moslem mosques symbolize human sex organs.
   In an unusually early report by Chinese standards, Beijing's
afternoon newspaper, the Beijing Evening News, reported the
demonstration. It also said the book had been banned in Beijing
``because it has hurt the unity of China's minorities.''
   ``The city Communist Party committee and city government clearly
stated that this book must be swiftly suppressed,'' the paper said.
   The demonstration, which included students from eight school and
13 minority groups, twisted through the streets of Beijing's Moslem
quarter to the Niujie Mosque, Bejing's oldest.
   Mullahs at the temple set out tea for the marches and police
directed traffic out of their path. The demonstration was the first
in more than three weeks of student protests in Beijing to be given
official approval. Earlier protests have called for a free press
and democracy.
   ``Allah is great!'' the crowd chanted as it marched down the
street. ``Down with blasphemy!''
   A member of the Uzbek minority led the protest, cradling a
framed letter of permission from the Beijing Public Security
Bureau. Hundreds of men in white fezzes and women in colored
scarves followed.
   ``We support them fully,'' said Ma Yue, an official at the
Niujie Mosque, as he watched the marchers pass. ``These men should
not be allowed to publish this stuff. They have seriously insulted
the Moslem peoples.''
   Uighur Turks, who inhabit the northwest province of Xinjiang,
are also known to clash occasionally with local Chinese in smaller
protests.
   The book's editors are Han Chinese, the main ethnic group in
China comprising more than 90 percent of the population. They are
apparently teachers from Shanxi province but published the book
under pen names.
   The book has been selling rapidly since it was published by the
Shanghai Cultural Publishing Co. in March. Chinese sources said
that in early May the Shanghai city government stopped a second
printing of the book, which had already sold 50,000 copies.
   City officials also are trying to recall the book, offering
three times its official price of 94 cents, but to no avail, they
said.
   ``The black market price has already hit 50 yuan ($13.50),''
said one Chinese journalist familiar with the book.
   On the street, students passed out leaflets.
   ``Our great and holy Islam religion has again been insulted by
vicious scoundrels,'' read one pamphlet referring to the first
insult as being the Rushdie affair. ``Facing this kind of brazen
insult, how can a true Moslem remain aloof?''
   The demonstration ended at Tiananmen Square, where student
leaders presented a letter to the National People's Congress,
China's legislature, calling for the imprisonment of the editors.
   One Moslem student, who watched from the protest from the Niujie
Mosque, said he supported the demonstration but did not believe the
editors should be jailed.
   ``It's just like the Rushdie case,'' he said. ``We shouldn't
kill these people or throw them in jail. We should criticize them.
I may be a Moslem but I am also a modern youth.''

Study Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Public health workers should hit the streets to
warn about the danger of AIDS among the nation's 1.2 million
intravenous drug abusers, up to one-third of whom may already be
infected, a researcher says.
   ``Outreach seems to be a very important component'' of the fight
against the spread of the virus, said Dr. Robert A. Hahn of the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   Hahn urged the anti-AIDS effort in conjunction with a study he
and a team of researchers published in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   About 15 percent of intravenous drug abusers are in drug
treatment at any given time, he said.
   That percentage could be increased by health workers ``going out
into the streets, finding out where they are and what they're doing
... trying to get them into therapy, trying to educate them,'' Hahn
said.
   The researchers reviewed 92 studies of intravenous drug abusers
in late 1987 and found wide regional variation in the rates of
infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The highest rates were in the Northeast, where the prevalence,
depending on the study, was 10 percent to 65 percent, and in Puerto
Rico, where the prevalence was 45 percent to 59 percent.
   Lower rates were found in the South Atlantic region, 7 percent
to 29 percent, as well as in metropolitan Atlanta with 10 percent
and in Detroit and San Francisco, both 7 percent to 13 percent, the
researchers said.
   In the West, Midwest and South, infections occurred among 5
percent or less of drug abusers tested.
   ``The wide variation in HIV prevalences found in this survey
indicates an opportunity to prevent increases in many areas of the
United States,'' the researchers wrote.
   The total number of infected drug users could be from 61,000 to
398,000, or 5 percent to 33 percent of the total injection
drug-abusing U.S. population, the study found.
   At least 94,280 Americans have contracted AIDS since 1979 and
54,402 of them have died, according to CDC figures as of April 30.
   The virus that causes the incurable and fatal syndrome is passed
mainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and
from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth.
   Intravenous drug users comprise 20 percent of adult cases
reported so far, and homosexual and bisexual men who also inject
drugs make up another 7 percent of adult cases, according to CDC
figures.
   The proportion of drug abuse-related AIDS cases has risen in
recent years. The CDC said in March that 10,747 drug-related AIDS
cases were reported in 1988, up from 6,747 the year before.

   Radical student leaders vowed today
to press further with their drive to oust President Roh Tae-woo and
expel U.S. forces as thousands of supporters shouted ``Get out,
Yankee devils!``
   Meanwhile in Kwangju, thousands of students assembled for
rallies denouncing the death of a 24-year-old radical student whose
body was found Wednesday. Dissident groups have charged Lee
Chol-kyu was tortured and killed by police.
   Police have denied the charges and Roh has ordered a thorough
investigation of the case. About 30 students visited the hospital
morgue today where Lee's body laid, cut their fingers and wrote
``Punish Roh Tae-woo'' in blood on placards.
   About 4,000 radical student representatives from across South
Korea attended a meeting of the National Council of Students in
Taejon to discuss strategy and prepare for anti-government protests.
   Authorities mobilized 4,000 riot police for the student
demonstration at Chungnam University, but troopers did not
intervene.
   Student leaders denounced the Roh government, charging it was
plotting to impose authoritarian rule. Leaders called for
nationwide protests later this month to topple Roh.
   ``We must oust the Roh regime,'' said one leader as protesters
cheered and beat drums and brass gongs.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests and labor
strikes in recent months as radical groups have tried to weaken the
government. But the radicals are not seen as a serious threat to
the government despite their violent tactics.
   Student leaders in Taejon, 84 miles south of Seoul, called for
the expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea based
under a mutual defense treaty. They charged Washington and the Roh
government were imposing colonial rule on the country.
   Other speakers charged the United States was keeping troops in
South Korea to block reunification with communist North Korea. They
called for immediate reunification with the north.
   ``Let's inflict an irrevocable defeat on U.S. imperialism and
advance the unification of our fatherland,'' said student leader Im
Chong-suk.
   Cheering students chanted, ``Punish Yankee imperialism'' and
``Yankees go home.''
   Leaders denounced a proposal to relocate some U.S. military
units from Seoul to Taejon. They charged American soldiers would
spread AIDS among the local population.
   Speakers ridiculed American soldiers as the ``AIDS legion.''
   The radical leaders said they would continue to try to avoid
violent protests, but vowed never to give up their drive to topple
the Roh government.
   Some radical students have said they would halt violent protests
after six riot policemen were killed and 10 others critically
injured May 3 in a clash with students in Pusan.
   The Roh government ordered a major crackdown on dissident groups
after the deaths. Many South Koreans, angered by the deaths, have
called for an end to a recent wave of violent anti-government
protests and labor strikes.
   Radical students claim Roh is a front for military rule and
Washington helps control the Seoul government.
   U.S. officials have agreed to a plan to relocate some military
units from Seoul to Taejon to free up needed land in the capital
and to reduce the visibility of the American military presence.
   South Korean and U.S. officials say American troops are needed
in the south to defend against possible threats from communist
North Korea. U.S. forces have been in the south since intervening
in 1950 to help stop the North Korean invasion that started the
three-year Korean War.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An interview with former Hungarian
leader Janos Kadar seems to contradict official reports he is
gravely ill and suggests the path to reform is not entirely cleared.
   Neither Kadar nor Magyarorszag, the conservative magazine
publishing the interview today, indicate he is in the dire state of
health claimed by party officials who stripped him of his last
posts earlier this week.
   It is presumed they acted at the urging of Communist Party
reformers troubled by increasing indications that Kadar played a
role in official repressions after the 1956 anti-Communist revolt.
   Kadar is rumored to have resisted the push for more democracy
since he was replaced as Communist Party leader a year ago.
   State television reported last week that Kadar's secretary,
Robert Ribanszky, has found a conservative Communist Party faction
that threatens to establish an independent, more hard-line party.
   The first installment of the interview, to be serialized by the
weekly magazine, is accompanied by a picture of the 76-year-old
Kadar, casually dressed and relaxed behind a desk.
   He refers to minor health problems in the interview _ a rarity
since his departure from the top party post.
   Party Central Committee secretary Gyoergy Fejti told reporters
Kadar was stripped of his honorary title of party president Monday
because he is gravely ill in a ``seemingly irreversible process.''
   The new party chief, Karoly Grosz, said this month that Kadar is
disabled by lung disease.
   State radio Tuesday reported that Kadar spoke incoherently at an
April 12 Central Committee session. Other officials refer to
serious mental and physical impairments.
   Magyarorszag's motives for portraying Kadar in a more vibrant
light and giving him a platform to recount his 32-year leadership
were not immediately known. But the newspaper may be in the control
of anti-reformists.
   Andras Kanyo, Magyarorszag's new chief editor, added to the
mystery by refusing to tell The Associated Press when the interview
with Kadar was conducted, and hinting next week's issue will
contain some major disclosure.
   But it was clear from references to the April 12 Central
Committee session that Kadar gave the interview within the last
month.
   Kadar referred to the trial of Laszlo Rajk, the former foreign
minister executed in 1949 after conviction on trumped-up charges.
   The repressions against Rajk and execution of Imre Nagy for his
leading role in the 1956 revolt are among incidents Kadar has been
linked with.
   Kadar denied playing an important part in Rajk's trial or
confession of alleged treason. The government daily Magyar Hirlap
on Saturday printed an account by former senior communist Mihaly
Farkas that told how he and Kadar personally approved Rajk's
beating by the secret police.
   In a letter Wednesday to the Central Committee, Kadar said he

always acted with good intent.
   He said his doctors had ordered him to cut back on work last
November and that his health took an unspecified turn for the worse
in April.
   But the letter shed no light on the continuing mystery
surrounding his whereabouts and physical condition.

<HEAD>$100 Million Settlement Reported in Dupont Plaza Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A settlement has been reached in
the Dupont Plaza fire of New Year's Eve 1986 that calls for the
hotel to pay $100 million to about 2,300 plaintiffs, a newspaper
reported. The blaze killed 97 people.
   The San Juan Star, an English-language daily, said in its report
Thursday that lawyers had agreed to $100 million and signed the
deal late Tuesday in the Philadelphia court chambers of U.S.
District Judge Louis Bechtle.
   Federal Judge Raymond L. Acosta was given a sealed envelope
Wednesday containing details of a settlement. Court spokesman Pedro
A. Malonet would not reveal the terms, but said Acosta would
announce today whether he accepted the agreement.
   The Star Tribune of Minneapolis quoted James Fetterly, a
Minneapolis lawyer for the hotel, as saying the settlement would be
substantially less than the $200 million for the the 1980 MGM Hotel
fire in Las Vegas.
   Plaintiffs in the case, being tried in U.S. District Court in
San Juan, had sought damages of $1.8 billion.
   A former hotel maintenance worker pleaded guilty to setting the
Dupont Plaza fire during a labor dispute at the 22-story hotel,
which was packed with almost 1,000 tourists. About 140 people were
injured.
   The hotel was cited for 25 violations by the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, including lack of emergency exits from
the casino, where 84 of the victims died.
   Richard Bieder, whose Bridgeport, Conn., law firm represents the
families of the nine Connecticut people killed in the blaze,
confirmed Wednesday there was a settlement, but refused to discuss
the amount.
   Fetterly said the settlement did not cover claims against about
170 defendants, including those who provided furnishings and
services in the hotel.

<TEXT>
   About 2,500 Chinese Moslems chanting ``Punish
China's Rushdie'' marched through Beijing today demanding two
editors be imprisoned for publishing a book on the sexual habits of
Moslems.
   ``These men must be jailed,'' said Li Jing, a Uighur Turk from
the Central Academy of Nationalities and a leader of the protest.
``If they disappeared from the face of the earth, we would be
happy.''
   The protest came a day after Iranian President Ali Khamenei told
a news conference in Beijing that Iran still demands the execution
of British author Salman Rushie, who is accused of blaspheming the
Islamic religion in his book, ``Satanic Verses.''
   The Chinese book in question is called ``Sex Habits,'' a
compilation of essays on the sexual tastes of people around the
world.
   The section on Islam says that the purpose of a Moslem's
pilgrammage to Mecca is to engage in bestiality. It said the domes
and towers of Moslem mosques symbolize human sex organs.
   In an unusually early report by Chinese standards, Beijing's
afternoon newspaper, the Beijing Evening News, reported the
demonstration. It also said the book had been banned in Beijing
``because it has hurt the unity of China's minorities.''
   ``The city Communist Party committee and city government clearly
stated that this book must be swiftly suppressed,'' the paper said.
   The demonstration, which included students from eight school and
13 minority groups, twisted through the streets of Beijing's Moslem
quarter to the Niujie Mosque, Bejing's oldest.
   Mullahs at the temple set out tea for the marches and police
directed traffic out of their path. The demonstration was the first
in more than three weeks of student protests in Beijing to be given
official approval. Earlier protests have called for a free press
and democracy.
   ``Allah is great!'' the crowd chanted as it marched down the
street. ``Down with blasphemy!''
   A member of the Uzbek minority led the protest, cradling a
framed letter of permission from the Beijing Public Security
Bureau. Hundreds of men in white fezzes and women in colored
scarves followed.
   ``We support them fully,'' said Ma Yue, an official at the
Niujie Mosque, as he watched the marchers pass. ``These men should
not be allowed to publish this stuff. They have seriously insulted
the Moslem peoples.''
   Uighur Turks, who inhabit the northwest province of Xinjiang,
are also known to clash occasionally with local Chinese in smaller
protests.
   The book's editors are Han Chinese, the main ethnic group in
China comprising more than 90 percent of the population. They are
apparently teachers from Shanxi province but published the book
under pen names.
   The book has been selling rapidly since it was published by the
Shanghai Cultural Publishing Co. in March. Chinese sources said
that in early May the Shanghai city government stopped a second
printing of the book, which had already sold 50,000 copies.
   City officials also are trying to recall the book, offering
three times its official price of 94 cents, but to no avail, they
said.
   ``The black market price has already hit 50 yuan ($13.50),''
said one Chinese journalist familiar with the book.
   On the street, students passed out leaflets.
   ``Our great and holy Islam religion has again been insulted by
vicious scoundrels,'' read one pamphlet referring to the first
insult as being the Rushdie affair. ``Facing this kind of brazen
insult, how can a true Moslem remain aloof?''
   The demonstration ended at Tiananmen Square, where student
leaders presented a letter to the National People's Congress,
China's legislature, calling for the imprisonment of the editors.
   One Moslem student, who watched from the protest from the Niujie
Mosque, said he supported the demonstration but did not believe the
editors should be jailed.
   ``It's just like the Rushdie case,'' he said. ``We shouldn't
kill these people or throw them in jail. We should criticize them.
I may be a Moslem but I am also a modern youth.''

<HEAD>Senior Leader Ito Refuses to Replace Takeshita</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with party quotes, Abe, Ito meeting,

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior politician Masayoshi Ito today officially
refused a ruling party request that he take over as prime minister
to restore confidence in the government following an
influence-peddling scandal.
   Leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party had wanted
Ito, one of a handful of experienced leaders untainted by the
Recruit Co. scandal, to replace Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to
improve the party's image ahead of summer elections for half the
seats in Parliament's upper house.
   ``Mr. Ito formally expressed his rejection ... and despite party
leaders' persistent attempts to persuade him, didn't change his
position,'' party Deputy Secretary General Ryutaro Hashimoto told a
news conference.
   Ito rejected a series of appeals by party Secretary General
Shintaro Abe, Hashimoto said, adding that Ito's refusal left the
party ``at a loss.''
   ``We can't just accept his rejection as it is, and requested him
to reconsider once again,'' Hashimoto said.
   But the 75-year-old Ito, a diabetic, has repeatedly said he is
not interested in becoming party president, and thus prime
minister, citing his age and poor health.
   Hashimoto said Ito's reasons for rejecting leadership were his
health and disagreement with party leaders on the way it was taking
responsibility for the scandal and on measures for party reform.
   The Kyodo News Service said Ito had told Takeshita all party
figures linked to the scandal should resign from Parliament, but
the prime minister had rejected it as an impractical idea.
   Whoever is chosen to head the ruling party becomes prime
minister because of the party's large majority in Parliament.
   Ito's formal denial has left the conservatives without a strong
candidate to replace Takeshita, who has said he will step down
after this year's budget is passed by Parliament, expected later
this month.
   Party sources said Abe intends to resign his party post if he
fails in his assigned job of persuading Ito to become prime
minister.
   Takeshita, who has admitted receiving more than $1.11 million in
donations from Recruit, an information services conglomerate,
announced April 25 he would resign to take responsibility for
public outrage over the scandal.
   Three of his Cabinet ministers have resigned over the scandal
and 14 businessmen and ex-bureaucrats have been arrested on bribery
or other charges in connection with sales of unlisted,
bargain-priced shares in a Recruit subsidiary.
   On Thursday, Takeshita wined and dined Ito as the party sought
to convince him to take over the job.
   After his dinner meeting with Takeshita late Thursday, however,
Ito said he had not changed his mind.
   Ito said his talks with Takeshita had centered on reform of the
party.
   ``Revolutionary changes in the party's way of thinking are
needed,'' Ito said.

hours after tornadoes touched down in New Mexico and Montana.
   In Texas, thunderstorms left dime-size hail 3 inches deep at
Frankel City, and more than 4 inches of rain fell in less than an
hour at Fort Stockton late Thursday.
   A combination of moist, unstable air and a cold front produced
severe thunderstorms across parts of the Rockies and high Plains

Bountiful and 1\ inches east of Salt Lake City.
   Thunderstorms also produced as much as 1{ inches of rain and
lowland flooding in Banner and Scottsbluff counties in western
Nebraska.
   Rain continued to fall over New England and the lower Great
Lakes. More than 3 inches of rain soaked Portland, Maine, in the 24
hours ended early today.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
northern and central Rockies to the western Plains; severe
thunderstorms likely from southwest Texas to the Texas and Oklahoma
panhandles; and showers over the northern and middle Atlantic

<HEAD>Dollar Higher But Off Best Levels, Gold Also Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was higher in early European
trading today but off its best levels after the Bank of Japan
indicated its recent rise had gone too far. Gold prices were also
higher.
   Some traders maintained the dip was only a technical correction
and said support for the dollar remains strong.
   As the dollar surged to an eight-month high in Tokyo, the Bank
of Japan said it will take appropriate action with other
industrialized nations if necessary to curb its strength.
   But one trader in Milan said despite concerns of the West German
and Japanese central banks that the dollar is too strong, the
market will continue to call the shots.
   ``This is a situation where the market is dictating. Even if
they want to revalue the mark there is nothing they can do as long
as marks are being sold to buy dollars,'' one trader said. He said
central bank intervention was unlikely until current conditions
change.
   Traders said a report later today on U.S. producer prices for
April may give an additional boost to the dollar if it confirms
market expectations that inflationary pressures aren't easing. The
market forecast a rise of 0.7 percent in the producer price index
for April following a 0.4 percent increase in March.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar hit 135.80 yen, up 1.25 yen. Later, in London,
it rose even higher to 135.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.9160 German marks, up from 1.9135
   _1.71215 Swiss francs, up from 1.7060
   _6.48075 French francs, up from 6.4665
   _2.16235 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1580
   _1,396.80 Italian lire, up from 1,395.75
   _1.1870 Canadian dollars, unchanged
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6635, compared with
$1.6655 Thursday.
   Bullion dealers said gold prices were flirting with the $380
level for the first time in recent weeks.
   Gold opened in London at $380.15 a troy ounce, up from $379 bid
late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $379.65.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $379.70, up from $378.20 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.30 to close at $380.26.
   Silver was quoted in London today at $5.66 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Thursday's late bid.

<HEAD>Presidential Front-Runner Rejects Both Majority, Minority Rule</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Party leader F.W. de
Klerk, expected to become the next president, said today that he
seeks a ``drastically changed'' political system in which neither
the white minority nor black majority can dominate.
   In his most detailed policy speech since becoming party leader
Feb. 2, de Klerk told Parliament that establishment of a
one-person, one-vote system would lead to black majority rule,
which he termed ``totally unacceptable.''
   But excluding blacks from decision-making, as advocated by the
far-right Conservative Party, ``would ultimately lead to conflict
and revolution that would destroy the very security and freedom of
whites which the (Conservative Party) claims to be protecting,'' de
Klerk said.
   He said the National Party sought a system in which decisions
were made by consensus. Disputes ``should be settled by a fair
referee,'' he said without elaborating.
   ``White security can never be built on injustice toward
others,'' he said. ``The present situation cannot last
indefinitely. Things will have to change drastically and quickly.''
   Klerk, 53, became party leader when the post was vacated by
President P.W. Botha, who suffered a stroke in January. Botha, head
of government since 1978, plans to retire after a general election
on Sept. 6, and de Klerk, the education minister, is virtually
assured of succeeding him.
   The National Party is expected to retain its overwhelming
majority in the dominant white chamber of Parliament despite
challenges from the Conservative Party and the anti-apartheid
Democratic Party.
   ``The Conservative Party stands for a minority government in a
South Africa that will, by its own admission, in perpetuity be
populated by a majority of people of color. It is unfair and does
not pass the test of justice,``' de Klerk said.
   ``The Democratic Party stands for a majority government. In a
country with such a massive and wide diversity as ours, this is
unfair to the smaller peoples and population groups. Their policy
too fails the test of justice.''
   De Klerk's speech came a day after a fellow Cabinet member and
senior party leader, Constitutional Development Minister Chris
Heunis, announced his resignation. Last week, Heunis made a speech
suggesting that blacks be given a role in Parliament, in the
Cabinet and in the selection of a president.
   Parliament currently includes subordinate chambers for Asians
and people of mixed-race, but the 28 million blacks have no formal
role of any sort in national politics.
   De Klerk played down the significance of Heunis' speech, saying,
``To deduce from his speech that the National Party is now
following in the Democratic Party's tracks on the way to majority
rule is untrue.''
   The Conservative Party leader, Andries Treurnicht, nonethelesss
charged that the govermnment's policies would lead to black rule.
   ``South Africa is at the end of a failed political experiment,
and the National Party government is in disarray,'' Treurnicht said.

   Munich fire and rescue officials said the fifth person on board
the aircraft was injured. A man on the ground also suffered burns
when he tried to rescue the passengers, authorities said in a

   Officials said the single-engine Beechcraft plane, bound for
Budapest, Hungary, grazed the roof of a building near the airport
just outside the Bavarian capital and plunged into a garden.
   Police quoted witnesses as saying the plane failed to gain
altitude, lost power as its engine apparently stalled, went into a
spin and crashed shortly after takeoff.

<TEXT>
   John P. Mack's desk at the Capitol is empty
today, but questions remain about the balance between justice and
forgiveness following his resignation amid a furor over his brutal
attack on a woman 16 years ago.
   A top aide to House Speaker Jim Wright and one of the most
powerful staff members in Congress, Mack resigned Thursday, saying,
``I wish I could rewrite the past, but unfortunately I can't.''
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., co-chairwoman of the
Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, called the resignation
``very sad'' but ``necessary.''
   ``I believe in rehabilitation, but not when it leads to such a
high position,'' she said.
   While many people on Capitol Hill knew the Mack story, it
resurfaced last week when The Washington Post published fresh
details of the unprovoked 1973 attack in an interview with the
victim, Pamela Small.
   Small recounted how Mack, then a 19-year-old store manager,
attacked her with a hammer, stabbed her with a steak knife and then
left her for dead in her car. Doctors said she was lucky to survive.
   At the time, Wright's daughter was married to Mack's brother.
Although he was sentenced to 15 years in prison, Mack served just
27 months and was given a job by Wright following his parole. He
rose steadily from a $9,000-a-year mail clerk's position to become
the $89,500-a-year head of the Democratic Steering and Policy
Committee, which sets the majority party's agenda in the House.
   Wright said in a statement that he had been ``willing to give
this young man another chance, and in the intervening years I have
never had occasion to regret it.'' The speaker, already under fire
and the subject of a House ethics investigation, said Mack resigned
without being asked.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said that after the victim's
account was published, ``There was an immediate reaction that went
nationwide.''
   ``I can understand the emotional outcry,'' he said. ``I heard it
from my staff. ... We heard it in congressional committees.''
   As executive director of the steering committee, Mack was a
visible figure in the House, often working on the floor and running
meetings for Wright.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said he was ``very
sorry'' that Mack resigned, and called him ``one of the most able
and dedicated employees'' in Congress.
   ``This society believes in forgiveness,'' added Rep. Tony
Coelho, D-Calif., the House majority whip and a close friend of
Mack's.
   The two were even investors together in Dairy Management
Associates, a business in Merced, Calif., Coelho's hometown,
according to David Dreyer, Coelho's spokesman.
   Others were less sympathetic, especially in light of Small's
declaration that Mack had never apologized or made any restitution
for his attack on her.
   Last week, Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., talked with Schroeder and
Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, the other co-chair of the women's
caucus, about what course of action to follow, Snowe said. Martin
also broached the subject of Mack with Wright, an aide said.
   ``I think Mr. Mack made the appropriate decision,'' Martin said
following the resignation.
   On Wednesday, Snowe, one of 26 women in the House, said she
drafted a letter to Wright, telling him ``he ought to reconsider
John Mack.'' The message to Wright was that he ought to dismiss his
assistant, she said.
   Snowe, who had obtained signatures from several other female GOP
House members, said she never gave the letter to the speaker
because Mack resigned, making the suggestion moot.
   Snowe said she believed Mack shouldn't hold such an influential
job when he ``clearly violated the law, didn't finish his sentence
and didn't pay restitution'' to Small.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said, ``apparently there was outrage
among the women members of Congress'' over the Mack story. Rep.
Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said she'd always found Mack to be a
decent person but the type of crime he committed was ``very
offensive.''
   Snowe said women often ``feel vulnerable'' when they read
stories like the one about Mack.
   But Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., was critical of the timing of
the Post's story at a time when Wright is under fire from the House
ethics committee for his personal financial dealings.
   ``I don't see what has been gained by this,'' she said.
   Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, said Mack's success on Capitol
Hill ``obviously upset some people.''
   ``We all believe in rehabilitation, that's everyone'e goal,'' he
said. But he said society wants rehabilitated convicts to be
``carpenters and plumbers,'' not high-ranking congressional aides.

<HEAD>Five Killed by Runaway Tractor-Trailer; Mountain Road Had Drawn Complaints</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Villagers complained about the safety
of a steep mountain road just two days before a runaway
tractor-trailer careened down the road and smashed a car, killing
five people, a resident said.
   The 18-wheel truck with yellow ``Wide Load'' signs was carrying
a huge ditch-digging machine down Laurel Mountain on U.S. 30, about
50 miles east of Pittsburgh, state police said.
   With its headlights flashing and horn blaring, the runaway truck
roared about two miles down the two-lane road into this village of
750 people, slamming into a passenger car and killing the three
people inside. The truck's driver and his passenger also died.
   Westmoreland County Deputy Coroner Joe Musgrove identified the
victims as Walter Lepley, 63, who was driving the car; his wife,
Helen, 57; and Robert Holsopple, 83, all of Boswell.
   The driver of the truck was identified as Donald Frey, 34, of
Clyde, Ohio, and his passenger as James Burkholder, 45, of
Bloomington, Ind.
   No other injuries were reported.
   After hitting the car, the truck's cab and flatbed trailer
slammed into a three-story frame apartment house. Witnesses said
the cab burst into flames, which soon engulfed the building.
   ``I ran to the scene and saw bodies lying everywhere, pieces of
bodies everywhere,'' said Jack Steitz, who operates Ligioner
Mountain Outfitters, directly across from the highway from the
apartment building.
   Tom Harrison, who lived in the apartment building, said he was
stepping out of the building at midmorning when he saw the truck
coming. He said he alerted the only other person in the building at
the time, a woman on the third floor, and both escaped safely.
   Meanwhile, the ditch-digging machine spun about 100 yards beyond
the truck, hitting several telephone poles and signs before
skidding to a stop in front of the Ligonier Country Inn, witnesses
said.
   For several hours, electricity was cut to about 400 homes and
the highway was closed while authorities cleared the debris and
doused the fire.
   State police said the rig may have lost its brakes.
   Steitz said the mountain has a turnoff near its summit for
trucks to check their brakes, but no escape ramp on the descending
curves.
   As recently as Tuesday, Laughlintown residents presented a
petition to the Ligonier Township Commission demanding the
municipal government do something about the danger of runaway
trucks on the highway, he said.
   Authorities said the truck was owned by Bower Billing Services
of Clyde, Ohio, and was en route from Baltimore to Clyde. The
company was not listed in an Ohio telephone directory.

<TEXT>
   Syrian gunners fired six rockets at the
Christian coastline today in a barrage apparently designed to warn
Gen. Michel Aoun against using a cease-fire to resupply his troops.
   The United States and the Soviet Union called in a joint
statement for an end to hostilities in Lebanon.
   Police said the Soviet-designed 122mm Grad rockets were fired
from Moslem west Beirut shortly before dawn. They crashed along the
coast north of Beirut, causing damage but no injuries.
   A police spokesman said that was the only violation today of a
day-old cease fire called by the Arab League. It was the fifth
truce called by the league in two months of bloodletting between
Aoun's 22,000 Christian army troops and an alliance of Syrian and
Druse Moslem forces.
   Lebanon's government is split by rival Cabinets, the Christian
on headed by Aoun and the Moslem one led by Salim Hoss.
   By police count, 359 people have been killed and 1,393 wounded
since the fighting broke out March 8. It has been described as the
most destructive of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war, with damage
estimated at more than $300 million.
   In a joint statement issued at the end of Secretary of State
James Baker's visit to Moscow, the two superpowers said they ``are
prepared to provide good offices so that, jointly with other
states, they may promote a political solution to the problem of
Lebanon, taking into consideration the interests of all sides.''
   Syria and its allies have claimed that the barrages on the
Christian ports were to prevent three ships cruising in the
Mediterranean from unloading Iraqi supplies. Aoun has denied in the
past receiving arms from Iraq.
   Syria is Iraq's chief Arab enemy. Ruled by rival wings of the
Baath Party, the two governments are competing for influence in
Lebanon.
   Baghdad has openly declared support for Aoun's pledge to drive
Syria's 40,000 troops out of Lebanon. These soldiers control about
70 percent of Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Fighting flared two days after Aoun ordered a blockade of three
illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut to
recoup millions of dollars of customs dues.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt said in an interview published
today did not believe a settlement was possible.
   He told the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Watan: ``There is no solution
in Lebanon, but rather a long war interrupted by limited truces.''
   He criticized the six-member Arab League panel on Lebanon,
saying it was seeking ``a truce whereby Aoun replenishes his
arsenal, not a settlement.''
   He said the Christians were also receiving help not only from
Iraq but from Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization,
another enemy of Syria.

<HEAD>Ancient Teeth Found in Important Archaeological Discovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-Vietnamese scientific team has
found two human teeth believed to be 40,000 years old, an official
report said.
   The Vietnam News Agency reported the discovery in a recent
excavation at the Lang Trang Cave in the Ba Thuoc district of Thanh
Hoa province, 95 miles south of Hanoi.
   The report, dated Thursday, was monitored in Bangkok today.
   ``The teeth, one an incisor and the other a first molar,
unearthed from a layer of carbonate-rich clay sediment, are
believed to date to 40,000 years back, probably belonging to homo
sapiens,'' the report said.
   Recent archaeological finds have traced back about 500,000 years
the earliest human habitation of northern Vietnam.
   Also found in the sediment were animal fossils of 36 species and
23 families, the report said. It did not specify when the
discoveries were made.
   The team, set up by the Vietnam Archaeology Institute, included
Nguyen Van Hao, deputy head of the institute; paleontologist Le
Trung Kha; archaeologist John Olsen of the University of Arizona
and paleoanthropologist Russel Chioson of the University of Iowa.
   Olsen and Chioson were among scientists who in January journeyed
to Thanh Hoa to join Vietnamese scientists in searching a limestone
cave for remains of the ``gigantophithecus,'' an ape that became
extinct more than 200,000 years ago.
   They hoped to establish relationships among homo erectus, the
direct ancestors of modern humans, stone tools used by early man,
and the giant ape, since the remains of all three have been found
in that area.
   The excavation was one of the first joint scientific field
research projects in Vietnam in recent years. Diplomatic relations
have been blocked by Washington's opposition to Vietnam's
decade-old occupation of Cambodia, but private contacts have
increased substantially in recent years.

<DATELINE>SAN FERNANDO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspected Communist rebel has
admitted taking part in last month's killing of an American
colonel, but investigators have doubts about the confession,
military officials said today.
   Brig. Gen. Cesar Nazareno said Ricardo Prestosa, 29, made the
confession during interrogation today by military officials in
Bataan province, where Prestosa was arrested Wednesday.
   Nazareno, however, said no charges have been filed. A senior
officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Prestosa
repeatedly recanted and then repeated the confession and seemed
``confused.''
   Nazareno played a tape to reporters in which Prestosa told his
interrogator that the rebels killed U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick''
Rowe because he was a ``big hindrance to the revolutionary
movement.''
   Rowe, a Vietnam veteran who escaped from five years'
imprisonment by the Viet Cong, was gunned down April 21 while on
his way to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in the
Manila suburb of Quezon City.
   The communist New People's Army released a statement the
following day claiming responsibility for the slaying. It said the
rebels killed Rowe because of alleged U.S. interference in the
Philippine government's counter-insurgency campaign.
   Nazareno said Prestosa made the confession to Col. Ramsey
Ocampo, constabulary commander in Bataan, 40 miles west of Manila.
But Ocampo, in a telephone interview, denied Prestosa admitted
taking part in the killing.
   ``Negative,'' said Ocampo, reached by telephone at his Bataan
headquarters after Nazareno's news conference. ``Insofar as our
investigation is concerned, he (Prestosa) is denying it.''
   When The Associated Press told him about the Nazareno tape,
Ocampo said, ``I suggest you talk with Camp Olivas,'' the regional
headquarters.
   The line was suddenly cut. When The Associated Press reached
Ocampo's office later, aides said the colonel was ``out.''
   Ocampo said late Thursday that Prestosa had denied any
involvement in the assassination. He said intelligence officiers
believed Prestosa was not directly involved but ``may be in the
know'' about the assassination.
   In the tape played by Nazareno the voice said in Tagalog, the
local language, that he knew Rowe because ``we had been watching
him for a long time.''
   ``Why did you kill him?'' the interrogator asks.
   ``Because he was a big hindrance to the revolutionary movement.''
   Nazareno said Prestosa said he and five others were in the car
from which Rowe's vehicle was sprayed with bullets three blocks
from his office. He said they were armed with two M-16 rifles and
two pistols.
   But at least two details in Prestosa's alleged confession did
not jibe with fact.
   He says in the tape that Rowe was killed ``around 10 a.m.''
Police and witnesses said the killing occurred about at 7:10 a.m.
   The tape says also that the killers abandoned the car in
Manila's Paco district. But earlier, police said they found the car
in the San Francisco del Monte district, about four miles from Paco.

<HEAD>Sky Sniper Bought Assault Rifle on Day of Schoolyard Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of strafing the city while flying a
stolen airplane bought an assault rifle after watching reports
about a California schoolyard massacre, a newspaper reported today.
   Albert J. Hunter, who allegedly killed his wife and commandeered
the plane Wednesday, bought a semiautomatic rifle on Jan. 17, the
same day killer Patrick E. Purdy went on a rampage in Stockton,
Calif., The Boston Globe reported.
   Witnesses have identified the gun as an AK-47, but ballistic
experts studying the casings recovered from the strafing had not
confirmed that.
   A person who answered the telephone at Bob's Tactical Shooting
Range and Gun Shop in Salisbury, where authorities said Hunter
bought the gun, said, ``I don't know anything about it,'' and hung
up, the Globe reported.
   Hunter, a Vietnam veteran and armored reconaissance specialist
in Germany, worked at the U.S. Postal Service's South Postal Annex
in Boston.
   A co-worker there, who refused to give his name, told the Globe
that Hunter was impressed by the carnage created by Purdy, who
sprayed the schoolyard with bullets from an AK-47, killing five
children and wounding 30 before committing suicide.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has sought to ban assault
rifles in the state, and was expected to use Wednesday's incident
to back up his cause.
   Police believe Hunter used the AK-47 to kill his ex-wife,
Elvira, and to commandeer a Cessna 152 from a flight instructor at
Beverly airport. They said he fired randomly down at the city
during a three-hour flight over greater Boston, hitting buildings
and airplanes parked at Logan International Airport.
   Hunter pleaded innocent to murder and assault charges after his
capture Wednesday, and was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital for
20 days' psychiatric observation.

   The government today urged students not to hold
pro-democracy demonstrations when Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev visits China next week, and a spokesman said officials
are considering legislation to limit protests.
   Also today, a newspaper said Politburo member Hu Qili met with
reporters from the China Youth News, many of whom have been active
in a journalists' movement for freedom of the press.
   The China Youth News reported that Hu, responsible for
supervising China's state-run media, talked with the journalists
Thursday in ``a cordial, harmonious and friendly atmosphere.''
   It said Hu listened to their opinions, but it gave no details
about his reply.
   Earlier this week, Chinese journalists gave the government a
petition signed by more than 1,000 reporters requesting a dialogue
on censorship.
   Students have marched from their schools to Tiananmen Square
seven times during nearly monthlong protests for freedom and
democracy, and about 300 journalists took part in a similar
demonstration May 4.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu said he hopes students will not
disrupt the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   ``I'm sure that the overwhelming majority of the students will
proceed from the standpoint of maintaining the political and social
stability in China and act to protect the international prestige of
China,'' Yuan said.
   Leaders of the student campaign for democratic reforms have
indicated they may march to Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on
Monday, the day Gorbachev arrives.
   ``We have not ruled out a demonstration to express our support
for political reform,'' one activist said Thursday.
   Students at Beijing University by Thursday night had also
gathered 1,200 signatures for an open invitation to Gorbachev to
speak at China's most prestigious university.
   Yuan, speaking at a news conference devoted mainly to economic
matters, said if the students do march, ``I think that the correct
policies and approaches adopted by the Chinese government recently
will be continued to be pursued.''
   The government, after threatening a crackdown and mobilizing
troops early in the campaign, has acted with restraint. There has
been no serious attempt to stop the demonstrations and the
government has agreed to meet selected students to discuss such
issues as freedom of the press and official corruption.
   Activists, however, accuse the government of stalling in
responding to their demands that new independently elected student
groups be recognized and be given a voice in the dialogue.
   In a front-page editorial, the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the
Communist Party, also appealed today for calm and stability but
acknowledged complaints by students are real.
   ``More and more people have realized that there are problems
existing in our country, including the problems raised by students.
These problems can only be solved under circumstances of stability
and on the track of democracy and law,'' it said.
   Many Beijing students returned to classes this week after tens
of thousands demonstrated on May 4th, the 70th anniversary of
China's first democratic movement. However, large numbers of
students at Beijing University and other schools have continued
their strike.
   Yuan said the government is discussing the draft of a law on the
holding of demonstrations.
   Yuan said details of the law have yet to be worked out, but
``that law will be designed to both protect the exercise of civil
rights of citizens and at the same time protect social and state
interests.''
   China's constitution guarantees the right to demonstrate, but
since large student demonstrations in 1986-87 most Chinese cities
have passed regulations stating that planned street marches must
first receive the approval of local police.
   Police, citing traffic problems, rarely approve applications for
demonstrations and all the student rallies over the past month have
been technically illegal.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today he
welcomed the Soviet Union's offer to reduce its stockpile of
short-range nuclear missiles and tactical weapons.
   But Kohl, at the center of a divisive NATO dispute over the
short-range missile issue, urged the Kremlin to take further steps
to eliminate its superiority in conventional and nuclear forces.
   ``This proposal is certainly a step in the right direction,''
Kohl said in a statement. ``But we urge once again that the Soviet
Union work toward reducing its crass superiority in conventional
and nuclear forces.''
   ``We want to arrive at a point where the Soviet Union _ like
NATO already _ is no longer capable of launching a surprise attack
or an invasion,'' he said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Thursday offered to
unilaterally remove 500 tactical nuclear warheads from Eastern
Europe this year. He also proposed superpower negotiations on the
reduction of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Kohl's statement on the offer mirrored that of Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, who called Gorbachev's proposal ``a good
step, but a small step.''
   Kohl said Gorbachev's offer was in part the result of his
continued calls for such cuts.
   Baker described Gorbachev's decision to carry out a unilateral
reduction of 5 percent from an arsenal of 10,000 battlefield
nuclear weapons as a ``modest move.''
   The cuts Gorbachev intends to make this year _ without requiring
action by NATO _ include 284 short-range missiles, 166 nuclear
bombs carried by airplanes and 50 nuclear artillery shells.
   Gorbachev also proposed reductions in tanks, combat aircraft and
artillery pieces.
   Baker was in Brussels today to brief senior NATO officials on
the results of his visit to Moscow.
   He was expected to meet with West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who along with Kohl has urged early
superpower talks on the reduction of short-range nuclear weapons.
Most of the weapons are in West Germany.
   The United States and Britain have rejected the call, saying
that the Warsaw Pact was so far ahead in tactical nuclear weapons
and conventional forces that negotiations could not be considered
until the imbalance was significantly reduced.
   The dispute has split the alliance before a crucial NATO summit
to be held in Brussels later this month.
   The arms reductions proposals were expected to be a central
topic of conversation during talks today between Kohl and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who was in Bonn.
   In Moscow, the official Tass news agency said Shevardnadze would
discuss a document setting out the ``fundamental concept'' of
relations between the two countries.

   A guard at a military police training
center went on a shooting spree with an M-16 rifle and tossed two
grenades into a barracks today, killing three people and wounding
five before fleeing, police said.
   Cpl. Hung Yen-chin, 21, began the shooting spree before dawn
after he argued with a colleague who was taking over guard duty,
the Military Police Command said in a statement.
   After killing the other guard, Hung tossed the grenades and shot
at officers in a nearby barracks, according to the statement.
   Hung then escaped with his rifle, three hand grenades and 200
rounds of ammunition, it said.
   Officers searched the Taipei suburb of Hsintien where the
corporal was thought to be hiding but failed to locate him,
officials said.
   The injured were hospitalized in satisfactory condition,
officials said.
   They gave no motive for the shooting. The mass-circulation
United Evening News said the corporal had been reprimanded in the
past for unknown reasons.

   Two guerrillas of the African

   Dozens of youthful supporters of the black defendants disrupted
the proceedings by singing freedom songs in the courtroom at
Umtata, capital of the nominally independent tribal homeland of
Transkei.
   Pumzile Mayapi, 23, and Zonwabele Mdzamela, 28, were convicted
of two counts of murder in connection with the April 1986 explosion
at the hotel on the Transkei's Indian Ocean Wildcoast. A black
youth and a white man were killed when a limpet mine placed in a
toilet exploded.
   No execution date was set.
   The African National Congress was outlawed by the government in
1960 and the next year began a sabotage and bombing campaign to win
independence from the dominant white minority.

<HEAD>Report Deng To Retire After Gorbachev Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hong Kong newspapers reported today that
China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping will retire from political
life after his summit next week with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev next week.
   The Chinese language Ming Pao Daily News, which is respected for
its China coverage, quoted unidentified sources as saying Chinese
Premier Li Peng disclosed the 84-year-old Deng's retirement plans
at a meeting Tuesday in Beijing with Iranian President Ali Khamenei.
   Another Chinese daily, Sing Pao Daily News, said Communist Party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang will replace Deng as chairman of the
influential Central Military Commission, the only major official
post now held by Deng.
   It did not indicate whether Zhao would retain his party
chairmanship.
   Ming Pao said Deng no longer will meet foreign leaders after the
Gorbachev visit, which begins Monday, and will retire formally from
domestic politics.
   Deng has been in semi-retirement for several years and
repeatedly has said he would like to turn over power to younger
leaders.
   He is believed to be in declining health, and Ming Pao said his
doctors originally discourged him from meeting Khamenei so he could
conserve his energy for the Gorbachev visit.
   It said the Iranians pressed for a meeting and the Chinese
agreed.
   Reports from Beijing said Deng looked frail at the meeting,
which lasted only 20 minutes.
   Gorbachev will be the first Soviet leader to viist China in 30
years, when Beijing challenged Moscow's right to dominate the world
communist movement. The visit is expected to normalize relations
between the neighbors.

<HEAD>Mob Boss Scarfo Gets Longest Sentence of 55 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo
drew a 55-year sentence and a $500,000 fine in a racketeering
conspiracy case that investigators say crippled one of the nation's
most powerful Mafia families.
   In nine days of sentencing, a U.S. district judge handed out
sentences of 30 to 45 years to 15 of the 16 others convicted along
with Scarfo last November. Charges in the racketeering conspiracy
included 13 murders and attempted killings.
   An 18th defendant, before trial, pleaded guilty only to illegal
gambling and got a 3{-year sentence in a deal for leniency. One
convicted gangster won an indefinite delay in his sentencing when
he agreed to cooperate with the government.
   For the 59-year-old Scarfo, of Atlantic City, N.J., Thursday's
maximum sentence of 55 years imprisonment means he'll probably
spend the rest of his life behind bars.
   U.S. District Judge Franklin Van Antwerpen directed that the
sentence begin only after Scarfo completes a 14-year federal term
he is serving for a $1 million extortion attempt and a life term
for murder imposed last month by a Pennsylvania judge.
   Scarfo is said to be boss of a Philadelphia-South Jersey mob
considered to be one of the most powerful among the nation's 24 La
Cosa Nostra organizations.
   The government alleged that Scarfo, as a member of the Mafia's
national commission, was among the most powerful criminals in the
United States.
   David Fritchey, one of the five members of the government team,
told the judge ``the end of this mob family hasn't happened yet,
but it is severely crippled.''
   Scarfo's sentencing followed that of his nephew, Philip
Leonetti, 36, of Margate, N.J., who was identified as the mob
underboss. He drew the maximum 45-year term.
   The judge directed that Scarfo be sent to federal prison at
Marion, Ill.
   Scarfo stood impassively next to his lawyer, declining to
address the court, and merely shrugged his shoulders, in a gesture
of expectation, when the sentence was handed down.
   Scarfo was found guilty of participating in eight murders, four
attempted murders, 17 extortions, two drug deals plus bookmaking
and loansharking.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry arrived at an alleged crack
house with eviction papers in his hand and television cameras by
his side, surprising 16 people in the apartment and federal agents
who arrived an hour later to serve a search warrant.
   Barry directed city workers to nail shut the apartment's windows
and doors Thursday. Agents from the Treasury Department's Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms soon appeared and tore down the
plywood boards and ignored the ``No Trespassing'' signs erected by
the city.
   ``This is a classic case of no coordination,'' Lt. Reginald L.
Smith, a city police spokesman, told The Washington Post. ``You're
going to need coordination to fight this war on drugs and ... no
one's talking to each other.''
   Federal agents said their search warrant was based on a previous
alleged drug purchase at the apartment in the city's southeast
section, where drug-related violence has been high.
   ATF spokesman Dick Pedersen said both local and federal
authorities were just trying to do their jobs. ``If there is a
little overlap, that's OK. No one got hurt,'' he said.
   No one was found in the apartment in the federal raid and no one
was arrested in the city raid, conducted by police, Barry and more
than a dozen representatives of the city housing department.
   A small plastic bag containing what appeared to be 18 rocks of
crack cocaine, worth $50 each, was found in the middle of the front
room during the first raid and confiscated by police.
   Capt. Robert Boggs, who accompanied Barry and a handful of
reporters through the apartment, said he could not make arrests
based on such evidence.
   Barry said the home was being closed because the tenant listed
on the lease owes the city $1,200 in back rent and the apartment
had been the scene of a gunfight between an off-duty police officer
and two men Wednesday night.
   According to housing officials, police had raided the residence
twice before, in August and October 1988, and found guns and crack.
The tenant had been given two previous eviction notices, but
because of delays in the eviction process, he remained in the
building, they said.
   The mayor said he initiated the eviction after he heard over his
police radio a gunfight between an off-duty police officer and two
men in the neighborhood Wednesday night. He visited the housing
project that night and warned residents of the apartment, ``I'm
going to put you out.''
   Barry's administration has come under criticism for failing the
stem the increase in drug-related violence, and the White House has
chosen Washington as the focal point for a new national anti-drug
campaign.
   Barry himself has been criticized for his personal associations,
including his friendship with a former official of the U.S. Virgin
Islands government recently convicted of drug trafficking.

<TEXT>
   Once he was compared to Magic Johnson, but Lloyd
Daniels _ a National Basketball Association all-star in waiting _
never escaped the city streets where his game first flourished.
   Daniels was in critical condition today after a drug-related
shooting. It was the latest episode in a troubled 22-year life that
has taken him through five high schools, two rehabilitation centers
and, finally, to a hospital.
   Daniels reportedly was shot three times in the neck and torso
Thursday in a dispute over an $8 drug debt.
   Although his talent helped him receive chance upon chance to
straighten out his life, it might have aggravated some of his
problems, said a close friend of the 6-foot-8 Daniels.
   ``I definitely think certain things were overlooked because of
his talent,'' said Lou D'Almeida, a basketball fanatic who took
Daniels under his wing four years ago. ``He wasn't required to make
any decisions early on.
   ``That was the only problem he had _ trouble making the right
decisions. That, and pushing himself in school.''
   Academics were never Daniels' strong suit. ``I ain't allergic to
no school. I just don't want to go,'' he said.
   When he arrived at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in 1987,
Daniels could read at a third-grade level.
   Time magazine aptly summed up his diploma-less odyssey through
five high schools in three states: ``Each school had availed itself
of his talents on the court but never managed to solve his profound
reading problems.''
   As he got older, Daniels began making the wrong decisions: he
was arrested on a drug charge in Nevada. He began drinking heavily.
His work habits led to his release from two teams within three
months last year.
   But through the drinking, the drugs, the dropouts, Daniels had
one thing to hold on to: his game.
   At Andrew Jackson High School in New York City, ``Sweet Pea''
Daniels averaged 31.2 points, 12.3 rebounds and 10 assists per game
_ until quitting in February 1986.
   In a high school all-star game several months later, Daniels
limited Sean Higgins _ a key performer for champion University of
Michigan _ to 8 points while pouring in 24 himself.
   As he was refusing help from a drug rehabilitation program,
Daniels was scoring 16 points per game and showing glimpses of his
old skills with the Topeka Sizzlers of the Continental Basketball
Association. He wore out his welcome there in just 29 games and was
cut in February 1988.
   While sucking down a case of beer per day, he still averaged 27
points per game in the New Zealand Basketball Federation last year,
but his drinking led to his release in May 1988.
   ``He's as gifted a ball player as I've ever seen,'' said Jerry
Tarkanian, head coach at college basketball powerhouse UNLV.
``Without question, he could have been an NBA all-star every year.''
   Tarkanian compared his overall skills to those of Los Angeles
Lakers star Magic Johnson. St. John's University head coach Lou
Carnesecca _ who's handled such home-grown talent as Chris Mullin,
Mark Jackson and Walter Berry _ said Daniels was one of the
greatest players New York City had ever produced.
   Recently, Daniels was showing signs of making another comeback.
He visited the Tarkanian family on Christmas Day and appeared
clean, healthy and ready to play ball, Tarkanian recalled.
   But Daniels may be running out of chances _ if he hasn't run out
of them already.
   ``I'm just keeping my fingers crossed. Now he should learn his
lesson _ what else could be more scary than the possibility of
losing his life?'' asked D'Almeida. ``Hopefully, he'll come through
this.''

<HEAD>Group Reportedly Mails Cyanide Letters to Japanese Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspected right-wing group sent threatening
letters with packages of cyanide to 10 Japanese banks that
reportedly provided loans to Soviet bloc nations, news reports said
today.
   The nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun quoted unidentified
police officials as saying it was the first time they had dealt
with the group, which called itself ``Heisei Shimpuren.''
   The group sent the letters to the banks after the political
affairs magazine Shokun reported they had provided loans to the
Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, the newspaper said.
   The banks included Fuji Bank, Taiyo Kobe Bank, Sumitomo Trust
and Banking, and Mitsui Trust and Banking, the newspaper said.
   The Sankei Shimbun newspaper said the envelopes contained
packets of cyanide along with messages including ``Do not provide
funds to the USSR!'' ``If you do not stop, we will attack your
company!'' and ``Take the poison and die!''
   Police believe the group is made up of rightists, the Kyodo News
Service reported.
   The name Shimpuren is the same as that of a rightist group that
opposed the modernizing reforms of the Japanese government during
the late 19th century, Asahi said. Heisei is the name of the
present Japanese emperor's reign.
   Police said the letters were sent from various locations in
western Japan between May 1 and Wednesday, the newspapers said.
   Police officials refused comment on the reports.
   One of the four banks identified in the newspaper reports
confirmed having received a letter, but the others refused comment.

   An express train traveling from
Venice to Belgrade derailed today, killing three people and
injuring several others, the Tanjug news agency reported.
   The accident occurred at 6:17 a.m. about 90 miles west of
Belgrade, Tanjug said.
   The state-run news agency did not release details about the
cause or circumstances of the accident, nor the exact number of the
injured.
   Traffic on the rail line connecting Belgrade with the
second-largest Yugoslav city, Zagreb, was halted more than two
hours, Tanjug said.
   Zagreb is about 120 miles from the crash site.

<HEAD>Vietnam Says China Reneged on Promises Of Normalization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has reneged on a promise to
normalize relations with Vietnam if Hanoi withdraws its forces from
Cambodia, Vietnam's official Communist Party newspaper charged
today.
   The Nhan Dan newspaper said China backed away from a previous
pledge during talks in Beijing this week on Cambodia, where
Vietnamese forces are battling insurgents armed by China.
   The newspaper said that during the talks, the Chinese ``made an
overall solution to the Cambodian issue a condition for the
normalization of relations between China and Vietnam, urged Vietnam
to agree to the composition of a transitional government ... and to
resolve the question of the armies of the Cambodian factions.''
   ``Obviously, these demands of the Chinese side are inconsistent
with the position it has taken earlier,'' it said.
   It said that on March 1, 1985, China's Foreign Ministry issued a
statement saying: ``If the Vietnamese government decides to pull
out all of its troops from Cambodia, the Chinese side will, right
after the first withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, be ready to resume
negotiations between the two countries.
   ``At the same time, as more and more Vietnamese troops continue
to be withdrawn, the Chinese side will take practical steps to
improve its relations with Vietnam.''
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and overthrew the
fanatical Khmer Rouge, which is accused of killing tens of
thousands of people while trying to set up a Marxist agrarian
system. The Khmer Rouge now is one of three guerrilla factions
seeking to oust the Vietnamese-backed regime.
   Vietnam has promised to withdraw its troops from Cambodia by
Sept. 30. But the makeup of a transitional government and fears
that the Khmer Rouge will return to power have complicated the
talks.
   On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua
blamed Vietnam for the failure of the talks between the vice
ministers.
   He said the Cambodian issue is one of the major topics on the
agenda of the May 15-18 summit between Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and China's top leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. He
indicated China will ask the Soviets to urge Vietnam to withdraw
its troops and seek a comprehensive settlement.

<HEAD>Authorities Suspect Murder-Suicide in Family's Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATERLOO, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple and their three children who were
found in their home after being dead for more than a week died in
an apparent case of murder-suicide, police said.
   The bodies of David M. Fager, 34; his wife, Roxane, 31; and
their children, Bryce Allan, 16; Michael Edward, 11; and Melissa
Lynn, 9, were found Thursday in their locked home by authorities
who became suspicious because the children had not been in school
for days.
   The parents died of gunshot wounds to the head, said DeKalb
County Prosecutor Monte L. Brown. The children also died of
gunshots wounds, but no other details on their deaths were
available.
   A large-caliber handgun was found near David Fager's body,
police said.
   Police were unsure if the same weapon was used in each slaying.
   ``Until we do an autopsy and recover the bullets, we won't
know,'' Brown said. ``There is no reason to believe there was more
than one weapon.''
   Brown said he believed Fager had been unemployed for more than
six months. Mrs. Fager also is believed to have been unemployed.
   Neighbors said the family gave no indication of being troubled
or violent.
   ``They were just a beautiful family, beautiful people,'' said
Marcia Tomaszewski, who lives across the street from the Fagers in
this town of 1,900.
   The family apparently had been dead since May 3, Brown said.
That was the last time any of them was seen in public. School
officials alerted police.
   ``They contacted Waterloo police. The Waterloo police contacted
us. We obtained a court order to go into the house, and that's when
we discovered the bodies,'' Brown said.
   Police said they were no signs of forced entry and they had to
break in a door to enter the home.

<HEAD>Negotiators Hold Last Round of Talks Before Greek Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek and U.S. negotiators today suspended
talks on the future of four U.S. military bases in Greece and will
resume negotiations following elections next month, a government
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Sotiris Kostopoulos, did not say if any headway
had been made in the negotiations, the 17th round of talks on a new
bases agreement to replace a five-year accord that expired in
December.
   Kostopoulos said a date for the next round of talks would be set
``following an agreement between the two sides.'' The talks would
follow the June 18 elections, he said.
   In previous rounds, negotiations stalled because Greece insisted
the United States make assurances it would help solve Greece's
differences with Turkey.
   The neighbors have differences over military control of the
Aegean Sea, seabed mineral rights and the divided eastern
Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
   Western diplomatic sources said talks also have been stymied by
Premier Andreas Papandreou's decision to close an Air Force base
adjacent to Athens international airport and his pre-election
pledge to hold a national referendum on any new agreement.
   Under the old accord, Greece and the United States have until
June 1990 to reach an agreement before the bases are shut.
   Four U.S. military bases have operated in Greece since the ealy
1950s _ two near Athens and two on the southern Aegean island of
Crete.

<HEAD>Police Alcohol Training Session Embarrasses Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police department training session to
demonstrate the effects of alcohol went sour because of
insufficient supervision, resulting in one participant being
hospitalized after she passed out, the mayor says.
   Mayor Thomas D. Schneider said further disciplinary action is
expected because of the May 2 training session.
   ``Obviously, something went wrong with the way it was done,'' he
added. ``That drinking is supposed to be a controlled situation,
not getting sloppy, falling-down drunk.''
   The program was intended to educate 15 volunteer reserve
officers about effects of alcohol.
   Police Chief Robert A. Jones said three dispatchers and two
police officers drank alcohol. Reserve officers then observed their
behavior, gave sobriety tests and used a Breathalizer machine to
measure blood alcohol content.
   One dispatcher passed out and was taken by ambulance to
Community North Hospital, Schneider said Thursday. She was treated
and released.
   Officer Steve York, who is certified to teach the training
sessions, was in charge but Jones said Capt. Lana Robinson, in
charge of training for the department, should have been present.
   ``There was a lack of supervision,'' Jones said.
   Schneider said the incident disappointed him.
   ``What really just irks me to death is that the new reserve
officers have been given the impression this kind of conduct is
acceptable behavior when it is, in fact, totally unacceptable by
this administration,'' Schneider told The Indianapolis News.
   He said a supervisor should be held accountable. ``There is no
question that someone will have to pay.''
   But Jones said he did not blame Robinson for what happened.
   ``We all have to be broad minded enough to know that we are
human and we all make mistakes,'' he said.

<HEAD>China Plays Down Close Encounter Between Gorbachev, U.S. Navy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet officials said today they were not
concerned about the presence of U.S. warships in Shanghai on the
day Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is to visit China's largest
city.
   ``I don't think we should overestimate the importance'' of the
planned port call by the U.S. Navy during Gorbachev's visit, Soviet
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said.
   At least two warships from the 7th Fleet are to sail into
Shanghai the afternoon of May 18, when Gorbachev is to tour the
city on his final day in China.
   It will be only the second port call by U.S. naval vessels to
Communist China. The first was in 1986, to the Yellow Sea port of
Qingdao.
   Foreign diplomats see the port call as a clear signal by the
Chinese that better relations with the Soviet Union will not
interfere with China's strong ties with the United States.
   China has stressed that Gorbachev's visit, and normalization of
long-strained relations with the Soviet Union, will not affect its
ties with other countries.
   Gorbachev arrives Monday for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30
years.
   Yevgeny M. Primakov, director of the Institute of World Economic
and International Relations of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, also
denied any relation between the port call and the Gorbachev visit.
   ``There has been no request either from the Soviet leader or
from Chinese leaders to visit the ships at that time,'' he said.
   Primakov and other Soviet speakers at a news conference
emphasized the importance of Sino-Soviet rapprochement.
   ``This is not just another visit in the framework of times, but
of historic necessity,'' Primakov said.
   ``We are two socialist states faced with major challenges. Our
rapprochement will in one way or another make it easier to clarify
our difficulties.''

<HEAD>Man Found Guilty Of Killing Infant Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who set off a nationwide search when
he claimed his infant son had been kidnapped has been convicted of
murder in the death of the 3-month-old boy.
   A jury deliberated less than four hours Thursday before
convicting Steven Ray James, 37, in the death of Steven Roy James,
whose body was found wrapped in bedding weighted with rocks in the
marshes of the Bear River on Oct. 11, 1986.
   James let out a deep breath when the verdict was read and
proclaimed his innocence to reporters as he was led away. Several
of his relatives ran weeping from the courtroom when the decision
was announced.
   The defense maintained throughout the seven-day trial that the
baby was kidnapped Aug. 16, 1986, from James' car while he shopped.
   ``We thought very strongly that it would be an innocent verdict
on Steven,'' said Roy James Sr., the defendant's father.
   ``We're disappointed,'' said defense attorney Robert Gutke.
   Prosecutors did not comment after the trial.
   James, of Logan, rallied his northern Utah community when he
reported the baby kidnapped. Sixteen-thousand fliers were printed
and mailed by volunteers, the story was sent out with monthly gas
bills in three states and the baby's picture was printed on grocery
bags distributed to 600 stores.
   The jury will return Monday to decide if the crime was first- or
second-degree murder. It is the first time in Utah that a murder
trial has been divided into separate guilt phases.
   The prosecution is not seeking the death penalty and Judge Pat
Brian has agreed to a life imprisonment sentence in the event of a
first-degree murder conviction. Second-degree murder carries a
sentence of five years to life, to be determined by the state Board
of Pardons.
   In closing arguments, Deputy Cache County Attorney James Jenkins
told the jury that James had the motive and opportunity to kill the
baby and planned the slaying to salvage his deteriorating
relationship with the boy's mother, Victoria DeLeon.
   Medical examiners were unable to determine the cause of the
baby's death, and Gutke said the child might have been killed by
kidnappers or died of natural causes and was ``improperly disposed
of.''

<HEAD>Soviets Compare Sub Disaster To Challenger Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet submarine accident off Norway last
month was a product of the Cold War and a scientific tragedy
reminiscent of the Challenger space shuttle disaster, Pravda said
today.
   The official Communist Party newspaper said the accident, which
left 42 dead, showed once again that ``The Cold War, carried down
into the ocean's depths, devours not only billions of dollars,
rubles, pounds and francs, but thousands of seamen's lives, too.''
   In a separate report, the defense ministry newspaper Red Star
said a group of ships has been dispatched to the site where the
submarine sank to locate and inspect it. The Soviets say they have
not decided whether to raise the nuclear-powered ship, which was
carrying nuclear-tipped torpedoes.
   Soviet officials say the radiation level in the water
surrounding the site remains normal.
   Pravda devoted a full page today to the fate of the experimental
submarine Komsomolets, which sank April 7 after a fire broke out on
board.
   ``I would dare to say that the loss of this boat for our country
means the same thing as the loss of the shuttle Challenger for the
United States,'' wrote correspondent Nikolai Cherkashin.
   ``The Komsomolets was the first hydro-cosmic orbital station, so
to speak. It carried torpedoes only because there was no getting
away from the ongoing naval confrontation,'' Pravda said, adding
that ``the Komsomolets could have been a prototype of a new kind of
sea transport. Its crew were actually experimenters.''
   Western defense experts said soon after the submarine sank that
top scientists probably were on board because of its experimental
nature.
   Pravda did not specify what the submarine was working on.
   The newspaper said some of the money that will be saved with
Soviet defense cutbacks should go toward perfecting rescue systems
for sailors.
   The Pravda article, which gave a minute-by-minute account of the
accident, described how many of the sailors ended up in fatally
frigid water without protective gear because they did not believe
the submarine would sink.
   It described how the fire spread from one section of the
submarine to another, and how the crew, having emerged to the
surface of the boat, ``could not believe they would end up in the
icy water.''
   ``They all knew that the solid body of their submarine was the
most solid in the world,'' it said. ``They all knew that nowhere
and never do `burned' submarines sink in a few hours.''
   But the body of the submarine was shaken by explosions and soon
sank, Pravda said.
   The fire probably began with a short circuit, the government
newspaper Izvestia said soon afterward.

<TEXT>
   The first plane carrying
members of the Army's elite Bayonet Division took off today on a
non-stop flight for troubled Panama under President Bush's orders.
   The contingent of 50 soldiers who took off shortly after dawn
was part of a total of about 900 men from Fort Ord, bused to Travis
on Thursday and today for the flight to Panama. They will join
1,000 soldiers being sent by Bush from other U.S. bases to augment
the 10,000 troops already in Panama.
   ``Sure, yeah, I'm scared, but I'll do what needs to be done,''
said Pfc. Greg Rieth, a Cleveland native who wore camouflage
fatigues and face paint. ``We need to clean up the streets.''
   Bush said the deployment is intended to protect the lives of
Americans following bloody post-election attacks on opposition
leaders by supporters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The president also ordered all U.S. government employees and
their dependents living off military bases in Panama to be
relocated onto U.S. bases or to return to the United States.
   The C-5 Galaxy took to the air at 6:50 a.m., carrying about 20
trucks and other gear in addition to the camouflage-clad soldiers
participating in ``Operation Nimrod Dancer,'' named after a
biblical figure famed as a hunter.
   The men belong to the 7th Light Infantry Division, known for its
ability to move out quickly. Air Force Lt. Steve Turner said more
than a dozen planes were available at Travis today for the airlift.
   The last of the hundreds of soldiers from Fort Ord, on the
Monterey Peninsula, arrived in the pre-dawn hours today. The first
contingent began arriving at Travis shortly after 9 p.m. Thursday.
   The soldiers waited as the huge C-5 Galaxy cargo planes, the
biggest aircraft in the Air Force, took aboard trucks and trailers
that lined up in two rows to enter the plane through ramps in the
rear.
   The Galaxy, capable of carrying 100 tons, has a cruising speed
of 500 mph and is expected to make the flight to Panama non-stop,
said Capt. Thomas Williams.
   Similar scenes were played out elsewhere.
   In a staging area at Cherry Point Marine Air Station in
Havelock, N.C., about 150 Marines from Camp Lejeune massed at dawn
today for a five-hour flight to Panama. The first 40 men left
aboard four planes at midmorning.
   ``We are going down there to protect Americans and protect
innocent people from trouble they're having with their leader,''
said Lance Cpl. Rocco Petitti. ``I'm not going down there to get
into a firefight or a combat action, but whatever happens,
happens.''
   In Violet, La., a few miles downriver from New Orleans, the
cargo ship Bellatrix was being prepared to travel to Texas to pick
up more than 700 Panama-bound soldiers.
   ``They've been crewing up all night,'' said Roy LeBlanc, night
security supervisor at Violet Dock Port. The 726 members of the 5th
Infantry Division Mechanized at Fort Polk, in west-central
Louisiana, will travel in convoys to Beaumont, Texas, where they
will board the Bellatrix for the trip to Panama, Fort Polk
spokesman William Penn said Thursday.
   At Travis, the group heading for Panama includes about 100
cooks, medics and other support personnel.
   A mother and daughter waited for the convoy outside the Travis
gate holding cardboard signs that read: ``Good Luck'' and ``Hurry
Home.''
   Linda Sexson, 43, whose son is a submarine crewman based on the
East Coast, said she came ``because I'm a mother with a son in the
service and I just came out to say goodbye and good luck.''
   ``Having someone in the service makes you think about what
they're doing. It makes you feel it a little more personally,''
said her daughter, 19-year-old Nicole Fisher.
   Fort Ord officials got the deployment orders about
three-quarters of the way through the president's news conference
Thursday, said Army spokesman Jim Davis. They were not unexpected,
he said. ``When you're a rapid deployment force, you pay attention
to what's going on.''
   More than 1,100 Fort Ord soldiers were sent to Honduras on March
17, 1988, after the reported movement of Nicaraguan troops into
Honduras. They returned shortly afterward. In April of last year,
26 U.S. Army helicopters and 200 aviators and other workers were
sent to Panama to bolster protection of U.S. citizens.
   The 7th Light contingent being sent today includes one battalion
of light infantry, one battery _ or company _ of light field
artillery and one headquarters brigade, said a military spokesman.
   Fort Ord was placed on alert Wednesday evening and is capable of
dispatching soldiers within 18 hours of such an alert, officials
said.
   Many soldiers had time to notify their families, Davis said.
And, he said, a family support group met after the deployment began
and set up a telephone network to keep relatives informed of
developments.
   ``The wives become pros and they know to get ready for that,''
he said.
   Still, emotions were running high as the troops were moved out.
   Elizabeth Shepherd, asked how she felt about her husband's
departure, replied: ``Scared, because I'm stuck here with the kids
and I don't know what's going on.''

   The state's chief tax collector paid
$192.82 today to clear up a delinquent 1988 tax bill on a vacation
island lot in Florida's Panhandle, a spokesman said.
   ``It was a mixup which she is correcting today,'' said Jere
Moore, spokesman for Katie Tucker, executive director of the state
Revnue Department. ``She owns two lots down on St. George Island.
One is listed in her name and the other is listed in the name of
Dan and Katie Miller. The one in her name is the smaller one and
that's the one she owes the tax (on).''
   Miller, Tucker's husband, is president of the Florida AFL-CIO.
   Moore said she wrote a $1,169 check March 31, thinking it
covered both parcels. Taxes in Florida become delinquent April 1.
   ``Then she got another bill from the tax collector,'' Moore
said. ``She thought it was a mix-up and has been intending to get
in touch with the tax collector down there.''
   Franklin County tax collector Betty W. Sangaree, in office for
more than 20 years, read the owner's name on the delinquent tax
list Thursday.
   ``Katie Tucker,'' she said, pausing. ``Hey, that's my boss.''
   Tucker makes $83,620 annually as Florida's revenue chief. She
heads an agency that collects nearly $1 billion a month in sales,
gasoline and other taxes and supervisor local tax collectors.
   Because of the delinquent tax, Tucker's property has been on a
list of property up for grabs at a tax-deed auction next month.
   Residents can bid on the deeds and earn up to 18 percent
interest on their money until the back taxes are paid. If the taxes
aren't paid within two years, the holder of the tax deed can keep
the property.

   A community activist and clergyman from
Chicago's South Side has been convicted of sexually abusing a
teen-age foster son.
   The Cook County jury, which heard eight days of testimony,
deliberated more than seven hours before returning the verdict
Thursday night against the Rev. Paul Hall, a licensed foster parent
and founder of a boys club.
   He was found guilty of two counts of criminal sexual assault and
five counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. He was acquitted
on two aggravated abuse charges.
   Hall was indicted last year for sexual assaults against two boys
who lived at his home in South Holland.
   The trial involved only one of the youths, who said he was
repeatedly molested over 19 months. Hall, who testified in his own
defense, denied the charges. His attorney said the conviction would
be appealed.
   Hall remains free on bond until sentencing June 7. He faces 15
years to 30 years in prison.

   A dolphin with a strong maternal
instinct had to be isolated after she kidnapped a newborn dolphin
and refused to allow the natural mother near the baby, Marineland
officials said.
   ``This is the second time she's done that. She wants a baby so
bad,'' park spokesman Bill Puckett said Thursday. ``Liz is the one
that did the dirty deed.''
   Liz has since been returned to the main dolphin tank following
the abduction last month. Officials say the baby dolphin is now old
enough to fend for itself.
   The baby was abducted by Liz April 7 after a dolphin named Betty
gave birth in a 300,000-gallon tank that holds Marineland's 20
Atlantic bottlenose dolphins.
   Liz, who is believed to about 22, has never had any babies,
Puckett said. She apparently chooses Betty's babies to kidnap
because Betty is much weaker than the other adult females in the
tank.
   ``When Betty has a baby, Liz goes after it,'' he said.
   Soon after the dolphin was born, Liz swam in and pushed the
30-to 40-pound baby away from its mother.
   ``Just in that minute or two, Liz just swept right in there.
Betty tried to get the baby back,'' Puckett said.
   But Liz stayed between Betty and the baby.
   Officials worried that the baby would starve if it could not get
milk from its mother. That happened two years ago when Liz
kidnapped another of Betty's babies and the young dolphin died 13
days later.
   Officials drained most of the 12-foot-deep tank, scooped Liz
into a sling, and put her in a flume behind a gate.
   ``She stood right by the gate the whole time and pined for the
baby,'' Puckett said.
   Marineland officials returned Liz to the dolphin tank last week,
and they believe the young dolphin has bonded with its mother and
is strong enough to fend off Liz.
   ``We didn't see any ill effects at all. I think she (Liz) has
learned her lesson,'' Puckett said.

   Soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian and
wounded at least 10 others today in clashes in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab reports said.
   The worst confrontation came in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood
of Gaza City, where troops opened fire on stone-throwing youths,
Arab reports said.
   Mahmoud Awad Akraa, 24, was struck in the head with a bullet and
was dead on arrival at Shifa Hospital, doctors said. Five
Palestinians were injured in the Sheikh Radwan clash, officials at
Gaza City hospitals said.
   In other clashes, two Palestinians were wounded in Shajeih
neighborhood of Gaza City, one in the Rimal neighborhood of Gaza
City, one in the Nusseirat refugee camp, and one in El Bireh near
Ramallah on the West Bank, Arab reports said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   Akraa's death raised to at least 472 the number of Palestinians
killed since the Palestinian uprising began in December 1987.
Twenty-one Israelis have died.
   The clashes occurred in Gaza despite a curfew that confined the
strip's nearly 700,000 residents to their homes for a fifth
consecutive day.
   Also today, Israelis continued anti-Arab violence in the coastal
city of Ashdod, the hometown of Sgt. Avi Sassportaz, an Israeli
soldier found slain on May 7. Arab reporters said Israelis stoned
the cars of Palestinians as they passed.
   One Arab driver, Majdi Abu Jama, 21, was treated for a skull
fracture at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, doctors said. A passenger
also was injured, they said.
   In the West Bank, 23-year-old Abdulla Yamani and a passenger in
his car, 2-year-old Mohammed Masoud, were treated for cuts and
bruises at Tulkarem Hospital. Yamani told doctors that his car was
stoned by soldiers driving by in an army truck near the Tulkarem
refugee camp.
   The army said it had no report of the incident.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his Cabinet plan to meet
Sunday to set up guidelines for elections in the territories.
   Shamir has proposed elections to choose Palestinian
representatives who would negotiate with Israel on a period of
limited autonomy. Talks would follow three years later on a
permanent settlement.
   When it meets on Sunday, the 25-member administration likely
will sidestep controversial issues such as international
supervision and the participation of Palestinians from outside the
territories in the elections.
   ``What we are bringing are the main principles, the skeleton of
the plan, without getting into details,'' said a Shamir aide who
spoke today on condition of anonymity.
   Ministers of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc are expected to
approve the elections idea Saturday night, Shamir's spokesman,
Yossi Ahimeir, said. ``Maybe one or two will oppose, but the
majority support it,'' he said.
   Among the opponents is Ariel Sharon, the trade and industry
minister who has argued such elections would lead to a Palestinian
state and be a calamity for Israel.
   Ministers of the left-leaning Labor Party in the coalition
government approved the plan Thursday, with only two ministers
stating opposition.
   Once the plan is approved, it is to be conveyed to Dennis Ross,
an aide to Secretary of State James Baker III. Ross arrives
Saturday to meet with prominent Palestinians and brief Israeli
leaders on Baker's talks in Moscow with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Ross is expected to try to make the election plan more
attractive to Palestinians by urging Israelis to allow
participation of 140,000 east Jerusalem residents _ a concept that
has been opposed by Shamir.
   The Jerusalem Post said that in a letter to Foreign Minister
Moshem Arens 12 days ago, Baker called for Palestinians abroad to
also be allowed to participate.
   The Post said the participation of outside Palestinians is
rejected by Israeli officials who fear it would be tantamount to
involving the Palestine Liberation Organization, which the
government views as a terror group bent on Israel's destruction.

   A U.S. military newspaper today
quoted sailors as saying either brake failure or a distracted pilot
may have caused a U.S. Navy jet with a hydrogen bomb on board to
fall into the sea off Japan 24 yers ago.
   Stars and Stripes interviewed a former crewman of the U.S.
aircraft carrier involved in the Dec. 5, 1965 mishap. Philip G.
Weldon was a petty officer third class on board the carrier, the
Ticonderoga, when the Navy attack jet rolled off the deck about 80
miles from a Japanese island, the paper said.
   The bomb was lost in the sea.
   ``Some sailors on the deck claimed that the pilot, who was
killed in the accident, was reading a book and may have been
distracted,'' Stars and Stripes said. ``Weldon believes other
causes such as brake failure can't be ruled out.''
   Pentagon officials have confirmed the accident but given few
details on the loss of the plane or the 1-megaton bomb, which has a
force of 1 million tons of TNT.
   In Washington, Pentagon duty officer, Lt. Cmdr. Jim Kudla said
he had ``no information at this time'' about the report by the
Darmstadt-based newspaper.
   Weldon, 44, was quoted as saying the accident occurred as
sailors pushed the A-4E plane onto a hanger deck elevator during a
training exercise.
   The pilot had been in the cockpit for about an hour as sailors
loaded the bomb on the plane. Once the bomb was on board, members
of the crew backed the craft into the elevator to raise it to the
flight deck, Stars and Stripes, the unofficial U.S. military
newspaper, said.
   The elevator was open to the ocean and had no barrier at the
back. The pilot was supposed to apply the brakes, but about 50
sailors watched as the jet slipped off the egde, flipped nose-up
and dropped into the water, Weldon said.
   ``It all happened in a matter of seconds,'' the Stars and
Stripes quoted Weldon as saying.
   Weldon, a native of Lebanon, Ore., joined the Navy in 1963. At
the time of the accident he was assigned to the 51st Fighter
Squadron as an electronics technician, the newspaper said.
   Weldon, who now works as a librarian at a U.S. military
Elementary-Junior High School in Goeppingen, West Germany, left the
Navy in 1966, the paper said.

   More than 4,000 New Yorkers packed a church
today to say goodbye to Schools Chancellor Richard Green, who died
this week after 14 months of running the nation's largest school
system.
   The memorial service began with a student choir singing ``You've
Got a Friend'' and the church organist playing two of Green's
favorite songs _ ``The Greatest Love of All'' and ``Reach Out and
Touch.''
   ``He inspired a lot of young people with a zest and optimism and
enthusiasm,'' said Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins upon
arrival at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
   Serving as honorary pallbearers for Green were the schools
superintendents of Atlanta; Detroit; Chicago; Newark, N.J.;
Memphis, Tenn.; and Tucson, Ariz. The Rev. Paul Moore, Epsicopal
Bishop of New York, and Rev. James Park Morton, dean of the
cathedral, conducted the service.
   On Thursday, hundreds of New Yorkers solemnly walked past
Green's bronze-colored, open casket and paid their respects to the
late schools chancellor. His funeral will be held in Minneapolis.
   City leaders on Thursday stood next to teachers and students
alongside Green's open casket at the Cathedral of St. John the
Divine. Green died early Wednesday after an asthma attack. He was
52.
   A memorial service was scheduled for today in the cathedral. The
funeral will be held later in Minneapolis, where Green spent most
of his life.
   ``I think what he left is the spirit of rejuvenation of our
school system,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch said outside the cathedral.
``He commenced it and someone now will have to pick up his mantle
and carry on.''
   Another mourner was 11-year-old Jason Lewis. He said the news of
Green's death upset many of his classmates at P.S. 51, who were
scheduled to see the chancellor this week to plan a Mother's Day
surprise for their moms.
   ``Everybody was crying. I was crying too,'' said Lewis. ``It was
a tragedy it happened.''
   Green became the first black to head the city's schools in March
1988, after a 4{-month search for a new chancellor. Board of
Education President Robert F. Wagner Jr. suggested Wednesday that
the same search committee that selected Green pick his successor.
   Nathan Quinones, chancellor in 1984-88, said gender and race
should be a key factor in filling the job.
   ``I think the outpouring here is the best example of the effect,
the sense of strength, the model he played as a strong black
male,'' he said of Green.

   A former Teledyne Electronics lobbyist
was sentenced Friday to six months in prison for his role in a
scheme to pay bribes for inside information about a defense
contract.
   Michael J. Savaides, 41, former Washington representative of
Teledyne, was also fined $8,313 by U.S. District Judge Claude
Hilton for his guilty plea to conspiracy to pay bribes.
   Hilton said Savaides could serve half his sentence in a
community-based facility but placed him on two years' probation
following the term of imprisonment.
   Savaides, who is cooperating with the Justice Department's
``Operation Ill Wind'' investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud,
could have been given a five-year sentence and fined $250,000.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica did not oppose a
defense plea for leniency, noting Savaides' cooperation with the
probe.
   Last month, Savaides testified at the trial of three Teledyne
executives who were accused of participating in the bribery scheme.
   Two of the executives were convicted of conspiracy and wire
fraud but were cleared of bribery charges. A third executive was
acquitted of all charges.

<TEXT>
   The state Commission on Judicial Conduct has made
public allegations against a state judge who enraged gay activists
and civil rights groups with his remarks about homosexuals.
   After a court hearing Thursday, lawyers for District Judge Jack
Hampton and the commission said they had agreed to release the
contents of ``formal proceedings'' sparked by more than 2,000
complaints against the judge.
   The allegations cite comments Hampton made in December to the
Dallas Times Herald and The Associated Press and remarks court
personnel in Hampton's office allegedly made to callers protesting
the judge's statements.
   Hampton told the newspaper he gave a lighter sentence to
convicted killer Richard Bednarski, 18, partly because his two
victims were ``queers.''
   The commission charges allege that Hampton's remarks violated
the Code of Judicial Conduct, which prohibits a judge from publicly
commenting on a pending case. Hampton also is charged with
violating the code that requires a judge to conduct himself in a
manner that promotes public confidence in the impartiality of the
judiciary.
   The hearing Thursday was before special master Robert Murray, a
retired judge from San Antonio appointed to handle the case.
Hampton was not present.
   Bednarski was convicted of killing Tommy Trimble, 34, and John
Griffin, 27, and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He could have
received a maximum life sentence.
   ``I don't care much for queers cruising the streets picking up
teen-age boys,'' Hampton told the Times Herald. ``I've got a
teen-age boy.''
   The same day that was published, he told AP Network News: ``The
victims were homosexuals. They were out in the homosexual area
picking up teen-age boys. Had they not been out there trying to
spread AIDS around, they'd still be alive today.''
   The allegations also refer to citizens who called Hampton's
office to protest his remarks. The callers were referred to a
Dallas attorney's office and told to ``have a gay Christmas,'' the
commission alleges.
   That response, commission documents state, was ``cavalier,
disdainful and undignified.''
   The commission announced in February its decision to initiate
formal proceedings against Hampton.
   Murray will report to the 11-member commission, then the panel
could dismiss the complaint, issue a public censure or recommend
the judge's removal.

<TEXT>
   A Cheyenne-Arapaho woman, choking back tears,
told a Senate committee today she lost her home and children
because her royalties from federally managed oil wells stopped
without explanation.
   Mary Limpy, speaking before a special investigating committee of
the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, said she is living
in an abandoned house in Oklahoma City, Okla., and lost custody of
her two youngest children because she could not pay her bills.
   The checks were small, but she used them to support her family,
said Mrs. Limpy, who is disabled from polio and ineligible for
welfare programs as long as she is on the oil royality rolls.
   Her three wells are managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but
when she went to the agency to find out why her checks stopped,
they could not help her, she told the committee.
   Mrs. Limpy is part of a federal class-action lawsuit charging
that the government is not living up to its trust responsibilities
to Indians with oil well interests, said attorney Steve Moore.
   That lawsuit has been held under advisement of the judge for two
and a half years, Moore said.
   On Thursday, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz, chairman of the
special committee announced that the Navajo Indian nation may be
owed as much as $5 million in back taxes from companies that have
purchased oil from its property.
   The committee discovered the tax error during its investigation
of oil theft and royalties underpayment by companies doing business
on Indian land.
   DeConcini said it appears taxes owed the Navajos have been
miscalculated for eight years.
   ``Let me make clear that we have found no evidence that the oil
companies themselves intentionally misstated the amount of taxes
paid, or even that the oil companies were the source of the
possible misinformation,'' DeConcini said.
   He said the committee alerted the tribe and will assist it in
making the correction needed to collect the money and ensure the
problem isn't repeated.
   DeConcini's announcement, which came on the third day of
hearings about Indian oil, hinted at the extent of confusion over
royalty and tax payments.
   ``Accounting errors are rampant in the industry,'' said Randy
Fetterolf, an oil and gas expert working as a consultant to the
committee. Companies are so busy finding, producing and selling oil
that they don't have time to perform the intricate but necessary
accounting procedures, he said.
   Fetterolf called the oil industry a ``boom and bust'' business
and said many companies that failed to pay royalties are now
bankrupt.
   DeConcini and committee member Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have
been highly critical of the three agencies charged with protecting
Indian oil rights _ the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of
Land Management and the Minerals Management Service.
   Chuck Norman, a committee investigator, said Thursday that the
Minerals Management Service was ``a model of efficiency'' compared
to the other two agencies.
   However, he said the service fails to catch improper valuation
of oil and improper deductions that companies make from the
royalties they are supposed to pay.
   Norman said unlike the IRS, the minerals service doesn't have
any built-in signals to alert it to illegal deductions.
   He says companies are allowed to deduct some expenses from
royalties, but evidence exists that the privilege may be abused.
   Furthermore, said Norman, ``there is a very serious problem with
the MMS penalty system.''
   He said in the last seven years, the service imposed 35
penalties on Indian and non-Indian public land, but only collected
five, none of which were on Indian land.
   Norman said that because of a loophole in the law, companies
that fail to pay their penalties escape unscathed.
   Earlier in the day, witnesses from the Southern Ute tribe in
Colorado described how they took over management of their oil wells
because of the federal government's failure to do the job.
   Tom Shipps, attorney for the Southern Utes, told the committee
he didn't trust the minerals service to effectively police royalty
payments. His tribe uses its own accountants to audit oil
transactions.
   Norman praised the work of the Southern Utes.
   ``What needs to be encouraged is more autonomy for the Indians,
like the Southern Utes,'' said Norman.

   A Dutch soldiers' union on Friday
called for the government to cut the draft time by one-quarter,
citing inefficiency and boredom.
   The government, however, won't consider such a move because of
NATO commitments on military training and personnel strength, said
Defense Ministry spokesman Hans Schonau.
   The draft period for lower ranks could be cut from 14 to 10
months, because at least 25 percent of a conscript's time is
squandered, said union spokesman Frans Vergouwe.
   Concripts make up 49,000 of the Netherlands' 65,000-member armed
forces.
   A union poll of 408 drafted men showed 56 percent thought they
worked inefficiently. Thirty percent said they routinely completed
their day's work in four hours instead of the regulation eight,
Vergouwe said.
   More efficient use of time would allow for shorter army stints,
he said.

   Tan Sek Cheong, 50, a rubber and palm oil dealer, was arrested
in possession of 3.63 ounces of the drug in 1983 and convicted in

   The death sentence is mandatory for anyone found with at least
.525 ounces of heroin, Yew said. Since the law was introduced in
1975, 22 people have hanged.

   A dozen baby boa constrictors were
stolen from a zoo this week, and police believe they probably were
freed in the countryside.
   The potentially giant tropical snakes would have little chance
of surviving.
   The 19 King Boas were hatched April 18 at Dyreparken zoo in
southern Norway.
   Gunnar Vang, of the Kristiansand Police, said there was no trace
of the snakes or suspects.

   About 10,000 U.S. and Thai soldiers
will take part in an annual exercise to test their readiness in
case of an invasion of northeastern Thailand, Radio Thailand said
Friday.
   The joint exercise, codenamed ``Cobra Gold '89,'' will take
place May 23 to June 21 in Baan Darn Larnhoi distict in the
northern province of Sukhothai, about 225 miles north of Bangkok,
the station said.
   The Thai director of the exercise, Lt. Gen. Somkit Chompayuha,
said new defense technology including the detection of targets with
laser beams would be used in the exercise.
   The exercise will be the eighth of its kind. About 15,000 troops
took part in one last year.

   Thanks to an invitation to dinner at a restaurant,
construction worker Jaime Polomo got to meet his son's first-grade
teacher and tell her why he had not gone to school for conferences
this year.
   ``I work all day,'' he said. ``At night, I study English.''
   Polomo; his wife, Valentine; their son, Jaime; and teacher Jean
Smith-Andrade had dinner courtesy of local businessman Phil Garvin,
who has sponsored more than 100 such teacher-parent dinners.
   Garvin gave Jose Valdez Elementary School $10,000 from his
television production company, Norac Productions Inc., to encourage
the six first-grade teachers to take their students and the
students' parents out to dinner.
   ``We wanted to start this the first year that kids have homework
so we can set in motion, hopefully for the rest of their lives,
this communication between teachers and parents,'' he said.
   Seven-year-old Jaime said his first-grade classmates all were
talking about these teacher-parent dinners and he was excited.
   Garvin said that enthusiasm and the occasion is what his
investment is all about.
   ``That's it _ if the exciting thing of the year can be a meeting
with the teacher, that's it: Education is important,'' said Garvin.
   The dinners are meant to be ``a special occasion'' that ``sends
a clear message to the parents: ``hey, you can make a difference,'
'' Garvin said.
   Mrs. Polomo, who had met the teacher a few times before, said
the dinner provided ``time to talk. When you go to school, you have
about 15 minutes to talk with the teacher and that's all.''
   Garvin lives in the comfortable suburb of Englewood but does
business a few blocks from the school north of downtown Denver. He
said he wanted to put something back into the poor, largely
Hispanic neighborhood, where teachers say about 60 percent of
first-graders speak Spanish at home.
   Garvin said he was disturbed by news reports in recent years of
a decline in the quality of American public education.
   ``I was reading all these studies that say that the big
difference between a successful school and an unsuccessful school
is parental involvement,'' he said.
   He said his interest in helping education was inspired partly by
the example of New York City businessman Eugene Lang, who pays for
college for students who graduate from the Harlem high school Lang
attended. He said he also was moved by the movie ``Stand and
Deliver,'' about Los Angeles super-teacher Jaime Escalante.
   When Garvin suggested his dinner plan to Valdez officials last
Christmas, his business already had been giving $10,000 a year for
the past three years to nearby North High School to reward good
teaching. Under that program, five teachers receive $2,000 grants
each.
   The dinners generally have drawn rave reviews.
   Some parents said it was the first time they had eaten in a
sit-down restaurant.
   Teacher Josie Garcia, who has 16 students and was able to
arrange 15 dinners, said that at one of her dinners the student's
father worked in the restaurant kitchen and got time off to come
out for the occasion.
   ``We found out how hard the parents work,'' said teacher Amy
Pleasant-Phillips. ``We sort of knew it, but weren't aware quite
how hard they work _ how much of their time is spent paying the
rent.''
   ``It gave us a realistic picture of where the priorities are,''
said Garcia. ``Most parents are very involved with their children,
but it's very hard for them to find time to help them with school.''
   Teachers said they talked to parents at dinner about the
importance of education and ways parents can help their children:
from making sure they have a place to do homework to reading with
them for even 10 minutes a night.
   Said Smith-Andrade: ``We tell them that attitude is an important
part. A parent doesn't need to take much time _ just show they
care.''
   She said many parents in the area are recent immigrants, and
many are dropouts. Such parents tend to be intimidated by teachers
and school authorities.
   ``A restaurant is neutral ground,'' she said.
   For the children, the dinners are events. One child wore an
Easter bonnet, and others talked for days about what they would
wear and what they would order to eat, teachers said.
   When asked what they enjoyed most about the dinner, a group of
five children answered unanimously: ``ice cream.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today accepted a
reported $100 million settlement of lawsuits stemming from the 1986
Dupont Plaza Hotel fire that killed 97 people on New Year's Eve.
   U.S. District Court Judge Raymond L. Acosta did not disclose the
amount of the settlement but said he was ``generally satisfied''
with it.
   Agreement in the case, involving about 2,300 plaintiffs from
across the country seeking damages from at least 200 defendants,
was reached Tuesday and approved Thursday night by District Judge
Louis C. Bechtle in Philadelphia.
   U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist had appointed
Bechtle to head the negotiations. Bechtle was the presiding judge
in a similarly complex case for the 1980 MGM Grand Hotel fire in
Las Vegas that left 84 people dead. The settlement in that case
totalled $200 million.
   An envelope with the settlement was handed to Acosta on
Wednesday.
   Plaintiffs in the case, tried in U.S. District Court in San
Juan, had sought damages of $1.8 billion.
   A former hotel maintenance worker pleaded guilty to setting the
Dupont Plaza fire during a labor dispute at the 22-story hotel,
which was packed with almost 1,000 tourists. About 140 people were
injured.
   The hotel was cited for 25 violations by the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, including lack of emergency exits from
the casino, where 84 of the victims died.
   Under the agreement signed in Philadelphia, $50 million will be
paid by the insurer, American International Underwriters Corp., and
$35 million by the so-called Dupont-family group of partnerships
and individuals who owned many hotel enterprises, including the
Dupont Plaza. Other insurance carriers will pay the remaining $15
million.
   The settlement halted a complex trial in San Juan that focused
on who owns the hotel and who is liable for damages.
   Acosta said the agreement was ``fully binding on all parties''
but contingent on certain unspecified conditions being met within
60 days. He said the jury will be recalled July 14 to learn whether
those conditions have been met and whether the trial should move on.
   In the meantime, Acosta issued a 60-day stay against all claims
in the case.

<HEAD>Precautionary Evacuation Ordered After Train Derails in Mississippi</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with officials saying now that large amount

material. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 200 people were out of their
homes today after a MidSouth Railroad train derailed and spilled
thousands of gallons of antifreeze and diesel fuel into the Chunky
River, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported in the derailment, which occurred
about 8:30 p.m. Thursday 10 miles west of here. But officials said
the chemicals and diesel fuel that leaked near and into the river
created a pollution hazard. Booms were placed downriver from the
spill site to catch leaking fuel.
   The evacuees, who included 22 nursing home patients and about
200 other people, may have to stay away from their homes until
Sunday, authorities said.
   ``We now estimate that 20,000 to 25,000 gallons of ethylene
glycol alcohol _ antifreeze _ got into the river along with 3,000
to 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel,'' said Eleana Turner, spokeswoman
for the Mississippi Bureau of Pollution Control.
   Investigators did not know what caused the derailment, which
involved 12 cars and three engines. Two of the engines fell into
the river, which runs parallel to the railroad tracks.
   ``We have directed a precautionary evacuation in a one-mile
radius around the derailment site,'' said Jim Maher, director of
the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.
   Six of the derailed cars carried the ethylene glycol alcohol, or
antifreeze. At least three leaked, but it was believed that only
one of the three spilled a significant amount of the chemical, said
Dusty Perkins, a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management
Agency.
   Authorities told people downstream from the derailment to stay
away from the river and keep livestock away from it, because
drinking high concentrations of antifreeze can be fatal. The booms
set up to contain the diesel fuel would not stop the antifreeze,
Perkins said, but the water would eventually dilute it.
   ``Our concern now is a pollution concern, rather than a public
safety concern,'' Perkins said. ``Nobody is going to breathe any
toxic fumes from this and die, but we don't know what will happen
to the river.''
   A car containing about 20,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide, a
powder also called caustic soda that is used in a variety of
industries, spilled right next to the river.
   Perkins said first reports indicated some of the caustic soda
had entered the river but ``we have a correction from the scene
that it has been contained and did not get into the Chunky.''
   Sandy Metrolis of the Lauderdale County Emergency Management
Agency said some people on the scene complained of burning eyes and
a strong odor, but ``as far as the effect on the river, I don't
know,'' she said.
   Four derailed cars carried vinyl chloride, but they weren't
leaking, while the 12th derailed car had plastic beads that would
be hazardous only if burned.
   Perkins said that the federal Environmental Protection Agency
was bringing in sampling equipment to determine the spill's effect
on the river.
   Lauderdale County Deputy David Taylor said a community center in
Meridien was set up as a shelter for the 200 people who live within
a mile of the derailment site.

   A social worker called on Dalila Ayari, but the woman locked

   Firefighters spread nets below the balcony in case the woman
jumped, but Mrs. Ayari, 32, ran to the other side of the apartment,

<TEXT>
   A Chinese bishop who spent 30 years in jail
for his religious activities met Friday with Pope John Paul II and
said he felt ``full of happiness.''
   Bishop Ignatius Kung said he and the pontiff discussed the Roman
Catholic Church in China, which the bishop said suffered ``many
difficulties.''
   Kung, 88, was released from prison in 1985, reportedly following
an appeal from the Vatican. His political rights were restored in
1988.
   The Vatican appointed Kung bishop of the Shanghai Diocese in
1950. He was arrested in 1955 on treason charges and sentenced to
life in prison for leading ``a counterrevolutionary clique under
the cloak of religion.''
   China severed relations with the Vatican in 1957 and allows
worship only under the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church, which
consecrates its own bishops. The church claims more than 3 million
members.
   Many other Catholics secretly remain loyal to the pope.

<HEAD>Arab League Tries to Preserve Truce; Syrians Shell Coast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Arab League envoys shuttled between
Christian and Moslem sectors Friday to try to settle a dispute over
the terms of a cease-fire and keep the rivals from rekindling their
war.
   The Arab League's latest truce, the fifth in more than two
months of fighting, was tested by minor shelling fired from Syrian
positions at the coast of the Christian enclave north of the city.
   A police spokesman said the shelling was ``a clear message that
the Syrians would not allow any ship carrying Iraqi weapons to dock
at ports in the enclave.''
   Syria accuses Iraq of aiding the Christian forces.
   The police spokesman said Syrian gunners fired six rockets at
the Christian coastline north of Beirut. The 122mm Grad rockets
``exploded in several locations of the coast, causing damage, but
no casualties,'' said the spokesman.
   In the fighting since March 8, police said 359 people have been
killed and 1,393 wounded.
   Rockets also fell on the coastline, but there were no immediate
reports of casualties or damage.
   The 20,000-member Christian army units under Gen. Michel Aoun
did not respond to the Syrian fire, the spokesman said.
   Aside from the firing, the cease-fire that went into effect
Thursday was ``holding along all frontlines. No violations were
reported,'' said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity
under standing rules.
   The four-man Arab League delegation headed by Lakhdar Ibrahimi
held talks with Moslem and Christian leaders in west and east
Beirut to ``facilitate and expand the cease-fire accord,'' he told
reporters.
   Ibrahimi said his talks aim at ``stabilizing the security
situation to allow the Arab committee to deal with Lebanon's
political problems.''
   He would not answer reporters' questions.
   Sources in the Cabinet of acting Premier Salim Hoss, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the Arab envoys were discussing
conflicting demands about the deployment of the 321-member Arab
observer force organized by the Arab League.
   There are ``two main deployment plans, one proposed by Syria and
the other by Aoun,'' said one source. ``They are concentrating
their talks on a compromise plan accepted by all the parties.''
   The Syrian-proposed plan, the source said, calls for deploying
the observers at ports in the Christian enclave to try to prevent
ships carrying Iraqi weapons and ammunition from re-supplying
Aoun's forces.
   Aoun, in a counterproposal, called for their deployment along
Lebanon's extensive border with Syria and at the Syrian-controlled
Beirut airport in the city's Moslem sector ``to monitor the
Syrians' moves,'' the source said.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe, supports Aoun's declared ``war of
liberation'' to drive Syria's 40,000 troops out of Lebanon.
   Ibrahimi, an Algerian, represents Arab League Secretary General
Chedli Klibi. He was accompanied by Kuwaiti diplomat Abdel-Aziz
Jassem and the observer group's military commanders.
   The team met in west Beirut separately with Hoss, who heads the
Moslem Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government, and Shiite Moslem
leader Nabih Berri.
   The team crossed to Christian east Beirut for separate talks
with Aoun, who heads the Christian cabinet, and the Lebanese Front
alliance of right-wing Christian political parties.
   The latest fighting erupted March 8, two days after Aoun ordered
a blockade of three illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias
south of Beirut.
   Militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.
   Syrian gunners later joined in the shelling.
   The United States and the Soviet Union, in a joint statement,
they were prepared to help find a settlement.
   The statement, issued at the end of U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III's visit to Moscow, said the superpowers ``are
prepared to provide good offices so that, jointly with other
states, they may promote a political solution to the problem of
Lebanon, taking into consideration the interests of all sides.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Cranston accused
Ambassador-designate Donald Gregg today of deliberately misleading
Congress and perhaps lying under oath about his involvement in the
illegal resupply of the Contra rebels while serving as intelligence
chief to then-Vice President George Bush.
   Leveling a barrage of accusations against Gregg, Cranston,
D-Calif., said an intensive investigation and an examination of
documents submitted during the trial of Oliver L. North leads him
to believe that Gregg sponsored ``a free-lance covert operation out
of the vice president's office'' to illegally resupply the Contras
in their fight against the leftist government in Nicaragua.
   Gregg said Cranston's characterization, based on Gregg's
friendship with former CIA operative Felix Rodriguez, was
inaccurate.
   ``I think it is a rather full-blown example of a conspiracy
theory,'' Gregg said of Cranston's comments. ``That's not what I
was doing. It is not what Felix was doing to my knowledge. My job
was to keep the vice president informed. I did not have operational
responsibility for anything. ... To do that would have been the
quickest way for me to lose my job.''
   Gregg said Bush ``made it clear'' that Gregg's job was ``sitting
and listening and reporting.'' He said he did not learn until
August 1986 that Rodriguez was involved in assisting the Contra
military resupply operation and that he didn't learn until December
1986 that North had recruited Rodriguez in September 1985 to assist
that effort. Gregg said he thought Rodriguez' efforts were focused
on assisting the Salvadoran military combat guerrillas.
   Cranston told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the
investigation has raised so many questions about Gregg's
credibility and truthfulness that many senators believe he is not
qualified to become U.S. ambassador to South Korea, the post to
which President Bush has nominated him.
   North, during his trial, contradicted the sworn testimony of
Gregg, who says he didn't find out until August 1986 that North was
assisting the Contras.
   Cranston asked why senators, ``who it appears that you have
systematically misled, should now be asked to reward your actions
and entrust you with the position of ambassador of the United
States?''
   Cranston said that he asked Secretary of State James A. Baker
III weeks ago to withdraw the Gregg nomination so an airing of
allegations against the nominee would not be necessary.
   ``Since this nomination is now before us we must now endeavor to
make clear whether you, Mr. Gregg, have played any part in
deliberate efforts to deceive the Congress,'' Cranston said.
   In his lengthy opening statement, Cranston said he is now
prepared to expand the investigation to include Gregg's other
activities while working as a national security adviser in Bush's
vice presidential office.
   He said these include Gregg's activities relating to Honduras,
Panama and the secret U.S. arms sales to Iran.
   ``If we are obliged to, we will explore all of these, and
consider calling other witnesses to obtain sworn evidence,''
Cranston said.
   Gregg, in a 21-page prepared opening statement, made no
reference to any of the issues raised by Cranston and spoke only
about U.S. relations with South Korea.
   Cranston challenged Gregg's previous congressional testimony
that prior to the revelation of the secret arms sales to Iran and
the diversion of a portion of the profits to the Contras in
Nicaragua in November 1986, ``you and the vice president `had never
discussed the Contras. We had no responsibility for it. We had no
expertise in it.'''
   He said Gregg, a 30-year veteran of the Central Intelligence
Agency, had also told a U.S. District Court that he ``had no
respoonsibility'' to Bush for Central American issues.
   ``Yet, the committee is now in receipt of memos under your name
which indicate that your involvement in the promotion of Central
American activities did not, in fact, end when you joined the vice
president's staff,'' Cranston said.
   
   Four months after joining the Bush staff, Cranston said Gregg
gave ``enthusiastic written support'' for a 1982 proposal by
Rodriguez ``to conduct helicopter strikes against a wide range of
Central American targets.''
   On Sept. 19, 1984, Cranston said, Gregg wrote a memo briefing
Bush on sources of Contra resupply.
   In April 1986, he said, Gregg wrote a memo setting up a meeting
for Rodriguez to brief Bush on ``the status of the war in El
Salvador and resupply of the Contras.''
   Cranston noted that 18 months earlier the Boland amendment
barring certain U.S. personnel from any involvement in military
resupply of the Contras had gone into effect.
   Cranston ticked off memo after memo, all of which he said
indicate Gregg played a far greater role in Central American
activities than he has publicly acknowledged.
   ``We could go on to explore the other glaring contradictions in
your sworn testimony _ and we will,'' Cranston said.
   ``But at a certain point your repeated denials and professions
of ignorance take upon themselves a certain `the dog ate my
homework' refrain,'' the senator said.

<HEAD>Students Vow Hunger Strike Two Days Before Gorbachev Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Friday called for calm during the
visit of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but students vowed to
stage a mass hunger strike until the government agrees to discuss
democratic reforms.
   Students at Beijing University and two other schools said they
will march to Tiananmen Square on Saturday to begin the hunger
strike. They pledged to remain there until authorities agree to
``sincere dialogue'' on their demands.
   Gorbachev is to arrive Monday for the first Sino-Soviet summit
in 30 years.
   At Beijing University, students crowded around a table in a
dormitory hall to sign up for the hunger strike.
   ``We're not afraid of being hungry,'' said Yang Zhaohui, an
activist at nearby Beijing Normal College. ``We'll strike to the
end.''
   Hundreds of students gathered at the campus center late into the
night to listen to colleagues pledge support for the hunger strike.
   Students have marched from their schools to Tiananmen Square
seven times since protests for freedom and democracy broke out a
month ago.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu said he hopes students will not
disrupt the Gorbachev summit.
   ``I'm sure that the overwhelming majority of the students will
proceed from the standpoint of maintaining the political and social
stability in China and act to protect the international prestige of
China,'' Yuan said.
   Students at Beijing University by Thursday night gathered 1,200
signatures for an open invitation to Gorbachev to speak at China's
most prestigious university.
   Yuan said if the students do march, ``I think that the correct
policies and approaches adopted by the Chinese government recently
will be continued to be pursued.''
   Yuan said the government is discussing a proposed law on public
protests.
   Yuan said details of the law have yet to be worked out, but
``that law will be designed to both protect the exercise of civil
rights of citizens and at the same time protect social and state
interests.''
   The government has acted with restraint after threatening a
crackdown and mobilizing troops early in the campaign. There has
been no serious attempt to stop the demonstrations and the
government has agreed to meet selected students to discuss such
issues as freedom of the press and official corruption.
   Activists, however, accuse the government of stalling in
responding to their demands that new independently elected student
groups be recognized and be given a voice in the dialogue.
   In a front-page editorial, the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the
Communist Party, also appealed Friday for calm and stability but
acknowledged complaints by students are real.
   ``More and more people have realized that there are problems
existing in our country, including the problems raised by students.
These problems can only be solved under circumstances of stability
and on the track of democracy and law,'' it said.
   Also Friday, a newspaper said Politburo member Hu Qili met with
reporters from the China Youth News, many of whom have been active
in a journalists' movement for freedom of the press.
   The China Youth News reported that Hu, responsible for
supervising China's state-run media, talked with the journalists
Thursday in ``a cordial, harmonious and friendly atmosphere.''
   It said Hu listened to their opinions, but it gave no details
about his reply.
   Earlier this week, Chinese journalists gave the government a
petition signed by more than 1,000 reporters requesting a dialogue
on censorship.

   The NATO allies today welcomed in
guarded terms Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan to
unilaterally cut 500 short-range nuclear weapons and called on
Moscow not to stop there.
   ``We consider reduction in 500 weapons alone as a welcome,
positive, but rather modest step,'' NATO said in a statement after
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III discussed his trip to
Moscow this week with senior officials of the 15 other NATO nations.
   NATO already has removed 2,400 nuclear arms in the past decade,
the statement said.
   ``Our levels are much lower than those of the Soviet Union,'' it
said and added that NATO looks to Moscow to make further
``reductions in its unwarranted superiority.''
   NATO estimates the Soviet Union has 1,450 short-range nuclear
missile launchers in Europe, against 88 for the Western alliance.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, traveling with
President Bush to Texas, took a harder approach to Gorbachev's
plan. He told reporters he thought it ``is designed principally to
create problems within the alliance ... divisions within the
Western alliance.''
   Baker discussed with the allies a new challenge by Gorbachev to
cut not only short-range nuclear weapons but tanks, troops and
aircraft in Europe as well.
   The NATO meeting was attended by seven foreign ministers,
including Baker and West Germany's Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and
senior officials of the 16 NATO nations.
   The Soviet offer to cut 500 short-range nuclear weapons comes at
a time when NATO is buffeted by an internal dispute over whether to
modernize its 88 Lance missiles. The issue is expected to dominate
a May 29-30 NATO summit here.
   Baker met separately here with Genscher, who wants NATO to delay
the modernization of the Lance missiles until the early 1990s and
begin talks on reducing short-range nuclear arms with the Soviet
Union.
   At the outset of their session at NATO headquarters, a reporter
asked Baker if he planned to ``bury the hatchet'' with Genscher.
``There is no hatchet,'' replied Baker.
   Baker was also met separately with Dutch Foreign Minister Hans
van den Broek whose country is one of several NATO members trying
to mediate in the modernization debate that has pitted Britain and
the United States against West Germany and several other allies.
   The secretary of state at a news conference acknowledged he was
unable to persuade West Germany to back off its demands for U.S.
negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce nuclear missiles in
Europe. After meeting with Genscher, Baker said he still was
hopeful for a settlement before the meeting later this month.
   ``It has not, as yet, been resolved,'' Baker said.
   Many of the 16 allies are lined up with West Germany, while the
United States has the strong support of Britain and a handful of
others. The Germans also are balking at U.S.efforts to more than
triple the range of the short-range U.S. Lance nuclear missiles,
most of which are based on German soil.
   ``It is a very, very important issue, involving as it does
questions of alliance security,'' Baker said.
   After a ``full exchange'' on the issue, Baker said he hoped
Genscher ``better understands our position.''
   On another sensitive issue, there was apparent NATO unity as
Baker briefed seven foreign ministers and other Western officials
on his talks with Gorbachev. The secretary of state said the Soviet
proposal to withdraw 500 battlefield nuclear weapons was
``apparently designed for public opinion'' and had not guaranteed
the weapons would be destroyed.
   Baker told Gorbachev at their meeting in the Kremlin this week
he opposes talks on short-range nuclear weapons saying the Warsaw
Pact was so far ahead in tactical nuclear weapons the United States
could not even consider negotiations until there was ``a little
less of an imbalance.''
   The unilateral cuts Gorbachev intends to make this year include
284 short-range missiles, 166 nuclear bombs carried by airplanes
and 50 nuclear artillery shells.
   In Moscow, Gorbachev also moved boldly on the conventional
weapons front telling Baker he would offer to cut Warsaw Pact tanks
by 40,000, combat aircraft by 42,000, and artillery pieces by
47,000, a U.S. official said.
   Other elements of the plan include a reduction of 1 million
troops in both alliances and a 55 percent reduction in NATO's
combat aircraft.
   By 1997, the official said, Gorbachev is aiming for equal levels
of 1.35 million troops in the two alliances 1,500 strike aircraft
and 20,000 tanks.
   The ceilings in other areas would be 1,700 helicopters, 24,000
artillery pieces and 28,000 combat vehicles.
   Baker declined to evaluate the proposal But the U.S. official
said he had told Gorbachev that it would be up to the NATO alliance
to reply.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Moves to Seize Initiative While NATO Squabbles</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With NATO trying to settle a sharp internal
dispute and his trip to West Germany a month away, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is trying to seize the initiative in Europe by offering a
unilateral cut in tactical nuclear weapons.
   The Soviet president made his move as the Bush administration
emerged from a 3{-month foreign policy review that has delayed
superpower arms talks.
   U.S. officials said Gorbachev's plan to cut 500 warheads this
year was not surprising and insufficient to make up for an
overwhelming Warsaw Pact superiority in tactical weapons. And they
said his plans to cut conventional weapons and forces follow some
North Atlantic Treaty Organization proposals.
   But the timing and the content of his proposal was plainly cast
to put Gorbachev, already popular in Europe, in the role of an
initiator of new ideas in what he calls ``our common European
home'' as NATO squabbles over its policies.
   On Friday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with NATO
allies seeking to smooth differences over plans to modernize its
tactical missiles.
   Such modernization ``is a matter of special concern not only for
the Soviet Union, not only for Eastern Europe, but also for Europe
as a whole, for it applies to a huge part of Europe and justifiably
concerns the public, all Europeans,'' Gorbachev told Baker in talks
Thursday. ``Modernization calls in question the U.S. intentions.''
   A senior U.S. official said, ``This is an emotional political
issue in the West. They know that, and in part they are playing on
that. It's an issue in Germany and Gorbachev is going to Germany
next month.''
   Gorbachev's move followed a series of arms control proposals he
put forward in the last two years that made him appear more dynamic
than President Ronald Reagan. In London last month, Gorbachev tried
to keep that momentum by announcing Soviet cuts in the production
of radioactive materials for nuclear weapons.
   But Western officials said the Soviets already had a sufficient
stockpile of weapons-grade uranium.
   The unilateral cut of 284 short-range missiles, 166 nuclear
bombs and 50 nuclear artillery shells was announced only after
Baker had held a news conference and left Moscow without referring
to it.
   But the U.S. official in Moscow, who spoke on condition he not
further be identified, bristled at a suggestion the United States
had been caught off guard by Gorbachev's proposal and did not know
how to react.
   ``We were quite aware we could expect further unilateral
moves,'' he said.
   He said officials did not know whether the offer would occur
Baker's visit or during Gorbachev's trip to West Germany June 12-15.
   Most of the NATO force of Lance missiles is located in West
Germany, making it the linchpin in the dispute over tactical
weapons. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called for immediate
negotiations on tactical weapons, which the Bush administration
opposes until the Soviet Union reduces its estimated 12-1
superiority.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze traveled to West Germany
on Friday, the day after the Soviet proposal was made, to prepare
for Gorbachev's trip.
   Tass, in a report on Shevardnadze's visit, praised Kohl's stand
for getting ``a positive response in Europe, as has Bonn's
readiness for talks on reducing this class of armaments.''
   The Soviet news agency said Soviet diplomats view relations with
West Germany ``not only within a bilateral but also within an
all-European context and even in a broader, world context.''
   Most NATO allies have lined up behind Kohl. Britain strongly
supports the United States, and Canada and Norway are said to be
working behind the scenes for a compromise.
   After leaving Moscow, Baker described Gorbachev's offer as a
``good step, but a small step.'' The move affects about 5 percent
of an estimated 10,000 battlefield nuclear weapons.
   Gorbachev called for a ceiling of 1.35 million soldiers for both
the Warsaw Pact and NATO to be met by 1996-97, and for limits on
combat aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles.
   He proposed that both sides' nuclear arsenals in Europe be
eliminated entirely by 1991.
   The United States says nuclear weapons are essential to keeping
the peace in Europe.
   According to Tass, Gorbachev told Baker that such arguments are
``unconvincing'' because the Soviet Union was proposing parallel
reductions in coventional forces, which would elminate the need for
a nuclear response to a Warsaw Pact attack.

   An executive with the Easter Seal Society,
who says he was barred from a commuter flight because of his
battery-powered wheelchair, is suing the airlines involved and
Tampa International Airport.
   Dennis J. Celorie, chief executive officer for the
Sarasota-based Easter Seal Society of Southwest Florida, filed the
$2 million lawsuit Thursday naming Delta Air Lines and its feeder
line ComAir Inc.
   He claims ComAir wouldn't let him board a March 17 flight to
Tallahassee because it was against airline policy to transport
battery-powered wheelchairs. He was on his way to a state Labor
Department advisory committee meeting.
   Celorie, 50, has cerebral palsy and has used a powered
wheelchair since college. Airlines used to worry that battery acid
might spill onto luggage, he said, but new chairs use sealed, gel
batteries designed for air travel and approved by federal
regulators.
   His travel agency told ComAir about the wheelchair when
reservations were made two weeks in advance, he said. But when
Celorie tried to board, an attendant refused to let him on the
19-seater, according to the lawsuit.
   Celorie is seeking more than $1 million in compensatory damages,
saying the incident hurt his sensibilities and left him with
``feelings of powerlessness and exclusion.'' He also wants $1
million in punitive damages and an injunction prohibiting the
airlines from banning passengers with similar wheelchairs.
   Officials at ComAir's headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, said
they were not aware of the suit and could not comment. Delta
spokeswoman Jackie Pate said the carrier did nothing wrong in the
incident.
   Delta owns 20 percent of ComAir, one of a number of commuter
airlines that coordinates schedules with Delta to provide air
service to smaller cities.
   Celorie sued the airport because it leases space and landing
rights to the two airlines. ``I really didn't want to sue,''
Celorie said. ``I just wanted to change the policy.''

<HEAD>Smithsonian Official Objects to Parts of Proposed Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, objected Friday to parts of proposed
legislation concerning the building here of a National Museum of
the American Indian, complaining mainly about a provision involving
consultations on remains.
   ``While we are heartened by many provisions of the proposed
bill, we must register objections to others,'' Adams said in
testimony prepared for a joint hearing of the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs and the Rules Committee.
   ``Primary among these is the requirement that the (Smithsonian)
Board of Regents consult with the board of trustees of the new
museum on the matter of skeletal remains.''
   On Monday, Adams signed a memorandum of understanding with the
Museum of the American Indian in New York City to transfer the
world's largest collection of American Indian artifacts to the
Smithsonian.
   The museum would display objects from the Heye Foundation
collection of more than a million artifacts.
   The Smithsonian already has Indian artifacts, including some
34,000 skeletal specimens, almost all of which were acquired
through archaelogical excavations or salvage operations.
   Approximately 14,500 of the remains are North American Indians,
and some tribes have sought return of these bones for burial. The
museum has said it would return any bones which tribes could
identify as being those of their ancestors but few tribes have made
claims.
   ``The collections at issue are under the purview of an entirely
separate museum,'' Adams said in testimony Friday. ``While
individual trustees may be consulted in a personal capacity, the
requirement for consultation with the board as a body is not
appropriate.''
   Adams also objected to a requirement in the bill that seven
members of the board of trustees of the new museum must be of
native American ancestry.
   ``Our agreement with the Museum of the American Indian, Heye
Foundation, which must be approved by the courts in New York,
includes no comparable requirement, although it clearly
contemplates that American Indians and Alaska natives will be
members of the board,'' he said in prepared remarks.

   The bailiff entered the quiet courtroom, ushered
in the jury, then burst into song.
   ``From bias free of every kind, this trial must be tried,'' sang
the bailiff.
   Singing lawyers rhapsodized and harmonized before a singing
judge in a Chicago courtroom in presentations of Gilbert and
Sullivan's operetta ``Trial by Jury'' on Wednesday and Thursday.
   ``Litigation is just like acting,'' said Scott Cooper, a trial
lawyer who played the judge in the Chicago Bar Association
Orchestra production.
   ``A lot of times we get a song and dance in the courtroom,'' he
added.
   Jim Guthrie, the stage director, said lawyers can be trying as

   ``They're used to being in charge,'' he said. ``They listen,
they take notes very well, and if you make a mistake, they're there
to tell you.''
   The operetta, about a woman who accuses a man of breaking his
promise to marry her, drew a packed courtroom.
   Unlike a regular court session, the spectators were allowed
outbursts of applause. And unlike a regular operetta, the cast
could not tear down the set after the last performance _ under
penalty of law.

   Psychic consultant Karen Herbst has
traded in her crystal ball and tarot cards for a computer and a fax
machine to predict her clients' futures.
   Herbst has created a computer program that she said is superior
to the old ways because it removes the psychic's personal views and
prejudices from the process. The only information required for a
$12 to $50 reading is the subject's time, date and place of birth.
   ``When you go to a psychic or an astrologer, their view of the
situation is filtered by who they are. Starfax is not as biased,''
Herbst said.
   Herbst runs the month-old Starfax service from the basement of
her home. She says she computes 15 to 20 readings a day and uses
her facsimile machine to receive requests and transmit forecasts by
phone line to anyone with a similar machine.
   ``I just wanted some information regarding my girlfriend,'' a
recent fax request by a financial analyst read. ``Her birthday is
December 31, 1960. Can you tell me if she's in the mood for love?''
   ``Sherri is not in the mood for love,'' Herbst advised after
checking with her computer. ``Buy her flowers and be patient until
the first week of May.''

<HEAD>Hungarians Vote to Pull Out of Controversial Danube Dam Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government body voted Friday to pull
out of a controversial Danube River dam project it said is ``a
symbol of Hungary's mismanaged economic development,'' the official
news agency reported.
   The decision came in the form of a proposal by an advisory body
of the Council of Ministers, but it serves as a strong indication
the government and Communist Party leadership will scrap the
project.
   This will delight environmentalists, who have said the Nagymaros
dam scheme will destroy wetlands and their unique wildlife, and
probably will anger Czecholovakia, which already has spent $1.1
billion on a companion project.
   The council of economists, lawyers and other experts rejected
the idea of putting the project to a public vote, as suggested in a
petition signed by 140,000 Hungarians, the MTI news agency said.
   ``The body has stated categorically that no referendum should be
held on the matter,'' it reported. ``In these complex questions of
engineering, economy and international law, responsibility must not
be passed on to Hungary's citizens.''
   The multimillion-dollar project to build dams and power stations
at Nagymaros, 30 miles upstream from Budapest, and at Gabcikovo in
Czechoslovakia was drawn up a decade ago with the intent of
boosting electrical power for both communist nations and making the
Danube more navigable.
   Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth told reporters earlier this week
that the project stood a 50-50 chance of being scrapped because it
has ``become a symbol of a long-outdated economic model.''
   Czechoslovakia's investment in Gabcikovo, 40 miles east of
Bratislava, may never be properly realized as experts say the
projects are too interrelated for the Gabcikovo dam to be fully
effective without construction of the Nagymaros segment.
   MTI said the advisory council ``believes that certain
controversial issues are bound to occur even between friendly or
allied states.''
   But the state agency said it expected no damage to relations
between Budapest and Prague unless ``someone were to abuse the
termination of the project for this purpose.''
   It quoted the government council as saying the project ``was
misguided and badly handled all around.''
   ``Terminating the project would not bring about an adequate
situation either, but this was the only alternative for the
country,'' MTI concluded.
   The agency said there was only one dissenting vote in the
council, but it did not say how many people serve on it.

   ``Welcome to Sesame Street and the world!'' said Big Bird.

<HEAD>Court Allows Marijuana Bust On Burglar Search</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dudley Haines' first mistake, leaving
his door ajar when he went fishing, was spotted by a neighbor who
told police there might be a burglar inside. His second, police
allege, was growing marijuana in his closet.
   A state appeal court ruled Thursday that prosecutors can use
those plants in a drug possession case against Haines. The panel
overruled a lower court.
   ``The closet was sufficiently large to have provided a hiding
place for a possible burglar,'' wrote Winifred Sharp, chief judge
of the 5th District Court of Appeal. ``The fact that the police
discovered cannabis in plain view in a place they were entitled to
search for an intruder was bad luck for Haines, but it does not
invalidate their search and discovery.''
   Haines, 26, a supermarket produce clerk who now again faces a
felony drug charge, went fishing on March 5, 1988.
   Lawrence Moore, Haines' neighbor, noticed the open door at 8
p.m. and, seeing no light on, called police to report a possible
burglary, according to court documents.
   ``I don't think he had anything bad in mind,'' Haines said of
Moore. ``He was just looking out for my interests, in his own way.''
   Police said that when they pulled aside a curtain in the hall,
they discovered a closet containing a plant light and a terrarium
holding six marijuana plants.
   Haines was arrested as soon as he came back from his fishing
trip. He said the plants were for his personal use, not
distribution.
   Authorities said the charge against Haines _ possession of more
than 20 grams of cannabis _ is punishable by as much as five years
in prison, but that since he has no prior convictions a jail
sentence would be unlikely.

<HEAD>Drought Toll 160 in Two Weeks, Reports Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 160 people have died in the
past two weeks from dehydration, diarrhea and other effects of a
deadly drought, newspapers reported Friday.
   Temperatures hovered at 102 on Friday and the Health Ministry
warned that citizens should drink more water and mix it with salt
to fend off dehydration. It also cautioned against drinking unsafe
water, the cause of the diarrhea outbreak.
   The government has given no statistics for drought-related
deaths. But the state-owned Bangladesh Times said 100 people in the
northern drought-hit regions had died of diarrhea in the past two
weeks. It quoted local health officials as recording 3,000 cases of
people seeking treatment for diarrhea.
   The newspaper Banglar Bani said 45 people died from the heat in
the Rajshahi, Rangpur and Nilphamari districts of northwestern
Bangladesh in the past 10 days. It said 15 others died in the
neighboring Bogra, Padma and Dinajpur districts.
   The Bengali-language daily said crops had withered, ponds and
lakes had dried up, and there was not enough groundwater to operate
pumps.
   Other newspapers put the heat wave death toll at 30 for the last
10 days. A privately owned news agency, United News of Bangladesh,
said 20 people died from heat in the last week.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
declined to confirm or deny the death tolls. They said people had
died but they were unable to give numbers because of the remoteness
of the regions.
   The Education Ministry ordered all schools in the 16 of the
country's 64 districts to close until the summer monsoon rains
arrive to ease the three-month drought.
   Earlier this week, temperatures reached 107. The government's
weather office said there appeared to be no chance of rain for at
least a week.
   Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries with a per
capita income of only $160 a year, alternates between devastating
drought and innundating floods, as well as being buffeted by
cyclones and tornadoes.
   Last summer, more than 1,400 died when monsoon-swollen rivers
flooded four-fifths of the nation. Another 1,100 died in cyclones
in November.
   Late last month, President Hussain Muhammad Ershad led
nationwide prayers for rain to ease the current drought for his 110
million countrymen and women. The following day rains came,
accompanied by tornadoes that killed more than 1,100 people and
left 130,000 homeless.
   The current drought threatens to destroy at least 50 percent of
the spring grain crops now in the ground. The government had
counted on the the spring harvest to yield 5.6 million tons of rice
and wheat, about one-fourth of the country's annual needs.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Extradition Order For Reputed Terrorist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP DOPOULOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Friday upheld an
extradition order for a Palestinian wanted by the United States in
the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner.
   Mohammed Rashid had appealed a lower court's decision that
granted a U.S. request for his extradition. Washington considers
the case a test of Greece's willingness to fight terrorism.
   ``The court rejects Mohammed Rashid's appeal by majority of
votes,'' said Nikos Sakelaropoulos, president of the Supreme
Court's five-member criminal division.
   The court gave no reason for its decision.
   The final say on whether Rashid is sent to the United States
must be made by the minister of justice, according to Greek law.
   It is unlikely that a decision will be made before the June 18
general elections, however, and Rashid still has time left to serve
for crimes prosecuted by Greek authorities.
   Even though a final decision is pending, a Justice Department
spokesman said in Washington that the Supreme Court's ruling was
significant.
   ``We think this is the biggest hurdle,'' said David Runkel, an
aide to U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   Thornburgh, who was returning to Washington from Madrid, where
he attended a conference on terrorism, issued a statement praising
the Greek court's decision.
   ``The court's decision sends a strong signal around the world
that outright, senseless murder cannot be excused under the dubious
claim of political motivation,'' Thornburgh said. ``There's nothing
political about blowing up innocent civilians in the sky.''
   Rashid, 39, is wanted in the United States for the Pan Am
bombing over Hawaii in which a Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15
people were injured.
   He was arrested in May 1988 at Athens airport following a tip by
the U.S. Embassy and was sentenced to seven months in prison for
holding a false passport. He was sentenced to another eight months
on March 28 for keeping makeshift knives in his prison cell.
   The Supreme Court's decision on Rashid's appeal had been
postponed for months on grounds that U.S. authorities had not
provided enough documents to the Greek court.
   But U.S. diplomats said they provided the Supreme Court with all
the necessary authentic documents.
   Rashid's lawyers had argued that their client is actually
Mohammed Hamdan, 34, a Palestine Liberation Organization military
officer not involved in the terrorist acts for which Rashid is
wanted.
   Spyros Fytrakis, one of two defense lawyers, claimed that
sending Rashid to stand trial in the United States would ``upset
Greece's foreign policy and the country's good relations with the
Arab world. Its obvious the Americans have political reasons to
demand his extradition.''
   The Supreme Court convened under heavy security with dozens of
policemen ringing the building in the city center and sharpshooters
stationed on nearby roofs. Judges arrived escorted by police guards.
   On April 10, the urban terrorist Marxist group May 1 detonated a
bomb outside the apartment of a Supreme Court judge and threatened
to take action against other judges involved in the Rashid case.
   May 1 has claimed responsibility for the assassination of
Supreme Court prosecutor Anastasios Vernardos in January. Another
terrorist group, November 17, also claimed the shooting death of a
magistrate and the wounding of another.

   Two Soviet monitoring teams planned to arrive
in San Francisco for short-notice inspections under the
intermediate-range nuclear treaty, U.S. officials announced Friday.
   The teams, each consisting of about 10 Soviets, were scheduled
to arrive at Travis Air Force Base, and are to inform U.S.
authorities on Saturday which of five sites they intend to inspect,
said Lt. Col. Joe Wagovich, a spokesman for the On-Site Inspection
Agency.
   Possible sites they might visit are Pueblo Depot Activity,
Pueblo, Colo.; Dugway Proving Grounds, Dugway, Utah; Davis-Monthan
Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.; Fort Huachuca, Sierra Vista, Ariz.;
and Air Force Plant 19, San Diego.
   Also aboard the Soviet aircraft was a team to replace the
permanent group stationed at Magna, Utah, to monitor Hercules Plant
No. 1, formerly associated with the production of Pershing-2
missiles, one of the American weapons being destroyed under the
treaty.
   Under the treaty, which requires the superpowers to destroy all
nuclear missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles, each side can
make 20 short-notice inspections of sites associated with the
weapons during a 12-month period.
   With the completion of the current inspections, the Soviets will
have made 19 such visits, one short of their limit during the
12-month period that ends this month, said the spokesman.

   Thirty-three customs officers at Taiwan's
Chiang Kai-shek International airport were indicted for taking
$500,000 in bribes to expedite imports of fish, fruits and other
goods, a district court reported Friday.
   Eight customs brokers and three businessmen also were charged
with offering bribes, according to the Taoyuan District Court.
   The customs officers were arrested in March following reports of
corruption that dated back to 1985.
   About one-quarter of the airport's 410 customs officers went on
a three-day strike last month to protest extra work resulting from
a staff shortage after the arrests.
   If convicted, they face up to seven years in prison.

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will have a
close encounter with the U.S. Navy next week when he makes his
historic visit to China's largest city.
   But Soviet authorities said Friday they were not worried that
Gorbachev is to visit Shanghai on the same day U.S. warships are to
pay a port call.
   ``I don't think we should overestimate the importance'' of the
port call, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said.
   At least two warships from the U.S. 7th Fleet will sail into
Shanghai on Thursday, when Gorbachev will be touring the city on
his final day in China.
   It is only the second port call by Navy vessels to communist
China. The first was in 1986 to the Yellow Sea port of Qingdao.
   Foreign diplomats see the port call as a clear signal by the
Chinese that better relations with the Soviet Union won't interfere
with China's strong ties with the United States.
   China has stressed that Gorbachev's visit, and normalization of
long-strained relations with the Soviet Union, won't affect its
relations with other countries.
   Gorbachev arrives Monday for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30
years.
   Yevgeny M. Primakov, director of the Institute of World Economic
and International Relations of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, also
denied any relation between the port call and the Gorbachev visit.
   ``There has been no request either from the Soviet leader or
from Chinese leaders to visit the ships at that time,'' he said.
   Primakov and other Soviet speakers at a news conference
emphasized the importance of Sino-Soviet rapprochement.
   ``This is not just another visit in the framework of times, but
of historic necessity,'' Primakov said.
   ``We are two socialist states faced with major challenges. Our
rapprochement will in one way or another make it easier to clarify
our difficulties.''

   Combat troops moved out today bound for Pamama
from U.S. air bases, part of President Bush's order to protect
American lives as the United States mobilizes diplomatic pressure
to force the ouster of military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The first wave of Marine reinforcements from Camp Lejeune, N.C.,
and Army troops from the 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord,
Calif., flew to Panama as part of the Defense Department's
operation, dubbed ``Nimrod Dancer.''
   Bush, reacting to post-election violence, announced the
deployment Thursday of 2,000 combat troops to Panama to augment the
10,000 American service personnel stationed there.
   The president also said he was ready to explore ways to entice
Noriega to step down on his own.
   Diplomatic moves included a meeting today in Washington of the
Organization of American States, where members of the permanent
council unanimously approved a Venezuelan resolution calling for a
special meeting Wednesday to discuss the Panama crisis.
   ``I will do what is necessary to protect the lives of American
citizens and we will not be intimidated by the bullying tactics,
brutal though they may be, of the dictator, Noriega,'' Bush said.
   At the same time, Bush's national security adviser questioned
both the likelihood of a real confrontation with Noriega and the
efficacy of the president's action in forcing Panama's de facto
ruler from power.
   ``He is a thug but he clearly operates with some prudence when
he has to,'' said Brent Scowcroft, the president's national
security adviser. He called the troop buildup ``precautionary as
much as anything else,'' although Bush had said in his news
conference, ``I'm worried about the lives of American citizens.''
   Scowcroft all but acknowledged that Bush's action would do
little to force Noriega from power.
   ``We can always hope he will see the error of his ways and we
are looking at ways to help convince him to recognize the will of
the Panamanian people,'' Scowcroft said.
   Asked if it would be acceptable for Noriega to still be in power
a month from now, Scowcroft said, ``I don't see why not.''
   The deployment of two Army battalions, one Marine company and
dozens of armored personnel carriers began late Thursday, and the
Pentagon said it likely will take a week or more to complete.
   For 15 months, the United States has been frustrated in its
efforts to force Noriega from power following his indictment in
Florida on drug-trafficking charges.
   The latest steps, containing no new economic sanctions or orders
for direct military action, drew bipartisan praise in a joint
statement from congressional leaders as ``measured and deliberate
steps to assist the Panamanian people in restoring democracy to
Panama.''
   However, some lawmakers grumbled Bush did not go far enough and
said tougher action was needed to drive out Noriega.
   A number of lawmakers had urged Bush ``to invade Panama or to
break the treaty with Panama'' which commits the United States to
turn over control of the Panama Canal at the end of the century,
said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the Senate's deputy Democratic
leader. Cranston was among those to support Bush.
   Unlike former President Reagan, Bush said he would not consider
dropping the drug charges to get Noriega to go.
   ``But look, I will be open-minded about seeing what it might
take to see him leave,'' Bush said in a brief news conference.
   Short of dropping the drug indictment, Bush said, ``the door is
open to understand what it is that would be required.''
   The president made a direct appeal to Latin America in general _
and Panamanians in particular _ to move against Noriega in the wake
of Sunday's presidential election, which was widely denounced as
fraudulent and was followed by violence.
   ``We would encourage countries in this hemisphere to either
jointly or personally make strong statements,'' Bush said as he
announced the U.S. troop buildup.
   ``The United States strongly supports and will cooperate with
initiatives taken by governments in this hemisphere to address this
crisis through regional diplomacy and action'' in the OAS and
elsewhere, Bush said.
   ``The crisis in Panama is a conflict between Noriega and the
people of Panama,'' Bush said. ``The United States stands with the
Panamanian people.''
   Bush announced he was recalling the U.S. ambassador to Panama,
Arthur Davis, and reducing the embassy staff to essential
personnel. A State Department official said today about half of the
93 embassy staff have been instructed to leave with their families.
   The State Department issued a travel advisory Thursday for
Panama, warning Americans against travel there.
   Bush said U.S. government employees and their dependents living
outside of military bases would be returned to the United States or
relocated for safety reasons from Panama City and other locations
to U.S. bases in Panama.
   Altogether, there are roughly 51,300 American in Panama. Aside
from military and diplomatic personnel and their dependents, there
are about 21,300 businessmen and U.S. retirees.

   Delegates of the World Health Organization today
voted against a measure that would have granted immediate
membership in WHO to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In a secret ballot, the WHO annual assembly voted 80-49 against
the Nicaraguan proposal. There were 19 abstentions.
   Another proposal to defer the question of PLO admission until
next year has yet to be voted on. WHO's chief urged delegates to
support that measure, saying to do otherwise would jeopardize WHO's
future.
   The United States has threatened to withdraw funding for WHO if
the Palestinian state declared in November is allowed to become the
organization's 167th member state.
   In Paris, a PLO spokesman said the Palestinian group is prepared
to finance WHO's Africa operations if the United States carries
through on its threat.
   A compromise proposal by nine Western and Third World countries
calls for deferring the PLO application until next year while
calling for more aid to go to residents of the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   WHO Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima, who has urged PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat to put off his application, called on the
assembly ``not to jeopardize the future of our organization'' and
to agree to the compromise.
   ``That future is in your hands,'' he told the more than 1,000
delegates.
   Nicaragua then submitted what it termed ``amendments'' to the
compromise proposal. Those amendments were tantamount to an Arab
draft resolution calling on the assembly to admit the state of
Palestine immediately. They failed in the secret ballot.
   The PLO's parliament-in-exile, the Palestine National Council,
declared the independent state in November. The PLO, which has
non-voting status in the U.N. system, is attempting to join all of
the major U.N. agencies as a full member.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said admitting the PLO
would harm the Middle East peace process and the entire U.N.
system. The United States and its Western allies say the nation
proclaimed by the PLO does not fulfill internationally accepted
criteria of statehood, including control of a defined territory and
a capital.
   The United States has contributed $94 million to WHO's regular
budget and special programs to fight specific diseases.
   WHO plays a vital role in assisting governments worldwide to
strengthen their health services and advance work to eradicate
diseases, such as AIDS, and to promote health care and nutrition.
   In an apparent bid to woo Third World countries to the PLO's
side, PLO spokesman Omar Massalha said in Paris the organization
would take over funding of African programs in the event of a U.S.
withdrawal of aid.
   ``The PLO has already put together necessary funding for
financing the programs and activities of the WHO in Africa in the
event that the United States should suspend its financial
contribution following the admission of the state of Palestine as a
member state of WHO,'' Massalha said.
   Massalha said the money had been raised from several Arab and
non-aligned countries.

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers' compensation benefits awarded
to a flight attendent who broke a leg while skiing during a layover
in Oregon have been reversed by a state appeals court.
   The 1st District Court of Appeals previously has allowed
benefits for injuries sustained off duty while on
employment-related trips, but it ruled the skiing trip didn't count.
   ``We cannot conclude in the instant case that a 58-mile day-trip
to pursue one's love of skiing is either a minimal deviation or a
reasonable and foreseeable activity, especially in light of the
nature of the sport of skiing which involves a great amount of
risk,'' District Judge J. Klein Wigginton wrote in the Wednesday
opinion.
   A three-judge panel unanimously reversed benefits that had been
awarded to Eastern Airlines flight attendant Chandler Rigdon by a
state deputy commissioner of workers' compensation. The award was
appealed by Eastern and North River Insurance Co.
   Wigginton wrote that the skiing accident differed from an injury
suffered by another Eastern employee in a basketball game played at
a YMCA gym for which benefits were allowed by the court in a 1985
case.
   He noted guests at the hotel where the employee was staying had
gym visitation rights and ``the game constituted sports activity
reasonably necessary for personal health and recreation'' just like
swimming in the hotel pool.
   In a 1986 case, the appeal court also allowed benefits for a Pan
Am employee injured when a matchbook went up in flames as she was
lighting a cigarette, ruling that smoking is related to ``personal
comfort.''
   ``We cannot conceive of a rule that would include downhill
skiing in a list of such personal activities as drinking,
breathing, eating or even smoking,'' Wigginton wrote.
   The court also has allowed compensation for off-duty injuries in
activities that increase productivity as in the case of a lawn
maintenance employee who was hurt when he took a dip in a river
during a break.

   Qantas Airways said Friday it lost
track of a body bound for burial in Fiji that instead went around
the South Pacific with a cargo of vegetables.
   The airline said the family of Jag Mohan Singh, an immigrant who
died in April, had arranged to ship home his body for a funeral.
   But the airline said it inadvertently flew the body to Tahiti
and Los Angeles then back to Australia over three days before
discovering the error.
   The body finally was delivered to the family 36 hours after the
scheduled funeral. More than 1,500 people turned up for the funeral
in Suva only to be told the body had not arrived.
   The coffin was placed aboard a Qantas flight April 13 but was
stacked beneath cartons of vegetables, and airport workers at Nadi,
Fiji, were unable to find it.
   ``They treated my father like a sack of vegetables,'' said
Hamendra Singh, the dead man's son.

   A woman who claimed her two young
daughters were abducted by masked gunmen in similar circumstances
three years apart was charged today with concealing a homicide and
obstruction of justice in the death of the first child.
   The charges against Paula Sims, 29, were filed 13 days after she
reported that her second daughter, 6-week-old Heather Lee, had been
abducted by a masked gunman. Heather was found dead May 3.
   Jersey County State's Attorney Richard J. Ringhausen signed a
criminal complaint alleging one count of concealing a homicide and
three counts of obstructing justice in the 1986 death of 13-day-old
Loralei Sims, said Linda Long, chief deputy court clerk.
   An arrest warrant was issued and Mrs. Sims was expected to
surrender today. Jersey County Circuit Judge Claude Davis set bond
at $100,000, Ms. Long said.
   Mrs. Sims and her husband, Robert, of Alton, have denied any
wrongdoing through their attorney, Donald Groshong.
   Police say Sims told them he believes Mrs. Sims may have killed
their daughters accidentally.
   The Simses told police Heather Lee was abducted by a masked
gunman April 29. Heather's body was recovered in a trash barrel on
the Missouri side of the Mississippi River four days later. An
autopsy showed the infant had been smothered by someone putting a
hand over her mouth. Tests also indicated that the body had been
frozen before it was placed in the trash can.
   On June, 17, 1986, the Simses gave police a nearly identical
account in the disappearance of their firstborn daughter, Loralei.
   The decomposed remains of a baby, believed to be Loralei, were
found several days later near the couple's home in Brighton, where
they were living at the time. Brighton is about 10 miles from Alton.
   The Simses refused to answer questions before the grand jury
that investigated Loralei's death and the panel took no action.
   The family buried Heather on Wednesday next to the unmarked
grave containing remains believed to be Loralei's.

   West Berliners on Friday paid their respects to
the U.S. and British pilots who were killed during the Allied
airlift that sustained the city during an 11-month Soviet blockade
40 years ago.
   The Soviets lifted the blockade on May 12, 1949, after failing
in their quest to bring the Western sector under their control.
   The Berlin Airlift was ordered by American military governor
Lucius D. Clay on June 24, 1948, _ the same day the Soviets imposed
their blockade.
   The Allies flew 1.8 million tons of food and fuel to the Western
enclave surrounded by Communist territory, making more than 277,000
flights.
   To mark the 40th anniversary of the end of the blockade, West
Berliners joined politicians in honoring those who died in the
Allied effort.
   Dozens of wreaths were placed at the Airlift Memorial at
Tempelhof airport. The memorial was built in honor of the 39
British and 31 American airmen and eight German ground personnel
who died in plane crashes during the airlift.
   The U.S. ambassador to West Germany, Vernon A. Walters, renewed
his country's pledge to guarantee the freedom of West Berlin.
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper expressed the gratitude of the
city's resident to the Allies. He said the airlift turned the
occupation powers into ``protectors and partners of the city.''
   Another ceremony was held at the Reuter power plant. The Allies
flew most of the parts needed to build the plant after the Soviets
cut off power supplies.

<TEXT>
   The vital importance of U.S.-Japan defense
ties is a key reason why Congress should approve the $7 billion FSX
warplane deal, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee said Friday.
   ``It is important that we stay together with Japan, that we
maintain that cooperation and alliance,'' said Sen. Richard G.
Lugar, R-Ind., as the Senate headed into a second day of floor
debate over the controversial deal.
   He sought to rebut arguments by opponents that the proposal to
jointly develop and produce a next-generation fighter for Japan
would jeopardize American jobs and technological prowess.
   Lugar said U.S. industry would gain the same amount of business
_ about $2.5 billion _ with the FSX as it would by selling wholly
American-made F-16 fighters to Japan, as critics of the FSX have
urged.
   ``We're not losing business by failing to sell the F-16s off the
shelf,'' he said.
   Lugar contended that if the United States pulls out of the FSX
deal, this most likely would drive Japan into a concerted effort to
develop and produce the fighter on its own _ thus tending to
undercut future U.S.-Japanese cooperation on defense.
   ``I think that is a potentially dangerous course for Japan and
for the United States,'' he said.
   Under the FSX deal, General Dynamics and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries would jointly develop and produce the FSX, an advanced
version of the American F-16, for deployment by Japan in the late
1990s. General Dynamics has headquarters in St. Louis, but most of
the FSX work would be done at its F-16 plant in Fort Worth, Texas.
   On Thursday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted by 9-8
to approve the agreement.
   A vote by the full Senate is expected early next week on a
resolution aimed at halting the fighter deal. A companion
resolution of disapproval has been introduced in the House.
   Even if the resolutions were passed, however, a two-thirds
majority of both houses would be needed to override a likely
presidential veto.
   Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., a leading opponent of the FSX,
called the proposal ``a rotten deal.''
   On the issue of U.S.-Japan defense ties, Dixon said that ``until
recently our military relationship with Japan has overshadowed our
economic relationship, but this cannot continue.''
   The Illinois Democrat argued that American technology to be
provided to Japan under the FSX deal will be exploited by the
Japanese to significantly advance their own aircraft industry.
   ``We will be helping our fiercest economic competitor build a
top-notch aerospace industry,'' he said, adding that Japan's future
push into this area may be comparable to the ``Japanese invasion''
of the U.S. automobile market over the past decade.
   Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., said the FSX deal points to the need
for this country to take steps to force Japan to open its markets
and thus help reduce the $55 billion trade deficit.
   He said the United States should tell Japan that ``you indeed
need to change, you need to open up _ you can't have it all.''

   A speeding freight train jumped
its tracks and smashed into a row of houses today, killing at least
three people and injuring at least 10, city officials and witnesses
said.
   The dead were believed to be the train's engineer and two boys
whose home was hit by the train, said mayor's spokesman Gregory
Garcia. At least one person was missing and rescuers searched the
wreckage for others.
   The 69-car Southern Pacific freight, which witnesses said was
traveling at high speed off the grade from the Cajon Pass, derailed
at 7:41 a.m. It toppled off an embankment and into a neighborhood
of modest two- and three-bedroom homes on the outskirts of the
city. It was not immediately known how fast the train was traveling.
   ``The engine came off the track and went through a house,'' said
Dane Maloney, who saw the crash on his way to work.
   ``It was terrible, there were train cars on top of houses, train
cars on top of cars. It sounded like a couple of bombs going off.''
   Reports of the number of cars and houses involved varied as
authorities tried to help the injured and assess the damage
inflicted by the train, flying dirt and rocks from the roadbed.
   Garcia said 55 cars left the tracks, and that none of them were
carrying toxic material. The train carried potash, a compound used
to make fertilizer and soap. It had the consistency of sand.
   Twelve homes were damaged and two of them were destroyed, Garcia
said. Four of the homes were buried under freight cars.
   ``It was going down from Cajon real fast, didn't have no brakes.
I looked over, part of the train was in the air. It just fell back
on the ground and all the sand started flying up in the air and
stuff,'' said Kelly Michaels, a little boy who saw the wreck.
   In addition to the three confirmed dead, at least 10 people were
injured, Garcia said, adding that most of the injuries were minor.
   Four adults and one child with only minor bruises, abrasions and
lacerations apparent were treated at San Bernardino Community
Hospital, said Dr. Frank Letson. ``Their homes were involved,'' he
said.
   A train engineer and one resident were in fair condition at St.
Bernardine's Medical Center. They had cuts and abrasions and were
being X-rayed for other possible injuries, said spokeswoman Tony
Callicott.
   The resident ``was a homeowner whose home collapsed. He was not
in it, fortunately,'' Ms. Callicott said.
   The train was carrying potash from the high-desert town of
Mojave to Long Beach, said Southern Pacific spokesman Jerry Pera.
He said he was unable to confirm some witnesses' reports that the
train was traveling at high speed. The cause of the crash wasn't
immediately known.
   Tracks were expected to remain closed at least a day, forcing
detour of 15 freights and two passenger trains a day, Pera said.
   Radio reporter Don Booth said he saw several victims, apparently
dead, and several others injured.
   ``It's just splintered rubble everywhere,'' said Booth, of
station KRSO in San Bernardino. ``The police are pulling bodies
from the wreckage. Cars are scattered all over the neighborhood.
The locomotive is buried in sand.''
   Booth counted seven houses destroyed, and said sand and gravel
were strewn throughout the neighborhood. Scores of residents milled
around the demolished homes, watching rescuers search for their
friends and neighbors.
   Southern Pacific spokesman Jim Loveland confirmed ``a major
derailment'' but couldn't immediately provide details on the
accident.
   The accident site is about 60 miles east of Los Angeles near the
foothills south of 4,190-foot Cajon Pass, the major road and rail
conduit from the Los Angeles basin to Las Vegas.

<HEAD>Recession-Free Forecast Carries Worries About Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top business leaders said
Friday they see little likelihood of a recession over the next two
years but forecast a sharp slowdown in economic growth and little
progress on taming inflation.
   The Business Council, composed of 65 executives from America's
largest corporations, said the economy already has begun to lose
steam and that further slackening carries with it ``some risk of
recession.''
   ``Any time a growth slowdown occurs, there's always some risk
that it will soften into a recession, but the group does not see
that likely either this year or next,'' said Walter V. Shipley,
chairman of Chemical Banking Corp.
   The council's consensus forecast projects that economic growth,
as measured by the gross national product, will slow from a healthy
3.9 percent pace in 1988 to 1.4 percent by the end this year and
will average 1.7 percent in 1990.
   The panel's economists actually forecast a rebound in activity
by late next year, with growth rising to a 3.1 percent pace by the
fourth quarter of 1990.
   ``That hints at the possibility that after a period of rest and
renewal, the American economy in 1991 will be headed toward an
unprecedented ninth year of peacetime cyclical expansion,'' Shipley
said.
   The panel's forecast was more pessimistic about prospects for
reducing inflation, which ran at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the
first quarter of 1989, up from 4.4 percent in the last two years.
   ``The central view is that although the flare-up in prices early
in 1989 was an aberration, price behavior will not improve
appreciably until mid-1990,'' the report said.
   The group projected inflation will average 5 percent for the
next two years, with some of the corporate economists who worked on
the report anticipating it may exceed 6 percent.
   The Bush administration, which projects GNP growth of 3.2
percent this year, is basing its optimistic economic assumptions in
part on an expectation that inflation will be about 3.6 percent
this year and fall to 3.5 percent in 1990.
   Richard Breeden, a top adviser to President Bush, told the
business executives that the administration regards the recent
slowing of economic activity ``as a pause and a base for further
expansion.''
   ``In some ways it takes some pressure off monetary policy and
the concerns about whether the economy was overheating,'' Breeden
said after a private meeting with the executives, gathered for a
two-day retreat at a posh Virginia resort.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus
contain inflation.
   The slowing of the economy in response to the Fed's action, even
as inflation remains strong, has a growing number of analysts
worried that the Fed may inadvertently push the country into a
recession.
   A separate survey of 50 leading economists by the Blue Chip
Economic Indicators newsletter found more than two-thirds expect a
recession to start either this year or next.
   But the Business Council found three reasons to doubt a
recession lies ahead: a belief that the economy is free of
fundamental imbalances; an expectation that the Fed is unlikely to
nudge interest rates higher, and the likelihood that strong
economies in Europe and Japan will fuel demand for U.S. exports.
   Nevertheless, the council forecast slower progress on narrowing
the nation's trade deficit over the next two years. The trade gap
is projected at $100 billion in 1990, down from $119.76 billion
last year and $152 billion in 1987.
   The economic slowdown should help narrow the trade gap somewhat
by reducing import demand even as imports are rising, the council
said. In addition, an expectation that the dollar will decline in
value should make U.S. products more competitive overseas, it said.
   Shipley said the council's forecast for slower economic growth,
while it could help ease inflationary pressures, carries with it
the risk of higher unemployment, mediocre corporate profits,
sluggish gains in personal income and disappointing revenues for
the federal Treasury.
   The group is projecting a $135 billion budget deficit for fiscal
1990, $35 billion above the limit established under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   Congress, after protracted negotiations with the Bush
administration, has drafted a budget that would hold the deficit to
just under the $100 billion Gramm-Rudman limit, but the business
leaders remained concerned about the failure to make faster
progress on reducing the deficit.

<HEAD>Soviet Citizens Getting First Visa Banking Cards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union moved the ruble into the
electronic age this week as the nation's largest bank began issuing
Visa cards to replace the passbook savings account, Visa
International reported Friday.
   ``This is a giant step forward,'' said Charles T. Russell,
president of Visa International, which is licensing Sberbank in
Moscow to use the Visa name. Visa International, with nearly 200
million cardholders worldwide, is owned and operated by 21,000
banks.
   Russell said the move is the Soviet Union's first step toward
automating its national banking system, with the aim for this year
of extending the card to more than 40,000 customers and to five
million within three years.
   Sberbank, the nation's only retail bank, said it had begun
issuing cards to a select group of 2,000 customers who will be able
to use them to withdraw up to 250 rubles a week from automated
teller machines, Russell said.
   Foreign Visa cards have been accepted in the Soviet Union since
1974 through an arrangement with Intourist, which acted as an agent
of the Bank of America's Visa card operation. Last year, Intourist
itself became a Visa member, issuing its own internationally valid
payment cards.
   The Sperbank Visa card is to replace the traditional saviongs
account passbook, serving as a debit card enabling the holder to
get to funds on deposit.
   Visa International spokesman David Brancoli said at VI
headquarters in San Mateo that in the next six months service
additions will include use of the card to make purchases at Moscow
department stores and restaurants, with a few selected shops
equipped with electronic point-of-sale terminals.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of American military
dependents evacuated their homes in Panama, and a U.S. military
source said today that some Panamanians had joined them in taking
refuge at U.S. military installations.
   The first contingent of U.S. troops today headed for the Central
American nation under orders of President Bush, who stepped up his
offensive against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega by ordering in 2,000
soldiers.
   Fifty soldiers took off shortly after dawn from Travis Air Force
Base in California.
   Bush on Thursday also recalled U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis to
protest the annulling of Sunday's election and the beating of the
opposition presidential and vice presidential candidates by
supporters of Noriega.
   Armed forces television announced there was no school today for
the children of Americans in Panama. It also reminded guards at the
gates of military military installations to check identifications.
   A State Department official in Washington said today about half
the 93 embassy staff members had been instructed to leave Panama
with their families. A travel advisory warning Americans not to
travel in Panama was issued late Thursday.
   The crisis convulsing this strategically important country
occurred after the government halted the counting of ballots
Wednesday and claimed its presidential candidate, handpicked by
Noriega, held a 2-1 lead.
   A team of international observers headed by former President
Jimmy Carter said the opposition presidential candidate, Guillermo
Endara, had won by a 3-to-1 measure despite widespread fraud.
   Endara, who was severely beaten Wednesday during a street
protest by a group of thugs wielding two-by-fours and metal pipes,
remained hospitalized today.
   Several hundred U.S. diplomatic and military families on
Thursday packed up emergency supplies of clothing and treasured
keepsakes to seek refuge in one of the 10 American military bases.
   A U.S. military source said today that since Monday night, more
than 160 160 Panamanians, some with families, have been given
refuge at U.S. military installations.
   ``We screen them to make sure they have reasons to seek
refuge,'' the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``They are here because they have shown that they are in
physical danger for political reasons. Some of them eventually may
be granted political asylum. Others probably will return to Panama
if the situation settles,'' said the source.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Terry Kneebone said there were no direct
threats against U.S. personnel but that in the past the Panamanian
government has publicized the neighborhoods where Americans live.
   U.S. government figures put the number of embassy dependents in
Panama at 152. There are about 10,600 military dependents, 972 of
whom live off-base, according to U.S. Southern Command figures.
   In addition, there are another 20,000 American civilians living
in Panama, most of them retirees or in private business.
Representatives of American businesses based in Panama, once a
leading international financial center, were urged to evacuate
their families.
   Opposition vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon,
who was also beaten Wednesday, called the sending in of American
troops ``a U.S. policy provoked by Noriega and not sought by us.''
   Arias issued an ``urgent call to Latin American and North
American and European governments to start a concerted, decisive
diplomatic and political action to help make the will of our people
prevail and to keep us from sinking deeper in to savagery and
disaser.''
   He said this should be done through the the Organization of
American States.
   The Soviet Union denounced the troop deployment. Vadim
Perfiliev, a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters
today the situation in Panama had come to a head and was marked by
overt U.S. interference.
   ``It is a matter for the Panamanian people themselves to clear
up the situation and break the deadlock,'' he said in Moscow. ``Any
outside interference is only exacerbating the already very serious
situation.''
   The 1,881 troops, making up a light division and a standard
mechanized division, will join about 10,000 U.S. forces already
stationed in Panama. Officials said operation ``Nimrod Dancer''
will take about a week to send all the reinforcements.
   Panamanian government television said Thursday the troop
deployment is ``within the framework of the aggressive policy'' of
the United States.
   Rigoberto Perez, former secretary-general of the Revolutionary
Democratic Party, the main pro-government party, said the
government has no plans to get rid of Noriega.
   ``He is our leader. You don't change leaders in time of war,''
Perez said.
   The government said it nullified the results because American
meddling, among other factors, made it impossible to declare a
winner.
   Yolanda Pulice de Rodriguez, at a news conference from which
American news organizations were barred, said there were no plans
for new elections.
   Noriega is under federal indictments in Miami and Tampa, Fla.,
on drug trafficking charges. He has been the de facto leader of
Panama since he took over the military in 1983. He denies the drug
charges.
   Washington imposed sanctions on Panama after Noriega engineered
the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle in February 1988. The
U.S. government continues to recognize Delvalle instead of acting
President Manuel Solis Palma.

   The city ambulance service took 13 minutes _
three more than its goal _ to respond to the home of schools
Chancellor Richard Green as he lay dying of an asthma attack,
officials said Friday.
   Sixty to 90 seconds were consumed by the dispatcher completing
an earlier call, and another 60 to 90 seconds were used when the
dispatcher tried to summon a private ambulance that turned out to
be out of service, they said.
   The private ambulance's operator, Lenox Hill Hospital, had
failed to notify the Emergency Medical Service the ambulance was
not available, said Lynn Schulman, an EMS spokeswoman.
   The city complained to Lenox Hill of that oversight in a letter
Thursday. A Lenox Hill spokeswoman said it would respond sometime
Friday.
   EMS was called to Green's home at 1:41 a.m. Wednesday and sent
an ambulance five minutes later. Schulman said two minutes, ``maybe
three,'' was the norm for dispatch. Still, the overall 13-minute
response time was ``within the range'' of the EMS goal of 10
minutes or less for top-priority calls, she said.
   ``We're not talking about something that took a half-hour or an
hour,'' Schulman said. ``It's not a terrific response time, but
it's not anything that there should be a lot of concern about.''
   She said it was impossible to say whether a faster response
could have saved Green.
   Last week, 57 percent of priority ambulance calls were handled
by the EMS in under 10 minutes, and the average response time was
10 minutes and 23 seconds, about a half-minute over the goal,
Schulman said.

<TEXT>
   Industrialized nations must bear
financial responsibility for saving the environment in developing
nations, according to an EEC-sponsored conference Friday.
   Scientists, historians, philosophers and lawyers from Europe,
Asia and the United States concluded that the wealthy countries
should pay for environmental cleanup and reforestation projects in
the poorer nations.
   ``The responsibility lies with us,'' said Carlos Ripa di Meana,
the European Economic Community's commissioner for the environment.
   ``Developed nations must collaborate with poorer countries,''
said Jiro Kondo, president of the Science Council of Japan. ``In
order to abate pollution you must be rich enough to introduce the
proper equipment.''
   Di Meana said the question of the developing world's $450
billion foreign debt and possible debt-for-nature-swaps should be
considered. Many environmentalists argue for the plan, in which
developing nations agree to preserve forested areas in return for
debt relief.
   ``Developed countries cannot impose on developing countries
without some kind of specific compensation for what we're asking
them to do,'' said Pierre Marc Johnson of McGill University in
Montreal.
   But environmental programs should not stymie economic growth,
said Michael H. Robinson of the Smithsonian Institute in
Washington. Much of the destruction of rain forests is caused by
subsistence-level farmers who cut down trees for firewood or to
plant crops, he said.
   ``Halting the destruction cannot and must not involve freezing
the development of the Third World,'' Robinson said.
   He suggested researchers look for alternatives to cutting trees,
such as developing crops that grow in the forest.

   A fugitive captured at the polo club in
this coastal city cashed in on national concern for Vietnam
veterans by offering $100 ``Forgotten Man'' medallions, authorities
say.
   Michael J. Crosby persuaded 6,000 people, including many
veterans, to buy $100 silver medallions, but only 400 people
received them, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joan Lancaster of
Minneapolis.
   He also misled famed former test pilot Chuck Yeager to get him
to make a videotape promoting a veterans memorial park supposedly
benefited by the medallion sales, prosecutors say.
   Crosby, 42, was arrested Thursday by the FBI at his home at the
Polo Club of Boca Raton. He was ordered held without bail until he
can be returned to Minneapolis, where he faces a prison sentence of
160 years from a November conviction on mail fraud charges.
   ``I think he exploited the feelings of people that Vietnam vets
were not given a fair shake,'' said Lancaster. ``Through
exploitation, he induced people to make an investment they
otherwise would be prevented, through common sense, to make.''
   An FBI agent in San Diego said Crosby is wanted there on charges
of bilking an 88-year-old woman out of $50,000 in bank stocks.
   Crosby's company, ``Vets for Vets,'' used a testimonial from
Yeager to help solicit investors in a plan to build a memorial park
near Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota, Lancaster
said. But Crosby reneged on a $90,000 land contract, and the park
was not built.
   Yeager, the first man to fly faster than sound, testified on
Oct. 19 that he had not signed a contract permitting Crosby to use
the videotape. Yeager said he had hoped to check out Crosby's
company before granting such permission.

<HEAD>De Klerk Calls for Quick and Drastic Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Party leader F.W. de
Klerk, expected to become South Africa's next president, called
Friday for a new political system free from domination by the white
minority or black majority.
   De Klerk said the racially segregated system ``will have to
change drastically and quickly,'' but his speech before Parliament
dealt more with policies he rejects than details of the type of
government he proposes.
   He said the governing party wanted decisions by consensus,
dismissing the continued white rule supported by the Conservative
Party and calling a one-person, one-vote system favored by the
anti-apartheid Democratic Party ``totally unacceptable.''
   ``A mere majority decision would be domination, and failure to
reach consensus should be settled by a fair referee,'' he said
without elaboratation.
   De Klerk, 53, became party leader when the post was vacated by
President P.W. Botha, who suffered a stroke in January. Botha, head
of government since 1978, plans to retire after an election on
Sept. 6, and de Klerk, the education minister, is virtually assured
of succeeding him.
   De Klerk's speech in Cape Town came a day after Constitutional
Development Minister Chris Heunis announced his resignation. Last
week, Heunis attracted wide publicity with a speech suggesting that
blacks be given a role in Parliament, in the Cabinet and in the
selection of a president.
   De Klerk called Heunis' speech ``exploratory,'' and said, ``to
deduce from his speech that the National Party is now following ...
the way to majority rule is untrue.''
   Parliament includes subordinate chambers for Asians and people
of mixed-race, but the 28 million blacks have no formal role of any
sort in national politics.
   ``White security can never be built on injustice towards
others,'' de Klerk said. ``White domination, over the greatest
portion of our country, as the Conservative Party calls for, leads
inescapably to catastrophe. And it will be our children
particularly who will pay the price.
   ``The Conservative Party stands for a minority government in a
South Africa that will, by their own admission, in perpetuity be
populated by a majority of people of color. It is unfair and does
not pass the test of justice,'' de Klerk said.
   ``The Democratic Party stands for a majority government. In a
country with such a massive and wide diversity as ours, this is
unfair to the smaller peoples and population groups. Their policy,
too, fails the test of justice.''
   The Conservative Party leader, Andries Treurnicht, charged that
de Klerk's policies would lead to black rule. ``South Africa is at
the end of a failed political experiment, and the National Party
government is in disarray,'' he said.
   Zach de Beer, a co-leader of the Democratic Party, debated de
Klerk on what kind of stand he was taking.
   ``(De Klerk) condemns majority government and condemns minority
government but what form of government does he not condemn? He will
have to get off the fence some time or other.''
   De Klerk then responded, ``I said we will come with a whole new
constitution'' to be placed before voters in a referendum.
   De Beer replied, ``He says he will change the constitution. But
I am begging him to tell us how he will change it.''

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze pressured NATO on Friday to hold talks on eventually
eliminating short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, joining other alliance
leaders, said scrapping the weapons was out of the question as long
as the Warsaw Pact had a superiority in conventional forces and
tactical nuclear weapons.
   He held firm, however, on West Germany's insistence that talks
on reducing the weapons should be held promptly.
   Bonn's insistence on short-range arms negotiations has split the
alliance before a crucial NATO summit scheduled for the end of this
month.
   Shevardnadze arrived in Bonn one day after Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced a new arms reduction initiative
during a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   Gorbachev reiterated his call for negotiations on short-range
nuclear weapons, and also announced a proposal to withdraw 500
Soviet battlefield nuclear weapons from Europe unilaterally.
   Baker rejected the call for talks on short-range nuclear
arsenals, and said the other part of the initiative was a public
relations move.
   After arriving in Bonn, Shevardnadze referred to Baker's
reaction to Gorbachev's initiative.
   ``I wouldn't exactly say that our idea has stirred up a lot of
enthusiasm among the Americans,'' Shevardnadze said before
beginning talks with West German leaders.
   Shevardnadze repeated the Kremlin's call for the eventual
elimination of all short-range nuclear missiles.
   ``We have a lot of hard work ahead of us before we achieve the
third zero option,'' Shevardnadze said, using a disarmament term
for the elimination of the short-range weapons.
   ``This our ultimate goal,'' Shevardnadze said.
   But Kohl, following the NATO line, told reporters after his
meeting with Shevardnadze that total elimination was not an option
as long as the Warsaw Pact has superior conventional and nuclear
forces.
   ``My position has been very clear on this,'' Kohl said. ``For me
it is not realistic now to strive for a de-nuclearization of
Europe.''
   But the chancellor said he believed the Soviet proposals could
give impetus to movement in disarmament discussions.
   ``I think we are on the right path,'' Kohl said.
   Gorbachev's initiative has put new pressure on NATO as it tries
to work out a dispute over short-range nuclear weapons.
   West Germany also wants superpower talks on reducing tactical
nuclear arsenals, but it does not advocate their complete removal
under the current balance of military power in Europe.
   The United States and Britain fear such talks could lead to
total elimination of those arsenals in the face of the Warsaw
Pact's superior conventional forces.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher met with
Baker in Brussels on Friday to discuss the disarmament dispute and
the Soviet proposals.
   Baker said after the meeting that he had failed to persuade West
Germany to back off its demands for U.S. negotiations with the
Soviet Union to reduce nuclear missiles in Europe.
   Earlier Friday, Kohl praised the new Soviet initiative but also
urged the Kremlin to take further steps to erase its advantages in
conventional and nuclear forces.
   Genscher is to meet Shevardnadze again Saturday before the
Soviet official departs.
   The Soviet Union and West Germany are expected to sign a number
of agreements during the Gorbachev visit that will expand trade,
cultural and business ties.

   A 35-nation forum on press freedom ended without a
communique Friday as East bloc hard-liners rejected criticism of
their repressive practices from both East and West.
   Hungary's pledge to pull down ``No Photography'' signs was among
few promises made at the month-long forum to monitor compliance
with a new accord to improve the information flow between communist
and capitalist-minded nations.
   But delegates said the sometimes heated criticism gave hope for
improvements, and the inclusion of journalists added to the
openness of the meeting.
   ``The accomplishment is latent or potential, messages have been
conveyed,'' said Canadian chief delegate William Bauer.
   ``You have to maintain constant pressure and hope in the end
that the fear of being revealed as hypocrites will be greater than
the fear of losing power,'' said Bauer, ambassador to the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. That conference
ended in January with the signing of an accord on press freedom and
free speech.
   The London Information Forum brought together all the
signatories _ every European nation except Albania, plus Canada and
the United States.
   Romania, the most reluctant signatory, proved the major obstacle
to a final communique although East Germany and Czechoslovakia also
proved unwilling, delegates said.
   Leonard H. Marks, leader of the U.S. delegation and former head
of the U.S. Information Agency, said Romania was ``the odd man
out.''
   Officials from Romania, where typewriter owners have to license
their machines, could not obtain permission to sign a communique
for 48 hours. So more than 60 proposals tabled at the forum had to
be forwarded to the next meeting, in Helsinki in 1992.
   Proposals ranged from an East German-Czechoslovak call to
prevent distribution of neo-Nazi propaganda to a 29-point treatise
signed by members of NATO and the European Economic Community for
the scrapping of a wide range of restrictions on information and
the media.
   Bauer, Marks and others said they did not mind the lack of a
concluding statement because they got what they needed: ``some
forward motion in how these commitments are carried out.''
   Romania, East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia _ countries
Bauer said remain ``locked in a dark age of information'' _ drew
the most criticism.
   In an East-East outburst, Hungary charged Romania with breaking
the accord by banning ``an entire editorial staff from Hungarian
television.''
   Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria said such criticism was
counterproductive.
   ``There were instances when some of us were put in a position to
resist the attempts to slide our debate on the worn-out tracks of
confrontation,'' Philip Bokov, Bulgaria's chief delegate, told the
meeting Friday.
   Changes in Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union were applauded,
although Marks said ``this doesn't mean they've fully satisfied the
regulations.''
   Western governments did not escape unscathed, delegates said,
mostly because of journalists and other non-diplomatic delegates.
   ``They were loose cannon who could fire in any direction they
wished to and they took up their opportunity to do so,'' said Bauer.
   British delegates accused Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
curbing press freedom through measures such as a ban on broadcast
interviews with members of the outlawed Irish Republican Army and
its supporters.
   But not all discussions were critical, and signs of change
emerged.
   The Soviet Union promised to let foreigners use profits from the
sale of periodicals there to pay for their in-country expenses in
local currency.
   Several countries, including the United States, promised to
speed up journalists' visa application processes, and cut red tape
governing the import of high-tech equipment.
   Hungary promised to award visas at its borders to journalists
from countries that reciprocate and remove signs banning
photography.
   ``I can only confess that to date these notices have rather
drawn the attention of passers-by than kept away undesirable
scrutiny,'' chief delegate Laszlo Demus admitted.

<HEAD>Retailers Strike Back at Shoplifters With Letters Demanding Restitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The father of an 11-year-old girl was irate when a
drugstore chain sent him a letter demanding he fork over $100
because his daughter allegedly swiped an 89-cent tube of lip balm.
   He was successful in fighting the demand, but retailers across
the country are increasingly dispatching similar missives to
shoplifters and their parents, newly armed with state laws giving
stores more power to fight sticky fingers.
   ``The reason it's popular, it acts as a deterrent when the word
gets out: When you steal from the store, you're going to pay for
it,'' Carol Sommer, a founder of Civil Demand Associates in Sherman
Oaks, Calif., said in an interview Friday. The 4-year-old firm has
clients nationwide and is only one of several law firms dedicated
to this new weapon against shoplifting.
   The tactic of recouping shoplifting losses by sending demand
letters to shoplifters or their parents is known in the business as
``civil recovery'' or ``civil restitution.''
   ``It's a boon for getting some money back,'' said Jack Fraser,
operations chief for the New York-based National Retail Merchants
Association, which has 55,000 member stores.
   According to FBI figures gathered from police nationwide for
1987, the latest numbers available, there 1.1 million shoplifting
offenses averaging $96 per item.
   Since Nevada passed the country's first law offering retailers a
civil remedy in 1973, it has been joined by 34 others. The law
takes various forms, but the message is the same: Shoplifters won't
get away with just a red face; they can be hounded until they pay
up.
   Laws governing civil recovery vary widely from state to state.
But in all of them adult shoplifters are held liable for damages
and penalties. In about half the states, stores can go after minors
by making parents responsible for restitution, according to Delany
Stinson, senior investigations coordinator at Dayton Hudson
Department Store Co. in Minneapolis,
   Some states require that police be notified. Others, like
Massachusetts, do not.
   Some states restrict repayment to the value of the item. Others
allow the retailer to tote up the additional costs of crime
prevention, damage to displays or injuries that occurred when the
shoplifter was nabbed and even the cost of putting a new price tag
on the stolen merchandise, Ms. Stinson said.
   Mrs. Sommer of Civil Demand Associates stressed that demand
letters are not intended to generate profits.
   ``This is not a money-making operation,'' Mrs. Sommer said.
``It's meant to be a deterrent. That's really the bottom line.''
   ``Each time somebody gets in trouble, at least 20 people know
about it. The word does get into the community,'' said Lewis
Shealy, head of loss prevention at Marshall Field's and Co.
department stores. For five years the store has been demanding $300
from each shoplifter. Last year it recouped close to $100,000.
   ``That's paying the salary of at least six security guards,''
Shealy said from his Chicago headquarters, which spends about $5
million a year on guards and anti-theft devices.
   The success rate varies from 25 percent recovery to up to 90
percent, loss prevention experts say. The better-heeled the
shoplifter, the easier it is to collect restitution, largely
because they are easier to track down than more transient, lower
income earners.
   The Massachusetts case of the girl and the lip balm was an
instance of the retailer _ the CVS drugstore chain _ going further
than the law allows, the state attorney general said.
   Massachusetts law says parents of youngsters 7 to 17 years old
are only liable for the cost of the item. Adult shoplifters can be
taken to small claims court, where they may be ordered to pay $50
to $500 in damages on top of the item's cost.

   Randy Kraft, who authorities said
killed nearly 40 people in three states, was convicted by a jury
today of killing 16 young men in Southern California over 12 years
and could face the death penalty.
   In addition to the slayings in Orange County, authorities have
said Kraft is suspected of killing an additional 21 young men in
California, Oregon and Michigan.
   Jurors also found Kraft, a 44-year-old former Long Beach
computer programmer, guilty of one count of sodomy and one count of
sexual mayhem.
   Kraft sighed loudly as the court clerk began reading the
verdicts, then showed no other emotion during the 30-minute
recitation of guilty verdicts.
   Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin set a
Tuesday hearing to determine a date for the penalty phase of the
trial, during which jurors will hear about the other slayings for
which Kraft is suspected.
   Jurors had been deliberating since April 28 after seven months
of trial that included evidence of necrophilia and mutilation
surrounding the sex-related deaths of young men beginning in 1972.
   When Kraft was arrested, police said they found 47 color
photographs of young men, many of them nude and apparently dead.
   They also found a notebook with more than 60 handwritten
notations which prosecutors have called a ``death list.''
   Kraft was arrested May 14, 1983, when California Highway Patrol
officers pulled him over for erratic driving and discovered a
strangled Marine in the passenger seat of the car.

   Hackers infiltrated the European
Economic Community's computers twice last month, a spokesman said
Friday.
   Claus Ehlermann said the hackers were ``individuals just having
fun'' from Britain, the south of France, Switzerland and South
Africa.
   They obtained no confidential information, he said, because they
quickly were discovered when they penetrated computers of the EEC
commission's external relations, energy, personnel and spokesman's
departments.
   ``Our immediate reaction was to strengthen the defenses of the
system,'' Ehlermann said.
   He denied news reports that hackers also infiltrated the EEC's
computers in Geneva, which recieve sensitive information for
community negotiators at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   In October, a computer hacker revealed how he entered the
Belgian government's computer system and for several months read
the electronic mail of about 10 Cabinet ministers, including Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens.
   The hacker said he even met other ``burglars'' in the system,
which had confidential information such as details on terrorist
killings and the agenda of weekly Cabinet meetings.
   The government ordered an investigation and improved security.

<TEXT>
   KGB agents stormed an apartment in a Volga River
city on Friday and freed several hostages held for more than a day
by four escaped prisoners, Tass reported.
   It said the prisoners tortured one of their captives, a prison
employee, in the third hostage-taking reported in the Soviet Union
in a month.
   The official news agency said the four escapees also threatened
to throw a 2-year-old girl out a window.
   The incident began Wednesday, when the four, held for
investigation by authorities in the city of Saratov, took two women
workers hostage during a walk in a prison courtyard. They then
unlocked several cells and took two more hostages, demanding arms,
bulletproof vests, money and safe passage, Tass reported.
   According to the account, the escapees and their hostages were
allowed to leave, and they commandeered a car. They fired at
another car, abducted a woman who had testified against one of them
and seized a family, including the 2-year-old girl.
   At an apartment, they began negotiations with authorities,
demanded vodka and threatened to kill the hostages if their demands
were not met. A KGB task force stormed the apartment Friday.
   The tortured hostage was taken to a hospital for treatment, but
Tass did not describe the injuries.
   The news agency also did not say if the prisoners had been
charged initially or how many hostages had been taken in Saratov, a
city of 873,000 people about 450 miles southeast of Moscow.
   On April 12, two prison inmates in Voroshilovgrad in the Ukraine
took eight women hostage and demanded safe passage. One prisoner
was killed when authorities moved in.
   On April 24, authorities killed one prisoner who tried to break
out of a prison camp in Khabarovsk in the Soviet Far East, captured
two others and rescued four women taken hostage by the prisoners.

<HEAD>Great Lakes Governors Sign Cooperation Accord With Ontario</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Lakes governors agreed Friday to work
together with Ontario to promote their heartland region for
business and tourism.
   ``People talk about the East Coast and the West Coast,'' said
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, the new chairman of the Council of
Great Lakes Governors.
   ``But when you talk about what we have in the heartland. This is
a great region. ... We just haven't done enough.''
   Ontario Premier David Peterson said about $83 billion of the
trade between the two countries passes between central Canada and
the eight states making up the council.
   That is about half of the annual trade between the United States
and Canada.
   Besides boosting business, the agreement signed here also calls
for expanding environmental cooperation.
   The six governors on the trip to Canada met Thursday with Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney in Ottawa, where they announced they would
name a staff member to work on partnerships between Canadian and
U.S. business.
   ``As Great Lakes governors, we recognize the importance of
building new bridges of understanding to strengthen and enhance
cooperation,'' said Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, the council's
outgoing chairman.
   The council is a private, non-partisan organization established
in 1983 and intended to increase cooperation on environmental and
economic issues.
   The governors of Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and
Illinois visited both Ottawa and Toronto while New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo went only to Ottawa. The governors of Pennsylvania and
Indiana did not participate in the trip.
   The group was questioned repeatedly during public appearances
about an escalating controversy in Canada over reports that fuel
tainted with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, and other toxic
substances was exported from the United States.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, speaking to reporters on a boat
tour of Toronto's harbor, said the news was to be taken seriously
but ``it's something that's basically news to us.''
   The governors said regional environmental officials would meet
this summer to discuss the issue.
   Federal Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard announced Friday in
Ottawa that about 125 of the 175 border crossings between Canada
and the United States would be closed to oil tanker trucks so that
the fuel imports can be monitored.

   The United States, Spain and Italy have
agreed to increase their cooperation to thwart drug trafficking, an
Italian Interior Ministry source said Friday.
   The agreement came during a meeting in Madrid between U.S.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and officials from Spain's and
Italy's interior ministries, the source said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Thornburgh, FBI Director William S. Sessions and U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration chief John C. Lawn are attending a
two-day meeting of interior and justice ministers from the
12-nation European Economic Community.
   Thornburgh praised cooperation from Italy and Spain in
combatting drugs, particularly cocaine, brought into southern
Europe from Latin America, the source said.
   Spain and Italy have close historical, cultural and economic
ties with Latin America. U.S. officials hope to capitalize on those
ties in their anti-drug efforts, the source said.
   A meeting among top-level U.S., Spanish and Italian police and
narcotics officials is planned in Madrid next month to discuss
details of cooperation in drug-related matters, the Italian source
said.

   The first planes carrying
the Army's elite ``light, silent and deadly'' 7th Infantry Division
from Fort Ord left Friday on non-stop flights to Panama.
   Crews air-lifted howitzers, field cannons, trucks, trailers and
camouflaged soldiers under tight security as similar exercises were
under way with a 726-soldier infantry division at the Army's Fort
Polk, La., and the 165-member 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune,
N.C.
   President Bush ordered on Thursday that the combat troops be
deployed to protect Americans amid Panamanian post-election
violence.
   ``We're the most strategically deployable unit in the army,''
said 7th Division spokesman Maj. L.D. Walker. The self-proclaimed
``masters of the night'' carry mostly small arms, mortars and M-16
automatic rifles on their backs and can be ready for action
anywhere in the world within 18 hours.
   The General Accounting Office has reported that the 7th has been
bogged down by outdated, immobile and inefficient equipment, but
Army spokesman Maj. Phil Soucy disagreed, calling the division
``combat-ready.''
   At dawn, C-5 Galaxy jets began departing from the Travis
airstrip about 35 miles northeast of San Francisco. The Air Force's
largest plane, with seats for 73 soliders on its upper level and a
huge hold below, is capable of carrying 100 tons and has a cruising
speed of 500 mph.
   In addition, the Air Force loaded soliders into C-141
Starlifters in a deployment Lt. Col. Jim Dilda said could continue
into the night. He would not disclose the number of planes flying
to Panama or their exact destinations.
   Chief Warrant Officer Charles Rowe, with the 150 Camp Lejeune
Marines flying out of coastal North Carolina, described the
deployment as ``an open-ended commitment.''
   ``Just showing up will make a statement within itself,'' said
Marine Lance Cpl. James Camp of Peoria, Ill. ``That we're not going
to take any more of what's going on in Central American and those
little countries down there.''
   Most 7th Division soldiers approached by reporters said they
were instructed not to speak to the media. Those who did talk said
they were prepared, that the mission would be a good test of their
training and that they were just doing their jobs.
   ``The U.S. hasn't declared war. We're going down to protect
American citizens. There's not a lot to worry about,'' said Pfc.
Daniel Grabowski of Cleveland.
   Leaning against a jeep while waiting his turn to board a C-5,
the 20-year-old soldier assigned to the field artillery unit, said
this was his first foreign deployment since joining the military a
year ago.
   ``All I can do is what I'm told to do,'' said Cpl. Roger Little,
23, of Milwaukee, echoing other soliders' comments that they knew
little of the situation they were flying into. ``The president says
I've got to go. There's got to be a good reason.''
   The corporal in the air defense artillery section that operates
the highly potent Stinger missile expressed pride in the weapon,
but added, ``I hope we won't have to use it.''
   Spec. Brian Kimes, a 19-year-old artillery gunner from Denver,
said the mission interrupted important personal plans.
   ``This means I won't be able to make my girlfriend's graduation
from high school,'' he said. ``My leave was canceled by the alert.
I couldn't even call to let her know.''
   One soldier who refused to be interviewed was nevertheless in
good spirits before TV cameras. He smiled, waved and said, ``Hi,
Mom!'' Beaming, he turned to his companions and added, ``I've
always wanted to do that.''
   Sheila Coffey, 24, said her husband, Kent, barely had time to
say farewell to his family before leaving Fort Ord on the Monterey
Peninsula as troops rolled out for the trip.
   ``I kissed him goodbye and he hugged our two kids and that was
it,'' she said. ``He's just doing his job _ what he was trained
for. He's a good soldier. But I'll worry about him, of course.''

   The State Department said Friday it was
pleased by the Greek Supreme Court's ruling that a suspected
Palestinian terrorist was eligible for extradition.
   It urged the Greek justice minister to approve the decision.
   The court in Athens upheld an extradition order for Mohammed
Rashid, sought by the United States for the 1982 bombing of a Pan
Am jetliner in Hawaii which killed one person and injured 15.
   Rashid had appealed a lower court ruling granting his
extradition, and the high court had three times postponed a
decision on the sensitive case.
   ``We welcome this decision by the Greek Supreme Court,'' said
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. ``We note that this
decision was made against the background of threats by terrorists
who sought to unsuccessfully intimidate the Greek judicial
process,'' he added.
   Under Greek law, the minister of justice has the final word in
any extradition case, but a decision could be postponed until after
the June 18 general elections.
   ``We look forward to a positive decision on the case by the
Greek minister of justice,'' Boucher said.

   Maintenance depots and shipyards mismanaged
money from a special Pentagon program, an investigator told
Congress Friday moments after officials who oversee those
facilities warned that budget cuts are undermining the readiness of
U.S. forces.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, found that Army and Air Force maintenance depots, Navy
shipyards and public work centers used money from the program on
projects ``inconsistent with the program's original intent.''
   In some instances, administrative rules were not followed and
the facilities failed to keep adequate records, said Louis J.
Rodrigues, a GAO official who testified before the Senate Armed
Services subcommittee on readiness, sustainability and support.
   Earlier, Gen. Louis C. Wagner, Jr., commanding general of the
U.S. Army Materiel Command, told the panel that due to a 1.5
percent decline since fiscal 1987 in the budget for depot
maintenance, the purchase of spare and repair parts and military
construction ``everything suffered, including readiness.''
   ``We are living on the margin,'' Wagner said. ``The zero,
actually negative, real growth in funding is causing us concern
with our ability to meet requirements. Readiness today is being
maintained at the expense of sustainability during wartime.''
   Gen. Alfred G. Hansen, commander of the Air Force Logistics
Command, defined readiness as the ability to go to war and
sustainability as keeping those forces equipped to fight over an
extended period of time.
   ``Sustainability has suffered the past three to four years,
especially in spare parts,'' he said. ``Congress has taken out
about $700 million in sustainability in two years.''
   The commanders cautioned against reductions in the defense
budget for depot maintenance, spare parts and other logistics.
   Moments later, the GAO investigator described the problems his
agency has found with the program that enables depots and shipyards
to purchase equipment.
   Congress had asked the GAO to review the Pentagon's Asset
Capitalization Program, which has received about $5 billion from
fiscal 1983 to fiscal 1989.
   Under the program, facilities such as depots and shipyards buy
equipment with working capital funds rather than direct
appropriations. The program requires that a facility initially
finance the cost of the equipment and than charge its customers,
such as fleet commanders and weapon systems managers, for the work
performed.
   The facilities then recover the equipment cost by including the
depreciation expense in charges to its customers.
   The GAO found that the Yorktown Weapons Station in Virginia
bought an insect sprayer for $5,300 in 1984, used it about five
times in fiscal 1987 and not once since then. The sprayer was used
on areas near family housing and a golf course but had nothing to
do with the ``mission'' of the weapons station.
   At the Mare Island Shipyard near San Francisco, officials spent
$150,000 on 24 vehicles for its tenants even though they knew
Pentagon rules prohibit the use of those funds on tenant activities.
   ``Is this proper for government employees to do?'' Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich., asked of the apparent violation of rules.
   ``I don't think so,'' Rodrigues said.
   The GAO official attributed the problems to ``limited or unclear
guidance on how the (ACP program) should be managed.''
   Specifically, the agency found that ``no central ACP office or
coordinator was responsible for managing and overseeing all
equipment, minor construction and management information system
development projects.''
   The Defense Department agreed that the program was ``not yet a
sound capital investment program,'' Rodrigues said. The department
plans to take some action by the end of 1989, including naming a
single manager to oversee the program, he said.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Killed, Soldiers Start Returning to Bases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Territorial officials said police
killed a guerrilla Friday, and the United Nations said it needs
more monitors to check complaints against South African-led police
in Namibia.
   South African and territorial troops started returning to their
bases Friday, but Pretoria otherwise delayed the U.N. plan for
Namibia's independence _ a delay it blames on an April incursion of
several hundred South-West Africa People's Organization guerrillas
from Angola.
   Officials said they killed the guerrilla when he resisted arrest
at Miershoop, a town well south of the Angolan border. They gave no
details and did not identify the dead man. According to South
African figures, the shooting brings the toll to 316 guerrillas and
27 security force members killed since April.
   For two weeks, the military and counterinsurgency police have
been following tracks and interrogating villagers in the north to
verify whether the guerrillas have left. Several guerrillas have
been reported killed in the period, and a senior police officer was
relieved of duty after U.N. police monitors investigated complaints.
   ``There have been a very large number of complaints about the
situation in northern Namibia in the last few weeks,'' said U.N.
spokesman Cedric Thornberry. He did not elaborate.
   Police monitors already are busy investigating complaints
against police in the north, he said.
   U.N. Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari, in charge of
supervising the election process, is negotiating with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to increase the monitors
from 500 to 1,000, Thornberry said.
   Under the U.N. plan, Saturday was the deadline for South Africa
to scrap all discriminatory laws affecting elections and to reduce
its military forces in the territory from 50,000 to 12,000. It also
was the deadline for Namibian refugees, including disarmed SWAPO
fighters, to start returning.
   A spokesman for Louis Pienaar, the South African-appointed
administrator-general, said it was pointless to speculate on a
timetable until after a meeting Monday to verify whether all SWAPO
guerrillas have left Namibia.
   Observers from the United States, the Soviet Union and Cuba will
attend the meeting of Angolan and South African officials at
Ruacana, on the border of Angola and South Africa.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. said Friday the meeting
``will, in effect, determine whether the independence timetable can
go ahead as planned or whether it must be renegotiated.''
   Ahtisaari allowed South African soldiers and South-West African
paramilitary police to leave their bases April 1 to fight the
guerrillas. They returned to their bases two weeks ago for a
60-hour grace period to allow guerrillas to withdraw. But
territorial officials say 200-300 SWAPO fighters remain in Namibia.
   The soldiers began returning to their bases again Friday, in
preparation for renewed confinement to base from dawn Saturday.
   South Africa has agreed to grant independence to Namibia, which
it has controlled for 74 years, in exchange for the withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops in Angola. SWAPO guerrillas have fought from
Angolan bases in their 23-year war against South African occupation.

   People's Park, a hippie haven that
touched off a bloody riot 20 years ago, remains much as it was in
1969, a vacant lot that the University of California wants to
develop and activists want to see as a shrine to the '60s.
   ``This is going to be one of the top 10 or top 20 most important
pieces of land in history because it represents how the youth of
the '60s stood up to the big, powerful institutions that tried to
control their lives,'' said Jon Read, a landscaper who helped
organize the park project two decades ago.
   A virtual truce between activists and the university that began
in 1972 was disrupted last month when activists poured concrete for
a a permanent toilet at the park. The university had the concrete
torn up _ twice _ and had four activists who chained themselves to
the slab arrested.
   On Tuesday, religious activists moved a 66-foot mobile home set
up as a restaurant and dubbed the ``People's Cafe'' to the park to
feed the homeless. No immediate action was taken to remove the blue
trailer.
   But for the first time last week, UC-Berkeley officials said
longstanding plans to use the 2.3 acres for student housing and
recreational facilities are negotiable. Chancellor Ira Michael
Heyman's statement is considered a breakthrough by many of the
activists who tried to build People's Park in 1969.
   The university created the vacant lot, less than a mile from
campus, in 1967, tearing down a dozen buildings with the hopes of
building student housing and recreation facilities on the 2.3-acre
site.
   But in April 1969, activists attempted to claim the vacant
building site for ``the people,'' both to thumb their noses at the
establishment and because they believed the university's expansion
plans were insensitive to environmental concerns, said Read, 52.
   Thousands of activists, fraternity members, dropouts, elderly
residents and families trekked to the site with shovels and hoes to
plant flowers and roll sod.
   Matters came to a head on May 15, 1969, when the school tore up
the plants and put a fence around the site, and rioting ensued.
Sheriff's deputies shot dozens of protesters with shotguns. One,
James Rector, died a few days later; an artist was blinded and two
news reporters were among the wounded.
   Then-Gov. Ronald Reagan sent 2,000 National Guard troops to
occupy the city for 17 days. A nightly curfew was imposed and
meetings of more than three people were banned. In the first week
after the riot, 1,000 people were arrested.
   Demonstrators eventually tore down the park fence in 1972, and
the university agreed to give the public limited use on a temporary
basis.
   Since then, it has become a sort of no man's land, for the most
part overrun with drug dealers and transients, while the city and
the university blame each other for the park's deteriorating
condition.
   Today's city officials, who include some of the demonstrators of
1969, continue to fight development, for a variety of reasons.
   ``Ordinary people built a park out of a mudflat, and it came to
symbolize that the individual can make a difference, but the
university is still coming to grips with that,'' said Mayor Loni
Hancock, 49, who planted vegetables when the park was founded.
   ``You wouldn't build a volleyball court on the battlefield at
Gettysburg,'' she added.
   Heyman has called city council opposition to development of the
site a ``declaration of war.'' But he told reporters recently that
the issue could finally be resolved through negotiations with the
city over the university's long-range building plan.
   Aging activists are anxious for a resolution. There have been
rallies, marches, street fairs, ``teach-ins'' and civil
disobedience protests held to commemorate the park's 20th
anniversary.
   ``It's sacred ground and I hope we all succeed, someday, in
taking this land for everybody's enjoyment and use,'' said Jane
Goodwin, 47, who said she was wounded by a shotgun pellet during
the confrontation with police.
   The current Berlekeley student body president, Jeff Chang, who
was just 2 when the rioting took place, said today's students are
angry with the university for ``rolling back community efforts to
improve the park at every turn.''
   The university says that its rule against permanent facilities
on the spot is needed for legal reasons.
   Sociologist Todd Gitlin, a former president of the radical
Students for a Democratic Society, argues the police reaction to
the park symbolized the end of the radical political movements of
the '60s.
   ``People's Park was the last glimmering hope for a glad-eyed
movement, one that would be ecumenical, constructive and combative
all at once,'' he writes in ``The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of
Rage,'' published last year.

   Rising business inventories combined with poor
sales for the second consecutive month in March, a sign of economic
weakness, the government said Friday, but economists said the trend
is not worrisome yet.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and in
back lots climbed 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted $765.6
billion in March following a 0.4 percent rise in February.
   Business sales, meanwhile, were unchanged at a seasonally
adjusted $507.3 billion after plunging 0.9 percent in February, the
sharpest fall since January 1987.
   Rising inventories unaccompanied by sales increases sometimes
indicate a recession because manufacturers cut back production
until inventories are sold off. However, analysts said stockpiles
are not yet at troublesome levels.
   ``Inventories are fairly moderate,'' said economist Bruce
Steinberg of Merrill Lynch. ``There does not seem to be an excess
other than in the auto industry.''
   He said computerization and new inventory control techniques are
enabling businesses to respond more quickly to changes and sales,
preventing large backlogs from building.
   But economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago said inventories do bear watching. Anything more than a
moderate buildup could create a ``snap-the-whip effect'' and topple
the economy into a recession rather than the mild slowdown most
economists expect.
   ``We can't say there's been any rapid buildup ... but stocks
have been rising rapidly enough that they're vulnerable if sales
growth remains sluggish,'' he said.
   March business activity left the ratio of inventories to sales
at 1.51, meaning it would take 1.51 months to exhaust existing
inventories at the March sales pace. The ratio stood at 1.50 in
February and 1.48 in January.
   March's rise in inventories was led by a 0.5 percent gain at
manufacturing plants, followed by a 0.4 percent climb in retail
inventories and a 0.1 percent dip at the wholesale level.
   In sales, wholesalers showed a 0.2 percent gain and
manufacturers posted a 0.1 percent decline. Sales were unchanged at
retail stores in March. An advance report on retail sales in April,
released Thursday, showed a modest 0.4 percent gain.

   The Panamanian Consulate was closed to
walk-in traffic Friday after the consul general walked out, saying
she was overcome by the recent volume of visa requests as civil
unrest intensified in her homeland.
   Consul General Elizabeth Martinez said through an interpreter
she was ``completely swamped'' with requests for travel visas. She
said she had been processing between 100 and 130 requests per month
from all over the world.
   The Tampa consulate is the only location in the United States
that issues travel visas for Panama, Martinez said. That was
confirmed by a woman at the Panamanian Embassy in Washington who
would not give her name.
   Journalists seeking visas at the consulate said they were turned
away by security guards after Martinez left with her files.
   She said she was still processing visa requests by mail.
   Ms. Martinez said she could approve requests by tourists, but
journalists' requests must be sent to Panama.
   Hundreds of American military dependents evacuated their homes
Friday in Panama as the first contingent of U.S. troops headed for
the Central American nation in the wake of annulled national
elections.
   The State Department has issued a travel advisory for Panama,
saying Americans shouldn't travel there due to ``extremely
unsettled conditions'' in the wake of the annulled presidential
election there.

   Police on Friday deactivated three bombs
planted inside a car near an apartment building occupied by
political leaders of Guatemala's leftist insurgency, one of the
leaders said.
   Police discovered the bombs after the leaders, members of the
Guatemalan Opposition Representation Union, received an anonymous
telephone threat, said opposition leader Frank Larue.
   The caller told them Thursday they had 12 hours to leave the
country.
   Larue and other exiles affiliated with the rebel's military
umbrella group, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union, have
been in Guatemala since April to participate in reconciliation
talks called for by a Central American peace plan.
   Guatemalan guerrillas have been fighting the government for 30
years.
   Employees at the apartment building in southern Guatemala City
also found flyers carrying death threats against the opposition
leaders littered around the grounds of the building, Larue said.
   Earlier, they discovered a car parked outside their building
with the word, ``Leave'' painted on a box inside.
   Larue said firefighters told the exiles shortly after midnight
Friday they were alerted by an anonymous caller that the bombs were
outside the building.
   National Police bomb experts disarmed the three devices after
evacuating nearby residents, Larue said.
   Another exiled leader, Rolando Castillo, told reporters he had
received death threats just before a coup attempt on Tuesday by
rebellious air force officers and troops against the government of
President Vinicio Cerezo.
   At least 10 officers have been jailed in connection with the
uprising, which was put down by loyalist troops without a shot
being fired.

   One in five Californians has been tested
for the AIDS virus but few have taken steps to reduce the risk of
contracting the deadly illness, according to a Gallup Poll.
   The poll, paid for by hospital executives, found that while the
majority of residents have received some AIDS education, the
message is reaching a disproportionately low percentage of ethnic
minorities and poor people. Those are the groups in which the
disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is spreading the most
rapidly.
   The survey, part of the Third Annual California Health Care
Poll, was one of the most comprehensive to be conducted in the
state, said George Gallup, who released the study Thursday.
   A demographic breakdown of those questioned indicated 22 percent
with a high school education or less were not aware of any AIDS
education programs, while 25 percent with incomes of less than
$20,000 said they were unaware. Among those with an annual income
of $75,000 or more awareness rose to 90 percent, the poll found.
   Only 26 percent of blacks and 38 percent of Asians had received
some AIDS education, according to the survey.
   The results indicated that some education is reaching most
Californians, but ``it suggests that the message be deepened and
that we find new approaches for reaching those who are not getting
the most effective messages possible,'' said Gallup.
   The poll was conducted in April by telephone to a sample of
1,000 California households and was designed by the Gallup
Organization, Inc., producers of the Gallup Poll, and executives
with the Southern California Hospital Council, said Robert Nielsen,
vice president of the Gallup Organization.
   The margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percent.
   One-quarter of Californians fear becoming infected by the AIDS
virus, but only 15 percent have changed their way of life to
prevent contracting the illness, the poll found.

   Academy Award-winning actress Greer Garson
has donated $3 million to the College of Santa Fe to develop a
movie studio for academic and commercial use.
   Miss Garson, who lives in Dallas, did not attend Thursday's
announcement of the gift but said in a tape-recorded message that
it represented an interest in education and the arts shared by
herself and her late husband, Dallas oilman E.E. ``Buddy'' Fogelson.
   Miss Garson is expected to attend the Aug. 12 groundbreaking for
the Garson Communication Center. A gymnasium will be converted into
a sound stage and production facility that university President
James Fries said could be the cornerstone of a developing film
industry in New Mexico.
   Miss Garson won an Academy Award for 1942 for her portrayal of
``Mrs. Miniver,'' and received several Oscar nominations in the
1940s. She and Fogelson were longtime benefactors of the College of
Santa Fe, building the Greer Garson Theater Center in 1965,
establishing an endowment for student awards and guest artist
programs in 1967, and building the Fogelson Library Complex in 1970.

   A fire swept through a tunnel on the

11, police said Friday.
   Hundreds of cars and trucks lined up for about three miles on
either side of the Brenner highway tunnel as the busy road link
between Italy, Austria and West Germany was closed to traffic for
eight hours.
   The blaze spread quickly through the polyurethane cover of the
tunnel, causing thick, toxic smoke, police said.
   A team of 13 workers was on duty when the fire began in the
northbound lane of the tunnel, which has Italian customs at one end
and Austrian customs at the other.
   The injured, suffering from smoke inhalation, burns and
contusions, were taken to nearby hospitals where two were reported
in serious condition.

   Thousands of protesters Friday
chanted ``Get out, Yankee devils!'' as radical student leaders
pledged to press a drive to oust President Roh Tae-woo and expel
U.S. forces.
   Thousands more protested in the southern city of Kwangju to
denounce the death of a 24-year-old militant student activist who
had been wanted by police.
   Newspapers in Seoul reported that Roh would shuffle part of his
Cabinet in June in response to an opposition demand for an
extensive government reorgnaization.
   About 4,000 radical student representatives from throughout the
country gathered at a college near Taejon to discuss strategy and
prepare nationwide anti-government protests. Student leaders at the
rally called for the expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed
in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   Students at the rally chanted ``Punish Yankee imperialism!'' and
``Get out, Yankee devils!''
   Authorities mobilized 4,000 riot police for the rally at
Chungnam University, but troopers did not intervene.
   In Kwangju, an estimated 7,000 people staged a peaceful protest,
demanding that authorities thoroughly investigate the death of Lee
Chol-kyu, whose body was found Wednesday.
   About 3,000 people chanted anti-government slogans outside the
morgue where Lee's body lay. About 30 students cut their fingers
and wrote ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' in blood on placards.
   Dissident groups claim the Chosun University student was
tortured and killed by police, but an initial autopsy showed no
signs of torture. Police denied involvement, and Roh has ordered an
inquiry.
   Police in Kwangju and nearby towns were put on special alert for
possible civil unrest because of Lee's death and a rally planned
for Saturday.
   Lee's death came a week before the anniversary of an
anti-government civil uprising in Kwangju in 1980 that left about
200 people killed and more than 800 injured, by official count.
Dissidents claim the casualty toll was much higher.
   Lee's death appeared to fuel anti-government sentiment there.
About 7,000 riot police were positioned around campuses and along
main streets in the city, reports said. No clashes were reported.
   Seoul newspapers, quoting unidentified government sources,
reported Roh would reshuffle his Cabinet after the National
Assembly session ends May 29.
   During the session, opposition parties demanded Prime Minister
Kang Young-hoon and his 22-member Cabinet resign to take
responsibility for a wave of violent protests that left six
policemen dead in a clash with students.
   The government would replace some Cabinet members, including the
home and labor ministers, the newspapers said.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-government
protests and labor strikes in recent months. Police have rounded up
about 230 radical students, workers and dissidents in the past
month.
   Radical students and the dissident groups have little support
because of their violent tactics and extreme political views. The
radicals have been calling for the overthrow of Roh and the
creation of a leftist state ruled by workers and farmers.

   Sudan is acting as mediator for its
war-battered neighbor, Ethiopia, holding peace talks between the
Marxist government and the East African nation's largest rebel
movement, newspapers said Friday.
   Reports in three independent dailies indicate some movement
toward settling prolonged and expensive insurrections in both Sudan
and Ethiopia, which each support rebel movements fighting the
other's government.
   The three newspapers said no date has been set for the
conference, but that Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam and
leaders of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front have agreed to
direct negotiations in Khartoum.
   Sudanese Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi has said several times that
``peace is indivisible'' in northeastern Africa.
   Such comments are taken to mean he would end his support for
separatist rebels in Ethiopia's northernmost province of Eritrea
and other anti-Mengistu groups if the Ethiopian leader would
abandon the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Front.
   Eritrean rebels, who also espouse Marxism, have prosecuted
Africa's longest civil war. It began in 1961 and continued after
Mengistu and a clique of army officers deposed Emperor Haile
Selassie in 1974.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front boycotted an April
meeting in Khartoum involving Ethiopian officials and
representatives of four other Eritrean nationalist movements,
reportedly because of the type of autonomy the Addis Ababa
government wanted to discuss. In the absence of the largest rebel
group, the talks dissolved into squabbling and broke up with no
progress.
   The Khartoum newspapers reported that Mahdi gained approval for
the talks from the Eritrean Front's Secretary-General Asiasi Aforgi
at a meeting in the Sudanese capital last month.
   Mengistu informed Sudan of his government's ``complete
agreement'' to further discussions on causes of the rebellion and
to ``find a peaceful solution ... within the framework of a united
Ethiopian state,'' the newspaper Al-Ayam reported.
   Rancorous for years, relations between Sudan and Ethiopia have
improved in recent months, coinciding with major battlefield
successes by rebel groups in both countries.
   Sudan's civil war began six years ago when rebels from the
south, where the minority Christians and animists are in a
majority, took up arms in demand of more autonomy from the dominant
Moslems of the north. Hundreds of thousands of people have died as
a result, mostly civilians who starved from war-induced famine.
   On May 1, rebel leader John Garang declared a unilateral
month-long cease-fire that will help a massive U.N. relief effort 1
to stockpile food and save thousands from starvation before annual
heavy rains that cut off much of the region.
   Ethiopia and Sudan, which the World Bank says are among the
world's poorest nations, each spend more than a million dollars a
days prosecuting their wars.

   A communist rebel has confessed
to taking part in the April killing of a U.S. Army colonel,
officials said Friday, but they have not charged him because he
keeps changing his story.
   Ricardo Prestosa said rebels assassinated Col. James ``Nick''
Rowe because he was a ``big hindrance to the revolutionary
movement,'' according to a recorded confession played to reporters
by Brig. Gen. Cesar Nazareno.
   Rowe, 51, was slain April 21 outside the headquarters of the
Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in suburban Quezon city as he
was being driven to work. He was a Vietnam War hero from McAllen,
Texas, whose book ``Five Years to Freedom'' describes his five
years of imprisonment by the Viet Cong and his escape. In the
Philippines, he commanded U.S. ground forces.
   A senior Philippine officer said Prestosa, 29, admitted the
slaying Thursday to police in Bataan province, where he was
arrested, but recanted Friday and has repeated the confession
several times since then.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said the rebel was
transferred to Manila for further investigation. He was arrested
Wednesday in his hometown of Dinalupihan, 40 miles west of the
capital, across Manila Bay in Bataan.
   Nazareno, the regional constabulary commander, said nothing
about Prestosa's renunciation, and the Bataan police commander,
Col. Ramsey Ocampo, denied in a telephone interview that a
confession was made at all. The line was cut, however, and efforts
to contact him again were unsuccessful.
   A senior officer under Ocampo's command said Prestosa claimed to
have taken part in the attack on Rowe. He said investigators doubt
the confession because Prestosa ``appeared confused'' and ``kept
changing his story.''
   Nazareno said no charges have been filed.
   In the tape, Prestosa said in the Tagalog language that he knew
Rowe because ``we had been watching him for a long time.''
   ``Why did you kill him?'' the interrogator asked.
   ``Because he was a big hindrance to the revolutionary
movement,'' Prestosa replied.
   The communist New People's Army claimed responsibility the day
after the slaying, saying its fighters killed Rowe because of
alleged U.S. interference in the Philippine government's
counterinsurgency campaign.
   Officials could give no reason for Prestosa's apparent confusion.
   ``He wants to insinuate he was there,'' the officer said. ``When
questioned repeatedly he says `yes.' Then, after a while, after
thinking things over, he backs out.''
   At least two details in Prestosa's recorded account did not jibe
with fact, another reason investigators are wary.
   Prestosa claimed Rowe was killed ``around 10 a.m.,'' but police
and witnesses say he was assassinated at 7:10 a.m.
   The rebel also said the killers abandoned a car in Manila's Paco
district. But police said they found the car in the San Francisco
del Monte district, four miles from Paco.
   Communist rebels have been fighting for 20 years to overthrow
the government.

   At least 97 students from two schools
were hospitalized after eating a free lunch provided under a new
government program, news reports and officials said Friday.
   The incident occurred Thursday in the Anuradhapur district, 103
miles northeast of Colombo.
   Most of the students, aged 8-19, showed symptoms of food
poisoning but were discharged later in the day, Anuradhapur
Education Director E.S.W. Perera said in an interview.
   Elmo Gooneratna, senior assistant secretary for education,
blamed the local government for employing food contractors despite
instructions for schools to preapre the food.
   ``The contractors, unconcerned about health standards, were
supplying the meals only with the intention of making profits,'' he
said. ``In one instance a contractor was found transporting buns in
a hearse.''
   The free meal scheme began on May 2 and will cost $59 million a
year, Gooneratna said.
   Lunches consist of rice and curries or buns with fish or eggs
and are supposed to provide 600 to 800 calories. The project is to
help raise nutritional standards in Sri Lanka, where more than 40
percent of the 16 million people live below the poverty line.

<HEAD>`Brilliant Pebbles' Concept Likely to Undergo Changes, Research Head
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new head of the Star Wars research program
said Friday he has doubts whether the highly publicized ``Brilliant
Pebbles'' concept of space-based defenses will be deployed as it is
now envisioned.
   ``I have to be skeptical,'' said Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr.,
who took command of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization
on Feb. 1.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and the former head of SDIO, Lt.
Gen. James Abrahamson, have placed great hope in Brilliant Pebbles,
a system of 3,000 to 5,000 space-based interceptors. Each would be
about four feet long, weighing less than 100 pounds, and would have
the capability to spot, track and destroy enemy intercontinental
ballistic missiles.
   Earlier concepts for other systems called for deployment of
several hundred satellites, each equipped with about 10 Space-Based
Interceptors (SBI) to destroy enemy rockets, with an estimated
deployment cost of $69.1 billion.
   Abrahamson said in an unusual ``end of tour'' memorandum that
Brilliant Pebbles could be deployed for $25 billion, including a
separate system of surveillance satellites.
   Monahan, however, in his first meeting with reporters, declined
to project a deployment price for Brilliant Pebbles, and said his
organization had not sharply increased money devoted to the project.
   Current Pentagon spending on Brilliant Pebbles research is
running at an annual rate of $46 million, said Monahan, up from the
1988 level of $40 million, but the funding level is likely to
change based on the outcome of a review this summer.
   President Bush has lowered the proposed Star Wars budget from
$5.9 billion to $4.6 billion for the current year, a level that
Monahan says will delay development of the entire system for about
two years.
   At the current pace of research, Monahan said, the Pentagon
should have enough information to allow the president and Congress
to decide by 1993 or 1994 whether to deploy a ballistic missile
defense system.
   Brilliant Pebbles and other space-based systems will be reviewed
this summer by the Defense Science Board, a Pentagon group, and the
Jasons, a team of university scientists, said Monahan.
   One possible outcome of that review might be a decision to
combine elements from Brilliant Pebbles and other systems, for
example placing two, three or four interceptors aboard each
satellite, he said.
   Brilliant Pebbles, developed at the government's Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California, solves a number of
problems that had vexed Star Wars researchers, he said, but the
sheer number of envisioned ``Pebbles'' created new communications
and production challenges.
   ``From what we see today, things look doable. But we are not yet
ready to jump out ahead on it,'' said Monahan.
   A key problem that scientists must solve for Brilliant Pebbles,
said Monahan, was communicating to the satellites the command to
open fire on enemy boosters within the first two minutes of their
flight.
   ``You have to pull the trigger real fast,'' he said. The
decision must be made by human beings and not by computers, he said.
   Abrahamson and the chief scientist in the Brilliant Pebbles
program, Lowell Wood, have called Brilliant Pebbles a major
breakthrough because the system would be made on a production line,
vastly reducing the cost.
   But Monahan declined to speculate on the cost.
   ``Nobody has yet mass-produced spacecraft before,'' he said.

   More than two-thirds of the U.S. border crossings
open to fuel imports will be closed to oil tanker trucks in an
effort to keep tainted products from entering Canada, the federal
government announced Friday.
   The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Monday that solvents, PCBs
and waste oil were mixed secretly into fuels in the past four
years, sold to customers in western New York, and taken across the
border for sale in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
   Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard announced at a news
conference in Ottawa that oil tanker trucks will be able to enter
Canada at only 50 of the approximately 175 border crossings used
for petroleum products.
   Bouchard said the new federal action ``will concentrate on spot
check sampling of fuel cargos crossing the international borders.''
He said the provincial governments of Ontario, Quebec and Alberta
will carry out sampling in the fuel distribution system.
   The report in the Globe and Mail, which calls itself ``Canada's
national newspaper,'' quoted unidentifed law enforcement sources
and participants in what it said was lucrative illicit trafficking.
It said more than 50 interviews were conducted over the past five
months in western New York and Toronto.
   It said the shipments of altered gasoline, diesel and industrial
heating fuel originated in New York state.
   Bouchard also announced that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
would lead a task force investigating the report that millions of
gallons of imported fuel were contaminated by the the toxic wastes.
   U.S. governors from the Great Lakes state visiting Canada on
Thursday and Friday were asked repeatedly at their public
appearances about the report.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, speaking to reporters on a boat
tour of Toronto harbor, said the news was to be taken seriously,
but ``it's something that's basically news to us.''
   The governors said state environmental officials would discuss
the issue at a summer meeting.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the National Association of
Wheat Growers said Friday he has urged the Agriculture Department
to keep restrictions on 1990 production despite severe losses to
this year's crop.
   Reggie Wyckoff, a Genoa, Colo., wheat farmer, said in a letter
to department officials that allowing all-out production next year
would ``do serious damage to the level of recovery'' that has been
achieved so far.
   The USDA is required by law to announce by June 1 the level of
land-idling that will be required in order for 1990 producers to
qualify for federal price supports and other benefits on their
wheat crop.
   Wheat farmers were required to set-aside 10 percent of their
wheat base acres for 1989. But drought and late-season freezes in
Kansas and some other major winter wheat states have trimmed this
year's harvest outlook sharply.
   The department may be under some pressure to discontinue its
acreage reduction program, or ARP, in 1990, he said. A zero
requirement ``could put the U.S. back on a rapid course'' to
surpluses, Wyckoff added.
   Next year's idling requirement should not be larger that the 10
percent for 1989, he said.

<HEAD>Scandal-Tainted Governing Party at a Loss for a Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scandal-plagued governing party was at a loss
for a leader Friday after senior politician Masayoshi Ito refused
requests that he lead the party and government.
   Analysts commenting on the unexpected refusal cited Ito's
statements that the Liberal Democratic Party does not realize how
seriously it has been damaged by an influence-peddling scandal that
has shrunk its popularity rating in polls to less than 4 percent.
   ``Mr. Ito formally expressed his rejection ... and, despite
party leaders' persistent attempts to persuade him, did not change
his position,'' party spokesman Ryutaro Hashimoto told a news
conference.
   ``Frankly, we are at a loss,'' he said.
   Ito, 75, is among a handful of senior members of the party
untainted by the Recruit scandal, which has forced Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita to announce his resignation. Takeshita is expected
to step down later this month, and three of his Cabinet ministers
already have resigned.
   Fourteen businessmen and ex-bureaucrats have been arrested on
bribery or other charges in connection with sales of unlisted,
bargain-priced shares in a subsidiary of Recruit Co., an
information conglomerate.
   The party had asked Ito to replace Takeshita and improve the
party's image before summer elections for half the seats in the
upper house of Parliament. Because the party has a huge majority in
Parliament, its leader is virtually guaranteed to become prime
minister.
   Hashimoto said Ito's reasons for refusing were his health and
disagreements with party leaders over reform and the way the party
is taking responsibility for the scandal.
   This week, Ito complained the party lacks a sense of crisis, and
he told reporters ``revolutionary changes in the party's way of
thinking are needed.''
   He had demanded the resignations of all politicians linked to
corruption cases and an end to factions in the party, which is made
up of half a dozen cliques.
   Fund-raising plays a major role in factionalism and the scandal.
Takeshita has admitted receiving more than a million dollars in
donations from Recruit.
   ``Ito wanted the job, but didn't feel he would be able to carry
out reform under the current circumstances,'' said political
analyst Asao Yamaguchi.
   ``There is really no feeling of crisis in the party. They have
been at the top so long they just don't realize the danger, and it
will take big losses at the polls to open their eyes,'' he said.
   In a Saturday editorial, the nationally circulated newspaper
Asahi Shimbun agreed.
   ``There was a gaping crevice between Ito and the other LDP
members, including Takeshita, over the degree to which they
recognized the people's fury toward politics. That crevice was
never bridged,'' it said.
   Former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, head of the party
faction to which Ito belongs, told reporters he does not see the
rejection as final and will try to change Ito's mind.
   The party's top four executives, Ito among them, are to meet
Saturday to pursue the question of a leader.
   Yamaguchi said Shin Kanemaru, a former deputy prime minister and
Takeshita's mentor, now is the most likely candidate for prime
minister.
   However, Kanemaru is only a year younger than Ito and, like him,
suffers from diabetes.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday revived
an Eisenhower-era ``open skies'' proposal for mutual East-West
surveillance flights, as he exhorted the Soviet Union to begin a
friendship ``that knows no season of suspicion, no chill of
distrust.''
   He praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political
reforms and new policies of openness, but he also declared, ``Mr.
Gorbachev, don't stop now.''
   To show there is nothing to hide, he suggested, other members of
the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and of NATO should join the superpowers
in allowing unarmed aerial intelligence-gathering flights over
their territories.
   ``Such surveillance flights, complementing satellites, would
provide regular scrutiny for both sides,'' Bush said. ``The very
Soviet willingness to embrace such a concept would reveal their
commitment to change.''
   The president commented in a speech to graduating seniors at
Texas A&amp;M University. He received an honorary doctoral degree and
quipped to the students, ``Your last day of college had to end with
another political science lecture.''
   Bush, announcing the completion of his administration's 3{-month
review of U.S.-Soviet relations, also said he would work with
Congress to ease a 15-year-old denial of trade credits in
recognition of Moscow's liberalizing of emigration for Soviet Jews.
   His speech was one of a series of foreign-policy addresses
planned by the president.
   It came a day after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told
Secretary of State James A. Baker III that the Soviets would
withdraw 500 short-range nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe.
   For his part, Bush did not respond directly to that gesture,
though he called on the Soviet Union to make deeper cuts in
conventional forces in Europe.
   However, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft told
reporters aboard Air Force One that Gorbachev's announcement was
``a ploy'' that he said ``is designed principally to create
problems within the (NATO) alliance.''
   The administration has opposed East-West talks on eliminating
NATO's tactical nuclear weapons, a stance that has caused a rift
with West Germany and several other NATO allies.
   Bush mixed new overtures to ease East-West barriers with a dose
of the kind of skepticism he has expressed before, urging Gorbachev
to match promises of a new openness with deeds.
   ``The Soviet Union has promised a more cooperative relationship
before, only to reverse course and return to militarism. Soviet
foreign policy has been almost seasonal _ warmth before cold, thaw
before freeze,'' Bush said.
   He called on the Soviets to permit the distribution of banned
newspapers and books, to disavow links with terrorist nations such
as Libya, to tolerate more political dissent within its borders and
to free Eastern Europe from its grip.
   ``One day, it should be possible to drive from Moscow to Munich
without seeing a single guard tower or strand of barbed wire,'' he
said.
   ``In short, tear down the iron curtain,'' Bush said, echoing
former President Reagan's 1987 appeal at the Berlin Wall to
Gorbachev to ``tear down this wall.''
   Bush praised recent moves toward political and economic reform,
saying ``a new breeze is blowing'' in the Soviet Union _ echoing
the phrase he used in his inauguration speech.
   ``We are impressed by limited but freely contested elections. We
are impressed by a greater toleration of dissent. We are impressed
by a new frankness about the Stalin era.''
   ``Mr. Gorbachev, don't stop now,'' he added.
   Bush's idea for surveillance flights was an effort to breathe
new life into a proposal first made by President Dwight Eisenhower
in 1955.
   Eisenhower's ``open skies'' proposal, rejected by the Soviets at
the time, called for both the Soviets and the United States to send
surveillance flights over each other's territory to check on
military installations.
   Bush aides said NATO allies had been consulted on the new
proposal, and while some, especially Canada, had welcomed it,
others had reserved judgment.
   A White House official, speaking on the condition that his name
not be used, said Baker had presented the proposal this week to
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Such a plan might seem less significant now, with the
high-definition photographic capability of spy satellites, than in
Eisenhower's time.
   However, ``symbolically it's very important,'' Scowcroft said.
   He also said planes would have some advantage over satellites in
cloudy conditions.
   A fact sheet distributed by the White House said that details,
including who would provide the aircraft for the surveillance
flights, would have to be determined later if Moscow agreed to the
propsal.
   Decisions on surveillance flights over other countries would
have to be decided by each nation, the official said.
   Bush also said he was ready to work with Congress in easing the
landmark Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 Trade Act that denied
most-favored-nation trade status to the Soviet Union so long as it
barred free emigration.
   Bush said he was heartened by recent moves to permit Soviet Jews
to leave the country. As recently as Thursday, Moscow told the
United States that 24 Jewish families long denied emigration would
be permitted to leave.
   Some 19,000 Soviet Jews were permitted to leave last year.
   Bush said, ``Should the Soviet Union codify its emigration laws
in accord with international standards and implement its new laws
faithfully, I am prepared to work with Congress for a temporary
waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.''
   Early reaction from Jewish groups was positive.
   For example, Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said in a
statement: ``President Bush has set fair and firm conditions for
the granting of a waiver. ... Those conditions offer a test of
Soviet intentions. We trust that the USSR will meet that test and
institutionalize by law the reforms it has begun to put into effect
in its emigration practices.''
   However, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., urged Bush to be cautious,
saying that ``no waiver should be granted until after open
emigration policies have been in effect over a long enough period
to prove the Soviets are committed to permanent and open
emigration.''

   An exhausted, eight-man expedition seeking to
dramatize environmental hazards in the Arctic has been hampered by
melting ice on the last days before its expected arrival at the
North Pole.
   ``They're walking non-stop, it seems,'' spokeswoman Tracey
Carpenter said in a telephone interview from Icewalk expedition
headquarters in Ottawa. ``They're zigzagging around all this broken
ice and making good progress.''
   On arrival, the expedition's leader, British explorer Robert
Swan, will become the first man to walk to the North and South
poles. He reached the South Pole with two other men in 1986.
   Progress has been slower than hoped in the last leg because of
the early spring weather conditions that produce crumbling,
drifting ice and the threat of open seas.
   ``It's looking good. We're pretty convinced that it's going to
be Sunday,'' Carpenter said.
   She said the expedition was 28 miles from the North Pole on
Friday. The men have been averaging 14 miles daily.
   Plans are for an Icewalk flight to pick up the expedition on
Sunday at the North Pole and fly them to Eureka on Ellesmere Island.
   The expedition, which has a $4 million budget, had hoped to
complete the 457-mile trek by mid-May at the latest. The departure
was several days later than hoped because of heavy snow in March.
Temperatures have been warmer than expected in recent days,
reaching as high as 28 degrees Fahrenheit.
   ``It's just wending their way through half water, half ice,''
Carpenter said.
   Solar flares have frequently disrupted radio contact since the
expedition began March 20 from Cape Aldrich on Ellesmere Island.
Supply flights have succeeded in reaching them.
   It differs from other Arctic expeditions in using only human
power to travel and take supplies along. The eight men ski, but do
not use dogsleds or skimobiles.
   The explorers have been gathering air and snow samples along
their route, as well as collecting data on the effect of cold on
humans.
   Canadian research over the past four years in the Arctic has
turned up dozens of pesticides and other toxic substances in the
region's fragile ecosystem, many of them entering the food chain.
Attention also has focused on the thinning of the world's ozone
layer, most notably at the world's poles, and on acid rain.
   The Icewalk team includes members from Britain, Canada, the
United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, Australia and West Germany.
   The American is Darryl Roberts, from New York City. He had
suffered frostbite on his feet in April when temperatures fell to
67 degrees below zero.
   ``Since the beginning there was great concern that he'd have to
(leave),'' Carpenter said. ``He was very committed to carrying on.''
   The Soviet member, Dr. Mikhail Malakov, treated Roberts and four
others for frostbite. Malakov, who also experienced frostbite,
completed the successful Canada-Soviet Polar Bridge Expedition last
year.

<TEXT>
   Overcoming bad lighting and computer problems,
13-year-old Albert Kurz of Holland, Pa., became the nation's sixth
MathCounts champion Friday by calculating the price of a stock.
   The finals in the junior high school math competition, sponsored
by NASA, the National Society of Professional Engineers and other
organizations, capped nine months of local and state contests
entered by more than 700,000 students.
   A total of 224 math whizzes _ all but 30 of them boys _ made it
to the countdown rounds in Washington. As the winner, Albert takes
home a $10,000 scholarship, a gold medal and a personal computer.
He will also spend a week at the U.S. Space Camp in Huntsville,
Ala., and on Monday he goes to the White House to meet President
Bush.
   Lenny Ng of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Robert Kleinberg of Wales
Center, N.Y., the second and third place finishers, received
scholarships of $6,000 and $4,000, respectively. They will also
visit the space camp, as will Ng's three colleagues on the
top-scoring state team from North Carolina.
   No calculators are permitted in the competition. Students use
pencil, paper and their minds to figure out the problems.
   The 10 finalists viewed problems on computer monitors and
punched buzzers to indicate they were ready with answers _
sometimes even before the master of ceremonies had started reading
the problem to the audience.
   There were a number of tense moments, some because the lighting
made it hard to see who had hit his buzzer. And the last round was
delayed by a computer malfunction.
   Albert fended off all challengers with lightning-fast answers to
questions such as: ``The diagonal of a cube is the square root of
27. What is the volume?'' and ``If y equals the negative value of
the absolute value of x minus 2, for what value of x will y attain
its maximum value?''
   The answers: 27 and 2.
   The winning problem posed the following question: ``The price of
a stock increased 10 percent and then decreased 10 percent before
it was sold for $99. What was the original price of the stock?''
Albert gave the correct answer of $100.
   ``I spent nights from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. studying and it really
paid off,'' Albert said after his victory. When asked how he could
figure problems so quickly, he replied, ``I can't do them on paper
because my hand's too shaky to write. I don't know. I just do it.''
   Albert said his mother is a housewife and his father a civil
engineer. He said his hobbies include basketball, ping pong and
computer games, and he would like to become ``either an engineer or
a mathematician.''
   MathCounts is described as the only national math coaching and
competition program for junior high school students. It is designed
to stimulate students' interest in math before they must make
course decisions that may affect their career choices.
   Other MathCounts sponsors in addition to NASA and the engineers
association are CNA Insurance Cos., the National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics, Cray Research Foundation and General
Motors Foundation.

   Poultry output is expected to rise this year
in the wake of declining supplies of beef and pork, the Agriculture

   ``Total poultry meat production likely will increase 4 percent,
while red meat supplies are expected to be 2 percent below last

net returns are projected for broiler, turkey and egg producers in

   But hog farmers are expected to see market prices ``below
break-even'' for the year. Returns for cow-calf producers ``should
remain above cash costs,'' the report added.

<HEAD>Sharp Seasonal Increase in Hired Hands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of workers employed by farmers
showed a sharp seasonal increase this spring but trailed year-ago
levels, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   A quarterly report said the hired work force on farms was
estimated at 830,000 workers during the week of April 9-15 used for
a survey, compared with 936,000 a year earlier. In January, the
previous survey showed 701,000 hired workers on farms.
   Those did not include 198,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. A year earlier those
totaled 224,000 workers.
   The report said rain during the survey week slowed field work in
the Southeast and most of the Delta. Also, spring wheat planting
was behind the normal pace in the major production states.
   The report said the national figures for hired workers had a
sampling error of 5.1 percent.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $5.35
per hour, up from $5 per hour a year earlier but below the average
of $5.51 in January, the report said.
   For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage
rate available. However, workers in California were reported at
$6.45 per hour in April, compared with $6.42 in January and $5.68 a
year earlier. Florida workers averaged $6.24, $5.79 and $6.15 per
hour, respectively.

<HEAD>Judge Accepts Maximum $100 Million Settlement in San Juan Hotel Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIO GHIGLIOTTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday accepted
the proposed payment of up to $100 million to settle hundreds of
lawsuits stemming from the 1986 Dupont Plaza Hotel fire that killed
97 people.
   U.S. District Court Judge Raymond L. Acosta said he was
``generally satisfied'' with the out-of-court settlement in one of
the largest disaster litigations in American history.
   He said the agreement was binding on all parties but contingent
on unspecified conditions being met within 60 days. The judge said
the first of three phases of the complex trial will remain in
effect until July 14.
   In the meantime he issued a 60-day stay against all claims
against the defendants.
   Agreement in the case, involving about 2,300 plaintiffs seeking
damages from 230 defendants, was reached Tuesday and approved
Thursday night by District Judge Louis C. Bechtle in Philadelphia.
   The defendants, who filed 264 separate lawsuits, had sought $1.8
billion.
   U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist had appointed
Bechtle to head the negotiations. Bechtle was the presiding judge
in a similar case involving the 1980 MGM Grand Hotel fire in Las
Vegas that killed 84 people. The settlement in that case totaled
$200 million.
   Under the agreement signed in Philadelphia, $50 million will be
paid by the insurer, American International Underwriters Corp., and
$35 million by the Dupont-family group of partnerships and
individuals who owned many hotel enterprises, including the Dupont
Plaza. Other insurance carriers will pay the remaining $15 million.
   In an interview after Friday's hearing, Acosta said the 300-page
agreement calls for the plaintiffs to receive $85 million in what
he described as ``hard money'' and $15 million in ``soft money.''
   He said hard money meant immediately available funds such as
cash, bonds and property. Soft money refers to funds the defendants
said they could raise but could not guarantee.
   The plaintiffs agreed to accept any portion of the $15 million
the defendants could raise.
   The judge said he could not reveal the ``critical conditions''
to be completed over the next 60 days.
   Jorge Ortiz Brunet, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said they
generally dealt with deadlines for the defendants to pay their
share of the settlement.
   The fire on Dec. 31, 1986, killed 97 people and injured more
than 140. It broke out in a ballroom on the first floor of the
22-floor hotel, and most of the victims were trapped in the casino.
The beach hotel was filled on New Year's Eve with nearly 1,000
guests.
   The disaster occurred during bitter labor negotiations between
the Teamsters Union and the hotel management. Three former
employees who were members of the union were accused of setting the
fire and were convicted in 1987 of murder. The union denied any
responsibility.
   The hotel was cited for 25 violations by the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, including lack of emergency exits from
the casino where 84 of the victims periushed.
   In the first phase of the trial, which began March 15, lawyers
for the plaintiffs claimed that Dupont's parent company, Hotel
Systems International, sought a coverup to avoid liability.
   The second phase of the trial deals with hotel suppliers, and
Acosta said those proceedings would begin in 45 days regardless of
whether conditions he set down for ending the first phase were
satisfied.
   The final phase deals with a lawsuit filed by the hotel against
the Puerto Rican chapter of the Teamsters Union.
   The 425-room hotel in San Juan's Condado district has been
renovated but has not reopened.

<HEAD>Computer Programmer Convicted Of 16 Sex-Torture Murders of Young
Men</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Randy Kraft, a computer programmer
accused of leading a double life as a brutalizer and killer of 37
young men in three states, was convicted Friday of 16 murders.
   The jury, after deliberating into a 12th day, also found Kraft
guilty of one count of sodomy and one count of sexual mayhem. He
was acquitted of one sodomy count.
   Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin scheduled
a hearing Tuesday to set a date for a penalty phase of the trial to
decide whether Kraft, 44, should be put to death.
   The case already has taken six years from arrest to verdict,
hampered by a multitude of defense motions, the illness of a judge,
the size of the case and the need for defense attorneys to prepare
for the possible introduction of the 21 other deaths into the
penalty phase.
   Judy Nelson, whose son Geoffrey Nelson, 18, was slain in 1983,
burst into tears after the verdicts were read.
   ``I know he's guilty. He knows he's guilty. Every mother in
there had 16 beautiful sons, and he should pay,'' she said.
   The defendant sighed loudly as the court clerk began reading the
verdicts, then showed no other emotion during the 30-minute
recitation.
   Besides the 12-year span of Orange County slayings for which he
was convicted, authorities have said Kraft is suspected of killing
21 young men in California, Oregon and Michigan.
   Deputy District Attorney Bryan Brown contends that Kraft picked
up hitchhikers, disabled them by plying them with drugs and
alcohol, sexually tortured and mutilated them, and then strangled
them.
   The prosecutor described Kraft, who has an unusually high IQ of
129, as a fetishist who kept some of the dismembered parts of his
victims in his refrigerator freezer.
   Rodger DeVaul Sr., whose son Rodger, 20, was among the victims,
said he was relieved the ordeal of trial had finally ended.
   ``It was six years ago that he was arrested. There's no way it
should take this long to come to a verdict,'' he said. ``There is
no need for the families to suffer this long.''
   Brown would not comment, saying only ``It's tough right now when
we're between these phases.''
   Jurors considered seven months of testimony including evidence
of necrophilia.
   When Kraft was arrested, police said they found 47 color
photographs of young men, many of them nude and apparently dead.
They also found a notebook with more than 60 handwritten notations,
which prosecutors have called a ``death list.''
   Kraft hasn't spoken about the case since a jailhouse interview
in which he denied killing anyone.
   He was arrested when California Highway Patrol officers pulled
him over for erratic driving and discovered a strangled Marine in
the passenger seat.
   Defense attorneys C. Thomas McDonald and James Merwin never
called Kraft to the witness stand. They argued that evidence
against him was inconclusive, and they attempted to raise doubts by
posing a series of questions during closing arguments.
   ``I don't think you'll find a single piece of direct evidence
that Randy killed these people,'' said Merwin.

<HEAD>Official Calls Use of Teacher Homes for Training Disabled Poor Judgment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A school official Friday defended a job-training
program that teaches housekeeping to developmentally disabled
students, but admitted he erred by letting students clean the homes
of teachers and principals.
   The Madison School of the Wyandotte district has 183
developmentally disabled students from 14 Detroit-area school
districts. The students are sent to a number of sites for job
training, and Superintendent Michael Williamson said housekeeping
is part of the training.
   ``The program provides an excellent opportunity for handicapped
youngsters and can afford them some measure of independence,''
Williamson said.
   ``I think there was an error in judgment made in using teachers'
... and principals' homes, because it leaves us open to
exploitation by the public and the press.''
   On Wednesday, the mothers of two of the students, Sandra Adkins
and Laura Murphy, filed suit in Wayne County Circuit Court,
claiming they never gave permission for their disabled children to
be used in ``child slavery.''
   Williamson said the lawsuit was ``outrageous exploitation on the
part of the mothers.''
   The lawsuit asks the court to end housekeeping training unless
the students receive parental permission and are paid minimum wage.
The women allege their daughters had to clean and scrub floors at
the homes of teachers and principals.
   ``They are supposed to be learning for future employability,''
said Richard A. Neaton, the mothers' lawyer. ``I seriously question
whether they need to clean teachers' homes to do that.''
   Adkins and Murphy said they had given permission only for their
children to receive training in a clothing store.
   ``When the parents told us they didn't want their kids to go, we
honored those parents' requests,'' Madison Principal Cheri Kodrich
said. ``The lawsuit came as a total shock. I have nothing to
defend. What we do is legitimate.''
   Williamson and Kodrich said all parents were notified in writing
that their children might work at different sites if another
student missed school. The mothers said they never received such
notice.
   ``I never would have agreed to that,'' said Adkins, whose
15-year-old child is mentally impaired. ``She goes to school to
learn to function as an adult, not to clean the principal's house.''
   The Madison program was defended by Patricia Hauser, executive
director of the Association for Retarded Citizens in Downriver.
   The association has ``found the Wyandotte schools to be
excellent,'' she said.
   Wilma Clark, mother of a 17-year-old boy in the program, said
she always receives written notices of any changes in her son's
training.
   ``Every time, I receive a letter telling where, what the job is
about and how long he'll be there,'' she said.

<HEAD>Bush Calls For International Workshop on Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday said the United
States would hold an international workshop this fall to seek
solutions to global warning as a step toward reaching an eventual
treaty on the problem.
   Environmentalists hailed the move as a step forward in singling
out global warming as a world environmental threat and reaching a
consensus on how best to deal with it. But they questioned whether
the president was moving quickly enough.
   In a statement, Bush said he expects the international workship
the U.S. will host in October will ``lead to international
scientific consensus on the seriousness of the (global warming)
issue'' and to formal negotiations on a treaty to tackle the
problem.
   The meeting will examine a range of financial, economic and
technical issues that might be affected by worldwide curbs on the
release of so-called ``greenhouse'' gases into the atmosphere.
These gases, mainly carbon dioxide and other pollutants associated
with burning fossil fuels, are widely blamed for causing rising
temperatures.
   William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
said the United States and 29 other countries agreed at a United
Nations-sponsored meeting in Geneva on Friday that the workshop
should be the next step in dealing with global warming.
   In a telex to Geneva on Thursday, the White House directed its
delegation to the conference to press for the workshop, saying,
``The scope and importance of this issue are so great that it is
essential for the U.S. to exercise (a) leadership role.''
   The administration has been criticized recently for failing to
take the initiative on international environmental issues. There
reportedly has been internal disagreement on the urgency of the
global warming problem and how aggressively to proceed
diplomatically on the subject.
   One faction, which includes Reilly and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, has sought to move more rapidly toward developing a
treaty. But White House chief of staff John Sununu has expressed
reservations about moving too quickly before all of the economic
and technical issues have been resolved, according to sources.
   The administration's pronouncements brought mixed responses from
environmentalists.
   ``It's a positive move by the president,'' said Rafe Pomeranze
of the World Resource Institute. But he said negotiations on a
treaty likely would not even begin until late 1990 under the
administration's timetable.
   Joseph Goffman of the Environmental Defense Fund said the
president's recognition of the need to press ahead on a treaty is
``forward progress'' but added, ``What we need is for the president
to get out in front on this issue.''
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., a ranking member of the Senate
environment protection subcommittee, said he welcomed the Bush
initiative and didn't feel the president was lagging behind other
world leaders.
   ``It's been clear from the start that he (the president) gives
this issue the highest priority,'' said Reilly, calling the fall
workshop ``a giant step'' toward getting an international consensus.
   Reilly repeatedly has rejected suggestions that the global
warming problem can be dealt with unilaterally. He has said any
progress industrial nations make in reducing pollutants linked to
the warming process could be nullified without cooperation from
Third World nations as they develop their industries.
   Scientists believe that global temperatures could rise by 4
degrees to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century
because increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other manmade gases
in the atmosphere will trap and retain heat from the sun in a
process similar to what happens in a greenhouse.
   Such a warming trend could melt polar ice caps and allow sea
levels to rise, cause severe droughts and storms, and severely
disrupt the earth's biological systems.
   Scientists at a Senate hearing earlier this week indicated the
problem may be developing faster than their computers had
predicted. One government scientist raised a furor when he
disclosed that the administration had changed his testimony to
apparently downplay the urgency of the matter.

   A Cheyenne-Arapaho woman, disabled from polio,
said Friday she can't get welfare as long as she is on federal oil
royalty rolls and since those checks stopped coming regularly she
lost her home and children.
   Mary Limpy choked back tears as she told a special investigating
committee of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs that she
has lived three years in an abandoned house in Oklahoma City
because she could not pay her bills.
   The checks stopped coming regularly in 1983, said Mrs. Limpy,
who said the state took custody of her two youngest children two
years ago.
   Now, the money comes sporadically, and the Bureau of Indian
Affairs which manages her three wells can't say why, she told the
committee.
   ``I do not get my royalty checks right after the gas or oil is
sold,'' she said. ``I get my checks sometimes four to seven months
later. Recently, it has been about four months later.''
   She said the checks average $30 to $60. She told the committee
she would be better off if she did not have the royalties at all
and could apply for state welfare.
   Mrs. Limpy said her wells originally were leased by the Tenneco
Oil Co. which sold the leases to Koch Oil. She said at one point
she heard the wells had been capped, but the farmer who works the
land where the wells are located said trucks kept going on and off
the oilfield.
   Witnesses before the committee earlier in the week testified
that Koch, which is based in Wichita, Kan., had been stealing oil
from Indian wells, a charge the company has denied.
   Mrs. Limpy is part of a federal class-action lawsuit charging
that the government has violated its trust responsibilities to
Indians with oil well interests, said attorney Steve Moore.
   Moore said the suit's plaintiffs include 7,000 allottees with
interest in 944 oil leases in western Oklahoma.
   That lawsuit has been held under advisement by Judge Ralph
Thompson, of the western district of Oklahoma, for 2{ years, said
Moore.
   ``It seems outrageous that a federal judge has refused to act
when you have the obvious need,'' said DeConcini. He suggested that
the judge be investigated for possible negligence or misconduct.
   Thompson had no comment on Mrs. Limpy's testimony conerning
delays in the case.
   However, a statement issued by Bob Dennis, court clerk for the
western district of Oklahoma, said counsel for both sides have
reported to the court that settlement offers have been ongoing
while they watched an ``almost identical'' case pending in New
Mexico.
   The statement said the New Mexico case settled by an entry of
consent decree in March, and that both parties in Mrs. Limpy's case
filed a status report last month that ``specific settlement offers
were forthcoming'' and that the parties would report on their
progress in July.
   The court said they waited on the New Mexico case to avoid a
potential conflict in rulings, to avoid delays in possible appeals
and to ``enhance the prospects of an agreed settlement in the
case.''
   In Oklahoma, Indians have been allotted land by federal
treaties. When that land includes oil property, the federal
government is responsible for making sure the Indians get their
share of the royalties.
   The government supplies an ``explanation of payment'' that is
supposed to help the allottees understand the condition of the well
and why the check is for a certain amount.
   Every witness that appeared before the committee Friday said the
forms are nearly impossible to understand.
   Houston and Velma Decker, a Caddo Indian couple living in
Oklahoma, said they have been trying since March 1988 to find out
why their checks suddenly dropped in amount.
   Neither the BIA nor the Minerals Management Service has given
them an answer, despite repeated inquiries, they said.
   ``I have allottees that come in everyday,'' said Ken Young of a
BIA office in Utah. ``There's no way they can understand (the
forms).''
   He said he thought the government bureaucracy should be
elminated and the oil companies should pay the allottees directly.

   Tass said Friday that Soviet tank and air defense
units will begin withdrawing from Mongolia on Monday, the same day
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev begins a visit to China.
   The news agency said the units will leave the Mongolian railroad
stations of Erdenet and Choir and cross the border at the Soviet
city of Kyakhta.
   Tass quoted Col. Gen. Dmitry Grinkevich, chief of the army
general staff, as saying about 50,000 men, more than 850 tanks and
nearly 1,100 infantry vehicles will be pulled out of Mongolia by
next year. He said the withdrawal also involves more than 820
different artillery systems, 190 planes and 130 helicopters. He did
not say how many Soviet military personnel are in Mongolia.
   Gorbachev announced the withdrawal plan in a speech to the U.N.
General Assembly in New York on Dec. 7. He gave few details, and
Grinkkevich's comments provided the first breakdown of units to be
pulled out.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said on
March 7 that the Soviet Union had begun withdrawing three-fourth of
its troops from Mongolia, including all of its air force units, but
he did not say when the pullout began or how many troops were
involved.
   It was not clear why Tass reported Friday that the withdrawal
would only begin Monday, more than two months after Gerasimov said
it had started.
   Mongolia is between China and the Soviet Union, and China has
said the removal of Soviet troops from the country was a necessary
step to improving relations between the two communist powers.
   Gorbachev's visit to Beijing will be the first Chinse-Soviet
summit in 30 years.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Friday
scheduled the first political tests of his election plan for the
occupied lands. Arab doctors said Israeli troops shot and killed a
24-year-old Palestinian.
   At least 10 other Palestinians were wounded in confrontations
between soldiers and stone-throwers in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, Arab reports said.
   Shamir called meetings for Saturday and Sunday to consider
guidelines for the elections, the first with Cabinet ministers of
his right-wing Likud bloc and the second with the full Cabinet,
including members of the left-leaning Labor Party.
   Shamir's proposal to end the 17-month rebellion in the occupied
lands involves elections to choose Palestinian representatives who
would negotiate with Israel for limited autonomy. Talks would
follow three years later on a permanent settlement.
   When it meets Sunday, the 25-member government likely will
sidestep controversial issues such as the participation of
Palestinians from outside the territories _ a Palestinian demand
reportedly supported by the United States.
   ``What we are bringing are the main principles, the skeleton of
the plan, without getting into details,'' said a Shamir aide, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The meetings come during a weekend visit by U.S. officials who
are expected to press Shamir for specifics such as whether 140,000
Palestinians living in east Jerusalem will be able to vote and
whether there will be international supervision.
   Both Radio Moscow and the Abu Dhabi newspaper Al Ittihad
reported that Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat
will accept the elections if they are held under international
supervision.
   Shamir introduced his idea for elections last month at a meeting
with President Bush following criticism of Israel's handling of the
uprising.
   Since then, Palestinians in the occupied territories and the
PLO, which is outlawed here, have rejected the elections.
   Clashes occur daily. On Friday, five confrontations erupted in
the Gaza Strip and one in the West Bank town of El Bireh, just
north of Jerusalem.
   The worst confrontation was in Gaza City, the seaside strip's
largest town, where troops opened fire on stone-throwing youths,
killing Mahmoud Awad Akraa and wounding six others, Arab hospital
officials said.
   A military spokesman confirmed Akraa's death but said a
preliminary report showed no troops were in the area at the time of
the alleged confrontation.
   He said the army was continuing its investigation into the death.
   The death would raise to at least 472 the number of Palestinians
killed since they started rebelling against Israeli occupation in
December 1987. Twenty-one Israelis also have died.
   The Gaza clashes occurred despite a curfew that confined the
strip's 700,000 residents to their homes for a fifth day.
   In the West Bank town of Nablus, troops shot and wounded two
Palestinians including a 15-year-old.
   In Israel, just north of Gaza, Israelis stoned Arab-owned cars
for a second day to protest the killing of one soldier in the area
and the disappearance of another soldier. Police have blamed
Palestinians.
   The incidents and the murder of two Israelis by a Palestinian in
Jerusalem last week have raised right-wing opposition to Shamir's
election plan.
   Among opponents is Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, who says they
will bring disaster.
   ``The plan will not bring peace, but a PLO Palestinian state,
terror and war, and the re-division of Jerusalem,'' he told Yediot
Ahronot newspaper.
   Most Likud ministers are expected to approve and ministers of
the Labor Party already approved the plan Thursday.
   After Sunday's meeting, Shamir will meet with Dennis Ross, a
senior aide to Secretary of State James Baker III. Ross arrives
Saturday night to brief Israeli leaders on Baker's talks in Moscow
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Ross also is expected to meet Palestinian leaders. He reportedly
is trying to make the election plan more attractive to them by
urging Israel to allow Arabs in east Jerusalem to vote _ a concept
opposed by Shamir but favored by Labor Party leaders.
   East Jerusalem was captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
war and annexed into the Israeli capital.

   A witness in the House ethics committee's
probe of Speaker Jim Wright charged Friday that the panel had
unfairly threatened him for attempting to correct what he saw as a
misleading account of his testimony.
   ``When Mr. Payte attempted to correct the record, you used the
power of your committee to attempt to silence him,'' wrote Preston
M. Geren III, an attorney for Fort Worth real estate developer S.
Gene Payte, in a letter to the ethics panel.
   Payte had testified before the panel last Oct. 17 and told of
his efforts to give money to Wright because he appreciated the
speaker's work in Congress. Wright declined the gift, and Payte
then sought to buy copies of Wright's book, ``Reflections of a
Public Man,'' to show his appreciation.
   According to the report of special ethics committee counsel
Richard J. Phelan, Payte then paid a total of $6,000, intended
partly to help revise and update the book and to pay for 1,000
copies.
   The report states that ``although he was equivocal on the point
in his testimony, Payte testified that he only received between 300
and 500 copies of the `old' book for his $6,000, and would still
like to receive the new books.''
   Apparently based on that testimony, the ethics committee deemed
the money for the undelivered books an improper gift to Wright and
added that to its formal charges against the speaker.
   Payte later disputed the account of his testimony, issuing a
public affidavit last month that contended the reference to 300 to
500 books came in a question from Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana,
the committee's ranking Republican, and that he had said several
times he received all 1,000 books he paid for.
   On Friday, Payte released a copy of a May 5 letter he received
from the ethics panel reminding him of a gag order on committee
witnesses.
   ``Your affidavit represents a course of conduct in direct
violation of the admonition given to you,'' the letter stated.
``Accordingly, we wish to notify you that the matter of your
violation may be taken up by the committee ...''
   Payte ``was very disturbed, and when he got over being
disturbed, was very angry'' at the letter, Geren said. ``He sees it
as an effort by the committee to make him keep quiet, an effort to
bluff him into silence.''
   He said Payte's affidavit addressed only matters that already
were public because they were included in the ethics committee's
published report.
   Committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said the letter ``in
no way'' was intended as a threat, but was a reminder that
witnesses are not to discuss testimony given in private.
   ``If he felt his testimony had been characterized unfairly, the
first people he should talk to is the committee,'' Dixon said,
adding that he was unaware of any effort by Payte to do so.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The independent Electoral Council
said Friday there will not be any election soon because
election-day massacres in 1987 left Haitians with no confidence in
the democratic process.
   No election date has been set, and Haiti's military ruler, Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril, said late last year there would be no elections
for at least two years.
   Several political leaders have called for elections by the end
of this year.
   ``Citizens are not mobilized for elections now. We have to
regain their confidence in the democratic process which was lost
after the aborted elections of Nov. 29,'' 1987, said the Electoral
Council secretary-general, Jean-Gerard Pierre.
   On that date thugs protected by soldiers attacked voters at
polling stations, killing at least 34 people. The elections, which
would have been the first free balloting in Haiti in more than 30
years, were canceled by the ruling council of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Namphy came to power after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to
France in 1986 during uprisings against his regime. Namphy was
ousted last September in a coup by soldiers who accused the
government of state-sponsored violence and demanded a return to
democracy.
   The Electoral Council has nine members appointed by institutions
including the Roman Catholic Church, the news media and human
rights groups.
   ``If elections are held in a hurry they will be a farce. People
do not yet have faith in Avril's will or ability to lead the
country towards democracy,'' said Jean-Claude Roy, technical
adviser to a previous Electoral Council dissolved by Namphy hours
after the election-day killings in 1987.
   Troops loyal to Avril blocked an attempted coup by some military
officers on April 2, and the ringleaders were sent into exile.

   The head of the House investigations
subcommittee said Friday an FDA inspection of a New Jersey drug
manufacturing plant appeared to be an attempt to retaliate against
the firm for testifying against the agency.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., asked the Food and Drug
Administration to explain the Thursday inspection of the Barr
Laboratories' plant, which began about the time Barr executives
were concluding their testimony before Dingell's panel.
   ``The committee is of the tentative view ... that there is an
attempt here to coerce, harass, intimidate or retaliate against the
persons who cooperated in the investigation,'' he said.
   The Pomona, N.Y.-based Barr Laboratories was informed by the FDA
on Thursday night the inspection had been suspended pending an
internal review, according to the company's attorney, H. Lawrence
Fox.
   The head of Mylan Laboratories in Pittsburgh told the
subcommittee at Thursday's hearing the FDA was holding up approvals
on some of the company's products in retaliation for Mylan having
started the investigation into alleged bribery and other corruption
at the agency's generic drug division.
   Mylan's complaints about discriminatory and arbitrary treatment
by the division sparked an inquiry by the House Energy and Commerce
investigations subcommittee a year ago. The panel turned over its
evidence to the U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore, though it is
continuing its investigation.
   Two FDA employees and a drug company executive have been charged
in the case, and more arrests are expected.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said that ``due to the generics
investigation, FDA conducted a retrospective review of generic
products and manufacturing sites to be sure that no product was
released that was unsafe.
   ``We had no idea when this project was started weeks ago that an
inspection of Barr Labs would begin on the same day as the hearing.
As soon as we found out about the inspection, we called it off,''
he said.
   Investigators have said they have found no evidence that any
unsafe or ineffective drugs were put on the market as a result of
the alleged improprieties.
   Dingell said Thursday he would not tolerate reprisals against
any of the companies or individuals cooperating with his panel.
Later the same day, acting FDA Deputy Commissioner James Benson
wrote Dingell assuring him there would be no retaliation. Benson
also sent a memo to division employees warning against ``even the
appearance of retaliatory action.''
   Fox said the company was last inspected nine months ago and that
the FDA had found nothing wrong and the company has had no recalls
since then. In such circumstances, he said, inspections usually
occur at two-year intervals.
   ``It isn't real difficult to look back and see (the last
inspection) wasn't two years ago,'' Fox said.

   Dustin Hoffman and other stars Friday urged the
government to halt a new office project on the remains of a 16th
century theater where Shakespeare once acted.
   In a letter to the newspaper The Independent, Hoffman and 15
actors and directors called for the site of the Rose theater to be
designated an ancient monument to ensure its preservation.
   Without the designation, the recently discovered remains will be
irrevocably damaged by the construction work due to start Monday,
they said. The remains include part of the stage and collapsed
walls of the Elizabethan theater where Shakespeare acted in 1592.
   ``As a last-ditch attempt to save the remains of the Rose
theater from destruction, we appeal to the Secretary of State for
the Environment (Nicholas Ridley) to schedule the site as an
Ancient Monument immediately. After Monday it will be too late.''
   Later Friday, the development company involved said the remains
of the Rose theater would be protected and preserved beneath the
building ``with minimal damage,'' but the Royal Shakespeare Company
said the assurances did not go far enough.
   Several actors said they still intended to go to the site in
protest on Sunday, and that Ian McKellen and Dame Peggy Ashcroft
would read from Shakespeare's ``Henry VI,'' the first play
performed at the Rose.
   Ridley, who opened an office building in Southampton on Friday,
said: ``I haven't decided what to do. When I have decided, I will
make an announcement.''
   In addition to Hoffman, the signatories included Simon Callow,
Dame Judi Dench, James Fox, Peter Hall, and Tim Pigott-Smith.
   Hoffman, winner of this year's best actor Oscar for the film
``Rain Man,'' is in Britain to play Shylock in a stage production
of Shakespeare's ``The Merchant of Venice'' later this month.
   In a letter Friday to The Times of London, Lord Olivier, Dame
Peggy Ashcroft and eight others wrote: ``Plans for the office block
... show the area peppered with concrete piles. One is to be placed
center-stage _ a stage on which (Christopher) Marlowe, Shakespeare
and (Ben) Jonson trod...
   ``Surely the secretary of state (Ridley) should intervene ... to
prevent building from proceeding and to save the entire Rose
theater site for the nation.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thursday told the House of
Commons that ``everything possible'' will be done to preserve the
theater.
   ``There have been very constructive discussions between the
developers, English Heritage (a body that preserves historic sites)
and the Museum of London, with the result that the remains are
going to be preserved with the minimum of damage.''
   Imry Merchant Developers said Thursday: ``The remains are going
to be wrapped as carefully as a porcelain doll. There must be a
building over the top of it and to protect the Rose there has to be
a protective covering for it.''
   But Harvey Sheldon, the archaeologist who led Museum of London
excavations at the site, later said ``parts of the stage walls will
be demolished so that the piles for the new building can be driven
through it.''
   Museum experts located and uncovered the remains of the theater
after an office building was demolished in December.
   American actor-producer Sam Wanamaker has called the Rose the
``20th century's most important discovery regarding the cradle of
the great Elizabethan theater.''
   The museum excavations suggest that the theater, originally
thought to have been octagonal, had 17 or 18 sides or was
elliptical.
   Records show it was demolished not long after Shakespeare acted
there. The chalk foundations lie 6 feet below the modern surface.
   The excavations have unearthed thousands of hazelnut shells _
the Elizabethan equivalent of popcorn _ clay pipes dating from
1580, sheep bones and large numbers of oyster shells.

<HEAD>Authorities Plan Test Of Powerful Chemicals; Vaidogubsky Returns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Exxon and government scientists said
Friday they plan to test-spray an oily island beach with powerful
sludge-thinning chemicals because weeks of scouring have failed to
clean Alaska's oily shores.
   Oil industry executives also announced that they have renewed
the $15,000-a-day contract for the Soviet vessel Vaidogubsky, a
state-of-the-art oil skimmer that will be on standby near the
entrance of Prince William Sound as a backup in case of spills.
   The use of chemical oil thinners, or dispersants, drew immediate
criticism from the environmental group Greenpeace.
   ``It creates more of a hazard than it's worth,'' said Cindy
Lowry, a Greenpeace spokeswoman. ``Right now, it seems a pretty
risky thing to try. There are so many important pupping areas for
harbor seals. This is not the right time to do it. I don't think
they are that controlled, either.''
   Exxon, under the orders of Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins,
is developing a plan to test the dispersants on Ingot Island beach,
a heavily fouled area of Prince William Sound. Scientists hope to
thin the taffylike crude enough to float it away in the current,
then allow it to decompose naturally. In some areas, the oil has
the consistency of asphalt.
   Robbins said other land cleanup methods, including hot- and
cold-water washing of the rocky shores, had proven futile. ``I'm
not hot on dispersants, but I think we've got to look at it,'' said
Robbins, the on-site commander of the oil cleanup.
   Earlier testing of dispersants proved inconclusive shortly after
the oil spill March 24, when the Exxon Valdez tanker slammed into
Bligh Reef and poured about 10.9 million gallons of crude through
its ripped hull.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has scheduled hearings
next week in Anchorage to investigate the cause of the accident.
The fired skipper of the tanker, Joseph Hazelwood, 42, of
Huntington, N.Y., faces trial June 20 in Valdez on charges that
include operating the vessel while intoxicated.
   The 11,400-ton, 450-foot-long Vaidogubsky was involved in the
oil cleanup under a monthlong contract with Exxon. But the ship's
high-tech pumping and dredging equipment frequently jammed on the
hardened crude, or ``mousse,'' formed by buffeting from winds and
waves, and Exxon did not renew the contract.
   But Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the oil industry's jointly
owned company that manages the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, hired the
ship through the end of May as ``standby backup,'' said Alyeska
spokesman Tom Brennan. ``It will be assigned to the tanker waiting
area south of Valdez. When tankers can't come directly into port
because of heavy traffic, they wait out there.''
   He said the vessel ``would provide extra protection'' in case of
another spill.
   Exxon has proposed cleaning some 364 miles of shore inside
Prince William Sound and southwest from Valdez along the Alaska
coast. The company, which has spent about $100 million on the
cleanup to date, said it will have 5,000 beach cleanup workers in
place by midsummer.
   Much of the oil that has reached land has been pounded into the
shore by wave and tide action, Robbins said, and the buried crude
does not dissipate.
   ``The oil trapped in the subsurface is not weathering at all,''
he said.
   The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said the
methods used to clean the beaches to date ``are not efficient at
removing this oil which is trapped in the soil ... or trapped
within the shoreline sediment. More effective methods need to be
used.''
   Legislation creating a state commission to investigate the Exxon
Valdez spill and to increase spill fines to up to $50 a gallon were
signed into law Friday by Gov. Steve Cowper. He also signed a bill
that imposes stricter liability laws on companies responsible for
ol and hazardous material spills.
   The ``spill bills'' were the first to become law since the Exxon
Valdez ran aground.
   ``These new laws are a first step in making sure another Exxon
Valdez incident never happens,'' Cowper said in a news release.
``They also send a signal to the oil industry that it's going to
have to improve its performance or face some serious consequences.''

   Under U.S. prodding, the World Health Organization
on Friday shelved until next year a decision on whether to admit
the PLO's self-declared state of Palestine as its 167th member.
   The State Department in Washington hailed the action, saying the
organization ``rejected the PLO's efforts to politicize WHO's
important work.''
   The vote dashed PLO hopes of winning voting rights in all major
U.N. agencies this year after its legislature in Tunis, the capital
of Tunisia, last November proclaimed the ``State of Palestine.''
   The WHO annual assembly voted 83-47 in a secret ballot in favor
of a resolution co-sponsored by nine Western and Third World
countries. It coupled the deferral with a call for more aid to
residents of Israeli-occupied lands, where a Palestinian uprising
began 17 months ago. Twenty members abstained.
   The Soviet Union joined in supporting the resolution. Soviet
Health Minister E.I. Chazov told the assembly earlier that Moscow
wanted to find a ``solution avoiding confrontation .''
   Dr. Fathi Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization
observer delegation and the physician brother of PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat, said the resolution means ``you will all stand
behind us next year. You will all vote so that we may assume our
role of peace in all the international organizations.''
   Earlier, the meeting refused to consider Nicaraguan amendments
that would have effectively turned the proposal into a call for the
PLO's immediate admission.
   The voting followed more than four hours of procedural wrangling.
   Nearly 100 countries have recognized the state of Palestine or
at least acknowledged its proclamation.
   Israel objected to Friday's resolution. In an official statement
released in Jerusalem moments after the vote, the Foreign Ministry
said deferring the decision to admit the PLO ``poses an obstacle to
peace in our region.''
   ``There is no place for this terrorist organization among the
members of this humanitarian organization,'' it said.
   The United States, which is contributing $74 million _ or 25
percent _ to the WHO's regular budget in 1989, threatened to
withdraw all payments to any U.N. agency admitting the PLO as a
full member.
   Thirty-eight senators led by Robert W. Kasten Jr, R-Wis., wrote
a letter last month to Secretary of States James A. Baker III,
vowing they would seek such cuts in U.S. contributions.
   In Washington, Kasten hailed Friday's vote as ``a very
significant defeat for the PLO. ... More importantly, it shows what
we can accomplish with a unified and bipartisan approach to foreign
policy with the executive and legislative branches working hand in
hand.''
   Baker, joined by all Western nations, argued that the
self-proclaimed new entity did not fullfill internationally
accepted criteria of statehood, including control of a defined
territory.
   He said PLO admission would harm the Middle East peace process
and the entire U.N. system.
   The State Department issued a statement saying the Bush
administration ``reaffirms U.S. support for the WHO'' and its
global health-improvement programs, while adding that Washington
also will continue to oppose any change in the non-voting observer
status of the PLO in the WHO or any other U.N. bodies.
   All 21 Arab countries backed the PLO's application.
   WHO Director General Hiroshi Nakajima, a Japanese physician, had
pleaded in vain with Yasser Araft to withdraw his application for
membership or at least put it off until the next assembly. Nakajima
said a cutoff of U.S. funds would ``completely destroy'' the agency.
   Hours before the debate started, the PLO said it would help
finance the WHO's African operations in case of a withdrawal of
U.S. funds. It said it raised the money from Arab countries.
   Nakajima told the assembly again that WHO's survival was at
stake.
   ``Let us do nothing that would jeopardize the future of our
organization,'' he told the more than 1,000 delegates crowding the
assembly hall of the Palais des Nations, the U.N. Office in Geneva.
   The World Health Organization, a specialized U.N. agency, began
operating in 1948 with its declared purpose to aid in ``the
attainment by all peoples of the highest possible levels of
health.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III failed
Friday to heal a rift with West Germany over nuclear missiles,
leaving a shadow over the May 29-30 summit President Bush will
attend with other Western leaders.
   ``If we had bridged the gap I would tell you,'' Baker said after
he met with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. He
said the security of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could
be at risk if the allies let their nuclear defenses down.
   Meanwhile, officials of the 15 other NATO nations welcomed in
guarded terms Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal to
unilaterally cut 500 short-range nuclear weapons. Baker said it was
merely a Soviet public relations ploy and Bush's national security
adviser said it was designed to split NATO.
   Brent Scowcroft, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One as
Bush flew to Texas for a speech, said the Soviet proposal ``is
designed principally to create problems within the alliance ...
divisions within the Western alliance.''
   The NATO officials, in a statement after Baker briefed them on
his trip earlier this week to Moscow, said, ``We consider reduction
in 500 weapons alone as a welcome, positive, but rather modest
step,'' The statement said NATO looks to Moscow for further
``reductions in its unwarranted superiority.''
   The Bush administration's dispute with West Germany is over
short-range nuclear missiles targeted against the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact countries, mostly from sites on West German soil. West Germany
wants to delay a proposal to triple the range of the missiles and
to increase their speed, asking instead that the United States
begin to negotiate short-range missile cutbacks on both sides with
the Soviet Union.
   The dispute has opened fissures within the alliance. A majority
supports West Germany in a position that Baker suggested was
partially motivated by politics.
   Disarmament feeling is strong in West Germany, and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's decision to oppose modernizing the Lance missiles and
to urge negotiations is viewed as a way of trying to improve his
chances for re-election next year.
   Gorbachev complicated Baker's task with an announcement Thursday
that the Soviets would withdraw 500 nuclear missiles, bombs and
artillery shells from Eastern Europe this year.
   He alo advised Baker in a 3{-hour Kremlin meeting that the
Warsaw Pact would propose at East-West talks in Vienna wide-ranging
cutbacks in troops, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces.
   Baker said the unilateral withdrawal of about 5 percent of the
Soviet short-range nuclear arsenal was ``quite apparently designed
for public opinion'' and included no guarantee the missiles would
be destroyed.
   He said the pullout would have only a modest impact on the
East's edge in nuclear weapons in Europe and that he did not intend
to ``play a public relations game'' with Gorbachev.
   The allies should approach arms reduction moves ``with prudence
and realism,'' Baker said.
   He said that while U.S. differences with West Germany posed
political problems, ``what would be a worse disaster is if we let
domestic politics endanger the security of the alliance.''
   After their discussion, Genscher said that while the Lance
modernization issue was no closer to agreement, ``it was not the
aim of this meeting to make progress.''
   Baker said that after a ``full exchange'' on the issue, he hoped
Genscher ``better understands our position.'' He said he was still
hopeful for a settlement before the NATO meeting in two weeks.
   He also met Friday with Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den
Broek, whose country is one of several NATO members trying to
mediate in the modernization debate.
   The Dutch official said he had ``good hope'' the issue will be
resolved and didn't think Gorbachev's proposal ``will have a direct
influence.''
   NATO estimates the Soviet Union has 1,450 short-range nuclear
missile launchers in Europe, against 88 for the Western alliance.
That imbalance _ as well as a Warsaw Pact superiority in
conventional weapons _ is a main reason the United States and
Britain reject talks on battlefield nuclear arms.
   West Germany and other allies want to put off modernization of
the Lance missiles until the early 1990s and to begin reduction
talks on the battlefied weapons quickly. They argue the East-West
climate has improved enough in recent years to bring such talks to
a positive conclusion.
   Though officials of the NATO countries don't want the dispute to
mar the summit, ostensibly designed to celebrate NATO's 40th
birthday, Baker gave no indication the United States would give in
just to clear the air.
   ``It is a very, very important issue, involving as it does
questions of alliance security,'' he said.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, in Perth, Scotland,
for a Conservative Party conference, supported the U.S. position.
   He said the 500 warheads represent only ``a small proportion''
of the Soviets' stockpile and Gorbachev's action did not undermine
the case for modernizing NATO's short-range missile system.
   Howe was asked if he thought Gorbachev was trying to split NATO
and he replied, ``I think it's characteristic of Mr. Gorbachev's
... position that he always tries to remove one of his many veils
of armor before a NATO meeting.''
   But he added, ``I think there is serious arms control business
to be done and we welcome his response to our longstanding
positions.''

   A jury found Friday that Goddard College
discriminated against a black woman by barring her from a
conference on racism.
   The jury awarded Patricia Lewis $102,000 in damages.
   ``I think the fact that it was an all-white jury didn't
matter,'' said Neil Mickenberg, one of Lewis' attorneys. ``We
proved our case.''
   Lewis, 27, sued the college alleging she was barred from a
three-session workshop on racism, which was targeted at white
women. She said the incident caused her such turmoil as a student
that she had to leave school and has been unable to return.
   ``What we have here is a much more modern form of racial
discrimination that doesn't break your bones, doesn't leave
scars,'' said Frank Kochman, an attorney for Lewis, during Friday's
closing arguments. ``All it does is enter your mind and eat up your
soul.''
   The lawsuit sought $175,000 in damages for her lost wages as a
teacher, which was her initial career goal, and for emotional
distress.
   ``I left Goddard College because I was discriminated against,''
Lewis testified Thursday.
   But a lawyer for Goddard, Charles Hurt, contended in closing
arguments Friday that the case was not related to racial
discrimination, and that Lewis left school for reasons other than
the conference.
   ``It's hard to believe that that would be enough to drop out of
school and interrupt her career that was so important to her,''
Hurt said, suggesting that while Lewis may have been upset, it
didn't make her leave school.
   Hurt could not be reached for comment immediately following the
verdict.
   Goddard, a small, private alternative school in Plainfield,
works hard to educate its students against racism, which was one
reason for the conference, he said.
   During the four-day trial, jurors heard from faculty and staff
at the college, as well as Lewis' psychologist and other experts
who testified about the feelings and experiences of black students
on predominately white campuses. When the incident occurred in
1984, Lewis was one of three black students at Goddard. Fewer than
1,500 blacks live in Vermont.
   Kochman also argued that Goddard had admitted discrimination in
various letters after the incident and in its original response to
the lawsuit.
   ``What are they apologizing for if they didn't do anything
wrong? Nobody does that,'' Kochman said, urging jurors to review
letters from college President Jack Lindquist and others involved.
   In his instructions, Judge Matthew Katz said jurors must first
determine whether Lewis was excluded from the conference, and
second whether that caused her harm.
   Nicola Morris, the Goddard faculty adviser running the
conference ``Moon Over Vermont,'' testified during the trial that
Lewis expressed concern at the time that the group was ``somehow
being Ku Klux Klan.''
   Morris also said that she initially invited the sophomore to
participate in either the workshops or the planning. ``It is
absolutely clear in my mind that she did not want to be included in
the anti-racism conference,'' she said.
   But Lewis testified, ``(Morris) never invited me to the
conference.'' She said Morris asked her to leave when she had
confronted members attending the final workshop.

   A woman's body was found after a
newspaper received a letter in which her husband allegedly
confessed to killing her because she didn't understand his
premonitions and said he left a list of 54 people who ``will be
punished.''
   ``Last Friday night I shot and killed my wife,'' began the
five-page letter, allegedly from David Schoenecker, 48, that was
received Thursday by Orange County Register columnist Bob Emmers.
   Schoenecker was arrested by a Montana sheriff Friday afternoon,
wandering in the Clearwater National Forest just inside the Idaho
border. He was carrying a .357-caliber Magnum revolver but did not
resist, authorities said.
   ``There was no hatred _ I loved her _ but the action was
necessary because I have a purpose and one that cannot have an
interruption or interference,'' the letter said.
   ``Gail reasoned only in black and white or good and bad. She
never dealt in the grey or devious world. A world where I now
totally exist,'' it said.
   The letter, dated Monday and handwritten on stationery from a
Missoula, Mont., Travelodge, said there was a possibility that the
body of Gail M. Schoenecker, 40, had not been discovered. The
writer included the couple's address and advised Emmers to contact
authorities.
   ``I never got anything like it before. It gave me the chills,''
Emmers said.
   Police Sgt. Chet Barry said Friday that police had confirmed
that the body they found Thursday afternoon in the Schoenecker's
home was that of Mrs. Schoenecker, an elementary school teacher.
The cause of death had not been determined, he said.
   Schoenecker had been seen Sunday when he checked into the
Travelodge and apparently spent the night. His car was found
abandoned Tuesday in the Lolo National Forest, about 60 miles west
of Missoula, and cabins in the area were searched, Mineral County
Sheriff Wade Van Gilder said.
   Van Gilder flew by helicopter over the rugged Bitterroot
Mountains to drop ahead of Schoenecker in the Clearwater forest,
then walked back to meet him, said Montana Highway Patrol officer
Rick Seemann.
   Schoenecker had followed a natural course from the Cedar Creek
drainage where he left his car, into another drainage and then over
Hoodoo Pass into Idaho, Seemann said. ``He wasn't sure where he was
headed,'' Seemann said.
   The area has many homes and mining claims and is served by a
well-traveled road, so Schoenecker had been reported several times
on his trek, Seemann said.
   Mineral County deputies were notified Friday by Anaheim police
that Schoenecker bought camping gear in Missoula, probably on
Monday, a sheriff's spokesman said.
   Investigators didn't know exactly what he bought, or where, or
whether he has outdoor skills. Anaheim police would not say how
they learned of the purchase.
   The letter said Schoenecker killed his wife because she didn't
understand the premonitions and ``images'' he had about people who
had ``done wrong or evil'' against him.
   ``Several times I tried to explain these `happenings' to Gail
(my wife) but she dismissed them. I was never understood. I knew
that as these feelings and `pictures' continued to occur and repeat
that I had to prepare a way, develope a plan, make arrangements.
And I have done so.
   ``Now, I had to eliminate my wife. She wouldn't believe me. She
wouldn't even listen. So in order to keep her from finding out, I
developed a separate plan or storyline that totally misled her, but
it did make her happy. She was very happy on Friday.
   ``Gail suspected that we were missing a great deal of money. She
also was upset about several of my trips. Recently she started to
figure that I must be doing something else with my time and our
money.''
   The letter suggested that the chemical engineer may intend to
kill other people.
   ``I've left a list _ a partial list. Not everyone on the list
will receive total punishment _ but they will be punished,'' the
letter said. ``The images in my mind shows me exactly how and when
and where the punishment will be delivered. It has to be done.''
   Police searched the couple's home and found a list of 54 people,
the majority of whom live in the Milwaukee area.
   Anaheim police had contacted about 75 percent of the people
named on the list, Barry said. Several of those listed had gone to
Custer High School in Milwaukee with Schoenecker, Lt. Marc Hedgpeth
said. His wife also was from Milwaukee.
   Schoenecker's ex-wife, Kathy Schoenecker, was on the list; they
were divorced in 1977. Her current husband said by telephone from
Milwaukee that his wife was shaken. She and Schoenecker had two
daughters. Police said Friday they didn't know the whereabouts of
the women, Terry, 20, and Tracy, 22.
   ``He is absolutely not a violent person,'' the former Mrs.
Schoenecker said in a brief telephone interview with The Milwaukee
Journal, which did not give her present last name.
   Schoenecker was senior class president of Custer High School and
the 1959 yearbook recounts a 55-yard touchdown run he made in a key
football game.
   Milwaukee police Detective Jim Gauger said Friday a picture of
Schoenecker had been distributed to all police stations in the
city, and officers have been notified to pay attention to residents
on the list.
   Police in suburban Wauwatosa, Wis., began surveillance Thursday
night on the residences of two people on list, said Lt. Greg
Nauman. ``Neither could understand why they were on the list.''

   Country music singer Ricky Skaggs
tearfully eulogized fellow performer Keith Whitley on Friday by
imploring those with personal problems to seek help.
   Whitley, 33, one of country music's most promising entertainers,
was found dead of an accidental alcohol overdose Tuesday at his
suburban home.
   Skaggs, who played in Kentucky bluegrass bands with Whitley when
both were teen-agers, fought back tears as he eulogized his
longtime friend before more than 500 mourners.
   ``If any of you have a drinking problem or a drug problem or an
emotional problem, please go get help,'' Skaggs told those who
packed in St. Joseph Church.
   ``There's one person who can help: Jesus,'' Skaggs said. ``Keith
would say the same thing.
   ``I've lost so many friends,'' he added.
   Skaggs also sang a 10-minute medley of Whitley's favorite
gospel-bluegrass songs, including ``White Dove,'' ``The Fields Have
Turned Brown'' and ``Drifting Too Far From the Shore.''
   ``It's not easy for me to stand here and talk about my friend,''
he said as many in the church wept audibly. ``I love him so much.
   ``We loved music and we loved our families and we loved each
other.
   ``God is so good. This (funeral) is not about death but about
life.''
   Among those at the funeral were Duane Allen of the Oak Ridge
Boys, Jack Greene, Billy Walker and Vic Willis of the Grand Ole
Opry and country music performers John Hartford, Paul Overstreet
and David Frizzell.
   Some mourners arrived an hour before the 50-minute service.
Those who came late were forced to sit in a side room adjoining the
sanctuary.
   The Rev. Pat Kibby of St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church talked
about Whitley's recent No. 1 hit record, ``I'm No Stranger to the
Rain.''
   ``None of us are strangers to the rain,'' he said about life's
setbacks. ``We get tossed and shoved about by things we can not
control.''
   He encouraged the mourners not to regard Whitley as gone.
   ``He is not dead; his life hasn't ended, only changed. He now
lives an eternal life.''
   An autopsy performed the day Whitley died showed his body
contained a blood alcohol level of 0.47. A 0.30 level is considered
lethal.
   Traces of cocaine and a tranquilizer also were found in his
body, but death was attributed to the alcohol.
   Whitley, a native of Sandy Hook, Ky., had three No. 1 records
during the past eight months: ``I'm No Stranger to the Rain,''
``Don't Close Your Eyes'' and ``When You Say Nothing at All.''
   His widow, Lorrie Morgan, is a regular country music singer on
the Grand Ole Opry. She is scheduled to perform on the live country
music show Saturday night.

<HEAD>Former U.N. Ambassadors Say U.S.-Noriega Dispute Is One for OAS</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The dispute between the United States and
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega should be settled
through the Organization of American States, four former U.S.
ambassadors to the United Nations agreed Friday.
   Going to the OAS ``would allow an opportunity for countries of
the hemisphere to react,'' said Donald McHenry, who served in the
United Nations under former President Carter. ``This is the same
course the U.S. followed in persuading (former dictator) Anastasio
Somoza to leave Nicaragua.''
   ``A U.N. role at this point would only confuse and complicate
the situation,'' agreed John Scali, who served in the world
organization under former President Nixon.
   The two were joined by Andrew Young, who also was U.N.
ambassador under Carter, and Arthur Goldberg, who was Lyndon
Johnson's U.N. envoy. The four held a news conference prior to
taping of a panel discussion on the United Nations for the Southern
Center for International Studies.
   President Bush announced Thursday that he was sending nearly
2,000 additional combat troops into Panama to protect American
citizens from the violence that erupted in the aftermath of
Noriega's decision Wednesday to annul the results of Panama's
presidential election.
   Scali rated Bush's handling of the Panamanian situation a 9 out
of 10, adding, ``I think Mr. Bush is far more cautious (than
President Reagan) and far more conscious of the need to bring
Congress along with him as an ally.''
   ``He's doing a fairly good job,'' said Goldberg, but he added,
``I don't know why we are sending about 2,000 more troops there. We
have about 10,000 there.''
   There must be ``diplomatic efforts to join in condemning this
horrible business that Noriega has entered into. He ought to be
condemned by the international community, beginning with the Latin
American states,'' Goldberg said.
   Scali called the sending of additional troops ``a message, a
signal to the Panamanian people they are not alone'' against what
he called the ``savage brutality'' of the Noriega leadership.
   Settling the dispute ``is the very thing OAS is best expected to
do,'' said Young, who is now Atlanta's mayor. ``It's better that
whatever suggestions are made come from the Latin Americans
themselves and the United States not be the one to come up with THE
plan.''
   McHenry said he believes there is no danger to Americans living
in Panama and troops sent there will not find themselves in combat
with Panamanian defense forces.

<HEAD>Acidic Lakes Concentrated In Southwestern Adirondacks, Study Finds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a quarter of the lakes studied in
upstate New York's Adirondack Mountains are so acidic that they
contain no or very few fish, concludes a study on the effects of
acid rain that was released Friday.
   Shallow lakes in the southwestern Adirondacks are the most
susceptible to high acidity, according to the study by the
Adirondack Lakes Survey Corp., a company formed by utilities and
state environmental officials.
   The survey of 1,723 lakes, mostly in the Adirondacks, is the
most comprehensive work ever done by a state to examine the effects
of acid rain, said James Mahoney, director of the federal Acid
Precipitation Assessment Program, which hopes to finish a 10-year
study on acid rain next year.
   ``This whole acid rain phenomenon is so complicated that it's a
great help when you see a big mess of data that confirms your
natural speculations,'' Mahoney said.
   Much of the contamination of New York state lakes can be traced
to sulfur dioxide emitted from factories in the Midwest and borne
by prevailing wind to the north and east, said Charles Driscoll, a
civil engineering professor at Syracuse University.
   But since many lakes in the Adirondacks are naturally acidic,
it's premature to conclude that the blame for all the damage can be
traced to Midwest factories, Driscoll said.
   Of the 1,469 lakes surveyed in the Adirondacks, investigators
found no fish in 346 and fewer than 10 fish in 79. That's 29
percent of the total.
   The survey found that 352, or 24 percent, of the Adirondack
lakes studied had pH levels of 5 or below. The pH level is a
measurement of acidity. Anything below 5 is considered unlikely to
support life.
   But in the southwestern Adirondacks, 40 percent of the lakes
have pH levels of 5 or below. The survey found more than 60 percent
of the lakes with no fish in upstate New York are in this region.
   ``If you look at these lakes _ the ones that are acidic _ they
are very small lakes _ very shallow lakes,'' Driscoll said.
   Environmentalists had some good news. The survey examined 254
lakes in New York's lower Hudson River Valley and Catskill
Mountains, south of the Adirondacks, and found only 3 percent with
pH levels of 5 or below.
   ``Generally, the conditions there are excellent,'' said Walter
Kretser, project manager of the survey.
   And a related continuing study of 17 Adirondack lakes that's
been underway since 1982 shows that the level of sulfur dioxide in
the air has been declining, consistent with national air pollution
trends. But Driscoll said these improvements have yet to be
reflected in the lakes.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Hit The Plains, Flooding in Maine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms stretched across the Great Plains on
Friday, while heavy rains washed out roads and forced school
closures in Maine where residents braced for flooding along major
rivers.
   Record low temperatures, meanwhile, occurred Friday morning from
Missouri to Florida.
   Southerly winds spread showers and thunderstorms from eastern
portions of Texas and Oklahoma across central Kansas and central
Nebraska to portions of South Dakota and Wyoming.
   In Oklahoma, overnight rainfall from 1{ inches to 2 inches was
reported at Hobart and Fort Sill. Thunderstorms produced half-inch
hail at Laramie, Wyo., at midday.
   A low pressure system centered over New York and Pennsylvania
caused scattered areas of rain to fall from the upper Ohio Valley
and lower Michigan into New England.
   Heavy rainfall continued to plague Maine. Twenty-four hour
rainfall as of 2 p.m. EDT included about four inches at Portland
and Rumford.
   Some roads have been washed out in southwest Maine, where the
Presumpscot River was expected to reach all-time record levels. The
swift river was 2{ feet above flood stage Friday morning and rising
rapidly.
   A flood warning was also posted for the Kennebec, Androscoggin
and Saco rivers. Most major rivers were expected to crest between 6
a.m. and 3 p.m. Saturday.
   Schools in several areas were closed for the day and some
classes were dismissed early because of the worsening road
conditions.
   A low pressure system over Utah caused inclement weather in
parts of the West, with snow falling in central and western
Montana, the Yellowstone area of Wyoming and southeast Idaho. Four
inches of snow fell at Red Lodge, Mont.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at Lewistown, Mont., to 90 degrees at Miami, Fla.
   Miami had a record high temperature on Thursday and a record low
of 65 Friday morning. In the afternoon, the temperature climbed
back up to 91 degrees and surpassed the high mark of 90 degrees set
for May 12 in 1985.
   Other record Florida lows were in Fort Lauderdale (60 degrees;
61 in 1953); Hollywood (55 degrees; 65 in 1963); Miami Beach (65
degrees; 65 in 1944). Also registering record lows for the date
were Montgomery, Ala. (43 degrees; 45 in 1952); and Kansas City,
Mo. (40 degrees; 41 in 1979).
   Saturday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms across
much of the Great Plains and into portions of Missouri, Arkansas
and Louisiana; widely scattered showers and thunderstorms from the
northern and central Rockies into portions of the intermountain
region; and showers from the Great Lakes region and upper Ohio
Valley across the northern and central Appalachians to the northern
and middle Atlantic Coast. Showers will be most numerous over New
England, and from the eastern Great Lakes to the central
Appalachians.
   High temperatures were expected in the 50s in portions of the
intermountain region, across much of Montana and Wyoming, the
central Appalachians and in portions of Maine; in the 80s from the
desert Southwest across most of Texas and the Gulf Coast region to
Florida; and in the 60s and 70s elsewhere.

<HEAD>EPA Proposes Contract Sanctions Against Two Missouri Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency proposed
Friday to bar two Missouri plants of a defense contractor from
receiving any future federal funds because of alleged water
pollution violations.
   The EPA said its move is part of a crackdown on industrial
polluters. It was the first time the agency has started an
enforcement action under the Clean Water Act to cut off federal
funds to government contractors for allegedly failing to comply
with pollution standards.
   Targeted were two Joplin, Mo., plants of Eagle-Picher Industries
Inc., an Ohio-based company that makes batteries for defense,
aerospace and automotive industries.
   The EPA alleges that the plants have discharged untreated waste
water into a creek and dumped toxic wastes, including mercury,
cadmium and chromium, into the city's sewer system in excess of
federal limits.
   The agency filed a lawsuit in federal court in Missouri against
the plants in October 1987 alleging the water pollution violations.
   Company officials in Joplin and at the Cincinnati, Ohio, office
of Eagle-Picher would not comment on EPA's proposed action or
whether the company will seek a hearing to contest it.
   If EPA implements the sanction, it would not invalidate existing
government contracts of the two plants or halt the flow of money
under them, according to Dave Ryan, an EPA spokesman.
   However, those contracts could not be renewed, and the two
plants would be barred from receiving any future federal money.

<HEAD>Army Disbands Civil Defense Unit Amid Death-Squad Concern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army announced the
disbanding Friday of a civil defense unit organized by rightists in
two wealthy neighborhoods. President Jose Napoleon Duarte had
expressed fear the organization could produce death squads.
   Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova, the minister of defense, announced
the dissolution of the 40-man group that he said had been formed in
the capital ``with completely good intentions.''
   Members of the unit took a loyalty oath last week and were given
some military instructions at the downtown headquarters of the 1st
Army Brigade.
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, head of the joint chiefs of staff, told
reporters Thursday the group would be under army supervision and
deal primarily with ``intelligence work.''
   The unit was disbanded ``because of the misunderstanding of its
function on the part of government authorities and the church,''
Vides said during a ceremony dedicating a new military hospital.
   Duarte said Thursday that ``to see these people, who talk about
killing, in uniform and with rifles, this could generate structures
of death squads. The whole country should be worried about this
kind of thing.''
   Human rights organizations blame military-linked rightist death
squads for thousands of abductions and killings of suspected
leftists during the early 1980s.
   Most of the estimated 70,000 people who have been killed in El
Salvador's nine-year war between government forces and left-wing
guerrillas were civilians.

   The United States on Friday told a U.N.-sponsored
meeting of experts dealing with climate changes that Washington now
backed negotiations on a treaty to check the greenhouse effect, a
U.N. official reported.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States announced it wanted to play a leading part in shaping
a coordinated strategy to combat global warming, caused by solar
heat trapped under gases in the atmosphere.
   He said Washington now strongly backs U.N. initiatives designed
to lead to an international convention. Previously, according to
the official, the United States had been not among the major
supporters.
   The meeting in Geneva concluded Friday. It was held under the
auspices of the U.N. Environment Program and the World
Meteorological Organization as part of an 18 month-study of
climatic changes. The experts will publish their recommendations
next year.
   Scientists fear global temperatures could rise by four to nine
degrees by the year 2050. Such a warming trend could melt polar ice
caps and cause sea levels to rise, cause devere droughts and storms
and disrupt the Earth's biological systems.
   Scientists will consider the results of Friday's working group
at a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in
Nairobi, Kenya, next month.

<HEAD>Ceausescu Attacks Communist Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania on
Friday strongly attacked reforms in the Soviet bloc and made plain
he did not intend to adopt similar policies, a report from the
state news agency Agerpres said.
   The report, monitored in Vienna, indicated that Ceausescu did
not name the Soviet Union, Hungary or Poland as countries adopting
far-reaching reforms of the Stalinist system.
   But Agerpres quoted the leader of communist Romania as telling
Communist Party members Friday in Drobeta-Turnu Severin, on the
Yugoslav border:
   ``I would like to tell some circles abroad which try to minimize
the realities of socialism ... that Romania through everything it
has achieved proves there can be no way back, that in no way can
the wonderful industrial, agricultural, social constructions be
privatized, to resort to a set phrase very much used today which
actually means a return to capitalism.
   ``For Romania, capitalism fell forever. There is only one way _
to advance on the revolutionary path of the Communist Party toward
socialism, toward communism.
   ``The building of communism cannot be achieved through
reformism, but through revolutionary fight.''
   The ruling Communist parties have adopted reforms in the Soviet
Union, Poland and Hungary that grant the private economy some role
in the overall national economy.
   Bulgaria also has gone some way to reform its centrally planned
economy.
   But in Romania, East Germany and Czechoslovakia, the Communist
leaderships have either rejected the need for change or adopted
cautious economic reforms.
   Ceausescu is to visit Czechoslovakia within days, according to
Prague's state-run media. His visit follows closely a trip to
Prague by East German leader Erich Honecker that ended with
declarations of unity on both sides.
   Elsewhere in his speech, Ceausescu was quoted as saying he
advocates a speedy reduction of short-range nuclear weapons in
Europe and wants talks for complete abolition of such weapons.
   The West German news magazine Der Spiegel said this week that
Romania now has the ability to make medium-range nuclear rockets
through the sale of Western missile launcher technology.
   Ceausescu said last month that Romania can make nuclear arms but
has not done so out of concern for world peace.
   Some Western analysts doubt the claim since Romania is still
apparently unable to complete its first nuclear power plant at
Cernavoda on the Danube River. Most technology for the plant was
imported from the West.

<HEAD>Parliament Closed Before Committee Issues Scandal Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou on Friday
decreed the end of Parliament's session, stifling a committee's
report on the multimillion-dollar scandal that has shaken his
Socialist government.
   Papandreou and President Christos Sartzetakis signed the order
terminating the current Parliament's final legislative session.
   The 300-member, single-chamber Parliament had been scheduled to
meet through May, closing 16 days before the June 18 general
elections.
   The closing was proposed earlier this week by the conservative
New Democracy Party, the main opposition party, which noted most
deputies were out campaigning and wouldn't attend the sessions.
   But the party leader, Constantine Mitsotakis, had asked that
Parliament reconvene on May 18 when the committee was to submit a
report on the scandal involving fugitive banker George Koskotas.
   Under the closure order Parliament cannot be reconvened.
   ``We have to decide that with the closure of Parliament our
committee ceases to function, since whatever action we take has no
substance,'' said Dimitris Pagoropoulos, chairman of the 30-member
panel. He is a member of Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Movement, which dominated the committee.
   New Democracy Deputy Dyonisios Bouloukos, a committee member,
said the legislature was closed ``to avoid the drafting and
submission of the report to Parliament.''
   The government said it ended the session in response to the
conservatives' request.
   The investigative committee was set up in November when Koskotas
fled Greece after being indicted in a $200 million fraud, forgery
and embezzlement scandal.
   He was arrested in the United States and is jailed in Salem,
Mass., awaiting an extradition hearing.
   In interviews at the jail, Koskotas claimed Papandreou and other
officials in his party received millions of dollars in payoffs and
authorized the looting of the Bank of Crete while Koskotas was its
chairman.
   Many people mentioned by Koskotas had been questioned by the
committee.
   In another development, a man accused of receiving money stolen
from the Bank of Crete was released on bail Friday for health
reasons, according to a court official.
   He said George Louvaris, a close friend of Papandreou, submitted
bail of $330,000. He was released on the conditions he not leave
the country and that he report to a police station every 10 days.
   Louvaris was jailed April 12 and is awaiting trial. Shorty after
his imprisonment he was transferred to an Athens hospital for
treatment of multiple sclerosis.
   A district attorney filed charges against Louvaris in February
after three of Koskotas' former bodyguards testified that they had
delivered boxes of money to Louvaris at his Athens home.
   Koskotas, in interviews in the United States, claimed Louvaris
was a middleman for payoffs to Socialist officials.
   Louvaris and Papandreou have denied any involvement in the bank
scandal.

   The Marines landed first
and the Army followed Friday when the United States beefed up its
forces here to show its displeasure with the regime of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   There was no official reaction from Noriega, whom the U. S.
government and international obervers accused of annulling the
presidential election rather than let the opposition win.
   Fifty Marines of the 2nd Light Armored Infantry Company from
Camp Lejeune, N.C., with their eight-wheel armored vehicles, were
the first to touch down at this base on the outskirts of Panama
City.
   They were followed by planeloads of Army soldiers from the 7th
Infantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif., and the U.S. Army 5th
Infantry Division at Fort Polk, La.
   Seventy-one planes with nearly 1,900 men and their equipment
were expected to land over a 30-hour period.
   The first planes were a few minutes late, and an officer on the
tarmac remarked that MAC, the Military Airlift Command, also means
``Maybe Airplane Come.''
   The C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy jets started landing at
Howard shortly after 1 p.m. on a typical humid, sunny Panamanian
afternoon. The Marines came through a side door, and their
ammunition and other equipment rolled off the planes' rear doors in
large boxes.
   The Marines picked up their gear and, rifles slung, marched
inside to be assigned to what were described as ``field areas
throughout the military installations.''
   ``Most of them will be living in tents,'' a Southern Command
spokesman said.
   Some Marines smiled at journalists and waved. ``Glad to be
here,'' a sergeant said as he went by. ``It was a rough flight.''
   Col. Dave Hale, a burly man with a camouflaged face, read a
brief statement to newsmen.
   ``We are proud to be here,'' he read. ``We are here at the
decision of the president to support the U.S. Southern Command.''
   Hale is a brigade commander in the 7th Light Infantry Brigade
and is leading the contingent here.
   On the flight down, Marine Lt. Col. Jerry Humble, told
reporters: ``I think we are going to be here until this is
resolved.''
   ``With what's going on down there any prudent American would be
concerned with the sort of civil disorder there,'' said Humble, 41,
of Owensboro, Ky.
   The troops walked past a large passenger lounge where some
military dependents were making arrangements to fly back to the
United States. They were some of the nearly 3,000 military and
civilian dependents that were moved into army bases Friday for
security reasons.
   Mrs. Cheryl Hohl and her two children Meghan, 4, Ryan, 2,
watched the solders file by.
   ``I have been here for 18 months. My husband and I decided it
would be better if I went back to Baltimore,'' she said. ``I lived
on the base. I had Panamanian friends. I never was afraid while I
lived here.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Calls Teen Abortion Law Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court Friday called
Florida's abortion-consent law ``constitutionally infirm,''
agreeing with a lower court judge who had declared the law could
not be enforced.
   In a 2-1 ruling, the 5th District Court of Appeal here upheld a
decision by Lake Circuit Judge Jerry Lockett, who ruled May 4 that
the law requiring parental or judicial consent for a minor to seek
an abortion was too vague.
   The appeals court also said the state law failed to protect the
privacy of minors guaranteed under Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S.
Supreme Court decision which made abortion legal.
   The appeals court remanded the case back to Lockett with the
order than he dismiss the petition filed by a 15-year-old pregnant
teen-ager who had sought his permission for an abortion.
   ``The decision to terminate the pregnancy is up to (the girl)
and her physician without state regulation,'' the court ruled.
   The court said the vagueness of the law opened up ``a clear
danger that trial judges would render a decision on the basis of
their own moral, religious or political beliefs regarding
abortion.''
   The appellate court's rulings are binding statewide unless _ as
often happens in controversial cases _ another state appeals court
takes a similar case and reaches a different decision, said Volusia
Circuit Judge C. McFerrin Smith.
   Then, for the decision to apply statewide, it would have to be
appealed to the Florida Supreme Court.
   The law approved by the Legislature last year requires single
girls under 18 to get permission from a parent, guardian or judge
before obtaining an abortion.
   The law says judges can approve an abortion if they decide the
girl is sufficiently mature to make the decision, if consent is
unreasonably withheld by a parent or guardian or if the girl fears
emotional or physical abuse if she tells her parents.
   Lockett declared the law unconstitutional after being asked to
give permission for an abortion to a 15-year-old girl who was 11
weeks pregnant.
   Lockett said the law was too vague and couldn't be properly
handled in the courts. Lockett in his ruling said he couldn't hold
a proper hearing on the issue because he's unsure what the law
means by ``sufficiently mature.''
   The Florida law took effect Oct. 1. Five days later, a federal
court barred its enforcement because no implementation rules were
included. The ban was lifted when the Florida Supreme Court issued
the rules in February.
   The Lake case was appealed by attorney Jerry Blair of Leesburg,
who is representing the girl. All of the proceedings are secret and
court files are sealed to protect her identity.

   Schoolmates of 30 years ago were stunned to
learn they may have been on a list of names to be ``punished'' by
David Schoenecker, who allegedly confessed to the killing of his
wife in a newspaper letter.
   ``I would have never guessed,'' said Lee Borowski, who played on
the basketball team with with Schoenecker at Custer High School.
``He was intense. But he was a happy-go-lucky guy.''
   Schoenecker was arrested near the Idaho-Montana border Friday,
the day after a newspaper columnist in Anaheim, Calif., received a
letter allegedly written by Schoenecker saying he had killed his
wife, Gail, last week in their California home.
   The letter also warned about a list of people who would be
``punished.'' When authorities found the woman's body, they
discovered a list of 54 names, many who are relatives or
acquaintances of Schoenecker living in the Milwaukee area.
   Some of those on the list were people he knew in high school,
police said.
   ``I gave him good grades _ so I hope he's not after me,'' said
William Van Valzah, an instructor at Custer High who taught
architectural drafting to Schoenecker. ``He was a doer, he wasn't a
bragger. He always worked to the best of his ability.''
   Schoenecker, 48, graduated from Custer High in 1959. He was the
senior class president, and among his activities were football,
basketball, track, the math club and the German club.
   Schoenecker's 1959 yearbook describes how he was a star football
player. ``He was an individual who performed well,'' said Richard
Hinchcliffe, a guidance counselor at the school who was an
assistant coach on the football team. ``He was a pleasure to
coach.''
   Two of the people on the hit list live in Wauwatosa, a suburb of
Milwaukee.
   ``They were surprised they were among the select few,'' said
police Lt. Greg Naumann, who did not disclose the names. ``There
was no rhyme or reason to it.''
   Naumann said the people described themselves as acquaintances of
Schoenecker, but not close friends.
   The list also included Schoenecker's ex-wife, Kathy Schoenecker,
who has remarried.
   ``He is absolutely not a violent person,'' she told The
Milwaukee Journal. ``He's a super-intelligent person, loves
attention.''
   David and Gail Schoenecker moved to Anaheim about two years ago,
where Mrs. Schoenecker worked as an elementary school teacher.
   Schoenecker worked as a chemical engineer for Johnson Controls
Inc., based in Milwaukee, and was eventually transferred to
California.
   Schoenecker's letter to an Orange County Register columnist said
he killed his wife because she didn't understand the premonitions
and ``images'' he had about people who had ``done wrong or evil''
against him.
   The Schoenecker neighbors in Anaheim described the couple as
reclusive and withdrawn.
   ``It was like they didn't exist,'' said neighbor David Burgin.
``Everybody in the neighborhood has kids and we are all very close.
But they just aren't part of that. The house always sits there like
it's empty. Here it's been a whole week but nobody noticed anything
wrong.''
   The couple's next door neighbor in Anaheim, Elizabeth Kish, said
she heard occasional arguments.
   ``I would hear them yelling at each other, although I don't know
what the arguments were about. I have sometimes heard her crying,''
she said.
   Nilsa Hernandez-Bakula, who taught with Mrs. Schoenecker at St.
Thomas Aquinas School in Milwaukee in 1981, said: ``She was always
citing (David's) immaturity. He was having problems holding a job.''

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Delay Ethics Regulations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Friday to delay for 60 days
the implementation of ethics regulations that several federal
officials have blamed for their decisions to retire early.
   The delay, passed by unanimous consent, is expected to go to the
House for a vote Monday, said a spokeswoman for Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, who sponsored the measure at the Bush administration's
request.
   The regulations, which would take effect Tuesday without the
delay, were cited as a reason for this week's retirement of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's acting chief of the
space station, Thomas L. Moser.
   Other NASA officials and officials in other federal agencies
have announced their retirements in recent weeks in an effort to
avoid being covered by the regulations.
   The regulations would prohibit federal contractors from hiring
government officials who have supervised their competitors'
projects. The contractors would be subject to fines of up to $1
million and imprisonment of up to five years.
   The administration sought the 60-day delay so employees could be
trained in the details of the rules, Glenn's spokeswoman said. The
law was passed in October and draft rules were released in March.
   The rules were intended to eliminate the types of problems that
have come to light in the Pentagon procurement scandal.

   A judge threatened to jail movie producer
Robert Evans for contempt of court Friday after he refused to
testify about a 6-year-old murder case involving his movie ``The
Cotton Club.''
   Evans invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self
incrimination.
   ``Mr. Evans, this court can hold you in contempt and this court
can order you incarcerated if you do not answer the questions, do
you understand that, sir?'' asked Municipal Court Judge Patti Jo
McKay.
   ``Yes,'' Evans replied almost in a whisper.
   His lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro said the producer of such hits as
``The Godfather,'' ``Chinatown'' and ``Love Story'' refused to
testify because the prosecution refuses to clear him as a suspect
in the murder of Roy Radin.
   Radin, a New York theatrical producer, was found shot to death
in 1983. Cocaine, the lure of easy money and Hollywood avarice
surrounded his murder, authorities said.
   Radin had offered to help Evans raise funds for ``The Cotton
Club'' before he disappeared.
   Prosecutors allege Karen Delayne ``Laynie'' Greenberger, a
41-year-old reputed drug dealer, ordered Radin's killing in a
dispute over a multimillion-dollar deal to finance the 1984 film
``The Cotton Club.''
   ``Mr. Evans has told me that he is absolutely innocent of any
involvement,'' Shapiro told the judge. But he added he could not
advise Evans to testify while a cloud of suspicion hangs over him.
   Deputy District Attorney David Conn said he would not grant
Evans immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony.
   ``Mr. Evans is a witness and he is nothing more than a witness
at this time,'' said Conn. He suggested that if Evans is innocent,
nothing he says could incriminate him.
   The judge granted a request by Shapiro for time to file legal
citations with the court. She ordered Evans to return to court
Monday morning.
   Evans had waited in the courthouse most of the day while
procedural motions were argued. He was called as the first witness
in a case involving Hollywood's inner circle, the porno empire of
``Hustler'' magazine publisher Larry Flynt and a major cocaine
network.
   The judge denied a motion to dismiss the case on grounds that
the time limit for beginning a speedy preliminary hearing had
elapsed. She also refused to allow cameras in the courtroom during
the hearing.
   Key witnesses in the case include actor Demond Wilson, the
one-time star of ``Sanford and Son'' who was a friend of Radin, and
Flynt's former brother-in-law, William Ryder, who headed an army of
private security guards who protected Flynt.
   Mrs. Greenberger's three codefendants, Alex Lamota Marti,
William Molony Mentzer and Robert Ulmer Lowe, former Flynt
bodyguards, are alleged to have killed Radin for financial gain.
Lowe remains in Maryland where he is fighting extradition.
   The Radin case had remained a mystery since 1983. But late last
year Ryder came forward saying he had new information to offer.
Prosecutors reportedly ``wired'' him with tape recording devices
and sent him to gather evidence.
   Cocaine, money and the movie business were said to have led to
Radin's death.
   Mrs. Greenberger, who was said to have close ties to the Latin
American drug network of Carlos Lehder, was identified early on as
the woman who introduced Radin to Evans as someone who could raise
money for ``The Cotton Club.''
   When Radin, 33, made a deal with the Puerto Rican government for
financing, Mrs. Greenberger demanded a large share of the movie
profits, the prosecutor has said. She also accused Radin of
stealing $1 million in cocaine and cash from her garage.
   The pudgy, cocaine-sniffing Radin had been last seen getting
into a limousine with Mrs. Greenberger en route to dinner at La
Scala restaurant in Beverly Hills.
   A month later, Radin's body was found in a dry riverbed near
Gorman about 65 miles north of Los Angeles. He had been shot in the
head.
   Evans, the former head of production at Paramount Pictures, was
questioned by authorities but never charged in the case. Conn has
refused to rule him out as a suspect and said he hoped Evans'
testimony in court will clarify his role.
   In recent years, Mrs. Greenberger, 41, lived in Okeechobee,
Fla., where last September, her husband Larry was found shot to
death at their home. Larry Greenberger was reputed to be a key
figure in the Colombian drug empire of Lehder, who is now serving a
life sentence plus 135 years in federal prison in Marion, Ill.

   Nicaragua and the Soviet Union on Friday denounced President
Bush's decision to send more U.S. troops to Panama, with Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega calling the action illegal.
   Vadim Perfiliev, a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, told
reporters in Moscow the Panamanian situation was marred by U.S.
interference.
   ``It is a matter for the Panamanian people themselves to clear
up the situation and break the deadlock,'' he said. ``Any outside
interference is only exacerbating the already very serious
situation.''
   Perfiliev said it was vital to avoid creating ``another hotbed
of international tension.''
   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia said Friday the
Panamanian government, controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
should try to reach a compromise with the opposition but it did not
make any suggestions.
   Ortega, speaking at a news conference in Dublin, Ireland at the
end of a 10-nation tour of Europe, said, ``What the Bush
administration has done is absolutely illegal under the U.N.
Charter.''
   ``It is absolutely inadmissible for the United States to resort
to the use or threat of use of force,'' he added. ``We can
guarantee that no Latin American is going to defend the U.S. use of
force or threat of the use of force in Panama.''
   Ortega claimed the United States spent millions of dollars to
destablize Panama's election. ``The United States had said even
before the elections took place that it would not respect the
results,'' he said. ``This has led us to a crisis which as Latin
Americans must concern us.''
   ``If foreign support is required for Panama, let it come from
within Latin American countries, but always within the framework of
international law,'' Ortega said.
   Barricada, the newspaper of Nicaragua's ruling Sandinistas, said
Friday Bush's decision to reinforce the U.S. troops in Panama means
the United States hopes to renege on the agreement to relinquish
the Panama Canal at the end of the century.
   The Managua newspaper said the Bush administration is seeking
``to recover perpetual rights over the canal and assure its control
over the hemisphere.''
   It quoted officials as saying the Sandinista army remained in a
state of combat alert to repel any possible U.S. military
intervention in Central America. Reporters in Managua said no
unusual military activity was apparent.
   In Japan, the Foreign Ministry said the government ``has been
deeply concerned with reports indicating various injustices in the
Panamanian presidential and other elections on May 7.''
   A statement said the government ``strongly deplores'' the
attacks against opposition candidates and such conduct is
inexcusable in international society.
   Commenting on the Panamanian Electoral Tribunal's action
Wednesday nullifying the election, the ministry said that although
it was a domestic issue ``the decision is totally regrettable.''
   ``The Panamanian people have the right to decide on the future
of the country,'' it said. ``Japan strongly calls upon the
government of Panama to respect the general will of its people and
hopes that political stability in Panama will be established as
soon as possible.''

   Four members of the Ecclesia Athletic
Association were convicted of first-degree manslaughter Friday in
the beating death of an 8-year-old girl.
   Prosecutors said Dayna Broussard, daughter of the group's
founder, was struck hundreds of times Oct. 13 as punishment for
stealing food from another child's plate.
   The Clackamas County Circuit Court jury, after deliberating
about 11 hours over two days, returned the guilty verdicts against
Willie K. Chambers, 35, of San Diego; Brian K. Brinson, 31;
Constance Z. Jackson, 38; and Frederick P. Doolittle, 28, all of
Los Angeles.
   The defendants were stoic as the jury was polled. Defense
attorneys said they would appeal the verdict.
   Circuit Judge John Lowe said he would order a presentence report
before setting a sentencing date. Each of the four faces a maximum
penalty of 20 years in prison.
   Witnesses testified that Chambers did most of the beating, while
Doolittle and Brinson held the girl down. Jackson was accused of
striking and biting the child.
   Eldridge Broussard Jr. founded the group in the Watts area of
Los Angeles to steer children away from drugs and crime and to
motivate them through tough discipline and athletic training.
Broussard, 35, was in Los Angeles at the time of his daughter's
death at a farmhouse about 30 miles southeast of Portland.
   His daughter was beaten with an electrical cord, rubber hose,
piece of plastic pipe, bamboo pole and weightlifting belt,
witnesses testified.
   Most of the 53 other children who were staying at the Sandy-area
house were forced to watch the beating, prosecutors said. Several
testified that Dayna was slammed against a wall, kicked, tripped,
slapped, dropped on the floor, shoved, bitten, spit upon and hung
out a window.
   After Dayna's body was delivered to a fire station, the other
children, ranging in age from 1{ months to 16 years, were taken
into state custody. The children now are living in foster homes or
with relatives.
   The children were brought to Oregon last summer while the Los
Angeles center was being renovated.
   Broussard did not attend the trial, but his wife, whose name
also is Dayna, attended parts of it.
   Broussard has blamed negative news coverage for his daughter's
death. He denied that the children were beaten or abused, saying
they were only ``spanked.''
   Deputy District Attorney Alfred J. French III contended all four
defendants acted in concert to beat the child.
   Defense attorneys countered that the defendants did not know the
child was in danger of dying during the discipline session and they
questioned whether the girl died of the beating or of treatment she
received in efforts to revive her.
   They called to the witness stand Dr. William Brady, former state
medical examiner, who said the act of hanging the child out a
window was the ``precipitating'' cause of death.
   The current medical examiner, Dr. Larry Lewman, testified for
the prosecution that the girl died of blows to the head.

   A mother was charged Friday with
concealing a homicide and obstructing justice in the 1986 death of
her firstborn daughter, as authorities try to unravel the mystery
of her second baby's slaying two weeks ago.
   Paula Sims, 29, and her husband, Robert, reported each of the
baby girls abducted by a masked gunman who threatened Mrs. Sims and
took the infants while Sims was at work.
   Authorities have considered them suspects in both deaths. No
charges have been filed in the latest case.
   Jersey County State's Attorney Richard J. Ringhausen signed a
criminal complaint Friday alleging one count of concealing a
homicide and three counts of obstructing justice in the death three
years ago of 13-day-old Loralei Sims, said Linda Long, chief deputy
court clerk.
   Mrs. Sims turned herself to county authorities a few hours after
charges were filed. She was arrested and then released on 10
percent of a $100,000 bond, covered with a cashier's check signed
by her father.
   She was accompanied by her attorney, Donald Groshong, who
entered a plea of innocent on all charges. Groshong demanded access
to all information gathered by the state.
   Neither Mrs. Sims nor her attorney had any comment, although
Groshong has said previously the couple is innocent of any
wrongdoing.
   Sims was not named in the complaint, which says Mrs. Sims knew
Loralei had died ``by homicidal means'' and gave false information
to county Sheriff Frank Yocom and state police investigators.
   At a news conference, Ringhausen said the charges were prompted
by concerns that the three-year statute of limitations on the
charges was about to run out. The statute does not apply to murder
cases.
   ``Certainly it has been on my mind a long time,'' said county
Sheriff Frank Yocom, the chief investigator. ``Indeed I've said for
a long time I want to see this cleared.''
   The charges are the first in the case, which began June 17,
1986, when the Simses told police that a masked gunman broke into
their home and abducted Loralei.
   The decomposed remains of a baby, believed to be Loralei, were
found several days later following an intensive search near the
couple's home in Brighton, a rural Jersey County community.
   The Simses refused to answer questions before the grand jury
that considered the case in early 1987, citing their Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination. The panel took no
action.
   Mrs. Sims appeared Thursday before a grand jury in Madison
County, where the couple have since moved. That jury is hearing
evidence in the death of the Simses' 6-week-old second baby girl,
Heather Lee. Mrs. Sims' parents and her husband's sister and
brother-in-law also were subpoenaed.
   Sims, 37, was not asked to appear. Police have said he told them
he believes his wife may have killed their daughters accidentally.
   On April 29, the couple reported that Heather Lee was abducted
from the family's new home in Alton, about 10 miles from Brighton.
   Her body was found in a trash barrel May 3 across the
Mississippi River in West Alton, Mo. An autopsy showed she was
smothered by someone putting a hand over her mouth. Tests also
indicated that the body had been frozen.
   The family buried Heather on Wednesday next to the unmarked
grave containing the remains believed to be Loralei's.
   The couple also have a son, 15-month-old Randy, who was removed
to state custody last week. Witnesses have said Mrs. Sims wanted a
son and was unhappy at the births of her daughters.

<HEAD>U.N. Man's Suitcase Still Seen As Possible Air Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four months after the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing,
the FBI is still inquiring about the suitcase carried by one
victim, Bernt Carlsson, the United Nations commissioner for
Namibia, a news report said Saturday.
   The London newspaper The Independent said it was clear from
conversations with Carlsson's family and friends that investigators
have not ruled out the possibility that he was the unwitting
carrier of the bomb.
   The paper said it had never been suggested Carlsson was the
target of the bomb. But it said Carlsson's sister, Inger, recently
reported that FBI investigators asked her to describe his suitcase,
and on Friday the FBI interviewed a woman ``with whom Carlsson had
been living.''
   Other reports have said the FBI and the CIA concluded the
bombing was done by the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command at Iran's behest. Some speculated that a
U.S. student who had an Arab boyfriend may have been tricked into
bringing the device on board.
   New York-bound Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland last
Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. The
flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, changing planes at
London's Heathrow airport.
   Investigators say a bomb in a portable radio in the hold
destroyed the plane. The crime is still under investigation.
   The Independent said that since Carlsson traveled business
class, his suitcase would have been loaded in a forward bay of
Flight 103 where investigators say the bomb exploded.

   Former U.S. Solicitor General Rex E. Lee was
named Friday as the 10th president of the Mormon Church-owned
Brigham Young University, the nation's largest private university.
   Lee, 54, succeeds Jeffrey R. Holland, who was appointed to a
church leadership position on April 1. Lee is to assume the
presidency July 1.
   The appointment was announced to more than 8,000 students,
faculty and staff members by Gordon B. Hinckley, first counselor in
the governing First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.
   In his acceptance speech, Lee said BYU occupies a unique place
among the world's universities.
   ``What puts us in a class by ourselves is that our reason for
existence is not just to nurture the intellect, but the entire
soul, of which the intellect is a constituent part,'' he said.
   Lee was appointed solicitor general by President Reagan in 1981
and served until 1985, representing the government before the U.S.
Supreme Court. He had been an assistant U.S. attorney general in
charge of the Justice Department's civil division from 1975 to 1976.
   Lee was the founding dean of BYU's J. Reuben Clark Law School
from 1972 to 1981 and since 1985 has been the law school's George
Sutherland Professor of Law and a partner in a Washington, D.C.,
law firm.

<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
on Friday announced a $19.4 million emergency aid program for a
million people in Somalia driven from their homes by war and
rebellion.
   The United Nations approved the program after Somalia adopted
political reforms. The West has criticized the East African nation
over its tactics in fighting a rebellion by the Somali National
Movement.
   The government of President Mohammed Siad Barre has been
battling the insurrection in the north for the last seven years.
   Somalia's 5.3 million people live in one of the poorest nations
in the world.
   The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
temporarily withheld food aid this year because it feared Somalia
was drafting Ethiopian refugees into its army to fight the
insurgents.
   Amnesty International and other human rights groups accused
Somalia of widespread arrests, detentions and sanctioning summary
executions last year in an attempt to crush the Ethiopia-based
rebels.
   A U.N. mission to Somalia from Feb. 25 to March 12 found ``the
constitution has been amended to include the principle of habeas
corpus. A general amnesty has been proclaimed and many political
detainees have been released,''said a U.N. statement.
   The director of the U.N.'s Office of Emergency Operations,
Charles-Henri La Muniere, has said more than 600,000 people are
living in camps and 400,000 are scattered throughout Somalia
because of attacks on towns and villages.
   In addition to shipping 7,290 tons of food, the program proposes
to rebuild water systems, restore hospitals and basic health care,
and rehabilitate war-damaged areas.
   Ethiopia and Somalia went to war in 1977 for control of the
Ogaden region, leading to hundreds of thousands of Somali and
Ethiopian rerfugees. A treaty last year formally ended the conflict.
   About 70,000 Somalis are displaced in their own nation.
   Somalia receives U.S. aid because of agreements under which the
U.S. military may use Somali bases in the event of Mideast conflict.
   The United States already has a large naval base at Berbera,
Somalia, on the Gulf of Aden.

<HEAD>Rent Hike Compromise Proposed for Subsidized AIDS Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People with AIDS who are living in
city-sponsored apartments may have their rent raised from 25
percent of their stipends to 30 percent, the city said Friday.
   The proposed increase would initially affect only about 20
people who have AIDS and live in city-sponsored apartments, said
Lee Jones, a mayoral spokesman. More people would be affected as
additional apartments are readied.
   The proposal was disclosed after City Council President Andrew
Stein criticized an earlier proposal to raise the amount to 40
percent.
   ``People with AIDS are barely able to survive under the current
formula,'' Stein said in letters to city Human Resources
Administrator William Grinker and Budget Director Paul Dickstein.
   ``It is unjust for your office to now institute a policy
compelling these individuals to hand over almost half of their
monthly check,'' he wrote.
   Grinker and Dickstein replied that, given the current
Supplemental Security Income each person with AIDS gets per month,
the increase to 30 percent will leave them with $312 to spend for
other needs.
   They said it costs the city about $1,500 a month to support each
apartment because of social-support services provided.
   The proposed increase will be included in the mayor's fiscal
1990 budget proposal, due next week.

   Huge cargo jets brought in fresh U.S.
troops Friday, and the government said it was suspending classes
for 660,000 students because of actions by the ``deranged
administration of President Bush.''
   U.S. military and diplomatic dependents and Panamanian foes of
the regime under Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega took refuge at U.S.
military bases.
   Bush ordered in about 1,900 troops Thursday after supporters of
Noriega, Panama's de facto leader, beat opposition candidates and
attacked protesters accusing Noriega of stealing Sunday's
presidential election.
   The Roman Catholic church harshly denounced the government
Friday for the violence.
   ``What moral justification can there be for terrorizing the
population with gangs feeding on hate and a false nationalism?''
the church asked in an unusually strong statement.
   The new U.S. troops augment approximately 10,400 troopers
already here. They will help defend the canal, provide security and
assist in moving U.S. citizens if need be, said Col. Ronald
Sconyers, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command.
   Panama said Friday it was suspending the start of school at all
levels because of violence and civil disobedience inspired by the
United States and the political opposition.
   Education Minister Rolando Murga decided to postpone classes for
approximately 600,000 public school and 60,000 university students
for ``reasons of physical safety,'' a government statement said.
   Most classes here start May 22. Some have already started.
   ``The deranged government of President Bush is now attempting
with acts of violence and civil disobedience ... to destroy social
order, peace, tranquillity and life,'' the statement said.
   The government-controlled afternoon newspaper Ultimas Noticias
named Bush ``Bum of the Day,'' a regular front-page feature that
usually targets local opposition politicians.
   The U.S. cargo jets landed at Howard Air Force Base, five miles
west of Panama City, at half hour intervals, bringing Marines from
Camp Lejeune, N.C., and soldiers from the 7th Light Infantry
Division at Fort Ord, Calif.
   ``We are proud to be here,'' said Army brigade commander Col.
David Hale.
   Lt. Col. Jerry Humble, commander of the Second Light Armored
Infantry Battalion, told reporters on the flight to Panama: ``I
think we're going to be here until this is resolved.''
   ``With what's going on down there any prudent American would be
concerned,'' said Humble, 41, of Owensboro, Ky.
   Meanwhile, the opposition coalition, which claims a 3-1 victory
in Sunday's elections, thanked all governments, especially those in
Latin America, that have protested fraud and violence.
   It again offered to take part in a patriotic agreement that
would get the country out from under Noriega's ``corrupt and
dictatorial'' rule.
   The pro-government presidential candidate said Panama's
elections had been nullified because of U.S. interference.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara, who was
beaten by pro-Noriega gangs on Wednesday, celebrated his 53rd
birthday at a hospital with presents and cake.
   He was listed in good condition and high spirits Friday.
   A U.S. military source said that since Monday more than 160
Panamanians have been given refuge at U.S. military installations.
   ``They are here because they have shown that they are in
physical danger for political reasons,'' said the source, who
refused to identify any of the Panamanians for fear of reprisals.
   International condemnation of the election and the beatings
continued to pour in Friday. Mexico withdrew its envoy for
consultations.
   Nicaragua and the Soviet Union, however, condemned the dispatch
of U.S. troops as interference.
   In Washington, the Organization of American States permanent
council approved unanimously a Venezuelan proposal calling for OAS
foreign ministers to meet Wednesday to discuss the crisis in Panama.
   In Panama City, most businesses returned to normal but the
opposition reportedly considered more demonstrations.
   There were backups at occasional Panamanian Defense Forces
checkpoints, where drivers' identifications were being checked.
   Noriega's hand-picked candidate Carlos Duque said in a letter to
the people in the government-controlled press that the vote was
nullified because ``the U.S. government wanted to impose its choice
at all costs.''
   Bush had sent a team of observers that said the government
rigged the election.
   At a news conference Thursday night all parties in the
government coalition publicly supported voiding the vote, which
happened while they were well ahead in official totals.
   International observers said tallies were being counterfeited to
cheat the opposition of a 3-1 victory.
   Noriega has not appeared in public since before Sunday's
election and has issued no statements on the breakdown of the
election process. He had gone into the elections seeking legitimacy
for the regime.
   Reports said civilian government politicians had told Noriega
the cheating was too obvious to continue with any legitimacy.
   There was no sign that discipline was breaking down in the army
or that unity was dissolving.
   At U.S. military bases, schools were closed and all unofficial
off-base activities, from shopping to scuba diving, were canceled.
   At the U.S. Embassy, where the U.S. staff was to be cut from 105
to less than 50, staffers were waiting for more detailed
instructions on who would go and when.
   Noriega is under federal drug indictments in Miami and Tampa,
Fla., and denies the charges. He has been the de facto leader of
Panama since he took control of the military in 1983.
   The U.S. imposed sanctions on Panama after Noriega engineered
the ouster of President Eric Delvalle in February 1988. The U.S.
government continues to recognize Delvalle instead of acting
President Manuel Solis Palma.

   Hundreds of American military
dependents evacuated their homes in Panama after President Bush
stepped up his offensive against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga by
ordering in nearly 2,000 combat troops.
   Bush on Thursday also recalled U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis to
protest the annulling of Sunday's election and the beating of the
opposition presidential and vice presidential candidates by
supporters of Noriega.
   The crisis convulsing this strategically important country
occurred after the government halted the counting of ballots
Wednesday after claiming its presidential candidate, handpicked by
Noriega, held a 2-1 lead.
   A team of international observers headed by former President
Jimmy Carter said the opposition presidential candidate, Guillermo
Endara, had won by a 3-to-1 measure despite widespread fraud.

   The Department of Veterans Affairs is taking
another look at the cases of all Vietnam veterans whose benefits
claims due to exposure to Agent Orange were denied, and easing the
standards for receiving compensation.
   The change became known Thursday when VA Secretary Edward
Derwinski said the government will not appeal a federal judge's
decision earlier this week that struck down regulations restricting
compensation for victims of Agent Orange.
   Derwinski's decision was seen as a major step toward disability
benefits for some of the more than 34,000 veterans of the Vietnam
War who have unsuccessfully sought to have the government admit
their exposure to the toxic herbicide has caused health problems.
   Derwinski said the VA will follow the judge's instructions to
review all previously denied claims and use new, statistical
standards to decide whether specific diseases are presumed to have
been caused by Agent Orange exposure.

American Jewish groups.

   President Carlos Andres Perez marked
his first 100 days in office today on an ominous note _ unions set
a strike date to protest austerity measures ordered by the
International Monetary Fund. Similar protests last winter sparked
clashes that left nearly 300 Venezuelans dead.
   If the first nationwide strike in 31 years of democratic rule
goes off as scheduled next Thursday, it would underscore the social
democratic leader's difficulties in convincing Venezuelans that his
program will lift this oil-producing nation out of its economic
doldrums.
   Leaders of the powerful Venezuelan Workers Confederation have
vowed to bring the country to a standstill with the strike, saying
a massive work stoppage would force Perez ``to twist and rectify''
his controversial plan.
   The elimination overnight of a number of subsidies that for
years kept prices down triggered a wave of violence in Caracas and
the deaths of at least 276 people in late February and early March.
The elimination of subsidies on basic commodities had been
advocated by the IMF.

   A string of rare bird thefts at several
zoos around the country is prompting more stringent security, and
even leading some zoos to pull the valuable animals from exhibits.
   On May 2, a thief broke into the parrot cage at the Rio Grande
Zoological Park here and took an Australian king parrot, a
sulphur-crested cockatoo and a dusky lory.
   The global destruction of rain forests, the birds' natural
habitat, and export restrictions imposed by foreign countries have
driven up the value of rare birds and encouraged thefts, officials
say.
   Zoos in Los Angeles, San Diego, El Paso, Texas, Columbia, S.C.,
and elsewhere have been hit in recent years.

   Approval came after a two-hour meeting that featured expressions

   The American business community has
been able to operate successfully in Panama despite political
violence, government-fanned hostility toward the United States and
U.S. sanctions against the government.
   The community plans to stay open for business, but its greatest
threats come from long-range political instability and a continued
economic downturn, said a spokesman for the American Chamber of
Commerce and Industries of Panama.
   Companies gradually are relocating and will keep doing so as
long as Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega remains in power and U.S.
sanctions remain in place, he said.
   The spokesman, who also is a partner in a Panamanian business,
asked not to be named for fear of reprisal.
   ``I don't see any short-run solution,'' he said Friday.
``Members of the chamber don't feel our friend (Noriega) is showing

   At least two people were reported missing and firefighters and
police combed the wreckage of the residential neighborhood hours

   The Southern Pacific freight apparently lost its brakes toward

Pacific spokesman Doug Stephanson.

   Every day 12-year-old Shashi Bushan Das
starts out at dawn with a burlap sack over his bony shoulder. At
the end of the day, the sack is bulging with trash and if he's
lucky he has earned the equivalent of $1.
   Shashi is a ragpicker, one of the tens of thousands of children
in New Delhi who scrounge through garbage bins, gutters and waste
dumps.
   Trash dealers buy what they find _ paper, plastic shopping bags,
parts of automobiles, and pieces of brass and tin.
   The children start out at 5 a.m. and work in pairs until noon,
when they stop for their first meal of the day.
   A survey published by Praveen Nangia, a social scientist and
expert on child labor, says 80 percent of these children live alone
and sleep on sidewalks in the summer and in government-run shelters
during the winter.
   ``By the time these children, who are aged between 5 and 15,
reach the junk dealer their sacks weigh nearly 10 to 15 kilograms
(22 to 33 pounds),'' the survey said.
   Dreary as it may seem, ragpicking is one of the more lucrative
forms of child labor in India today. An expert picker may earn up
to $1 a day. The daily per capita income of India is 66 cents.
   ``There is lot of money in garbage,'' said Gerry J. Pinto of the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), who works on the
organization's program for destitute children in India.
   Ragpicking pays more than any other form of child labor in India
where every third child works, said Vidyaben Shah, president of the
Indian Council for Child Welfare, a voluntary organization with
offices in each of India's 25 states.
   No official estimates are available on the number of ragpickers
in India. Pinto puts the figure at 50,000 but adds he could be wide
off the mark.
   Pinto said that although a law regulates working conditions for
child laborers in most industries, none covers ragpickers, ``who
are doing a very legitimate service to the city.''
   ``Most of these children are runaways, forced to flee homes in
villages because of poverty or family breakups and now fighting for
survival in the towns,'' he said.
   ``Ragpicking is the easiest thing to do when a child lands up in
the city. You don't need any skills, you don't need licenses and
you can go into business directly after gettng down from the bus or
train.''
   Shashi operates in areas around the railroad station, which was
the first landmark he saw on arriving eight months ago.
   Shashi said he ran away from his remote village in the eastern
state of Bihar after he got into altercation with his schoolmaster.
   ``He deliberately failed me in exams even though I had studied
well. And then my father beat me up so I ran away,'' said Shashi.
   ``These children poke their hands in garbage dumps where dirty
pigs and dogs nuzzle for food. They live in garbage, sleep in
garbage and wake up in garbage,'' said Ms. Shah, who has worked
with street children for the past 30 years.
   Nangia's survey, taken from interviews with children from six
areas of the city, indicated that none of them wants to be in the
business forever.
   Shashi already is planning something else.
   ``In six months I will save money to buy a cart,'' he said.
``Then I will sell peanuts and cucumbers.''

   Stacy Keach didn't mind the 125-foot parachute
plunge into downtown's Glitter Gulch, the motorcycle chase across
the desert or squaring off against ex-football terror Lyle Alzado.
   But don't ask him to repeat that 50-yard swim in 50-degree Lake
Mead _ at least not with his shoes on.
   Keach spent a week here in early March filming a two-hour movie,
``Murder Takes All _ Mike Hammer in Las Vegas.'' The movie will air
Sunday on CBS.
   ``Hammer in Las Vegas'' tested the mettle of Keach, 47, who has
a penchant for doing many of his own stunts.
   And it provided a new challenge for Jay Bernstein, the Hollywood
producer who stood by Keach when the actor served nine months in an
English prison on drug charges in 1985, at the zenith of the weekly
detective show's popularity.
   Bernstein was determined to keep Hammer alive and Keach a viable
commodity in the PR conscious film industry. His tenacity played a
major role in salvaging both.
   ``I put two mortgages on my house and went on the road selling
the Hammer series'' to the public, Bernstein said in a telephone
interview from his Los Angeles office. ``I believe in America you
only pay once for a debt, once for a mortgage, once for a mistake.
We let people have a second chance.''
   Bernstein says his efforts resulted in an outpouring of 400,000
letters backing Keach. The result: a 1986 TV movie, ``The Return of
Mike Hammer,'' and a new Hammer series in the 1986-87 season.
   With the series behind them, Bernstein and Keach are looking at
three two-hour Hammer movies, the first set in Las Vegas, providing
all the action, sex, glamour and excitement befitting Mickey
Spillane's famous detective hero.
   Keach said he doesn't miss the weekly series. ``You can tell a
better story in two hours,'' he said. ``Generally you get a better
show.''
   The first day of filming, Keach wafted into the heart of the
downtown casino district on a parachute.
   ``Mike Hammer gets thrown out of a plane and lands in the middle
of Las Vegas,'' Keach explained. ``Of course! Why not?''
   In reality, Keach was hoisted 125 feet into the air by a crane,
then floated down as thousands of spectators watched.
   The next two days were spent at Lake Mead, filming on and around
a 56-foot yacht, the Hilton Hotel's Lady Hilton.
   One scene called for Hammer to jump from the yacht just before
it exploded, then swim 50 yards to a waiting boat. Keach performed
the stunt himself, wearing a wetsuit to help ward off the chill.
But he learned in the first take that it was a serious mistake to
wear shoes.
   ``I'm telling you, you almost lost me,'' Keach told publicist
Welton Smith after struggling out of the water. Subsequent takes
were shot with Keach swimming shoeless.
   ``This is as much of a workout as I've had for any Mike Hammer
show,'' Keach said, after a scene in which he confronted Alzado.
   In another scene, Keach and a villain wrestle in a surveillance
area above the Hilton's giant casino, then crash through the
ceiling onto a craps table below. It's one of the few scenes where
Keach opts for a double.
   Keach said when he first read the script, he figured there would
be no chance of doing the scene, ``because I knew you'd never find
a place in Las Vegas that would let you shoot something like that.''
   Casino owners are skittish about filming in gaming areas, but
the idea was welcomed by Hilton publicity director Bruce Banke, who
is interested in promoting use of the hotel as a shooting location
for TV and motion picture films.
   Bernstein thinks Las Vegas is a perfect locale for Mike Hammer.
   ``Anything you can do to get Mike Hammer as a fish out of water
is good,'' Bernstein said. ``In Las Vegas, you're putting him in
another fish-out-of-water situation, this time with neon.''
   Hammer will really be a fish-out-of-water in two upcoming films
with locations planned for Singapore and behind the Iron Curtain.

   Elsewhere in television:
   SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE _ The final episode of ``M-A-S-H''
remains the highest-rated television show since 1960, according to
the latest list compiled by Nielsen Media Research. It had a 60.2
rating when it aired Feb. 28, 1983, on CBS. The 1980 ``Who Shot
J.R.?'' episode of ``Dallas'' on CBS is still second on the list.
Those shows are followed by the final episode of ABC's 1977
blockbuster miniseries ``Roots.'' Just for perspective, NBC's ``The
Cosby Show,'' the most successful sitcom ever and the most
successful prime-time network show in recent years, is only 57th on
the all-time list.

<HEAD>Garrison Keillor Feels Lost After Lake Wobegon</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By CHARLES FERRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been two years since Garrison
Keillor came to Denmark to lead the life of a ``tall, silent
person,'' leaving behind Buster the Showdog, Sheila the Christian
Jungle Girl and other inhabitants of Lake Wobegon.
   During that time, he returned to the United States and managed
to put another book on the market. Now he's looking ahead to fresh
ventures, while trying to find a new spot on which to hang his hat.
   Keillor still calls Minnesota home, even though he has a place
in Manhattan, and makes frequent trips to his wife Ulla Skaerved's
native Denmark where they also have an apartment.
   His new book, ``We Are Still Married,'' is a potpourri of
letters, poems and stories written during the Reagan years. His
first book was about his fictional hometown, ``Lake Wobegon Days.''
His next was ``Leaving Home.''
   More than 4 million people tuned into American Public Radio's
``A Prairie Home Companion,'' Keillor's hit radio show that
celebrated the Norwegian bachelor farmers and others of the quiet,
imaginary little town of Lake Wobegon _ the town that time forgot.
The show started in 1974 and Keillor gave the last broadcast in
June 1987.
   To the end, ``A Prairie Home Companion'' was Keillor's show,
reflecting his diverse and sometimes cornball musical tastes and
his affection for small-town life. But since leaving the show,
Keillor has been unsettled and at loose ends.
   ``The worst possible thing is when all your dreams come true.
And mine did, including some I didn't realize I had. But I felt
better about facing up to those things in Minnesota,'' he said in
an interview.
   The show was broadcast from St. Paul, but the 46-year-old
Keillor staged it in Lake Wobegon, Minn., which became so familiar
that some listeners thought it was a real town.
   The monologues grew from a regional hit show into a national
phenomenon running more than a decade. Keillor's best-selling
``Lake Wobegon Days'' was the book version of his radio humor.
   The radio show made Keillor a nationally known figure. Wider
recognition came after the success of the book, and it generated a
resentment that he said took him by surprise.
   ``If somebody I'd gone to school with, whom I didn't think was
that smart to begin with, had written a book that sold a whole lot
of copies ... I would envy him. I know that I would,'' he said.
   Keillor said he felt forced to give up his home when the local
press took too much interest in his private life. ``It bewildered
me. I had no idea what they were aiming at,'' said Keillor. He felt
hatred directed against him, which was entirely strange to him.
   What bothered him most was that he couldn't see anything funny
about it: ``Usually I can think of something humorous about
something, but I've never been able to write about that. It just
seems so utterly grim.''
   Today, Keillor thinks less about that time, which he calls
awkward, confusing and embarrassing.
   He confessed to escaping the Midwest, first to Europe, then to
New York. ``I fled first to Copenhagen, sort of under the illusion
that I could live over here,'' he said.
   Keillor's move to Denmark was accompanied by much fanfare,
particularly since his humor played on themes of small-town America
and values inherited from the Scandinavian immigrants who settled
his Lake Wobegon. But he had problems working here, and found he
could write more easily in the United States.
   ``I was embarrassed and had to go back to America. I suppose
that was kind of embarrassing, too, to have failed so publicly, to
have planted your flag so publicly and having to pull it out,'' he
said.
   Denmark provided some anonymity, but the humorist feels like a
tourist here, and he cannot foresee adjusting to the Danish scene.
While in Copenhagen, he mixes socially with Danes and with other
Americans, shoots baskets near his home and does occasional
speaking engagements.
   After only a short spell on his first visit to the country, he
was so taken with Denmark that he thought it could be material for
a book. But that feeling of newness has worn off, and he now feels
he'd have trouble writing a few good paragraphs.
   Nonetheless, he has spent a good deal of time over the past
three years in Denmark and plans to continue doing so.
   ``I think it is such an amazing thing to come to another country
and marry someone from another country. It's miraculous,'' he said.
``And then to do it in middle age, to have a passionate romance
when you're 43. I can't wish things were different.''
   Keillor is concentrating on his writing, but would like to get
back onto the airwaves. ``I want to start up another radio show and
make something of the second half of my life.''

<HEAD>Adoptions Gone Awry Reveal Dark Side of System</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZANNE GAMBOA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Bob Chandler looks forward to the day
when his adopted daughter can live with his family again. Rhonda
Stanton looks forward to the day her adopted daughter can live with
someone else.
   Their stories differ, but both tell of a dark side of adoption:
   ``The excitement of adopting, falling in love with a child,
wanting the child desperately and deeply, and going through the
grief of learning you're not going to have the child you dreamed
about,'' Chandler said.
   Dan and Rhonda Stanton returned 2{-year-old Stacey to the
adoption agency after learning her brain had ceased developing.
Stacey lives with a foster family, but a judge has ruled the
Stantons cannot sever their parental ties.
   Bob and Cherry Chandler sent their daughter away for counseling
for sexual abuse she suffered before adoption _ abuse they blame
for breaking apart the family. They and five other sets of adoptive
parents are suing the state for failing to disclose the extent of
their children's pre-adoption abuse.
   ``Lack of information can destabilize an adoption that would
have otherwise been successful,'' said Richard Barth, associate
professor at the University of California-Berkeley School of Social
Welfare.
   Barth and an associate followed 1,000 adoptive families in
1980-1984 and found that the less information families had about
their children, the likelier were such problems as runaways,
disobedience or physical attacks.
   Ten percent to 15 percent of adoptions are stopped before
they're finalized and ``a smaller minority'' are dissolved,
estimated Jeff Rosenberg, director of public policy for the
National Commitee for Adoption, a Washington-based, non-profit
group of adoption agencies, parents, children and experts.
   The Stantons, who have been married 11 years, explored adoption
after exhausting all means to conceive. Their disappointment turned
to anticipation when they learned in 1985 that the private adoption
agency Hope Cottage was seeking 50 adoptive couples.
   In October 1986, 3-week-old Stacey came to their suburban Dallas
home.
   ``The moment she was placed in our arms, she was our baby,''
said Stanton, 39, an insurance agent. But Stacey's mental
development stopped at four to six months, said Mrs. Stanton. ``She
never learned to wave bye-bye, play patty-cake. Little Stacey never
tuned in.''
   By the time tests revealed Stacey would never develop, the
Stantons had adopted her. Stacey went back to Hope Cottage last
June, but Mrs. Stanton says emphatically, ``We didn't return her,
we gave her up.''
   Last July they asked Dallas Family Court Judge Hal Gaither to
legally declare the child not theirs. In February, they told
Gaither they were not equipped to raise a severely retarded child.
   ``I have a deep compassion for special children, but I don't
have the emotional makeup to teach them,'' said Mrs. Stanton, 41, a
former elementary schoolteacher.
   ``Where do you draw the line?'' Gaither said recently. ``Do you
allow the adoption agency to come back and pick up kids because
they cry at night or if it has blue eyes and you wanted green eyes?
No. You can't turn a child back in.''
   Gaither terminated the Stantons' visitation rights and relieved
them of financial responsibility, but refused to erase their
parental rights in case the adoption agency later had its own
financial or business problems. ``What if ... an adoption agency
agrees to take a child back into custody ... and they go bankrupt
or a new regime comes in and won't honor the contract, now where is
the kid?,'' he said.
   The Stantons say they endured painful criticism from friends and
judgment by strangers because of their highly publicized case.
   ``People said they could never give up their child, but they
were thinking of their little normal children,'' Mrs. Stanton said.
``I know even as I try to explain, they can't realize the pain. We
literally cried from the time we woke up to the time we went to
bed.''
   Chandler, minister of Highlands Christian Church in Dallas, says
he can understand. The first day his new daughter walked into their
home, she picked up markers and drew all over the carpet. Later,
she began lying and stealing. One day she threatened to kill the
Chandlers' two biological sons.
   ``Kids threaten,'' Chandler said. ``But there was a look in her
eye, a rage in her face that was horrifying.''
   Chandler, who decided to adopt because it was a Christian thing
to do, admits that as he tried to cope with his daughter's violent
behavior he thought about taking her back to the Texas Department
of Human Services.
   After many visits with counselors, the Chandlers finally found a
Colorado psychiatrist who said the girl's behavior was the result
of sexual abuse. She has been undergoing treatment at the Colorado
clinic since January; the Chandlers don't know when she'll be able
to come home.
   The Human Services Department revealed in a three-page summary
of the girl's case that she had been abused, but not the extent of
her mistreatment, Chandler said. ``The information we received was
very, very general.''
   With their lawsuit, the Chandlers and five other families hope
to force the state to give prospective parents more background
about adoptable children.
   A federal judge has ruled against the parents, saying they have
no constitutional right to the information they seek. Their appeal
is pending before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans.
   Health Services officials have declined to talk specifically
about the Chandler case while it is pending, but spokeswoman Diane
Scott said the agency has always told parents what type of home a
child came from and how the child came into custody of the agency,
as required by the Texas Family Code.
   The department must provide information on the child's health,
social, educational and genetic history, but can summarize that
background.
   Caseworkers also discuss any medical or psychological treatment
the child has undergone, Ms. Scott said. ``We also encourage the
families to talk with the child's physician or therapist to
understand the implications of the child's condition and need for
treatment.''
   The Texas Senate has passed a bill that would give parents the
right to see copies of all the children's records, edited to
protect birth parents. Adopted children would be able to see the
documents at adulthood.
   The Chandlers aren't sure if they would have adopted their
daughter had they known her history, but they believe the
information could have helped them address her problems sooner.
   The Stantons say they would like to have some part in Stacey's
life again when they are stronger, but they are unlikely to adopt
again.
   ``We can love again,'' Mrs. Stanton said, ``but that joy and
excitement she brought into our life _ you don't replace it.''

<TEXT>
   With more than 115 million records sold worldwide
and his 76th album due in the stores over the next several days,
selling records is still tough for superstar Julio Iglesias.
   ``It's the worst thing in life to sell records,'' the
45-year-old performer said in a recent interview. ``On stage, you
can be better. But ... once the record is in the shops, there's no
way to get it back.''
   ``Raices,'' Spanish for roots, is his latest album, out this
month. He and model Brooke Shields recently finished filming a
45-minute music video in Miami based on one of the album's songs.
The album will be released in Spanish, French, Italian and
Portuguese, but it will be an American sound, Iglesias said.
   ``It's very lively in a way, but in another way it's completely
different in the way we use instruments,'' he said. ``I love very
much this album _ I hope.''
   Even after Iglesias has sold 115 million records _ a number
comparable to Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen _ he wonders
whether he can keep up the pace in record sales. But he has doubts
about his success _ both in America and overseas.
   ``Success in life is illogical. There is not a logical answer.
If you have an explanation why you have success, you just have to
put in a computer this and this and this, and you are going to have
success in America. And it's not true,'' Iglesias said. ``So don't
ask me why I have success in America, because if I knew why I would
doubt it.''
   After a promising career as a professional soccer goalie in
Spain, Iglesias was in a car accident that paralyzed him from the
waist down. He underwent four years of intensive rehabilitation,
including exercising his injured fingers with a guitar his family
gave him.
   He vowed to his mother that he would sing at a Spanish song
festival, and Iglesias kept his vow in 1968. His singing career was
launched.
   Another challenge was learning English _ at 38 years old.
   ``In all the Latino roots of languages, like Italian and
Spanish, I found my music much more natural,'' Iglesias said.
``What's happened in English, for example, is that the phrasing is
completely different.''
   Iglesias has recorded only 30 songs in English, but some have
been hits, such as duets with such artists as Stevie Wonder, Willie
Nelson and Diana Ross. The native of Madrid has recorded 150 songs
in Spanish, 74 in French, 60 in Italian, 45 in Portuguese and 30 in
German.
   His black hair slicked straight back and wearing all white,
Iglesias said a third all-English album may be recorded sometime
this summer.
   ``It takes two years for me to do an English album correctly,''
he said. ``It takes too much stress out of my life to do an English
album. And I love to sing in English.''
   Iglesias, who is divorced and a father of two sons and a
daughter, lives in Indian Creek Village on a private island near
Miami Beach. He is part owner of the Miami Heat, the rookie pro
basketball team.
   He did one worldwide tour last year, and is planning another.
   As for his success with the tour _ that will be determined by
the outbreak of goose bumps.
   ``I always said in a concert of two hours, if you are able for
five minutes to put people in goose bumps, some people will never
forget you.''
   Some haven't.
   Iglesias has it all now. His personal life is balanced, and he
has all the money he needs. His only doubts are surviving as an
artist whose ballads can move an audience.
   ``There's a moment in your life when you don't need the money.
It's not a question of making you ... richer than you already are.
That's over in my life,'' Iglesias said. ``I don't need anything
else than success, than lights, than surviving as an artist.''

<HEAD>Singapore Wants To Be Hollywood East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singapore is wooing foreign moviemakers and
capital, as the great commercial center tries to become
Hollywood-on-the-South China Sea.
   International films are regularly shot on location here, but
there are no local studios. Now separate groups of investors from
Italy and Hong Kong have announced plans to build studios in the
western part of this city-state.
   Italy's Cecchi Gori Group agreed to spend $62.5 million to
develop two sound stages, outdoor sets, offices and other
facilities on 25-acre seaside site. Construction is expected to
start late this year or early 1990, according to Vittorio Cecchi
Gori, chairman of the group which also co-financed the Academy
Award-winning ``The Last Emperor.''
   When his subsidiary is completed, Cecchi Gori Summit Studios in
Singapore expects to produce as many as 10 English-language feature
films a year, he said.
   Work has already started on the second project, called Tang
Dynasty Village. The 30-acre area combines a film studio with a
theme park featuring the Chinese architectural style of the Tang
era 1,300 years ago.
   Organized by Hong Kong entrepreneur Deacon Chiu, developers of
the $26 million movie town and cultural display plan to turn out an
average of three films a year.
   To lure producers, the government's Economic Development Board
offers tax holidays and other incentives. EDB Chairman Philip Yeo
expects a comprehensive film industry to evolve around the infant
studios, which will need processing laboratories, post-production
houses and a pool of actors and technicians.
   Some observers say Singapore's move is shrewd because China's
takeover of Hong Kong in 1997 is likely to spark an exodus of some
members of the British colony's booming film industry. Another
factor is the possibility that movies made in Taiwan might be
barred from Hong Kong after 1997.
   At first glance, this island republic of 2.6 million people
would seem an unlikely spot to produce films, particularly those
aimed in part at local viewers.
   Censorship is heavy-handed and the makers of some award-winning
movies have refused to release them rather than submit to cuts.
``Platoon,'' Oliver Stone's haunting portrait of the Vietnam War
which won four Oscars and three Golden Globes, was withdrawn in
1987.
   ``A representative from the Board of Film Censors demanded 28
cuts,'' said Arnold Kopelson, a producer. ``The irony of this issue
is that anyone can purchase the uncut version in the form of a
pirated cassette.''
   Illegal ``pirate'' video tapes of most productions are not as
widespread as a few years ago. But in the early 1980s once-avid
fans turned away from the silver screen in droves to watch movies
at home.
   The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) Statistical Yearbook once listed Singaporeans as the
world's leading filmgoers, averaging on a per capita basis about 19
visits to the movies each year. The Soviets were second with an
average 18 visits a year.
   Attendance dropped from a peak of 46.1 million in 1979, when
videocassette fever hit, to 19.5 million in 1986. Half of the 80
cinemas doing a brisk business 10 years ago have closed.
   Mandarin, Malay, English and Tamil are the official languages.
Chinese feature films now come mostly from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Tamil and Hindi films come from India and Malay films from
Indonesia and Malaysia. English-language films originate in the
United States, Britain and Italy.
   Viewers are not confined to specific ethnic groups since most of
the offerings are subtitled in one or two other languages.

<BYLINE>BY MARCO WERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OUAGADOUGU, Burkina Faso (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine a film director forced
to kill off a character he couldn't afford to take along to the
next shoot. That happened to Idrissa Ouedraogo while he was filming
his award-winning ``Yam Daabo'' (``The Choice'').
   Imagine a filmmaker who has to wait two to three weeks to see
rushes, while they are sent to Europe for processing.
   Problems such as these confront African producers as they seek
to compete with Hollywood and the rest of the world in the movie
industry.
   That Ouedraogo and other African producers have won several
awards and a small following in the United States and Europe in
recent years indicates there are diamonds in an emerging industry
riddled with problems and contradictions.
   Ouedraogo won the 1987 Pan African film festival's prize in
cinematography for his ``Yam Daabo.'' Malian producer Souleymane
Cisee's ``Yeelen'' won the the Prix du Jury at the 1987 Cannes Film
Festival. The movie also received critical acclaim at the New York
Film Festival that year. Senegalese producer Ousmane Sembene won
the 1988 Grand Prize of the jury at the 1988 Mostra Venice festival.
   ``For a lot of people in Europe and the States _ people who
don't travel _ the cinema is an evasion, and Africa is a new
world,'' Ouedraogo said. ``But there also is the discovery, or
should I say rediscovery, of human values, relationships and
sentiments. These human themes have yet to be abandoned in a large
number of African films and are themes that are still fresh for
us.''
   The pace of these films can be slow, perhaps magnifying the
universal themes that anchor them: marital infidelity, power and
corruption. ``Yam Daabo'' follows a family driven from the land by
drought and its problems.
   Patrick Ilboudo, a Burkinabe journalist, has written a book
chronicling how African producers have come this far. It is a
history of the Pan African film festival held every other year in
this dusty Sahel town.
   Independence left aspiring African film producers with balky old
equipment, where any was available at all, Ilboudo said. The
filmmakers also inherited a film genre that regarded Africans as
savage, illiterate natives who were always dancing to drumbeats.
   ``When the Africans first started making films seriously in the
1960s, they felt obliged to rehabilitate a bastardized image of the
black man,'' said Ilboudo.
   Although the filmmakers have mellowed, they remain among the
elite in their countries and usually have a statement to make, says
French film editor Andree Davanture, who has worked on some of the
best.
   ``Every film that is made in Africa is a sacrifice for the
population. ... So if a film is made, it must be well done ... to
generate other films,'' said Ouedraogo.
   Finance is the biggest obstacle. Films shown at this year's
African film festival cost an average of $1 million, peanuts by
Western standards. But for countries unable to pay off their debts,
making movies is a luxury.
   African films are largely financed by the government of the
filmmaker, or depend heavily on joint ventures with cultural
cooperation programs of France, Holland, West Germany, Belgium and
Switzerland.
   Filmmakers in this land-locked West African nation, which is
fighting the advance of the Sahara and ranked as the world's third
poorest by the World Bank, have the enthusiastic support of their
government and are considered among the most productive in black
Africa. They annually turn out one or two films.
   Kwah Ansah, a filmmaker from Ghana, said his prize-winning
``Heritage of Africa'' would be his last. He had to go into debt to
make it, and is using the prize money to pay bills.
   African filmmakers also are limited by materials and a poorly
trained crew. Ouedraogo says lack of training is the main problem.
   But only by making many pictures can the crew learn the tricks
of the trade.
   ``In the area of technique _ lighting, sound, filming editing _
you simply have to make an enormous amount of films to multiply
your experiences. You can't go to school to learn these things. We
don't have many productions so it is hard to accumulate the
experiences,'' Ouedraogo said.
   Technical problems slow down the productions. After each can of
film was shot while Ouedraogo was filming his new release,
``Yaaba'' (Grandmother), it had to be immediately transported five
hours south to refrigerators in Ouagadougu to avoid the heat and
dust, and then shipped to labs in Europe for processing. By the
time the rushes had returned, several weeks later, much momentum
and motivation were lost.
   Film editor Davanture says the shortage of trained personnel
also can create artistic obstacles: ``If an entire country has only
one qualified camera operator, imagine the difficulties that can
arise if the communication is poor between him and the director.''
   Still another problem is the writing. ``Hollywood understands
more than any other film complex that everything rests on the
screenplay. Even many filmmakers do not yet understand this and
Africans are just beginning to realize it,'' said Ouedrago. ``Yam
Daabo'' was shot without a screenplay.
   If all the other obstacles are surmounted, the producers still
must get the films distributed. It's impossible to compete against
films from developed countries.
   ``The African films don't even have a chance in Africa,'' said
exiled South African filmmaker Lionel N'Gakane. ``The cinema owners
are usually not African and they, too, are not interested in
African films because they don't make any money.''

<HEAD>90,000 Foreign Workers Easing East German Labor Shortage</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While West Germans struggle with growing hostility
toward foreign workers, East Germans have happily opened the door
to them.
   By official count, 90,000 Vietnamese, Angolans, Cubans,
Mozambicans, North Koreans and Chinese are at work in East Germany.
About 70,000 are Vietnamese.
   With the longest standard work week in Europe _ 44 hours _ and
every pair of hands already employed, the East Germans concede that
to improve their economic prowess they need a little help from
friends.
   The foreigners take the least desirable and lowest-paying jobs,
often working the night shift to turn out light bulbs in Plauen or
shipping containers in Rostock.
   Some spend free hours tailoring jeans outfits and custom-made
clothing for black-market sales to which East Berlin officials
deliberately turn their backs.
   ``We have to achieve higher production with an absolutely
declining population, and we have temporarily found a solution by
using Vietnamese manpower,'' said Ekkehard Sachse, a leading
government economics adviser. ``Naturally we have had some
assimilation problems, but the end result has been very
satisfying.''
   Foreign workers have been brought in for more than a decade to
balance the loss of working-age East Germans to emigration and a
steadily falling birthrate.
   But officials have only recently begun to acknowledge the extent
of the foreign presence and their contribution to the East German
economy, already the most prosperous in Eastern Europe.
   The state-run television network broadcast a 40-minute
documentary in early April explaining the advantages of imported
labor for East German society. The program aired twice during prime
viewing hours appeared aimed at fostering positive attitudes toward
the foreigners and diluting resentment over the strains they put on
short supplies of housing and certain consumer goods, such as
sewing machines and bicycles.
   ``Vietnam is very happy with this solution, as it solves some of
their economic problems,'' said Sachse, head of the demographics
department at East Germany's College of Economics. ``The Vietnamese
working in East Germany send money and consumer goods home. We
estimate they are improving the lifestyles of about a million
people there.''
   Sachse said the level of foreign workers will grow through the
year 1995, but that authorities hope to avoid a long-term
dependence on imported labor.
   ``We don't want to have millions of foreign workers here,''
Sachse said, noting that most of those working in East Germany are
single, but a long-term dependence would mean providing permanent
housing and social services for foreign families.
   Guest workers are officially limited to five-year stints, and
most live in dormitories or communal housing provided by the
factories and enterprises where they are assigned to work.
   Many West Germans fear about 4 million guest workers in their
country _ more than half of them from Turkey _ contribute to West
Germany's 8 percent unemployment rate, but East Germans view the
foreigners as potential relief for their overburdened work force.
   East Germany, along with its 44-hour work week, has full
employment of working-age men and 92 percent of working-age women,
according to a government study published late last year.
   Sachse said in an interview that the pressure on women to work
contributes to the steady decline in births and to the nation's
astounding divorce rate. An estimated two-thirds of all marriages
in East Germany are eventually dissolved.
   An average of 2.3 children per couple is needed to maintain the
current population of 16.7 million, but the latest statistics
indicate the average is 1.9 and falling, Sachse said.
   He also confirmed Western estimates that the population dropped
by about 20,000 last year because of legal emigration to the West,
which is expected to continue at its current level for at least a
few more years.
   Western diplomats said 40,000 East Germans were granted
permission to emigrate to the West in 1988, and that an estimated
200,000 others have applied to leave.
   Automation improvements in some industries have eased the burden
on a shrinking work force under growing pressure to produce more to
satisfy both domestic and export needs. But a chronic labor
shortage persists, prompting East Germany to turn to its allies for
additional help.
   While both East German and Western officials describe the import
of foreign workers as a mostly positive influence on East German
society, the effort has not been problem-free.
   East German media reports have alluded to incidents of
inter-racial strife, including a February article in Dresden's
Saechsische Zeitung reporting prison terms for two East Germans who
pushed a worker from Mozambique in Africa from a moving train.
   Officials contend racial incidents are rare, but concede that
tensions run high over the foreign workers' tendency to buy up
desirable consumer goods to take back home with them.
   East Germany and Czechoslovakia enjoy a considerably higher
standard of living than their communist neighbors in Europe and
allies in Africa and Southeast Asia.
   Both nations slapped higher export tariffs on consumer goods at
the first of the year to stem the outward flow of the most
sought-after items, like bicycles, small appliances, shoes and
better-quality clothing.

<HEAD>Tourism Head Wants Geneva to Liven Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CYRIL TUOHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diplomats and other negotiators from all over the
world constantly fill up Geneva's hotels and restaurants, but
ordinary tourists apparently find the place dull.
   Tourism in Geneva has been falling since 1984 and Olivier Vodoz,
head of the Geneva tourist office, believes it's time to liven
things up.
   ``Geneva must provide non-stop cultural, artistic, and athletic
events,'' he said. ``We have to organize large concerts, both
classical and rock, which will attract young people.''
   He thinks the city of 160,000 permanent residents suffers from
its staid image.
   ``Seventy percent of the people who are considered tourists are
either businessmen, representatives to international organizations,
or delegates attending conferences,'' he said. ``The other 30
percent are people simply passing through.''
   With 270 restaurants _ many of them catering to the
expense-account crowd _ a tourist office pamphlet describes Geneva
as ``one of the world's gastronomic capitals.'' But most prices are
out of reach for the backpack crowd. Geneva also has 39 discos and
night clubs but many require membership.
   Vodoz noted that chronic traffic congestion dissuades motorist
travelers from stopping in Geneva, which has one of the world's
highest automobile densities. In order to alleviate that problem,
the city is increasing its number of parking places.
   High hotel prices _ $225 a night for a single at a plush
lakeside hotel _ also are listed as contributing to the decline in
tourist business in continental Europe's second most expensive
city, trailing Copenhagen, Denmark.
   ``With the help of the hoteliers we have made efforts to try to
reduce prices but we can still do more,'' Vodoz said.
   Some relief is expected from the recent weakening of the Swiss
franc against the dollar and other major currencies, and tourist
officials hope the forecasts of higher crude oil prices will mean a
return of free-spending Arabs.
   But while it attempts to attract more tourists, Geneva will
definitely not change its cityscape, Vodoz said.
   ``As a result the city may appear less exciting or dynamic than
other cities. We will never become a Hong Kong or a Monaco.''

<TEXT>
   Yo, James Brown! You may be sitting in jail,
but your soul's on the loose in all kinds of songs, thanks to rap's
booming use of a musical borrowing technique called sampling.
   Mixing a hunger for instant recognition with a disregard for
copyright law, rappers are exploiting sophisticated electronics to
lift drum beats, guitar riffs and vocal phrases from old songs and
plunk them into their new works.
   Through digital sampling, for example, rapper L.L. Cool J
dresses up a song with Chuck Berry's guitar licks.
   Both sampling and rap are so popular that lawyers are loading up
their litigation bags to handle the potential barrage of copyright
lawsuits. At the heart of the debate is whether rap is a legally
protected, hip-hopping art form or just high-tech cattle rustling.
   ``I don't see any protection for (sampling) anywhere, ever,''
said Peter Paterno, a music industry attorney whose clients include
Guns N' Roses. ``I think every one of these guys who samples is
going to lose (in court).''
   Ricky Grundy, co-president and owner of Graffiti Talk Music,
says there should be compensation for sampling. ``The (rappers) are
not being creative. They're using other talent to make up an
idea,'' he said.
   Indeed, Frank Zappa now puts this warning on his rock albums:
``Unauthorized reproduction-sampling is a violation of applicable
laws and subject to criminal prosecution.''
   Yet rappers and their supporters insist that this pop-culture
pastiche represents rap's essence. Without sampling, they insist,
there wouldn't be any raps worth rapping.
   ``That's a part of rap _ sampling,'' said Tone Loc, whose ``Wild
Thing'' includes bits from Van Halen's ``Jamie's Crying,'' and
whose ``Funky Cold Medina'' appropriates parts of Foreigner's ``Hot
Blooded.''
   ``You bring back old songs that you might have forgot about or
never heard before. When you hear the little riff, that little tune
in your head, it starts coming back to you, and it sounds good,''
said Loc, one of the few rappers who seeks permission for most of
his musical raids. ``We don't have live musicians to play for us. I
never had a live drummer.''
   Today's digital technology reduces even the most complicated,
multi-layered songs to individual data bits. Thus, a single
tambourine hit from a '40s classic that has been digitally
rerecorded can be electronically extracted with surgical precision.
It can then be stored in a computer for use with other music
without missing a beat.
   Discovering musical samples in current rap songs, therefore, can
be a bit like Easter-egg hunts: some can't be missed; others
require a painstaking search.
   De La Soul's ``Eye Know'' borrows from Steely Dan's ``Peg'' and
Otis Redding's ``(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay.'' G-Love-E's
``Suck on This'' contains a sequence from Three Dog Night's ``Mama
Told Me (Not to Come).'' Several years ago, the English band
Frankie Goes to Hollywood's ``Relax'' repeatedly reused a
two-second drum sequence from a 1969 Led Zeppelin album.
   But the biggest source of this digital dredging is James Brown,
now serving a six-year sentence in South Carolina for aggravated
assault and failing to stop for police.
   Brown's work has been replayed by the Fat Boys, Ice-T, Public
Enemy and a host of other rappers. ``The music out there is only as
good as my last record,'' Brown joked in a recent interview from
jail with Rolling Stone magazine.
   While an increasing number of rappers are following Tone Loc's
lead by obtaining rights and paying fees of several hundred dollars
for each sample, many do not. The Beastie Boys, for one, are facing
a copyright infringement suit over their song ``Hold It Now, Hit
It.'' The case could be the first to establish a legal precedent
for future sampling disputes.
   It is alleged that the Beastie Boys _ who sample the ``Psycho''
film score on their upcoming album _ lifted the words ``Yo Leroy''
and some drum beats from Jimmy Castor's 1977 single, ``The Return
of Leroy (Part One).''
   Chuck Ortner, a lawyer representing Beastie Boys label Def Jam
Recordings, said that even if the rappers did sample from Castor,
which he disputes, the band is protected in part by the Fair Use
doctrine of the 1976 Copyright Act, the same doctrine that allows a
college professor to photocopy a short article for a class.
   ``People who create rap music ...(are) basically using tapes and
discs and records as musical instruments themselves,'' Ortner said.
``And ... they should be as free to do that as if they were
actually playing a conventional instrument. If there is a blanket
rule prohibiting this kind of activity, then it will seriously
impede the development of this kind of music.''
   Yet when one of Ortner's own clients was sampled by the group
Blue Mercedes not long ago, he didn't hesitate to bring action
against MCA Records, resulting in a favorable settlement for
Ortner's client, the band M-A-R-R-S. The difference between that
case and the Beastie Boys', he said, is that Blue Mercedes' sample
was far too lengthy to let pass.
   But the logical extension of Ortner's Fair Use defense, said
Paul Goldstein, a professor of copyright law at Stanford Law
School, is that a filmmaker could make a movie out of a popular
book such as ``Gone With the Wind'' without paying royalties.
   So how will the dispute be resolved? Ortner and some lawyers
suggest a sliding fee scale in which rappers would pay a few cents
(or less) on the sale of each record featuring sampling.
   ``The sampling and the use of somebody's prior material ... is
something I have no objection to,'' said Jay Morgenstern, executive
vice president and general manager of music publishing giant
Warner-Chappell Music. ``But if you're going to use somebody else's
material, you should pay them a fair amount for it.
   ``All I have requested of the people who do it is be honest and
fair: Tell us before you do it. We'll make an arrangement with you
whereby a royalty will be paid and due credit will be given.''
   Beyond its financial and legal impact, sampling also might be
impeding the skills of a new generation of musicians.
   ``I have a nephew. I tried to teach him guitar. And he said,
`Later for that,''' said Rick Skatore, a bassist with the New York
band 24-7 Spyz. ``He likes the beat box, that little Casio thing
where you press a button and it plays the beat.
   ``And I ran across another young kid _ his father has been a
guitar player all his life _ and the kid said, `I don't like
playing music, having to learn it. I'd rather sample it. I like
instant gratification.' And I said, `Wow.'''

   When the price of gasoline here rises, or
the cost of a pizza falls, Wall Street and Washington listen.
   A filling station and a pizza parlor in this far suburb of
Washington are among the 19,000 businesses nationwide that are
surveyed every month _ along with 57,000 homes _ for the tiny bits
of information that combine to make up the Consumer Price Index.
   The report, receiving extra attention now that price increases
are accelerating, is the definitive statement on inflation in
America and reflects what people pay for everything from McIntosh
apples to Macintosh computers.
   Its influence affects the decisions of government policymakers
and Wall Street investors, wages and benefits for millions of
Americans, school lunch prices and even federal income tax brackets.
   At a local gasoline station visited monthly by a part-time Labor
Deprtment worker, the manager is nonchalant about his role in
compiling one of the government's most important economic
indicators.
   ``They gotta use somebody,'' he shrugged during a recent visit
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics checker. ``Our place is as good
as any. I got nothin' to hide.''
   Premium unleaded was $1.28 a gallon, up seven cents from April.
   BLS field manager Vera Mitchell, filling in for the part-time
employee who regularly checks prices in suburban Washington,
listened politely while the manager rambled on about how fuels
containing alcohol can ``mess up your car,'' then headed for an
auto dealership.
   There, she waited again. The sales manager had temporarily
vanished.
   ``He goes on a brisk walk around the lot this time of day,''
explained a fellow salesman.
   The sales manager reappeared and gave her information on an auto
he proudly described as ``a sport utility vehicle on steroids.''
The price of the identical vehicle is checked at that dealership
every other month.
   Nationwide, 400 part-time agents track the costs of sets of
items in seven major groups _ food, housing, apparel,
transportation, medical care, entertainment and the catchall
``other goods and services,'' which ranges from haircuts to
cigarettes.
   Prices on roughly 100,000 items in 85 metropolitan areas are
averaged and weighted according to their importance in calculating
the index for urban consumers, which covers 80 percent of the U.S.
population.
   In March, the most recent month for which figures were
available, prices rose 0.5 percent. The index stood at 122.3
percent of its 1982-84 base, meaning that a hypothetical selection
of goods and services costing $100 in the base period would have
cost $122.30 in March.
   The Labor Department does not allow public disclosure of the
exact businesses, individuals and items surveyed for the index,
which costs $28 million a year to compile.
   Ms. Mitchell, who herself once worked part time gathering prices
for the government, said business people generally are cooperative
even though their participation is unrewarded except for a
thank-you letter at the end of five years, when a new set of items
and stores is selected.
   ``They don't have to sell me anything and they don't have to buy
or refuse to buy anything from me,'' she said. ``I'm probably one
of the least pressuring people that walk in there.''
   From the car dealership, she headed for a grocery store to
survey prices on a dozen items. Radishes were on sale at five bags
for 89 cents, prompting Ms. Mitchell to wonder ``what one would do
with five packages of radishes?''
   Next on the itinerary was a pizza parlor, where she waited once
again while a one-man crew juggled the hungry lunchtime crowd.
   Prices were down. A plain medium pizza was selling for $6.99,
compared with $8.20 at the last visit. The manager's explanation
for the price cuts: ``competition.''
   Ms. Mitchell said conducting price surveys has made her more
savvy about getting good buys, especially on cars. But she added
that, ``after a while, there's such an overload of information you
don't remember anything.''
   Data on housing costs is gathered from visits to thousands of
renters and homeowners, which is where Ms. Mitchell said she became
``conversant with many dogs'' who more typically prey on mail
carriers.
   The housing survey sends the price surveyers into all sorts of
neighborhoods, including areas that have gotten ``less
comfortable'' as violent crime rises, she said.
   ``I've met some mighty gutsy people living there and raising
their kids,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ``You may go from a really poor
neighborhood to a really posh neighborhood. To see them smack up
against one another, it's just hard to look at.''
   Recent CPI reports indicate inflation has racheted upward from
the 4.4 percent levels registered in 1987 and 1988. For the first
quarter of 1989, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 6.1
percent; another sharp increase is expected when April's report is
released Thursday.
   The recent acceleration in the CPI has come despite a yearlong
campaign by the Federal Reserve Board to ease inflationary
pressures by pushing up interest rates and restraining economic
growth.
   The persistent price increases, occurring even as the economy
shows signs of slowing, have some analysts worried that the central
bank may tighten credit so much to arrest inflation that the
Federal Reserve unintentionally pushes the country into a recession.
   Others believe the Fed will be able to engineer a ``soft
landing,'' in which growth slows enough to rein in the escalating
CPI without snuffing out the nation's 6-year-old economic expansion.
   While many people are aware of the inflation index's influence
on monetary policy, few realize that fluctuations in the CPI can
directly affect their own wages, benefits and taxes, said Patrick
Jackman, head of the Labor Department's CPI branch.
   Wage increases for 3 million workers covered by union contracts
are tied to the index, as are school lunch charges for 24 million
youngsters and benefits levels for 38 million Social Security
beneficiaries, 3 million federal retirees and survivors, and 19
million food stamp recipients.
   In addition, the CPI is used to adjust the federal income tax
structure to prevent ``bracket creep,'' inflation-induced increases
in tax rates.
   ``Virtually everybody who earns any income is potentially
affected by the CPI,'' Jackman said.
   Because the monthly CPI report can send financial markets diving
or soaring, the figure is a closely guarded secret until its
release at precisely 8:30 a.m. on a weekday in the middle of the
following month.
   Ms. Mitchell, fresh from her latest canvass of prices, said that
when the figure finally reaches the headlines, she ``knows the
reality of where it's coming from.''

<TEXT>
   A herd of llamas and alpacas en route
to the United States from the cold high Andes of Chile have been
stranded for seven weeks in the heat of a barren Caribbean island.
   Seventy-five of the woolly beasts have perished, mostly from the
heat and stress.
   The 178 survivors are awaiting delivery to American buyers as
trendy pets, pack animals or breeding stock in a $2-million export
deal.
   But they have been held up by U.S. regulations on foot-and-mouth
disease and have become the center of a feud involving
animal-welfare activists, the Antiguan government and the U.S.
investors.
   In all, 268 llamas and alpacas were shipped, but 15 died in a
crating accident aboard a Bolivian cargo plane on takeoff from
Chile.
   After the remaining 253 arrived in the twin nation of Antigua
and Barbuda, about 250 miles east of Puerto Rico, residents
protesting their presence on Barbuda blocked a quarantine station
and forced the herd onto uninhabited Billy Island off Antigua.
   ``Straight from the beginning it was a fiasco,'' said John
Walsh, regional director in Boston of the London-based World
Society for the Protection of Animals, which monitors the
commercial use of animals. ``In my view, it shows a lack of concern
for the animals.''
   At one stage, the beasts, which belong to the camel family but
have no hump, were dying at a rate of two a day on Billy Island, a
hill of coral rock, scrub brush and a few scrawny trees.
   Because llamas and alpacas live above the treeline in the Andes,
they have no instinct to seek shade and succumbed in temperatures
hitting the mid-80s.
   ``They really were just dropping like flies because of the
heat,'' said John Schartner, a scuba-diving instructor hired to
camp out on the island and care for the animals. ``They didn't know
enough to get in the shade. Most of them would just lie out and
bake in the sun.''
   Since then, workers have built shelters with blue plastic
tarpaulins to shade the herd, and set up a supply line of hay and
fresh water brought from Antigua in 55-gallon drums. Intravenous
tubes and spray pumps were used to rehydrate the animals.
   Paula Vachon of Sarasota, Fla., one of the four partners in the
export deal who has been supervising the operation in Antigua, said
only one animal had died this month _ a llama with a leg cut that
got infected.
   The llamas and alpacas were brought to Antigua and Barbuda,
about 250 miles east of Puerto Rico, by two Florida businessmen,
David Strickland and Keith Kerr. Another partner is Kerr's wife,
Diane.
   Strickland, a Sarasota developer, has been doing business in
Antigua and Barbuda for 17 years. Kerr, who owns a construction
company in Palmetto, Fla., has a 12-acre private zoo that includes
lions, tigers, cougars, bears, wolves, bobcats and an 8-year-old
elephant.
   Strickland said the partners bought the exotic creatures in
Chile for $50 to $120 each and hoped to sell them for $6,500 to
$15,000 each. The deal would have netted a profit of around $2
million, he said.
   The International Llama Association estimates there are 25,000
llamas and 1,000 of the smaller alpacas in the United States.
   In recent years, the graceful, mild-natured creatures with
thick, woolly coats, have become increasingly popular and valuable.
Males typically sell for $10,000 and breeding females $30,000, but
prices vary greatly. A prize stud reportedly sold for $115,000 last
year.
   Strickland said the idea was to export llamas and alpacas to pay
for both a wildlife park in Antigua and a $450,000 quarantine
station the investors built on Barbuda.
   The project went awry when a barge carrying the llamas and
alpacas arrived off Barbuda on March 23. An unruly crowd formed and
refused to allow the vessel to unload.
   Underlying the protest was local hostility to a cement company
Strickland owns with Deputy Prime Minister Lester Bird of Antigua
and two other Cabinet ministers. The company uses sand from Barbuda
in construction.
   The main problem for the animals now is that the exporters
shipped them from Chile and brought them to Antigua, and neither
country is regarded by the U.S. government as free of
foot-and-mouth disease, a contagious virus that can devastate
livestock.
   The animals have been inspected by a veterinarian from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, but they cannot enter the United States
without undergoing a 90-day quarantine. The only approved facility,
the Harry S. Truman Animal Import Center in Fleming Key, Fla., is
booked through the end of September with a shipment of Chinese pigs.
   Llama association president Fred Bauer accused the exporters of
trying to circumvent USDA regulations by setting up an unauthorized
quarantine station. ``Nothing seems to ring quite true with this
deal,'' he said.
   Francie Stull, who raises Russian wolfhounds near Austin, Texas,
bought 160 of the animals from the Florida investors for more than
$1 million and has already pre-sold 49 of them for about $500,000.
   She said she was unaware until this past September that Antigua
had not done the necessary screening to be declared free of
foot-and-mouth disease but had been assured there would be no
problem in obtaining the status.
   Asked what was likely to happen to the animals, she said: ``My
best guess is that they will be put in some kind of facility where
they are comfortable and be used as a breeder herd for the next
couple of years while we negotiate the red tape.''
   Mrs. Stull said she had fully insured her animals, but
Strickland said the rest of the herd was not covered. He said the
partners stood to lose $1.3 million if the animals cannot be
brought into the United States.
   The government here has agreed to allow construction of another
quarantine station, this one on a peninsula of Antigua, along with
the promised wildlife park as a tourist attraction.
   ``We don't want these animals to suffer anymore,'' said
government spokesman Barry Stevens. ``They've been brought here,
and there's nowhere else for the them to go. Now, we've got to
salvage the situation.''

   Women like Monique Ralaimandy
and Vero Rasendratsirofo are leading this Indian Ocean nation off
Africa out of its isolation and into the economic mainstream.
   Ralaimandy, trained as an electronics engineer, lost her job in
1974 when President Didier Ratsiraka embarked on a socialist
revolution and closed a U.S. satellite tracking station.
   ``There were no jobs after it closed so I started making
dolls,'' said Ralaimandy.
   She has since branched out from dolls and now has a workshop
that employs 300 and produces nearly 1,000 dresses a week for sale
in France. In April month she started a second shift.
   ``When I started banks wouldn't help me,'' she said. ``Now I
have a banker as a financial adviser.''
   Operating in a couple of sheds surrounded by frangipani and
oleander, Vero Rasendratsirofo is producing ceramic pots, dishes,
vases, piggy banks and ornamental items.
   She employs 11 young men and two women at her establishment,
called Atelier Vero, and has a hard time keeping up with demand.
Last year she won the ``Oscar,'' the island's top award for
handicrafts.
   Finance Minister Pascal Rakotomavo said the success of these and
other female entrepreneurs ``is a very encouraging sign.''
   U.S. Ambassador Patricia Gates Lynch said, ``I have been
impressed by the initiative and ability of Malagasy women to
organize and run a business. There are still many poor people. It
will take several years before some of the new enterprises will
benefit everyone, but there is a spirit of hope in the air.''
   Madagascar, formerly the Malagasy Republic, is one of the
world's poorest countries, with an annual per capita income of $163.
   Why are women taking the lead in setting up small industries?
   ``That's the big question,'' said Vero Rasendratsirofo's mother,
Elyett. ``Maybe it's cultural. Girls learn to be in charge very
early, taking care of their brothers and sisters. They fight
harder. But you know, I am a woman.''
   Monique Ralimandy quickly moved from making and selling dolls in
1978 to decorating homes and offices.
   In 1986 she took a collection of dolls and baskets to France to
test export opportunities. She sold out and got help from French
and Canadian agencies to set up workshops.
   ``I didn't know the technique, only the design,'' she said. As
she couldn't produce on a large scale she looked for a niche and
found a good market for ``elaborately designed, not cheap, but
affordable clothes for young girls.''
   Most Malagasy women learn to sew as small children so labor was
no problem, but the competition from other countries made quality
control essential.
   ``They have to get it into their heads that quality comes
first,'' Ralimandy said.
   Ralimandy's brother, a doctor, visits daily to provide free
medical examinations. Some of the women earn 70,000 Malagasy francs
monthly ($45), twice the minimum wage, depending on their output.
They are not required to work every day.
   Workers at Atelier Vero also work as they please to a degree.
   ``Our people are farmers at heart and some leave during the
harvest season,'' said Vero Rasendratsirofo.
   She hopes to expand and sell her ceramic ware to other Indian
Ocean islands.
   Monique Ralimandy is optimistic about Madagascar's future.
   ``There is great potential in Madagascar for the export of
confections,'' she said. ``Two years ago we thought there was no
future for textiles.''

<HEAD>Movie Studios Jockey for Summer Release Dates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   With one eye on the audience and another on the
competition, movie executives continue to shuffle summer release
dates, confident that last-minute feints and gambits will bring
their films the largest possible box office.
   Patrick Swayze's ``Road House,'' once set for February and then
June, has previewed to test audiences so well it now will launch
the summer sweepstakes on May 19, a week before Harrison Ford
appears in ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''
   Another former June release, Clint Eastwood's ``Pink Cadillac,''
has moved to May 26, thereby avoiding a clash with ``Ghostbusters
II.'' Meanwhile, the new James Bond movie, ``License to Kill'' with
Timothy Dalton, and ``Lethal Weapon II'' with Mel Gibson, are
heading for a July 14 showdown.
   In perhaps the season's bloodiest duel, Paramount Pictures and
New Line Cinema are juggling the August openings of their
respective horror films ``Friday the 13th Part VIII'' and
``Nightmare on Elm Street 5,'' hopeful that the first to debut will
make the biggest turnstile killing.
   Since a strong summer can make a movie company's entire year,
the studios have stockpiled their most commercial films for the
coming months. The resulting cinematic gridlock means that some
distributors have completely fled the summer, saving their better
projects for less crowded times.
   ``There may not be as many titles in sheer bulk, but in quality
of titles going in, this summer is as competitive as we have
seen,'' said Barry London, president of Paramount's motion picture
group.
   Nevertheless, independent distributor Hemdale believes there's
room for stylish foreign film such as England's ``Shag.''
   ``The blockbusters ... are fantasies,'' said Martin Rabinovitch,
Hemdale's executive vice president in charge of marketing.
``They're not about real things that happen. So audiences will be
ready for a real, personal film such as `Shag.'''
   By releasing ``Indiana Jones'' as the first of the would-be
blockbusters, Paramount could control some of the nation's best
movie screens and dominate the entire summer campaign.
   Besides ``Indiana Jones,'' three others will open virtually
unopposed: ``Pink Cadillac'' and ``Star Trek V: The Final
Frontier'' on June 9, and ``Ghostbusters II'' on June 16. The
much-talked about ``Batman,'' opening June 23, will be combating
only one lesser title, the light comedy ``Honey, I've Shrunk the
Kids.''
   ``But at some point, you can't move out of the way and you have
to open in the face of some other competition, because you want to
be in the summer, and take advantage of the holiday audience,''
said Si Kornblit, Universal Picture's executive vice president of
worldwide marketing. Universal's ``Renegades,'' starring Lou
Diamond Phillips, will open on June 2 amid a firestorm of other
major releases.
   Since the average moviegoer rarely sees two films in one
weekend, it's crucial that releases be scattered evenly and that
similar films never open against one another. Thus, studios watch
their rivals with undivided attention: The wrong release date can
kill even the biggest mass-appeal project.
   ``If one studio makes a change, the other follows,'' said John
Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. ``It's checkers.''
   New Line, distributors of the Hulk Hogan action-adventure film
``No Holds Barred,'' knows all about that kind of gamesmanship.
``We were going to open `No Holds Barred' on Memorial Day weekend,
when it was just `Indiana Jones' and that's all,'' said Mitchell
Goldman, New Line's distribution president. ``But when Warner Bros.
decided to move in there with their Clint Eastwood film, and Fox
and MGM threw in a picture, we decided to drop back a week.''
   In one of the season's more fearless moves, Orion will present
``Great Balls of Fire,'' a movie about rocker Jerry Lee Lewis, on
June 30. That's the opening day for ``The Karate Kid III'' with
Ralph Macchio, one of summer's most anticipated titles, and the
debut of Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing.''
   ``What we have that nobody else has is an absolute original, the
only musical in the marketplace,'' said Charles Glenn, executive
vice president of marketing for Orion, which will distribute
``Great Balls of Fire.''
   ``If you go to a multiplex theater and they're showing `Karate
Kid' and `Batman'... you have another choice: a picture that's
different, that's rock and roll.''
   Showing similar daring, Cinecom will introduce its comedy,
``Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills,'' on May 31,
halfway between ``Indiana Jones'' and ``Star Trek V.''
   Late summer is loaded with serious movies such as the underwater
extravaganza ``The Abyss'' and a variety of other action-adventure
titles, so Universal is banking that audiences will crave a
spirited comedy such as Ron Howard's ``Parenthood,'' starring Steve
Martin and opening Aug. 11.
   ``Some of the summer blockbusters will play through the summer.
But they will be on the decline,'' said Universal's Kornblit.
``After a rash of `License to Kill' and `Lethal Weapon II,'' we're
going to come in with some great counter-programming. And we think
(``Parenthood'') will be the big movie at the end of the summer.''

   Retail sales rose by a lackluster 0.4 percent
in April, the government said in a report cited by analysts as
evidence that higher interest rates are taking a toll on economic
growth.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday sales climbed to a
seasonally adjusted $139.9 billion last month after remaining flat
in March and falling 0.4 percent in February.
   Economists had expected a much stronger rebound in April,
anticipating a surge of between 1 percent and 2 percent on the
strength of higher auto sales.

   Depositors withdrew a net $8.5 billion from
the nation's savings and loans in March, the government says. The
outflow was more than $2 billion below January's record, but still
considered very large.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Thursday the March outflow
compared with $9.2 billion in February and a record $10.8 billion
in January. It was the 11th month of withdrawals in a row and the
fifth of withdrawals in excess of $7 billion.

   Bush insists that the minimum should be raised only to $4.25 by

pay a lower ``training wage'' to new workers for six months.

   The chairman of the American Stock Exchange says
he will leave the nation's third-largest stock market ``stronger
than ever'' when he steps down to try to build a large
communications company.
   Arthur Levitt Jr. announced Thursday he was resigning after 11
years at the exchange, which has attempted to stem the loss of
business to its bigger Wall Street competitors by expanding into
innovative new securities.
   Levitt, 58, said he would remain at the exchange until a
successor was named and that a search committee had been formed. He
said he plans to expand his three-year-old Levitt Communications
Inc.
   ``I believe the American Exchange today is stronger than ever in
its history,'' Levitt told a news conference at the exchange in
Lower Manhattan. ``I believe the staff is better, the quality of
listed companies is stronger.''
   The Amex, which caters to medium-sized companies, is far
outpaced in volume by the New York Stock Exchange and the National
Association of Securities Dealers' over-the-counter market traded
electronically nationwide.
   The Amex grew from an average daily volume of 3.9 million shares
traded when Levitt took over in 1978 to 9.94 million shares last
year, but the number of companies traded has fallen from 1,004 to
895 currently.
   The exchange dates to the 1790s, when its brokers traded
unlisted securities on the streets of lower Manhattan while others
moved indoors. It was known as the New York Curb Exchange until
1953, when its present name was adopted.
   Levitt said he would enlarge Levitt Communications, which has
revenue of about $16 million and owns 33-year-old Roll Call, a
twice-weekly Washington newspaper delivered to the White House and
98 percent of the nation's congressmen.
   The company in April agreed to acquire B&amp;B Enterprises Inc.,
which owns the publisher of Stagebill, a magazine distributed at
performing arts centers in New York and Washington.
   Levitt, president of a Shearson Lehman Hutton predecessor,
Shearson Hayden Stone Inc., from 1969-78, said he planned other
media aquisitions, and ``quite possibly'' would seek to enter daily
print journalism.
   ``Art has been doing this for 11 years. I think he's
accomplished the goals he set out for himself,'' said Jeffrey B.
Lane, an Amex board member and president of Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.. ``I think he's leaving the exchange in a strong position.''
   A search committee composed of present and former exchange board
members will choose a successor to Levitt.
   Under Levitt, the Amex introduced index options, including one
based on an index of foreign stocks that begins trading Friday. The
Securities and Exchange Commission also has approved plans for the
trading of so-called ``baskets'' of stocks on the Amex.
   The exchange undertook the options innovations to give the
exchange another avenue of business, although industry observers
say Amex remains far behind the Chicago Board of Options in that
area.
   ``I think we have carved out a very specific place in the U.S.
for emerging growth companies, the mid-range companies,'' Levitt
said.
   Average daily trading volume of the Amex's 895 listed companies
was 11.49 million shares in April. Average daily volume is 161.9
million shares for the NYSE's 1,680 listed companies and 133.3
million for about 5,080 issues traded on the national
over-the-counter market.
   The American exchange in 1988 reported net income of $2.6
million on revenue of $102.8 million, compared with profits of $8.3
million and revenue of $114.5 million in 1987, Amex's most
profitable year.
   ``The Amex always has had the difficulty of being the little
brother in the same city as the big brother,'' said Julius W.
Peake, who heads a capital markets consulting firm and studies the
nation's exchanges.
   ``It used to be considered the training ground for stocks that
were not yet qualified to make the Big Board. But in last 15 years
NASDAQ has dwarfed the Amex.''

   Dunkin' Donuts has remained cool to the advances
of a Canadian suitor, saying it would review a request for a
meeting to discuss a $42-per-share, or $300 million, buyout offer.
   Kingsbridge Capital Group made its request for a meeting
Thursday in a letter to Dunkin' Donuts Chairman Robert M.
Rosenberg, indicating the Toronto company believes the profitable
Massachusetts business is worth the trip.
   ``A meeting would facilitate avoiding the unnecessary disruption
and expense that so frequently accompany a misunderstanding of
intentions,'' said the letter from Kingsbridge chairman George S.
Mann.
   Kingsbridge, the merchant banking arm of Unicorp Canada Corp.,
said in an earlier filing with the Federal Trade Commission it had
already bought 7.6 percent of stock in the doughnut maker, which
owns or franchises more than 1,780 shops and reported earnings of
$13.5 million on sales of $112.8 million last year.
   Dunkin' Donuts vice president Richard N. Hart Jr. said there was
little reaction to the letter.
   ``Mr. Rosenberg will review the letter with his board at some
point,'' Hart said.
   Dunkin' Donuts has implemented a shareholders' rights plan and
an employee stock ownership plan, both aimed at thwarting an
unfriendly takeover.
   Kingsbridge has said its options include buying more shares of
Dunkin' Donuts, proposing a merger, mounting a hostile takeover or
waging a proxy battle for control of the board.
   ``Hopefully, they'll agree to sit down at the table with us so
we can sort it out,'' said Eric W. Evans, a Kingsbridge spokesman.
   Dunkin' Donuts stock rose to $39.62{ a share Thursday on the
over-the-counter market, up from $34.75 Wednesday.
   ``They're involved and they obviously want to stay involved so
time will tell how serious they are,'' said Roger Lipton, an
analyst with Landenburg, Thalmann in New York who follows Dunkin'
Donuts.
   ``I think management's made it clear they're going to resist
strongly,'' Lipton said. ``Bob Rosenberg doesn't want to work for
someone else.''

   Farmers who ran out of hay to feed their
livestock during last summer's drought may face a more serious
shortage this summer, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Dale M. Cochran
warns.
   ``The depletion of our hay stocks, combined with poor pasture
conditions, could lead to serious shortages of livestock feed this
summer,'' Cochran said Thursday.
   The nation's hay supply dropped by 10 million tons in 1989, and
severe drought-induced shortages in some Midwestern states have
caused Iowa hay prices to skyrocket, agriculture officials said.
   The nation's farmers had 17.63 million tons of hay on hand as of
May 1, 1989, down from 27.35 million tons at the same time in 1988,
according to figures released by the U.S. Agriculture Department.
   ``We had larger hay supplies on hand last year, but they were
quickly exhausted during the drought,'' Cochran said. ``Continued
dry weather may cause this year's smaller stocks to be depleted
much further.''
   Iowa's hay stock fared better than those of its neighboring
states, with 1.02 million tons on May 1, compared with 1.34 million
last year, the department said.
   ``Some neighboring states are down substantially and that is
putting a lot of pressure on hay prices in Iowa,'' said Bernie
Janssen of the Iowa Department of Agriculture. ``Drought-wise, they
ended up worse than we did.''
   Janssen said hay prices in Iowa soared to an average $96 a ton
as of mid-April, doubling from $48 in April 1988.
   Iowa's average hay price is much higher along the borders of
neighboring states such as South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin,
where hay stocks were significantly depleted last year because of
the drought, Janssen said.
   Those states also didn't have as many setaside acres from
Conservation Reserve Programs on which to plant hay.
   ``They didn't produce a lot of hay last year and had to use up a
lot of the hay they had on hand,'' Janssen said.
   South Dakota's hay stocks plummeted 1.5 million tons _ from 2.77
million tons on May 1, 1988 to 1.17 million this spring. Minnesota
is down to 626,000 tons of hay on hand from 1.48 million tons last
year, while North Dakota dropped from 1.34 million in 1988 to
442,000 in 1989.
   Hay supplies in Wisconsin are down 1 million tons, falling to
887,000 tons.
   ``They're down a lot, so consequently if you're selling hay in
Iowa it has really helped keep Iowa hay prices up here,'' Janssen
said.
   He said the national hay stock figures this year included all 48
states in the continental United States, of which only 11 showed an
increase in hay stocks. Most of the increase was on eastern
seaboard states, he said.
   No 1989 production estimates for corn, soybeans and other major
spring-planted crops were included in Thursday's report. The USDA
will issue projections for those crops later in the growing season.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges To 8-Month High, Stocks Down</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar surged to an eight-month high today
against the Japanese yen in Tokyo, while the key index on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange declined.
   The dollar ended the week at 135.80 yen, up 1.25 yen from
Thursday. It was the dollar's highest closing rate since it closed
at 136.03 yen on Sept. 5.
   A dealer with Sumitomo Bank said the dollar's rise was triggered
by ``a considerable amount of dollar-buying by institutional
investors from aboard'' and a Japanese official's remark tolerating
the dollar's rise.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a news conference today
that the dollar had risen partly because of its usual strength ``at
the time of an emergency such as confusion in the Panamanian
presidential election.''
   President Bush on Thursday ordered nearly 1,900 U.S. troops to
Panama to protect Americans there from violence following the
country's disputed presidential election.
   The U.S. currency is often regarded as a safe haven in times of
international tension.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 89.14 points on Thursday, lost 215.16 points,
or 0.63 percent, to finish the week at 33,866.33. Volume on the
market's first section was estimated at 750 million shares, the
same as Thursday.
   ``Uncertainties over who will be Japan's next prime minister and
when the nation's key interest rate will be hiked combined to
create a wait-and-see mood'' among many market participants, said
Hiromichi Ishikawa of Yamaichi Securities Co.

<HEAD>Thrifts Banking on Name Change to Ease Consumer Fears</HEAD>

   The words ``savings'' and ``loan'' often
follow ``troubled'' or ``shaky'' in news reports these days, so at
least a dozen Western thrifts are changing to the more
solid-sounding ``bank.''
   This week, Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, a solid
thrift and one of the nation's five largest, became Glendale
Federal Bank. Its federal insurance is unchanged; indeed, very
little will change except signs and stationery.
   But at a time when one-third of U.S. thrifts are expected to be
taken over by the federal government to avert failure, management
sees solid advantage in disassociating itself from the weak part of
the industry.
   ``Using the word `bank' conveys a solid image consistent with
our reputation,'' said Norman M. Coulson, Glendale Federal's
chairman and chief executive.
   ``You may think this is sort of in the Mickey Mouse category,
but from a marketing point of view it has value,'' said Peter
Treadway, an analyst at Smith Barney, Upham Harris &amp; Co. in New
York. ``I think John Q. Public may slightly be more reassured.''
   Perception is no small matter.
   The government reported Thursday that savers nationwide withdrew
$8.5 billion from the nation's thrifts in March, even though the
vast majority of those deposits are fully covered by federal
insurance.
   Thrift executives discussing the matter generally say worries
about the industry's image are a secondary reason for the change.
   They say the main motive is that S&amp;Ls are striving now to
compete with commercial banks, offering consumer services like
checking accounts and car loans, and it's believed that most people
think such services come from banks rather than thrifts.
   For the institution, the switch requires little effort. It must
persuade the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to shift it from a
savings and loan charter to the virtually identical savings bank
charter.
   Such a switch leaves the institution in the Federal Savings &amp;
Loan Insurance Corp., which is essentially insolvent and the target
of President Bush's hotly debated rescue proposal.
   Some thrifts have sought to move to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., the stronger fund that insures banks, but Congress
has slapped a moratorium on such moves in an effort to preserve the
FSLIC.
   Twelve S&amp;Ls in California, Arizona and Nevada have received
approval to adopt the bank name since the start of 1988, according
to a list provided by the Bank Board's regional office in San
Francisco.
   Elsewhere in the country, many others have applied for such
changes, said Bank Board spokesman Bill Fulwider in Washington. He
was unable to provide an exact number.
   Among the California S&amp;Ls adopting the bank name was American
Savings, the biggest thrift ever seized by federal regulators.

   Democratic congressional leaders are hoping
political pressure will convince President Bush to scuttle plans to
veto legislation raising the minimum wage, but an administration
official says Bush will not budge.
   ``A veto would send a signal to workers and the more than 80
percent of Americans who support a minimum wage increase that
George Bush doesn't care,'' Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., said
Thursday. ``He and the members of his party can judge the impact of
that decision in 1990.''
   Hawkins, chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee,
commented shortly after the House voted 247-172 in favor of raising
the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 by October 1991.
   The legislation, drafted by a House-Senate conference committee,
could clear the Senate as early as next week and then will be
forwarded to Bush.
   Shortly after the House vote, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
said Democrats were wasting a chance to raise the minimum wage by
their refusal to accept Bush's offer of a more modest increase _ to
$4.25 by January 1992. And she said any attempts to change Bush's
stance would fail.
   ``House Democrats said `no' to a compassionate, reasonable
increase in the minimum wage,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``Instead it
appears there will be no increase. The House insisted on sending
President Bush a bill that would cost hundreds of thousands of
Americans the opportunity to work _ a bill he most certainly will
veto.''
   The confrontation will be the first between the Congress and
Bush on domestic policy, and neither side has backed down in a
fight that has gained symbolic meaning far beyond the differences
on the minimum wage.
   Administration officials have said Bush will not allow Democrats
to seize the momentum on domestic policy by pushing a lengthy
agenda that includes proposals to establish mandatory benefits the
White House opposes.
   While Democrats have the votes to pass the measure in the
Senate, they are short in both houses of Congress of the two-thirds
majority needed to override Bush's expected veto. Sponsors of the
bill insist they will attempt to override, but their chances appear
dim.
   The leadership plans a mock signing ceremony after Senate
passage as part of its effort to put pressure on Bush, who is also
being urged to stage an elaborate veto ceremony in a community with
a large number of low-wage workers.
   The House debate Thursday mirrored the discussion earlier then
the chamber first passed Hawkins' bill.
   Democrats said Bush was trying to help the wealthy by spending
billions to bail out savings and loans and proposing new tax breaks
on capital gains but was unwilling to compromise on an issue
affecting 4 million working poor.
   Republicans argued that Bush had made a reasonable offer and
that only the provision in the administration proposal allowing new
hires to be paid a subminimum wage for six months would prevent
massive jobs losses if the minimum wage is increased.
   ``There can be no further compromise that throws people out of
work,'' said Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas. ``President Bush has
offered the compromise.''
   In rejecting Bush's offer, Democratic leaders said Bush's
proposed increase was too small and also assailed his ``training
wage'' because the provision requires no actual training. In their
final bill, Democrats allowed workers with less than 60 days of
work experience to be paid a subminimum.

   Drivers who crash in a Dodge Spirit 4-door
sedan have the least protection against head injuries among seven
vehicles tested so far this year, the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration says.
   The cars were smashed at 35 mph into a fixed barrier, and the
resulting stresses were measured by sensors on human-shaped dummies
protected by seat belts or, when sold as standard equipment, air
bags.
   Stresses on the head were reported as an index referred to as
the head injury criterion.
   The crash test of the Spirit, which is in the large- and
mid-size car category, produced a head-injury criterion of 1,421 in
the driver's position, NHTSA said.
   The Spirit was the first 1989 model tested to exceed the maximum
head-injury criterion of 1,000 allowed by federal regulations in
the required 30 mph barrier crash. However, NHTSA's public testing
is performed at 35 mph, which produces higher results than the
mandatory test.
   Other new test results by weight class produced these driver
head-injury criteria:
   _Subcompact cars: Dodge Daytona 2-door hatchback, 399; Honda
Civic CRX 2-door hatchback, 750.
   _Large and mid-size cars: Ford Thunderbird 2-door, 541.
   NHTSA said the crash tests are the equivalent of a head-on
collision between two identical vehicles, each moving at 35 mph, or
between one vehicle moving at 70 mph and a parked vehicle.
   Small differences in test results shouldn't be considered
significant, NHTSA said. Only one vehicle of each type is tested,
and slight variations in construction or test conditions could
produce differing results in additional tests, the agency said.
   Previous test results, by weight class, were:
   _Subcompact: Mitsubishi Mirage 4-door sedan, 960.
   _Compact: Mitsubishi Galant 4-door sedan, 971.
   _Large and mid-size: Eagle Medallion 4-door sedan, 745.
   Automakers are required to crash-test their products for safety
certification under federal regulation, but the results are rarely
made public.
   NHTSA began its own assessment program for public release in
1979.

   The Alaska oil disaster is prompting Congress
to revisit an idea that has languished on Capitol Hill for 15
years: the creation of a government-controlled fund to pay for an
oil spill's devastation.
   The Bush administration on Thursday sent to a House panel a
proposal for a $500 million emergency fund to deal with oil spill
cleanup and recovery. The money would come from a 1.3-cent-a-barrel
fee on all domestic and imported petroleum.
   As Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner explained the details
to members of the subcommittee on Coast Guard and navigation,
several panel members noted that the subject is far from new.
   Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., pointed out that similar legislation
has been debated without attracting much interest in every Congress
since 1975. Three times bills cleared the House but not the Senate.
   ``I hope we're not going to reinvent the wheel. We've had
numerous hearings on this,'' said Rep. Donald Young, R-Alaska.
   But the spill of 11 million gallons of oil from the Exxon Valdez
tanker in Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24 and the
problems that have surfaced since then in containing and cleaning
up the oil have virtually ensured that similar legislation will
pass this year, some congressmen suggested.
   ``It took a tragedy like the Exxon Valdez to cause the entire
Congress to focus on the issue,'' said Rep. Walter Jones, D-Okla.,
chairman of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.
   In addition to the administration bill, the House is considering
a slightly different measure sponsored by Jones that calls for a
$300 million cleanup fund.
   Some provisions of the administration bill likely will be
incorporated into Jones' bill, one congressional staffer said. A
subcommittee vote already is scheduled for later this month.
   The fund would be tapped only for costs beyond those for which
the company or shipper is directly liable. The administration's
legislation establishes a $78 million liability ceiling, while the
Jones bill sets a $60 million maximum.
   Legislation was introduced in the Senate on Wednesday by Sen.
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, calling for creation of a $500 million
federal oil spill cleanup fund. It, too, would be financed through
a fee on domestic and imported oil.
   The Stevens legislation also would require the Coast Guard to
respond to a major oil spill and would give the Coast Guard access
to up to $150 million of the cleanup fund.
   In more than a dozen congressional hearings since the Exxon
Valdez spill, congressmen have bemoaned the lack of industry and
government preparedness to such an emergency.
   Skinner, who has been the Bush administration's point man on the
Alaska spill, said when the Exxon Valdez ran aground, the
government had only a few million dollars available in oil spill
recovery funds.
   Had that spill been caused by a company less well-to-do than the
Exxon Corp., the government would have had to scramble for funds
and ask Congress for tens of millions of dollars to get the cleanup
effort going, Skinner said.
   Estimates of the cost of the Exxon spill, the worst in U.S.
history, ranged from about $100 million to many times that amount.
   Skinner said it was too early to predict the eventual total.
Salaries for the thousands of workers cleaning the fouled Alaska
beaches alone run as high as $75,000 an hour for 20-hour work days,
Skinner said.
   ``The numbers are very big,'' he continued, indicating at one
point that even the proposed $500 million cleanup fund might have
been inadequate. He suggested that something in the range of ``$500
million to $1 billion should cover it.''
   The administration proposal would make $500 million available in
the event of another major spill, but Skinner said the president
would have the authority to exceed that amount. The government
could then seek additional fees from the industry.

<HEAD>EPA Effort to Ban Alar, Once Launched, Could Take Three Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It could take up to three years to implement a
ban on the apple-ripening agent Alar, even though the Environmental
Protection Agency expects to soon begin formal steps to prohibit
its use.
   ``We are going to do it. And shortly, probably within the next
10 days,'' EPA spokesman Albert Heier said Thursday.
   Consumer groups says the growth regulator presents a health
risk, especially to children, and the EPA has said ``inescapable''
laboratory evidence exists that Alar triggered cancerous tumors in
test mice.
   Nonetheless, the EPA, the Agriculture Department and the Food
and Drug Administration have all pronounced apples safe for
consumption. An estimated 5 percent of the crop is treated with
small amounts of Alar.
   The EPA, which previously said it could not justify an emergency
ban of Alar, announced in February that it planned within 90 days
to initiate more routine procedures to eliminate its use in the
future. That period elapsed without a formal rulemaking proposal.
   Processed Apples Institute, Inc., the trade organization
representing processors of apple products, urged an immediate
announcement by the EPA of its action toward a ban in hopes it will
send a ``loud and clear signal'' to dissuade growers from using the
chemical, even while it's legal. May is the month when many
orchards are sprayed.
   Public fears about the use of Alar by some growers have caused
the sales of apple products such as juice and sauce to drop off 20
percent from the same period last year, said Larry Davenport,
executive director of the institute.
   ``We know, and all federal government agencies have reaffirmed,
that apples and apple products are safe,'' said Davenport. ``But
with the public hysteria and misinformation surrounding this issue,
it has been difficult for makers of apple juices and sauces to get
the truth across about product safety.''
   He said processors have refused since 1986 to buy apples
containing Alar, although small amounts have slipped through the
screening process.
   The banning process that could take at least 15 months at best,
and up to three years if contested.
   Alar, the Uniroyal Chemical Co.'s marketing name for daminozide,
is an organic acid that helps keep apples on the tree until they
are ripe, and also keeps them red and crisp for a longer period
after harvest.

   Opponents of the $6 billion Seabrook nuclear
reactor are seeking an emergency court order barring low-power
atomic tests at the embattled New Hampshire plant.
   A request for an immediate stay to block a low-power license
pending further judicial review was filed at the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals here Thursday by Massachusetts, the town of Hampton,
N.H., the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League and the New England
Coalition on Nuclear Pollution.
   Seabrook opponents are anticipating that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission will reject their pleas for a regulatory stay and issue
the license soon.
   Late Thursday, NRC counsel Gregory Alan Berry recommended that
the commissioners reject the stay request. That issue is the last
of a long series of regulatory obstacles that has held up the
license for three years.
   An emergency court order blocking the tests is critical to the
opponents' strategy of ensuring that the 1,150-megawatt reactor
never operates commercially. If the NRC grants the license and the
court refuses an emergency stay, Seabrook operators could start and
finish the low-power tests before the full appeal is heard by the
courts, rendering the case moot.
   ``Low-power operation can commence as soon as the license (is
issued). Therefore, absent a stay, low-power operation will
immediately cause severe environmental and financial harm to
residents of New Hampshire and Massachusetts,'' the opponents wrote
in a 77-page memorandum to the court.
   Seabrook officials have said they will begin low-power tests 10
days after the NRC authorizes operations, a move that could come as
early as Monday.
   The opponents asked the appeals court to rule on their emergency
stay request before Monday, but there was no indication when a
ruling would come, said Diane Curran, a Washington attorney
representing the New England Coalition on Nuclear Pollution.
   Massachusetts Deputy Attorney General Stephen A. Jonas said he
believes the NRC will not issue the license until the court rules.
   Low-power tests are a critical step toward commercial operation
for the plant, which New England utilities say is badly needed to
meet the region's energy needs into the 21st century.
   Seabrook critics, who believe the coastal towns near the plant
could never be safely evacuated, fear low-power tests will provide
momentum as Seabrook pushes for a full-power commercial license.
   In court papers, opponents argued that potential difficulties in
evacuating nearby coastal communities in southern New Hampshire and
northeastern Massachusetts, coupled with the plant's financial
problems, make it doubtful that Seabrook will ever operate
commercially. Therefore, they said, low-power tests will
unnecessarily contaminate the reactor with radioactivity, vastly
increasing the cost of dismantling.
   ``It's an exercise in self-gratification,'' said Massachusetts
Attorney General James M. Shannon in Boston. ``They want to do it
because it's going to make them feel good _ at a terrible
environmental and economic cost to the people of this region.
   ``As long as there remains the very real possibility that this
plant will never go on line, it is completely irrational to take
this irreversible step,'' he added.
   Issues the opponents list in their request for an emergency
court order include an NRC rule change last year allowing low-power
tests without an emergency public alert siren system in place in
nearby towns.
   Massachusetts forced Seabrook officials to remove sirens in the
Bay State communities that fall within Seabrook's 10-mile
evacuation zone. Plant officials since have developed a system of
truck- and helicopter-mounted sirens to notify Massachusetts
residents of a Seabrook emergency.
   Seabrook spokesman Rob Williams said plant officials would
withhold specific comments until they saw the legal papers, but he
defended the atomic reactor and its safety.
   ``There's never been a plant in history so much scrutinized and
passed so many tests,'' Williams said. ``This is a safe plant with
outstanding individuals prepared to operate it.''

   A top Coast Guard officer told Exxon to

beaches fouled by the company's oil spill, a move likely to draw
opposition from environmentalists.
   Meanwhile, a newspaper reported Thursday that Joseph Hazelwood,
the fired skipper of the tanker Exxon Valdez, will not testify
before the National Transportation Safety Board and will try to get
his June 20 trial transferred out of Valdez.
   Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the ranking federal
official in the spill zone, said Thursday that the chemicals _
called ``dispersants'' _ may have to be used on the rocky island
shores of Prince William Sound because other cleansing methods have
proven ineffective.
   ``I`m not hot on dispersants but I think we've got to look at
it,'' Robbins said.
   He told Exxon to develop a plan to use the dispersants and
submit it for federal review.
   Dispersants are chemicals that are sprayed onto the oil, break
the oil down and thin it out, then allow it to be washed away by
the tides. Environmentalists say they may harm marine life and
remain in the water for long periods.
   The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said the
methods used to clean the beaches to date ``are not efficient at
removing this oil which is trapped in the soil ... or trapped
within the shoreline sediment. More effective methods neeed to be
used.''
   Attorney Dick Madson was quoted in the Fairbanks Daily
News-Miner as saying that Hazelwood, 42, had provided information
in writing to the NTSB, which is to begin its hearings Tuesday in
Anchorage.
   Hazelwood is accused of three misdemeanor counts that include
operating the 987-foot vessel while drunk. He was in command of the
tanker March 24, when it slammed into a reef about 25 miles off
Valdez and leaked more than 10 million gallons of crude into Prince
William Sound.
   ``I think Fairbanks is the best place to have this trial. There
are no close ties to the fishing industry here,'' Madson said.
   Fairbanks, Alaska's second-largest city, has strong ties to the
oil industry, with about half of the city's $950 million-a-year
economy stemming from oil.
   Hazelwood faces a maximum penalty of 27 months in jail and
$11,000 in fines if convicted of all charges. He is also the
subject of a felony grand jury investigation in Anchorage.
   In other developments:
   _Officials said Thursday that 14 Exxon cleanup workers became
temporarily ill from inhaling oil fumes and received medical
emergency treatment, forcing a halt in part of the Alaska oil spill
cleanup.
   The workers were taken ill Tuesday in the Port Chatham area of
the Kenai Peninsula, and treated at a nearby medical center and
discharged Wednesday.
   The symptoms included nausea, skin irritation, respiratory
complaints and burning eyes, said officials of the interagency
Center for Disaster Assistance. Work in the area is suspended until
respirators are obtained, officials said.
   _Authorities said more than 20 tons of animals that have been
killed by the spill are being held in deep freeze while Exxon and
government officials try to agree on a way to dispose of the
carcasses.
   The dead animals include more than 9,400 birds and 600 sea
otters, along with 28 bald eagles.
   Exxon wants to use hospital incinerators, but residents say they
worry air quality would suffer and officials are uncertain if
incineration would require exemptions from environmental
regulations.
   Exxon's overall proposal for cleaning up the spill calls for
5,000 people scouring the shores by midsummer, with 364 miles of
beaches cleaned by Sept. 15. Thus far, the cleanup has cost the
company nearly $100 million, according to Exxon executives.

<HEAD>Chinese Study U.S. Futures Markets; May Create Their Own</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a journey that took them to the heart of
capitalism, a Chinese delegation visited several U.S. futures
exchanges this week in hopes of creating ``socialist-style''
commodity markets back home.
   Their signing today of an agreement with the Chicago Board of
Trade to establish a Beijing-based training program for Chinese
traders is yet another sign of the Chinese government's willingness
to bend the communist line to accomodate useful free-market
concepts.
   Under the agreement, CBOT personnel will spend up to one month
each year in the Chinese capital ``to teach intensified courses on
futures markets and trading techniques,'' the CBOT said. The
Chinese will send economists to Chicago for a work-study program on
the CBOT floor.
   ``We will adapt the futures market from the Western style into
socialist style _ a combination of the two systems,'' said Lu Jian
Guang, the only English-speaking member of the four-man group.
   And although professional speculators and high-risk futures
contracts probably won't be part of the first Chinese grain
exchange, there's no telling how far things could go once the
bidding begins.
   ``It all depends on the outside environment _ political reforms
as well as economic reforms,'' Lu said Thursday.
   A Chinese commodity market would be unique in the communist
world, said David Granick, a professor of economics at the
University of Wisconsin.
   ``So far as I know, I've never read of nor heard any talk of
commmodity markets in any communist country,'' he said.
   The free market reigns supreme on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the world's oldest and largest commodity market, where traders
compete aggressively _ sometimes violently _ to buy and sell
contracts for future deliveries of commodities ranging from
soybeans to Treasury bonds.
   The new agreement expands a deal struck between the Board of
Trade and the International Trade Research Institute of China's
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade in April 1986 to
exchange visitors with an eye toward developing some sort of
commodities market in China.
   The Chinese initiated the exchange because they wanted ``to gain
a fuller understanding of the nature and workings of futures
markets,'' said Pat Catania, the Board of Trade's marketing
director.
   Catania said the Chinese have tried futures trading in such
commodities as corn, sugar and tin in markets in Chicago, New York
and London.
   A futures market functions as an insurance policy for producers
and consumers of agricultural commodities such as wheat or cattle.
It allows these commercial players to lock in prices in advance,
thus protecting themselves from price swings caused by weather
problems, plant disease or other disasters.
   The Board of Trade began its life 140 years ago as a place for
commercial grain players to both make deals and deliver goods, but
no one takes physical delivery of grain there any more.
   Most contracts are settled in cash, a feature that invites
professional speculators to play the markets and has earned the
exchange, and other futures markets, a reputation as glorified
casinos.
   Lu said China's first grain exchange, which probably will be
located in the agricultural Hunan province, would hark back to the
early days of the Board of Trade. Grain farmers and grain users
would use the exchange to agree in advance on prices, but
individual speculators would be barred.
   He would not predict a start-up date for the first Chinese
commodity market.
   The Chinese, who spent most of their weeklong U.S. stay in
Chicago, also visited the Kansas City Board of Trade and the
Minneapolis Grain Exchange.

   Barron Hilton, who gained control of 34
percent of Hilton Hotels Corp. after a 10-year struggle over his
father's estate, said the company would consider offers from
interested buyers.
   Addressing shareholders at the hotel-casino company's annual
meeting Thursday, Hilton said he had received calls from investment
bankers since Monday about generating a deal. After the meeting,
however, Hilton noted that there have been no potential suitors
have yet surfaced.
   Speculation about Hilton's future drove the company's stock up
$6.50 a share Thursday in heavy trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. It ended the day at a new high of $72 a share.
   Hilton, the company's chairman and chief executive, said he was
``neutral'' about a sale of the company.
   Executors of founder Conrad N. Hilton's estate on Monday
distributed the final amount of shares of Hilton Hotels, about 13.5
million, which set off speculation on Wall Street that the firm may
be sold within months.
   As a result of a negotiated settlement, Hilton owns 25 percent
of the stock and has voting control over another 9 percent that is
held in trust.
   Under the agreement, he received about $334 million of the $654
million market value that the stock represented at that time. The
Conrad N. Hilton Foundation received the remaining $320 million.

<HEAD>Sears Chairman Hopes For June Decision On Moving Merchandising Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. is continuing negotiations
to sell its landmark headquarters, but the company would like to
keep most major operations based in the Chicago area, Chairman
Edward A. Brennan says.
   ``These are our roots,'' Brennan said. ``We have been here
almost since the beginning.''
   Sears hopes to announce in June where its 6,000-employee
Merchandising Group will be relocated, but is ``nowhere near making
a determination'' now, Brennan told reporters after the company's
annual meeting Thursday.
   ``All I can say is that we're looking very hard at all of the
alternatives,'' Brennan said. ``The truth is that we really don't
have all of the costs laid out.''
   Sears would need at least 1 million square feet to house the
Merchandise Group, space that would be ``greater than most of the
parcels we own in the Chicago area,'' Brennan said.
   State economic development officials have reportedly offered
Sears sites near O'Hare International Airport and in Hoffman
Estates.
   The Merchandise Group is currently housed in the Sears Tower,
which the retailer plans to sell as part of a restructuring program
announced last fall.
   Concerning the sale of the Sears Tower, the world's tallest
building located in the heart of Chicago, Brennan would only say
``negotiations are proceeding.''
   He called Wednesday's discussions with Illinois Gov. James R.
Thompson and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley concerning a site for
the Merchandise Group ``excellent,'' and said Illinois officials
were supportive in trying to keep the Sears subsidiary in the state.
   ``We intend to meet with the governor and the mayor again,
probably within the next two weeks to three weeks,'' Brennan said.
``We hope to be able to make a decision as we move into the month
of June.''
   He would not discuss incentives, nor would he compare them to
those offered by other states.
   While Brennan reiterated the company's position that it ``would
prefer to remain in the Chicago-land area,'' he said the retailer
has a responsibility to its shareholders ``to look at all of the
options'' based on comparisons of land costs, the costs of
relocation and taxes.
   Among the cities vying to land the Merchandise Group are Dallas,
Charlotte, N.C. and Kansas City, Mo.
   Brennan's news conference followed the company's first annual
meeting since it announced last October that it would sell the
Sears Tower, move the Merchandise Group to new and cheaper
quarters, offer more brand-name products and shift to an everyday
low-pricing strategy for its stores.

   Wayne E. Hedien has been named chairman and chief

Richard J. Haayen, who is retiring after more than 37 years with
the company, officials said.
   Haayen, who served as Allstate's chief executive officer since

Sears Roebuck and Co., announced Thursday.
   Hedien, 55, a native of Evanston, Ill., joined Allstate in 1966
as an investment analyst. He moved up through the company ranks to
become president in October 1986.
   The company said Raymond H. Kiefer would replace Hedien as
Allstate's president. Kiefer, 62, joined Allstate in 1952 as a
claims adjuster and most recently was president of Allstate's
personal property and casualty unit.
   Sears Chairman Edward A. Brennan said Haayen ``has provided
outstanding leadership in guiding Allstate's continued profitable
growth and in forging closer and more profitable links with Sears
other business groups.''

   The federal government should revamp its system
for forcing improvements in car fuel economy and hold all
automakers to the same percentage improvement each year, Ford Motor
Co.'s chairman says.
   ``I think people are being very misguided in thinking they are
helping the environmental question by ramping up the fuel
economy,'' Donald Petersen said Thursday after the No. 2 U.S.
automaker's annual meeting.
   Petersen said corporate average fuel economy standards are a
``real penalty'' to Ford and industry-leader General Motors Corp.
   Because of its reliance on smaller cars, Chrysler Corp. has had
little trouble in the past meeting federally mandated fuel
standards.
   ``An alternative we are suggesting,'' he said, ``would be ... to
ask all manufacturers to achieve an equal percentage improvement in
x-number of vehicles.''
   Petersen said Ford should be ready within five years to put on
the road a fleet of cars powered by a variety of fuels.
   ``We are negotiating with the state of California right now to
provide them with a fleet of 2,500 flexible fuel vehicles,''
Petersen said, adding that such a fleet could be ready well before
1995.
   There has been increasing debate recently about the use of fuels
other than gasoline to power cars and trucks, spurred in part by
rising oil prices and concern about vehicle emissions contributing
to a global warming trend.
   Much of the effort has been concentrated on use of methanol,
which would require substantial changes in automobile engineering.
   Research into alternative fuels is facing a dilemma, Petersen
said.
   Oil companies don't want to commit large resources to develop
alternative fuels because automakers haven't developed vehicles
that can use them, he said. Automakers haven't made vehicles that
can use alternative fuels because oil companies haven't developed
the fuels.
   ``Flexible-fuel vehicles are an obvious way around the chicken
and egg problem,'' Petersen said.
   During Thursday's meeting, the Rev. Louis Johnson of Detroit
urged Petersen and the board of directors to cut all connections
with South Africa, which is limited to licensing the use of the
Ford nameplate on vehicles made by Samcor, a successor to Ford's
manufacturing operations in South Africa.
   Ford withdrew its financial presence from South Africa beginning
in late 1987 by donating and selling its portion of Samcor to
employees and the corporation.
   The company continues to sell vehicles with Ford nameplates in
South Africa, spokesman Al Chambers said, and some are sold to the
government.
   ``Since the company's products are still available, the
withdrawal amounts to corporate camouflage,'' Johnson said.
   Petersen said the company decries the segregationist policies of
the South African government, but keeping the automaker in
business, rather than selling it off two years ago, was the proper
course to take.
   Thursday's meeting also saw two great-grandsons of founder Henry
Ford assume important committee posts within the company.
   Edsel Ford II and his cousin, William Clay Ford Jr., members of
Ford's board of directors since January 1988, were appointed to the
automaker's executive and audit committees.
   The Ford family controls about 40 percent of the company's stock.

<TEXT>
   Ogilvy Group Inc. today said it has begun talks
with Britain's WPP Group PLC, which has made a $50-a-share takeover
offer for the American advertising company and indicated its
willingness to increase the bid.
   Ogilvy said there is no guarantee the discussions will produce
an agreement on WPP acquiring Ogilvy, the world's fifth-largest
advertising concern based on 1988 billings.
   Takeover speculators on Wall Street have expected WPP to make a
more generous offer. WPP's current offer values Ogilvy at about
$750 million.
   Arbitragers earlier this week pushed Ogilvy's stock $2 above the
latest WPP bid and in early over-the-counter trading today, Ogilvy
shares were up 87{ cents, at $52.75.
   WPP started its bidding at $45 a share and has maintained all
along that it wanted to negotiate a friendly deal, avoiding the
possibly costly delays of a hostile transaction.
   Purchasing Ogilvy would make WPP, the London-based owner of the
U.S. agency J. Walter Thompson and the world's third-largest
advertising company, roughly match in size industry leader Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi Co. PLC.
   A statement issued by Ogilvy said any agreement between the two,
which would have to be approved by both companies' boards, would be
contingent upon certain conditions, which were not specified.

<HEAD>Peabody Plans for Recapitalization, Change in Ownership Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peabody Holding Co., the largest coal company in
North America, will undergo a recapitalization and partial change
of ownership, according to Newmont Mining Corp., Peabody's largest
shareholder.
   The recapitalization, which will include the payment of a $425
million dividend to Newmont, will help pay down Newmont's $1.2
billion debt, Newmont said in a statement released Thursday by its
Denver office.
   Newmont executives said the deal had nothing to do with an
attempt by South African-controlled Minorco SA to take over
Britain's Consolidated Gold Fields PLC.
   Gold Fields owns 49 percent of Newmont. Analysts said Newmont's
long-range plans was to use the proceeds of the recapitalization at
Peabody toward buying back its shares in Gold Fields and becoming
an independent company.
   Newmont owns 49.97 percent of Peabody. Under the plan announced
Thursday, the three largest of Peabody's four other stockholders,
Bechtel Instruments Inc., Boeing Co. and Eastern Enterprises, have
granted Peabody the right until Oct. 31 to purchase their shares
for an aggregate price of $518 million.
   A similar per-share offer was made to the fourth shareholder,
which was identified in news reports as Equitable Life Assurance
Society.
   Peabody will refinance most of its debt before the stock
buyback, and, after the stock is repurchased, pay the $425 million
dividend to Newmont, which at that point will briefly be Peabody's
sole owner.
   Newmont will then sell 50.03 percent of the coal company for $75
million to Salomon Brothers Inc. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   As a result of the transaction, Newmont will be left with a
stake in Peabody identical to what it currently owns, and will have
a total of $500 million with which to reduce its debt to
approximately $750 million, Newmont said.
   Newmont will also have the option after four years to repurchase
the stake held by Salomon and Shearson.
   The deal will increase the debt on Peabody's books. But Peabody
President Robert H. Quenon said he did not expact the
recapitalization and ownership change to have a major effect on the
company's busienss.
   ``We have gone through similar situations before and have
emerged a stronger company,'' he said in a statement.
   Newmont reported $1.2 billion debt at the end of 1988, which
included the cost of expansion programs and the payment of a $2.2
billion dividend in 1987, James Hill, a Newmont spokesman said.
   Peabody is the parent of a group of coal mining, marketing and
related corporations that produce more coal than any other company
in the United States.
   In 1988, Peabody sold 81.5 million tons of coal, producing
revenue of $1.7 billion. It has long-term contracts to deliver more
than 1 billion tons of coal over the next 30 years.
   Newmont, based in New York, has interests in gold, copper and
other metals and energy resources including coal.

   The stock market spurted at the opening bell
today after the government released a lower-than-expected producer
price report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 44.36 points to
2,427.24 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EDT.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than 8 to 1 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 977 issues up, 121 down and 312
unchanged.
   Volum on the Big Board totaled 48.27 million shares.
   The government reported today that the producer price index rose
0.4 percent in April, despite a sharp increase in energy prices.
The report, which measures prices at the wholesale level, suggested
that inflation may be easing.
   ``The market surged all on the PPI and the strong rally in
bonds. That's the whole story in a nutshell,'' said Hildegarde
Zagorski, vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The market had held back all week waiting for the numbers to
provide a better indication of the inflation picture after last
week's mixed signals from the unemployment report.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 2.40 to 174.11.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
gained 2.08 to 347.70.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.43 to
2,382.88.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by a margin of about 4 to 3
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 785 issues up, 602 down and 568 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 151.62 million shares, up from 146
million in the previous session.

   A federal judge said Celebrity Plus magazine's
cover looks too much like People Weekly and ordered changes in
Celebrity's cover format.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet issued a preliminary injunction
Thursday barring Globe Communications Corp., which has published
Celebrity Plus since January 1987, from using elements of the
People Weekly cover.
   Time Inc., which owns People, sued last month even after Globe
changed the dot over the ``i'' in Celebrity to a star and added the
words ``A Globe Publication,'' to the cover.
   ``We intend to further refine the logo,'' said Leonard M. Marks,
an attorney for Globe. ``That will end any possible complaint
People has. We really think People brought this action as a way to
stifle competition, but we intend to compete with them nose to
nose.''
   Not surprisingly, People magazine took a different view.
   ``At this stage, the court has found that Globe intentionally
set out to mislead the public and to intentionally copy People's
cover format,'' said Betsy Wagner, a spokeswoman for People.
   In a 23-page decision, Sweet said Time Inc. ``has shown that
they will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted
...''
   More than half of People's sales, at $1.79 per copy, occur at
newsstands, supermarket checkouts and bookstores.
   Court papers said People sold 1.1 billion copies between 1981
and 1988.
   Time Inc., which has published People since 1974, claimed that
``the cover of People plays a critical role in the newsstand sales
and that the substantially consistent cover subject and cover
format are used to attract readers who rely on the distinctive
cover format in selecting the magazine.''
   Celebrity Plus, a monthly that prints 250,000 copies a month at
$1.95 each, altered its cover format for its May 1989 issue to
contain elements ``which were already a part of People's cover
format,'' wrote Sweet.
   Those elements included bordering the letters in the magazine's
name in a contrasting color and having the letters touch or blend
into each other.

   Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent
in April, despite the sharpest increase in energy costs in nearly
2{ years, the government said today.
   The gain in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
reflected a steep jump in gasoline prices, counterbalanced by a
substantial drop in auto prices and broad declines in food costs.
   It followed an identical 0.4 percent gain in March and large,
back-to-back 1 percent jumps in January and February.
   Because of the steep rises early in the year, wholesale price
inflation, one stop short of retail, advanced at a 9 percent annual
rate in the first four months of 1989.
   Bond prices soared in early trading. The Treasury's key 30-year
bond _ a widely-watched barometer of inflationary speculation _ was
up more than $20 per $1,000 in face amount with its yield tumbling
about a quarter point from 9.06 percent late Thursday.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
rocketed more than 44 points higher in the first 20 minutes of
trading. By 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow was up 36.29 points at 2,419.17.
   ``This is very good news ... but the inflation watch is not
over,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association
of Wholesaler-Distributors. ``My concern is it's dangerous to
generalize long-term trends from any 30-day snapshot. We still have
some sectors in the economy that are hot even though some have
slowed.''
   In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said
business inventories in March rose 0.3 percent while sales were
flat, confirming earlier government statistics showing economic
growth slowing.
   Economists were paying particular attention to the inflation
rate for goods other than the volatile food and energy categories,
which edged down 0.1 percent in April following a 0.3 percent rise
in March. It was the first drop since an identical fall in October
1987.
   A 0.6 percent decline in food costs was the biggest since a 1.1
percent decline in December 1987 and represented the first
substantial price relief since last year's drought.
   The huge 7.2 percent rise in energy costs matched the increase
in January 1987. Energy prices have not risen more sharply in one
month in 15 years.
   The energy increase was almost entirely attributable to a 13.4
percent climb in gasoline prices, the steepest since January 1987.
Fuel oil rose a comparatively moderate 0.6 percent after zooming
16.8 percent in March. Natural gas prices advanced 1.9 percent
   The decline in food was led by a 15.9 percent drop in eggs.
Vegetables fell 7.5 percent; pork, 3.6 percent; fruit, 2.7 percent;
and fish, 1.3 percent. The prices of turkeys, rice and candy rose.
   The biggest drop in categories other than food and energy came
in autos, where prices fell 2.8 percent, the result of
manufacturers' incentives to lure customers into showrooms and
revive slumping sales.
   There were also declines in children's clothing, cosmetics,
magazines and tires. Prices rose for jewelry and electronic
equipment.
   The overall April increase left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 113.0, meaning that a hypothetical selection of
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $113 last month, up from
$112.20 in March.
   Inflation measures earlier in the production process also showed
moderation. Intermediate goods rose 0.4 percent in April following
a 0.7 percent jump in March. Crude goods rose 0.6 percent following
a 2.3 percent gain.
   An example of the three processing levels would be finished _
wholesale bread; intermediate _ flour, and crude _ wheat.
   The 9 percent annual rate of wholesale inflation so far this
year is more than double the 4 percent price rise last year and
four times the 2.2 percent gain in 1987.
   Analysts, however, are divided over whether inflation will
continue accelerating later this year.
   Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser,
acknowledged earlier this week that ``we may see another bumpy
month or two.'' But he pointed out that ``the great bulk of the
acceleration was due to the increased price of crude oil.''
   ``As (oil prices) stabilize, they will no longer contribute to''
inflation, Boskin said in a speech to the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   Stock and bond markets had been trading quietly most of the week
as traders awaited today's report. They worried that if the
inflation number was too severe, the Federal Reserve Board would
push interest rates higher to cool the economy and ease inflation
pressure.
   The Fed's Open Market Committee, which stepped up its fight
against inflation in February after the bad news for January was
released, meets next Tuesday to set monetary policy through June.
Analysts generally expect the committee to leave policy unchanged.
   The Fed pushed up short-term interest rates three percentage
points between March 1988 and March 1989 and there is some evidence
that its tight-money moves are working.
   Job growth slowed in April as the unemployment rate jumped to
5.3 percent from 5.0 percent in March. Retail sales for the month
rose a modest 0.4 percent after two weak months.

   Stock prices surged in early trading today after
the government released a better-than-expected producer price
report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 36.29 points to
2,419.17 at 11 a.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 44.36
points an hour earlier.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 13
to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,079 issues up, 250 down
and 403 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 86.73 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported today that the producer price
index rose 0.4 percent in April, the same as in March, despite a
sharp increase in energy prices. The market had expected an
increase of as high as 1 percent.
   Traders interpreted the report to mean a further softening of
the economy and an easing of inflationary pressures. Analysts said
investors hope the numbers will prod the Federal Reserve to loosen
its grip on monetary policy.
   Bonds, whose value is eroded by inflation, surged on the news
and stocks followed.
   ``That's the whole story in a nutshell,'' said Hildegarde
Zagorski, vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   However, because of the steep price rises early in the year,
wholesale price inflation, one stop short of retail, advanced at a
9 percent annual rate in the first four months.
   Some economists predicted that prices would rise more sharply
later in the year and that interest rates would continue to climb.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 2.21 to 173.92.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
gained 1.72 to 347.34.

<HEAD>Salomon To Invest Up To $75 Million In Failed Thrifts, Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street's Salomon Inc. will be the lead
investor in a partnership that intends to buy failed savings and
loans with $10 billion or more in combined assets.
   Big Wall Street firms and private investors that once ignored
S&amp;Ls are pouring money in, partly because of assistance that should
be provided by the government through a $157 billion financial
package now making its way through Congress.
   If the new partnership, Stone Capital Partners, gets all the
investors it is seeking, it would form the largest pool of private
money solely dedicated to buying failed thrifts, John H. Gutfreund,
Salomon's chief executive, said Thursday.
   Picking and managing the S&amp;Ls will be Blackstone Group, a New
York investment banking firm, and Old Stone Corp. of Providence,
R.I., which is a holding company for thrifts.
   ``We think the fund will be a very good investor in the
industry,'' Laurence Fink, chairman of Blackstone Financial
Management, an affiliate of Blackstone Group, said in an interview
Friday.
   Stone Capital Partners intends to raise $300 million to $600
million. Through leverage, that would allow it to buy institutions
with $10 billion to $20 billion in assets. However, since capital
requirements are rising, it is unlikely that the higher figure
would be attained.
   A Salomon affiliate has agreed to provide at least 9.9 percent
of the money committed to the fund, up to a maximum of $75 million.
Other investors will include pension funds and insurance companies,
both in the United States and abroad, Fink said.
   The fund is dedicated to buying financial service companies in
general, but thrifts are expected to make up the vast majority of
its portfolio.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as
weather factors took precedence over a bullishly construed crop
report.
   Prices opened higher in reaction to Thursday's Agriculture
Department report, which projected an 8 percent decline in 1989
U.S. winter wheat production, due mainly to dry conditions and
harsh winter weather in Kansas.
   Forecasts for rain this weekend in the Great Plains and the
Midwest prompted the early selling, but some observers said traders
were unsure how to interpret the forecasts.
   Showers in the Plains could be accompanied by high winds and
hail, ``so it might do more damage than good,'' said Joel Karlin, a
research analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   In the eastern Corn Belt, cold, wet weather has delayed planting
to the point that more rain may be viewed as positive for prices,
Karlin said.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.24{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to
2 cents lower with May at $2.75{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to
1\ cents lower with May at $1.84{ a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents

cent higher with June at 48.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies

   ``The reason why the market is responding so positively to the

director of economic research at Argus Research Corp. ``The fact
that we had just a 0.4 percent increase in producer prices despite
the massive 7 percent rise in energy prices is a very good
development. It takes the pressure off the Fed to consider
tightening monetary policy even further.''
   However, economists cautioned that despite indications of
weakness in some areas, the economy is still running at a high rate
of activity.
   ``The number in no way implies that inflation is set to move
lower on a permanent basis,'' Solloway said.

<HEAD>President Proposes `Open Skies' Policy With Soviets</HEAD>

unprecedented''; also moving general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today proposed an
``open skies'' policy with the Soviet Union, under which each
nation would be permitted to overfly the other's territory to
monitor military activities.
   In a major speech outlining his goal to ``welcome the Soviet
Union back into the world order,'' Bush also said he would be
willing to ease the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a 17-year-old law that
ties trade concessions to with East bloc nations with those
countries' emigration policies.
   ``The United States now has as its goal much more than simply
containing Soviet expansionism _ we seek the integration of the
Soviet Union into the community of nations,'' the president said in
the text of a speech announcing his administration's policy
principles for relations with Moscow.
   Bush took a carrot-and-stick approach to the Soviet Union in his
address to a commencement audience at Texas A&amp;M University, saying
he wanted the two superpowers to enjoy ``a friendship that knows no
season of suspicion, no chill of distrust.''
   `As the Soviet Union moves toward greater openness and
democratization, as they meet the challenge of responsible
international behavior, we will match their steps with steps of our
own,'' he said.
   ``Ultimately our objective is to welcome the Soviet Union back
into the world order.''
   Bush called for revival of a 1950s proposal by President
Eisenhower that would have allowed each nation to fly unarmed
inspection aircraft over the other's territory, which ``would open
up military activities to regular scrutiny.''
   Bush proposed that this never-implemented ``open skies'' policy
be expanded to include all nations in the East and West.
   ``Such unprecedented territorial access would show the world the
meaning of the concept of openness,'' he said. ``The very Soviet
willingness to embrace such a concept would reveal their commitment
to change.''
   En route here aboard Air Force One, national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft acknowledged to reporters that satellites conduct
most of the intelligence surveillance today. But he said the
open-skies use of aircraft would have some advantages in eeing
below cloud cover.
   And, Scowcroft said, ``Symbolically it's very important,''
because aerial surveillance would represent an abandonment of
traditional secrecy by the Soviets.
   ``This speech and the next one are not designed to be catchy,''
he said. ``We're in an unusual phase of history right now,'' and
the administration is trying to look ahead to end of the century
and develop new policies.
   As for the Jackson-Vanik law, Bush said he would work with
Congress for a `temporary waiver'' of the restrictions on Soviet
trade status, if the Kremlin would codify a liberalization of
emigration laws.
   He said his administration would respond positively if the
Soviets also ``take positive steps.''
   These, he said, include reducing their military forces abroad,
tearing down barriers between Eastern and Western Europe, improving
their human rights commitment and working with the West `in
positive, practical _ not merely rhetorical steps'' to solving
international regional disputes.
   `Where there is cooperation, there can be a broader economic
relationship ...,'' the president said. ``Ending discriminatory
treatment of U.S. firms would be a helpful step. Trade and
financial transactions should take place on a normal commercial
basis.''
   As he has in the past, Bush said he welcomed the Soviet moves
toward glasnost, or openness, and economic restructuring.
   But he sounded a skeptical note, saying these ``hopeful _ indeed
remarkable _ signs'' should be viewed in the vein that Western
security `is not predicated on hope. It must be based on deeds. We
look for enduring, ingrained economic and political change.''
   ``Make no mistake, a new breeze is blowing across the steppes
and cities of the Soviet Union. Why not, then, let this spirit of
openness grow, let more barriers come down,'' Bush said.
   He called for ``open emigration, open debate, open airwaves,''
and said: ``Let the 19,000 Soviet Jews who emigrated last year be
followed by any number who wish to emigrate this year.''
   The Jackson-Vanik measure, named for the late Sen. Henry M.
Jackson, D-Wash., and former Rep. Charles Vanik, R-Ohio, denies the
Soviets a host of trade advantages, including reduced tariffs,
unless they relax their restrictions on emigration of Jews and
others wishing to leave. It was included in a 1972 trade law.
   In advance of the speech, American Jewish groups gave a mixed
reaction to Bush's proposal to ease the measure.
   ``It's clearly a move that we would support,'' said Mark
Pelavin, a spokesman for the American Jewish Congress. ``We think
that the changes that have taken place in the Soviet Union are
changes we must recognize.''
   David Harris of the American Jewish Committee said the move
``sends the right combination of signals _ on the one hand, a
continued American insistence on performance by the Soviets; on the
other hand, an American willingness to respond to such performance
with flexibility.''
   The National Conference on Soviet Jewry was more cautious.
   ``Our official position is, we are against the waiver,'' said
spokesman Jerry Strober, adding that his group is ``reassessing its
view'' and may update it when its board of governors assembles in
Washington June 13.
   Strober said the conference recommends four criteria the Soviets
should meet before Jackson-Vanik is waived _ sustained and
substantial Jewish emigration, resolution of longstanding
refuseniks, the promise to codify emigration law, and specific time
limitations on refusals for reasons of state secrecy.
   The Soviets have been allowing expanded emigration through
case-by-case decisions, and the United States is looking for the
less restrictive rules to be put into more formal regulations.

   Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch household products
giant, said Friday its net profit rose 10 percent in the first
quarter, due to improvement in the company's operations outside
Europe.
   The company said its profit for the first three months of the
year came to 195 million pounds, which is about $326 million, or
10.44 pence a share, compared with 178 million pounds, or 9.53
pence a share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Sales rose 9 percent, to 4.33 billion pounds, about $7.2
billion, from 3.98 billion pounds a year earlier.
   Operating profit from Unilever's European businesses was little
changed at 205 million pounds, about $342 million, compared with
207 million pounds a year earlier, as mild weather cut into sales
of some food and drink products while promotional costs for some
detergent products increased.
   In North America, operating profit more than doubled to 66
million pounds, about $110 million, from 32 million pounds, helped
by first-time contributions from recent acquisitions of Durkee
Industrial Foods Corp. and Pennant Products Inc., a specialty
bakery products maker.
   Profit in the first quarter of 1988 was depressed by the
company's heavy investment to promote new detergent and dishwashing
brands, Unilever said.

<HEAD>OSHA Proposes Exposure Limits for Chemical Used in Construction</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday proposed setting
exposure limits for a substance used for various construction tasks
involving plastics and sealants and said the guidelines could
prevent up to 23 cancer deaths a year.
   The proposed limits on exposure to methylenedianiline resulted
from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's first
attempt at mediated rulemaking, a procedure which included a
committee consisting of government, industry and labor union
representatives.
   Methylenedianiline, known as MDA, is a potential carcinogen
found in chemicals and plastics such as polyurethane foam and
various coatings, resins, adhesives and sealants used in
construction.
   OSHA, an arm of the Labor Department, proposed setting an
exposure limit of 10 parts of MDA for every billion parts of air
over an normal eight-hour workday.
   The proposed guidelines, subject to public comment before they
take effect, also would require workers exposed to MDA at half the
acceptable level be monitored for potential health effects and
provided training on limiting their exposure.
   Workers exposed to MDA at half the acceptable limit or in
greater amounts would be required to shower immediately after work
and have their skin inspected for exposure. Prolonged exposure to
MDA turns skin yellow.
   Areas where the substance is used also would be regulated, with
employers required to provide workers with protective clothing and
respiratory equipment and to keep detailed records of MDA use.
   OSHA, which published the proposed limits in Friday's Federal
Register, said about 4,000 workers are exposed to MDA in their
jobs. It would cost an estimated $8.2 million a year for all firms
using MDA in general industry to meet the limits and about $650,000
a year for construction employers to comply, the government said.
   The process that led to the OSHA action dates back to 1983, when
OSHA and the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to
limit exposure to MDA. OSHA subsequently determined the substance
posed substantial risk to worker health and in 1986 formed the
committee that, after seven meetings, drafted the proposed limits.

<TEXT>
   LONDON (AP)
   The U.S. dollar rose Friday against most major
currencies in busy European trading despite what dealers said was
strong and concerted intervention by central banks. Gold prices
turned mixed.
   The dollar hovered at a 30-month high against the West German
mark in late trading, a 28-month high against the French franc, an
18-month high against the British pound and eight-month highs
against the Japanese yen and the French franc.
   Dealers said central banks sold dollars after the U.S.
government reported U.S. producer prices rose a modest 0.4 percent
in April. Market forecasts had predicted a 0.7-percent rise.
   But despite repeated interventions by the U.S. Federal Reserve,
aided by the West German, British, Swiss, French, Italian, Belgian
and Canadian central banks, the dollar had lost little ground by
the end of trading.
   The dollar's recovery was fueled bye Last Crusade,'' ``Ghostbusters
II,'' ``The
Karate Kid III'' or ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier''?
   All of them have a fighting chance, since all are sequels to
films that earned more than $100 million in the United States and
Canada. The film industry figures ``Indiana Jones'' and
``Ghostbusters II'' show the most promise for leading the pack,
along with a new version of ``Batman'' starring Michael Keaton and
Jack Nicholson.
   There are other deja vu offerings in this sequel summer:
   Timothy Dalton makes his second coming as James Bond in
``License to Kill.'' Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return to their
Los Angeles Police Department posts in ``Lethal Weapon II.''
Richard Chamberlain, Oliver Reed and Michael York play their old
roles in ``The Return of the Musketeers.'' There's also ``Friday
the 13th VIII'' and ``Nightmare on Elm Street V.''
   What makes a $100 million grosser?
   ``Number one, you need a broad opening in the summertime,'' said
Richard Lederer, who does marketing Warner Bros. and Orion
Pictures. ``You need anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 theaters
(Paramount has 2,000 for `Indiana Jones').
   ``It's important to open with a bang and continue to run for
weeks; you can't have a drop-off in the second or third week. If a
picture opens to medium business and starts to surprise, it's
important to add theaters right away. Summer is the important time,
and it's imperative to get as many theaters as possible.
   ``Most of the big winners are lighter fare, since that's what is
released during the summer. Strong dramas are usually held for
December.''
   A survey of the $100 million movies of the past five years bears
out Lederer's theories. The only drama on the list is the Academy
Award-winning ``Rain Man,'' which has earned $160 million since its
release last December.
   Here is how the other $100 million movies of the past five years
break down (figures in millions from Exhibitor Relations Co.):
   Comedies and comedy-adventures: ``Ghostbusters'' (1984, $221);
``Beverly Hills Cop'' (1984, $230); ``Back to the Future'' (1985,
$220); ``Crocodile Dundee'' (1986, $175); ``Good Morning, Vietnam''
(1987, $125); ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' (1987, $154); ``Three Men
and a Baby'' (1987, $168); ``Twins'' (1988, $103); ``Crocodile
Dundee II'' (1988, $109); ``Big'' (1988, $113); ``Coming to
America'' (1988, $128); ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'' (1988, $153).
   Action-adventures and Fantasies: ``Gremlins'' (1984, $148);
``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' (1984, $175); ``Rambo II''
(1985, $150); ``Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986, $109);
``Platoon'' (1985, $137); ``Top Gun'' (1986, $177).
   Thriller: ``Fatal Attraction'' (1987, $157).
   As usual, comedies will be prevalent during the 1989 summer.
   ``Eric the Viking,'' is a spoof from Monty Python's Terry Jones
with Tim Robbins, John Cleese and Mickey Rooney.
   ``Do the Right Thing,'' is another outrageous comedy from Spike
Lee (``School Daze''), starring Danny Aiello.
   ``Uncle Buck,'' stars John Candy and Amy Madigan in a John
Hughes film.
   ``Parenthood,'' features Steve Martin, Tom Hulce and Rick
Moranis, and is directed by Ron Howard (''Cocoon.'')
   ``Weekend at Bernie's,'' is a murder caper with Andrew McCarthy
and Jonathan Silverman.
   ``Turner &amp; Hooch,'' stars Oscar nominee Tom Hanks as a
by-the-book cop, and like the current ``K-9,'' his partner is a dog.
   ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' is a courtship comedy from Rob
Reiner (``Stand by Me''), with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.
   The action-adventure junkies will find satisfaction in the
summer fare, aside from Indiana Jones, James Bond, Ghostbusters and
Musketeers, there are the following:
   James Cameron (``Aliens'') is delving into ``The Abyss,'' with
Ed Harris plunging 25,000 feet below the Atlantic Ocean. Kris
Kristofferson and Cheryl Ladd go time-traveling in ``Millenium.''
Clint Eastwood returns as a fugitive on the trail of bail-jumper
Bernadette Peters in ``Pink Cadillac.''
   The Vietnam War is once again explored in ``Casualties of War''
with Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox. Kiefer Sutherland and Lou
Diamond Phillips are a mismatched pair seeking revenge against a
savage murderer in ``Renegades.'' Patrick Swayze plays a legendary
troubleshooter in ``Road House.''
   Dramatic fare won't be entirely overlooked during the
hot-weather months. Robin Williams goes straight as a charismatic
schoolteacher in Australia in ``Dead Poets Society.'' Tom Selleck
seeks vindication after being wrongly sentenced to prison in ``Hard
Rain,'' not to be confused with ``Black Rain,'' with Michael
Douglas as a New York detective delving into the Osaka underworld.
   For Jerry Lee Lewis fans, Randy Quaid will portray the keyboard
thumper in ``Great Balls of Fire,'' the only film resembling a
musical this summer.
   And there's not much for the wee ones, except for a rerelease of
Disney's classic ``Peter Pan.''

<HEAD>A Political Myth That Taxes The Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like turning over a rock, you never know what
might be exposed to the sunshine when you tip a political
assumption on its side and get a good look at it.
   Ron Utt did and what he found is not at all what he was supposed
to find, and because of that a currently popular political view has
lost some of its credibility.
   That political view, often garnished with emotion, is that a cut
in the capital gains tax, as proposed by President Bush, would
enrich the rich at the expense of the poor.
   The reasoning involved is that only those with big incomes are
likely to have capital gains, such as from stocks or real estate,
because those on limited incomes cannot afford such capitalistic
luxuries.
   Isn't that what the earnings statistics show?
   No, says Utt, former deputy director of the Office of Management
and Budget and now a fellow at the conservative Heritage
Foundation. That might be what the statistics seem to show, but
only because of rather odd methodology, he says.
   What makes it appear that only the rich have capital gains _ and
therefore can be the only beneficiaries of cuts in the capital
gains tax _ is that every so often those on limited incomes are
treated as if they were rich.
   For many individuals, even those on incomes of less than
$10,000, capital gains realizations are infrequent occurrences and
reflect a unique, one-time event that pushes the taxpayer into
higher brackets _ for one year.
   In the next year, the poor taxpayer might revert to the usual
under-$10,000 income, but only after he or she has left an imprint
on the previous year's statistics, and thereby helped ``prove'' an
ersatz point.
   Utt explains: Realized capital gains tend often to be such
non-recurring events as the sale of a small business on retirement,
an elderly widow selling her home, the sale of stock to pay for a
child's education, the sale of a small portfolio that might have
represented the meager savings of a lifetime.
   Among these one-time capital gainers are spouses of broken
marriages, who might have put all their money into a home, after
which real estate values soared. Now they are selling and dividing
the assets. Are they rich?
   Prominent among those who might have capital gains are the
elderly, who often sell their houses and move into smaller
quarters. In general, they seek to live off their nest egg. Are
they rich, or only taxed as if they were?
   In a Heritage Foundation paper supporting a cut in capital gains
taxes, and in an interview, Utt cited 1985 Internal Revenue Service
figures to show that those on small incomes pay a huge amount in
capital gains taxes.
   The chart shows those people with annual income of less than
$10,000, other than from capital gains, paid $35.3 billion in
capital gains taxes, or 20.79 percent of all capital gains taxes
paid in that year.
   That amount was the largest for any income category other than
for the unlimited ``over $200,000'' group. Even those with
non-capital gains income of $150,000 to $200,000 paid only $8.7
billion, or 5.12 percent of the total.
   It is extremely important, says Utt, to measure ``recurring''
income, or the income a taxpayer can expect year to year.
   When the distinction between recurring income and nest egg
income is made, he says, ``it can be seen that realized capital
gains actually are distributed rather evenly throughout the income
distribution.''
   But if you include those who are ``rich'' for just one year,
then of course the statistics will tend to show that only those who
are fairly well off pay capital gains taxes.

   Stock prices were approaching new highs in
active trading today after the better-than-expected producer price
report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 44.91 points to
2,427.79 at 2 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 38.86 at
noon after jumping about 45 points after the opening.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 13 to 4 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,116 issues up, 351 down and 451
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 157.99 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported today that the producer price
index rose 0.4 percent in April, the same as in March, despite a
sharp increase in energy prices. The market had expected a bigger
increase.
   Traders interpreted the report to mean a further softening of
the economy and an easing of inflationary pressures.
   ``The reason why the market is responding so positively to the
data is people were bracing for the worst,'' said James Solloway,
director of economic research at Argus Research Corp. ``The fact
that we had just a 0.4 percent increase in producer prices despite
the massive 7 percent rise in energy prices is a very good
development. It takes the pressure off the Fed to consider
tightening monetary policy even further.''
   However, economists cautioned that despite indications of
weakness in some areas, the economy is still running at a high rate
of activity.
   ``The number in no way implies that inflation is set to move
lower on a permanent basis,'' Solloway said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 2.60 to 174.31.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had risen

<HEAD>Texas Instruments Announces Taiwanese Chip Production Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc. on Friday announced the
creation of a privately held joint venture with Taiwan's Acer Inc.
to produce advanced memory chips in Taiwan.
   The venture will give Dallas-based Texas Instruments its first
memory-chip production capacity in the Asia-Pacific region outside
of Japan, the company said.
   It also will provide Acer, Taiwan's largest computer
manufacturer, an assured source of dynamic random access memory
chips, or DRAMs, for its personal computers, peripherals and
communications products, the company said.
   DRAMs are tiny silicon circuits used in computers and other
electronic devices.
   Representatives of both companies announced the venture Friday
in Taipei, Taiwan. Construction of the $250 million wafer
fabrication plant is scheduled to start in September, with initial
production in mid-1991.
   Output from the facility will be sold exclusively to Texas
Instruments, which will guarantee up to 50 percent of the total to
Acer.
   Acer will own 74 percent of the company, while TI will own 26
percent. TI will have an option to buy up to 51 percent during the
next five years.
   The Taiwanese company will put up the majority of cash to fund
the company, and TI will provide a lesser amount of money plus the
technology to build and run the plant.
   ``Customers are looking for a long-term source of product, and
they want closer relationships with their memory suppliers,'' said
William P. ``Pat'' Weber, president of TI's semiconductor group.
   ``This joint venture provides that kind of relationship between
Acer and TI,'' he said. ``It will give us some much-needed
production capacity in a key location, and it spreads the financial
risk inherent in building new increments of capacity.''
   Stan Shih, Acer's chairman and chief executive officer, will
serve as chairman of the joint venture.
   Application-specific integrated circuits also may be
manufactured by the new company in the future, according to TI
officials.

<TEXT>
   Share prices surged Friday to close at a new
post-crash high on the London Stock Exchange after the release of
better-than-expected U.S. inflation figures fueled optimism about
the outlook for interest rates.
   The apparently brighter picture for interest rates should prompt
further rises in share prices in the near term, dealers predicted.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 25.1 points, or 1.2 percent, at 2,135.7, surpassing the
previous post-crash closing peak of 2,132.8 reached last Friday.
   The index moved in positive territory all day, showing a gain of
just 3.4 points in early trading before rallying to a maximum net
rise of 26.3 points at mid-afternoon.
   Volume jumped to 532.7 million shares from 430.5 million on
Thursday.
   The U.S. government reported that its producer-price index rose
0.4 percent in April, about half the expected increase.
   ``People are saying, `There is now no possibility of the (U.S.
Federal Reserve) raising rates for the foreseeable future,' and
although that doesn't directly relate to U.K. rates, it certainly
helps,'' said a salesman at a major British brokerage firm.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 20.4 points at 1,779.1
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 12.78 points
to close at 1,209.70.

<HEAD>Crop Futures End Widely Mixed On Weather, USDA Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade on a combination of bearish
weather forecasts and bullish signals from the Agriculture
Department's latest crop report.
   Wheat futures ended lower. The corn and soybean markets both
finished with higher prices for old-crop deliveries and losses in
the new-crop contracts.
   The drop in wheat prices reflected the arrival of badly needed
rain in the parched winter wheat fields of the southern Plains.
   ``These rains are going to do good,'' said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   The USDA, in a crop report issued after Thursday's close of
trading, estimated an 8 percent decline in 1989 winter wheat
production from last year's level. But the the market had already
discounted the crop damage and traders focused instead on the
weather.
   The USDA lowered to 135 million bushels from 145 million bushels
its projection for the Aug. 31 U.S. soybean stockpile, which
supported prices for beans from last year's crop.
   Strong spot markets boosted the old-crop corn contracts, while
forecasts for favorable planting weather this weekend prompted
selling of new-crop corn and soybeans.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents to 5{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.22{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
lower o 2\ cents higher with May at $2.78{ a bushel; oats were 2}
cents to 5 cents higher with May at $1.89{ a bushel; soybeans were
4{ cents lower to 7 cents higher with May at $7.58{ a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Former British Columbia
premier Bill Bennett was found innocent Friday of insider trading
in shares of Doman Industries.
   Provincial Court Judge Wallace Craig also acquitted Bennett's
brother Russell and Herb Doman, president of the Vancouver
Island-based forest company, in Canada's highest-profile insider
trading case.
   ``I've said all along that I've done nothing wrong,'' Doman said
after the verdict. ``Now I can go on and run my business.''
   The three, prominent businessmen drawn together by ties to
horse-racing and the Social Credit political party, faced up to
$100,000 in fines and five years in jail.
   Each was charged with one count each of selling shares using
information not disclosed to the public. Russell Bennett and Doman
also faced one count of buying shares on the basis of inside
information. Doman faced one count each of tipping someone to buy
and sell using inside information.
   The Bennetts still face insider trading charges in Toronto.
   Bill Bennett, 57, was British Columbia premier from 1975 until
retiring in May 1986. His father, W.A.C. Bennett, led the
provincial government for 20 years, ending in 1972.
   Judge Craig said prosecutors had failed to prove the case beyond
a reasonable doubt.
   ``Not only has the prosecution failed to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that Bill Bennett's sale of (Doman's) shares was
as a result of Herb Doman giving him inside information, it has
established at least on a balance of probabilities that he made the
decision to do so before he could possible have received any
alleged tip,'' he said.

   Stock prices surged in heavy trading today,
ending the day at new post-crash highs after a government report on
wholesale prices eased investor fears about inflation.
   Prices spurted at the opening as traders shook off the fears
that had held the market back all week, keeping many players on the
sidelines.
   The market stabilized at the higher level during the trading
session until a last-minute buying spree in the final hour pushed
prices up further.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index rose
0.4 percent in April, the same as in March, despite a sharp
increase in energy prices. The index measures prices at the
wholesale level.
   The market had expected a rise of as high as 1 percent.
   Investors decided the report meant that inflationary pressures
were not building as suggested by last week's unemployment report
and that the Federal Reserve might not continue raising interest
rates. The April jobless report showed more people were out of work
but at the same time hourly earnings climbed substantially.
   ``The fear until now was not that the economy would overheat but
that inflation would rise rapidly and keep the Fed from making
moves to ease credit,'' said Michael Metz, technical analyst for
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``Now it looks like that has changed.''
   However, economists cautioned that despite indications of
weakness in some areas, the economy is still running at a high rate
of activity.
   ``The number in no way implies that inflation is set to move

<HEAD>Alar Costs Growers $90 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Alar scare has already cost Washington
apple growers $90 million this year, and slumping prices and sales
reported Friday indicate losses will be even higher.
   Sales dropped 15 percent last week, while prices have slumped
another $1 per box, both attributed to continuing public concern
over the possible health effects of the farm chemical.
   The outlook is even gloomier because round two of the Alar
controversy is about to begin, with more news reports, a
congressional hearing and movement by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency toward banning the chemical.
   Bill DeWitt of the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association reported
Friday that out-of-state shipments of Washington apples were 1.2
million 42-pound boxes during the week that ended Thursday.
   That compared to nearly 1.5 million boxes the week before, and
nearly 1.7 million boxes the same week last year.
   Shipments to retailers are considered an accurate indicator of
consumer sales.
   Tom Hale, president of the Washington State Apple Commission,
has attributed the decline to retailers dropping their inventories
until the impact of the latest Alar battle becomes clear.
   The industry is anxiously awaiting another Alar report on the
CBS television program ``60 Minutes,'' scheduled for this Sunday.
The show's story on the NRDC report in late February sparked the
controversy.
   The industry has contacted people interviewed for the second
``60 Minutes'' story and believes it will be a negative piece.
   ``It's an attempt to offset the broad criticism the original
segment had,'' said Hale, who heads the promotion group for the
state's 5,000 growers.
   Also set for next week are congressional hearings on food safety
that will focus on Alar. And the EPA announced Thursday that it
plans to begin formal steps to ban Alar within 10 days.
   The NRDC report concluded that eating apples treated with Alar,
the trade name for daminozide, increased cancer risk in children.
   The industry has attacked the report as misleading, and federal
regulators have pronounced apples safe to eat, but alarmed
consumers have backed away.
   Alar is sprayed on apple trees in the spring and is used
primarily to improve color and crispness and extend shelf life of
red apples.
   Washington grows about half the nation's apples, but provides 88
percent of the domestic production this time of year. The state's
growers have been hardest hit by the controversy.
   Prices, which were $13 to $14 per box just before the
controversy erupted in late February, have dropped to around $10
per box in recent weeks, said Jeff Main of the federal-state Market
News Service in Yakima.
   With about 30 million boxes of red apples sold since late
February, the cost to Washington growers about $90 million.
   Those losses are partially offset by increases in prices for
much smaller supplies of Golden Delicious and Granny Smith apples.
   Warehouses in the state still have over 13 million boxes of red
apples left in storage, 3 million more than at this time last year.
   ``If we don't sell all of these, which is a possibility, we will
lose much more,'' DeWitt said.
   Earlier this week, John Rice, president of the International
Apple Institute, estimated that the controversy had cost growers
across the nation $100 million, with another $100 million lost by
juice and applesauce processors.
   The sales slowdown also means that stored fruit, which normally
would have been sold a month ago, is becoming unsuitable for
supermarkets and must be diverted at a much lower price to juice
and sauce makers.

<HEAD>Ogilvy Group in Takeover Talks With WPP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ogilvy Group Inc. has begun talks with Britain's
WPP Group PLC, which has offered to buy the American advertising
company for about $800 million but indicated it may increase its
bid, the companies said Friday.
   Ogilvy said in disclosing the talks that there was no guarantee
the discussions would produce an agreement on WPP acquiring Ogilvy,
the world's fifth-largest advertising concern.
   A combination of WPP and Ogilvy would create a company that
would vie with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC for the ranking as the
world's largest advertising company.
   Takeover speculators on Wall Street have expected WPP to make a
more generous offer in an effort to avoid the costly delays and
potential client losses that could occur due to a result of a
hostile transaction.
   In over-the-counter trading Friday, Ogilvy shares rose $1.25 a
share to $53.12{.
   Analysts took a cautious approach toward interpreting the
significance of the discussions.
   Andrew Wallach, who follows advertising agencies for Drexel
Burnham Lambert, said it may be ``a signal that in all probability
we will see an agreed transaction.'' But, he quickly added, ``you
can't rule out anything at this point.''
   Fred Anschel, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the
Ogilvy announcement ``suggests they have no other feasible options
available to them.'' Ogilvy reportedly has considered seeking a
friendly buyout by another company, a management-led buyout or a
recapitalization.
   But another securities analyst, speaking on condition that he
not be identified, said Ogilvy management may be talking with WPP
simply to gather information in advance of a regular board meeting,
set for Tuesday.
   A statement issued by Ogilvy said any agreement between the two,
which would have to be approved by both companies' boards, would be
contingent upon certain unspecified conditions.
   In London, WPP confirmed in a one-sentence statement that
``discussions are in progress ... regarding the possible
acquisition of Ogilvy by WPP.''
   London-based WPP, the world's third-largest advertising company
and parent of the U.S. agency J. Walter Thompson, opened the
bidding for Ogilvy two weeks ago when it proposed a friendly buyout
at $45 a share. Earlier this week, WPP said it would be willing to
pay $50 a share.
   Ogilvy has about 16 million shares outstanding on a fully
diluted basis, making WPP's current offer worth about $800 million.
   Purchasing Ogilvy would make WPP nearly equal in size to
industry leader Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Saatchi had worldwide billings
of $13.5 billion last year, while WPP had $7.8 billion and Ogilvy
came in at $5.7 billion.
   Ogilvy's Ogilvy &amp; Mather ad agency is recognized as one of the
most famous names in advertising and counts among its clients
American Express, Seagram Co. and the Kraft General Foods unit of
Philip Morris Cos.
   But analysts have faulted Ogilvy for below-average operating
margins. Ogilvy executives insist that margins in its advertising
agency are near the industry average of about 10 percent but that
its research operations have depressed companywide margins.
   WPP is led by Martin Sorrell, who is credited as the architect
of the acquisition strategy that made Saatchi the world's biggest
ad company.
   After leaving Saatchi, he applied what he had learned in
building WPP from a small maker of shopping baskets to a global
consortium of advertising, public relations, sales promotion and
marketing services companies.
   His boldest move was two years ago when WPP successfully
acquired JWT Group Inc., the parent of J. Walter Thompson and the
smaller ad agency Lord Geller Federico Einstein and the public
relations giant Hill &amp; Knowlton. It was the first hostile
acquisition in the American ad business and cost $566 million.
   Analysts say Sorrell prizes Ogilvy's brand name and its
strengths in Europe, where Thompson is weaker. They say Ogilvy also
would give Sorrell a second global ad company to be run
independently of Thompson much as Saatchi and other advertising
behemoths run separate global ad networks.

<HEAD>Voice Behind `Sleeping Beauty' Sues Disney For Royalties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The voice of the princess in the
1959 animated classic ``Sleeping Beauty'' is suing Walt Disney Co.
for something no one envisioned when the movie was made _ videotape
royalties.
   New York attorney Glenn Every called the lawsuit filed Thursday
in Palm Beach Circuit Court ``a straightforward contractual
dispute'' between Disney and his client, opera singer Mary Costa,
who sang and spoke the words of the princess.
   ``She had agreed with the Disney people to provide her services
as a singer, and the Disney people agreed that they would not make
recordings or a transcription without her permission, and they
haven't paid royalties,'' Every said.
   In Ms. Costa's 1952 contract with Disney, the company agreed not
to ``make phonograph recordings and-or transcriptions for sale to
the public.''
   The suit contends videocassettes fit that description, and the
Palm Beach soprano is seeking royalties from videocassette sales.
   Another of her attorneys says the ``Sleeping Beauty'' video has
been a big seller since it went on sale in October 1986.
   ``It's sold over 1.8 million in Italy alone,'' said Christopher
Larmoyeux, ``so you can imagine the income.''
   In November, singer Peggy Lee filed a similar lawsuit. She
co-wrote the lyrics and performed on the soundtrack of Disney's
1955 film ``Lady and the Tramp.''
   Lee claimed she hadn't gotten any money from sales of nearly 4
million videocassettes of that movie. Her case is still pending in
California.
   Disney representatives in California don't want to talk about
Costa's suit.
   ``We're not going to comment on anything that is in
litigation,'' said company spokesman Mike Ferguson.
   Disney has been embroiled in several legal controversies
recently. The company sued the producers of the Academy Awards for
unauthorized use of the character Snow White in a song-and-dance
number and a Broward County day care center to remove murals of
Disney characters from its walls.

   remove reference to 30 day
   NORTHPORT, N.Y. (AP) _ What's in a name? Well, according to
International Business Machines Corp., that depends on what you're
selling.
   IBM has told a Long Island computer company called Big Blue
Products Inc. to find a new name or face legal action for trademark
infringement. ``Big Blue'' is a trademark long associated with IBM,
said company spokeswoman Rita Black.
   But Jeff Alnwick, owner of the 5-year-old company, says other
firms have used the Big Blue name without any problem _ and Black
agrees. If you're just selling wine, ``Big Blue'' is fine, she said.
   Why?
   ``We don't make wine,'' said Black, adding the corporation knew
about and had no problem with the ``Big Blue'' brew marketed by the
Rivendell Winery in New Paltz.
   Alnwick's firm _ which has five employees and does about $3
million business per year _ distributes computer products to office
machine dealers. He claims IBM representatives have seen him at
trade shows and thought his name was cute.
   But IBM officials weren't laughing when they notified Alnwick he
had 30 days to submit plans detailing how he would go about
changing the name and when that change will be complete. Alnwick,
who accused IBM of bullying him, vowed to fight for his right to
use the name.
   ``I guess I'll have to hire an attorney to fight this. I can't
afford to, but what choice do I have?'' Alnwick asked.
   The Long Island businessman may have a tough fight in court, but
he has at least one supporter already _ Bob Ransom, owner of the
Rivendell Winery.
   ``His is a real David and Goliath story. Now that he has an
established business they are looking to squash it,'' said Ransom.

<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices climbed a moderate 0.4
percent in April despite a steep rise in gasoline costs, the
government said Friday, cheering financial markets and providing
hope that inflation has stopped accelerating.
   Energy prices soared 7.2 percent, propelled by the steepest
one-month increase in gasoline prices in nearly 2{ years. Those
rises were largely offset, however, by a broad fall in food prices,
the first real breather since last year's drought, and by a
substantial decline in auto costs.
   The news rallied stock and bond markets, where traders said the
report indicated the Federal Reserve Board's yearlong campaign of
fighting inflation with higher interest rates is working. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials surged 56.82 points to close at a
post-crash high of 2,439.70.
   ``This is an excellent report,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg
of Merrill Lynch. ``I think it would be premature to declare
victory over inflation, but the report does suggest we won't see
any more acceleration and that the Fed is unlikely to tighten
more.''
   But the Business Council, a group of 65 chief executives from
the nation's largest corporations, said Friday they foresee little
deceleration either.
   ``The central view is that although the flare-up in prices early
in 1989 was an aberration, price behavior will not improve
appreciably until mid-1990,'' the executives said in a report
released at their semi-annual retreat in Hot Springs, Va., a posh
resort town.
   The April advance in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
for finished goods, one stop short of retail, followed an identical
0.4 percent gain in March and 1 percent jumps in January and
February.
   Because of the steep rises early in the year, wholesale prices
increased at a 9 percent annual rate in the first four months of
1989. That's more than double last year's wholesale inflation of 4
percent and four times the 2.2 percent rate in 1987.
   However, economists said much _ but not all _ of the
acceleration this year is attributable to a one-time shock from a
rise of more than 30 percent in the price of crude oil since the
end of 1988.
   ``We'll see an increase in (energy) prices next month, but not
of this magnitude,'' said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia
State University. ``Our feeling is they will fall off in the second
half of the year.''
   The huge 7.2 percent rise in energy costs last month was almost
entirely attributable to a 13.4 percent climb in gasoline prices,
the steepest since January 1987. Fuel oil prices rose a
comparatively moderate 0.6 percent after zooming ahead 16.8 percent
in March. Natural gas prices advanced 1.9 percent.
   A 0.6 percent decline in food costs, led by a 15.9 percent drop
for eggs, was the biggest since December 1987. Vegetables fell 7.5
percent; pork, 3.6 percent; fruit, 2.7 percent; and fish, 1.3
percent. The prices of turkeys, rice and candy rose.
   ``We've pretty much topped out on the drought,'' Ratajczak said.
``Barring another drought, we're going to get more up-and-down
rather than steady up.''
   Economists were particularly encouraged by the April inflation
rate for goods outside of the volatile food and energy categories.
Those prices overall edged down 0.1 percent, the first drop since
October 1987, following a 0.3 percent rise in March.
   The biggest drop came in autos, where prices fell 2.8 percent,
the result of manufacturers' incentives to lure customers into
showrooms and revive slumping sales.
   There were also declines in children's clothing, cosmetics,
magazines and tires. Prices rose for jewelry and electronic
equipment.
   The overall April increase left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 113.0, meaning that a hypothetical selection of
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $113 last month, up from
$112.20 in March.
   Measures of inflation earlier in the production process also
showed moderation. Intermediate goods rose 0.4 percent in April
following a 0.7 percent jump in March. Crude goods rose 0.6 percent
following a 2.3 percent gain.
   An example of the three processing levels would be wholesale
bread at the finished level, flour at the intermediate and wheat at
the crude.
   Economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago
said Friday's producer price figures reinforce analysts'
expectations that Federal Reserve policymakers will vote to hold
interest rates steady when they meet in private next Tuesday to set
monetary policy through June.
   ``One thing you can be sure of,'' he said. ``For the first time
in a long time, they're not going to be asking themselves whether
they should be tightening. I think the basic thing the Fed will do
is say, `All right, we seem to be making progress.''
   In a separate report Friday, the Commerce Department said
business inventories in March rose 0.3 percent while sales were
flat, confirming earlier government statistics showing economic
growth slowing.

   The energy futures market closed narrowly mixed
in dull trading Friday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled
3 cents higher at $20.09 a barrel after rising 54 cents on
Thursday. All other contracts were lower, however.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, June
heating oil, which rose 1.20 cents on Thursday, gained another 0.42
cent to finish at 49.10 cents a gallon.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery slipped 0.27 cent
to 67.01 cents a gallon. On Thursday the near-term contract soared
2.56 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said gasoline prices were negatively affected by
legislation introduced in the House of Representatives late in the
day proposing to hike the federal gasoline tax by 9 cents a gallon.
According to Rep. Jim Moody, D-Wis., who introduced the bill, the
roughly $9 billion in annual proceeds would be used to help cut the
federal deficit.
   ``That put downward pressure on gas,'' said William Byers, an
analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. The current federal gasoline tax
amounts to 9.1 cents per gallon.
   While the bill gave dealers a reason to sell, analysts noted
that trading was mostly quiet all day.
   ``It's just deadly dull,'' Byers said. The market's attention is
turning to the upcoming meeting next month of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, Austria.

<HEAD>Fast-Food Giant Selling $100 Million New Issue to ESOP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp. announced plans Friday
to sell $100 million of a new issue of preferred stock to its
Employee Stock Ownership Plan to increase employee holdings.
   ``This transaction is a continuation of a long-held strategy and
tradition established by our founder (the late) Ray Kroc of
encouraging employee share ownership,'' said Fred L. Turner,
chairman of the fast-food giant.
   The ESOP can borrow long-term funds and purchase stock at
current prices ``to help our employees own more stock in the
company,'' he said. ``It will not increase the company's total
employee-benefit costs.''
   The new issue is convertible into less than 1 percent of
outstanding common shares, McDonald's said. The preferred's
dividend and coversion ratio will be determined at the time of sale
based on market conditions, and each share will have one vote.
   Selling stock into an employee ownership plan has become popular
among corporations because it cuts the company's tax bill while
erecting a new takeover defense. Employees who own stock are
considered more inclined to side with the company in a takeover
battle, choosing long-term gains over a short-term windfall.
   Such concerns were not at issue in this case, said McDonald's
spokesman Chuck Ebeling.
   ``I don't think that has anything to do with it,'' Ebeling said.
   The sale ``only represents 1 percent of outstanding common
shares. I'm told that's not significant enough'' to thwart a
takeover attempt, he said.
   The company's ESOP is distinctive for its ``breadth of coverage.
Our restaurant managers and full-time restaurant crew all
participate,'' Turner said.
   ``This transaction will help to achieve our long-term goal of
increasing stock ownership among the largest number of employees.''
   The ESOP intends to borrow the money needed to purchase the
stock under a $300 million shelf registration filed Friday with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said.
   McDonald's says it is the world's largest food-service
organization, serving 22 million people each day in more than
10,500 restaurants in 50 countries. Three-quarters of its
restaurant businesses are locally owned and operated by independent
entrepreneurs.

   Federal regulators said Friday they will draft
new rules designed to protect savings institutions from hostile
takeovers after they convert from the mutual form of ownership to
stock ownership.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it has directed its staff
to rewrite the agency's rules to make the hostile intent of an S&amp;L
stock buyer one of the grounds for denial of an application for
three years after an institution converts from mutal to stock
ownership. The bank board normally has authority to decide who may
own a thrift institution.
   The move comes after the board denied investor groups permission
to acquire more than 10 percent of the stock of two institutions,
Gateway Federal Savings and Loan Association of Cincinnati, and
Home Unity Savings and Loan Association of Lafayette Hill, Pa. The
institutions said the purchase efforts were unsolicited.
   The board said hostile takeovers ``divert managerial resources''
and would discourage S&amp;Ls from converting from mutual to stock
ownership.

   The dollar bobbed up to its highest level in
months Friday in spite of an adverse economic report and persistent
efforts by central banks to knock it down.
   The U.S. currency fell and then rose in heavy trading, ending
around a 30-month high against the West German mark, a 28-month
high against the French franc, an 18-month high against the British
pound and eight-month highs against the Japanese yen and the French
franc.
   ``Volatile is an understatement'' for the day's trading, said
Kevin Lawrie, senior foreign-exchange manager for Bank of Boston in
New York.
   The dollar dropped in the morning after a Labor Department
report that wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in April, below the
market's expectations.
   Traders sold dollars thinking that U.S. interest rates might
decline, which could make global investors switch their money to
other currencies.
   Central banks of the United States, Canada and Europe seized the
opportunity to sell dollars themselves, driving the currency still
lower. But the decline ran out of momentum in early afternoon and
the dollar quickly shot back up.
   Traders said the dollar's rise came from persistent, underlying
bullish sentiment that was undeterred by the inflation report and
the central banks. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 135.80 Japanese
yen, up from 134.55 yen Thursday. Later, in London, it edged up
further to 135.90 yen. In New York the dollar rose to 136.11 yen
from 135.38 late Thursday.
   The British pound fell against the dollar in London to $1.6615,
down from $1.6655 late Thursday. The pound also fell against the
dollar in New York, to $1.6615 from $1.6645.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late rates on
Thursday included: 1.9195 West German marks, up from 1.9161; 1.7175
Swiss francs, up from 1.7080; 1.1880 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1871; 6.4880 French francs, up from 6.4755; and 1,398.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,395.75.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates on Thursday
included: 1.9195 German marks, up from 1.9135; 1.7080 Swiss francs,
up from 1.7060; 6.4870 French francs, up from 6.4665; 2.1407 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1580; 1,385.50 Italian lire, down from
1,395.75; and, 1.1868 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1870.
   Gold bullion rose in Zurich to a late bid price of $379.25 a
troy ounce, up from $378.20 bid late Thursday.
   In London, gold fell to $377 bid, down from $379 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.30 an ounce to close at a
bid of $380.26.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $377.90 a troy ounce from $381. Gold had been
bolstered Thursday by investors who used it as a haven because of
tension over Panama.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at
$376.25 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $379.40 late Thursday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.63 a
troy ounce, down from $5.66 bid late Thursday. On New York's Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery fell to $5.535 from $5.65 on
Thursday.

<HEAD>A New, Tougher Generation of Anti-Takeover Laws</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Almost like generals shoring up the front lines,
state legislatures are sending in fresh ammunition to aid
corporations battling hostile takeovers: new laws aimed at
hindering unwanted assaults.
   Aided by recent key court rulings in favoring such legislation,
the states increasingly have enacted new or toughened existing
anti-takeover laws to protect companies facing real or potential
hostile buyouts.
   ``Each new wave is getting tougher,'' Frederick Lipman, a
partner with the law firm Blank, Rome, Comisky &amp; McCauley in
Philadelphia, said of the statutes.
   That toughness has grown out of anger, Lipman said. Takeovers
have cost the states thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in
revenue in cases where new owners closed plants and laid off
workers.
   Some of the most aggressive laws have emerged in states where
labor carries a lot of political clout, such as Pennsylvania and
Ohio. Laws in these states generally allow directors to consider
the welfare of employees and the community when the boards decide
whether to accept or reject a takeover bid.
   The Ohio statute is broadest, allowing directors to also
consider a company's suppliers, creditors and customers, the local
and national economy and social concerns.
   ``What you're basically saying is you don't have to look to the
shareholders' interest'' alone, Lipman said.
   States have had anti-takeover laws for years. But since April
1987, aided by a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the
legislatures have become more assertive in acting to protect local
companies.
   The nation's highest court on April 21, 1987 upheld an Indiana
anti-takeover statute and the right of the states to enact laws to
protect their corporations from hostile suitors.
   Analysts then correctly predicted there would be an explosion of
state anti-takeover statutes. Since the Supreme Court announced its
decision, more than half the states have passed new laws regulating
takeovers.
   But experts say growing public sentiment against takeovers has
given the latest statutes their muscle.
   Linda Quinn, director of the Division of Corporate Finance for
the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a recent summary of
state anti-takeover law developments that Delaware's new statute _
copied with some modifications by other states _ may be the most
significant of the new laws.
   The Delaware statute enacted last year generally restricts the
completion of a merger for three years if there is no board
approval and if the hostile takeover is not approved by 85 percent
of the shareholders. If an acquirer cannot complete the merger, it
means company assets cannot be sold to help finance the deal.
   Many U.S. corporations, including more than half the Fortune 500
companies, are incorporated in Delaware. More significantly,
Polaroid Corp. proved earlier this year that the state's law works.
   Polaroid used it as the basis for a successful defense against
an unwanted bid from Shamrock Holdings Inc. The instant-photography
company placed enough stock in friendly hands to virtually
guarantee that Shamrock would be unable to immediately complete a
merger.
   Polaroid's deft use of the law has given other states food for
thought _ but analysts say anti-takeover laws are not a panacea.
   ``I don't think any of these laws are going to automatically
prevent takeovers,'' said attorney Lipman. ``They're just one more
weapon in the arsenal of management.''
   Donald Margotta, a professor at Northeastern University in
Boston, said many of the tougher laws have been on the books for a
year or more and generally have not deterred prospective acquirers.
   ``They might require that people change some of their financing
techniques or their strategies subsequent to taking control of a
companies,'' Margotta said. ``We might see companies running their
targets as subsidiaries rather than doing a merger.''
   Some of the new laws also include provisions that seek to
curtail the growth of leveraged buyouts, transactions accomplished
primarily through the use of borrowed money.
   Such deals have come under attack by politicians and others
following the record $24.53 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco
Inc., on the grounds that such heavy debt loads are bad for
businesses and the economy.
   One of the new statutes, part of New York's Business Corporation
Law, restricts an acquirer's ability to use of a target company's
tax losses. It also limits in highly-leveraged transactions the
acquirer's ability to deduct the resulting interest expenses. The
law covers state taxes only, but is an idea that Congress is
contemplating for the federal tax code.
   Evan Weiss, counsel to New York governor Mario Cuomo, said
officials are concerned about the impact that heavy borrowing may
have on a company's business. They claim it discourages long-term
research and development spending and job expansion.
   Weiss said that even if a company is not under direct attack,
``everybody's leveraging themselves to death to make themselves
unattractive to raiders.''
   Margotta said laws like the New York statute make it more
difficult to do a typical highly-leveraged deal.
   However, some of the strengthened laws are themselves vulnerable
to attack.
   Bank of New York Co. successfully challenged New York law's
shareholder rights, or ``poison pill'' statute, last year in its
hostile attempt to acquire Irving Trust Co., which it eventually
won.
   The New York legislature has since approved a replacement for
the law.
   Delaware's takeover statute was upheld by a U.S. District Court
in December _ which could make the law even more attractive to
other states. But laws like the Ohio and Pennsylvania statutes that
empower directors to consider non-shareholder interests have not
yet been tested in court.

<HEAD>Silver Hits 26-Month Low On Weak Inflation, Stronger Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver futures prices sank to a 26-month low Friday on New
York's Commodity Exchange as inflation fears eased and investment
demand for precious metals evaporated.
   On other markets, pork bellies rose, grains and soybeans were
mixed and energy futures were mixed.
   Silver settled 12 cents to 18.1 cents lower with the spot
delivery price at $5.53 a troy ounce and the most actively traded
contract, for delivery in July, at $5.61 a troy ounce. Gold was
$3.20 to $3.90 lower with June at $378.90.
   The spot silver price was the lowest since March 20, 1987, when
spot silver settled at $5.52 an ounce.
   Friday's Labor Department report of a moderate 0.4 percent rise
in wholesale prices last month delivered the day's first blow to
the precious metals, which tend to rise and fall with inflation
fears.
   Later in the day, the dollar posted strong gains against other
major currencies, which further weakened investment interest in
precious metals.
   Analysts said recent economic indicators have not clearly
indicated an inflationary trend and the speculation prompted by
reports of sharply rising prices earlier this year has abated.
   To spark strong demand for precious metals, ``you need to have
the consumers and the specultors and the commercials completely
convinced that we are on a strong trend toward inflation,'' said
Jack Barbanel, director of futures trading for Gruntal &amp; Co. in New
York.
   Analysts said that if silver fails to find support at $5.50 an
ounce, it probably will continue to slide, perhaps as low as $5.25
before buying interest surfaces.
   ``We're in a negative trend and we can't shake it off,'' said
Stephen Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Frozen pork belly futures prices leaped for the fourth session
in the last five in a continuing rebound from 9-year lows.
   Seasonal factors are playing a role in the booming belly market,
but chart-watchers say the market was oversold and due for a
correction.
   Hog futures settled mixed while cattle futures mostly were
higher on strong cash markets.
   Live cattle settled .03 cent lower to .43 cent higher with June
at 72.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .77 cent
higher with May at 77.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent
lower to .22 cent higher with June at 48.22 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.18 cents to 1.50 cents higher with May at 36.42
cents a pound.
   Wheat futures ended lower on the Chicago Board of Trade while
the corn and soybean markets finished with higher prices for
old-crop deliveries and losses in the new-crop contracts.
   The drop in wheat prices reflected the arrival of badly needed
rain in the parched winter wheat fields of the southern Plains.
   The USDA lowered to 135 million bushels from 145 million bushels
its projection for the Aug. 31 U.S. soybean stockpile, which
supported prices for beans from last year's crop.
   Strong cash markets boosted the old-crop corn contracts, while
forecasts for favorable planting weather this weekend prompted
selling of new-crop corn and beans.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents to 5{ cents lower with May at $4.22{ a
bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with May at $2.78\
a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 4 cents higher with May at $1.88{ a
bushel; soybeans were 4 cents lower to 6\ cents higher with May at
$7.57} a bushel.
   Energy futures ended narrowly mixed in dull trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 3
cents higher with June at $20.09 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent
lower to .42 cent higher with June at 49.10 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .35 cent lower to .03 cent higher with June
at 67.01 cents a gallon.

   The stock market surged to a new post-crash high
in heavy trading Friday amid renewed investor confidence in the
economy after the government's April wholesale price report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials soared 56.82 points to
end the week at 2,439.70, its highest level since the October 1987
stock market collapse and the biggest daily gain since a
74.68-point rise on May 31, 1988.
   The Dow industrials' previous post-crash high was 2,418.99 at
the close on April 27.
   Broader market indicators also rose sharply. Advancing issues
outnumbered decliners by about 10 to 3 in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,214 up, 360 down and 410
unchanged.
   Analysts said the Labor Department's report that April wholesale
prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent _ compared with some pre-report
estimates of as high as 1 percent _ triggered the rally by raising
speculation that the Federal Reserve was less likely to push
interest rates higher to curb inflation.
   Investors also apparently decided the report meant inflationary
pressures were not building as suggested by last week's
unemployment report. The April jobless report showed more people
were out of work but also that hourly earnings climbed
substantially during the month.
   ``The fear until now was not that the economy would overheat but
that inflation would rise rapidly and keep the Fed from making
moves to ease credit,'' said Michael Metz, technical analyst for
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``Now it looks like that has changed. Inflation
is under control.''
   Prices took off at the opening bell, and many players who had
remained out of the market in anticipation of the wholesale price
report joined the broad-based buying spree.
   But some Wall Street observers cautioned that the market might
have gone too far too fast.
   ``We're still going to have some uncomfortably high numbers,''
said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president of First Albany Corp. ``It
was great today. It lifted everyone's spirits. But investors should
be very careful because the market has overstated the case. So on a
short-term basis we could give some ground.''
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 221.49 million
shares, up from 151.62 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 261.42 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $55.32 billion, or 1.82
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
jumped 3.42 to 175.13.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, IBM rose 1| to 110},
Motorola gained 2\ to 50|, General Electric advanced 2 to 51 and
American Express jumped 2\ to 34.
   Eastman Kodak fell { to 42}, Northwest Airlines dropped } to
102\ and Newmont Mining slid 2] to 39\.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 7.40 to 360.88, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index closed 6.89 higher at 313.84.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
4.20 to 434.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 348.30, up 2.68.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices surged Friday and long-term interest
rates tumbled to three-month lows as a smaller than expected rise
in wholesale prices provided further evidence of an economic
slowdown.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond leaped 25-16 points, or
more than $23 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves
inversely from its price, tumbled to 8.83 percent from 9.06 percent
late Thursday.
   The single-day price increase was the largest since the long
bond gained 2| points last Sept. 2. The yield on the 30-year
government security dipped to its lowest level since early February.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills plunged to 8.47 percent,
their lowest level since Jan. 3.
   The surge in prices followed the Labor Department's report that
wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in April, about half as much as
some analysts had expected.
   ``That tended to allay the market's fear that inflation was
accelerating,'' said William V. Sullivan, director of money market
research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It also suggested for the
first time in well over a year that the Fed may be in a position to
ease credit policy.''
   The indication of an economic slowdown buttressed a government
report Thursday that showed retail sales up 0.4 percent last month,
well under the 1.3 percent many economists had expected.
   Sullivan said an economic slowdown along with lower prices could
lead the Federal Reserve to relax its monetary policy, encouraging
lower interest rates and boosting the value of bonds.
   ``People are thinking we are past the bulge in inflation caused
by oil prices rising,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist with
Nikko Securities International Inc.
   The bond market had declined steadily this week until a small
rise Thursday amid pessimism over a less-than-satisfactory
government quarterly refinancing auction and the belief that the
wholesale prices would rise more.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were up by between { point and 1 point, intermediate
maturities advanced by 15-32 point and 1~ points and long-term
issues were up as much as 27-16 points, according to Telerate Inc.,
the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, climbed 13.83 to 1,145.49.
   The rise in the index was the largest since a gain of 15.00 on
Oct. 22, 1987, three days after the stock market's Black Monday
crash.
   In corporate trading, industrials rose. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose
4.29 to 309.41.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose ~ point to 9227-32. The average yield
to maturity dropped to 7.52 percent from 7.60 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills tumbled to 8.47 percent as
the discount fell 24 basis points to 8.19 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 8.65 percent as the discount dropped 23
basis points to 8.19 percent. Yields on 1-year bills fell to 8.73
percent as the discount fell 26 basis points to 8.09 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 99-16 percent, down from 911-16 late Thursday.

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rose Blumkin, the 95-year-old Russian
immigrant who founded the Nebraska Furniture Mart, said Friday she
has quit the business in a dispute with her grandsons over control
of the store.
   ``I got mad and quit,'' said Mrs. Blumkin, who began selling
furniture out of a basement in 1937 and later became known to the
community as Mrs. B.
   The Furniture Mart is the nation's largest furniture store at a
single location with 300,000 square feet of retail space.
   Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought 90 percent of
the store in 1983 for $55 million, but Mrs. Blumkin retained the
title of board chairwoman and remained a fixture on the sales
floor, selling carpeting and furniture from atop her motorized golf
cart.
   She said she has been angry for some time at her grandsons
Ronald Blumkin, 40, president and chief executive officer of the
Furniture Mart, and Irvin Blumkin, 37, vice president.
   They are sons of Louie Blumkin, 69, who ran the Furniture Mart
along with his mother for years and who still has a major role at
the store.
   Mrs. Blumkin said she is not upset with her son, but told The
Omaha World-Herald she has used the name ``Hitler'' to refer to
grandsons Ronald and Irvin. The Blumkins are Jewish.
   ``Nobody wanted her to leave,'' Louie Blumkin said Friday. ``She
left on her own.''
   ``It's such a marvelous family... and such a generational gap,''
Buffett said in an interview from Washington, D.C.
   ``What she did, I know I'm not capable of doing. She's one of a
kind. She's one of my heroes,'' he said.
   Because of the way the deal was structured, Louie Blumkin's
family has increased its ownership to 20 percent with Berkshire
Hathaway retaining 80 percent.
   Mrs. Blumkin said that in the past she had been respected by her
family and the store's employees, as well as by customers and
suppliers. She fled Russia at the age of 23 and began selling
furniture in the basement of her husband's second-hand clothing
store in 1937.
   Mrs. Blumkin said her work has been her life, putting in 6{ days
per week _ ``60 to 70 hours a week.''
   ``It's awfully lonely, not to do nothing. I need work. I go
nuts,'' she told the newspaper.
   The Furniture Mart's sales of furniture, carpets and appliances
reached $152.5 million last year.

<TEXT>
   Regulators on Friday authorized three
exchanges to sell a new type of security that allows investors to
bet on the direction of the stock market as a whole rather than
purchasing individual stocks.
   Two of the exchanges _ the American Stock Exchange and the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange _ immediately began trading the
instruments, known as stock baskets. Amex is calling its product an
Equity Index Participation and Philadelphia has named its a Cash
Index Participation.
   The instruments are priced to reflect increases and declines in
broad market indexes such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
   In March, the SEC had approved the products, including the
Chicago Board Options Exchange's Value Index Participation, but two
large future exchanges asked the SEC to delay the authorization
while they sought to block trading with lawsuits in a federal
appeals court in Chicago.
   The SEC on Friday denied that request saying the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade had failed to
demonstrate they had a good chance of winning their suits or they
would be irreparably harmed if trading went forward.
   The futures exchanges, which likely would lose business to the
stock baskets, contend that the instruments are a thinly disguised
stock index future and must be approved by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, not the SEC. Stock index futures also allow
investors an opportunity to bet on the overall direction of the
stock market.
   All of the index participation products are based on the current
value of various indexes of stocks. Investors receive quarterly
cash payments equal to a proportionate share of any regular cash
dividend declared on the component stocks of the underlying index.
   In the first day of trading, the Amex recorded sales of 4.3
million participations based on the S&amp;P 500, representing volume of
about $135 million, spokeswoman Marilyn Imwalle said.
   In Philadelphia, volume amounted to $1.7 million in
participations based on the S&amp;P 500 and $12,000 in participations
based on the exchange's Blue Chip Index, which tracks the Dow Jones
industrial average, spokesman Paul Adair said.
   While the American and Philadelphia exchanges began trading
immediately, the Chicago Board Options Exchange is holding off
because of uncertainty created by the lawsuits, CBOE spokesman
Edward Dunn said.
   Late Friday, the futures exchanges asked the Chicago appeals
court to block trading and the court gave the Philadelphia and
American exchanges until Tuesday to reply.

<HEAD>Christian Brothers Winery Rumored Up For Sale; Company Denies It</HEAD>

   Christian Brothers winery is denying
industry rumors that the venerable church-owned Napa Valley
operations might be sold, following a flood of news inquiries.
   Ron Batori, spokesman for the 107-year-old winemaking
institution, said Friday that winery President Richard Maher has
been denying the rumors of a possible sale, but Batori conceded
``there are definitely things going on.''
   ``Our position is that we are going to address (that) issue
sooner rather than later,'' he said.
   Christian Brothers, which is owned by the Catholic church, is
Napa Valley's largest premium vineyard landowner, including some of
most fabled country in the nation's top wine-producing region.
   The rumors are that Christian Brothers might be sold to a
beverage conglomerate such as Heublein, which owns Beaulieu
Vineyard, or Hiram Walker, whose holdings include Clos du Bois.
   Industry sources were skeptical that the church would consider
selling the operation while it was one of its most dynamic periods
ever, engaging in multiple ventures, dramatically improving wines,
and selling products in the United States and 40 other countries.
   The winery, believed the largest church-owned operation of its
kind in the world, has been steadily buying land and is largest
owner or controller of premium vineyard land in Napa Valley with
about 1,250 acres.
   Recent estimates indicating that a top grape-producing Napa
Valley acre is worth $50,000 would make Christian Brothers'
vineyard land alone worth at least $60 million. The company also
has liquid and property assets over a large pasrt of the state.
   The Christian Brothers teaching order was founded in France in
the 17th century. The worldwide order supports schools and colleges
in some 80 countries.
   A few years ago, winery business was slumping from a number of
elements, including a a philosophy against vintage dating. When it
was reconized that this as well as market forces required change,
the brands started swinging up. The catalyst for change was the
loss of brandy market share to Gallo's E&amp;J brand.
   Christian Brothers boasts one of largest lineups of brands in
the U.S. wine industry, including generic burgundy, claret,
chablis, rhine and sauterne, and a full line of premium varietals
including ``Montage,'' a Napa Valley-French blend, plus dessert
wines and champagne.
   The company also makes sacramental wine.

<TEXT>
   The government agency that insures millions of
workers' pensions can't force LTV Corp. to take back several plans
it dumped when it filed for bankruptcy law protection, a federal
appeals court said Friday.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court
ruling that the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. was
``arbitrary and capricious'' in ordering LTV to take back more than
$2 billion in pension fund obligations.
   The appeals court, which sits in Manhattan, agreed with U.S.
District Judge Robert Sweet that the PBGC's grounds for restoring
the pension plans to LTV ``were not supported by the administrative
record'' and the agency's decision should be reversed.
   The appeals court sent the matter back to the PBGC for further
consideration.
   ``The PBGC is studying the opinion,'' said Judith Bekelman, a
spokeswoman for the agency in Washington, who said she could not
comment further until agency lawyers completed their study of the
ruling.
   The PBGC is responsible for insuring pension benefits much like
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. insures bank deposits. The
agency had claimed that LTV taking unfair advantage of federal
funds to cut costs and gain labor peace while it goes through U.S.
Bankruptcy Code Chapter 11 reorganization.
   The PBGC also has claimed it doesn't have enough money to cover
all the other pension plans it has had to take over.
   ``LTV is very pleased with the unanimous decision of the appeals
court,'' said Charles Palmer, an LTV corporate spokesman.
   ``Until we can sort the thing out, I don't think we can say much
more,'' Palmer said, although he added, ``The pension litigation
has been a major obstacle in the forward movement in the Chapter 11
proceeding.''
   Dallas-based LTV, a giant steel, aerospace and energy concern,
filed for protection from its creditors in July 1986 and five
months later, stopped paying for three pension plans in its
Cleveland-based steel-making subsidiary, LTV Steel Co.
   The PBGC took control of the plans for some 100,000 current and
retired employees in January 1987, making the agency LTV's largest
creditor.
   When the PBGC eliminated benefits not covered by its guarantees,
several thousand LTV pensioners had their benefits cut by as much
as $400 a month.
   That prompted the United Steelworkers of America to sue in
bankruptcy court for restoration of the lost benefits and threaten
a crippling strike.
   LTV and the steelworkers union reached a new labor contract in
June 1987 that replaced most of the lost benefits but the PBGC
balked at subsidizing the plans for LTV and last September shifted
responsibility for the pension plans back to LTV.
   LTV sued in bankruptcy court, claiming the PBGC action violated
federal bankruptcy law, which bars legal action against companies
in reorganization.
   The PBGC had the case moved to the district court level before
Sweet, claiming it was concerned that if LTV was able to get out of
its pension plan obligations, that would encourage other companies
with underfunded pension plans to use the bankruptcy code to shed
their obligations.
   But Sweet ruled last September that ``PBGC's conclusion (to
restore the plans to LTV) was reached in an arbitrary and
capricious manner.''
