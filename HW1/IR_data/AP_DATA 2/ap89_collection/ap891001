   A United Airlines jetliner carrying 147 people had to make an
emergency landing Sunday in New Orleans when a hydraulic system
failed, and an Eastern Airlines plane made a unscheduled landing in
Texas after an engine shut down, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported in either incident.
   Emergency crews were waiting on the runway at New Orleans
International Airport when Flight 974, a Boeing 727 en route from
New Orleans to Chicago, touched down at 1:24 p.m. CDT, said United
spokeswoman Deborah Jones in Chicago.
   The system failure had occurred about 25 minutes into the
flight, and the plane turned around and came back, officials said.
   ``As is the case in a situation like this, there was equipment
called out,'' she said. ``It wasn't needed.''
   ``It landed routinely and was towed back to the gate,'' Jones
said. ``Losing the A-system would keep it from being maneuverable
enough to move on its own once it landed.''
   Hydraulic failure was blamed for the crash of a United Airlines
DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa, two months ago, killing 112 people.
   In Amarillo, Texas, the Eastern Airlines L-1011 jet traveling
from Los Angeles to Atlanta with 230 passengers made an unscheduled
landing after the No. 2 engine shut down over Texas, said Richard
McCollum, assistant airport manager.
   Mechanics were looking into a possible fuel-line leak.

   China celebrated the 40th anniversary of
Communist rule Sunday with song, dance and warnings there can be no
deviation from the socialist road.
   Beijing was awash with red flags set against a perfect blue
autumn sky as hundreds of thousands of people on bicycle and
crammed buses streamed to parks for free entertainment.
   Police and the military kept a visible presence as the capital,
under martial law since the student protests this spring, sought to
prevent any attempts by ``counter-revolutionary'' forces to disrupt
the National Day festivities.
   Banners warned of the evils of ``bourgeois liberalization'' or
favoring Western ideas. The Communist Party's official People's
Daily (Renmin Ribao), stressed that history shows ``only socialism
can save China.''
   At the neon-lit Great Hall of the People on Saturday night,
Premier Li Peng hosted a reception for Chinese officials and
foreign diplomats. He used his toast to applaud the ``great
victory'' over pro-democracy protesters.
   ``We should devote major efforts to the strengthening of public
order and firmly crack down on all kinds of criminal activities,''
he said.
   Li also said China faces at least three years of a tight-money
policy to reduce inflation and other serious economic problems, and
noted that payments on its $40 billion foreign debt increase next
year, ``giving rise to new difficulties.''
   ``The leading cadres should ... Work hard, set a good example
and share a life of frugality with the whole people for the next
few years,'' Li said.
   He concluded his 20-minute speech with a toast to the
anniversary and ``the vigorous development of our socialist
modernization.''
   Most foreign ambassadors stationed in Beijing attended the
reception and joined in the toast, but Western ambassadors walked
out before the start of a song-and-dance program that included
several numbers by military troupes.
   The finale featured dancers clad in army uniforms goose-stepping
across the stage in front of a huge red Chinese flag.
   Ambassadors from the United States, Canada, Japan and the
European Community have said they will not attend dances and
fireworks Sunday in Tiananmen Square. One embassy's spokesman cited
``the particular meaning of Tiananmen'' and added: ``We don't feel
it's time yet to become that cozy, to celebrate.''
   The square, adjoining the Great Hall, was the center of the
protests and the students surrendered it only when surrounded by
tanks and troops who shot their way into the capital, killing
hundreds and possibly thousands of people.
   The vast square was aglow Saturday night from strings of lights
on surrounding buildings and trees. A red-and-white neon sign on
top of the Great Hall flashed the dates, ``1949-1989.''
   Red-and-blue neon signs flashed ``Vigorously develop China'' and
``Long Live the Motherland'' on each side of the Tiananmen rostrum,
where revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung proclaimed the founding of
the People's Republic on Oct. 1, 1949.
   Thousands of Chinese normally jam the square and surrounding
blocks on the eve of National Day to enjoy the lights and elaborate
flower arrangements, but this year the square has been open only to
select organized groups, and no one was allowed in Saturday night.
   More than 100,000 people, including soldiers, workers and
students, are to perform folk-style dances in the square on Sunday,
and again only people with special passes, distributed by their
work units, will be allowed in.
   However, even some Chinese with passes have said they are
nervous about going because of vague rumors of a possible bomb
attack by people angry over the June crackdown. Authorities have
warned sternly against any attempts to sabotage the holiday but
have not said if any threats have been made.
   Security also was tighter at Beijing University, whose students
helped lead the spring protests.
   International congratulations were muted due to widespread
condemnation of China's crackdown on the student protesters.
   The only countries to send special delegations were North Korea,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Pakistan, Burundi, Kenya and Cuba.
The Soviet Union sent the vice chairman of the Soviet-Chinese
Friendship Society.
   Former U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, now a private
business consultant, attended Saturday's reception as an honored
guest, walking in with the Chinese leaders.
   ``He's a businessman and that's good business,'' U.S. Ambassador
James Lilley said of Haig's visit. The U.S. government, like most
Western countries, halted high-level exchanges after the June
crackdown.
   One of the highest-ranking officials ousted in the June
crackdown, Hu Qili, made his first public appearance since then at
the Saturday night party. Hu reportedly apologized for his
political errors, unlike ousted party General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang, who still has not reappeared.

   An extremely potent form of heroin that
appeared in the city recently has caused dozens of overdoses and
one death and is overwhelming hospitals, officials said Saturday.
   At least 42 people have overdosed on the Mexican black tar
heroin since Friday morning, and doctors are barely able to handle
all the patients crowding the hallways, said Dr. Ronald Dieckman,
emergency room physician at San Francisco General Hospital, where
38 of the victims were treated.
   The emergency room staff heard about the other victims by
canvassing other hospitals. Ambulance drivers reported additional
uncounted cases, Dieckman said.
   ``It appears to be the influx of a large amount of an extremely
powerful drug dumped into the Bay area. Over the weekend we were
overwhelmed,'' Dieckman said. Typically two or three overdoses
would have occurred in that period, he said.
   All of the patients had stopped breathing and one 33-year-old
man, whose name the hospital did not release, died of an overdose.
Others have sustained brain damage as a result of oxygen
deprivation to the brain, Dieckman said. The staff has been too
busy handling the crisis to complete an accurate count of the
injuries, he said.
   ``Some of these patients are the chronic street users, but we
have also seen a whole number of occasional users who are coming in
and are overdosed on it,'' Dieckman said.

<HEAD>Study Documents Two Cases Of Infection Through Oral Sex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's Health Department says it has
documented the first two cases in which men have become infected
with the AIDS virus through oral sex.
   ``If people have bargained that oral sex is what they're going
to do and stay uninfected, we now have direct evidence that it can
happen,'' Dr. George Rutherford, director of the department's AIDS
office, said Friday.
   The findings came in the study of hundreds of gay and bisexual
men that the Health Department has been conducting since the early
days of the AIDS epidemic.
   City Health Director Dr. David Werdegar acknowledged the
findings were based on interviews with the subjects rather than
clinical evidence but said researchers were ``absolutely sure'' the
two gay men had contracted the human immunodeficincy virus through
oral sex.
   ``We believe we got very accurate information,'' said Werdegar,
who added that the subjects trusted the Health Department
researchers and had worked with them over a long period.
   The research team headed by Rutherford and Dr. Alan Lifson is
preparing to submit the results to either the Journal of the
American Medicl Association or the New England Journal of Medicine,
Werdegar said.
   Both men who tested positive for the HIV virus reported having
performed oral sex on numerous partners, Rutherford said.
   Other clinicians have reported a few other examples of people
becoming infected through oral sex, but the Health Department's
findings were the first time such a transmission had been
documented in a major study, Rutherford said.
   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Kopp warned three years ago
that oral sex might be a transmission path for the AIDS virus, but
some health authorities and parts of the gay community had started
to believe otherwise. The city's gay and lesbian press in recent
months has debated the issue, and some private sex clubs allow the
practice.
   ``There have been a lot of questions about oral sex. (But) this
indicates it definitely is a risk,'' Werdegar said of the findings.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   The scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV.
   As of July 31, the federal Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta had recorded a cumulative total of 102,621 cases of AIDS in
the United States, with 59,391 deaths.

   Cheering and weeping with joy, the
first of more than 4,000 East German refugees who holed up in West
German embassies in Czechoslovakia and Poland arrived in the West
on Sunday.
   East Germany on Saturday agreed to the exodus after a remarkable
accord between Soviet bloc and NATO nations ended a deadlock that
forced many of the refugees to spend weeks camping outside the
embassies.
   The first train carrying about 780 East Germans who had sought
refuge in the West German embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia arrived
in the Bavarian city of Hof at 6:14 a.m. (1:14 a.m EDT). Several
hundred local residents applauded and cheered as the train pulled
into the station.
   The agreement announced Saturday covered nearly 3,500 East
Germans who began crowding into the embassy in Prague several weeks
ago and more than 800 East Germans at the embassy in Warsaw, Poland.
   Early Sunday, Bavarian Radio in West Germany said about half the
3,500 refugees in Prague were en route.
   In Poland 809 refugees boarded an East German train that left
Warsaw's Eastern Station before dawn Sunday, headed for the West
German border city of Helmstedt.
   The accord and its details were announced by officials in West
Germany, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   East Germany, a hard-line Communist nation that had harshly
criticized Warsaw Pact ally Hungary for allowing a similar refugee
exodus earlier this month, said it was granting the transfer as a
``humanitarian act'' and spoke of the refugees being ``expelled.''
   There was no explicit mention of the policy toward future
refugees, but ADN, the official East German news agency, said East
Germany hoped West Germany would follow ``normal, international
customs'' at its embassies abroad after the transfer.
   That appeared to indicate East Germany would oppose continuing
emigration of its citizens to the West. West German officials in
Bonn could not be reached for comment Saturday night.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher made an
unexpected visit to Prague Saturday and delivered the news to
jubilant East Germans at the embassy.
   ``I call you fellow citizens, and express a hearty welcome,''
Genscher, speaking from an embassy balcony, told the weary but
ecstatic masses huddled in the muddy compound.
   He told reporters the solution was agreed on early Saturday in
consultations with the East Germans, Czechoslovaks and Poles.
   Some of the refugees had spent weeks huddled in tents and on
cots in the embassy compound amid growing crowding, spreading
disease and worsening weather.
   The first train left Prague Saturday night. An olive green East
German locomotive left the city's northern rail terminal at 8:50
p.m. local time pulling nine passenger cars.
   About 400 East Germans were on board _ some cheering, others
singing, still others appearing a little dazed by the sudden end to
their ordeal.
   ``We are coming, we are coming,'' a group of young refugees
yelled in unison from an open train window, as Czechoslovak
uniformed police looked on impassively,
   A young woman from Dresden said as she was about to board: ``I
can't believe it, tell me it's not a dream.''
   ADN said trains were to carry the Prague emigres back to East
Germany from Czechoslovakia and on to West Germany. Czechoslovak
state television said the East Germans were to be issued exit
papers while en route to West Germany.
   The route was seen as a face-saving measure permitting East
Germany to say that it had allowed the emigres to go to West
Germany from its territory and not from Czechoslovakia, a Warsaw
Pact ally that had vowed not to allow the transfer.
   In Munich, West Germany, a Bavarian goverment spokesman said by
telephone he believed the trains would leave in intervals of about
two hours, with the first expected in the Bavarian city of Hof
early Sunday.
   The refugees will be housed in emergency quarters maintained by
the Bavarian border police, said a police spokesman. The Bavarian
official and the police spokesmen spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Poland, the East Germans assembled at the West German Embassy
in Warsaw.
   The refugees, some of whom had been allowed to stay in nearby
residential neighborhoods, reacted with cheering and weeping.
   ``I am happy; I am happy'' one young man said through the bars
of the compound gates.
   West German law automatically granting East Germans citizenship
on arrival has contributed to more than 100,000 East Germans
fleeing to West Germany so far this year.
   The East Germans have flooded to West Germany because of
disillusionment with political repression and economic stagnation
in their homeland.
   More than 23,000 East Germans emigrated over Hungary's western
border since Sept. 10, when Hungarian authorities authorized free
passage to Austria of East Germans seeking a new life in the West.
   Hundreds of like-minded East Germans, allowed unhindered travel
into neighboring Czechoslovakia but without the necessary documents
for Hungary, began crowding the West German Embassy in Prague weeks
ago.
   Others crossed illegally from Czechoslovakia into Hungary to
flee West. But hundreds more asked for sanctuary at the embassy in
Prague after Czechoslovak authorities turned them back at the
border or began confiscating visas valid for Hungary in an apparent
effort to stanch the westward flow of East Germans.
   East Germany, Czechoslovakia and other hard-line Warsaw Pact
countries have been critical of reform-minded Hungary for
permitting the exodus.
   In East Berlin, ADN quoted East German Foreign Ministry
spokesman, Wolfgang Meyer, as saying:
   ``In efforts to end the intolerable situation at the West German
embassies in Prague and Warsaw that was not brought about by East
Germany, the East German government ... arranged that these people
illegally at the embassies will be expelled to West Germany across
East German territory with trains of the (West German) railroad.''
   Asked for details on the agreement to let the East Germans
emigrate, a West German government spokesman in Bonn referred to
talks Genscher conducted in recent days outside of a session of the
U.N. General Assembly in New York.
   Genscher had met with his Czechoslovak, East German, Polish,
Soviet, U.S. and French counterparts about the refugee standoffs.

   A second strong earthquake in as many
days struck eastern Burma near the Thai border early Sunday, the
meteorological department said, shaking tall buildings in the Thai
capital hundreds of miles away.
   The quake, measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale, was centered
about 12 miles west of the northern Thai province of Chiang Mai, an
official said on condition of anonymity.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
   Tremors could be felt as far away as Bangkok, about 360 miles to
the south. Tall buildings in the capital shook noticeably.
   Another earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale hit the
same area Saturday, the official said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas.

   Two rockets believed fired by
U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas hit the center of the capital Sunday,
killing at least 13 people and injuring 24, according to hospital
sources.
   The casualty figures were not immediately confirmed by the
Soviet-backed government.
   One rocket fell near the Ministry of Mines and Industry in the
sprawling presidential compound, witnesses said, while the other
hit a park in downtown Kabul near the headquarters of the Sarandoy,
the police force.
   The attack came on Police Day, a 3-year-old holiday honoring the
Sarandoy.
   Most of the wounded were standing near a gasoline station,
waiting for the daily rationing to begin, said the hospital
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Most of the merchants on Chicken Street, the main shopping venue
lined with carpet and antique shops, closed their shutters and went
home.
   Kabul has come under almost daily rocket attack since late June,
with more than 350 people killed and 800 injured.
   The government accuses the guerrillas of firing the rockets at
random to spread panic and force resident to flee to
guerrilla-controlled areas.
   The guerrillas, based in neighboring Pakistan and supported by
the United States and Saudi Arabia, say the Kabul government fires
at its own civilians.

   Special trains from Czechoslovakia and
Poland rumbled through the night, carrying thousands of East German
refugees to West Germany on Sunday.
   Officials said the total number of refugees on their way would
be around 7,000, far more than originally expected. There were
reports the exodus sparked even more East Germans to try to flee
via Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   An agreement between West Germany and Communist East Berlin
cleared the way for the exodus of thousands of East Germans who had
been holed up in Bonn's embassies in Prague and Warsaw, the Polish
capital.
   Hungary's decision last month to open the floodgates to East
German refugees already has brought more than 24,000 people to West
Germany via Austria.
   Three trains arrived from Prague by 10:30 a.m. (5:30 a.m. EDT),
bringing the total from the first three trains to more than 3,000
people. Three more trains were expected during the course of the
day from Prague, carrying about 1,000 people each.
   A train carrying more than 800 East German refugees from Warsaw
was expected to reach West Germany at the Helmstedt border crossing
late Sunday afternoon.
   Earlier reports said the number of refugees expected from Prague
was about 3,500, although officials in Hof said that figure did not
include many of the children accompanying their parents.
   In addition, Bavarian border police spokesman Klaus Papenfuss
said East Germans who had not even been at the embassies in either
city reportedly went directly to the railroad stations to board the
special trains.
   West German officials in Prague said about 100 more East Germans
sought refuge at the embassy after the compound was cleared early
Sunday. Witnesses also said scores of East Germans were rushing to
Czechoslovakia in cars after learning of the decision to allow the
others to leave.
   Police ringed off the West German Embassy in Prague Sunday
morning to thwart any more would-be escapees.

<HEAD>Marcos' Son Says Father's Death Marks End of an Era</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The son of the late Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos vowed his family would some day return from exile,
and that his father would be buried in his homeland.
   Ferdinand ``Bong Bong'' Marcos Jr. defended his father's memory
in a speech Saturday to the United Filipino Council of Hawaii,
saying his autocratic rule was needed to keep peace in his country.
   ``It really is a period of mourning, not a time for politicking
and speeches,'' the 32-year-old son said. ``But this is the end of
an era, and as one chapter closes, another opens, and I find myself
facing the awesome responsibility of trying to fill my father's
shoes.''
   The elder Marcos died Thursday in a Honolulu hospital of heart
failure at age 72.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino, who took Marcos' place when
the strongman fled to Hawaii after a disputed election in 1986, has
refused to allow Marcos' remains to be returned for burial for fear
the return would cause unrest.
   The younger Marcos repeated a promise made earlier by the former
first lady, Imelda Marcos, that the family would continue to work
for the return of his father's remains.
   ``If it takes years, he will be brought home,'' the son said.
   He also promised the Marcos family would return to the
Philippines.
   ``We are not going back to pursue any personal vengeance,''
Marcos said. ``We are going back to try and help get the
Philippines out of the troubles that it has now.''
   Marcos didn't give specifics.
   After the speech, Marcos declined to rule out the possibility of
running for office in the Philippines, but said he didn't forsee it
happening soon.
   During the elder Marcos 20-year rule, the son said, he ``took a
feudalistic, divided nation and made it strong. He built the
economy and gave Filipinos a national identity that they could be
proud of and fight and die for.''

<HEAD>Cow's Blood May Become Substitute for Transfusions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sometime in the next decade, nurses preparing
patients for routine surgery may draw out a few pints of blood and
replace it with something the laws of nature would seem to forbid:
cow's blood.
   Cow's blood _ actually just the oxygen-carrying part of it _ is
one of several substances under development by biotechnology firms
seeking a safe, clean and maybe even superior substitute for what
flows through human veins.
   Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital hope to begin
experiments this fall on healthy human volunteers to see if bovine
blood transfusions are safe. Extensive human testing will be
necessary to overcome skepticism about mixing blood between the
species.
   ``Everybody says you can't give cow's blood to a human, just
like you can't give some people's blood to other people,'' said
Carl Rausch, head of Biopure, a Boston-based company working on
this approach. ``But we are talking about just the oxygen transport
medium, which is hemoglobin.''
   Ordinarily, blood, organs and hormones cannot be swapped between
cats and mice or people and elephants because they are rejected as
foreign substances. But there are exceptions. For instance,
diabetics take cow insulin, and pig valves are used as replacements
in human hearts.
   Biopure has more than people in mind for its product. Tufts
University's veterinary school plans to test the same cow blood
intended for humans to treat sick dogs. Besides opening up a big
market among veterinarians _ it envisions a $60 million a year
business in transfusions for dogs and cats alone _ Biopure hopes
that by showing Bossie's blood works fine for Tabby and Rover,
people will begin to accept the idea that it's good for Aunt
Gertrude, as well.
   ``People are nervous about this because it's bovine-derived,''
said Rausch. ``If you can get a substitute to work in a wide range
of species, then the nay-sayers will have to say, `It might work.'
''
   It should work, he and others believe, because many creatures,
people included, produce similar hemoglobin. In three years of
tests, animals showed no adverse reaction to cow hemoglobin, even
when it replaced 95 percent of their own blood.
   Blood fulfills many vital jobs, transporting nourishment,
hormones and disease-fighting armaments. The substitutes envisioned
by Biopure and others would take the place of just one of these
components _ the red cells.
   Red cells are packed with hemoglobin, a molecule that picks up
oxygen in the lungs and delivers it throughout the body. Putting
back hemoglobin, usually in the form of red cell transfusions, is
often essential for offsetting the blood loss of accident victims
and surgical patients.
   ``There have been attempts to make red cell substitutes for a
quarter of a century,'' said Dr. Harvey G. Klein, chief of
transfusion medicine at the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md.
   Northfield Labs in Northfield, Ill., and Baxter Travenol in
Fairfield, N.J., among others, are developing red cell substitutes
from expired human blood. Green Cross in Japan has made a
fluorocarbon-based synthetic molecule that can carry oxygen, while
Somatagen in Broomfield, Colo., is attempting to make human
hemoglobin through gene splicing.
   ``The great enthusiasm recently is because of the perceived
increased risk of infection being transmitted by transfusions,
primarily AIDS,'' Klein said. ``Red cell substitutes could be
purified to such an extent that viral contamination wouldn't be an
issue. Red cells can't be right now.''
   Despite screening, a tiny risk remains of getting AIDS from a
transfusion. Other viruses can also be passed along _ including
hepatitis and herpes _ as well as a variety of foreign proteins.
   ``Every time you take blood, it's like putting a quarter in the
slot machine,'' said Dr. Charles Huggins, head of Massachusetts
General's blood bank. ``If you are unlucky and come up with three
lemons, you can get hepatitis or something else.''
   Rausch said bovine hemoglobin is purified to be 99.999999999
percent free of viruses. Even if a microbe slips through, it will
be a cow germ, unlikely to cause a human disease.
   Among other advantages, the substitutes could be given to anyone
without matching the blood type. And unlike real blood, which must
be thrown away after about three weeks, the fake varieties would
last six months and perhaps longer.
   Huggins, who will be participating in the human testing of cow
blood, said, ``I am making every effort to put myself out of
business.''
   However, Dr. Leon Hoyer, vice president of research and
development at the American Red Cross, doubts this will happen.
Blood is becoming safer as tests are developed for more viruses, he
said, and doubts will linger about the safety of routinely using
bovine blood and other substitutes.
   ``It's going to take a significant number of clinical trials to
show that they have no toxicity at all. It's one thing to use them
when you have no alternative. It's another to use them electively.
I'm not sure that they will have an advantage over standard blood
that is subject to better testing and viral inactivation procedures
that will get rid of those issues.''
   Even if the substitutes don't replace real red cells, experts
say there are several situations where they might be routinely used:
   _Before such operations as hip replacements, which involve the
loss of large quantities of blood, patients might put several pints
of their own blood in storage and replace it with a hemoglobin
substitute. After the operation, their own blood would be put back.
   _Ambulances might carry blood substitutes so transfusions could
begin immediately for accident victims rather than after they
arrive at the hospital where their blood type can be matched.
   _The military would like to develop a freeze-dried blood
substitute that could be mixed with sterile water on the
battlefield so combat victims could be stabilized until they are
evacuated to hospitals.
   _They could be used to treat victims of heart attacks and
strokes. Because the substitutes are thinner than blood, they might
ooze around clots and carry oxygen to starving tissue, preventing
permanent damage until clots dissolve.
   _They could be used to keep organs alive until they are
transplanted.
   _By boosting oxygen levels, they might improve the killing power
of radiation therapy in treating cancer.
   _Since hemoglobin is a rich source of iron, it might increase
the body's natural production of new red cells, especially when
combined with a growth-stimulating hormone.
   One clear advantage of cow blood is the supply of raw material.
Rausch estimates 70 million cows are slaughtered in the United
States each year, and each contains five to seven gallons of blood.
Most of it goes to waste.
   While plasma is salvaged for fish food, the red cells are a
goopy mass that must be dried and taken to a landfill. Rausch said
he can buy it for 50 cents a gallon. By 1994 _ when, if all goes
well, his product is approved for routine human use _ Rausch
expects to be able to sell the highly purified substitute for $150
to $200 a pint, the price he believes real blood will cost then.

   Police arrested more than 200 people
Sunday while breaking up the latest in a series of anti-nuclear
protests at a U.S.-Australian military base.
   The intelligence-gathering base has been targeted by
demonstrators who consider it a likely target in a superpower
nuclear confrontation.
   Police said 217 of the 500 protesters were arrested inside the
Nurrungar base's outer security zone Sunday, bringing the arrest
total for five straight days of protests to 490. Police said at
least one officer on Sunday used mace, an incapacitating irritant
sprayed in the face, to subdue protesters.
   The media were prohibited from covering the protesters' march
from the second security gate to the main complex, and six
journalists who were arrested during protests Saturday were banned
from the base.
   The federal government called in 50 soldiers Saturday after nine
protesters entered the complex itself Friday night and one climbed
inside one of the white plastic domes near the bases's satellite
antenna. The base is 360 miles northwest of Adelaide, the capital
of South Australia state.

   The Soviet Union announced Sunday that President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev will visit Italy next month.
   The Tass news agency said he would arrive on Nov. 29 and leave
on Dec. 1 but gave no details of his itinerary. A visit to Italy
long has been included in the Soviet leader's plans for this year,
but the date previously had not been announced.
   A Vatican spokesman has said that a Roman Catholic Church
official met in mid-September with the Soviet ambassador in Rome to
discuss a possible meeting between Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II.
   Such a meeting would be the first between a pope and the leader
of the Soviet Union.
   In Poland, meanwhile, state media said Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki will meet with the Polish-born pontiff in Italy this
month, the Polish leader's first trip since becoming the East
bloc's only non-Communist government leader.
   Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity journalist, is closely allied
with the Roman Catholic church and a friend of the pope.
   The prime minister also will meet his Italian counterpart,
Giulio Andreotti, and other key political and business leaders,
state media said.

   An earthquake in southwestern Iran early
Sunday caused heavy destruction and landslides that damaged at
least 300 houses, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties from relief teams
that were rushed to the region, the agency added.
   The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the quake measured
5.1 on the Richter scale and shook the city of Sisakht, about 20
miles northwest of Yasuj, the capital of the Bouyer
Ahmad-Kohgiloyeh province.
   The area is about 200 miles east of Abadan, Iran's major oil
refinery on the Persian Gulf.
   The Iranian news agency quoted the Tehran University Geophysics
Center as saying the quake caused ``massive damage'' and landslides
at four points on the mountain.
   At least 300 houses were damaged and rural roads were blocked in
part of the area by the tremor that was recorded at 6.30 a.m. (11
p.m. EDT), the agency said.
   The Richter scale measures the energy released by an earthquake
by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A magnitude 5 quake
can cause considerable damage.

<HEAD>Psychic Run Over While Trying to Stop a Train</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E. Frenkel, one of the Soviet Union's growing
number of psychic healers and mentalists, claimed he used his
powers to stop bicycles, automobiles and streetcars.
   He thought he was ready for something bigger, so he stepped in
front of a freight train. It didn't work.
   The engineer of the train that ran Frenkel over said the psychic
stepped onto the tracks with his arms raised, his head lowered and
his body tensed.
   The daily Sovietskaya Rossiya on Sunday said investigators
looking into Frenkel's decision to jump in front of a train near
the southern city of Astrakhan found the answer in the briefcase he
left by the side of the track.
   ``First I stopped a bicycle, cars, and a streetcar,'' Frenkel
wrote in notes that the investigators found. ``Now I'm going to
stop a train.''
   Frenkel apparently felt he had found the secret of
psychic-biological power and that his effort to halt a train would
be the ultimate test of his powers, according to the notes. ``Only
in extraordinary conditions of a direct threat to my organism will
all my reserves be called into action,'' he wrote.
   In the last few months, the nation has become awash with
mentalists and self-proclaimed psychics who are appearing on
state-run television, drawing huge crowds, and receiving thousands
of letters requesting help.
   Perhaps the most popular, former television journalist Alan
Chumak of Moscow, appears daily on the morning TV news and variety
program ``120 Minutes.'' He claims his mental energy can help
people over the television, and that even if they are not in front
of the TV, he can energize a glass of water if they leave it there.
   Frenkel also had been proclaimed by local television in
Astrakhan, a city at the mouth of the Volga River 800 miles
southeast of Moscow, as a healer who had managed to help some
people, the report said.
   The engineer of the train saw Frenkel, dressed in a white shirt,
walking along the railroad from a long distance. But only at the
last minute did the mentalist drop his brief case and step onto the
tracks.
   ``Emergency braking didn't help, a tragedy occurred,'' the
newspaper said. It did not say what day Frenkel was killed, or
provide other details.

Body Return</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 people loyal to Ferdinand
Marcos marched through the capital on Sunday and demanded that
President Corazon Aquino allow the late leader's body to be buried
in his homeland.
   Mrs. Aquino said Sunday she will follow any Supreme Court order
to allow the return of Marcos' body, but was confident the justices
would support her ban.
   Marcos died Thursday in Honolulu at age 72. Mrs. Aquino banned
the return of his body on grounds it might cause civil disorder and
asked the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to prevent any
aircraft from violating her order.
   Attorneys for Marcos said they would file a motion Monday asking
the Supreme Court to reconsider its Sept. 15 decision dismissing a
petition to allow Marcos to come home.
   Marcos had lived in exile in Hawaii since he was ousted in a
popular uprising three years ago that propelled Mrs. Aquino to
power.
   In an 8-7 vote, the court agreed with Mrs. Aquino that the
former president's return ``poses a serious threat to national
interest.''
   Marcos' lawyers hope the justices will reconsider now that the
former president is dead and since the vote on the first
consideration was so close.
   ``I will certainly respect the decision of the Supreme Court,''
Mrs. Aquino said in her weekly nationwide radio program Sunday.
``And I believe they can arrive at the best decision possible.''
   Mrs. Aquino said she believed she could explain to the justices
``what I really want to achieve'' for the welfare of the country.
She said the ban would be continually reviewed but ``at this time
there is really nothing so far to make me change my original
decision, which is not to allow the return of President Marcos'
body.''
   In a statement Sunday, opposition groups said they would
``exhaust all peaceful and legal means'' to bring his body home.
   The statement by the New Society Movement and the Nacionalista
Party of Vice President Salvador Laurel claimed public opinion
favored the burial of the former president ``in the land of his
birth.''
   Following a meeting at the presidential palace Saturday, Sen.
Neptali Gonzales said Mrs. Aquino ordered the ban after receiving
unspecified intelligence information ``of a national security
nature.'' Gonzales refused to elaborate.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, is barred from leaving the United States
because she has been indicted on racketeering charges in the
alleged embezzlement of Philippine government money. She is to go
on trial in New York in March.
   Despite government fears of unrest, the few pro-Marcos rallies
held since his death have been peaceful.
   In Sunday's march, about 1,000 loyalists carried banners in a
downtown park urging Mrs. Aquino to reconsider the ban. They later
marched to Camp Crame, headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary,
where they held a vigil.
   Prayer vigils were held at the Marcos family home in suburban
San Juan and at the home where he grew up in Batac in Ilocos Norte
province, 250 miles north of Manila.
   Batac Mayor Jesus Nalupta said Marcos supporters had decided on
peaceful protests so as not to give the government another excuse
for banning the burial.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 14-24 with 1,071 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:

<HEAD>Poll: One-Third of Americans Know a Cocaine User</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly one-third of American adults know someone
who uses cocaine, but most say drug abuse is not a serious problem
in their own neighborhoods, a poll has found.
   While President Bush pursues a multibillion-dollar war on
illegal drugs, saying they are ``sapping our strength as a
nation,'' just 14 percent in the survey called the problem ``very
serious'' where they live.
   Still, 61 percent in the Media General-Associated Press poll
identified drug abuse as the nation's greatest problem overall, a
level that has risen steadily in opinion polls as the issue drew
increasing political and media attention.
   Among that majority, barely more than a third expected the
problem to lessen in the next decade. And respondents split sharply
on whether the best line of attack is against drug producers,
dealers or users.
   Majorities came together, though, in opposing some priorities of
Bush's program. While most of its funds are for law enforcement,
for example, 60 percent said treating drug users will accomplish
more than punishing them.
   Moreover, a 57 percent majority said building more federal
prison cells for drug offenders _ as Bush has proposed _ will fail
to reduce drug abuse. Drug treatment and education were seen by far
more people as effective.
   Despite those differences, nearly three-quarters of the 1,071
respondents were convinced that the Bush administration is making a
serious effort. And two-thirds said the federal government can
reduce drug abuse significantly.
   Respondents were split on whether Bush's $7.9 billion plan
spends enough money, too little or too much. About half wanted
anti-drug money taken from other programs, while a third favored
raising taxes. The rest were unsure.
   Though taxes were not popular generally, three-quarters
supported raising cigarette or alcoholic beverage taxes to pay for
a bigger drug program, and seven in 10 supported a 1 percent
increase in corporate income taxes.
   Another funding scheme had less support: By 53-43 percent,
respondents opposed a 1 percent increase in personal income taxes.
   The poll, conducted Sept. 14-24, had a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse has estimated that roughly
8 million Americans have used cocaine in the past year and 1
million of them use it at least once a week. In the survey, 31
percent said they know someone who uses cocaine or its derivative,
crack. About half of them, or about one-seventh of all respondents,
said they know an addict.
   Younger people were far more likely to know a cocaine user; 48
percent of those age 18-29 said they did. Black respondents and
big-city residents also were more likely to know a cocaine user.
   In a speech Sept. 5 announcing his drug war, Bush called on
Americans who know drug abusers to help them stop. But the poll
showed the difficulty of that approach: Of those who knew current
cocaine users, nearly six in 10 said they already have tried to get
them off drugs.
   Big-city dwellers were the most concerned about drugs in their
neighborhoods, with half saying illegal drugs posed a ``very'' or
``somewhat'' serious problem where they live, as opposed to ``not
too'' or ``not at all'' serious.
   In the nation as a whole, four in 10 rated drugs a serious local
problem and nearly six in 10 did not.
   The poll found overwhelming objection to illegal drug use in a
variety of scenarios, including buying and selling marijuana or
cocaine. Least offensive was growing marijuana for personal use at
home: Twenty-six percent found that unobjectionable.
   Respondents favored some new punishments for occasional drug
users, with 82 percent saying people caught with drugs in their
cars should have their licenses suspended, and 63 percent saying
the cars should be confiscated.
   People were split about evenly, however, on the notion of
sending occasional drug users to military-style boot camps.
   When pupils are caught with drugs at school, 99 percent said
their parents should be told and 78 percent said the police should
be told. Six in 10 said the pupil should be suspended, while most
opposed expulsion.
   To stop the flow of drugs into this country, eight in 10
respondents said Bush should order the military to patrol the
borders for smugglers. But a minority of 43 percent said he should
order military strikes against illegal drug operations in foreign
countries.

<HEAD>Will Conservative Veer Continue in New Term?</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, a
conservative Supreme Court majority solidified last spring to veer
the court dramatically to the right. The question now is whether
Rehnquist can keep the momentum rolling into the 1990s.
   The 1989-90 term, beginning Monday, will offer the beginning of
an answer by July. Although the court's decision docket is not yet
as packed with ideologically divisive issues as it was last term,
that could change as the justices begin taking on new cases.
   ``The opportunities, through the cases, will always present
themselves,'' University of Michigan law professor Yale Kamisar
says with a dread shared by many liberals. ``The chief justice
should have no problem keeping the court busy taking the life out
of (liberal) precedents.''
   The Rehnquist court came of age last term by cutting back
abortion rights, curtailing affirmative action for women and
minorities, limiting civil rights protections, condoning mandatory
drug testing and permitting capital punishment for juveniles and
retarded people convicted of murder.
   Conservatives who two years ago were highly critical of
Rehnquist's leadership now have high praise.
   Rehnquist did not change, but the court's cast did. Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy has provided a conservative vote far more
dependably than did his predecessor, Lewis F. Powell.
   Justices Antonin Scalia, Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor
joined with Rehnquist and Kennedy in numerous key cases last term
to relegate Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry
A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens to the role of dissenters.
   That 5-4 majority, however, is not rock solid.
   For example, the judicial philosophy of Rehnquist and O'Connor _
driven largely by an inclination to defer to Congress and state
legislatures _ at times has been at odds with Scalia's
take-no-prisoners, libertarian brand of conservatism.
   ``Rehnquist is doing a pretty good job, but he might not have a
dependable, operative conservative majority in place for a few more
terms,'' says Patrick McGuigan of the conservative Free Congress
Foundation.
   Conservatives are buoyed by the comparative youthfulness of the
court's new majority. Rehnquist turned 65 on Sunday, White is 72,
and Scalia, O'Connor and Kennedy are in their 50s.
   Brennan, the court's leading liberal, is also its oldest
justice. He's 83. Marshall and Blackmun are 81, and Stevens is 69.
   ``We have to face the fact that sooner or later Justice Brennan
is not going to be there, fighting the brilliant rear-guard action
he has fought for so long,'' says Kamisar. ``If anything, the
conservative movement could accelerate.''
   In the new term, the early best bets for conservative victories
appear to be states gaining even more power to limit access to
abortions and a curtailment of the federal judiciary's power in
civil rights enforcement.
   The justices have under study attempts by three states _ Ohio,
Minnesota and Illinois _ to regulate abortions more stringently
than allowed explicitly in the court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
that legalized abortion and subsequent rulings.
   The court also is to decide whether federal judges exceeded
their authority when ordering a Kansas City school district to
increase property taxes to help pay for racial desegregation and
when fining four Yonkers, N.Y., city council members for failing to
carry out a previously agreed-to housing desegregation plan.
   ``In a very distinct sense, these are solemn and indeed somber
times for those interested in pressing and advancing basic civil
rights,'' Blackmun told a Chicago lawyers' group last month.
   The justice said the Rehnquist court's five-member majority
``apparently will vote as a group in cases of this kind, and may
well have control of the court in the long years ahead.''

<TEXT>
   China celebrated its 40th anniversary Sunday with
a spectacular fireworks show above Tiananmen Square and tight
security to prevent protests reminiscent of the crushed
pro-democracy movement.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 85, headed the dignitaries who
watched the show, which included several hundred thousand dancers,
from the rostrum of Tiananmen Gate.
   It was on that rostrum on Oct. 1, 1949, that Mao Tse-tung
declared the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
world's most populous Communist state.
   The square, occupied by thousands of students and their
supporters during the seven-week pro-democracy movement the
military crushed in June, was again filled with youths, but this
time they were party followers.
   A 26-foot-tall statue depicting a worker, peasant, intellectual
and soldier was displayed at the north end of the square on the
same spot where the student protesters erected their ``Goddess of
Democracy,'' a torch-bearing woman based on the Statue of Liberty.
   The square was bathed in spotlights, neon signs that said
``1949-1989'' and ``Long Live the Motherland,'' and a fireworks
show that lasted more than three hours.
   There also were dance shows and fireworks at eight other
locations in Beijing.
   But the narrow streets around Tiananmen were deserted as police
and soldiers set up roadblocks to keep out all except local
residents and those with passes to the square.
   It has been under military guard since soldiers backed by tanks
marched on Beijing June 3-4 and drove the students from the square.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died in the violence.
   Thousands of police and soldiers patrolled the city Sunday in
jeeps, on bicycle and on foot. Some were in riot gear and many were
armed with automatic rifle and electric prods.
   Joining Deng on the rostrum in Tiananmen were Communist Party
General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and 84-year-old Chen
Yun, an ideological conservative who is rarely seen in public
because of his frail health but who is believed to retain influence
over major party decisions.
   China invited few foreign dignitaries to the 40th anniversary
celebrations. The ambassadors of all the Western countries and
Japan boycotted the Tiananmen gala to demonstrate their continued
disapproval of China's suppression of dissent.
   The top foreign leaders on the rostrum were Cambodian resistance
leader Prince Sihanouk, East German Politburo member Egon Krenz and
representatives from countries including the Soviet Union,
Pakistan, Cuba, Burundi, Comoros, North Korea, Kenya and
Czechoslovakia.
   One American known to be on the rostrum was former secretary of
state Alexander Haig, in Beijing as a private citizen attending a
business symposium. As part of the opening ceremonies, the
announcer said: ``Celebrate the 40 years of Communist China,
celebrate the quelling of the turmoil and the counterrevolutionary
rebellion.''
   The government says the pro-democracy movement was aimed at
overthrowing the socialist system and the Communist Party.
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted Deng as saying the
movement was ``bad, but in the final analysis it is beneficial to
us because it made us more sober-minded.''
   When Deng took power in the late 1970s he set the nation on a
course of economic reforms based on market principles.
   But the aging revolutionary remains deeply conservative on
social and political issues, and he has cracked down every time
political dissent has threatened to get out of hand.

   One of the first cases to be argued before the
Supreme Court in the new term centers on whether a federal judge
acted within his authority by fining and threatening to jail four
city councilmen who defied his desegregation order.
   The Yonkers, N.Y., councilmen maintain that the judge tried to
intimidate them into voting for a plan they opposed, thereby
violating their legislative immunity or the right to vote as they
choose without fear of punishment by the courts.
   The federal government maintains the councilmen were in contempt
of a court order, and that legislative immunity is not a license to
disobey the law.
   The case, to be argued Monday, is an outgrowth of an
acrimonious, nine-year battle in which the federal government has
been trying to induce Yonkers _ the state's fourth-largest city,
just north of New York City _ to build low-income housing in white
neighborhoods. The housing has not yet been built as city leaders
argue over sites and money.
   The original case was filed by the Justice Department in 1980.
Five years later, U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand found Yonkers
had for 40 years deliberately concentrated virtually all its
subsidized housing in the southwest quadrant to keep blacks
separate from whites. Sand ordered the city to build 200 units of
public housing in white neighborhoods in 1988 and to plan for 600
more.
   But the city defaulted and unsuccessfully appealed. Sand then
ordered Yonkers to adopt a package of financial incentives designed
to attract the low- and moderate-income housing or face fines
starting at $100 a day and doubling each day until they reached $1
million daily.
   In August 1988, the council voted 4-3 against the package. The
four dissident councilmen _ Nicholas V. Longo, Edward J. Fagan Jr.,
Peter Chema and Vice Mayor Henry Spallone _ were held in contempt,
fined $500 a day and threatened with jail for refusing to vote for
desegregation plan.
   Facing bankruptcy, Yonkers prepared to lay off hundreds of
employees and asked the Supreme Court to overturn the fines. The
court refused, and Yonkers paid $819,000 before Chema and Longo
switched their votes and the plan passed, 5-2.
   Each councilman paid $3,500 in fines. Spallone and Fagan
remained defiant, but their punishment has been stayed pending
appeal.
   In asking the Supreme Court to hear Spallone's case, his lawyers
argued the lower courts had ``done violence'' to the doctrine of
legislative immunity.
   ``Whether one agrees or disagrees with any legislator's apparent
political agenda, tactics or motive, the doctrine must remain
inviolate,'' they wrote. ``Inquiry into motives for legislative
action is precisely one of the evils which the doctrine seeks to
prevent.''
   But the United States, in its brief, argued that the city
government had already agreed to the desegregation order when the
councilmen voted against the plan.
   ``The (Supreme) Court has never considered the common law
doctrine of legislative immunity as a license to disobey federal
court orders,'' the government argued.

<HEAD>Tenor Richard Leech Makes Met Debut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Metropolitan Opera's first performance of
``La Boheme'' this season had just one thing going for it, but that
turned out to be a lot.
   Richard Leech, a young American tenor of outstanding promise,
made his debut Saturday afternoon in the role of Rodolfo, the
Bohemian writer whose love affair with the fatally ill Mimi forms
the slender plot of Puccini's masterpiece.
   Leech justified the excitement he has stirred in Chicago, Berlin
and other operatic centers. Though only 32, he used his warm,
medium-size voice with the ease and grace of a veteran, and he came
closer to looking the part than most tenors the Met engages. The
audience gave him a standing ovation at the final curtain.
   The rest of the performance wasn't much to cheer about.
   As Mimi, the Korean-born soprano Hei-Kyung Hong was a bit out of
her league, her lovely but small voice unable to bloom and soar
over the orchestra at climactic moments. Soprano Sona Ghazarian's
rough tones failed to captivate during her big moment, Musetta's
Waltz Song. Baritone Brian Schexnayder was a stalwart but
small-scale Marcello, the hero's best friend.
   Conductor Donato Renzetti, also making his Met debut, gave an
account of the score that was more plodding than impassioned. One
of Puccini's most ingenious touches is the way he swiftly brings
the curtain down after Mimi dies; on Saturday, the final measures
seemed to last forever.
   As much a problem as ever were the gargantuan sets by Franco
Zeffirelli, which often make it hard for the singers to be heard or
noticed. What should be a warm, intimate attic setting for the
first and fourth acts is turned into a Parisian skyline, with the
garret pushed back behind rooftops and chimneys. The split-level
set for the second-act cafe scene is so elaborate and has so many
people milling about that it's hard to concentrate on the action.
   Zeffirelli has created similarly bloated spectacles in recent
seasons for two other Puccini operas. In ``Turandot,'' the glitz
seemed to fit the grandiose music and action; but in ``Tosca,'' the
love story was again pushed aside to make room for stage gimmickry.
   Two of this season's five new productions _ Verdi's ``La
Traviata'' and Mozart's ``Don Giovanni'' _ have been put in his
hands, apparently on the theory that Zeffirelli sets will bring in
an audience even if the singing and conducting won't.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 74 years under South African
rule, Namibians are engaged in an electoral free-for-all for the
right to lead the territory into independence.
   In voting set for Nov. 7-11, Namibia has the opportunity to
transform itself from Africa's last colony into one of the
continent's most politically diverse and democratic nations.
   The campaign has been marked by violence and intimidation, but
it also is a rarity in Africa: a multiparty competition where the
outcome is in doubt. There are 10 parties that include leftists,
rightists, all-white parties, all-black parties and multiracial
parties.
   ``I think all sides are optimistic that we are going to have
fair elections as planned,'' said Fred Eckhard, an American who is
chief spokesman for the U.N. contingent monitoring Namibia's
independence process.
   The front-runner is the South-West Africa People's Organization,
the black-dominated independence movement that waged a 23-year war
against South African rule.
   Namibians will vote for a 72-member constituent assembly, with
members chosen in proportion to the number of votes their party
receives. If SWAPO wins at least two-thirds of the vote, it can
write and implement a constitution by itself.
   However, details about SWAPO's imprisonment and torture of
hundreds of its own members in neighboring Angola have damaged its
reputation at home and abroad. Former detainees say hundreds are
still being held or have been killed, a charge the organization
denies.
   In the absence of reliable election surveys in the vast,
sparsely populated territory, it is unclear whether the
leftist-leaning organization will capture two-thirds of the vote,
or even a simple majority.
   SWAPO's popularity was evident Sept. 24 when its president, Sam
Nujoma, attended his first rally after returning from 30 years in
exile; 70,000 people showed up at a sports stadium in Windhoek, a
city of about 100,000.
   No other party can draw such massive crowds, but several
regularly attract audiences in the thousands for peaceful,
well-organized rallies.
   Singing and slogan chanting are more common at such events than
talk about how to balance the budget or run a civil service.
   There are repeated charges of intimidation, however, mostly
between SWAPO and its leading rival, the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, a moderate, multiracial coalition that favors a
capitalist economy.
   ``In the past, most cases of intimidation were attributed to the
police,'' said John Rwambuya, head of the U.N. operation in the
northern town of Oshakati. ``But as the campaign begins to heat up
there is interparty conflict and confrontation.''
   Eckhard says the United Nations receives five to 10 complaints
daily about harassment. SWAPO says its leaders, including Nujoma,
have received anonymous death threats over the telephone, as well
as in posters and graffiti that have appeared around Windhoek, the
capital.
   Anton Lubowski, the only ranking white member of SWAPO, was
assassinated outside his Windhoek home Sept. 12, two days before
Nujoma returned.
   The vice president of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, Mishake
Muyongo, says SWAPO backers have beaten alliance supporters and
stoned their cars.
   In Katutura, the main black neighborhood on the edge of
Windhoek, the offices of all political parties are surrounded by
fences with barbed wire on top.
   All of the parties have agreed that their members will not carry
weapons.
   Ironically, the only armed protection available to SWAPO is the
Namibian police, who were heavily involved in the war against the
guerrilla movement. SWAPO says it has reluctantly requested police
protection for its leaders.
   Despite such problems, the campaign has proceeded relatively
smoothly, a feat considering that the bush war raged in the
northern part of the territory as recently as April.
   Almost 700,000 of Namibia's estimated 1.3 million people
registered to vote, a figure that exceeded the expectations of
electoral officials.
   ``I admit I'm a bit surprised,'' Muyongo said. ``I thought the
tension would be higher. It's clear the Namibian people want peace
and they can't wait any longer.''
   But it remains to be seen whether Namibia can maintain a
democratic tradition after independence.
   Several African nations reached independence as multiparty
states, but only a handful of the continent's 50 governments
currently tolerate opposition parties and hold open elections.
   Nujoma said Sept. 24 that his organization ``has no intention of
imposing a one-party political system on the Namibian people
against their will,'' and he invited the territory's 75,000 whites
to join in building a new nation.
   South Africa agreed to grant independence to Namibia last year
under a regional treaty that also calls for the withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban soldiers from Marxist-ruled Angola.

<HEAD>Japan's Governing Party Wins Its First Election Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A governing party candidate won a seat in
Parliament's upper chamber Sunday in the party's first electoral
test since the opposition won control of the house in general
elections in July.
   Sunday's election also was the first for the administration of
new Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and was regarded as an indication
of public sentiment as Japan prepares for elections for the more
powerful lower house.
   Itsuo Nomura, an attorney and local assembly member from the
governing Liberal Democratic Party, received 467,643 votes, or 51
percent.
   Socialist candidate Shizue Hosogane had 394,123 votes, or 43
percent. Communist candidate Setsuo Yamada received 52,642, or 5.7
percent.
   The election was to fill the vacancy left by the death in August
of Liberal Democratic Party legislator Niro Iwakami.
   ``No words can express my feelings now,'' Nomura said in a
televised interview as he celebrated his victory in Ibaraki, 65
miles northeast of Tokyo. ``I feel a great responsibility.''
   The Socialists had campaigned primarily on a platform of
abolishing an unpopular sales tax the Liberal Democrats pushed
through late last year.
   The 3 percent tax, part of a sweeping change that included
income tax cuts, is widely opposed by merchants and lower- and
middle-income consumers.
   A bill to abolish it was submitted in the opposition-dominated
upper house last week. The Liberal Democrats now are working out a
compromise tax revision in an effort to deflect criticism.
   ``This is a victory for the new Kaifu Cabinet and shows the
people's faith and understanding of our plans for tax revision,''
Chief Cabinet Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, the main government
spokesman, said at a news conference.
   Ms. Hosogane, the Socialist candidate, told reporters: ``The
(Liberal Democrats) stressed it would `revise' the tax and the
people seemed to accept that, even though the government has not
made clear in any way how it will go about it.''
   Socialist Party Secretary General Tsuruo Yamaguchi said on
television the election ``was a question of either abolishing the
tax or maintaining it. We weren't able to get that message across
adequately to the people of Ibaraki.''
   The Socialists also had hoped that Ms. Hosogane, a schoolteacher
and a political novice, would attract voters who are tired of
veteran politicians and who want to see Parliament invigorated by
fresh faces.
   Rocked by money and sex scandals and outrage over the tax, the
Liberal Democrats lost their majority in the upper house in July
for the first time since the party was formed in 1955.
   The party retains its majority in the lower house and has been
trying to restore its popularity before the next lower house
elections, possibly in January. The elections must be held before
July 1990.

<HEAD>Burmese Army Chief Says he Sympathizes with Chinese Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army chief said he sympathizes with
China and the troubles it faced when it crushed the pro-democracy
movement in June, the state newspaper reported Sunday.
   Burma faced a similar movement last year and crushed it in
September 1988 when troops killed thousands of protesters.
   The Working People's Daily said Brig. Gen. Khin Nyunt, who heads
the country's military intelligence, made the comments Friday at
the contruction site of a Chinese-built theater in Rangoon.
   ``I thank the Chinese government for sending engineers to
complete the construction in time while the country (China) is
suffering from the consequences of the disturbances,'' Khin Nyunt
said.
   Construction of the 1,500-seat theater, a gift from then-Chinese
President Li Xiannian in 1985 _ was suspended during Burma's
massive pro-democracy protests.
   Millions took to the streets in the student-led uprising against
years of authoritarian repression. It ended following a series of
crackdowns in which thousands were shot to death.
   Diplomats and dissidents say that several thousand pro-democracy
supporters have been arrested since July, when the two leading
opposition politicians, Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, were placed
under house arrest.
   The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon has said it has ``credible'' reports
that many of those arrested have been tortured, some to death. The
government denies the charge.
   China celebrated its 40th anniversary Sunday. On June 3-4,
troops marched on Beijing and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
people were killed when the military crushed the student-led
protests for democracy.

<TEXT>
   A Senate panel is delaying confirmation of
President Bush's nominee to head the Urban Mass Transportation
Administration while it investigates work done by his auditing firm.
   The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee is
examining the relationship between nominee Brian Clymer's suburban
Philadelphia accounting firm and an economic development
organization nearby, according to Senate aides.
   The organization, the Delaware County Partnership for Economic
Development, is the subject of a broad audit by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, HUD Inspector General Paul Adams
said in an interview Friday.
   The Senate panel unanimously backed Clymer's nomination on Sept.
8, but has since put a ``hold'' on sending it for a vote for the
full House.
   The local partnership, which has received thousands of dollars
in HUD grants, was founded in 1983 by U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa.,
who has said he is not involved in its daily affairs. The
congressman ordered a consultant to investigate the partnership
earlier this year when it was disclosed that several of Weldon's
campaign supporters had received no-bid contracts.
   Of particular interest to the Senate panel are no-bid contracts
reportedly awarded to Clymer's firm by the partnership to audit its
books.
   Clymer has been Weldon's campaign treasurer in the last three
elections.
   Anthony J. Dunleavy, the consultant retained at Weldon's
request, said that this year's contract given Clymer's firm was
properly bid. However, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that
Dunleavy said that previous year's contracts with Clymer's firm
were not awarded through competitive procurement policies required
by the federal government. The newspaper said federal money was
used.
   Dunleavy also said the partnership misspent $125,000 in federal
funds on ineligible items such as a promotion film and advertising.
William Tancredi, a top official of the partnership, resigned in
July after coming under fire for his handling of the organization's
finances.
   Adams, the inspector general, said HUD was conducting a general
audit of the partnership that was ``not limited in any way, shape
or form.''
   HUD was doing another audit in Delaware County when ``a
combination of things occurred concurrently'' that convinced it of
the need to look into the partnership, Adams said. He declined to
be more specific.
   Clymer, 42, is the former vice chairman of the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. UMTA assists state and local
governments in improving mass transportation systems. He has
declined requests to be interviewed about the matter.

   Prostitutes continue working Harry Hines Boulevard
in an industrial section of Dallas even as the city prepares to
defend before the U.S. Supreme Court its efforts to slow down or
least regulate the sex trade.
   The high court will hear arguments Wednesday on whether the city
can enforce portions of an ordinance that is aimed at adult
bookstores, clubs and motels.
   There ordinance, which took effect in June, seeks to regulate
the sex trade chiefly through zoning and a licensing requirement
for business operators, as well as lesser provisions such as a
requirement that motel rooms be rented for at least a 10-hour
period.
   The Supreme Court has upheld the city's zoning regulations, and
will debate only the licensing requirement, which calls for
background checks on the owners of sexually oriented businesses.
Owners convicted of certain crimes, including two violations of the
state's obscenity laws, can be refused a license or lose a license
already granted.
   The appeal filed by 14 businesses argue that constitutes prior
restraint.
   They are also challenging a provision giving the police chief
sole discretion in issuing licenses, saying that power is too broad.
   The police chief, in effect, ``becomes a master censor for the
community,'' without any guidance in the ordinance itself, said
Arthur Schwartz, attorney for the owners.
   The businesses say the licensing requirements violate their free
speech rights. ``It's tantamount to destroying the presses of a
newspaper for straying over the line in libel cases,'' said
Schwartz.
   The zoning sections forbid sexually oriented businesses from
operating within 1,000 feet of each other, or within 1,000 feet of
a church, park, school, residential area or historic district.
   The city is planning to ask a state court for orders to shut
down 60 businesses which do not meet the code, vice detective Steve
Foster said.
   Businesses can get an exemption if they prove that their
businesses do not contribute to crime or damage property values.
   So far, eight of 35 exemption requests have been granted. Those
who did not win exemptions had to shut down, move, or change their
operations to fall outside of the ordinance.
   One prostitute who works the street during the day says she can
make between $500 and $1,000 a day, but rarely works in the motels
that dot the strip anymore because they have begun enforcing the
part of the ordinance that requires motel rooms to be rented for 10
hours or longer.
   ``The motels make you pay for all night,'' she said.
   Some adult bars skirt the zoning provisions by changing their
dancers' costumes. This was the case with Geno's Southern Belles,
which was denied an exemption because the topless bar was less than
1,000 feet from an apartment complex.
   Manager Marty Akeman said the club's dancers donned pasties and
bikini bottoms, which took the club out of the legal definition of
a sexually oriented business and brought it under codes governing
dance halls and live entertainment.
   Pasties and bikini bottoms are also the norm at the Bare Facts,
a lounge a few block south of Geno's. Bartender Dorothy Burrus
belittles the regulations, saying, ``You can see more on the
beach.''
   One Bare Facts customer, who identified himself only as Larry,
bristled at the law's ability to close down existing businesses.
   ``It's like people who move near an airport and then complain
about the noise,'' he said.
   But he acknowledged: ``I wouldn't want this in my neighborhood.''
   John Taylor has watched the action from his Star Tire store for
4{ years. It's not as bad now as it was, he says, but he thinks
increased police enforcement _ not the ordinance _ is responsible.
   ``They (prostitutes) used to be so thick out there that I'd have
to stop and wait to get into my parking lot,'' he said. ``Now, it's
not so bad. You'll have two or three.''

<HEAD>Some Restrictions on ``Choice'' May Be Needed, Says Education Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos
praised parental choice Sunday as the ``cornerstone'' to rebuilding
America's schools, but said some restrictions on student transfers
may be necessary to prevent segregation.
   Cavazos, in an interview on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' also defended his 13-month tenure and said that he has
been pushing all along the same school reform ideas that President
Bush and the governors agreed upon at last week's summit in
Charlottesville, Va.
   The summit ended Thursday with unanimous support for efforts to
give parents more say in choosing which public school their child
attends, instead of assigning them strictly by neighborhood lines.
   ``Parental choice of schools is vital. It's the cornerstone for
restructuring American education,'' said Cavazos.
   Asked about the possibility of choice leading to segregation,
Cavazos said: ``You have to be very conscious about that and be
careful about that.
   ``You have to put into place then guidelines that will prohibit
students from transferring if that were to occur,'' added Cavazos,
who said Minnesota and Arkansas have not have such problems with
their statewide choice plans.
   Cavazos, asked about a Newsweek report that Bush was
dissatisfied with his performance, said the president has not
discussed that with him.
   ``Many of the things we're talking about now _ restructuring,
choice, setting national goals _ all of those things are things
that we've been advocating for over a year, but somehow people just
haven't been listening and paying attention,'' said the former
Texas Tech University president, who became the first Hispanic
Cabinet official ever when appointed by then-President Reagan last
year.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, also interviewed on ABC, predicted
the national performance goals Bush and the governors agreed to
forge will include reducing the dropout rate from 25 percent to 10
percent, and moving from the bottom on international math and
science tests ``to the top two or three countries'' over 10 years.
   Clinton said that while more money is needed to help get poor
children physically and mentally fit to begin school, the main
challenge is to restructure American schools and reallocate
existing resources.
   ``There's not a lot more money from the federal government we
need if it's sharply, clearly focused,'' Clinton said.
   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean said: ``There's also a problem about
what happens to the children after they get into the school. There
are a tremendous number of schools who warehouse children simply
instead of teaching them, who practice what I call educational
child abuse in the cities.''
   Kean said drug czar William Bennett was ``simply wrong'' in
characterizing some discussions at the education summit as ``pap.''
   ``We started with a small group of governors who were concerned
with education seven or eight years ago. We now have 50 education
governors committed to it. We have a president of the United States
who's willing to take the lead and say this is our most important
subject facing the country,'' said Kean.
   Clinton said Bennett has ``had a lot of good ideas over the
years, and he had a bad day that day. I wish he'd never said it. It
was a great conference. We set national performance goals for the
first time in the history of the country and the schools are going
to be better.''

   Kathy Troughton didn't hit bottom
until she saw a National Guardsman holding a rifle at her
neighborhood grocery store five days after Hurricane Hugo hit.
   Then she began to cry.
   ``That meant that we were really in trouble,'' she said.
   Restricted to cold showers and limited lighting for more than a
week until they got their power back Saturday night, the family of
Ben and Kathy Troughton is like thousands of families coming to
terms with the destruction Hurricane Hugo brought when it raged
ashore with 135 mph winds Sept. 21.
   The Troughtons are better off than many. While an estimated
50,000 residents in the Charleston area are still listed as
displaced persons, the Troughtons have stayed in their home, a
wood-frame, split-level in this suburb across the harbor.
   Troughton's job with a car rental agency was not washed away.
During the more than a week they were without electricity, a
generator powered a television and small lamp, and relatives
brought in spaghetti, fried chicken and gas to cook with.
   On Sunday, with power restored, Troughton said they ``almost
feel livable again.''
   But the rhythm of their lives changed. Days are filled with
removing trees and scrubbing house, nights with uneasy sleep.
   The Troughtons, both 36, and their oldest son, Scott, 15, are
coping. Two younger boys were sent to relatives in Georgia until
some normalcy returned. Troughton said Sunday they should be home
in a day or so.
   The storm began its destructive trip up the East Coast about two
miles from the Troughtons' home when it ripped through Sullivans
Island and the Isle of Palms.
   The family delayed departing until too late, in part over
concern for their English bulldog, who wouldn't be allowed in an
emergency shelter.
   By the time the eye of the storm passed around midnight, they
knew they had made a mistake.
   ``I thought how foolish I was to have stayed with three kids
through that. I was really angry with myself,'' Mrs. Troughton said.
   Though the family lost 11 tall pines, including four that
demolished their station wagon, Hugo left only a leaky roof and a
torn corner on the house.
   ``I feel very lucky _ very, very lucky,'' Scott said.
   The first day after the storm was spent on the telephone with
family and friends checking on their safety.
   With power gone since the previous evening, food was in danger
of spoiling. Mrs. Troughton used the barbecue grill, and about 50
hamburgers were cooked up and sent to neighbors.
   Nightfall brought an eerie sense of danger, as a 7 p.m. curfew
and no electricity turned the neighborhood into a tomb.
   ``At night around here, it's almost scary,'' she said. ``At
night, there are so few cars moving that when one does, it's like,
`What's going on?'. ... It's almost like being in a war zone.''
   They received their first shipment of supplies from relatives
Saturday, two days after Hugo hit: food and butane gas to set up
the stove in the garage. By then they were also housing four
friends to help remove trees, and another waiting to return to his
home on the Isle of Palms.
   On Sunday, Mrs. Troughton realized she missed going to church
only when she saw a neighbor heading that way. ``I'm still confused
about what day it is,'' she said a week after the storm.
   Sunday brought more supplies from relatives as well as a painful
decision: The two younger boys would be safer away from home.
   ``My 3-year-old was turning on the butane tank. ... My
11-year-old was out there with an ax cutting down trees,'' she said.
   Monday brought soaking rains that drove everyone inside to
powerless homes, making residents increasingly claustrophobic.
   ``You just feel so closed up in here,'' she said.
   Some respite came when men from the neighborhood gathered in
someone's garage to watch ``Monday Night Football'' on a
generator-powered television.
   ``People are living in the garages,'' Troughton said. ``They're
sitting and talking in the garage. They're drinking in the garage.
They're playing cards in the garage. They're swapping lies in the
garage.''
   Their physical possessions safe, the Troughtons counted their
losses in convenience, togetherness and emotional security.
   ``You walk around and you try to smile and help and all,'' she
said. ``And then you say, `Forget it. I'm sick of being nice about
this hurricane. ... I'm tired of being nice to people. No, you
can't have my eggs. No, you can't have my gas.'''
   The feeling lasted until Wednesday, when she committed herself
to scrubbing the caked-on mud from the kitchen floor and sneaked
into an apartment house laundry room to wash clothes. Scott got a
chance to see his friends when the high school football team
resumed practice, and the next day, Troughton returned to his job.
   The old routine is still not back.
   ``I think probably it's going to be like somebody's ill. You
might cruise through it pretty good, but then six months later ...
you will think back and think how terrible it was,'' she said.
   ``In my wildest dreams, I could not imagine a hurricane doing
this.''

   By day, Bricola Coleman's neighborhood in
northwest Atlanta looks like any middle-class area with its neat
yards, brick apartment complexes, churches, small shops and trees.
   By night, it is a drug-infested warren of pushers, hookers,
drunks and overworked police, whose arrival is met by a cacophony
of voices shouting ``Twelve! Twelve!'' _ a street slang signal from
lookouts that the police are coming.
   But it was by day, not night, that 12-year-old Bricola was
murdered.
   Fear of retaliation and a conspiracy of silence have hobbled the
push to find her killer, but police say they are sure somebody saw
something.
   To those who knew her, Bricola represented the daylight side of
northwestern Atlanta, a bright, imaginative, deeply religious
seventh-grader who studied hard, stayed out of trouble and dreamed
of a career as an actress or dancer.
   On Sept. 12, she arrived home from school and telephoned her
mother at her job. She took the family's clothes to the laundry
room two buildings away and returned to the apartment.
   When Della Belle Coleman arrived home, she found her daughter on
the kitchen floor, strangled with a jump rope, badly beaten on the
head and sexually assaulted with a broomstick.
   Bricola had often said, ``Mamma, we've got to move,'' Mrs.
Coleman recalled later.
   Now neighborhood utility poles carry offers of a $10,000 reward
and a promise of anonymity for anyone with information leading to
the killer.
   Lt. P.T. Umphress, the night supervisor of the zone where the
killing occurred, said the murder appears to be one of opportunity,
not directly tied to drugs but likely done by elements brought to
the projects by the drug trade.
   ``The dealers attract all sorts of thugs,'' he said.
   He described the area as basically stable _ Mrs. Coleman has
lived in her subsidized three-bedroom apartment 10 years _ but
flooded in the past three years or so by crack dealers. Crime, he
estimated, jumped tenfold.
   ``People in these buildings came to terms with the dope dealers
years ago,'' policeman Larry Richardson said. ``They even got used
to the dope-related killings. But a sweet, innocent little girl
like that _ they won't put up with it. Mothers, especially, are
talking and they don't care who knows it or sees them.''
   A group of more than 100 volunteer civilians organized by state
Sen. Arthur Langford has gone door-to-door seeking anybody who saw
anything.
   ``People who will not talk to the police will talk to people
they trust; they know the history of our organization,'' Langford
said. ``A lot of addicts won't share information with the police
but they will share it with us.''
   He said his group, the United Youth Adult Conference, which has
done similar canvassing in other cases, including the Atlanta child
killings of the 1970s and 1980s, has turned considerable
information over to police.
   But there is no sign so far that the right person is talking.
   ``I'll stake my badge that somebody knows and they aren't
talking,'' said Lt. Horace Walker, who heads the homicide unit.
   One recent day, Richardson drove through the neighborhood.
   At one apartment complex, he bantered with a confident,
gold-toothed youth whose friends scattered when the patrol car
pulled into sight. The youth gave cocky advice on how to catch drug
dealers.
   He was, Richardson said later, a major crack supplier, ``one of
the big boys'' who never actually carries the stuff.
   ``The ones that ran, they were the ones that were holding
(drugs). And the girl with him was his 16-year-old girlfriend. She
knows every damn thing that goes on in these projects. And she
isn't telling any of it.''
   For now, at least, the activity following Bricola Coleman's
slaying has driven the pushers to other complexes nearby.
   It's another story a mile or so away at Bankhead Courts, among
the roughest in Atlanta, where groups of young men Richardson says
are pushers wave at passing patrol cars and fights and robberies
are so common they often go unreported.
   Many buildings are boarded up, some firebombed in drug wars.
   ``You talk to the old people, they'll tell you that when this
was built it was one of the best communities ever,'' he said.
``Then their children grew up.''

<HEAD>Democrats Put on Political Defensive in Capital Gains Struggle</HEAD>

   Republicans are on the offensive, papering the
districts of House Democrats with identically worded press releases
accusing them of casting ``a vote in favor of higher taxes.''
   Only the names were changed on the attack releases that flowed
from the House Republican campaign committee.
   Democrats had their own tax plan in the House, one they thought
was a politically sexy idea _ revival of Individual Retirement
Accounts.
   But from the Democrats there was only silence bordering on
embarrassment. After all, Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, chairman
of the House Democratic campaign committee was one of 64 Democrats
who ended up in the Republican president's corner on the question
of cutting taxes on capital gains.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell insists he has the votes
in the Senate to defeat the president's plan, but acknowledges
there is a good chance a retooled version could pass the Senate.
   To say the Democrats have mishandled the tax fight so far
suggests gross understatement. Not only were the Republicans
positioned on the side of cutting taxes, the Democrats
underestimated the appeal of that tax cut among the small business
interests and entrepeneurs party leaders still hope vote for the
party of Franklin Roosevelt.
   The attempt to offer an IRA revival as an alternative came
across as a belated effort to undermine the capital gains cut and
included a rate increase for about 600,000 of the wealthiest
taxpayers.
   There were perfectly reasonable arguments against the capital
gains proposal.
   But the political bottom line was that it was a tax cut.
   There were perfectly reasonable arguments in favor of nailing
the wealthy to finance a restoration of IRAs.
   But the political bottom line was that it was a tax increase.
   It is such simplifications that provide the edge in the press
release politics of today.
   Democrats still rankle at the memory of how Michael Dukakis'
veto _ on constitutional grounds _ of legislation to require
teachers to lead daily recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance was
used during the 1988 presidential campaign to question the
Massachusetts governor's patriotism.
   The flag, the pollution in Boston Harbor, the state prison
furlough program _ all were issues that lent themselves to
oversimplification and the Republicans exploited them.
   That ugly election is over and now Democrats are champing at the
bit in their eagerness to take on George Bush.
   William Galston and Elaine Kamarck, two former advisers to 1984
Democratic presidential nominee Walter F. Mondale, began a recent
article by describing what they call their party's ``current
disarray _ so evident in its failure to mount an effective
opposition to the Bush administration.''
   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown told party officials
meeting across town from the Capitol that every where he travels
Democrats ask him ``when are you going to take the gloves off?''
   He took them off, but as luck would have it, he was denouncing
the capital gains tax cut as a ``giveaway to the ultra rich,''
within minutes of the House vote on which 64 Democrats gave the
president his margin of victory.
   The chairman did what he had to do. He called the defectors
``good Democrats'' and said he realized they had their reasons for
voting the way they did.
   ``Many of the members who didn't vote with the leadership
position thought they were doing what was in the best interests of
their constituents,'' said the party chairman.
   He recoiled at the suggestion the defectors might not be ``good
Democrats.''
   ``There is no litmus test in the Democratic Party,'' he said.
``There is no single issue on which we read people out if the
party. That would be ridiculous.''
   If nothing else, it showed Brown learned something from the
experience eight years ago when party leaders railed at the
Southern conservatives _ the boll weevils _ who supported Ronald
Reagan's tax and budget cuts in 1981.
   The strongest action was taken against then-Democratic Rep. Phil
Gramm of Texas. Gramm resigned his House seat, switched parties and
was re-elected as a Republican. In 1984, he easily won election to
the Senate.
   If the House vote on capital gains proved anything, it was that
challenging a president early in his term, when he is riding high
in the polls, is a delicate business.
   It requires a careful choice of issues and a willingness to
absorb a few defeats.
   Right now the Republicans are sending out the press releases and
hoping to put the Democrats on the defensive. The odds are the
Democrats will have their opportunities to crow, and the reality is
that Bush has yet to be tested.

   At 7, Igor Ladan is already about 6 feet
tall and weighs 200 pounds. He's come thousands of miles from his
native Soviet Union in hopes doctors can remove a dangerous tumor
from his skull and stop his abnormal growth.
   Mayo Clinic surgeons plan to remove a rare pituitary gland tumor
from the boy doctors call a ``pituitary giant.''
   Igor and his mother, Svitlana Ladan, arrived here three weeks
ago after she waged a worldwide letter-writing campaign from her
native city of Kiev to find treatment for her son. The costs of the
boy's care are being donated.
   ``I was so happy, I nearly died,'' Ladan said last week through
a translator.
   ``People think 6 feet, not 6 years,'' said Nina Sahulenko, a
relative from Phoenix who is translating for the Ladans. ``But he's
still a child. He likes to play. When there are children around, he
will find those his own age.''
   Like other kids, Igor loves apple juice and gum and bananas and
ice cream, she said. And like other kids, he reveled in the
surprise birthday party his new friends in Rochester had when he
turned 7 recently.
   Igor is taking drugs to shrink the tumor from its tennis-ball
dimensions to a size that doctors hope will allow surgical removal
in about three months.
   The benign but still dangerous tumor at the base of his brain,
as well as his unusual size, are caused by an overproduction of
growth hormone by the pituitary gland.
   Igor seemed normal at birth, according to the family, but by six
months, he was the size of a 1-year-old. At one year, he was
equivalent to a 3-year-old.
   When doctors in Kiev and Moscow had no treatment, Igor's mother
wrote to the Red Cross in Switzerland, which advised her to write
to doctors and hospitals in countries such as England and the
United States.
   ``There were times she thought it was the end of the world,''
said Sahulenko, who is staying with the Ladans in special housing
for children undergoing treatment at the clinic.
   But letter followed letter, inquiry after inquiry.
   ``She is a mother,'' said Sahulenko. ``What else could she do?''
   The glasnost-era easing of travel and other restrictions on
Soviet citizens also helped, she said. ``Otherwise he'd never be
here.''
   The family eventually was referred to the Mayo Clinic and Dr.
Donald Zimmerman, a pediatric endocrinologist they now call ``the
miracle doctor.''
   Because the family lacks money and insurance, Zimmerman asked
the clinic to absorb the costs of Igor's care, and a pharmaceutical
house agreed to donate medicine.
   ``People have been so good since the moment she stepped from the
airplane,'' Sahulenko said. ``That is something wonderful in
America.''
   After the operation, radiation and follow-up drug therapy should
complete the removal of the tumor and stop the excess production of
growth hormone, a Mayo Clinic spokeswoman said Sunday.
   Zimmerman said last week that the boy's overall health is good,
although there is concern the tumor could press on the optic nerves
and interfere with his vision.
   Even without a tumor, he said, people with excess growth hormone
can develop problems such as nerve and muscle disease, degenerative
arthritis and enlarged heart muscles, and sometimes have tremendous
psychological and social problems because of their size.

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said
Sunday he has the votes to defeat the House-passed version of
President Bush's capital gains tax cut, a measure he likened to
crack cocaine.
   However, Mitchell acknowledged that a revised version might have
enough support to win narrow approval because Bush's
``irresponsible position ... makes it extremely difficult to
prevent any tax cut from occurring.''
   Interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' the Maine Democrat
said he is positive the 27-month capital gains tax cut approved by
the House last week will not be enacted by the Senate.
   ``It is so bad, so wrong for the economy,'' he said. ``It will
do for the deficit what crack does for the user: a quick short high
followed by a long, painful depression.''
   The measure would reduce from 33 percent to 19.6 percent the
maximum tax rate on profits from the sale of stocks and other
investments until 1992. The rate then would climb back to 28
percent with assets indexed so that any gains attributed to
inflation after that point would not be taxed.
   Its attractiveness to lawmakers stems from predictions by
economists that a selloff by investors rushing to cash in on the
low-rate window would generate $9.4 billion in additional tax
revenue over the next three years.
   After then, however, the revenues would fall dramatically and
actually worsen the deficit by a total of $21 billion over the
following five years, according to Congress' Joint Committee on
Taxation.
   ``I'm confident that this so-called yo-yo _ on two years, off
two years _ and the way in which it's constructed cannot pass,''
Mitchell said. ``There's a growing realization that it will be bad
for the economy ... and will do nothing for the future of this
country.''
   While saying he personally opposes any cut in capital gains
taxes now, Mitchell acknowledged that many members of his party
favor enacting a differential that would tax capital gains at a
lower rate than wages, interest or dividend income.
   ``Whether or not they will coalesce behind any plan along with
Republicans, I don't know,'' he said. ``It will be very close on
some other plan.''
   A majority of Senate Democrats have united behind an alternative
plan proposed by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, to restore up to
$1,000 a year of tax deductibility for contributions to Individual
Retirement Accounts. IRA deductibility ended in 1987 under the
loophole-closing tax law a year earlier that also raised the rate
on capital gains.
   House Democratic leaders tried the same IRA substitute, but
linked it to an increase in taxes on families with incomes of more
than $145,000 a year.
   Mitchell said Senate Democrats will not link their IRA proposal
to such an increase, but rather will propose to make up revenue
lost to expanded IRA deductions by extending telephone and other
excise taxes that were due to expire at the end of this year.
   Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley predicted on the same
program that the House probably will vote this week to repeal
Medicare catastrophic health care coverage that it enacted last
year for some 33 million elderly Americans.
   Many beneficiaries, especially the wealthier among them, have
balked at having to pay premiums this year of up to $800 to help
cover medical expenses for retirees of more modest means.
   ``I hope personally that the program is retained on a modified
form,'' said Foley, D-Wash. ``But ... there are a great number of
Republicans and some Democrats in the House who are in favor of
repeal. If I were guessing today, I think it probably would be
repealed.''
   Foley also said it is doubtful that Congress will complete
action on a deficit-reduction bill, which would include any tax
measure, before the Oct. 16 deadline.
   That is the date broad spending cuts in both military and
domestic programs would be triggered automatically unless Congress
comes up with $6 billion in new revenues or program cuts for
reducing the budget deficit for fiscal year 1990, which began
Sunday.
   ``We might have some few days in which there would be a
technical sequestration, that is an across-the-board cutting
through executive order of all the accounts,'' Foley said. ``I
don't think that's going to be a permanent situation.''

   New Jersey's race for governor has taken a
very nasty road with the two candidates taking turns denying their
opponent's latest allegation of wrongdoing or impropriety, and then
making one of their own.
   ``Once someone goes into the mud, he drags the other candidate
in with him,'' said Gov. Thomas H. Kean, the popular Republican who
is barred from the state constitution from running for a third
consecutive term. ``With campaigns like this, the voters lose.''
   The sharp volleys between seven-term Democratic Rep. James
Florio, 52, the front-runner in recent polls, and five-term
Republican Rep. James Courter, 47, have become more frequent. And a
televised debate last week granted both their most public forum yet.
   A Florio television commercial accuses Courter of dumping toxic
waste on his own property, but Courter says the allegation is
``just plain wrong.'' Florio, in turn, said a Courter accusation
that his law firm allows drug dealers back onto the street is
``slimy.''
   One of two gubernatorial races this year _ the other is in
Virginia _ the campaign has degenerated into an exchange of
personal attacks that have eclipsed top issues such tax reform,
drug abuse, high automobile insurance rates and abortion.
   In a raging battle over ethics, Courter accused Florio of
obtaining a free stake in land in Camden County. Florio said he
took out a loan to buy an interest in the land, which he eventually
donated to his alma mater, Trenton State College.
   Florio leveled his own conflict of interest charges, saying
Courter's law firm represented Westinghouse Electric Co., a defense
contractor, while Courter was a member of the Armed Services
Committee. Courter said his place on the committee was never
compromised.
   Three independent polls released last week show Florio with a
substantial lead over Courter. One, conducted by Political Media
Research Poll for a group of media outlets, showed Florio with a
14-point lead.
   Results of a poll released Saturday by the Eagleton Institute of
Rutgers University found Courter trailing by 23 points. A separate
poll by the Record of Hackensack found the Republican trailing by
16 points.
   The election is Nov. 7.
   The race comes only a year after a notoriously dirty U.S. Senate
campaign in New Jersey which featured, among other things,
unsuccessful Republican challenger Pete Dawkins calling Sen. Frank
Lautenberg a ``swamp dog.''
   ``I don't think there was ever much doubt that this
(gubernatorial race) was going to become a mudslinging and
name-calling campaign,'' said Rick Sinding, president of the Center
for Analysis of Public Issues in Princeton. ``Unfortunately, there
is a growing belief that negative campaigns work. In the debate,
they were like two little kids kicking sand on each other.''
   Leaders of each campaign insist their charges are accurate and
that the other side is distorting the truth. They both say they are
waging ``positive'' campaigns, but won't let their opponent's
charges go unchallenged.
   A Florio television advertisement saying the state was forced to
order Courter and his brother to remove drums of fuel oil from land
they owned clearly angered Courter. Environmental officials say the
spill of oil was not significant, but it took the Courters nearly
two years to remove the drums.
   ``I was the victim of a midnight dumper,'' said Courter.
   ``The clear implication in the ads is that Jim Courter utilized
his land as a toxic waste dump, and that's a vicious personal
attack,'' said Republican leader Robert Franks, an adviser to the
Courter campaign.
   Florio aides had similar comments about a Courter ad accusing
Florio of profiting from his law firm's defense of drug dealers.
   Florio, whose forte in Congress is environmental issues, wants
to counter pro-environment advertisements by Courter, who is rated
by the environmental lobby in Congress at the bottom of the state's
14-member delegation.
   Courter is attempting to paint Florio as soft on crime, saying
his opposition to a proposal that would loosen restrictions on
evidence favors criminals rather than victims.

   West Germany's ambassador opened
his embassy Sunday to 200 newly arrived East Germans who missed the
departure of the last freedom train crammed with their countrymen.
   ``Come on in all of you, slowly,'' Ambassador Hermann Huber said
to a jubilant crowd that spent a day waiting outside the closed
compound. ``I am going to take care of you temporarily.''
   An agreement between West Germany and Communist East Berlin on
Saturday cleared the way for the exodus of thousands of East
Germans who had been holed up at Bonn's embassies in Prague and
Warsaw for several weeks.
   Trains left Prague Saturday night and Sunday with an estimated
6,000 refugees and another 800 left Warsaw today.
   East Germany said the transfer was a one-time occurrence, but
refugees hearing of the exodus began flooding embasies in those
East bloc capitals anyway in hopes of also securing safe passage to
the West.
   In Prague, uniformed Czechoslovak police blocked the embassy and
squad cars later were positioned in all the streets leading to the
compound. All late arrivals, East Germans were turned back, but not
before about 200 had gathered in front.
   The crowd of latecomers _ most of them young, some with small
children _ milled about or sat in front of the embassy gate despite
word from an employee over the intercom system that the building
was closed for the day.
   Their growing desperation ended abruptly at 5 p.m., when the
policemen in front of the gate moved aside and Huber appeared.
   Later Sunday, the West German Foreign Ministry in Bonn summoned
Czechoslovak Ambasssador Dusan Spacil late Sunday to formally
protest the police presence around the Prague embassy.
   In a brief appearance earlier, Huber had urged the refugees to
go back home.
   ``Last night was a one-time situation,'' he said earlier of the
exodus of thousands of East Germans on trains from Prague and
Warsaw to West Germany. ``The occupation of the embassy will not
improve the situation.''
   However, it was unclear now how Bonn would respond to the second
wave of would-be emigres or whether East Germany would allow
another transfer.
   In Warsaw, dozens of East Germans also waited outside the West
German Embassy, including some who missed the train to the West by
only a few minutes.
   The glum-looking refugees sat in cars or milled about the
street, filling out forms for the embassy staff and wondering where
they would spend the night.
   Several said they were convinced that eventually there would be
another train for them.
   The agreement between East and West Germany allowing the exodus
highlighted the dramatic political changes at work in the East bloc
as Warsaw Pact nations slowly follow the lead of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has initiated widespread reform in his
own country.
   The reform-oriented leadership in Hungary was the first to take
up the challenge presented by the East German refugees, opening its
western border to them on Sept. 10.
   East Germany, Czechoslovakia and other hard-line Warsaw Pact
countries have been critical of Hungary for opening its border.
   Poland was reluctant to antagonize its ally in Berlin despite
the enormous political changes in Warsaw that led to the advent of
the first East bloc government not led Communists. But Polish
officials did not inhibit the movement of the refugees around the
city, so they did not have to be crammed into embassy grounds.
   The hard-line government in Prague pledged not to let East
Germans emigrate to the West through its territory. But on
Saturday, West German television showed Czechoslovak police
standing by idly as refugees prepared for their trip west.
   More than 100,000 East Germans have emigrated to West Germany
this year, taking advantage of a law automatically granting them
citizenship on arrival.
   Among them are about 25,000 who emigrated over Hungary's western
border. West German border police in Munich said Sunday nearly
1,000 East Germans arrived via Austria from Hungary overnight _ the
highest number in recent days.

   Patrons at Matt's Saloon couldn't believe
their luck when rock superstar Bruce Springsteen arrived by
motorcyle unannounced, ordered a beer and wound up in a one-hour
jam session with the house band.
   Springsteen drove up to the country-western bar in northwest
Arizona on Friday after traveling from Los Angeles.
   Denny Orr, rhythm guitarist for The Mile High Band, said he
noticed Springsteen enter the bar and ``the next thing I knew, he
said, `Come on, boys. Let's jam.'''
   Springsteen played ``I'm On Fire'' from his 1984 multiplatinum
``Born In The USA'' album plus several covers of oldies such as
``Don't Be Cruel,'' ``Sweet Sixteen'' and ``Route 66,'' Orr said.
   The band asked him to play ``Pink Cadillac,'' but Springsteen
said he couldn't remember the words to his hit song.
   Springsteen, wearing a leather vest and a bandana around his
neck, ``was having a good time, talking to the regulars and
drinking beer before word spread and the bar's attendance swelled
``from 7 or 8 people to 80 or 90 in 10 minutes,'' Orr said. ``It
went nuts.''
   Jeff Casserly, a reporter for the Prescott Courier who attended
the impromptu show, said Springsteen declined to be interviewed
after the jam session, but posed for photographers with a local
biker before heading out of town.
   Springsteen ran from autograph-seekers, jumped on his motorcycle
and roared up U.S. Highway 89 trailed by his four bodyguards _
three on cycles and another in a van.
   Orr said Springsteen told him he was on ``vacation'' and on his
way to visit the Grand Canyon.

   For some U.N. soldiers in Namibia, life
is mostly fun and games. For others it's more like a bowl of cold
gruel.
   Troops from some nations, such as Finland, receive the full pay
provided by the United Nations and often frequent Windhoek's best
restaurants and liveliest discos. A number of Finns have bought
luxury sports cars that cost far less than in their homeland, where
imported vehicles face huge surcharges.
   The less fortunate Polish soldiers get the same pay as at home,
with their government pocketing the remainder of the U.N. stipend.
Off-duty Poles are most easily found at U.N. canteens or on public

   Among the most popular U.N. troops are a group of Fijians who
arrived unannounced one night at the usually all-white Hotel
Stroblhof bar in the conservative desert town of Karibib.
   When they pulled out musical instruments and began an impromptu
concert, the Fijians initially drew withering stares. Eventually,
the regulars began to smile, and later they started dancing. The
Fijians are now the featured act on Wednesday and Saturday nights
at the Stroblhof.
   The Fijian contingent also includes some of the South Pacific
nation's top rugby players, who have joined the Karibib squad and
vastly improved the previously mediocre team.

   U.N. troops and Namibians have proved vigorous souvenir-hunters,
unwilling to settle for the run-of-the-mill gift shop trinkets.
   A group of 30 Malaysians were accused of hacking away chunks of
the Hoba meteorite, reportedly the largest on earth and an official
landmark in Namibia.
   The special license plates on U.N. vehicles (such as UNTAG 10,
UNTAG 11, etc.) have been disappearing so quickly that officials
decided to simply paint letters and numbers onto the bodies of the
vehicles rather than constantly try to replace the plates.
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said his 13-year-old son has a
friend who has acquired 17 plates.
   The head of the U.N. contingent, Martti Ahtisaari, still has his
original plates (UNTAG 1), but collectors are now offering more
than 400 rand ($150) for them, no questions asked.

   The South-West Africa People's Organization, the black

when President Sam Nujoma returned from 30 years of exile Sept. 14.
   SWAPO leaders promised an afternoon press conference in
Katutura, the sprawling black neighborhood on the edge of Windhoek
but couldn't decide on a venue.
   About 100 journalists spent almost two hours randomly
criss-crossing the dusty, unmarked streets before they stumbled on
the location _ a private house with a driveway full of luxury cars
flying the SWAPO flag.
   However, dozens of other journalists, including a group of
Americans who had chartered a plane from South Africa to report on
Nujoma's homecoming, never found the SWAPO leader.

   Britain's opposition Labor Party began its annual
conference Sunday poised to shift the socialist movement toward the
center and dump its vote-losing doctrine of unilateral nuclear
disarmament.
   As the weeklong conference opened in Brighton, public opinion
polls published Sunday showed Labor in its strongest position since
it lost power to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives
in 1979.
   ``The electorate now regards the Labor Party as electable, which
it did not in 1983 or 1987,'' said Gerald Kaufman, the party's
foreign affairs spokesman, referring to Labor's last two general
election defeats.
   The policy overhaul, endorsed last spring by the party's
28-member national executive committee, is virtually assured of
being adopted during a series of debates beginning Monday because
of committed support from leaders of major trade unions.
   Trade union bosses have the biggest say at Labor's policy-making
conferences under a controversial system that gives them huge block
votes based on the number of union members.
   Already the proposed new platform, which the Conservatives
dismiss as a cosmetic exercise by an avowedly leftist party, has
helped transform Labor's fortunes.
   In June, Labor trounced the Conservatives in elections for the
European Parliament, and has since led by 3 to 12 percentage points
in every national opinion poll.
   Five polls commissioned by Sunday newspapers put Labor between
five and 12 points ahead. They ranged from Market and Opinion
Research International in the pro-Tory Sunday Times of London,
which put Labor at 43 percent of the vote and the Conservatives at
38 percent, to Labor's 46 percent vs. the Conservatives' 34 percent
in a National Opinion Poll sampling for another Tory supporter, The
Mail on Sunday.
   None of the three other national parties, two squabbling
centrist parties and the environmentalist Green Party, got more
than 10 percent.
   The National Opinion Poll polled 989 voters on Sept. 25; Market
and Opinion Research questioned 1,739 between Sept. 21 and 26.
Neither newspaper provided the margin of error.
   A key point for Labor leader Neil Kinnock is that polls show
support consistently topping 40 percent, a share that under
Britain's electoral system is usually sufficient to give a party an
outright majority in the 650-member House of Commons.
   After a decade of humiliation, Labor also has been boosted by a
sense among many voters that Thatcherism has gone too far, and by
the collapse of the center parties, which in 1983 and 1987 split
the anti-Conservative vote.
   But Labor's task remains daunting.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who does not have to call an election until 1992,
won last time with a huge 102-seat majority.
   To regain outright power, Labor would need to win 97 new seats,
including some Conservative strongholds in Britain's prosperous
south, and achieve the biggest swing against a British government
since World War II.
   Polls, which put Labor well ahead on issues such as health,
education and welfare, also show many voters doubtful about the
socialists' ability to manage the economy.
   The proposed new policy package, the result of a two-year review
Kinnock ordered after the 1987 election, has dismayed the party's
vocal left wing.
   It stipulates that a Labor-led government would give up
Britain's nuclear weapons only in a negotiated arms deal.
   This overturns Labor's pledge, adopted in 1981 as the party
lurched left after losing power, to scrap Britain's
submarine-launched missiles and shut down U.S. nuclear bases within
five years of coming to power.
   For Kinnock, 47, once an ardent supporter of unilateral nuclear
disarmament, it represents a major personal shift after two
electoral defeats.
   Other proposed changes include dropping commitments to
renationalize most of the state-owned industries sold off by Mrs.
Thatcher, and retaining some of her curbs on labor unions.

   Lebanese lawmakers clashed Sunday over
the presence of Syrian troops in their country and Christian leader
Gen. Michel Aoun demanded a timetable for their pullout before
agreeing to peace.
   In Beirut, where Aoun made his comments, Christian forces and
Syrian-backed Druse militiamen battled for 15 minutes around the
mountain garrison of Souk al-Gharb, testing a fragile cease-fire.
No casualties were reported.
   Reporters are barred from the parliament sessions in Taif, a
Saudi Arabian resort, and from direct access to the lawmakers.
   But sources at the meeting reported a stormy session Sunday as
the 63 members of parliament _ 33 Christians and 30 Moslems _
gathered for a second day in their bid to end the 14-year-old civil
war and address an Arab League peace plan.
   The session was dominated by disagreements between Christians
and Moslems over what Syria's role in Lebanon should be, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Saudi host Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal played down
the discord.
   ``We do not regard this as disturbing in any way. In fact, it is
a healthy sign that all views are aired and opinions expressed,''
he said.
   He praised former Lebanese Prime Minister Saeb Salaam for
invoking the slogan ``failure is not permissible.''
   Supporters of Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, say they will not agree
to give Moslems a greater share of political power until there is a
timetable for a pullout of the estimated 40,000 Syrian troops in
Lebanon.
   Syrian troops first entered Lebanon in 1976 as part of an Arab
League peacekeeping force. They initially sought to curb Moslem
factions, but wound up fighting the Christians and Aoun says they
have lost their mandate.
   Syrian-backed Moslem leaders support a continuing role for Syria
to protect their position and help guarantee a settlement of
Lebanon's civil war.
   Moslem lawmakers argued that Syria should stay in Lebanon until
Israel withdraws from a southern Lebanese border strip it has
occupied since 1982. Israel says the strip, six to 10 miles wide,
is a security zone.
   Iraq has been supplying weapons to the Christians, partly to get
even with Syria for backing Iran, Iraq's enemy, in the eight-year
Persian Gulf war.
   Damascus has said it will not consider a withdrawal until its
Moslem allies are given an equal share of power with the
Christians, who have dominated the executive, army and judiciary
since Lebanon gained independence in 1943.
   Moslems are now believed to make up 55 percent of the poulation,
although there has been no official census since 1932.
   Addressing supporters in Beirut on Sunday, Aoun said: ``We shall
accept nothing now that we have rejected in the past because our
demands are indivisible. ... We have waged war to achieve peace.''
   ``Our only essential goal is to liberate our land and
re-establish sovereignty over Lebanon's entire territory. We shall
not compromise the blood of our martyrs,'' Auon said.
   His remarks appeared to be a response to pressures on Christian
lawmakers in Taif to agree to postpone discussion of Syria's role
until after the election of a new president, formation of a new
government and agreement on political reforms.
   Under that scenario, the Syrians then would begin to withdraw
from Moslem west Beirut and regroup in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa
Valley. The withdrawal from the greater Beirut area would be
completed in two years, according to officials in Beirut.
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since former President
Amin Gemayel's six-year term ended on Sept. 22, 1988.
   Gemayel named Aoun a caretaker prime minister before he left
office, but Moslems rejected the appointment and said acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, is the legitimate head of
government.

<TEXT>
   There's a mayoral election in Atlanta this
Tuesday, but you'd be hard pressed to prove it, as the quiet return
of former Mayor Maynard Jackson has unfolded with hardly a hitch.
   Jackson, the city's mayor from 1974-82, has kept a low profile
during the two terms of his successor, Andrew Young. But at 51, he
remains popular _ so much so that his chief challenger, Fulton
County Commission Chairman Michael Lomax, suddenly quit the race in
August amid dismal poll showings.
   ``I'm just a nice guy,'' Jackson chuckles.
   At the last minute, veteran civil rights activist Hosea Williams
quit his City Council seat and entered the race, predicting a
miracle but also running, admittedly, to make Jackson put up some
kind of a fight.
   ``I've already accomplished one of my major victories _ to make
Maynard campaign,'' Williams said last week. ``If it hadn't been
for me, he would have walked back into City Hall scot-free.''
   But Williams has not gotten exactly the fight he sought. The
former mayor refused a one-on-one debate, even after Williams tried
to force the challenge by fasting, which only left him thinner and
weary. (The fast brought in one campaign contribution: a new pair
of suspenders from a backer.)
   With only $15,000 or so in campaign donations, Williams has been
forced to rely on a few radio ads to get his message out, along
with yard signs proclaiming him ``The Clique-Buster'' _ a slap at
Jackson, whom he brands part of a ``super-rich, small, black
elitist clique.''
   Jackson's staff has concentrated on making sure their supporters
bother to vote.
   ``The apathy out there is much stronger than I expected,''
Jackson said. ``We're fighting hard for a respectable turnout.
   ``What we're fighting for is a mandate. I want to make sure I'm
not walking up Calvary alone. The more people vote, the more people
feel invested in the future of the city.''
   Four longshots round out the non-partisan ballot: nightclub
comedian Jerry Farber, bus driver and anti-abortion activist
Mitchell Williams, Georgia Tech student Mark Teal, and Lafayette
Perry, who is unemployed.
   Young is ineligible for a third consecutive term, as was Jackson
eight years ago when he left the mayor's office for the life of a
high-paid bond lawyer. Young is now mounting a race for governor in
1990.
   The quiet of the campaign is surprising, considering the
presence of the talkative, growling Hosea Williams. News reports
barely mention the campaign, focusing instead on what Jackson's
third term will be like.
   Jackson, an erudite, eloquent man, became Atlanta's first black
mayor in 1973, five years after he turned some heads with a
longshot challenge to veteran Sen. Herman Talmadge.
   Now Jackson seems headed for coronation.
   ``Even I've been surprised,'' he said. ``That long out of
office, when you look at our numbers ...
   ``The toughest job in politics is being a mayor. Every day you
make 10 people happy and 10 people mad. People want _ people crave
_ strong leadership. And that's what I've always tried to give.''
   In his previous terms, Jackson was a bold young mayor locked in
contention with the city's largely white business community, as he
insisted on minority participation in city business. Other problems
arose: A 1977 garbage strike shook the city, and his public safety
commissioner quit in 1978 amid allegations that he had helped
supporters cheat on promotion exams.
   Though black himself, Williams has been a longtime critic of the
city's black power structure, saying those blacks in power have not
done enough for poor people. He blames Jackson for derailing the
city from its ``history of continuous progression.'' He charges
that under Jackson, crime increased, the police department was
demoralized and hit by corruption, and infrastructure needs went
unmet.
   But Jackson's eight years in office the opening of the city's
rapid transit system and the construction of a huge new airport
complex.
   This time out, he is courting white business support _ even
though he probably doesn't need it to win in a city where 61
percent of the 192,000 registered voters are black.
   Jackson's priorities this time are the problems of Atlanta and
numerous other cities: drug-fueled crime and a need for low-income
housing.
   Jackson calls his platform ``five for the future'' _ fighting
drugs and crime, building better housing, promoting economic
development, well-managed government and improving the quality of
life.
   That is not the agenda of a bond attorney.
   ``I love the law,'' he said. ``I love the practice of law. But
the reality is that politics is my ministry. I want to do something
to make a difference. The only thing I have in mind is serving this
city as mayor.
   ``We're going to show ourselves, and the nation, how great a
city can be.''

<HEAD>Runcie Clarifies Statement on Pope After Protestant Clergy Disrupt
Mass</HEAD>

   Anglican leader Robert Runcie, criticized for
suggesting the pope play a leadership role for Anglicans, declared
Sunday he had not meant the pontiff should administer the affairs
of the Church of England.
   Runcie issued the statement hours after three Protestant
clergymen interrupted his Sunday sermon by shouting that his
four-day visit to the Vatican was ``a betrayal.''
   Runcie, who as archbishop of Canterbury is spiritual head of the
state Church of England and leader of the world's 70 million
Anglicans, is making his first official trip to the Vatican as part
of a quest to someday bring the churches together.
   He said in his statement that some people had charged his
suggestion to give the pope some sort of primacy among Christians
``subverts the British Constitution.''
   ``This is not the case,'' said the statement. ``The phrase
`universal primacy' has a spiritual meaning. It does not imply
political supremacy and does not suggest that the pope should
administer the affairs of the Church of England.''
   The Anglican church split from the Roman Catholic Church in the
16th century over the pope's refusal to annul King Henry VIII's
marriage to Catherine of Aragon. The queen of England is considered
the temporal head of the Church of England.
   ``When people try to suggest the whole British Constitution is
being subverted, it's just someone trying to make a story or stir
things up,'' the Rev. Canon Christopher Hill, secretary for
ecumenical affairs to the archbishop, told reporters.
   Neither Hill nor the statement said who was doing the
criticizing, but the Rev. Ian Paisley delivered a protest to
Runcie's spokeswoman Saturday accusing the Anglican leader of
``high treason.''
   Paisley, a Northern Ireland Protestant leader, also assailed
Runcie for attending a papal Mass in Rome on Sunday. He was the
second archbishop of Canterbury to do so since the Reformation.
   Paisley is head of the Free Presbyterian Church in Northern
Ireland, which is vehemently anti-Catholic.
   Three of Paisley's associates disrupted an Anglican church
service attended by Vatican officials on Sunday.
   As Runcie was about to begin his sermon at All Saints Anglican
church, the three clergymen jumped up and peeled off their jackets,
revealing T-shirts emblazoned ``Runcie is a traitor to Protestant
Britain'' and ``Remember Cranmer.''
   ``Your presence here is a betrayal,'' shouted one of the
clergymen.
   ``Remember Cranmer. Remember his death,'' cried another. Thomas
Cranmer was the first archbishop of Canterbury of the reformed
Church of England, and was burned at the stake by Catholic
authorities in 1556 for promoting Protestantism.
   Ushers hustled the protesters away and police checked their
passports, but no arrests were made. Runcie showed no emotion at
the interruption.
   The protesters identified themselves as the Rev. David Cassells
of Glasgow, Scotland, the Rev. Brian Green of London and the Rev.
David Larner of London, all officers of the British Council of
Protestant Christian Churches.
   Paisley said he did not join the protest because security guards
would not have allowed him into the church.
   Runcie attended an outdoor Mass in St. Peter's Square Sunday
during which Pope John Paul II beatified 29 people. Beatification
is a step toward possible sainthood.
   Runcie was the first archbishop of Canterbury to attend a papal
Mass in Rome since Archbishop Donald Coggan went to the pope's
inauguration in 1978.
   John Paul greeted Runcie during the ceremony in which Catholics
wish each other peace. He did not address the subject of
Catholic-Anglican unity during the Mass.
   In 1960, the late Geoffrey Fisher became the first archbishop of
Canterbury to visit the Vatican since the Reformation.
   In his sermon Sunday, Runcie called again for greater unity
between Anglicans and the world's 850 million Catholics, noting
they already shared many beliefs.
   But despite progress in unity talks in recent years, Anglicans
and Catholics are still divided over issues ranging from birth
control to the meaning of the Eucharist.

<HEAD>Remains of Former Montenegrin King Buried in Yugoslavia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CETINJE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 100,000 people gathered
in this Montenegrin city Sunday to pay homage to the region's last
monarch at a ceremonial reburial 73 years after his exile.
   The state funeral for King Nikola Petrovic-Njegos and Queen
Milena was the first official recognition by Communist Yugoslavia
of the country's royal past.
   Their remains were brought back to his homeland from Italy
Saturday, and the reburial ceremony included pageantry unseen in
this former tiny Balkan kingdom since his coronation.
   An open-air liturgy at Cetinje's monastery was followed by a
colorful procession of Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Moslem clergy
through the city's streets.
   A ceremonial unit of the former Montenegrin Navy, clad in
traditional 17th century uniforms, carried the king's saber and his
many medals, and marched along with Montenegrins in colorful
national costume.
   Nikola ruled Montenegro, now the smallest of Yugoslavia's six
republics, from 1860 to 1916, when he was forced into exile by
advancing Austro-Hungarian troops.
   He died in exile in 1921 and his mountain domain was
incorporated into the newly established south Slav kingdom by his
nephew, Serbian monarch Aleksandar Karadjordjevic.
   The nationally televised burial ceremony provided the first
chance for many Yugoslavs to see members of the Karadjordjevic
family, which reigned until a communist state was established in
1945.
   Tens of thousands lined Cetinje's streets and crowded balconies
and windows to see the cortege pulled by six black horses bearing
the coffins of the royal couple and their two daughters.
   The gun carriage was followed by Nikola's relatives, three
princesses of the exiled Karqdjordjevic dynasty. Other European
aristrocrats in the procession included Prince Vitorrio Emanuele Di
Savoia of Italy, Prince Dimitri Romanov of Russia and Crown Prince
Idriz Senussi of Libya.
   Montenegro's president, Branko Kostic, and other state officials
also attended in what appeared to be an effort by the region's new
Communist leadership to dissociate itself from its predecessors.
   The latest hard-liners were swept out of office in a wave of
popular unrest in January.
   ``The reburial of the royal family in their homeland has long
been put off under the excuse that the appropriate times have still
not come,'' Kostic said.
   Nikola's achievements still evoke pride among the 500,000
Montenegrins, who account for about 5 percent of the Yugoslav
population. In a series of battles against the Ottoman Turks,
Nikola managed to triple the area of his realm and keep it
independent.

<HEAD>Northwest Police Say Tacoma-Style Shootouts in Other Drug Areas Possible</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Frustrated citizens waging their own war on drugs
could become victims of retaliation or spawn more shootouts like
one in Tacoma in which hundreds of rounds were fired, warn police
in several Northwest cities.
   ``The potential is always there,'' said Yakima Police Chief
Pleas Green.
   Spokane Police Lt. Robert Van Leuven agreed and said the same
kind of potential for violence was present ``no matter where you
go.''
   ``There's always a level of frustration within a community,
whether it's a manpower problem or a jail space problem or the
criminal justice system doesn't react as quickly as citizens would
like,'' said police spokesman Dave Simpson of Portland, Ore.
``There is potential for citizens to carry their frustration one
step further and react, rather than wait for police.''
   ``I think there are several spots where that kind of blowup
could occur ... where gangs are trying to establish a turf,'' said
Sgt. Dick Alberthal of the King County Police drug enforcement
unit. King County includes Seattle.
   Police who were interviewed agreed that sales of crack cocaine,
heroin, methedrine and other highly addictive drugs in
neighborhoods previously free of significant drug dealing posed a
danger of violent backlashes.
   The Tacoma shootout involved a block watch organized resident
Bill Foulk, who is an Army staff sergeant in the 2nd Ranger
Battalion at Fort Lewis.
   After a newspaper reported that the group was videotaping what
Foulk and others believed was a ``crack house,'' he was hit by
threats from occupants and habitues of the dwelling.
   When shots were fired at his house during a block watch barbecue
Sept. 23, a dozen of his fellow Rangers were there to return fire.
Police estimated 200 to 300 rounds were fired _ without anyone
being hurt.
   Two people arrested following the fusillade were identified by
police as members of the Hillside Crips, a gang linked to drug
dealing. No Rangers were arrested, although their private firearms
were confiscated.
   Foulk said people working to shut down crack houses should arm
themselves and prepare mutual-aid defense plans with friends and
neighbors.
   ``As soon as you start affecting that (drug income), they are
more than likely to be violent,'' he said. ``I'm not advocating
violence, but I am saying you have to be prepared.''
   Few police said they saw any imminent danger of similar blowups
in their cities.
   ``Even in Tacoma, I think that was a real anomaly,'' said
Seattle police Capt. Harvey Ferguson.
   But Tacoma police spokesman Mark Mann said some neighborhoods
might be even more tense than the Hilltop area. He blamed crack for
a 16 percent increase in violent crime in 1988, citing ``complaints
of drug-related activity'' at 1,000 to 1,200 houses and other sites
throughout the city last year.
   Mann said Tacoma police had reports of anti-drug forces arming
themselves ``but not in a block-watch environment'' or in groups.
   Green in Yakima and Simpson in Portland said their officers try
to encourage grass-roots groups to avoid getting involved with
weapons. Police advise other tactics against dealers instead.
   ``Mobilize the neighborhood. Get the good people together,''
Mann said. ``Let that person (in the target house) know. Invite
that person to a block party.''
   Most officers favor civilians just collecting customers' license
numbers and other details for police.
   ``I would not suggest complaining directly to occupants or
owners,'' advised Van Leuven in Spokane.
   ``These individuals are in a high-risk business, a type of
business where you find the people who are dealing drugs are often
also using the drugs, which means a lot of times you got somebody
under the influence of drugs. This can be very hazardous to your
health.''
   Videotaping drew a more mixed response, partly because
videotapes shot from the street virtually never show identifiable
drugs and thus are worthless in court. Mann said it can invite
violent retaliation.
   ``If you back a little rattlesnake into a corner, he's going to
bite you,'' he said.

   Fistfights and scuffling broke out
among supporters of rival candidates when 6,000 people gathered
Sunday for the filing of nominations for the leadership of a major
political party.
   About 50 riot police moved in to disperse the rival groups. No
one was injured, no arrests were made and order was restored within
15 minutes, police Superintendent Fauzi Shaari told reporters.
   Nominations for party president were being filed at the
headquarters of the Malaysian Indian Congress, the third major

Chinese, Indian and other parties.
   Sangilimuthu Samy Vellu, seeking re-election as party president,
arrived first with supporters bearing banners and placards.
   Party Deputy President Sinniah Subramaniam, another candidate
for president, appeared 90 minutes later, and scuffling and
fistfights broke out when Vellu's supporters jeered at
Subramaniam's supporters.
   Nominations proceeded after order was restored, and 15 were
received for party elections on Oct. 15. Vellu was considered the
front-runner.

<TEXT>
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
arrived here Sunday on an official visit that the Bush
administration hopes will reinforce the steady improvement in
U.S.-Mexican relations. Seven agreements are expected to be signed
during Salinas' stay.
   President Bush, who has met with Salinas twice previously,
invited the Mexican leader to his retreat at Camp David for a
family dinner Sunday evening. A more formal meeting was planned for
the White House on Tuesday.
   The agreements they were to sign during the visit were symbolic
of increased U.S.-Mexican cooperation since Bush and Salinas
assumed the presidency of their respective countries within a few
weeks of each other less than a year ago.
   The pacts cover such issues as trade, investment, the
environment, tourism and law enforcement, according to U.S.
officials.
   Officials from both sides seemed relieved that the spirit of
hostility which characterized cross-border relations during the
Reagan administration has largely disappeared.
   U.S. officials, who briefed reporters Friday on the condition
they not be identified by name, said Mexican authorities have been
very cooperative in attempting to regulate the flow of undocumented
aliens from Central America over the past six months.
   Even more encouraging to the administration has been evidence of
a serious Mexican effort to curb drug smuggling.
   ``There's a major national commitment by the Salinas
administration to drug interdiction,'' one U.S. official told
reporters. He added that 25 percent of Mexico's armed forces work
on drug eradication and interdiction.
   During a visit to Mexico in August, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III hailed Salinas' economic policies as ``bold and
farsighted.''
   U.S. officials believe that Mexico's program of tax reform,
encouraging foreign investment and lowering trade barriers could
serve as a model for other nations struggling to overcome the
effects of a huge foreign debt.
   In July, Mexico reached an agreement with commercial banks that
provides for, among other things, a reduction in the country's debt
servicing obligations. Payments on the country's $107 billion
foreign debt have contributed to a sharp decline in living
standards over the past seven years.
   One official who briefed reporters Friday noted that a year ago
there were widespread predictions of political turmoil and economic
catastrophe in Mexico.
   ``To President Salinas' great credit, he has, I think, surprised
all of the skeptics with his performance politically and
economically. And what he is doing with the Mexican economy is, in
the history of that country, revolutionary,'' the official said.
   U.S.-Mexican tensions also have eased because both countries are
pursuing far less ideological policies in Central America.
   Mexico disagreed profoundly with the Reagan administration's
military involvement in Central America. During that same period,
State Department officials were embittered by Mexico's efforts to
undercut American policy toward that region.
   With officials known more for pragmatism than ideological
militancy in charge now in both countries, the relationship between
the respective foreign ministries is better than at any time in
years.
   Still, disagreements remain. As an example, Mexico opposed U.S.
efforts in the Organization of American States this past summer for
decisive action against Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   In contrast to the U.S. policy of not recognizing Panama's
government, Mexico is one of the few Latin American countries which
still has an ambassador accredited in Panama.

<HEAD>Jury In Bakker Trial Could Get Case By End Of Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker returns to the stand for more
cross-examination at his fraud trial Monday, after a session last
week that even his defense lawyer says ``very devastating'' to his
case.
   Bakker, charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy related
to his handling of finances at the television ministry, testified
Friday that he never defrauded anyone or conspired with others at
PTL to commit fraud. He is expected to wind up his testimony Monday.
   The case probably will go to the jury late this week.
   George Davis, Bakker's lead defense attorney, didn't appear
confident that Bakker's testimony Friday had convinced the jury his
client is innocent.
   ``That was a pretty heavy cross-examination,'' the 82-year-old
Davis told the Greensboro News &amp; Record when asked how he thought
the questioning had gone. ``It was very damaging, very
devastating.''
   He smiled weakly and added, ``It didn't have anything to do with
the issues, but ... ''
   Several episodes during Friday's testimony indicated Bakker's
team may have been caught off-guard.
   In one instance, a defense chart was ruled inadmissible partly
because it summarized information not in evidence.
   In several other instances, Bakker claimed he had told viewers
on his television shows that some changes would be made in the PTL
lodging programs at issue in the charges against him.
   But he was unable to say when he made the announcements, even
though the defense has had access for several months to the same
PTL videotapes and program summaries that the government has.
   During three hours of cross-examination, Bakker answered ``I
don't remember'' or its equivalent more than three dozen times.
   During his initial testimony, Bakker said that when he left PTL
in March 1987, he had built, was building or had plans for
accommodations for more than 211,000 ``lifetime partners'' for PTL.
   Lifetime partnerships are the PTL lodging benefits at issue in
the fraud charges. PTL offered contributors free lodging at hotels
at PTL's Heritage USA retreat _ typically three nights each year
for life _ in exchange for contributions, typically $1,000.
   Bakker is accused of exceeding the announced limits on the
number of partnerships. He's also accused of diverting most of the
$158 million in proceeds from the announced purpose of construction
to PTL's general operating expenses, including about $3.7 million
in salary and bonuses for himself from 1984 to 1987.
   About 152,000 lifetime partnerships were sold between January
1984 and May 1987, including 66,000 in the Heritage Grand Hotel,
where Bakker had said only 25,000 would be sold, and 74,000 in the
still-unfinished Towers hotel, where Bakker had said only 30,000
would be sold.
   Bakker attempted to show jurors a summary chart of the various
hotels, lodges, bunkhouses, chalets and campsites he said could
have accommodated the 211,000 partners.
   But prosecutor Deborah Smith and fellow prosecutor Jerry Miller
kept the chart from being admitted into evidence.
   They argued that the chart summarized information that was not
in evidence. The defense had neither introduced its own evidence
that some of the facilities were to be built nor elicited that
testimony from witnesses.
   They also said it was misleading. Bakker said ``overflow'' from
the hotels could be housed in some of the other facilities, but
prosecutors pointed out that lifetime partners had been offered
their choice of lodging.
   Bakker's direct testimony, answering questions from his own
attorney, dealt largely with his career and with his vision for PTL.
   But he touched several times on the difficulty of raising enough
money to keep PTL going.
   ``You never, ever, ever get away from the pressure you have to
raise money for next week, next month, next year,'' he said.
   Bakker insisted that his lifetime partnership programs never
deceived his viewers, and that he never hid information from his
board of directors as the government has charged.
   He flatly accused one former employee _ former top aide David
Taggart _ of lying when Taggart testified that Bakker had him relay
instructions to divert Lifetime Partnership money to PTL's general
expenses.

   Two rockets struck central Kabul
Sunday, one exploding near the police headquarters, and hospital
officials reported the missiles killed at least 13 people and
wounded 24.
   The officials said most of the victims were standing in line at
a gasoline station, waiting to receive their daily fuel ration.
   Witnesses said Sunday was Police Day, honoring the police force,
and one rocket blew up in a downtown park near police headquarters.
The hospital officials did not know if any policemen were among the
casualties and the government made no comment on the attacks.
   The second rocket exploded near the Ministry of Mines and
Industry building in the large presidential compound.
   Many merchants on Chicken Street, the main shopping street lined
with carpet and antique stores, drew the shutters and closed their
businesses as ambulance crews removed the dead and wounded.
   Kabul has been the target of almost daily rocket attacks since
late June with anti-communist guerrillas stationed in the
surrounding hills firing the missiles into the city. The attacks
have killed more than 350 people and injured about 800.
   The Marxist government claims the rebels fire the rockets at
random into Kabul to spread panic among civilians and make them
flee to guerrilla-controlled areas.
   The rebels, who have been battling government forces for a
decade, have denied some of the rocket attacks and say the Kabul
government fires at its own people.
   Most of the rebel factions have bases across the border in
Pakistan and receive military aid from the United States, while the
Soviet Union backs the government.

<TEXT>
   Dozens of East Germans, including some who
missed a special train to West Germany hours earlier, arrived
Sunday at the West German Embassy in Warsaw hoping to follow their
compatriots to the West.
   Up to 100 new refugees sat glumly in cars or milled about the
street in front of the embassy.
   Several said they were certain there eventually would be another
``freedom train'' for them.
   Juerg Sachs of Schwerin, in northern East Germany, said he and
his wife, Daniela, arrived in Warsaw at 2 a.m. Sunday just before
the special train left. He said they were not able to reach the
embassy in time to catch the train that departed at 2:50 a.m.
   Sachs, 29, said he had been reassured by an official inside the
embassy compound who told him, ``You missed the train, but don't
worry, because there will be another solution in four to six
weeks.''
   ``Better six weeks in Warsaw than another six years in the
GDR,'' Sachs said, using the initials for the formal name of his
Communist homeland, the German Democratic Republic.
   About 800 East German refugees in Warsaw and 6,000 in Prague,
Czechoslovakia, were allowed to travel to West Germany in special
trains late Saturday and Sunday under terms of a historic East-West
accord.
   However, East Germany said it now expects West Germany to resume
``normal international customs'' at its embassies, indicating it
wants the Bonn government to bar refugees from its diplomatic
compounds.
   Poland's official PAP news agency said Sunday that East Germany
showed ``high flexibility and understanding for this human
dimension of the problems'' in allowing the exodus.
   Poland has a new government led by non-Communists, but it has
handled the refugee issue cuatiously, trying not to antagonize East
Germany, a Warsaw Pact ally.
   PAP's report Sunday said again that Poland had considered the
refugees a problem to be settled between the two Germanys. It said
it had only provided logistical and technical assistance to the
talks that led to the East-West accord.
   The agency said the issue should not ``lead to deteriorating ...
relations with either of the German states.''
   Poland took a more liberal approach toward the refugees than its
hard-line Communist neighbor, Czechoslovakia. Polish officials let
the refugees move freely around the city but in Prague they were
crowded into the embassy compound.
   A West German Embassy worker said Sunday that East Germany's
decision to let the refugees travel to the West would not
discourage more from coming to Poland.
   ``I think just the opposite,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

<TEXT>
   A federal investigation touched off by the
discovery of 20 tons of cocaine in a California warehouse has
turned up drug-trafficking links in Nevada, Texas and Mexico.
   Seven people were in custody in Los Angeles and Nevada in
connection with the haul _ the largest seizure in the world. Six
warehouses in El Paso, Texas, as well as three homes across the
border in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, were raided by police, who said
the facilities were used as stopovers by the suspected smugglers.
   ``We feel these warehouses were used as staging warehouses
before the cocaine was sent to Los Angeles,'' said U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration special agent Phil Jordan.
   Investigators said the cocaine entered the United States through
El Paso before ending up in a San Fernando Valley warehouse
operating as Adriana's Pottery Warehouse, where police and federal
drug authorities made the record seizure Thursday.
   The bust attracted so much attention that looters showed up at
the unguarded warehouse and began to remove its remaining contents
only hours after the cocaine was removed.
   DEA agents said they secured the building, but the looters
managed to gain entrance and snatch up Mexican pottery that was
part of the company's merchandise.
   No arrests were made, and police said nothing of evidentiary
value was taken.
   When drug enforcement agents across the country heard of the
bust, possible connections to the smugglers began emerging.
   One such link between the Los Angeles seizure and a house in
Juarez was confirmed when one of the Los Angeles suspects
telephoned the house from jail and a police officer there answered
the phone, Jordan said.
   No arrests were made, but a tractor and two trailers fitted with
secret compartments were seized outside the house. ``In one of
these compartments we found 500 pounds of marijuana,'' Jordan said.
   El Paso DEA agents also found boxes similar to those found in
the Los Angeles raid, along with Mexican pottery similar to that in
that warehouse.
   The four men being held in California have refused to give their
names, saying only that they are from Mexico, police said.
   Huntington Park police Sgt. Mike Leinen said the men were to be
arraigned Monday on state charges.
   The three men arrested Friday in Las Vegas were scheduled for
arraignment Monday in U.S. District Court in Nevada.

   The wedding present Linda Baldwin is
getting from the state lottery isn't just another coffee-maker.
   Ms. Baldwin, 31, of Braintree was one of three winners in
Saturday's Megabucks drawing. Her winning ticket will be good for
$1,065,960, or $53,298 each year before taxes, lottery spokesman
Dave Ellis said.
   The total jackpot was $3,197,880.
   ``This is really going to make a big difference in our lives,''
Ellis quoted Ms. Baldwin as saying. She is to be married next

   It was banned as bad taste in Marengo, but
organizers determined to let the chips fall where they may did just
that in a cow-pie contest complete with cheerleaders urging on the
bovine contestants.
   The idea of people wagering on the wanderings _ and droppings _
of a cow was too much for Marengo Mayor Richard Baker, who vetoed
plans to hold the contest in the northern Illinois town as a
fund-raiser for Marengo's annual Settlers' Days.
   Organizer Bob Begora was undaunted _ ``Every party has its
pooper,'' he said. So he got permission to hold the contest
Saturday at the Seven Acres Antique Village &amp; Museum, in nearby
Union.
   There were no party poopers at the contest, where about 250
people watched from bleachers as one cow at a time wandered a grid
marked off in 100 3-foot-by-3-foot squares, Begora said.
   ``You put the names (of the ticket-holders) on the square and if
the cow poops on your square you win $1,250,'' Begora said. ``On
the third drop it landed on a line, so we split the prize between
two ticket-holders.''
   Begora said 300 tickets were sold at $25 each, so three cows
were used for three separate contests. Some people bought tickets
from as far away as St. Louis because of the publicity generated
when the contest was banned in Marengo, Begora said.
   Six cheerleaders known as the ``Pooperettes'' exhorted the crowd
to encourage the cows, and the first dropping was accompanied by
the release of 150 homing pigeons and a band playing their version
of ``Hallelujah,'' Begora said.
   The cows were fed immediately before with a mixture designed to
act as a natural laxative.
   The contest raised $3,750 for Settlers' Days, and Begora said he
would like to hold the contest again next year.

   Thousands of East Germans received a
triumphal welcome in West Germany Sunday after their government
agreed to let them flee to the West. It was the latest chapter in a
historic exodus from a divided Soviet bloc.
   ``We made it, we made it!'' screamed one tearful young woman
after arriving in this northern Bavarian city at dawn.
   ``We had no future there,'' said 34-year-old Uwe Kuester of
Cottbus.
   About 6,000 refugees either arrived or were on their way from
Czechoslovakia, border police said, and another 800 arrived from
Poland.
   The refugees began gathering weeks ago in the West German
embassies in Warsaw and Prague after they were unable to reach
Hungary, a liberal Warsaw Pact nation that had opened its western
border to the East Germans last month.
   Many of those arriving wept with joy. Others cheered and clapped.
   In Prague and Warsaw, East Germans who heard of the exodus raced
to railroad stations, some arriving in time to jump on board the
trains. West German news reports and witnesses said more East
Germans were rushing in their cars toward Czechoslovakia and at
least 200 were once again filling the embassy in Prague.
   Up to 100 more East Germans assembled at the West German Embassy
in Warsaw on Sunday.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany
indicated in a television interview late Sunday that West Germany
was talking with East Germany about passage to the West for the new
refugees.
   ``Also in the future, we will use all our powers and
possibilities to help those (seeking refuge), as we have done in
the past and up until the last several hours,'' Genscher said in
the interview with the ZDF television network.
   Genscher later told ARD television he hoped for a ``parallel
solution'' for the latest East Germans at the embassy in Prague.
   The new arrivals follow the more than 24,000 East Germans who
have fled through Hungary since Sept. 10, when the reform-minded
Communist government in Budapest decided to open its border.
   Hard-line East Germany reluctantly agreed to the exodus and
trains began shuttling refugees from Prague late Saturday. Trains
from Poland arrived on Sunday.
   The East German government insisted the refugees from Prague and
Warsaw had been ``expelled.''
   On Sunday the East German Foreign Ministry accused West Germany
of ``damaging international norms'' by giving East Germans refuge
inside Bonn's embassies in Prague and Warsaw in the first place,
the government's ADN television reported.
   As part of the agreement with West Germany that was announced
Saturday night, the East Germans had to travel in state-run trains
back through their former Communist homeland as a face-saving
measure for the government.
   Czechoslovakia, also with a hard-line government, had vowed that
it would not allow the refugees to leave for the West from
Czechoslovakia.
   Still, the action represented an embarrassing retreat for the
aging leadership in East Berlin, which had severely criticized
Hungary's action.
   The once-unthinkable exodus of East Germans reflects dramatic
changes in the Soviet bloc and a growing disunity among its member
states.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the galvanizing force for
reforms sweeping much of Eastern Europe, will visit East Berlin
Friday and Saturday for celebrations of East Germany's 40th
anniversary.
   His talks with East German leader Erich Honecker are expected to
deal with the exodus, which has threatened the nation's already
demoralized work force.
   ``I hope that Gorbachev, during his talks with the leaders of
(East Germany) will try to convince them that political reforms are
also in the interest of the German Democratic Republic,'' said
Genscher.
   A high-ranking Soviet official was quoted by the West German Die
Welt newspaper as saying Moscow welcomed East Germany's decision to
allow the weekend exodus.
   Valentin Falin, head of the Soviet Central Committee's
international relations section, also said he believed Gorbachev
will travel to East Berlin with important messages for both German
governments, Die Welt said. There was no elaboration.
   East Berlin emphasized it expected the latest exodus to be a
one-time event, after which West Germany would return to ``normal
international customs'' at its embasssies.
   In Prague, police initially surrounded the West German embassy
to block newly arrived East Germans from scaling a spiked fence
into the muddy grounds. But the embassy later again began letting
East Germans back into the embassy.
   Bavarian border police spokesman Klaus Pappenfuss said six
trains were bringing the more than 6,000 refugees from Prague
during the course of the day.
   Well-wishers handed out bottles of wine, champagne and fruit as
the East Germans disembarked in Hof. Red Cross volunteers
distributed hot tea, noodle soup, baby food and diapers to the
refugee families.
   Several former East Germans, who had fled earlier to the West
from Hungary, carried a banner that read:
   ``We got out through Hungary and you made it through Prague.
Soon the zone (East Germany) will be an empty coffin.''
   Sven Mueller, a 27-year-old metal worker, said: ``It was strange
passing through East Germany on our way here, but we knew we were
all right because there were West German officials on board.''
   Many of the refugees quickly made their way to a bank of
telephone booths in the station in efforts to reach relatives in
East Germany.
   Most had little or no West German currency, and those who did
faced constant busy signals from East Germany's overtaxed telephone
circuits.
   Amid the crush on the platform, loud-speakers called out the
names of new arrivals who had relatives waiting for them.
   The East Germans were taken immediately to several refugee
processing centers and temporary shelters set up by border police
and the military, officials said.
   West German law automatically grants East Germans citizenship on
arrival. More than 100,000 East Germans have emigrated or fled to
West Germany this year.
   The have flooded to the West because of disillusionment with
political repression and economic stagnation in their homeland.
   Horst Waffenschmidt, a state secretary in the federal Interior
Ministry, said Bonn had not paid money to secure passage for the
refugees and was not asked to.

<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat arrived Sunday for his
first visit to Japan as a guest of the government, which is
expected to hear his views on prospects for peace in the Middle
East.
   During his four-day visit, Arafat is to meet with Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu, former Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, Foreign Minister
Taro Nakayama and leaders of the governing and opposition parties.
   Officials said the government will listen to Arafat's views on
the Middle East peace process, including recent proposals by
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on election procedures and
possibilities for direct dialogue between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Foreign Ministry officials said the government invitation was
intended to to show Japan's appreciation for Arafat's U.N. speech
in Geneva in December, when he renounced violence and laid out
ideas for peace.
   One official said the invitation was aimed at bolstering
Arafat's moderate policy amid reported pressures from PLO
hard-liners advocating a return to terrorist tactics.
   ``We have the view that Chairman Arafat has very limited time''
to bolster his position, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
   The government also invited Arafat as part of its own efforts to
help seek peace in the Middle East through contacts with both the
Arabs and Israelis, the official said.
   The government's invitation to Arafat was the first to a PLO
leader since the organization was founded in 1964.
   Officials have said the government was welcoming Arafat as
chairman of the PLO, not as president of the self-proclaimed state
of Palestine.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service, in a dispatch from Tunisia on
Saturday, quoted Arafat as saying he will urge Japan to recognize
the state of Palestine.
   Arafat previously visited Japan in October 1981 at the
invitation of the Arab-Japanese Parliamentarian League.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency reported Saturday that
Arafat will make an official visit to China on Wednesday and
Thursday.

   Soldiers shot and killed four Palestinians in
clashes in the occupied lands Sunday and Arab activists stabbed to
death a man they accused of collaborating with Israel, the army and
Arab hospitals said.
   In the Gaza Strip, Moslem fundamentalists issued a new leaflet
calling on Palestinians to escalate their 21-month-old uprising and
to ``continue to kill collaborators.''
   The 700,000 Arab residents of the seaside strip were banned from
entering Israel for a third consecutive day as Israelis celebrated
Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.
   The holiday ended at sundown Sunday, but the closure remains in
effect until Monday morning.
   Security was tight throughout Israel as Israelis attended prayer
services at synagogues or flocked to resort sites. In the occupied
Gaza Strip and West Bank, soldiers battled stone-throwing
Palestinian protesters, reportedly wounding 25 of the demonstrators.
   The most violent clash was reported at Gaza's Nuseirat refugee
camp, where troops shot and killed 17-year-old Nidal Saidam and
wounded at least 14 other Palestinians, including Saidam's sister
Ikram, 16, Arab doctors said. They said Saidam died of a gunshot
wound to the head.
   The army command confirmed the death and four wounded and said
it was checking further.
   At least four Palestinians were reported wounded in other
clashes in the Gaza Strip.
   In the Gaza village of Bani Suhaila, uprising activists armed
with daggers and clubs stabbed to death Saleh Al-Kera, 25, whom
they accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities, Arab
reporters said.
   The army confirmed the death, which raised to 123 the number of
alleged collaborators slain by Palestinians in the revolt.
   Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed 581 Palestinians
during the revolt, and 40 Israelis have been killed.
   ``Continue to kill collaborators,'' urged a leaflet distributed
Sunday in Gaza by Moslem extremists from the Islamic Jihad group.
   Some Palestinian notables have condemned the hasty slayings of
suspected collaborators.
   The leaflet also ordered two general strike days this month and
told Palestinian activists to keep confiscating Israeli-issued
magnetic identity cards required for Gazans to travel to Israel.
   Arab activists have confiscated about 10,000 of the 60,000 cards
issued by Israel as a security precaution. Last week, activists
began returning the cards in what was seen as a victory for
Israel's tighter security measures.
   Sunday's clashes spread to the West Bank, where three
Palestinians were shot and killed, according to Arab and military
accounts.
   Army officials said a military patrol was attacked by youths
hurling concrete blocks from rooftops at the marketplace in Nablus,
the West Bank's largest Palestinian city.
   They said soldiers opened fire when their lives were in danger,
wounding 17-year-old Immad Kharaz, who fell from the roof and died.
Arab reporters said his body was removed from a hospital and buried
in a funeral procession attended by more than 400 Palestinians.
   In the West Bank village of Arabe, troops fired plastic bullets
after being attacked with stones and bottles, killing a protester,
military officials said. Arab reporters identified the victim as
Khalil Abu Ziad, 16, and said he died instantly when several
bullets pierced his chest.
   At the Aida refugee camp near Bethlehem, soldiers arresting
three suspects were attacked by a mob, an army official said. He
said the soldiers shot to death one Palestinian and wounded three.
   In clashes in Nablus, Arabe and the West Bank's Balata refugee
camp, four other Palestinians were shot and wounded, Arab hospital
officials said. The army said it was checking the reports.

   Do you put on both socks and then both shoes,

   When visiting a friend's house and the shower curtain is closed,

   While the better-known pollsters are asking Americans their
political preferences or their thoughts on the great issues of the
world, a couple of New Yorkers are raising questions that inquiring
minds really want answered.
   ``We've always been compulsive, obsessive collectors of odd
tidbits of information. How many people wear torn underwear under
their expensive clothes? How many unmatched socks lie lonely in
dresser drawers?'' explain Mel Poretz and Barry Sinrod in their new
book.
   Under the modest title _ ``The First Really Important Survey of
American Habits'' _ Poretz and Sinrod have compiled the answers to
the questions that have been burning holes in their curiosity.
   They found, for example, that 19 percent of Americans put both
the sock and shoe on one foot first, then the other, as opposed to
the more common way: both socks and then both shoes.
   Men were slightly more likely to go ``sock-shoe, sock-shoe''
then women, they found.
   How do they know these things? They asked.
   More precisely, they polled a little over 2,000 people across
the country. Sinrod and Poretz, who are involved in marketing and
polling, say their survey represents the tastes and habits of 89
percent of Americans aged 21 and over. However, details like
margins of error that are popular with the more serious surveys
were not reported.
   ``All totals are statistically correct and can be verified,
trust us,'' Poretz and Sinrod say.
   After making that leap of faith, readers will learn that:
   _Only 7 percent of Americans admit looking behind a closed
shower curtain when visiting a friend's home and that such
surreptitious glances are much more common among women aged 21 and
34, of whom one-fourth say they look behind the curtain. The man
most likely to look is aged 45 to 54, they found, with one in 10
doing so.
   _37 percent of Americans never weigh themselves. Some 41 percent
of women and 37 percent of men said they never step on the scales.
About one in three checks weight weekly, while 14 percent do so
more that four times a week.
   _67 percent of Americans say they spend less time in the
bathroom than their mate does. The figure was the same for both
sexes.
   _38 percent of the people responding say they clean their belly
button every day; 20 percent say they never do so.
   _53 percent eat spaghetti by winding it on a fork and 47 percent
cut it.
   _80 percent eat corn on the cob by going around the ear in the
circle; 20 percent nibble from side-to-side, like a typewriter.
   _61 percent say they would wear torn underwear, 39 percent would
not. Men were slightly more willing to wear the torn item, 68
percent. Only 57 percent of the women said they would. There was
this further breakdown: 74 percent of white collar workers said
they would wear torn underwear, while only 48 percent of blue
collar workers would.

   A man who 35 years ago was among the
first to discover the remains of a shipwreck uncovered by Hurricane
Hazel has told officials of another shipwreck exposed by Hurricane
Hugo.
   Historians and residents on Saturday dug up wooden pulleys,
pieces of board and iron spikes along Myrtle Beach. They also found
a large piece of wood with iron sheeting attached that may have
been a part of the boat's stern.
   Among those digging was Jack Thompson, who was among the first
to find the wreckage of the Freda A. Wiley, a Boston lumber ship
bound for New Orleans, after Hazel swept through in 1954.
   ``I believe there were several ships in that flotilla, carrying
lumber from Boston to New Orleans, that were caught up in the storm
of 1898,'' Thompson said. ``This may be one of those lumber ships.''
   Thompson, a photographer and longtime Myrtle Beach resident,
found a pulley from the ship on the beach Friday and notified city
officials of the shipwreck.
   State officials were to arrive Monday to examine the shipwreck,
but until then, representatives of the Horry County Historical
Society and the Myrtle Beach Police reburied their finds.
   ``You can't just dig something up like that without treating it.
It starts rotting if it's exposed to air,'' said Ben Burroughs, a
past president of the Horry County Historical Society.

<HEAD>Foley Predicts Doom for Catastrophic Care</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: RECASTS top 13 grafs to move up Foley comments on catastrophic
health vote; picks up 14th graf pvs, ``On the''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley on Sunday
predicted the House this week probably will vote to repeal Medicare
catastrophic health care coverage that it enacted last year for
some 33 million elderly Americans.
   Many beneficiaries, especially the wealthier among them, have
balked at having to pay premiums this year of up to $800 to cover
the hospital and physicians' bills for lower-income retirees.
   ``I hope personally that the program is retained on a modified
form,'' Foley, D-Wash., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program.
``But ... there are a great number of Republicans and some
Democrats in the House who are in favor of repeal. If I were
guessing today, I think it probably would be repealed.''
   Foley also said he doubts that the reconciliation bill will be
completed by an Oct. 16 deadline. Broad across-the-board spending
cuts in both domestic and military programs will take effect
automatically then unless it is.
   ``We might have some few days in which there would be a
technical sequestration, that is an across-the-board cutting
through executive order of all the accounts,'' Foley said.
   However, he added, ``I don't think that's going to be a
permanent situation.''
   In other House action, a long-awaited bill to protect the
nation's waterways from oil spills is expected to get to the floor
this week after months of committee hearings and backroom
negotiations.
   Similar legislation already has passed the Senate. But the
version that emerged from a House committee was opposed by so many
members that the drafters renegotiated a new proposal that could be
sensibly managed on the floor.
   The Exxon-Valdez tanker accident last spring that dumped 10
million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound inspired the
congressional review of liability laws and legislation to
strengthen them.
   Though specifics weren't available last week, congressional
staffers and others with an interest in the House bill believe the
main sticking point _ pre-emption of state's rights to enact laws
stricter than federal statutes _ will have to be worked out by the
full House through floor votes.
   Other items such as limits on how much the federal government
can charge oil companies for spills are expected to be included in
the revised legislation before it goes to the floor Thursday.
   The House also will continue work this week on reducing the
federal deficit through the bill known as the Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1989.
   This week, members will decide whether to repeal catastrophic
medical insurance for retirees or to reduce benefits, and choose
between competing plans for increasing child-care assistance to
low-income families.
   On the Senate side, the Finance Committee begins work on a
package of spending reductions and revenue increases designed to
cut the budget deficit by about $17 billion this fiscal year.
   The biggest issue facing the panel is whether to reduce the tax
on capital gains, which President Bush recommended as a saving
incentive and temporary revenue-raising measure and the House
approved last week.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Sunday on the same
NBC program that he has the votes to defeat the House-passed
version of President Bush's capital gains measure.
   ``It is so bad, so wrong for the economy,'' he said. ``It will
do for the deficit what crack does for the user: a quick short high
followed by a long, painful depression.''
   Mitchell, however, said Bush's ``irresponsible position ...
makes it extremely difficult to prevent any tax cut from
occurring'' on a very close vote.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the finance panel, is
recommending a partial restoration of tax deductibility of
contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs, as an
alternative to the capital gains cuts.
   Meanwhile, conference committees will be continue on several
appropriations bills telling each department how much and where it
can spend money.
   Last week, there was a negotiating session between House and
Senate conferees thrashing out the defense authorization bill _ one
of the stickiest in the package.
   A major sticking point is how much the government will spend on
Star Wars in fiscal 1990: The Senate has appropriated $3.7 billion
but the House wants to spend only $3.1 billion.
   The House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and
housing continues its investigation into scandals at the Department
of Housing and Urban Development with a return appearance by
self-described influence peddler Paul Manafort.
   Stonewalled by the leading players in the scandal, the
subcommittee wants to job Manafort's memory about projects linked
to him by other witnesses since his first appearance in June.
   Back then, Manafort acknowledged that he used his influence
among political appointees at HUD to steer millions of dollars in
government renovation funds to a housing project in which he shared
ownership.
   However, he his Alexandria, Va., firm of Black, Manafort, Stone
&amp; Kelly did relatively little HUD business. Since then, other
witnesses have connected the firm with projects in New Jersey,
Connecticut, Georgia and Puerto Rico.

   Nicaraguans began registering Sunday
to vote in February's national elections as American congressmen
and other observers watched for evidence of fraud.
   Nearly 5,000 booths nationwide were opened to register the
estimated 1.9 million voters.
   President Daniel Ortega was the first in line at the booth
serving his area, an upper-class neighborhood in central Managua.
Dressed in his military uniform, Ortega arrived with his wife,
Rosario Murillo, and several of their children.
   Speaking to reporters, Ortega called on all Nicaraguans to
register ``so there will be massive participation'' in the
balloting Feb. 25 for president, vice president, a new legislature
and mayors.
   Ortega advanced the date of 1991 elections as part of a peace
accord he and four other Central American presidents signed in
August. He pledged opposition candidates could campaign without
harassment and with a free press, and that the balloting would be
fair.
   As part of the pact, the five presidents agreed to disband the
U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, by Dec. 8. Most of the
Contras are based across the border in Honduras.
   In a news release the Defense Ministry said a group of rebels
attacked a military patrol about 110 miles north of Managua
Saturday. The release, issued Sunday, said one soldier and two
Contras were killed in the gunbattle.
   Ortega and Vice President Sergio Ramirez are seeking re-election
on the ticket of the ruling leftist Sandinista National Liberation
Front. Both were elected in 1984.
   There were some irregularities at Ortega's booth Sunday: It
opened an hour late at 8 a.m., the representative of the National
Opposition Union coalition on the board did not show up and his
deputy arrived without any identification. The deputy was sent home
to get it but hours later had not returned.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, presidential candidate of the
opposition alliance and publisher of the newsaper La Prensa,
registered at a booth in her neighborhood after attending Mass.
   Joao Baena Soares, general secretary of the Organization of
American States, a team from the United Nations and four U.S.
congressmen were among the foreigners observing the registration
process.
   ``I see that people are motivated, and that there's a great
interest in registering,'' Baena told reporters after visiting 11
registration booths in Leon, 56 miles northwest of Managua and
Nicaragua's second largest city.
   Rep. David Drier, R-Calif., Howard Coble, R-N.C., Cass Balenger,
R-N.C., and Porter Goss, R-Fla., were among those visiting the
booths.
   Heavy rain in most of the country made many roads muddy, making
access to the booths difficult in rural areas.
   In the 1984 elections, Ortega showed up to register without any
identification. To everyone's amusement, he had to ask two people
to certify his identity.
   The United States supports the opposition and backs Nicaraguan
rebels trying to overthrow the leftist government.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 7 inches of rain fell Sunday over parts of the Southeast,
causing lowland flooding and prompting widespread flash flood
watches, and snow fell in parts of Montana.
   In the southern Georgia town of Moultrie, a tornado killed a
woman and an infant, injured a dozen more people and destroyed a
church in a 10-mile rampage Sunday afternoon.
   Rising water forced evacuation of more than 50 people from one
North Carolina mobile home park.
   Flash flood watches were posted into early Monday morning over
southeastern West Virginia, western Virginia, western North
Carolina, western South Carolina and northern Georgia.
   Two inches of rain or more fell Saturday and Sunday over western
sections of the Carolinas and northern Georgia, as well as across
the western Florida Panhandle.
   Athens, Ga., got 7.64 inches of rain during the 24 hours up to
noon EDT.
   Record flooding was predicted on the Oconee River at Penfield,
Ga. Flood stage is 11 feet and the river reached 19.7 feet Sunday,
with a crest of about 24 feet forecast Monday, the National Weather
Service said.
   Authorities in Gaston County, N.C., evacuated 53 residents of 30
mobile homes in a low-lying park, said Tom Riley, Gaston County
communications coordinator. Lincoln County authorities helped
evacuate residents of a house threatened by a nearby overflowing
creek, said Bill Hoover, a dispatcher with the Lincoln County
Sheriff's Department.
   ``We have just urged caution. It's probably as bad as it's going
to get,'' said a dispatcher in Polk County, N.C., where three low
bridges were covered by water.
   Rain began falling in western North Carolina late Thursday ``and
it's been raining since,'' said Hank Moore of the weather service
in Asheville. He said 2 to 7 inches had fallen in some areas.
   ``We're saturated not only from (hurricane) Hugo, but from
rainfall earlier in the month,'' Moore said.
   A few back roads in south-central Tennessee were closed by
water, the weather service said.
   Creeks in Pulaski County, Va., were nearly full and there was
minor flooding along Back Creek, the weather service said, but rain
stopped during the morning and no serious flooding was expected
there.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
2.41 inches at Ozark, Ala.; 2.0 at Athens, Ga.; 1.88 at Greer,
S.C.; 1.46 at Macon, Ga.; 1.43 at Huntsville, Ala.; 1.42 at
Hickory, N.C.; 1.38 at Dothan, Ala.; 1.30 at Atlanta; 1.24 at
Marietta, Ga.; 1.23 at Panama City, Fla.; 1.15 at Anniston, Ala.;
and 1.02 at Charlotte, N.C.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended northward into southern
Pennsylvania, central Ohio, Kentucky and southern Illinois.
   Elsewhere, showers reached from South Dakota across northern
Wyoming into south-central Montana, with snow at higher elevations
of Montana near Lewiston.
   A cold front in the Rockies kicked up wind gusting to 71 mph at
Boulder, Colo.
   Livestock advisories were posted over northern Wyoming because
of a combination of cold, gusty wind and rain changing to snow,
with accumulations of up to 5 inches predicted in the Big Horn
Mountains of north-central Wyoming.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., to 95 at Phoenix. Sunday's low for the
Lower 48 states was 24 at Gunnison, Colo., and Union Village, Vt.

<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's governing party on
Sunday offered to dissolve Parliament and hold new elections if
that would help restore peace to this nation crippled by ethnic
violence.
   The United National Party issued a statement saying a party
committee had made the recommendations in a report to President
Ranasinghe Premadasa. There was no immediate response from the
president.
   Sri Lanka, an island off the southern coast of India, is torn by
a separatist war with minority Tamils and a violent backlash by
majority Sinhalese. More than 11,000 people have been killed since
the Tamil insurgency started in 1983, and 5,000 others have been
killed in the Sinhalese violence.
   In another political development Sunday, the most powerful of
the Tamil rebel groups, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, said
it was willing to participate in elections in northeastern Sri
Lanka if the present provincial council was dissolved and Indian
peacekeeping troops return home.
   The government has been trying to have the 42,000 Indian
soldiers withdrawn and to increase Tamil autonomy in the northeast.
India sent troops into Sri Lanka under an India-brokered peace
accord between the Sinhalese and Tamils that collapsed. India has
promised to withdraw all of its troops by the end of the year.
   The governing party's statement also said its committee had
recommended the lifting of emergency regulations, suspension of the
anti-terrorist act, granting of amnesty to all political prisoners,
and offering protection to Sinhalese militants willing to put down
their weapons.
   The Sinhalese-dominated government declared a unilateral
cease-fire Wednesday in the struggle with militant Sinhalese.
However, government sources said it would not be extended beyond
Tuesday unless the radicals make a positive response.
   The government has asked them to renounce their violence. The
militatns say they are fighting because the government offered too
many concessions to the Tamils.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus living in northeastern Sri
Lanka, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population of 16 million.
They claim the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who account for 75
percent of the population, discriminate against them.
   A senior military official said Sunday that at least 28 people,
including three Buddhist monks, had been killed in the Sinhalese
violence during the cease-fire.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 789
Sinhalese militants had surrendered during the same period.

   A tornado destroyed a trailer park and a
church in a 10-mile rampage Sunday afternoon, killing a woman and a
toddler and injuring a dozen more people.
   Most of the damage and both deaths occurred at a mobile home
park five miles out of Moultrie in southern Georgia, Colquitt
County Sheriff Billy Howell. At least nine mobile homes were
destroyed.
   Twelve injured were brought to the county Regional Medical
Center, said Dave Nethers, public relations director. One was taken
to surgery and another to the intensive care unit and the other 10
did not appear to be that seriously hurt, he said. Five were
treated and released.
   The dead were identified as Joyce Carter, 45, and Brittany
Thomas, 2, both trailer park residents.
   The tornado tore through a stand of timber after wrecking the
mobile homes and then demolished the Bethlehem Schley Baptist
Church, police said. About 500 yards further it destroyed the
social hall at Schley Baptist and ripped the roof off the sanctuary.
   Bobby Cobb, who operates Cobb Funeral Home, said he saw the
twister coming. He said it appeared to split and pass on both sides
of his business before hitting the trailer park.
   A double-wide mobile home and a metal shop were the only
buildings left standing in the trailer park, which was strewn with
fragments of buildings and overturned automobiles.
   Moultrie Police Chief Richard Crouch said a command post was
being set up at the trailer park for the night and an emergency
shelter was being prepared at the Moultrie city gymnasium.
   The twister was part of a storm system that dropped up to 7
inches of rain fell Sunday over parts of the Southeast, causing
lowland flooding and prompted widespread flash flood watches.

<DATELINE>DUESSELDORF, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ultrarightist Republican
Party, led by a former Nazi SS trooper, won its first city council
seats Sunday in Cologne and several other West German cities,
according to television reports.
   Throngs of demonstrators, some of them carrying signs reading
``Nazis Out!'' held protest rallies against the Republicans in a
number of cities during municipal elections across North
Rhine-Westphalia state.
   The Republicans won their first council seats in Cologne,
Leverkusen, Dortmund, Duesseldorf, Gelsenkirchen, Hamm and Hagen,
according to projections by the ARD television network Sunday night.
   It said the party was expected to get between 6.2 percent and
7.4 percent of the vote in those cities. Five percent is required
for a party to win representation on a council.
   ARD said the Republicans were failing to get 5 percent of the
vote in many other cities and towns.
   The balloting was for governing councils in cities, districts,
towns and villages across densely populated North Rhine-Westphalia.
   ARD said Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union was
suffering serious losses and the Social Democrats, the opposition
party in the federal government, were picking up some votes.
   According to ARD's projections, the Christian Democrats would
receive 37.7 percent of the vote throughout the sate, down 4.5
percent from municipal elections five years ago. The Social
Democrats, who hold power in many of the largest cities, were
expected to win 43 percent of the vote, up by .5 percent.
   The Republicans entered the North Rhine-Westphalia municipal
elections following successes earlier this year.
   In balloting for the European Parliament elections last June the
party received 7.1 percent of the West German vote and gained six
seats in the Parliament.
   The Republicans won seats in the West Berlin state legislature
in January and also made gains in June municipal elections in the
states of Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate.
   The Republicans advocate ultraconservative and nationalist
policies but deny accusations that they are neo-Nazis. They argue
that new generations of Germans should be absolved of the guilt for
Nazi crimes.
   Franz Schoenhuber, the Republicans' national leader, was a
Waffen SS soldier in World War II.

   A South African group with close ties to that
country's governing National Party met in England Sunday with
members of the African National Congress, a news agency reported.
   The Afrikaner Broederbond and ANC members met near London for
talks expected to last about two days, according to Press
Association, Britain's domestic news agency.
   No details were given on the topics of their discussions.
   A Foreign Office spokesman in London said: ``We are aware of the
meeting. But it is not being organized by the British government.
We have no information about the nature of the talks.''
   Afrikaner Broederbond is headed by Wimpie de Klerk, a brother of
South Africa's news President F.W. de Klerk. The organization
consists of prominent figures believed to be close to senior
government ministers, Press Association said.
   The agency said Thabo Mbeki, ANC information officer, was
leading the delegation of the outlawed black nationalist
organization.
   The ANC has dismissed President de Klerk's pledges of
black-white power-sharing and vowed to continue its fight against
South Africa's white minority government.
   The ANC formed an exile headquarters in Zambia and began a
campaign of sabotage against South Africa and its racial separation
policies in 1961. It was banned in South Africa the previous year.

   A single-engine plane being flown by a

   James R. Grunzke, 41, of Beaver Falls, was pronounced dead at
the scene, about one mile from the Beaver County Airport, by Beaver
County Coroner Wayne Tatalovich. Police said Grunzke was carrying
documents that identified him as a USAir captain.
   Grunzke had been with the airline for 11 years and usually flew
DC-9s, said USAir spokeswoman Susan Young.
   The private plane, described as a 42-year-old two-seater with a
wingspan estimated at 30 feet, was making its final approach to
land when the accident happened about 11:45 a.m. Saturday, said
airport manager Dan Donatella.
   ``It apparently was structural failure,'' said Jack Mintier,
assistant police chief. ``Eyewitnesses said one of the wings just
folded back and the plane went straight down.''
   There were no passengers.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the crash.

   ``Anything But Love,'' which was in a 9 p.m. slot, will be
broadcast at 9:30 p.m. beginning Wednesday. ``Doogie Howser, M.D.''
will move to 9 p.m.
   ``We are pleased with the performance of both shows so far this
season,'' said Robert A. Iger, president of ABC Entertainment.
   ``However, we want to take advantage of the inherent younger
appeal of `Doogie Howser,' while maximizing `Anything But Love's'
excellent adult appeal in the 9:30 p.m. time period,'' Iger said.
   ``Anything But Love,'' stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis
as colleagues at a Chicago magazine. It premiered Sept. 27.

   The former chief justice of the Kansas
Supreme Court committed suicide by shooting himself in the head,
authorities said.
   Harold R. Fatzer, 79, was found Saturday at his Topeka home.
W.W. Scamman, Shawnee County district coroner, ruled the death a
suicide after an autopsy.
   Scamman said Fatzer apparently did not leave a note, but that he
had been depressed for medical reasons.
   ``He had been ill,'' Scamman said. ``He had several things I
think, some heart disease and probably a malignancy in his lung.''
   Fatzer, who served on the Kansas Supreme Court from 1956 to 1977
and was chief justice from 1971 to 1977, also served as the state
attorney general from 1949 to 1954, when he became well-known for
gambling raids he led.
   He had been appointed to preside this week over a Kansas Court
of Appeals panel thatwill hear a case in the courtroom named for
him in the Kansas Judicial Center.
   The Fatzer room was dedicated June 23 in recognition of Fatzer's
efforts in the early 1970s to persuade the Legislature to build the
center, which houses the state Law Library, Supreme Court, Court of
Appeals and attorney general's offices.
   Fatzer is survived by his wife, Frances, a sister, a son and
three grandsons.

   The Midwest is shaking its ``rust belt'' image
and should be promoted as a region with hard workers, a healthy
economy and less crime, participants in the Midwestern Governors'
Conference said Sunday.
   ``What we're trying to do is promote this region,'' Wisconsin
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said as governors and other representatives
of 13 states gathered for the start of the 27th annual conference,
which continues through Tuesday.
   Thompson, the conference host, said news media have dismissed
the Midwest as part of the ``rust belt,'' referring to the loss of
traditional manufacturing jobs when industries leave a region. But
he said the Midwest has begun to shake that image.
   Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa agreed, citing a recent article
in Newsweek magazine.
   ``The heartland is hot,'' he said. ``I think this region is in a
very enviable position.''
   Branstad said the area must market its strong work ethic,
healthy economy, educational programs, low cost of living and
relatively low crime rate.
   Speakers scheduled to appear at the conference include U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger.
   During business sessions of the conference, Thompson said the
governors would work to develop cooperative efforts to fight
illegal drugs and to protect the environment.
   Also, governors of the five states of the northern Mississippi
River will sign a Mississippi Pact to protect the river, which
Thompson called an environmental and economic resource.
   The states in the Midwestern Governors' Association are
Wisconsin, Missouri, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, North Dakota, South
Dakota, Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Nebraska.

   A police task force trying to suppress gang
violence arrested more than 1,000 people during weekend sweeps of
gang territories in Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley,
authorities said Sunday.
   Hundreds of officers were deployed in both areas Friday night
and again Saturday night, watching for any offenses and checking
for warrants.
   Police made 472 arrests Friday night and 624 arrest Saturday
night. Of the total, 345 were suspected gang members, police said.
   Gang attacks continued despite the sweeps, the latest in a
long-running series of sweeps that Police Chief Daryl Gates calls
Operation Hammer.
   A 15-year-old boy, Nelson R. Alas, an alleged gang member, was
shot and killed early Sunday in Hollywood, said Detective Bill
Humphry. Alas and another youth were on a bicycle when they were
confronted by a gang.
   Words were exchanged before the unidentified gang members shot
Alas to death, Humphry said. The other youth was not hurt.
   A spate of drive-by shootings, a typical method of gang attack,
killed one man and wounded seven people in greater Los Angeles
between Friday evening and early Saturday morning.

   Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former opposition
candidate for vice president, and eight supporters were arrested
Sunday by the Panamanian police, an opposition coalition said.
   The Civic Democratic Opposition Alliance said in a news release
that Arias and eight other members of his Christian Democratic
Party were arrested while they toured the countryside campaigning
for the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country's
military chief who controls the government.
   ADOC, as the opposition coalition is known by its Spanish
initials, said the nine were arrested in the western province of
Veraguas on orders of the provincial attorney general for alleged
subversive activities.
   ``We have received news indicating that Dr. Arias Calderon will
be indicted during the night on charges of inciting civil
disobedience, subversive activities and public disorder, as well as
acting against the economic integrity of the state,'' the news
release said.
   It was signed by Guillermo Cochez and Arellano Lennox, two
Christian Democratic Party leaders. The party is a member of ADOC.
   Arias Calderon ran as one of two opposition vice presidential
candidates in the May 7 national elections on a ticket led by
presidential candidate Guillermo Endara. The government annulled
the returns, which showed the opposition winning by a landslide.
   A spokesman at the Defense Forces in Panama City said Sunday he
had no information on the arrests, and so did another military
official in Veraguas.
   ``Up to now, we know nothing about that. We have no
information,'' said the duty officer at the Veraguas military
barracks, about 190 miles west of Panama City.
   No one answered the telephone at the Veraguas attorney general's
office.
   In a separate statement, Endara called Arias' arrest ``another
symptom of despair by the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega to repress the last vestiges of freedom and democracy that
remain in Panama.''
   ADOC, led by Endara, is mounting a campaign urging people to
delay paying taxes and utility bills to put economic pressure on
the Noriega regime. The opposition is also telling people not to
play the lottery or gamble in casinos.
   Both the lottery and the casinos, along with most of the
country's utilities, are government-owned. The Noriega-dominated
government has been depending heavily on them for money.
   The government has been short of funds since the United States
imposed trade and other economic sanctions on Panama soon after
federal courts in Florida indicted Noriega on drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges in 1988.
   Endara was on the 12th day of a hunger strike Sunday in Panama
City as part of the anti-Noriega campaign.
   He, Arias Calderon, and his other running mate Guillermo Ford
have demanded the government respect the results of the May
elections.
   The United States refuses to recognize the Noriega-dominated
government. It considers Endara and running mates as the legitimate
leaders.
   Noriega has named his longtime friend, Francisco Rodriguez, as
provisional president.

   Police went to Ecuador Sunday to bring
back a top drug-trafficking suspect and the army raided a home of
another cocaine kingpin, seizing guns and cash stuffed in burlap
bags, newspapers reported.
   In Lago Agrio, Ecuador, the government said suspected drug
dealer Evaristo Porras Ardila was sent back to Colombia Sunday.
   Ecuadorean Interior Minister Andres Vallejo told a midday news
conference in Lago Agrio, 112 miles northeast of Quito, that Porras
``will be sent to Colombia within the next hours.'' He said Porras
would be sent to the Ecuadorean-Colombian border and turned over to
Colombian authorities.
   Later the Ecuadorean government announced that Porras had been
delivered to Colombian police but it did not say when or where.
   Porras was arrested in Quito, Ecuador's capital, last Wednesday,
according to the government report. It said he had been in Ecuador
using a false name since 1987 and was president of Ecuamer, an
import-export enterprise.
   Colombian authorities rank Porras as No. 8 on their list of
most-wanted drug traffickers in their 6-week-old war on the
nation's cocaine cartels.
   The United States has a list of 80 Colombians it wants
extradited to face drug charges, but it has dislcosed the names of
only the top 12 and Porras is not among them.
   The Bogota daily El Tiempo reported Sunday that four detectives
had been sent to bring Porras back to Colombia.
   Another Bogota daily, El Espectador, quoted an unidentified
police official as saying 500 officers and soldiers tried to
capture another major trafficking suspect in a raid Saturday about
50 miles north of the capital.
   Two helicopters flew away from the suspected hideout of Jose
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha as the army and police closed in, the
newspaper said.
   Rodriguez Gacha is on the U.S. Justice Department's top 12 list.
None of the 12 has been captured.
   The Justice Department says Rodriguez Gacha, 42, is a leading
figure in the Medellin cocaine cartel, named after Colombia's
second-largest city, where it has headquarters.
   He allegedly traffics in cocaine and marijuana and heads an
international cocaine production and distribution organization
based in Bogota that is believed responsible for sending hundreds
of pounds of cocaine to the United States each week.
   Rodriguez Gacha faces drug-trafficking, conspiracy and
racketeering charges in six indictments in Florida and New York.
   Saturday's raid was near the town of Pacho, where army troops
last month seized 18 ranches belonging to Rodriguez, El Espectador
said.
   On Saturday, security forces confiscated $196,000 worth of pesos
stuffed into burlap bags and about 40 guns, El Espectador quoted
the police official as saying.
   President Virgilio Barco began the crackdown on the drug lords
Aug. 19 and revived an extradition treaty with the United States,
the destination of up to 80 percent of Colombia's cocaine.
   So far one suspect has been extradited and proceedings are under
way against a second.
   The drug lords have declared war on the government and
authorities have blamed almost daily bombings in Colombia's largest
cities on the traffickers.
   In the last month there have been 127 explosions; 10 people have
been killed and 148 injured.
   Two more bombs exploded Saturday night in Bogota, one just four
blocks from the presidential palace and the other at a school.
Police said there were no injuries.
   The bomb near the palace destroyed a national police station
that was under construction, police said. The other blast was the
sixth at a school in the past week.

   Walter A. O'Meara, chief of planning for the
Office of Strategic Services during World War II and media director
for Adlai Stevenson's 1952 presidential campaign, has died at age
92.
   O'Meara died Friday in Cohasset, Mass., said his daughter, Ellen
Woolf.
   Born in Minneapolis, O'Meara left an advertising career in 1950
to write novels and non-fiction.
   His best-known books include ``Grand Portage,'' a novel based on
the life of fur trader Daniel Harmon, and ``Minnesota Gothic,'' a
mystery novel about a family living in an old Victorian house.
   O' Meara first book, ``The Trees Went Forth,'' told the story of
a young man spending a year in a northern Minnesota logging camp.
Minnesota was the setting for roughly half of his 16 books.
   O' Meara attended the University of Minnesota before serving in
the U.S. Army during World War II. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from
the University of Wisconsin at Madison with a journalism degree in
1920.
   During World War II, he oversaw planning for the OSS, the
predecessor of the CIA, and was head of the information department
for the Office of Price Administration. He handled press relations
for Adlai Stevenson's losing 1952 presidential campaign.
   After working at the Duluth News Tribune for several years,
O'Meara joined the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in
Chicago. He later worked for Benton and Bowles advertising in New
York City.

   Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified 26
Spaniards who were killed during anti-church violence at the
outbreak of the Spanish civil war in 1936.
   The Spaniards and three other church figures were beatified at
an outdoor Mass in St. Peter Square attended by about 30,000
people. Anglican leader Robert Runcie, the archbishop of
Canterbury, also took part.
   Speaking of the Spaniards, the pontiff said none was ``entangled
in political questions.''
   ``But nevertheless in the climate of the historical moment in
which they lived, they were dragged out into the storm of religious
persecution,'' he said, speaking in Spanish.
   The Spaniards were killed in mid-1936 at the beginning of the
war when the church in Spain suffered a wave of violence and hate.
   The others beatified Sunday were three 19th-century figures:
Geltrude Caterina Comensoli, an Italian woman who founded a
religious order; Francesca Anna Cirer, a Spanish woman who founded
a convent, and the Rev. Lorenzo Salvi, an Italian priest.
   In the Roman Catholic Church, beatification is one step away
from possible sainthood.
   Twelve of the Spanish martyrs were killed at Manzanares,
including the Rev. Vincente Diez Tejerina, the Rev. Anatolio Garcia
Nozal, and the Rev. Justiniano Cuesta Redondo.
   Among the nine killed at Carabanchel Bajo were the Rev. Manuel
Perez Jimenez and the Rev. Felipe Valcabado Granado.
   Three were slain in Urda, including the Rev. Pedro Largob
Redondo, and two were killed in Carrion de Calatrava.
   Many of the victims were students.

   Manuel J. Clouthier, the conservative
National Action Party's candidate in the 1988 presidential
election, and a political colleague were killed Sunday in an
auto-truck accident, police reported.
   In last year's balloting, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the
candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, won
the presidency with slightly more than 50 percent of the vote.
Clouthier placed third with 17 percent.
   Clouthier, a wealthy businessman, was 55. He was on the campaign
trail again for his party in northern Mexico when he perished.
   A police report said Clouthier and Javier Calvo Manriquez,
National Action's Sinaloa state party chairman, were killed in a
head-on collision with a truck on the highway between Culiacan and
Mazatlan in Sinaloa, Clouthier's home state.
   It said Calvo Manriquez was driving the 1986 Dodge Dart.
   ``It happened around 11:30 a.m. .... They both died almost
instantly,'' Joel Cortes Escutia, a highway police duty officer at
the state capital of Culiacan, said in a telephone interview.
   Silvino Silva, editor of the newspaper Noroeste in Culiacan,
said the two men ``were on their way to Mazatlan to meet with
Ernesto Ruffo (governor-elect of Baja California).'' They had
scheduled a campaign rally for Sunday afternoon.
   Although Clouthier's third-place finish in 1988 had been
disappointing for National Action, his party made history with
Ruffo's July 2 win in Baja California.
   Ruffo will become the first opposition state governor in Mexico
in six decades when he is installed in office on Nov. 1.
   Clouthier and Ruffo were campaigning in Sinaloa for their
party's candidates in races for 18 city mayors Oct. 15.
   The government news agency Notimex quoted human rights activist
Rosario Ibarra de Piedra as saying Clouthier's death ``represents a
great loss for the political fight in Mexico.''
   Interior Secretary Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, the government's
chief political officer, sent condolences to Clouthier's family and
to National Action.
   Leftist leader Heberto Castillo called Clouthier's death ``a
hard blow for democratic pluralism.''
   ``He was a strong, courageous man of very defined political
ideology,'' Castillo told reporters.
   Carles Abedrop Avila, a former president of the Mexican Bankers'
Association, called Clouthier ``a great businessman and leader, an
honest and sincere fighter.''
   After his defeat in 1988, Clouthier continued to campaign
against election fraud, which he said has kept the Institutional
Revolutionary Party in power since 1929. At one point, Clouthier
staged a hunger strike at a major highway intersection in downtown
Mexico City.
   In the 1988 balloting, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a breakaway member
of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, came in second at the
head of a leftist coalition with 31 percent of the vote.
   After the returns were announced, Clouthier toured the country,
demanding the results be annulled and saying the election had been
``filthy.''
   ``Anyone who has a speck of decency, and I refer to Carlos
Salinas de Gortari in case he has any, can't shout victory in the
dirt that passed for elections,'' Clouthier said.
   Friends said Clouthier became active politically after President
Jose Lopez Portillo's government expropriated private Mexican banks
in 1982.
   One friend quoted him as saying, ``Lopez Portillo turned me into
a politician when he did that. I saw the power and the rigidity of
the presidential system and I decided to struggle to change that.''
   Clouthier ran for Sinaloa governor in 1986 but lost to the
Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate.
   In the 1988 presidential campaign, Clouthier advocated free
enterprise and an end to state controls over the economy and
denounced corruption and vote fraud.
   In the following years, he worked to unify his fractious
National Action Party into a political force and rally Mexico's
splintered conservatives.
   An agricultural engineer who at one time taught biology at the
University of Sinaloa, Clouthier sold most of his investments in
industrial companies and dedicated himself to truck farming and
politics.
   Clouthier was born June 13, 1934, in Culiacan.
   He was a fan of American football, which he played in high
school and for six years in a football league. He graduated from
the Technological Institute of Monterrey and was a leader of the
Mexican Employers' Federation council for more than 10 years.
   He is survived by his widow, Leticia Carrillo de Clouthier, and
10 children. The youngest are twins, a boy and a girl 15 years old.

<HEAD>Homeland Leader Offers Referendum on Rejoining South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUMBANE, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a nominally
independent black homeland told a crowd of 15,000 people at a
funeral service Sunday that if they want a referendum on rejoining
South Africa he will arrange it.
   Maj. Gen. Bantu Holomisa, who took power in the Xhosa homeland
of Transkei in a bloodless coup in December 1988, addressed the
crowd during the funeral for a Thembu clan chief, King Sabata
Dalindyebo, who opposed the territory being declared independent in
1976.
   Dalindyebo, a relative of African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, died in Lusaka, Zambia, in 1986 and his body was
sent home for burial. But the homeland leaders, fearing
demonstrations of support, buried the body in a commoner's
graveyard.
   The body was exhumed last week for reburial in the chief's
cemetery.
   Transkei is one of four black homelands South African's
white-dominated government has declared independent, but they are
not recognized by any other country. Most black South Africans
oppose the homeland system because it deprives the residents of
South African citizenship, residence, work and pension rights.
   There were anti-Holomisa chants among the crowd before the
33-year-old military officer took the stage with major South
African anti-apartheid figures such as Mandela's wife, Winnie.
   But by the end of Holomisa's speech, delivered in the Xhosa
language, many people were shouting ``Amandla!'' which means
``power.''
   Holomisa said if the people of Transkei wanted a referendum on
rejoining South Africa, he would organize it. He did not specify in
his short speech how the people would make their desire known and
there is no indication the South African government would accept
such a decision.
   Holomisa said he had allowed the exhumation and reburial of
Dalindyebo's remains ``because the people wanted it.''
   Dalindyebo was the traditional leader of Thembuland, which
covers most of Transkei. He was forced out of office by his cousin,
Kaiser Matanzima, in 1975 and fled to Lusaka, where he joined the
ANC.
   The South African government supported Matanzima because he had
agreed to Transkei becoming the first independent homeland as part
of the apartheid policy of creating separate nations for each black
tribe.

   A quarrel during a deacons' meeting at a church
erupted in gunfire that left two men dead and another wounded
Sunday, police said.
   The shooting occurred shortly before 1:30 p.m. during a meeting
among the four deacons and a secretary at the Living Testimony
Baptist Church in Dallas, said Sgt. Jim Chandler. The secretary was
not injured.
   ``All we know right now is that it appears that there was a
dispute among deacons. We're not sure what the argument was
about,'' said Detective H.E. Johnson.
   Two counts of capital murder and one count of attempted murder
were filed against one of the deacons, Gerald King, 30, who
remained at large Sunday, Chandler said.
   Jack Earl Ray, 51, died at Methodist Medical Center and Artis
Weaver, 60, died at Parkland Memorial Hospital, both from gunshot
wounds to the chest, authorities said.
   Billy Weaver, 39, was in fair condition at a local hospital with
a gunshot wound to the lower back, officials said.
   The shooting occurred in the church finance room _ where
donations are usually counted _ shortly after services ended,
according to police and witnesses. Several church members were
inside or just outside the church.
   About five minutes after the meeting commenced, witnesses said
they heard shouting from the church, followed by a series of
gunshots.
   ``They just started running and screaming, `He shot them,'''
Alvetta Taylor, a Sunday school teacher and longtime church member,
told The Dallas Morning News.
   King fled from the church in a car with his wife, Ms. Taylor
said.
   ``When he came out, his wife asked him what was wrong,'' she
said. ``She threw him into the car and drove off.''
   King was believed armed with a medium-caliber revolver, Chandler
said, and police also were searching for his wife.

   George Burns and Bob Hope added their ages and
called the first show they ever worked together ``179 Years of
Comedy.''
   At Madison Square Garden on Sunday night, Burns, 93, and Hope,
86, proved their funny bones still work _ though both kidded that
not everything does. Also, their timing and memory are still on.
And both sing better than Miss U.S.A., Gretchen Polhemus.
   Miss Universe, Angela Visser of Holland, fared better, just
exchanging quips, aided by cue cards, with Hope _ who has made
pretty girl walk-ons a tradition.
   In the show of nearly three hours, both comedians told age and
sex jokes, the latter mainly of the kind you could repeat to your
family later. Both told some jokes surely as old as they are. The
audience laughed as loud at those as at ones they hadn't heard
before.
   Hope's jokes flow fast and are many, about golf, flying,
doctors, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and his son's running for
Congress. ``I didn't know what to do with my life savings anyway.
It kept him from writing a book about me.''
   Burns spent all his time on stage puffing on a cigar and most of
it sitting in a swivel chair equipped with ashtray. He told about
starting in vaudeville, changing his name, his acts and his
partners.
   Then, charmingly reminiscent, he said, ``When I was 27, I had
good talent. And I was married to her 38 years.'' As a finale, with
Hope taking the late Gracie Allen's part, talking about her zany
relatives, the two did a Burns and Allen routine, dancing time
steps between punchlines.
   He isn't going to retire, Burns said spunkily. He's still making
movies _ ``If they do `God IV' I'll be glad to come down again'' _
and says since he's a senior citizen he can see himself for half
price.
   Hope, according to the Guinness Book of Records the most
decorated man in show business, opened the show, for 50 minutes.
Then Dionne Warwick sang, making a dynamic ``I'll Never Love This
Way Again'' the high point of her set.
   ``I'm not an opening act you know,'' Hope said. Adding that he
was glad to open for Burns, Hope said, ``If they ever have a Mount
Rushmore of comedians, this man has to be the first man on that
mountain.''
   Hope said he hadn't played New York since 1968 when he and Bing
Crosby put on the show that opened Madison Square Garden. That time
the stage also was in the center of the floor but it was rigged as
a boxing ring and Hope ``fought'' Rocky Marciano.
   This time, all Hope had to contend with was a comedian who could
one up him.
   He made his show business debut at 8 in New York, Burns said.
``They must have liked me. Here it is 85 years later and I'm back
again.''

<HEAD>British See Strong Future in U.S. Race Tracks With OTB</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can expect to hear more British accents
among the new breed of race track owners in the country.
   Bookmakers schooled in Britain's gaming industry that allows
bettors to put money on anything from the sex of a royal baby to
whether Elvis will return in a spaceship are looking to the United
States to strike out on their own or expand their vast holdings.
   Many of these entrepreneurs see this country as a growing
gambling market despite the threats of high land costs and
competition from state lotteries, illegal sports betting and
casinos.
   The lure of off-track betting in Pennsylvania and other states
has attracted the new race track buyers. For them, off-track
betting holds the promise of bringing gambling, specifically
thoroughbred and harness racing, to a broader range of people by
bringing it closer to their homes and offices in a fashionable
entertainment setting.
   At least five of the 10 major race track deals this year were
fueled by the buyer's desire to exploit off-track betting
opportunities or simulcasting, which allows tracks to take bets on
races at other tracks.
   ``European companies think America represents a tremendous OTB
opportunity,'' said Maury Wolff, a pari-mutuel industry consultant
with Racing Resource Group of Alexandria, Va. ``You have a history
of European success in OTB enterprises and I think the people who
run these enterprises look at the U.S. and see it as an untapped
market for off-track betting.''
   Bob Green and Bill Hogwood, two former officers in the
London-based Hill-Mecca gambling giant, left their jobs to form
Greenwood Racing Inc., which bought Philadelphia Park months after
off-track betting was approved in Pennsylvania. They paid $63
million for the track, nearly double what its previous owners paid
five years ago.
   The state's Horse Racing Commission has yet to approve the deal.
   Ladbroke Racing Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of British gambling
giant Ladbroke Group PLC, bought the Meadows, a harness track near
Pittsburgh, and Golden Gate Fields near San Francisco, where
California law allows horse players to bet at county fairgrounds.
   Ladbroke got its start in this country five years ago with the
purchase of Detroit Race Course. The Michigan Legislature has yet
to fulfill Ladbrokes' hopes the lawmakers would approve off-track
betting.
   ``We see OTB as an opportunity to provide the racing experience
to a wider range of people. ... It's one way to distribute to a
wider audience and make it more attractive,'' said David Goodwill,
president and chief operating officer of Ladbroke Racing.
   Another company, Oregon Racing, headed by another British gaming
executive, is in the process of buying Portland Meadows' operating
agreement to take advantage of simulcasting.
   Key to the pending sale of Canterbury Downs near Minneapolis are
plans to begin a simulcast agreement with Santa Anita race track in
California after the first of the year.
   Although the debate is just beginning in this country on
legalized sports betting, Wolff and others feel race tracks with
off-track betting facilities would be in the best position to take
sports wagers.
   Eugene Christiansen of the New York gaming consulting firm
Christiansen Cummings Inc. said off-track betting parlors would be
the obvious place to allow sports betting.
   ``Putting sports betting into the hands of mom and pop
operations would expose them to some not-too-friendly
competitors,'' Christiansen said, referring to the bookies that
dominate illegal gambling.
   In Pennsylvania the law allows the state's five tracks to open
five to six OTB parlors each.
   Pennsylvania's horse-racing industry lobbied hard for
legislation allowing off-track betting. Track owners warned their
betting windows had to be easily accessible to more people.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey, who had said he was opposed to any
state-sanctioned increase in gambling, vetoed the bill before the
General Assembly overrode him in 1988.
   For the former owners of Philadelphia Park, who got what most
observers feel was a generous price, off-track betting was the
saviour they had hoped.
   Track owners across the state undertook a last-minute campaign
to reverse the veto, convincing legislators that if OTB weren't
approved, their huge tracts of land would generate more money as
shopping malls, apartment complexes or industrial parks.
   Bob Brennan, head of International Thoroughbred Breeders Inc.,
the former owners of Philadelphia Park, had said the the track
would close its gates in February of this year if OTB were not
approved.
   Pennsylvania's new law allows the OTB sites within a 30-mile
radius of each of the state's five tracks. The legislation calls
for them to be well-kept bars or restaurants featuring pari-mutuel
betting on horse races.
   ``Think of the OTB parlors in New York and forget them,'' Bob
Green, president of Greenwood Racing Corp., the company that bought
Philadelphia Park, said of the largely utilitarian betting shops.
``We plan a clearly first-class facility.''

   Stakes are high and pockets deep at an annual
venture capital conference, where aspiring entrepreneurs try to
persuade investors to risk millions on business ideas ranging from
lightweight planes to submarine tours.
   ``We're real excited after our research,'' said Nancy Young,
who's looking for $3.8 million to buy a submarine and take tourists
for an underwater look at the Caribbean. ``We have found the
concept to be more interesting and profitable than when we first
conceived it a year ago.''
   She is hoping to follow such firms as Hospitality Network Ltd.,
which got $8.3 million in cash and credit two years ago. The
company has multiplied 10 times in value since then, founder Chris
Tyson said.
   Then there's Bookstop Inc., which got $3.5 million three years
ago when it was a five-store, money-losing chain.
   Last week, New York-based BDB Corp., parent of B. Dalton
Bookseller and Barnes &amp; Noble, paid a reported $10 million to buy
controlling interest in the company, which now operates 22 stores
in four states.
   ``Bookstop is on its way to doing the kind of fantastic things
that we all talk about,'' said Jerry White, director of Southern
Methodist University's Caruth Institute of Owner-Managed Business,
which is sponsoring the Southwest Venture Capital Conference in
Dallas.
   ``Basically what we do is give people a 10-minute opportunity.
Whether they pull it off is in their ball park,'' White said.
   ``Many of these (venture capital) firms you would have
difficulty getting an appointment with,'' White said, estimating it
would take a year and $100,000 of travel to get access to the same
investors.
   ``Getting past the secretary is going to be a major ordeal and
getting your story told is going to be another ordeal,'' he said.
``If you compete (in the conference) and win a spot you'll get your
story out to the industry.''
   This is the seventh conference the institute has sponsored along
with newly merged accountants Ernst &amp; Young and a Dallas law firm.
White estimates investors have provided $100 million to growing
businesses either directly from the conference or through contacts
made as a result of the meeting.
   The conference gave Tyson the opportunity he had been unable to
get elsewhere as he searched for investors in his Austin-based
Hospitality Network, which provides cable television service to the
hotel industry.
   ``On a wild hair I decided to submit a business plan to the
conference because I knew I would get in front of a bunch of
folks,'' Tyson said. ``I spoke, gave a little slide show on where
this company would go (and) we had 'em lining up at the door.''
   More than 150 business plans are submitted annually to the
conference. The plans are valuated and the 20 or so deemed to have
the best ideas are then given time in front of the potential
investors.
   ``The only people in the room are the presenters and the
investors,'' White said. Then the companies are given a room at one
of Dallas' upscale hotels where they wait to see if any interested
investors come by.
   There's a ``second 20,'' White said, who don't get time, but
have their plans forwarded to the investors. The remaining never
make it to the investors.
   That screening is what has made the conference popular with
venture capitalists, White said.
   ``If a venture capitalist can have a competitive committee of
people that screens 150 deals down to the best 20 and presents them
in a time-efficient process, we feel that's a very efficient mode
of looking for deals on behalf of the venture capitalist,'' he said.
   About 150 venture capital funds pay $150 each to attend the
conference; presenters, who are usually from the Southwest, pay
$500. This year's two-day conference starts Monday.
   White said many of the plans chosen are technology-driven,
reflecting investors' bias in that area, and generally are firms
that have been in business for some time and an experienced
management already in place.
   This year's finalists include eight high-tech firms that sell
software and other computer-related products. Others include a
company that designs, makes and markets solar collector products; a
manufacturer of low-cost, lightweight aircraft; and Young
Enterprises' idea for sub tours.

<HEAD>K mart Dreaming of `Green' Christmas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As part of an ambitious holiday sales campaign
that has the nation's second biggest retailer dreaming about a
``green'' Christmas, K mart Corp. has hooked up with NBC on a
television special.
   The holiday promotion is tied to a central theme that will be
reinforced with store signs, print and broadcast advertising and a
new song sung by Kenny Rogers, who stars in the TV show.
   Retailers usually pull out all the stops to pump up Christmas
sales because the season generates about half of their annual
profits.
   This year's peak shopping season will be particularly important
for K mart because the discounter didn't do as well as it might
have liked during the first half of 1989. Income sagged nearly 16
percent to $239 million in the first six months from $284 million
in 1988's first half.
   ``Christmas 1989 is going to be a very competitive year, there's
no doubt about it,'' said Michael G. Wellman, K mart's vice
president of marketing. ``For those retailers that really have a
strong merchandising and marketing program, Christmas will be very
merry.''
   Wellman said K mart's preparations, built around one main theme,
should put the retailer in a strong position to capitalize on
seasonal business.
   With a chain of 2,200 general merchandise stores spanning 48
states, K mart estimates that half of the U.S. population shops at
its stores each month.
   K mart is relying on a variation of the holiday theme it used
last year, taken from the book ``Christmas in America,'' a coffee
table pictorial of festivities and slices of life from around the
country.
   The book, which was in general distribution and sold at K marts
and the retailer's Waldenbooks stores, proved popular, earning a
place on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list for several
weeks running.
   The special to be aired on NBC during prime time the week of
Dec. 10, ``Christmas in America _ A Love Story,'' stars
singer-entertainer Kenny Rogers as a professional photographer.
   In the hour-long drama _ undoubtedly written for maximum
heartstring tugging at an emotionally charged time of year _ Rogers
flashes back on his life via his photographs, which are on exhibit
at a museum. Some of the photographs used in the TV special are
from the ``Christmas in America'' book and others are Roger's own.
   Roger's screen son is played by his real-life son, Kenny Rogers
Jr., and his wife by actress Ashley Crow.
   The film was produced by King World Productions Inc. and is the
first advertiser-supported network project for the King World
division formed last year to develop and produce original
programming sponsored by advertisers. King World distributes
several top syndicated programs, including ``Wheel of Fortune,''
``Jeopardy!'' and ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.''
   Barbara Loren, an advisor to K mart who is coordinating the
Christmas campaign, said the role the retailer played in bringing
the special to TV was unprecedented. It also represents a new twist
in a trend toward retailers and networks working closely together
on promotional efforts.
   K mart and CBS formed an alliance ahead of the new TV season
that had the two-fold purpose of boosting the retailer's
back-to-school business and touting the network's program lineup.
Retail industry leader Sears, Roebuck and Co. had a similar matchup
with NBC.
   The results are still coming in but the early readings indicate
the retailers benefited from their partnerships.
   ``There's nothing that we have seen to imply that this has been
anything less than a pretty successful promotion,'' Wellman said in
an interview. K mart and other major general merchandise chains,
department and specialty stores will report their September sales
on Thursday.
   Loren, president of the retail consulting firm Loren-Synder
Marketing Inc., said K mart helped initiate the TV special because
last year it had secured the film rights to the ``Christmas in
America'' book.
   Usually, a network owns a production and seeks advertisers to
support the programming. In this case, it was K mart executives who
pitched the idea to NBC, Loren said.
   The TV special is part of K mart's Christmas promotion, which
includes a range of marketing reinforcements to get across its
theme. Pictures of Kenny Rogers will be prominent in K mart stores
and a new song he has recorded, written by Dolly Parton, will be
piped over stores' public address systems.
   Loren said the mood of the country is such that the ``Christmas
in America'' ballad could become a hit.
   ``We are going to a traditional, conservative decade,'' she
said. ``The country is ready for the next `White Christmas.'''

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The immense business empire of the
Nationalist government, long a key element in the control of
Taiwan, is under attack and plans are being made to begin its sale.
   Now that the people of Taiwan have won some say in this island's
political process, they are demanding a larger share of the
economic pie. The government has reacted by promising to sell off
some of its numerous firms.
   But critics say the government and party aren't going far enough
and that Taiwan's rulers will maintain control of the financial
empire through joint ventures, stock schemes and other roundabout
ways.
   About half of all the total assets of Taiwan's companies are
controlled directly or indirectly by the ruling Nationalist Party
or the government. The net worth of these assets is more than $380
billion, according to Kang Ning-hsiang, a legislator of the
fledgling opposition Democratic Progressive Party who has
researched the holdings.
   Together the party and government dominate Taiwan's petroleum
industry; telecommunication systems; railways; steel, cement and
shipbuilding plants; and parts of the mass media.
   The government also owns 70 percent of Taiwan's 9 million acres
of land and maintains a firm grip on the economy through its
control of foreign exchange and the banking system.
   ``From gasoline for cars to raw materials for the clothes we
wear, everything is more or less under the Nationalist control,''
said Kang.
   Inhabitants on this island of 20 million, already among the most
densely populated in the world, have to fight ``the most severe
battle'' for the limited resources open to the public, said Kang.
   The Nationalists and as many as 2 million followers fled to
Taiwan in 1949 following their loss in a civil war to the Communist
forces in China. Since then the party and the state have been
inseparable. The Democratic Progressive Party, a legal entity since
1987, has yet to come close to challenging Nationalist supremacy.
   In Taiwan, economic interests have been the foundation of
Nationalist rule. Through them the party dispenses favors to
loyalists and privileges to cooperative private businesses.
   In the beginning, the favors went mostly to the mainlanders who
fled with the Nationalists. But as local Taiwanese slowly began to
assert themselves both economically and politically, the
Nationalists attempted to attract them with favors, too.
   Pressure on the party and government to turn state- and
party-run firms private increased after Taiwan lifted martial law
in 1987, paving the way for the current political liberalization.
   A prosperous economy added more pressure, creating an abundance
of idle cash looking for investment opportunities.
   In August, the government announced that 19 of Taiwan's 59
state-run firms will either go public or be sold to private
enterprises under a program that may take many years to complete.
   Among the firms to be made private are several banks, insurance
companies, chemical firms, steel mills and a shipbuilder. Many of
the concerns have lost money and drained government finances
despite their total or near monopolies.
   But the government will retain the bulk of its holdings, such as
the lucrative Chinese Petroleum Corp., which monopolizes oil
imports, exploration, refinery, gasoline stations and several
petrochemical products.
   ``The Nationalists will see to it that they will not lose much
of their economic or political influence'' with the conversion to
private companies, said Chu Yun-han, professor of political science
at the National Taiwan University.
   The government is expected to hold minority shares in the
companies it sells, thereby allowing the Nationalist Party
continued influence, Chu said.
   The party will continue to appoint retired officials as key
executives at the companies and secure the ``iron ballots'' of
employees in elections, he said.
   Despite the government's program to sell public companies,
Nationalist Party officials said they had no similar plans to
reduce the giant party-owned business empire.
   The party network of about 50 companies includes one that
finances all stock purchases for Taiwan's stock market.
   The party also owns a television station, a radio station and a
newspaper, constituting a powerful propaganda tool.
   Lawmakers from the Democratic Progressive Party have vowed to
end what they claim is ``the flow from national coffers to party
coffers.'' But most efforts have failed because of the complexity
of these businesses, many of which are joint ventures with private
businesses.
   The government decided this year to cut its annual subsidy of $9
million to the party's Broadcasting Corp. of China by 10 percent
each year for three consecutive years.
   Opposition activists accuse the Nationalists of funneling money
from their businesses into the campaign coffers of ruling party
politicians. The prestigious Journalist weekly said ruling
party-owned companies and other state sources contribute an
estimated $75 million to campaign funds in each national election.
   Political observers say exclusive government contracts or
monopolies of party-owned businesses eventually will have to end,
forcing some companies to close.
   But the road will be rocky.
   ``Most of the new benefits will go to the vested interests,''
says legislator Kang. ``True liberalization has a long way to go.''

<TEXT>
   Law has been very, very good to Joseph Dahr
Jamail.
   The celebrated Houston-based trial lawyer earned $450 million
last year, easily making him No. 1 on Forbes magazine's list of the
nation's highest paid lawyers.
   The business publication's list appears in the Oct. 16 issue
that hit newsstands on Monday.
   Calling lawyers the ``real champions of the American greed
game,'' Forbes says the high-priced advocates are rivaled only by
entertainers and Wall Street money men when it comes to
compensation.
   The 63 trial lawyers and 71 corporate lawyers on the list earned
a total of $860 million last year, according to Forbes' estimates.
On average, trial lawyers made eight times as much as their
corporate counterparts.
   They didn't have to endure the swings of the stock market or
attend fancy Ivy League law schools, either: 12 of the trial
lawyers on Forbes' list are alumni of the University of Texas Law
School.
   Jamail, who in 1988 earned more than Steven Spielberg, Bill
Cosby, Michael Jackson and Eddie Murphy combined, walked off with a
dazzling $420 million for his victory in the Texaco-Pennzoil case
last year, Forbes estimated. The magazine said bolder estimates of
his 1988 salary might be as high as $600 million.
   The nation's highest-paid lawyer won judgments and settlements
totaling an additional $100 million from his personal injury
practice, enough, Forbes said, to afford Jamail a 19-seat
Gulfstream jet.
   By contrast, runner-up Herbert Hafif, a Claremont, Calif.-based
lawyer, earned a mere $40 million last year.
   No. 3 among trial lawyers was Gerald Michaud, who earned $18
million last year, bolstered in part by a $16 million verdict in a
toxic shock syndrome case against Playtex International.
   Michaud's estimated pay was still much higher than the $5
million earned by Joseph Flom, one of the nation's best known
mergers and acquisitions lawyers and the leader of Forbes' list of
highest-paid corporate lawyers.
   Celebrity divorce lawyer Raoul Lionel Felder _ who represented
actress Robin Givens in her divorce from heavyweight boxing champ
Mike Tyson _ ranked second on the corporate lawyer list, earning an
estimated $3.8 million last year.
   The corporate crew is a far snobbier group; 53 percent went to
Ivy League law schools, compared with only 6 percent of the trial
lawyers on the list. Harvard had the highest number of graduates on
the Forbes corporate lawyer list, 17.
   Nine of the best-paid corporate lawyers work in the
entertainment field, including No. 3 Harry (Skip) Brittenham, who
earned $3 million last year representing such actor-clients as
Harrison Ford, Don Johnson, Melanie Griffith and Michael J. Fox.
   John Eastman, ranked No. 7 and best known for negotiating the
break-up of the Beatles, earned $3 million last year, mostly from
music clients that included David Bowie and Billy Joel. Eastman's
sister, Linda, is married to ex-Beatle Paul McCartney.
   The youngest lawyer to make the list was Joseph Power Jr., 36,
who earned an estimated $2.5 million last year. Power, who claims
he never has lost a case, hit his biggest jackpot with a $8 million
settlement in a medical malpractice case in 1984, Forbes said.

<HEAD>Braniff Plans 47 Flights Monday From 11 Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc., which grounded nearly all its
256 daily flights last week after entering federal bankruptcy court
proceedings, said Sunday it would offer 47 flights on Monday.
   The airline offered seats on the flights at $49 each, one-way
from 11 cities. The fare applies to flights between any two cities
in the system, but all flights will go through either Braniff's
Kansas City, Mo., hub or Orlando.
   Braniff increased service from four flights Thursday, when it
filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in federal
bankrupcty court in Orlando, to eight daily departures Saturday and
Sunday.
   ``We believe the routes we are operating with these highly
competitive fares will provide a solid foundation for further
expansion,'' Tom Volz, senior vice president for marketing, said in
a statement.
   The $49 one-way fares will be offered through Thursday, Braniff
said. The airline then will offer $99 one-way fares for the rest of
October.
   The Monday flights will serve Orlando; Kansas City; Los Angeles;
San Francisco; San Diego; Chicago; Newark, N.J.; Washington, D.C.,
National Airport; La Guardia Airport in New York; Dallas and
Phoenix.
   Before Wednesday, the airline operated 55 jets and flew to 39
U.S. cities and Nassau, the Bahamas.
   Braniff spokesman Don McGuire said discount fares appear to be
attracting travelers. As of Saturday afternoon, about half the
seats on some flights had been reserved for the reduced fare
flights.

<HEAD>Survey: Most American Executives Not Preparing for European Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just 37 percent of U.S. executives surveyed
recently said they have begun implementing strategies to deal with
the unified European market planned for 1992.
   ``The fact that the majority have not taken action shows they
may be greatly underestimating the impact of the single European
market on their businesses,'' said John J. Hurley, director of the
international division at Peat Marwick@Boston.
   The 12 member-nations of the European Economic Community plan to
dissolve market borders at the end of 1992, creating a unified
market with common product standards and expectations of greater
competition.
   The survey by the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick, released
last week, found that most U.S. executives believe a unified Europe
will benefit European firms and that American companies should ally
with European firms.
   Peat Marwick surveyed executives in four fields considered the
most likely yo be involved in trade with the EC: manufacturing,
high technology, merchandising and transportation.
   Of 10,000 surveys mailed in February and March to a random
sampling of executives, 993 were returned and 872 were usable,
according to Peat Marwick. The survey has a sampling error of plus
or minus 3 percent.
   More than half of the executives said they expected the overall
impact of the common European market on their industries in the
United States to be minimal.
   But 85 percent of the respondents said the merger would benefit
European firms, and 60 percent felt their own industries in Europe
could gain from the unified market.
   Most executives reported they believe the merger holds pitfalls
for U.S. companies that are not prepared.
   Eight in 10 respondents said they felt U.S. companies will be
pressured to acquire a European identity to gain from the new
arrangement. Seventy-five percent of respondents predicted European
authorities will grant special cost advantages to European
companies.
   One manufacturer counseled his peers against thinking the
Europeans would make it easy for U.S. businesses to compete,
according to the survey.
   ``They'll have the power in their hands. They'll have the bat,
the ball and the playing field,'' said the executive, who was not
identified.
   Eighty-seven percent of respondents advised U.S. firms to forge
alliances with their European counterparts and 81 percent suggested
the need for Americans to increase on-site manufactuing in Europe.
   The survey reported that large multinational firms in high
technology and manufacturing are taking the greatest care to
position themselves well for the new European market.
