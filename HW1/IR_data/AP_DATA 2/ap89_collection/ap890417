<HEAD>Barry Filed Federal Tax Returns Late</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry filed
his federal income tax returns late in the early 1980s even though
he had a refund coming each year, according to The Washington Post.
   The newspaper quoted an unnamed source as saying that Barry
waited until 1986 to file his 1982, 1983 and 1984 federal returns.
Other sources told the Post that Barry filed several returns in
1986 but could not confirm the years.
   Barry declined a request by the newspaper to be interviewed
about his tax returns. His press secretary, John C. White, released
a statement that Barry's returns are filed every year.
   ``First, my taxes are a personal matter between myself and the
federal and district governments. Second, my taxes are filed every
year by my accountant in the year in which they are due. Third, it
is a violation of law for someone to give out my tax returns other
than myself,'' Barry said in a statement.
   The mayor, who has refused to publicly release copies of his tax
returns since he was elected in 1978, filed late ``largely because
of procrastination,'' the Post, in its Tuesday editions, quoted one
of Barry's associates as saying.
   Failure to file a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor and
each count carries a possible one-year prison sentence.
   Although Barry's federal returns for 1982, 1983 and 1984 were
late, he apparently filed his D.C. returns on time for those years,
the Post said.
   D.C. records show that Barry filed his 1982, 1983 and 1984
returns in the year in which each return was due, according a
source familier with District tax records. Barry received D.C.
refunds for each of the years except 1982.

   Her own screams wake Susan Aniban
from nightmares about military captors connecting wires to her
thumbs, toes and breasts and sending jolts of electricity through
her naked body.
   Miss Aniban, 26, a volunteer for the church-affiliated Task
Force Detainees, said she and a male colleague were arrested in
November and accused of being couriers for communist rebels. She
denies it.
   She said she was interrogated at three military camps in the
Baguio area, where they were arrested, and her captors tried to
rape her three times.
   ``They tied my toes, thumbs and nipples with electric wires and
then they plugged it into a socket,'' she said. ``They did it to me
repeatedly and I fainted so many times.
   ``They took off my clothes and made me sit on a wet bed. I had
my hands tied in the back and a pillow over my mouth. I screamed,
and I felt like a chicken being butchered.''
   After three days, Miss Aniban and her colleague were released.
She said they had signed statements saying they were rebels and
agreeing to serve as military informants.
   She said she did not file charges against her captors because
whe felt it would be useless.
   Last year, she convinced her younger brother Jesus to leave the
rebels and he was shot to death five months later. As she cradled
her dying brother in her arms, Miss Aniban said, he told her his
assailants were pro-government militiamen.
   The family filed charges with the government Commission on Human
Rights and a civil court, but no hearings have been held.
   Her experiences made her bitter. Although she works for a human
rights group organized to monitor abuses under Ferdinand E. Marcos,
the exiled former president, she now opposes Corazon Aquino, his
successor.
   ``I expected my work to be risky, but I did not expect it could
still happen under the new government,'' she said. ``Now, she is no
longer my president.''

   Annette Funicello is gone, and so
are Sherry, Cubby, Darlene and Bobby.
   But Chase Hampton knocks 'em dead with a calypso song-and-dance
number. And Josh, Tiffini, Lindsey, Albert and the gang get the
studio jumping with a rap-and-disco blend of M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.
   The ``Mickey Mouse Club'' is back. And although its style has
been updated, the people at Walt Disney say it's just as good and
relevant as the original television show was when it began 34 years
ago.
   ``We had a lot of skepticism about doing the `Mickey Mouse Club'
in the 1990s,'' said Steve Fields, senior vice president of the
Disney Channel, which will carry the show. ``But so many elements
(of the old show) were terrific, and kids still relate to kids.''
   Just like its predecessor, the new show is for and by kids from
about ages 8 to 12 and features music, dancing, comedy skits,
celebrity guests and the Mickey Mouse Club movie. The comedy skits
are often geared to preteens' problems: dating, sibling rivalry,
messy rooms, homework.
   ``It's trying to say: `Hey, it's not easy being a kid. ... We're
going to make you laugh and reduce some of the stress,''' said
Steve Clements, executive producer.
   The show is designed to provide ``education through
entertainment,'' but the accent is clearly on the latter, Clements
says.
   ``It's all great fun. There are no messages that are knocked
into people's heads, no public service announcements about drugs or
anything like that,'' he said.
   ``This is my dream job,'' said head writer Alan Silberberg, who
has a master's degree in education from Harvard University. ``We
take entertainment and use it to educate about kids issues. ... The
show gives them a sense that they're not alone out there.''
   There's one big difference from the 1950s show _ cartoons have
been replaced by music videos. One of the early episodes features a
jazzy song-and-dance number on a New York City street set.
   Another innovation is a segment in which club members from
around the country are selected to spend a day with their special
heros. Among the celebrities taped so far are Los Angeles Dodgers
pitcher Orel Hershiser, model Christie Brinkley and New York
developer Donald Trump.
   In one segment, 13-year-old Tom Woods goes to New York's Trump
Plaza to talk with the developer about his business life and
disciplinary problems that caused him to be sent to a military
academy. Dressed in a suit and tie and calling himself a
``winner,'' the teen-ager asks for advice about investing $250 he
has saved. Trump tells him to put it in a bank until he is older.
   At the end, Tom presents Trump with a pair of Mickey Mouse ears,
which he adjusts over his carefully combed locks.
   The show is being taped before audiences at the new Disney-MGM
Studios complex in central Florida and will be televised
exclusively on the Disney Channel, which has about 4 million
subscribers. Fields said this will give Disney more control without
having to worry about ratings.
   Talent scouts held auditions for about 5,000 kids around the
country before selecting the lucky dozen featured on the show.
   The not-so-grown-up hosts are Fred Newman, an actor, writer and
comedian, and Mowava Pryor, a former camp counselor with theater
experience who has appeared in dozens of television commercials.
   The Mickey Mouse Club makes its debut April 24. The half-hour
show will be shown weekday afternoons.

   A 3-year-old girl, the survivor of a
rampage that claimed her mother, grandmother, two sisters, two
aunts and an unrelated man, was showered with toys Sunday as she
recovered from a slashed throat.
   Lawmen hunted her father, 28-year-old winery worker Ramon
Salcido, from Mexico to Canada.
   The object of compassion was 3-year-old Carmina Salcido, who was
rescued bleeding and barely conscious Saturday from a wine country
dump between Petaluma and Sonoma, near the bodies of her two
sisters, whose throats also were cut.
   Salcido has been hunted since Friday morning when officers
discovered the bodies of his wife, Angela, 24, at their Boyes Hot
Springs home; his mother-in-law and her two young daughters at
their home in Cotati; and a co-worker at the Grand Cru Winery.
Police have not yet pieced together the sequence of killings.
   ``We've got to find him, we've got to find him,'' Sonoma County
Sheriff Dick Michaelsen mumbled at a news conference Saturday after
the discovery of Carmina and her sisters.
   On Sunday, the owners of the Grand Cru Winery, where Salcido
worked as a forklift operator, offered a $5,000 reward for
information leading to his capture.
   ``These atrocities have caused fear and terror to invade an area
known for its beauty and hospitality,'' Walter and Bettina Dreyer
said in a statement.
   The couple also established a trust fund for both Carmina
Salcido and for the family of Tracy Toovey, an assistant winemaker
at Grand Cru, who was shot to death in Friday's rampage.
   Salcido has been described by neighbors as a hostile gun-toter
who drank a lot, a husband who harbored chronic, towering jealousy
of his attractive wife _ to the point that he drove home from work
several times a day to spy on her.
   Despite reports of Salcido's having problems at work, however,
Dreyer remembered his employee as a ``very competent'' worker who
was ``quick to please.''
   Carmina, her throat cut nearly from ear to ear, and her dead
sisters, Teresa, 1, and Sofia, 4, were found near a landfill
transfer station not far from where Salcido had fled with them
Friday.
   Carmina, also suffering exposure and dehydration, was flown to
Petaluma Valley Hospital, where she told deputies her father had
slashed her sisters and herself. After two hours of surgery,
Carmina was in stable condition.
   ``She's still in stable condition and doing well,'' nursing
supervisor Stasia Andrew said Sunday. ``Different people have sent
stuffed animals. She has a teddy bears and a couple of bunnies.''
   Doctors said she suffered some vocal cord damage but is expected
to recover.
   A trust fund was being established for Carmina in a Sonoma bank.
   Michaelsen said Salcido is the only suspect in the killings. A
ranch worker who was shot in a shoulder, apparently the first
person attacked, had alerted authorities, sending them first to the
winery where they found one man shot to death.
   At a news conference Friday, Michaelsen said a department
psychologist had warned that the savagery of the slayings indicated
Salcido ``no longer felt any affection or attachment to his own
children.''
   The three girls were spotted in a ravine near the dump by a man
working on his truck.
   ``At first he thought they were dolls,'' the sheriff said.
   The man, unidentified, called to a worker from the dump and the
two found ``yet another horrible scene,'' Michaelsen said.
   ``I tried to talk to the little girl who was still alive and I
tried to comfort her,'' said the dump worker, Tim Smith. ``Her
throat was nearly cut from ear to ear.''
   Autopsies performed Saturday in San Francisco revealed that Mrs.
Salcido had been shot, and her mother had been shot and her throat
was slashed, the sheriff's office reported. Mrs. Salcido's two
sisters, age 8 and 12, died of throat wounds apparently inflicted
with a knife and had been raped and sodomized, Michaelsen said.
   A friend and a neighbor described Salcido as fiercely jealous of
his wife.
   ``He's crazy. He was always going around with a gun,'' said
Richard Clark, a next-door neighbor to the Salcidos. ``I could see
it coming.''
   ``One time he threatened to blow (his wife's) head off,'' he
added.
   During the past week, Salcido was served with a Fresno County
court order to pay $511 a month child support to his ex-wife in
Fresno and nearly $6,000 for back support payments, according to
court papers.

   Moviegoers remember its destruction by
Martian invaders in ``War of the Worlds'' and TV viewers knew it as
the Daily Planet in the ``Superman'' series.
   But for millions, the city's most recognizable landmark, the
Byzantine-style City Hall tower, has been the center of government
in the nation's second largest city.
   The 27-story building, the area's tallest structure through the
1950s but now dwarfed by skyscrapers twice its size, is about to
get a facelift.
   Built in 1928 at $5 million, City Hall will soon undergo a $6
million makeover that includes illuminating the building at night.
   The renovation also includes a museum to display hundreds of
gifts that the city has received, many from visiting dignitaries.
   Project Restore, a nonprofit organization of business and civic
leaders, has raised about $1.5 million toward the project.

<HEAD>Zimbabwe Marks Ninth Birthday With Little to Cheer About</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Once hailed as a rare success story in a
continent plagued by coups, civil wars and corruption, this country
enters its 10th year of independence Tuesday with little of the
jubilation that marked its birth.
   When President Robert Mugabe led the white-ruled British colony
of Rhodesia to independence as black-governed Zimbabwe on April 18,
1980, he inherited one of the healthiest agriculture-based
economies in black Africa.
   After having waged a bloody, seven-year guerrilla war for
control of his homeland, he promised the 100,000 whites and 9
million blacks peace and prosperity.
   Many analysts believed Mugabe's Zimbabwe could serve as an
example for the white rulers of neighboring South Africa, who
maintain their black majority is not ready to run the country.
   Today, though still black Africa's most prosperous nation,
Zimbabwe is ailing.
   The economy is hemhorraging through shortages of foreign
currency and a lack of foreign investment, both symptoms of bad
policy making.
   Exporters who earn hard currency complain they get little
encouragement from the government, and because there is no
investment code the only significant foreign capital has been
plowed into a baked beans cannery and a bubble-gum factory.
   The leadership of Mugabe's avowedly egalitarian and socialist
state is crippled, thanks to a series of corruption scandals.
   Five Cabinet ministers, a provincial governor and a junior
minister have resigned and several others face prosecution in the
latest scandal, the black marketeering of cars and trucks.
   A war in neighboring Mozambique is bleeding this country's
treasury to the tune of half a million dollars a day. The 12,000
Zimbabwean troops there are guarding supply lines vital to
landlocked Zimbabwe's survival.
   At home, unprecedented popular discontent is growing over a host
of ills ranging from official greed and economic mismanagement to
record unemployment and galloping inflation.
   And homeless blacks often complain that land hunger, the main
cause of the war for independence, remains nine years later. While
160,000 families were promised plots, only 40,000 have actually
been resettled.
   On the credit side, Mugabe, 65, a onetime cattle herder and
school teacher, has fulfilled his promises of cheap education for
all and free health care for the poor, who comprise most of the
population.
   He also instilled national pride in the black majority that had
been subjugated by colonizers for nine decades, crushed a rebellion
by armed dissidents in the Matabeleland Province of western
Zimbabwe and ended a feud with his old political foe, Joshua Nkomo.
   The two signed an accord that will unite their parties in the
next year as a prelude to establishing a one-party state in one of
Africa's few Western-style democracies.
   But there has been mounting criticism that it could transform
Zimbabwe into a leftist dictatorship, like Angola and Ethiopia,
where the vote Zimbabweans fought for will be worthless.
   ``The leadership is rotten, and it will get more rotten in a
one-party state,'' says Edgar Tekere, 52, a founder of the
governing Zimbabwe African National Union and now its most vocal
critic.
   Tekere, fired from the 15-member Politburo and the 90-strong
Central Committee in October after he denounced top-level
corruption, represents Mugabe's only real political challenge. He
has won widespread popular support for his stand.
   Public hostility toward elected leaders has grown in the last
few years as politicians have vaunted their wealth, power, position
and privileges.
   Cabinet ministers last year voted themselves earnings 20 times
the statutory minimum wage of $50 monthly, which they also set.
   Most own several homes and farms, have interests in stores,
hotels and other businesses, drive around in chauffeured limousines
and frequently travel abroad to buy luxury items not available at
home.
   ``In our pubs we don't talk much about anything else but crooked
politicians,'' said Oddwell Mlambo, 34, an unemployed laborer. ``No
one attacks Mugabe himself, but if there were elections tomorrow,
just about all his Cabinet would be thrown out.''

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews conducted March 6 through March 15
with 1,108 adults in the continental United States.
   Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were
conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random
phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19
times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to
it, should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not? Yes: 65
percent. No: 25 percent. Don't know or no answer: 10 percent.
   2. Should abortion be legal as it is now; legal only in such
cases as rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother; or should
it not be permitted at all? As now: 50. In cases: 39. Not at all:
7. Don't know-No answer: 4.
   3. Would you favor or oppose a constitutional amendment that
would make abortions illegal except in cases of rape, incest or to
save the life of the mother? Favor: 44. Oppose: 50. Don't know-No
Answer: 5.
   4. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that states cannot
prevent a woman from having an abortion if she wants one at any
time during the first three months of pregnancy. Do you favor or
oppose that ruling? Favor: 53. Oppose: 41. Don't know-No Answer: 6.
   5. If the Supreme Court reversed its 1973 ruling and let each
state make its own abortion laws, abortion could become legal in
some states and illegal in others. Would you want abortion to be
legal or illegal in your state? Legal: 57. Illegal: 37. Don't
know-No Answer: 7.
   6. If abortion was illegal in your state, do you think that
would stop most women there who want abortions from having them, or
would most of them go to another state where it was legal? Stop: 7.
Go: 87. Don't know-No Answer: 6.
   7. If abortion was illegal in every state, do you think that
would stop most women who want abortions from having them, or would
most of them have illegal abortions or go to another country for
abortions? Stop: 20. Go: 73. Don't know-No Answer: 7.
   8. A group that opposes abortion has been holding demonstrations
where its members block the entrances to abortion clinics until the
police arrest them and carry them off. How do you feel about these
demonstrations _ support them strongly, support them, oppose them,
or oppose them strongly? Support strongly: 4. Support: 18. Oppose:
37. Oppose strongly: 30. Don't know-No Answer: 11.
   9. A pill is now available in France that stops pregnancy by
preventing the fertilized egg from becoming implanted in the
uterine wall. Do you think this drug should be legal in the United
States, or not? Yes: 51. No: 24. DK-NA: 25.
   10. I'd like to ask your opinion on this statement: The
government should help a poor woman with her medical bills if she
wants an abortion. Please tell me whether you agree or disagree.
Agree: 41. Disagree: 49. Don't know-No Answer: 11.

   A series of bomb blasts in this city's
crowded commercial center killed one person and injured 20 Sunday,
the fifth day of a government-called cease-fire, authorities said.
   No one took immediate responsibility for the bomb blasts. Both
Tamil militants and majority Sinhalese extremists have carried out
their own campaigns of terror.
   Police said all the victims were Tamil, and most of the injured
were in critical condition.
   The blasts came in the wake of an offer for peace talks by Tamil
rebels. A spokesman for President Ranasinghe Premadasa called the
rebel offer ``a major breakthrough'' shortly after it was made
Saturday.
   Premadasa responded by asking the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, the largest and most powerful Tamil rebel group, to send
their leaders to meet with him. Presidential press secretary Evans
Cooray said a message had been sent to Anton Balasingham, political
leader of the group, asking him to choose representatives for the
talks.
   The Tamils made their offer hours after an ambush blamed on the
rebels left 21 soldiers dead. The attack raied to 79 the number of
people killed in three days of violence.
   Two of the bombs went off near a stand for buses bound for
northern Jaffna town, a Tamil stronghold, police said. All the
casualties occurred there.
   Another bomb, also placed in a bag and left on the sidewalk,
exploded near a building where a former Tamil rebel group that has
now joined the political mainstream kept its offices, police said.
The building was damaged.
   Militant Tamils are waging a war against the government for an
independent state. At least 10,000 people have been killed since
the Tamil insurrection started in 1983.
   The Tamils claim they suffer discrimination at the hands of
mostly Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population
and control the government and military. Tamils, who are mostly
Hindus, comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   Premadasa ordered a one-week cease-fire and offered amnesty to
rebels willing to surrender arms in an effort to curb the ethnic
violence that has plagued this Indian Ocean island.

   The government is banning racy
television advertisements and commercials that show only
non-Malaysian models, the information minister said in an interview
published today.
   Beginning July 1, Caucasian and other non-Malaysian models can
continue to appear in commercials only if the ads also include
Malays, Chinese, Indians or other races that predominate in
Malaysia, said Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat.
   ``We have told advertisers that if the cast is a mix of
Caucasian, Pan-Asian and some of the multi-racial groups in
Malaysia, we will allow the commercials to appear,'' Rahmat said in
an interview published in the New Straits Times daily.
   Commercials with women in swimsuits and scanty clothing will
also be banned in this country Islam where is the official religion.
   Of the country's three TV channels, two are owned by the
government and the other belongs to the ruling party.
   Michael Tang, Association of Accredited Advertising Agents of
Malaysia President, said the ban was ``a little too harsh and
debatable'' and called for the review of the ban.
   Malaysia's 17 million population is 55 percent Malay and 37
percent Chinese, with the remainder mainly Indian.

   IRS employees put in overtime, post offices
set up special mail drops and demonstrators made their cases as the
nation prepared to end another federal tax return filing season at
midnight tonight.
   Internal Revenue Service spokesman Frank Keith said the IRS had
no way of knowing how many taxpayers were waiting until the last
minute to file. But the agency expects to receive 18 million
returns this week, including those filed over the weekend, he said.
   The deadline is one day later in New England and most of upstate
New York because today is Patriot's Day, a legal holiday, in
Massachusetts, site of the IRS center which processes returns from
taxpayers in those states.
   The IRS expects to receive more than 109 million returns this
year, many of which will come in well after the deadline.
   About 6 million couples and individuals are expected to get an
extra four months to file _ but not to pay any taxes due _ by
mailing Form 4868 before midnight. Many of the 650,000 Americans
who live and work abroad are likely to take an automatic two-month
extension. And, as usual, some taxpayers simply will miss the
deadline and face a late-filing penalty.
   In many IRS offices, employees planned to continue offering
advice tonight as long as taxpayers were asking for it.
   The Postal Service was doing its part by setting up booths at
ballparks, selling stamps by the curb, and cooperating with radio
stations and civic groups that were offering refreshments around
post offices in an effort to make things a little easier for
procrastinators.
   Around the nation, the Jobs for Peace Campaign sent
demonstrators into the streets to protest military spending. They
planned to pass out ``Build Homes _ Not Bombs'' stickers for
taxpayers to attach to the envelopes containing their tax returns.
   The campaign is urging support for a bill to finance more
housing by cutting military spending. The group calculates that 52
cents of every tax dollar goes for military spending, retirement
and interest on money borrowed to finance weapons. By government
figuring, the military will take 27 percent of next year's budget,
not including interest or pensions.
   In Washington, Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., repeated a tax-day
act he has performed for 10 years: introducing a bill that would
allow conscientious objectors to pay their taxes into a fund that
would be spent for non-military purposes.
   ``We recognize conscientious objection in time of war,''
Hatfield said in a statement. ``It is now time to recognize it in
time of peace.''
   The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents most IRS
employees, issued a statement accusing the Bush administration of
failing to budget enough money to finance the tax-collection
agency. Employee travel and training have been cut and technicians
have been pressed into clerical work because of the tight budget,
said Robert M. Tobias, president of the union.
   By its actions, he said, the administration ``effectively
declared April 17 a national holiday for tax cheaters.''
   The Church of Scientology used the filing deadline as a way of
reminding taxpayers of a new law designed to protect them when they
have disputes with the IRS. The church, which has had its share of
scraps with the agency, announced it has published a free guidebook
to the ``Taxpayer Bill of Rights.''

<HEAD>Nuke Plant Shut for Sleeping Operators Set to Reopen</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: meeting late afternoon EDT; top prospects uncertain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only nuclear plant ever shut down because
control room operators slept on duty is ready to resume operations,
amid signs that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will give its
assent.
   An NRC order has kept the Peach Bottom plant in Pennsylvania
dormant for two years, but the commission planned a meeting for
this afternoon along with a ``possible'' vote on reopening.
   Privately, commission officials said last week that all signs
pointed to the plant gaining permission _ if not today, then
shortly afterward _ to begin a slow ascension that would take it
back to full power.
   Thomas Murley, the NRC's top reactor licensing official,
declined to make a prediction Friday on the outcome of the meeting.
   But he said in an interview that the commission has seen
significant progress in the management of the plant by Philadelphia
Electric Co.
   ``Clearly there have been big changes in the company, and it's a
new company as far as Peach Bottom is concerned,'' Murley said.
``The operators have been retrained and there appears to be a new
attitude.''
   As the only plant ever shut down because of operator negligence,
Peach Bottom is unique in the industry. Dealing with operators _
with people _ is vastly different than replacing equipment, and the
shutdown has meant a review of the plant's entire management
structure.
   The plant, located on the Susquehanna River near the Maryland
border, was ordered to stop producing power on March 31, 1987, by
the NRC, which said continued operation posed a public safety
threat.
   A year later, James L. Everett stepped down as the utility's
chairman and chief executive officer following criticism of the
handling of Peach Bottom.
   Philadelphia Electric has spent about $250 million in
shutdown-related costs. The figure includes modifications to the
plant, purchases of replacement power, and the company's share of a
$1.25 million fine, the largest in NRC history.
   While the utility has shuffled its personnel, the changes at the
plant have included more than just new faces. The company said
management will play a broader role in day-to-day plant affairs
than before.
   To end catnaps by operators, plant officials replaced
comfortable, high-backed chairs in the control room with low-backed
models. Operators' rotations have been changed so that workers do a
week of days, followed by a week of an afternoon-evening shift, and
then work the overnight.
   The rotation, which includes days off, used to go in the reverse
order.
   The sleeping problems at Peach Bottom were not confined to a few
workers. Last August, 33 present or former operators were fined
$500 to $1,000 for ``sleeping and-or other acts of inattention to
duty.''
   ``We didn't set out to pick somebody and make an example of
them,'' Murley said. ``It's just that the behavior we saw at Peach
Bottom was so egregious that we felt we had no choice but to order
them shut down. INPO (the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations)
came to same conclusion and put more pressure on the top
management.''
   INPO, an Atlanta-based nuclear watchdog group, termed the plant
``an embarrassment to the industry and the nation'' in 1988.
   But this year, the group said Philadelphia Electric's corrective
actions at Peach Bottom have been ``responsive and effective.''
   The utility said it would propose restarting one of its two
working reactors, then seek permission to fire up the other one
later this year. It would take a few months for either of the units
to reach full power once approval is granted.

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some small towns aspire to bigger
things. But folks in this one hope to get even smaller _ about a
thousand pounds smaller.
   In a modern day battle of the bulge, about 200 people in
Cleveland _ population 26,400 _ and surrounding Bradley County are
competing with residents of Sac County, Iowa, to see who can shed
the most. The competition is designed to promote the benefits of
proper nutrition and exercise.
   ``The county that loses has to fly the flag of the other county
for 30 days,'' says Bob Taylor, head of the Cleveland-Bradley
Chamber of Commerce Wellness Committee, which is sponsoring the
effort.
   Sac County, a farming region of about 14,000 people in northwest
Iowa, organized a mass slim-down two years ago to bolster morale
during the farm crisis, says Shirley Phillips, director of the Sac
County Economic and Tourism Development Council.
   Last year, nearly 800 participants walked or biked 286,686 miles
and lost 6,438 pounds. That was enough to get national media
attention. When Bradley County officials called for information,
the Iowans issued their challenge and the meltdown was on.
   This year, more than 1,000 people from Sac County are involved,
including 543 who are competing against 203 Tennesseans.
   The Sac County team weighed in at 78,851 pounds earlier this
month; the Bradley team tipped the scales at 36,926 pounds.
Whichever teams loses the greatest percentage of weight by June 24
wins.
   Both counties feature competitions among individual teams with
names like ``Bulge Busters.'' Taylor says that's helped make things
interesting.
   ``When you see 15 women get on a big scale and check in at over
a ton, well, that's something,'' said Taylor.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Echoes of a Speakers' Scandal Followed Blaine for
Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the morning of June 5, 1876, James G.
Blaine, the speaker of the House of Representatives, stood in the
well of the House and waved a packet of letters in the air.
   Blaine, one of the nation's foremost politicians, was in serious
trouble.
   And he was about to confound his accusers.
   Nearly 113 years later another speaker of the House _ Jim Wright
of Texas _ faces accusations of unethical behavior in office.
   Wright adamantly denies any wrongdoing. But he has been the
subject of the most prolonged and intense of the several
investigations conducted over the decades into the private and
public affairs of a speaker of the House.
   Speaker Blaine rode out his scandal, but echoes of it were to
follow him for the rest of his career.
   In the spring of 1876, Blaine was a frontrunner for the
Republican presidential nomination in the election that would
replace President Ulysses S. Grant's corruption-ridden
administration.
   Three years earlier Reps. Oakes Ames, R-Mass., and James Brooks,
D-Mass., had been censured by the House for involvement in the
so-called Credit Mobilier scandal in which railroad construction
stock had been given to selected members of Congress, allegedly for
favors received.
   Now Blaine became embroiled in the scandal, facing accusations
that the Union Pacific Railroad had paid the speaker an inflated
price for stock of a defunct and bankrupt rail line.
   An investigation was launched by the House Judiciary Committee
but it was sputtering when new evidence emerged.
   It took the form of a set of letters between Blaine and a
business partner which had come into the possession of a third man,
James Mulligan.
   Mulligan, in Washington to testify before the committee,
encountered an unexpected visitor at his hotel _ Speaker James G.
Blaine.
   According to Mulligan, an emotional session followed in which
Blaine fell to his hands and knees and begged for the letters,
threatening suicide if he did not receive them.
   Mulligan claimed Blaine obtained the letters by a pretext and
left the hotel.
   An uproar followed and Blaine came under intense pressure to
make the Mulligan letters public. He refused, claiming they were
private property.
   Instead, he obtained a statement from two lawyers who said they
had examined the letters and found nothing relevant to the
investigation.
   The uproar continued and Blaine set about to defuse it.
   On June 5 he appeared on the House floor and waved the packet
exclaiming, ``There they are. ... There are the original letters.''
   Blaine then read aloud what he said were the contents of each of
the letters. He said he had handed over ``every solitary scrap and
scrimption'' for inclusion in the Congressional Record.
   They had, he declared, ``no more to do with that investigation
than the North Pole.''
   But no one was ever shown the originals of the letters to verify
Blaine's reading of them.
   Events moved rapidly.
   Blaine collapsed outside his church suffering from a possible
heat stroke. The investigation was postponed for two weeks to await
his recovery. But before the committee could reconvene, the
governor of Maine appointed Blaine to fill a vacancy in the Senate.
   The investigation was postponed again, and eventually died.
   Blaine's political backers proceeded, in classical Washington
fashion, to make the best of a bad situation.
   In the 20th century it's called making lemonade out of a lemon.
   Blaine's name was placed in nomination at the Republican
National Convention by Robert G. Ingersoll on June 15, 1876, with
words that gave Blaine an enduring nickname: ``The plumed knight
from the state of Maine.''
   ``Like an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine
marched down the halls of the American Congress and threw his
shining lance full and fair against the brazen forehead of every
traitor to his country and every maligner of his fair reputation.''
   Blaine never obtained the presidency.
   But he twice was appointed secretary of state.
   No House speaker has ever been ousted. But several have been
singed during the 200-year history of Congress.
   Henry Clay, who was elected speaker six times, drew accusations
of ``corrupt bargain'' when the close election of 1824 was thrown
into the House of Representatives.
   The choice was between Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.
Clay and other members of the Kentucky delegation tipped the
balance in favor of Adams.
   The accusations flew after the victorious Adams named Clay as
his secretary of state.
   Speaker Samuel J. Randall, a Pennsylvania Democrat, promptly
called for his own investigation in 1879 after being accused of
favoritism toward a company which provided the paper for the bonds
and banknotes produced by the Bureau of Engraving.
   He was quickly cleared.
   In 1910 Speaker Joseph G. Cannon faced a rebellion against his
imperious and heavy handed rule of the House.
   Although not deposed, Cannon was stripped of much of his power.
   Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, D-Mass., was named in the
so-called ``Koreagate'' influence peddling scandal in the 1970's
but was exonerated.

   Leave the kids at home, skip the Lincoln
Memorial and take a ``scandal tour'' of Washington, a raunchy romp
through the ruins of political careers that takes ogling grownups
from the Watergate to Gary Hart's old townhouse.
   With a George Bush impersonator acting as host, the 75-minute
bus tour leaving on weekends from the posh Ritz-Carlton Hotel is
just the tonic for bored tourists willing to spend 20 bucks to
indulge their taste for the trashy.
   Careening through city streets in a red, white and blue bus, a
satirical comedy troupe called Gross National Product entertains
customers with a bawdy commentary on passing landmarks where some
of Washington's most prominent residents fell prey to sex, booze,
greed or lust for power. Mostly sex.
   Outside the White House, a Marilyn Monroe look-alike croons a
song to John F. Kennedy, the gentleman who supposedly preferred
blondes. ``In my eight years in office, there will be no sex in the
White House,'' vowed Bush, seizing the microphone.
   Past the Executive Office Building, where mock secretary Fawn
Hall sobs her admiration for Col. Oliver North _ ``the most
patriotic man in the universe'' _ and recalls their Iran-Contra
shredding parties. Passengers are given small plastic bags filled
with shredded paper and signed ``Love, Fawn.''
   On to the Tidal Basin, where an inebriated Wilbur Mills saw both
his congressional career and his companion, stripper Fanne Foxe,
sink beneath the waves. Then to the Capitol, where John and Rita
Jenrette enjoyed a congress of a different sort and where a
homosexual congressman ``let his fingers do the walking through the
House and Senate pages.''
   The bus screeched to a halt behind the Capitol Hill townhouse
where Hart was caught entertaining model Donna Rice, dooming his
1988 Democratic presidential hopes. It's still the highlight of the
tour.
   ``Everybody out for some fresh air and fresh smut,'' shouted a
female tour guide. ``You're going to get out of the bus, you're
going to see it, you're going to touch it, you'll be there.''
   The crowd clustered around the garage where ``Donna Rice made
her backdoor debut for the Miami Herald,'' then strolled to the
front of the house to pose for pictures. Back on the bus, the
tourists sighed happily.
   ``What makes the best scandal?'' the guide asked.
   ``Sex,'' someone replied.
   ``Illicit sex,'' corrected a woman sitting in the rear.
   As the bus forged ahead, a black-robed comic posing as former
Supreme Court nominee Douglas Ginsburg offered to sell nickel bags
of marijuana and ``crank up some George Carlin tapes.'' A mimic of
Vice President Dan Quayle promised to ``serve you like I served the
National Guard _ on weekends.''
   Rick London, the 34-year-old writer and producer who founded
``Scandal Tours'' last August, said he was inspired while escorting
friends and relatives from his native Hattiesburg, Miss., to the
city's usual monuments and historical sites.
   ``I'd take them to the Capitol or the White House and you could
see their eyes start to glaze over,'' he says. ``Sooner or later,
they'd ask, `Where's Gary Hart's townhouse?' and I'd take them.
Then I thought, I ought to charge for this.''
   The tours are especially popular with British tourists and
Japanese businessmen, London says. He's making plans to start
``scandal tours'' in London, where ``the Brits take the prize,''
and possibly Rome and Paris.
   John Simmons, who plays Bush on the tour, says Washington
provides a constant source of comedy material because of its
explosive mixture of power, money and sex. The result, he says, is
``bad things happening to people it is hard to feel sorry for.''
   London says the tour focuses on sex scandals because they're
``easier for people to understand'' than complicated affairs
involving financial wrongdoing.
   He says he's found that Republicans account for 90 percent of
Washington's money scandals, while Democrats are usually the
culprits in sex scandals.
   ``That means that Republicans are spending a lot of time making
money,'' he said, ``and you can guess the rest.''

   Princess Anne took a riding lesson during the
1989 World Cup show equestrian jumping championships, then
dismounted and sidestepped sensitive questions.
   The princess, whose marriage of 15 years to Mark Phillips is
said to be in trouble, maintained a low profile during her
three-day visit for the championship that ended Sunday.
   During a 15-minute session with reporters at the Florida State
Fairgrounds, the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II declined to comment
on Saturday's melee at a British soccer stadium that left at least
94 people dead.
   Reporters asked about the tragedy although they had been told to
limit their questions to horse-related matters.
   Earlier, she took a morning ride at the Bob Thomas Equestrian
Center under the direction of George Morris, a leading equestrian
trainer.
   A small crowd, consisting mostly of photographers and
plainclothes guards, watched the lesson, which Princess Anne said
was ``a very interesting experience and no doubt will do me a world
of good.''
   The princess presented the World Cup trophy to Ian Millar, who
successfully defended his title.

   Former actress Audrey Hepburn has given
emotional testimony on the hunger, starvation and death she
witnessed during a mercy mission to Sudan.
   Describing new arrivals at a refugee camp near the center of the
war-torn country, the goodwill ambassador of the United Nations
Children's Fund said Sunday:
   ``They have nothing left _ not even their bodies. They are so
emaciated. It seems that all they have left are their souls.''
   Ms. Hepburn spoke at a news conference in Nairobi, the first of
many she will conduct to publicize a massive U.N. Relief effort for
the southern Sudan.
   That effort has been plagued by delays caused by political
problems, weather and lack of equipment. U.N. officials have all
but conceded they will not meet their initial deadlines.
   They had hoped to move 105,000 tons of food, medicine and other
supplies into southern Sudan before the start of heavy rains in May
that close most roads and all but a few airstrips.
   With time running out before the storm season, directors of the
$172 million Operation Lifeline Sudan are considering air drops to
isolated and stranded villages.
   Ms. Hepburn, 59, visited three refugee camps in Sudan last week.

   Director Alan J. Pakula's latest film is about
the difficulties of a couple in their courtship leading to a second
marriage _ a subject he knows from personal experience.
   It is no accident that ``See You in the Morning'' is the first
film Pakula has written, directed and produced because the question
of personal control and vulnerability is key to the project.
   Pakula, director of such films as ``Klute,'' ``All the
President's Men,'' and ``Sophie's Choice,'' slipped into the second
person tellingly while discussing the film with The New York Times.
   ``Coming out of a bad experience, a relationship that failed,
there's a part of you that matures underneath that,'' Pakula said
in the interview published Sunday. ``But there's a part of you that
goes back to younger kinds of insecurities and vulnerabilities.
Rejection can do that to you.''
   In the film, which opens this week, Jeff Bridges and Alice Krige
play a couple whose previous marriages have failed. The film relies
on flashbacks to reveal how the two are haunted by the past as they
encounter one another.
   Pakula's first marriage, to the actress Hope Lange, ended 20
years ago. His current wife, biographer Hannah Cohn Boorstin, was a
widow when they met. They married in 1973.
   Pakula's troubles took place in California, while the film is
set in New York, and the couple portrayed are in their mid-30s,
younger than he was while he endured his own tough times, Pakula
said.
   ``I deliberately did not place them in a setting that would be
literally familiar to me,'' Pakula said.

   Tom Monaghan owns the Detroit Tigers
baseball club and one of the biggest pizza chains in the country,
but he always wanted a farm.
   So Monaghan, owner of Ann Arbor-based Domino's Pizza Inc.,
joined with a retired Alabama agriculture professor in a project
they hope will prove there's still money in small farms.
   Monaghan is financing the 25-acre spread three miles outside of
Ann Arbor. The soggy fields began their transformation last fall
under the supervision of Booker T. Whatley, author of the book
``How to Make $100,000 Farming 25 Acres,'' The Grand Rapids Press
reported Sunday.
   The goal is to show that farms of 10 to 200 acres can succeed as
well as family-run operations of 200 to 1,000 acres and
agribusiness concerns of 1,000 acres or more.
   ``This country can and should support all three categories,''
said Whatley, 73, formerly of the faculty of Tuskegee Institute and
publisher of the Small Farm Technical Newsletter.
   Monaghan read about Whatley in The Wall Street Journal. Seeing a
chance to fulfill his own dream, he introduced himself at a
speaking engagement by the agricultural theorist in Lansing.
   Since fall, workers have dug a trout pond, established a fallow
deer herd and begun building a 1-acre sinking garden for vegetable
production, farm manager Michael Trout said.
   Whatley's book argues that small farms can succeed if they
provide a year-round daily cash flow, produce at least 10 different
products with no one product making up more than 10 percent of the
gross, and produce goods that have definite markets.
   Monaghan said he will give his Domino's headquarters employees
the option of spending occasional days at the farm instead of
working their desk jobs.

   Uruguayans on Sunday voted not to end
an amnesty for soldiers and police accused of human rights abuses
during the 1973-85 military dictatorship.
   With 6,360 of 7,072 districts reporting in the referendum on the
1986 amnesty, supporters tallied 922,185 votes, or 53.32 percent,
according to the Interior Ministry, and while opponents numbered
678,087, or 39.21 percent.
   About 128,969 votes, or 7.47 percent, were blank, annulled or
ruled questionable for technical reasons.
   Early today, a co-president of the National Commission for a
Referendum conceded defeat.
   ``The law has been confirmed,'' Matilde Rodriguez Larreta told
reporters. ``Without doubt, the pronouncement of the popular will
should be adhered to.''
   However, she called for a ``national compromise'' on the issue,
and said, ``about 40 percent voted to annul the law. ... The
country and all its institutions cannot be insensitive to the
circumstances that nearly one-half of the population disagrees
radically'' with the amnesty.
   Unofficial tallies indicated that voters in the capital narrowly
rejected the amnesty while voters in the countryside heavily
favored it.
   Shortly after polls closed at 7:30 p.m (6:30 p.m. EDT) and
before any results were known, President Julio M. Sanguinetti
called for national unity in an address carried on national radio
and television.
   ``Until a short while ago, some of us were `yellows,' others
`greens,''' he said. ``That has just ended. ... We are all
Uruguayan citizens and now we have to listen to the voice of the
people.''
   Supporters of the amnesty cast yellow ballots; opponents cast
green ones.
   The government, including Sanguinetti, supported the 1986 law
giving amnesty to scores of police and soldiers accused of human
rights abuses in a campaign against leftist guerrillas during 12
years of military rule.
   Leftist political parties and human rights groups, which mounted
a huge petition drive to put the issue to a vote, say trials of
those accused of human rights abuses are necessary before democracy
can be considered fully restored.
   After campaigning ended on Thursday, both sides pledged to
respect the outcome.
   By late Sunday night, neither side had claimed victory or
conceded defeat.
   ``We're still gathering information and making our own
computations,'' said Alberto Perez Perez, a spokesman for the
National Commission for a Referendum. The Interior Ministry
estimated that about 65 percent of the 2.3 million Uruguayans
eligible to vote had cast ballots.
   Voting is mandatory in Uruguay and turnout usually tops 80
percent. Turnout apparently was lower than usual Sunday because of
gray skies and rain.
   But lines were long from the moment schools, cultural centers,
movie theaters and other places used as polling stations opened.
Many voters waited for an hour or longer huddled under umbrellas or
building overhangs.
   ``A country that forgets its past has no future,'' said a
well-dressed woman standing in line to vote in a neighborhood along
the estuary of the River Plate. ``A future of peace and justice
depend on overturning'' the amnesty, said the woman, who refused to
give her name.
   If voters rejected the amnesty, trials would not start
immediately. Vice President Enrique Tarigo said the Supreme Court
then would have to decide whether the amnesty would be annulled _
meaning a ruling that it never legally existed _ or merely
overturned.
   If the law were just overturned, the change could not be applied
retroactively.
   The amnesty freed security forces from the possibility of
prosecution in connection with a 1970s crackdown on leftist
subversion. About 150 Uruguayans were killed and 200 were arrested
and never seen again. Thousands suffered physical and psychological
torture under detention.
   The military maintains it was fighting a war against urban
guerrillas, particularly the leftist Tupamaros, whose bombings,
kidnappings and assassinations had convulsed the country for years.
   The military took control in February 1973 by setting up a
security council with the authority to veto government decisions.
Four months later, it forced President Juan M. Bordaberry to
dissolve congress.
   The Tupamaro urban guerrillas by that time had been quelled as a
military threat, and the armed forces began to crack down on
leftist subversion in general.
   Sanguinetti was elected in November 1984 after democracy was
restored.
   By 1986, about 50 cases had been filed accusing about 180
soldiers and police of kidnapping, murder and torture.
   The military high command said it would not require soldiers to
answer charges in civilian courts. Sanguinetti broke the impasse by
pressing for an amnesty, which Congress passed on Dec. 22, 1986.
   Human rights and leftist political groups vowed to challenge the
amnesty in a vote. The Electoral Court last year affirmed that the
required 555,701 voters, or 25 percent of the electorate, had
signed petitions for a referendum.

   Most of the 1 million elderly poor people who
do not get the government benefits to which they are entitled
either do not know they are eligible or are incapable of filling
out the necessary forms, a private foundation said today.
   The study by The Villers Foundation was aimed at answering the
perplexing question of why only about half of those eligible take
advantage of the Supplemental Security Income program established
by Congress in 1972. The program is intended to provide a minimal
income floor for the nation's aged, disabled and blind.
   ``Some people say that the poor don't apply for SSI because they
are embarrassed. We found that's not the heart of the problem,''
said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of the non-profit
foundation that concentrates on issues affecting the elderly poor.
   ``The main reasons they don't apply are that they don't know
they can or they don't have the help they need to fill out the
application form.
   ``A safety net doesn't do any good hidden in a bureaucrat's
desk,'' added Pollack. ``You've got to get it out there, under the
people whose lives are falling.''
   The foundation based its conclusions on interviews with 6,214
elderly people at community meal sites in 15 states and on
interviews with staffers at 31 district Social Security offices and
358 community organizations serving the elderly.
   It was not designed as an academic study and did not seek to
ensure that the 6,214 elderly people questioned were a
scientifically drawn survey of elderly people eligible for the
program.
   Given those parameters, the survey found that:
   _Only 33 percent knew SSI could increase an eligible person's
income.
   _More than 90 percent assumed, incorrectly, that having a low
paying job would automatically prevent an individual from receiving
SSI.
   _Half thought, incorrectly, that owning a house or car would
automatically bar an applicant from eligibility.
   _More than a third thought, incorrectly, that anyone receiving
regular Social Security benefits would be barred from also
collecting SSI.
   A third of the Social Security district office managers had no
staff to assign to outreach activities and 40 percent of the SSI
client contacts with the 358 community organizations were for help
filling out the 12-page application that asks 45 multiple-part
questions.
   Applicants, some of them frail and functionally illiterate, are
required to supply documentation of age, rent or mortgage payments,
employment status, living arrangements, assets, Social Security and
pension benefits, insurance and property ownership.

<HEAD>Carriage Breaks Down As Re-enactment Journey Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNT VERNON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The start of the bicentennial
celebration of George Washington's presidential inauguration went
off without a hitch. But not without a problem.
   A sparkling antique carriage carrying an actor portraying
Washington was less than 100 feet into the 250-mile trek from Mount
Vernon to New York City when it broke down Sunday. One of the
wheels hit a fence post and broke the main shaft connecting the
harnesses and the carriage.
   The shaky departure was the only problem during opening
festivities celebrating the bicentennial of Washington's
inauguration on April 30, 1789. The eight-day trip will take the
entourage to New York on April 23.
   The first inauguration will be recreated in New York City's
Federal Hall on the anniversary date.
   ``It is far more, far more indeed, than a re-enactment and a
celebration of a 7{-day trip,'' former U.S. Supreme Court Chief
Justice Warren E. Burger told the crowd of about 3,000. ``This is a
trip, a journey that has lasted 200 years, and God willing, will
last for many hundreds of years in the future.''
   Burger, chairman of the Bicentennial Commission, opened the
ceremony with the dedication of a 25-cent stamp bearing the
likeness of Washington in honor of the bicentennial of the
executive branch of the government.
   One spectator in particular was moved by the performance.
   ``This is something very special for me,'' said Josephine
Thomas, 67, of Gulfstream, Fla., who said she is a Washington
descendent. ``This is one of the foremost families in the history
of America. To think that any of those genes are in my body gives
me something to look up to and to strive to emulate.''
   About half the journey is to be made by carriage.
   The trip will take the entourage through the District of
Columbia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.
   In his role as Washington, actor William Sommerfield began the
journey by greeting an actor playing the role of Secretary of
Congress Charles Thomson. Thomson arrived at Mount Vernon on April
16, 1789, with the news of Washington's election. Washington
immediately left for New York City _ but not without apprehensions.
   ``No one has filled this great office before,'' he said. ``Each
thing I do will be a precedent.''
   Just as Washington before him, Sommerfield left by carriage, but
after it the post the actor jumped into a van.
   ``Strange vehicle, strange vehicle,'' said Washington of his
first automobile ride. ``In the war, the unexpected was the
expected.''

   Authorities discovered two more bodies
Sunday buried on a collective farm two miles south of a ranch where
13 victims of a cult of human sacrifice were found last week.
   Investigators said they have evidence the male victims were
killed by the same drug smuggling cult suspected of performing
human sacrifices on the 13 males discovered Tuesday at Rancho Santa
Elena, about 20 miles west of Matamoros.
   Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez said the victims found Sunday
were connected to the drug smuggling operations of the cult, but
were not victims of the cult's rites as were the other 13.
   Unlike the bodies uncovered at Rancho Santa Elena, the bodies
found on the farm were not mutilated, said Mexican federal police
group chief Martin Elias Salazar.
   Acting on a tip from some children, a 72-year-old man led police
Sunday to the common grave in a clearing in an orchard on the farm,
Ejido Santa Librada, Salazar told reporters.
   The dead were identified as Moises Castillo Vasquez, the son of
the man who led police to the site, and Hector de la Fuente, also
known as ``El Guero'', or ``The Blond.'' Both were killed by
machete chops to the back of the head, said Jose Degadillo, an
employee at Funerales Rosario. Some of the victims found on the
ranch last week also were killed by machete chops.
   ``It was a revenge type killing. It was a drug deal gone sour,''
Perez said. The sheriff said the men apparently died in May. He
said he knew about the men because of an ongoing investigation into
the drug smuggling ring.
   However, a spokeswoman for the federal judicial police in
Matamoros said the two men were farmhands who had been missing
since last May.
   The children told the 72-year-old man, Hidalgo Castillo, that
they had seen some people burying a body in an orchard last
October, Salazar said. Castillo's son, Moises, 52, disappeared last
May. Salazar said Castillo had discounted the children's tale until
the 13 bodies were dug up.
   The two bodies were stacked and appeared to be those of adults,
investigators said. Neither had been positively identified as of
Sunday night.
   Officials disinterred the second body just before sunset Sunday.
Salazar searched through the pockets of a pair of black pants found
on the second body and discovered 3,000 Mexican pesos and a $5 bill.
   Four suspects arrested in the slayings of the 13 discovered on
Rancho Santa Elena have told police they killed 13 or 14 people in
bizarre rites intended to protect a marijuana smuggling ring. Among
the victims were a 16-year-old boy and Mark Kilroy, missing since
March when he came here during spring break from the University of
Texas.
   Police said the suspects have been cooperative in pointing out
the bodies and had not mentioned burying anybody on Ejido Santa
Librada. Ejido means collective farm in Spanish.
   Officials said the group trafficked in drugs and believed the
human sacrifice would protect them from police. In Matamoros,
authorities found altars covered with black chicken feathers,
burned turtles, cigars and other occult offerings. The bodies had
been mutilated, some with their hearts or brains ripped out.
   Police in Mexico and the United States are seeking alleged
ringleader Adolfo Constanzo and three others, including Sara
Aldrete, a college student identified as the ``godmother'' of the
cult.
   In a related development, Notimex, the Mexican government news
agency, reported Saturday that a woman identifying herself as Sara
Aldrete Villareal called a local radio station threatening to
kidnap children as hostages and burn them if the four prisoners
were not released.
   The news agency said local police in Matamoros dismissed the
report as a hoax.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Senate approved a bill to let
Staten Island residents vote on whether to secede from New York
City.
   The bill was introduced after the U.S. Supreme Court's
declaration in March that the city's powerful Board of Estimate,
which rules on spending and projects, violated the principle of one
man, one vote.
   Staten Island, the city's smallest borough with about 400,000
residents, has an equal presence on the board as the other four
boroughs, including Brooklyn with 2.2 million residents.
   ``There are 41 nations in the United Nations with less people
than Staten Island,'' Sen. John Marchi said after Sunday night's
vote.
   ``Who could be against one man, one vote, but it has to
accommodate the human condition,'' said the Staten Island
Republican, who sponsored the bill.
   The measure was approved 34-1 without debate in the
Republican-controlled Senate. It is given little chance of approval
in the Assembly, which is dominated by Democrats from the city's
more populous boroughs.

<HEAD>Kemp Moves To Make Drug-related Evictions Easier in Federal Housing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is making illegal drug
use or sales a specific violation of public housing leases as a way
to ease the eviction process for local authorities.
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp announced the step Sunday as he
released a report describing actions public housing authorities
around the country are already taking to solve drug-related
problems.
   In a prepared statement, the secretary of Housing and Urban
Development said HUD would also inform local housing authorities of
ways they can use already appropriated federal funds to make
physical and management improvements aimed at improving security
against drug crimes.
   He said HUD would publish a notice informing local housing
authorities that leases must include explicit provisions that allow
termination of the lease if any member of a household or person
under the tenant's control engages in drug-related criminal
activity.

<TEXT>
   Federal and local police say they capped a
two-year investigation by breaking up a drug cartel that brought as
much as 440 pounds of cocaine into the violence-torn Washington
area.
   Authorities arrested about two dozen people during a weekend
anti-drug sweep that netted the alleged leadership of a group that
controlled much of the cocaine market in the nation's capital.
   Among those arrested were Rayful Edmond Jr., 24, and Tony Lewis,
described as being in his mid-twenties. Officials said Sunday that
the two led a network that controlled up to 20 percent of the
cocaine and crack traffic in Washington.
   The Washington Post quoted sources as saying the pair's alleged
drug network employed more than 150 people and has been linked to
scores of homicides. The Post quoted sources as saying that more
than a year ago Edmond's alleged drug gang was generating income of
more than $300,000 a day.
   Edmond and Lewis were arrested Saturday on cocaine distribution
charges.
   The arrests resulted from a two-year joint investigation
conducted by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and
district police.

<NOTE>AIDS Research Funds Being Used for AZT Treatments</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of dollars intended for AIDS research
is instead being used to the drug AZT for needy AIDS patients
because Congress reauthorized the free drug program without
providing money for it.
   The program was to expire last September, but was extended
without an appropriation. Congressional leaders subsequently made
clear they expected Health and Human Services officials to tap
other AIDS accounts for the money.
   Although the program is authorized at $15 million for the
current fiscal year, the company that makes the drug _ Burroughs
Wellcome _ is picking up $5 million of the cost by making that much
of the drug available free.
   The remaining $10 million had to be found elsewhere in the HHS
budget. About $7.4 million comes from the National Institutes of
Health budget, and about $6 million of that from NIH research funds.

<HEAD>States Consider Laws Requiring Companies to Insure Workers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Poor-Insurance, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a list of some of the states considering legislation to
help workers who have no health insurance. Hawaii and Massachusetts
have laws requiring employers to insure their workers.
   _Alaska: A bill in the Senate would provide up to 10,000
uninsured people with state-subsidized health insurance. Lawmakers
also are considering a mandatory insurance bill based on
Massachusetts' law.
   _California: Five bills have been introduced, including one
requiring companies with five or more employees to provide health
care benefits. About 2.7 million workers are uninsured, or about
one out of 10 California residents.
   _Delaware: A measure pending in a Senate committee is aimed at
providing insurance for the indigent. Between 80,000 and 90,000
people are uninsured.
   _Florida: Legislators are considering a measure based on
Massachusetts' law, requiring employers to insure their employees.
An estimated 1 million to 2 million people, or one-sixth of
Florida's population, are uninsured.
   _Georgia: The General Assembly passed a measure creating a
high-risk health insurance pool that will arrange health insurance
for those who could not previously qualify for insurance. About 2
million people are uninsured.
   _Illinois: A bill would require businesses with five or more
employees to provide health benefits for employees who work more
than 17{ hours weekly. About 1.5 million Illinoisans have neither
private health insurance nor Medicaid, or more than 13 percent of
the state's 11 million people.
   _Indiana: The state General Assembly is considering a measure
that would create a commission to study the need for
state-sponsored health care services. Indiana has 769,000 people,
or about 17 percent of the population, with no insurance.
   _Iowa: A bill passed by a House committee creates a $200,000
study, eventually calling for businesses with 40 or more employees
to provide insurance coverage. About 350,000 people, or more than
10 percent of the state's population, are uninsured.
   _Kansas: A bill in the appropriations committee seeks to
establish an insurance ``buy-in'' program for workers who meet
poverty guidelines and whose employers do not provide coverage.
About 480,000 Kansans, or 14 percent of the state's population, are
uninsured.
   _Minnesota: Bills pending in the House and Senate aim to
guarantee that all Minnesotans have access to affordable health
insurance. About 400,000 people, or 9.3 percent of the state's
population, are uninsured.
   _New York: A pilot program will provide health insurance to
14,500 uninsured New Yorkers, mostly those unemployed or employees
of small companies. About 2.5 million people are uninsured, and 75
percent of them are working.
   _Ohio: A House bill would require insurance coverage for
low-paid workers with a 1 percent payroll tax on employers. About
1.4 million of Ohio's 11 million residents are uninsured.
   _Oklahoma: A bill seeks to provide `insurance of last resort''
to workers without health insurance. An estimated 636,800 people
are uninsured out of a population of 3.3 million.
   _Oregon: The Senate approved a bill that would revamp the
federal-state Medicaid program with the aim of covering more poor
people. About 400,000 people are uninsured, about 15 percent of
Oregon's population of 2.7 million.
   _South Carolina: Lawmakers are considering a measure that
creates an accident and health insurance pool to help uninsured
workers. About 440,000 of South Carolina's 3.1 million people are
working without insurance and are ineligible for Medicaid.
   _Vermont: Lawmakers are considering a plan to help small
companies provide health insurance to their workers. About 31,000
of Vermont's 550,000 residents are uninsured.
   _Virginia: The General Assembly passed a $14.8 million program
to provide medical care for those with little or no health
insurance. About 880,000 of Virginia's 5.9 million residents have
little or no insurance.
   _Washington: The state's five-year Basic Health pilot project
provides health care to the ``working poor'' who are not covered by
welfare programs. About 720,000 people, or 16 percent of
Washington's residents, are uninsured.

<HEAD>Biography: JFK Left Behind Nuclear Codes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Kennedy once sneaked away for a sexual
liaison without telling the Secret Service and without taking the
list of codes he needed in the event of a nuclear attack, a new
book says.
   The book also says that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, in a
telephone conversation with Marilyn Monroe, offered to divorce the
president if the actress would agree to marry him and move into the
White House.
   The biography by C. David Heymann, ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' was
to be serialized beginning today in the weekly Star, a supermarket
tabloid.
   The Star reports in its April 18 edition that later excerpts
will include disclosures about amphetamine use by the Kennedys in
the White House.
   Heymann, also author of ``Poor Little Rich Girl: The Life and
Legend of Barbara Hutton,'' said that he obtained Secret Service,
FBI and CIA files through the Freedom of Information Act and that
he and his researchers conducted 825 interviews. He also had access
to the former first lady's White House social files.
   Mrs. Onassis' spokeswoman, Nancy Tuckerman, said Friday that
Mrs. Onassis had no comment.
   The charges about Kennedy sneaking away from the Secret Service
were made by Langdon Marvin Jr., a former defense consultant to
Kennedy.
   The book said Marvin and Kennedy sneaked out of the Hotel
Carlyle in New York to attend a party at a townhouse across the
street.
   ``Within minutes, Jack had made his choice of partner and gone
off with her to her apartment. Moments later, the Secret Service
arrived. Where was the president? Nobody knew. The agent paled.
   ``On the street in front of the townhouse stood an Army
lieutenant with an attache case handcuffed to his wrist. Jack was
off making love, and the bagman with the black satchel had been
left behind.
   ``The Russians could have bombed us to hell and back, and there
would have been nothing we could have done about it,'' Marvin was
quoted as saying.
   The date of the alleged incident was not given. Marvin died in
1987, according to Sandra Bodner, a spokeswoman for the publisher,
Lyle Stuart.
   ``We are not aware of any material that would support that
allegation,'' said Frank Rigg, a spokesman for the John F. Kennedy
Library in Boston.
   Kennedy also had illicit sexual liaisons on the night of his
inauguration and before the Nixon debates, the book said.
   Miss Monroe, who has been romantically linked with the
president, told Kennedy's brother-in-law Peter Lawford that she had
called Mrs. Kennedy at the White House, according to the first part
of the series.
   ``According to Marilyn, Jackie wasn't shaken by the call. Not
outwardly. She agreed to step aside. She would divorce Jack, and
Marilyn could marry him, but she would have to move into the White
House. If Marilyn wasn't prepared to live openly in the White
House, she might as well forget about it,'' Lawford was quoted as
saying.
   ``Actually, Jackie was infuriated by the call, and for some
reason blamed Frank Sinatra for it. She couldn't easily blame me
because I was family, so she took it out on him. Sinatra was no
longer welcome at the White House, or in any of the other Kennedy
bastions,'' said Lawford, who since has died.

<TEXT>
   A soccer-mad city poured out its grief
for 94 dead at two of its prominent shrines _ the modern Roman
Catholic cathedral and the home field of Liverpool football club.
   In the early hours today, people were still coming to the main
gate of Anfield Road stadium, converging on a 100-foot expanse of
steel fence and gate covered with clusters of flowers, club
banners, scarves and hats.
   ``They only wanted to see their heroes ... '' began one long
epitaph taped to the fence honoring Liverpool fans who died in a
human crush Saturday at Hillsborough stadium 65 miles away in
Sheffield.
   At the gate, a memorial to legendary manager Bill Shankly
adorned with the motto ``You Will Never Walk Alone,'' a man and
woman stood locked together in love and grief, barely moving for
more than half an hour while the woman's sobbing never ceased.
   Many others could be heard crying but few spoke.
   ``We're all so close. Everyone knows someone who died,'' said
Jason Travers, 20, who had come to put up a card for a 16-year-old
friend who died in Sheffield.
   ``So sad, so sad,'' a strapping young man said brokenly as he
walked along the barrier. Another clenched a fist and cried out
``Why?''
   With the adjoining street closed to traffic, sometimes the only
sound was people crying or the footfalls of people coming and going.
   At the Metropolitan Cathedral, which was filled to overflowing
for an ecumenical requiem Mass, the red banner of Liverpool
Football Club stood near the altar.
   At the Anglican Cathedral, the Bell of Great George tolled 94
times. Customarily rung for the death of a monarch, the bell's deep
tone had last been heard on May 29, 1985, ringing for the 39 mostly
Italian fans killed in a riot involving Liverpool fans at a Belgian
stadium.
   Liverpool's match on Wednesday against West Ham United has been
canceled. ``It is our view that all football matches involving our
club should be suspended for the time being,'' club chairman John
Smith said Sunday.
   But the Anfield stadium was open during the day and fans came to
place flowers on the ``Kop,'' the terrace behind one of the goals
where thousands of fiercely loyal fans congregate.
   It was on a similar but smaller terrace at Sheffield that the 94
fans died. ``You Will Never Walk Alone,'' a song known to every fan
on the Kop, was repeated on many of the messages left at the gate.
   Among the messages was one from a survivor, ``To those who
carried me from the goalmouth yesterday, you never knew me but I'll
never forget you.''
   Other expressions of sympathy were left by fans of Liverpool's
other big-league football club, Everton. In many families, children
grow up with split loyalties to the red and white of Liverpool and
the blue and white of Everton.
   Liverpool is by far the more successful club _ four times
European champion and a record 17 times English League winner _ but
the rivalry with Everton is respectful and friendly.
   Everton qualified Saturday for the final of the premier English
F.A. (Football Association) Cup, its third final in six years.
Soccer authorities will decide this week if and when to replay
Liverpool's semifinal game.

   Vietnam's leader will go to Moscow this
week for talks with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev that are
expected to center on Vietnam's planned pullout from Cambodia,
Japan's Kyodo news agency reported today.
   The four-day visit by Communist Party chief Nguyen Van Linh
begins Thursday, the agency said in a dispatch from Vietnam's
capital of Hanoi.
   Linh then will travel to Cuba, another staunch Vietnam ally,
said the report, which quoted unidentified government sources.
   Linh was among a group of pragmatists who took over the top
party ranks at the sixth national party congress in late 1986. His
administration has said Vietnam must resolve the Cambodia issue in
order to end its diplomatic isolation and attract aid to rebuild
its economy.
   Vietnam announced April 5 it will withdraw all its troops from
Cambodia by Sept. 30, leaving the government it installed in that
country after intervening 10 years ago to forge a political
settlement with the resistance guerrilla groups.

<HEAD>More States Debate Ways to Insure the Working Poor</HEAD>

   At least a dozen states are considering laws that would force
companies to insure their employees as a way to stem billions of
dollars in hospital losses and protect some of the 37 million
Americans without health insurance.
   Hawaii in 1974 became the first state in the nation to adopt a
mandatory insurance law, and it was followed last year by
Massachusetts.
   This year, California, Florida, Illinois, Ohio and other states
are debating bills that would order companies to cover workers,
impose tax penalties on those that don't and provide incentives for
those that do.
   New York, Washington and a few other states have adopted pilot
projects to provide health care to the working poor.
   And last week in Washington, D.C., Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., introduced federal
legislation that would require employers to buy health insurance
for all full-time workers. Similar legislation failed last year.
   ``It is time to make health care a basic right for all, not just
an expensive privilege for the few,'' Kennedy said.
   More than 37 million Americans lack health insurance; about
two-thirds _ 24 million _ are workers or their families. Their
numbers have grown about 1 million a year since 1980, their ranks
swelled by workers who once held well-paying factory jobs and now
work in the service industry.
   Hospitals have been prime supporters of the effort on the state
and federal levels to insure the poor. Small businesses oppose
mandatory insurance, saying they cannot afford to provide health
care benefits.
   In 1980, hospitals lost $2.8 billion in health care costs for
which they received no reimbursement, or about 3.6 percent of their
total costs, said Irene Fraser, a health project manager with the
American Hospital Association in Chicago.
   Seven years later, losses for treating the poor rose to $7.2
billion, or 4.7 percent of total hospital costs, she said.
   Many workers are unable to pay their bills because their
employers provide no insurance and they earn just enough to be
ineligible for assistance through Medicaid, which has wage ceilings
that vary from state to state.
   According to the National Governors Association, a family of
three in Alabama could earn only $1,416 per year to be eligible for
Medicaid, while the same family in Utah could earn $8,316.
   Fifteen years after Hawaii passed its mandatory insurance law,
opinions differ on the program's success, and its applicability to
mainland states.
   ``I would say to anyone looking, don't use Hawaii as an example
because it's a poor example,'' said Sam Slom, president of Small
Business Hawaii. ``Neither employees or employers are satisfied.''
   Employees are offered health insurance if they work at least 20
hours a week for four consecutive weeks. The law excludes
government employees, family businesses and people who work on
commission, such as real estate agents.
   Employees pay 1.5 percent of their monthly wage, or one-half the
cost of the insurance premium, whichever is less, and the employer
pays the balance.
   ``We think it's working well. The employers are attuned to the
law and comply,'' said Tomio Anzai, chief of the Prepaid Health
Care Branch of the state Department of Labor and Industrial
Relations.
   Hawaii's law wouldn't work elsewhere, said Jim Weidman,
Washington, D.C., manager of state media relations for the National
Federation of Independent Businesses.
   ``I would hasten to point out that Hawaii is neither a mainland
nor a mainstream state,'' he said. ``It's more like Disneyland.
It's easier to gouge tourists who will have to pay more for
everything from macadamia nuts to shoeshines.''
   Debra Lipson, senior research associate at George Washington
University's InterGovernmental Health Policy Project, agreed that
Hawaii is a special case.
   ``You've got a unique situation in Hawaii,'' she said. ``If
(small companies) decide the cost of doing business is too high,
they can't just jump over to the next state.''
   Last year, Massachusetts went a step further with a law
providing health security both to workers and the unemployed.
   The program, aimed at the one in 10 people in Massachusetts who
have no insurance, is being installed in phases and will take full
effect in 1992. The program could cost up to $1 billion over four
years.
   Minnesota lawmakers are considering a measure that would provide
basic health coverage to the poor, with its $150 million cost paid
by a payroll tax on employees and employers. Companies providing
insurance could get tax breaks.

<HEAD>Magazine Gives Details of Soviets Worst Space Disaster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magazine has published details of the worst
disaster in the Soviets' space program, indirectly blaming the
deadly launchpad explosion of an unmanned missile in 1960 on haste
to catch up with the United States.
   The weekly Ogonyok said in an article Sunday that workers
ignored safety rules in the rush to launch the first Soviet
intercontinental ballistic missile in the race with the United
States to develop ICBMs.
   It said ``a significant number'' of people perished in the
explosion and fireball of the R-16 missile at a launching pad at
Tura-Tam near the Aral Sea.
   The only victim identified by Ogonyok was Chief Artillery
Marshal Mitrofan I. Nedelin, serving as the first commander of the
newly created Soviet rocket forces. It said he was about 60 feet
from the missile when it exploded.
   The late Nikita S. Khrushchev, who was premier at the time of
the accident, said in memoirs published in the West that dozens of
soldiers and workers were killed.
   Accounts of the disaster on Oct. 24, 1960, have circulated
abroad but Ogonyok's report was the first in the official Soviet
media.
   It said:
   Launch of the R-16, which was to be the maiden flight of the
Soviets' first ICBM, had been scheduled for Oct. 23 but was
postponed because of an electrical defect in the engine that caused
a fuel leak.
   In one of the ``gravest violations of safety precautions'' the
hatches were removed and welding work undertaken on the fully
fueled rocket.
   Late the next day the launch was scheduled in 30 minutes but
workers were still installing an electrical distributor that
somehow gave a command to ignite the rocket's second stage.
   Flames from the ignition burned through the fuel tanks of the
first stage, touching off the fire and explosion.
   Ogonyok quoted a worker as saying, ``A stream of fire burst out
of the rocket, inundating everything around it. People tried to
escape by running to the covered area where cars and other
equipment were, but the road literally melted in front of them,
blocking the escape route.''
   The magazine said the heat was so intense ``practically nothing
was left _ only some metal change, keys, etc.''
   In another development, the official Tass news agency said
Saturday that scientists have abandoned efforts to re-establish
contact with an unmanned satellite sent to examine Mars. That meant
the Soviets have lost touch with both Phobos spacecraft launched at
a cost of $480 million.
   Tass said the decision to discontinue attempts to reach Phobos-2
was made by a commission investigating why contact had been lost
March 27. Contact with the Phobos-1 Mars probe was lost in
September because an erroneous command was beamed to the spacecraft
from Earth.
   For many years the official news media did not report failures
in the Soviet space program.
   Ogonyok said it now was possible to report the circumstances of
the R-16 disaster because of the greater openness permitted under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's glasnost campaign.

   The halter created by design student
Beth Teggatz doesn't cover a lot of flesh, but it packs a lot of
protection.
   The top and matching knee-length pants and gauntlet-style gloves
are made of a bulletproof, fire-resistant material, Kevlar 29.
   ``I don't think there are any practical uses, unless Cher might
be interested, or maybe a punk rock group,'' said Teggatz, a senior
at Iowa State University.
   But practicality is beside the point. The halter will be among
many unusual items going on display next week at Focus, the
university's annual arts festival that prizes the creative over the
marketable.
   ``The idea is to show that at this highly technical institution
there are quite a few original ideas,'' said Pat Miller,
coordinator of the exhibit at the school known mainly for business,
engineering and agricultural studies.
   Ms. Teggatz, 22, says her halter will be displayed on a
mannequin, although real live models have given it a try. ``They
have laughed, but they've been pretty agreeable,'' she said.
   Ms. Teggatz also will display a wedding dress made from
radiation-resistant fabric.
   ``It's really quite sturdy,'' she said. ``The material is thin
like paper, but it doesn't rip. It's quite easy to work with.''
   The material, which like the Kevlar is made by Du Pont, is used
for garments worn by workers in nuclear plants. After exposure to
radiation, the garment is discarded.
   ``I've had people tell me that since the wedding dress is almost
a papery-like substance that would get thrown away after use, maybe
it could be used for all the disposable weddings in society
anymore,'' she said.
   Ms. Teggatz cherishes the opportunity to stretch her creativity
to bizarre extremes while she can.
   ``I'll have to settle down soon enough,'' she said. ``You can't
make money being too creative.''

<HEAD>Hard-Nosed Salinas Fights Corruption That Threatens His Power</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By having Mexico's reputed No. 1 drug lord
arrested, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari again surprised
cynics who had initially considered his pledge to fight high-level
corruption an empty campaign promise.
   In what amounted to a coup against the oil workers union,
Salinas used the army to arrest allegedly corrupt union leaders in
January.
   He jailed stockbrokers accused of fraudulent practices a month
later.
   This month, alleged drug kingpin Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo was
arrested.
   It is all part of Salinas' battle to regain the confidence of
Mexicans who blame corruption for seven years of lost economic
opportunity.
   If he fails, some analysts say, his Institutional Revolutionary
Party could lose its hold on power. Such observers hold that
Salinas has been on the attack since taking office Dec. 1 because
he has no choice.
   ``Salinas has to go against his own government, its own
collaborators, to regain legitimacy. He realizes that if the
patronage system continues, it's going to collapse in upon
itself,'' said Samuel del Villar, a political scientist at the
Colegio de Mexico and adviser to Salinas' predecessor, former
President Miguel de la Madrid.
   Salinas' election in July was the most disputed in the history
of the party, which has governed Mexico since it was founded 60
years ago. He won just more than half the vote, but reports
abounded of multiple voting, stolen ballot boxes and other fraud.
   ``The results of July 6 were as much a rebellion against
corruption as they were against the government,'' del Villar said.
   Salinas faces a skeptical public; every Mexican president in
recent decades has come into office boldly declaring their
intention to battle corruption.
   He has inherited cynicism over the failure of his predecessors
to tackle corruption fueled by the oil-boom years. Many still
bitterly criticize Jose Lopez Portillo, claiming he and his allies
stole the country blind _ claims Portillo denies.
   He was followed in 1982 by de la Madrid, ``the last president
who held public confidence that he could confront corruption, and
he lost it,'' del Villar said.
   De la Madrid's campaign for honest government failed, ``so
corruption spread extraordinarily,'' del Villar said.
   Salinas has been forced to attack the very elements that, with
PRI patronage, have kept the party in power.
   Oil union chief Joaquin Hernandez Galicia and stockbroker
Eduardo Legoretta were considered untouchable before Salinas jailed
them.
   In drug trafficking havens, top dealers were sometimes called
``narco-politicians'' _ before April 8, when Salinas had Felix
Gallardo thrown in jail.
   He also had army troops arrest hundreds of police in Felix
Gallardo's home town of Culiacan, sweeping up officials who
allegedly protected the so-called ``godfather'' of Mexico's cocaine
trade.
   Salinas' threat to follow up those arrests with more in other
states where drug trafficking is strong sent dozens of law
enforcement officials scurrying for cover, according to news
reports.
   ``De la Madrid went after marginal people; Salinas is going for
the central figures,'' del Villar said.
   Salinas is up against a centuries-old mix of corruption that has
infested Mexico's traditional authoritarian structure of government.
   In his recent ``La Capital: The Biography of Mexico City,''
Jonathan Kandell writes of the turn-of-the-century:
   ``Gendarmes were forced to prey on the poor in order to cover
kickbacks demanded from them by their higher officers. That system
continues today, with cars with U.S. license plates favored targets
for a quick shakedown.''
   Decades later, Mexico City police Chief Arturo Durazo recruited
known drug traffickers, smugglers and car thieves to create ``a
more proficient racketeering empire,'' Kandell says.
   Salinas also has staked his presidency _ and the continuation of
his party's claim to authority _ on his ability to pull Mexico out
of seven years of economic crisis that has sliced paychecks in half.
   ``Corruption is worst where the economic activity is most
strategic,'' del Villar said.
   He said Salinas, a Harvard-educated economist, jailed Legoretta
and Hernandez Galicia because ``the brokerage firms, like the oil
workers union, weren't filling a productive role in the economy.''
   Indeed, Mexican officials hope to gain billions of dollars in
extra profits from a more efficient, less corrupt petroleum
industry.
   Salinas' crackdowns have earned Salinas kudos from the Bush
administration, whose help he needs to reduce Mexico's
growth-strangling $107 billion foreign debt.
   ``His credibility in Washington has soared,'' says political
scientist Adolfo Aguilar Zinser.
   Whether that translates into electoral gains at home remains to
be seen.
   Still, Salinas' campaign has impressed even some cynics.
   ``The surprising thing about the arrests ... isn't that certain
police are accused of corruption, but that they're being punished
for it,'' wrote political scientist Lorenzo Meyer in the Mexico
City daily Excelsior.

   A winery worker sought in the killings
of his wife, two daughters and four other people was an angry,
jealous man who spied on his wife and had threatened ``to blow her
head off,'' a friend said.
   Ramon Salcido, 28, was so possessive of his wife that he drove
home from work several times a day to check on her, said Richard
Clark, Salcido's next-door neighbor in Boyes Hot Springs and friend.
   Authorities on Sunday concentrated their search for Salcido
north of San Francisco and alerted the U.S. Border Patrol, fearing
he could head for his native Mexico.
   ``The cost of this is substantial, but we'll pay anything to get
this man into custody,'' said Sonoma County Sheriff Richard
Michaelsen. ``His acts are those of a totally insane person.''
   On Sunday, the owners of the Grand Cru Winery where Salcido
worked as a forklift operator offered a $5,000 reward for
information leading to his capture.
   ``These atrocities have caused fear and terror to invade an area
known for its beauty and hospitality,'' Walter and Bettina Dreyer
said in a statement.
   On Friday, officers discovered the bodies of Salcido's
24-year-old wife, Angela, at their home; his mother-in-law and her
two young daughters at their home in Cotati; and a winery
co-worker. The girls had been raped and sodomized, and one was
nearly decapitated, authorities said.
   The next day, the bodies of two of Salcido's daughters were
found at a dump with their throats slashed. The throat of his
3-year-old daughter, Carmina, also was cut but she survived and
told police her father had done the slashings.
   On Tuesday, only three days before her death, his wife learned
he had been married before and had another child born only a short
time before their own oldest daughter, the Los Angeles Times
reported today.
   After learning of her husband's other life, Mrs. Salcido said
she wanted to leave him, the newspaper said.
   ```Now I can get an annulment,''' next-door neighbor Steve
Nielsen quoted Mrs. Salcido as saying.
   Salcido also was a regular seller and user of cocaine and
possibly amphetamines, the Times reported, quoting several of his
acquaintances it did not indentify by name.
   On Thursday night, Salcido stayed out drinking until 2 a.m.,
then snorted cocaine with a friend, the newspaper said.
   Sheriff's investigators said detectives had no information that
Salcido sold drugs.
   Clark described Salcido as being extremely jealous. ``Anybody
who was higher up than him or if he had a nicer car than he did _
he didn't like that. He wanted to be No. 1,'' Clark said.
   He also said the Salcidos had recently begun arguing loudly.
   Once, he said, he heard Mrs. Salcido, an aspiring model, cry
out, ``Living with you is like living in jail! You won't let me go
out!''
   ``I could hear them yelling. ... I guess I knew (the killings)
were coming. I heard him say, `I'm going to blow your head off,'''
Clark said.
   ``He blew up _ I had a feeling he would,'' said Clark. ``He told
me he had a gun and he was ready to use it if he ever needed.''
   Salcido also was upset recently because he was served papers
ordering him to pay nearly $6,000 in overdue child support and to
make monthly payments of $511 for a 4-year-old daughter in Fresno,
Clark said.
   Despite reports of Salcido's having problems at work, his boss,
Dreyer, remembered him as ``very cooperative'' and ``quick to
please.''
   ``He never caused any problems for anybody,'' said Warren
Brunhagen, a patron at McNeilly's bar in Boyes Hot Springs, where
Salcido was a regular customer.
   ``If we had had 30 bar patrons like Ramon, there'd be no
problems.''
   Investigators still have not determined a motive for the
slayings and haven't worked out their sequence, Michaelsen said.
   ``We hope the young daughter of the suspect can put some light
on it,'' the sheriff said.
   Money and gifts poured into a hospital where Carmina was
recovering from surgery.
   ``I've been told she'll make a full recovery. It was reported to
me her vocal cords were not cut,'' Michaelsen said.

   In one blood-drenched day, terror
struck the lush, rolling hills of this famous wine-producing region
as seven people were either shot to death, bludgeoned or had their
throats slashed.
   Ramon Salcido, 28, is being sought in the carnage that included
his wife and two young daughters, his mother-in-law and two of her
daughters, and a winery co-worker. One of his daughters, 3-year-old
Carmina Salcido, survived despite her throat being cut nearly
ear-to-ear.
   The search continued today for Salcido, whom authorities and
neighbors described as an insanely jealous, gun-toting drinker who
had problems at home and at work.
   Authorities still do not know the sequence of the killings, but
this is how the Sonoma County sheriff's department responded:
   _8:15 a.m. Friday: deputies received a 911 emergency call from
Kenneth Butti, 33, who reported that Salcido shot him in the
shoulder at his home in Kenwood.
   Butti, a bottling supervisor at the Grand Cru Winery, where
Salcido worked as a forklift operator, was treated at a hospital
and released.
   _9 a.m.: Officers who arrived at the winery near Butti's home
found Tracey Toovey, 35, an assistant winemaker, slumped halfway
out of the door of his car on a dirt access road to the winery,
dead of multiple gunshot wounds to his head.
   Other deputies were dispatched to Salcido's home a few miles
south in a lower middle-income neighborhood. They found Salcido's
wife, 24-year-old Angela, in a blood-splattered hallway. Deputies
said she had been shot a few times and beaten.
   _9:30 a.m.: Deputies were sent to the home of Salcido's in-laws
in Cotati, where they made the most grisly discovery yet. Amid more
blood-splattered walls and floors were three bodies. Marian Louise
Richards, 47, was dead in the hallway. Her 12-year-old daughter,
Ruth, was dead in the kitchen, and another daughter, 8-year-old
Marie, was dead in a bedroom. Both girls were sexually molested,
sodomized, and one of the children was nearly decapitated,
authorities said.
   Sonoma County Sheriff Dick Michaelsen called the scene ``a
slaughterhouse.''
   Neighbors reported hearing shouts of ``no, no'' coming from the
Richards' house, but no sound was heard after 7 a.m.
   Authorities launched a manhunt for Salcido, who was spotted in
his car with his own three children by a school bus driver. An
all-points bulletin was issued.
   _4 p.m.: The sheriff held a news conference and said he feared
for the lives of the girls, aged 1, 3 and 4. Salcido's ex-wife and
daughter in Fresno were alerted and taken into protective custody.
   Salcido reportedly was upset because he was served with child
support papers Tuesday from Frenso County Superior Court, ordering
him to pay $511 a month in child support payments and nearly $6,000
to the county for back support.
   _6 p.m.: Salcido's abandoned car was found in an industrial area
of San Rafael. Authorities found a .22-caliber semi-automatic
handgun inside.
   _2:30 p.m. Saturday: A man peering over an embankment at a
county dump southeast of Petaluma, spotted what he believed were
dolls _ until he noticed one of the figures moving. He alerted
police. Authorities found the bodies of two of Salcido's daughters,
Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1. Carmina was alive.
   The girls' throats had been slashed. Michaelsen later disclosed
that Carmina said her father attacked the girls and left them for
dead.
   _5:30 p.m.: Carmina came out of two hours of surgery in serious
but stable condition.
   _Sunday, noon: Michaelsen said that although authorities had
been notified throughout the state, the search for Salcido was
centered on Sonoma County and San Rafael, where Salcido left his
car on Friday.
   ``We want him. We want him now,'' Michaelsen said. ``Anybody is
in danger at this point. He has the potential to take another life
without batting an eye.''

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Says Army Opposed Using Troops To Quell Protest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over the objections of the regional army
commander, political leaders ordered troops to break up a
pro-independence rally in Soviet Georgia, Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze was quoted as saying.
   At least 19 people were killed in the April 9 clash in the
Georgian capital, Tbilisi.
   In the Baltic republic of Lithuania, thousands rallied Sunday to
mourn the victims. And at a rally in Moscow, human rights activist
Andrei D. Sakharov led about 500 people in a minute of silence for
the dead.
   In a report Sunday, Pravda quoted Shevardnadze as saying the
curfew in the southern republic could be lifted today.
   Tbilisi has generally been quiet, though tense, since the
deaths. An 11 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew imposed after the
demonstrations has been cut back to midnight to 5 a.m., local
activist Sergei Dandurov said by telephone.
   During the unrest, Shevardnadze said the army ``marched and was
stationed in certain places under orders given by the leadership of
the republic,'' the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported.
   Shevardnadze said the decision to use troops to quell the
protests was opposed by Col. Gen. I.N. Rodionov, commander of a
region that includes Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.
   ``The commander said the function the troops were ordered to
perform was not the responsibility of the army,'' Pravda quoted
Shevardnadze as saying in a speech Friday to the Georgian Communist
Party's Central Committee.
   On Friday, the republic's party chief resigned after accepting
responsibility for the April 9 clash in a main square of Tbilisi,
and the republic's premier was also fired as a result.
   Shevardnadze was sent to the region to help restore order. He is
a native Georgian and former chief of the republic's Communist
Party.
   State-run Radio Moscow said 20 people died and more than 150
were injured in the April 9 clashe. The official Georgian news
agency Gruzinform said the death toll remained at 19.
   In Tbilisi, residents turned out Sunday for the final two
funerals for the victims, said Gruzinform's deputy director, Zurab
Lomidze.
   About 30,000 people rallied Sunday in the Lithanian city of
Vilnius in memory of the dead, according to Valdas Anelauskas, a
local journalist for the dissident paper Express-Khronika.
   Speaking in a telephone interview, he reported that protesters
carried banners saying, ``The Soviet Army is a band of
headchoppers'' and ``Let the bloody communist system be cursed.''
   No arrests or violence were reported.
   Sakharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said during the
Moscow rally that he blamed the bloodshed in Tbilisi on measures
adopted last summer in Moscow requiring advance permission for
demonstrations.
   Sakharov, who is running for a seat in the new Congress of
People's Deputies, said he would fight to revoke the decrees if
elected.
   The Soviet Union has witnessed a resurgence of regional
nationalism under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The nationalists
often profess to back Gorbachev's social and political reforms
while demanding more autonomy or even secession from Moscow.

   Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who
wrote the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion and will hear arguments
next week on a challenge to that decision, said he's been getting
lots of mail on the subject.
   Blackmun, appearing at a symposium Saturday night, refused to
comment on the possibility that the Supreme Court this term could
overturn the decision that resulted from Roe vs. Wade.
   The high court is scheduled to hear arguments in Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services on April 26. The case involves a
federal appeals court ruling that struck down key provisions of a
Missouri anti-abortion law declaring that human life begins at
conception.
   Last September, Blackmun told law students at the University of
Arkansas, ``there's a very distinct possibility'' that Roe vs. Wade
will be overturned by the high court because ``you can count the
votes.''
   The associate justice said Saturday night he had been getting
``voluminous'' mail on the subject, with some people branding him
``morally rotten'' and ``responsible for the deaths of more babies
in the history of world.''
   Asked about his philosophy of law, Blackmun said, ``I think we
need some compassion in judgments. Let me just leave (my
constitutional philosophy) at that.''
   The symposium marked the 50th anniversary of the late William O.
Douglas' appointment to the high court. Douglas served longer than
any other justice in U.S. history. The symposium also came on the
19th anniversary of Blackmun's appointment. They were on the bench
together for five years.
   Douglas was an ``extremely talented'' person ``with love of the
environment, veneration of the First Amendment, ease of writing,
lack of pomposity,'' Blackmun said.
   ``I saw Douglas as a person with whom I had to get along,''
Blackmun added. ``He put me on the defensive because of his
accomplishments.''
   Blackmun said his constitutional philosophy has developed in his
years on the court, but still holds the opinions he held before his
appointment.
   ``If one reads my opinions in the (U.S.) Court of Appeals, I
think you'll find I haven't changed ... (though) I suppose I've
changed in the sense that I've tried to develop a constitutional
philosophy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Voters Uphold Amnesty For Troops Under Military Rule; Reject Prosecution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a nationwide referendum,
Uruguayans voted to retain an amnesty for soldiers and police
accused of torture and murder during 12 years of military rule that
ended in 1985, official returns showed today.
   The outcome of Sunday's vote was a victory for President Julio
M. Sanguinetti on an issue that had divided the nation for more
than two years.
   He had predicted trouble if the amnesty, approved in 1986 after
rumblings in the barracks, were rejected. Soldiers who faced
similar prosecution in neighboring Argentina have staged three
revolts in less than two years.
   With 7,009 of 7,072 districts nationwide reporting, amnesty
supporters tallied 1,008,925 votes, or 52.57 percent, while
opponents numbered 770,221 or 40.13 percent. About 140,049 votes,
or 7.3 percent, were blank, annulled or ruled questionable for
technical reasons.
   Uruguay ``definitely has turned the page on the past,'' a
relieved Vice President Enrique Tarigo said as the Interior
Ministry released official returns early today. ``There were no
winners or losers.''
   About 180 soldiers and police had been accused of crimes during
the dictatorship's war against leftist rebels. Thousands of
suspected leftist sympathizers were arrested and tortured, 150 were
killed and 200 were never seen again.
   The governing Colorado Party noted that in addition to the
December 1986 amnesty for soldiers and police, leftist Tupamaro
guerrillas were released from jail shortly after Sanguinetti took
office in March 1985.
   Early today a co-president of the National Commission for a
Referendum, a coalition of human rights and leftist political
groups that collected more than a half-million signatures to bring
about the referendum, conceded defeat.
   But a disheartened Matilde Rodriguez Larreta, whose politician
husband was assassinated by security forces in 1976, also called
for a ``national compromise'' on the issue.
   ``The country and all its institutions cannot be insensitive to
the circumstances that nearly one-half of the population disagrees
radically'' with the amnesty, she told reporters.
   The decision was accepted quietly by the public. There was no
gloating by the victors or caravans of honking cars or fireworks
such as occurred in December, when the Electoral Court said the
referendum would be held.
   Sanguinetti last year predicted the amnesty law would survive
the referendum, saying overturning it carried the likelihood of a
``long, hazardous ... and dramatic period of confrontation''
between soldiers and civilians. The law was enacted as civil courts
were about call military officers to answer charges of murder,
kidnapping and torture. Officers indicated they would ignore
requests to testify, setting up a potential clash with the
   government.
   The same issue in Argentina has led to three unsuccessful
military insurrections there in the past 20 months against the
government of President Raul Alfonsin.
   
   Official figures indicated that more than 83 percent of the 2.3
million eligible voters cast ballots. Voting is mandatory and
failure to do so is punishable by a small fine.
   Supporters of the amnesty cast yellow ballots; opponents cast
green ones.
   The ``greens'' did best in Montevideo, which is home to almost
half the electorate, the traditional stronghold of the leftist
parties. In the countryside, ``yellows'' dominated by margins of
2-1 or more.
   Jaime Perez, secretary general of the Communist Party, said the
government intimidated citizens into voting for the amnesty.
   The government ``developed a campaign seeking to build up
elements of fear and uncertainty of what would happen if the
`greens' won,'' he told reporters. ``This campaign didn't take hold
in Montevideo, but it did in the countryside.''
   Sanguinetti, who was elected in November 1984 after democracy
was restored, said before the vote that the country should
concentrate on the future, including national elections set for
Nov. 26.
   Not all Uruguayans agreed.
   Standing in line waiting to vote in the upper middle class
neighborhood of Pocitos, a well-dressed woman said: ``A country
that forgets its past has no future. A future of peace and justice
depends on overturning'' the amnesty.
   She declined to give her name.

<HEAD>Dollar Slips; Stocks At New High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined against the Japanese yen for
the third consecutive day today, while share prices rose to yet
another record high on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 131.83 yen, down 0.62 from Friday's close.
It opened at 131.75 yen and ranged between 131.55 yen and 131.88
yen. The dollar has fallen 1.02 yen in the last three trading days.
   Currency dealers said the prospect of U.S. interest rates
topping out worked against the dollar.
   ``Major U.S. economic indicators released last week were within
the market's anticipated range, but now dollar-denominated interest
rates such as (U.S.) Treasury bonds will be in a downward direction
in the long-term perspective,'' said a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. Commerce Department said Friday the nation's trade
deficit in February widened to $10.50 billion, up from a revised
deficit of $8.68 billion for January. The U.S. Federal Reserve
Board said industrial production was unchanged in March from the
previous month. Both figures were largely in line with advance
estimates.
   Another dealer with a major Japanese bank said trading was
``relatively quiet'' ahead of the release of U.S. consumer price
figures in Washington Tuesday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, an 86.50-point gainer Friday, added 157.89 more
points, or 0.48 percent, closing at a record high 33,308.33 points.
   Dealers said some investors remained unenthusiastic because of
uncertainty over Japan's political situation, but heavy buying by
trust fund managers toward late afternoon lifted the Nikkei index.
   ``It is a difficult time for investors to make new orders,''
said a dealer with Nikko Securities Co. ``But the market's
fundamentals are not so bad.''

<HEAD>Government Boosting Imports of Consumer Goods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is boosting imports of shoes,
boots, soap, toothpaste and small tape-players this year to make up
for chronic shortages on store shelves, a newspaper report said.
   The weekly Arguments and Facts, in its April 15-21 edition,
quoted Deputy Trade Minister Suran Sarukhanov as saying officials
have added $8 billion to this year's $51.2 billion fund for imports
of consumer goods.
   The money will go for 15 million pairs of leather shoes, 12
million pairs of warm women's boots, 300 million razor blades, 10
million compact cassette players, as well as clothing, soap and
detergent, toothpaste and other goods, Sarukhanov was quoted as
saying.
   ``Our partners were amazed ... at our uncharacteristic
urgency,'' Sarukhanov was quoted as saying.
   Soviet officials have signed agreements with Yugoslavia, Turkey,
Malta, Japan, Cyprus, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and
Finland, he said.
   Officials decided to boost imports in December and Sarukhanov
said the goods started to appear on store shelves this month. The
boost in imports of consumer goods previously was not announced.
   There was no information on whether the increased spending was a
one-time decision or whether it would be continued in the future.
   Radical economists have urged the Kremlin to use some of its
hard currency to boost imports to fill in gaps in the market while
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev tries to reform the economy.
   Gorbachev has said that improving the living conditions of
Soviet citizens is the main goal of his reform effort. But after
four years, supplies of food and consumer goods are worse than
before the reforms started.
   Officials announced last week that sugar will be rationed in
Moscow beginning in May for the first time since World War II.

<TEXT>
   Roy Valentine Titus, a philanthropist and former
chairman of the cosmetics company founded by his mother, Helena
Rubinstein, has died of complications from diabetes. He was 79.
   Titus died Sunday at the Rusk Institute of New York University
Medical Center.
   Titus was born in London, the elder of Mrs. Rubinstein's two
sons by her first husband, Edward W. Titus.
   Titus moved with his family to the United States in 1914. After
earning degrees from Oxford and the Harvard School of Business
Administration, he joined a British affiliate of the cosmetics
company and served as an executive of the business in New York
until he retired in 1974.
   Titus served as chairman of the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, on
the board of the Children's Blood Foundation and the Board of
Governors of the Tel Aviv Museum, and was a trustee of the Oil,
Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers Union-Industry Pension Fund.
   A film buff, Titus in 1976 gave $1 million to the Museum of
Modern Art, which was used in part to renovate its film auditorium.
The auditorium was later divided and named the Roy and Niuta Titus
Theatres.
   He is survived by his wife, Niuta; a daughter from a previous
marriage, Helena R. Titus; a stepson, Louis Slesin; a stepdaughter,
Suzanne Slesin Steinberg, and two grandchildren.

<HEAD>Beijing, Shanghai Students Hold Marches To Honor Hu Yaobang</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of students in Beijing and Shanghai
marched today to mourn the death of former Communist Party chief Hu
Yaobang, an outspoken reformist toppled by conservatives two years
ago.
   ``Long live Hu Yaobang, long live democracy, long live freedom,
long live the rule of law!'' chanted more than 600 students from
Beijing's Political Science and Law College.
   Marching behind a huge red flag bearing their school's name, the
students laid wreaths in Hu's honor at the base of a monument to
Communist martyrs in Tiananmen Square, the symbolic seat of power
in China.
   Hu, who died Saturday at age 73 after suffering a heart attack,
was regarded by intellectuals as favoring greater artistic and
scholarly freedoms than other Chinese leaders.
   While a crowd of several thousand looked on, the students sang
the Internationale and chanted slogans for about half an hour
before dispersing.
   ``We just want to express our grief over Hu Yaobang's death
because he was a great leader and his death is a loss to the
nation,'' said one student. ``We aren't making any political
statement.''
   But another student, Wang Zhixun, said the students were
expressing ``an attitude'' of dissatisfaction with the failure of
China's leaders to institute democratic reforms.
   ``Hu Yaobang dared to speak out, and he said things we students
supported,'' Wang said.
   In Shanghai, more than 1,000 students marched late Sunday from
Fudan University to Tongji University, singing former odes to
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung but substituting Hu's name.
   The demonstration lasted more two hours and broke up early this
morning, said Jason Hurpado of Portland, Ore., who is teaching
English at Fudan.
   Students at three other schools in Beijing, including the
nation's leading school, Beijing University, put up hundreds of
posters on their campuses over the weekend to express sorrow over
Hu's death, demand that his ouster be reassessed and call for
greater democracy.
   Authorities in Beijing and Shanghai have made no efforts to
interfere with the student activities, the largest display of
student unrest since the student marches of 1986-87 that led to
Hu's ouster.
   In the late 1970s Hu supervised the party's rehabilitation of
thousands of people wrongly jailed during the far-left Cultural
Revolution, including many scholars.
   He was ousted as party chief in 1987 for allegedly encouraging
``bourgeois'' Western influences in China and failing to quash
nationwide student pro-democracy marches that year.

<TEXT>
   A group of dolphin-loving
environmentalists recline on the sand with eyes closed and
meditate, opening their minds to receive telepathic messages they
say the playful marine mammals send them.
   ``We're offering a true and profound experience with nature,''
said Bob Dennis, 28, who directs Project Delphinus Internaional
from his rented seaside home 50 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   As a group of the intelligent sea mammals surfaces near kelp
beds visible from his window, Dennis lifts an 8-inch conch shell
and blows, sending a deep bellow across the water.
   Dennis says the unorthodox group set up shop to document
communication between dolphins and humans in hopes the information
will further their environmental goals.
   He said if people truly believe they can communicate with
dolphins they will treat the animals with greater respect.
   ``Once you do that, how can you throw a beer can on the beach,
or shoot a dolphin because he's eating your squid?'' Dennis asked.
   The project was founded in 1987 by Dennis and Greg Hurley with
the goal of filming a documentary on dolphins to help end their
slaughter by fishermen.
   Group activities include meditation sessions on the beach,
wilderness excursions and dolphin-watching boat trips and
environmental talks. They also send a quarterly newsletter to about
3,000 people statewide.
   Project members believe the rituals of Australian aborigines,
Polynesian natives and other ancient cultures can help modern man
reunite with nature.
   To honor those rites and pay homage to dolphins during boating
trips, group members sound the conch shell horns and beat drums
lined with goat bellies to duplicate the way some ancient tribes
called the seagoing mammals that are renowned for the grace and
intelligence.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino today
brushed aside an offer by communist rebels to declare a cease-fire
if she pledges to close U.S. military bases, and the U.S.
ambassador called the proposal a bid to weaken her government.
   The rebel National Democratic Front offered Sunday to declare a
unilateral cease-fire in the 20-year insurgency and open peace
talks if Mrs. Aquino vows to close the six U.S. bases when their
lease expires in 1991.
   ``As I have said, if we want a cease-fire then let's have a
cease-fire first without any conditions,'' said Mrs. Aquino, who
has refused to say if she will support an extension of the lease.
   Mrs. Aquino also raised doubts about who really was authorized
to speak for the rebels: ``Until we can find out once and for all
who is the leader who can speak for all of them, it is really very
difficult to sit down with anybody.'' The rebel statement, which
was delivered to news organizations, was signed by Satur Ocampo,
one of two rebel negotiators in short-lived peace talks in 1986.
Ocampo made similar proposal in an interview last month.
   Jose Maria Sison, founder of the banned Communist Party of the
Philippines, also gave the same statement in a videotaped interview
from Utrecht, the Netherlands, where he has sought asylum. Sison's
interview was broadcast over local television two weeks ago.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said today that the rebel offer
was aimed at undermining U.S.-Philippine relations and weakening
the Aquino government.
   ``They realize that these bases and these facilities perform a
very important economic role, and they want to do anything they can
to weaken the government,'' Platt said in an interview with radio
station DZRH.
   ``And so they are working hard to try and arrange for this
relationship to end,'' he added. Platt said the United States would
close the bases if the Philippine government wants them out.
   The United States maintains Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval
Base, two of its largest facilities overseas, and four smaller
installations in the Philippines. More than 60,000 Filipinos are
employed at the bases, where about 40,000 U.S. troops and their
dependents are stationed.
   The rebel statement said that if the Aquino government were to
close the bases by 1991 and promise no further agreements for U.S.
bases, ``the National Democratic Front would not hesitate to
immediately declare a unilateral cease-fire and enter into
negotiations for a comprehensive political settlement and a
peaceful end to the civil war.''
   But if the government refuses, the rebels said they were
determined ``to make U.S. imperialism pay dearly for the continued
stay of its bases and its increasing intervention in our people's
affairs.''

<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 10-foot-high bullet barrier is being
built alongside a schoolyard to protect teachers and students from
frequent street gunfire.
   Construction of the 300-foot-long concrete wall at Lindbergh
Junior High School begins this week, its $160,000 cost financed by
the school district and Los Angeles County.
   ``It's really sad that something like this has to be done. But
it's needed in today's society,'' said Principal Max Fraley.
   One side of the school, where the recreation areas abut the
713-unit Carmelitos Housing Project, has been vulnerable to
gunfire. Physical education teachers say the wall is long overdue.
   When it is completed, teacher Trish Ryan said, she will
celebrate by hanging a sign reading: ``The Great Wall of
Lindbergh.''
   Judy Wade, another physical education teacher, said she has seen
beer bottles and even bicycle handlebars tossed at students during
her 25 years at the school. But, she added, ``now, it's not what
they're throwing but what they're shooting.''
   Last week, students were evacuated from the recreation fields
twice because of gunfire. Two years ago, in the only shooting in
which someone was hurt, a student playing basketball after school
was hit in the chest by a bullet and seriously hurt.
   ``We got angry. This is ridiculous. This is enough, we said.
We're taking our classes out there and we have to convince the kids
that it's OK, when we are not sure it's OK,'' Ryan said.
   ``Anything for the safety of the kids, but I think that $160,000
in law enforcement would do more to ease crime,'' said Carmelitos
resident Ray Fox, 28.
   Describing the North Long Beach projects, police Sgt. Bob
Gillissie said, ``We're there all the time'' because of drugs and
gang-related activities.
   Wesley C. Mitchell, chief of police for the Los Angeles Unified
School District, said the wall was ``a novel idea, but I don't know
if it is the solution to the problem.''

<TEXT>
   A cold front driving into the nation's midsection spread rain
and thunderstorms from Nebraska to the lower Great Lakes and
produced light snow further north.
   Temperatures dropped sharply in some northern states as cold
Canadian air moved down behind the front. Readings early today were
in the teens and 20s from western Montana to northern Minnesota.
   Light snow accompanied the cold in parts of Minnesota, South
Dakota, Wyoming and Montana.
   Further south, the front produced rain and thunderstorms in
western Nebraska, southern Minnesota and parts of the lower Great
Lakes.
   Thunderstorms were widely scattered over eastern and central
Oklahoma.
   Low pressure off the coast of northern New England continued to
produce light rain over Maine.
   Fog covered much of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers from the Great
Lakes and northern Ohio Valley across southern Minnesota, the
middle Mississippi Valley, Nebraska and northern Colorado; a few
thunderstorms from eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas to lower Michigan,
and in southern Florida; and rain mixed with wet snow from eastern
South Dakota into the central Rockies and in eastern Upper Michigan.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 30s from eastern North Dakota
across northern Minnesota into western Upper Michigan; 40s and 50s
in northern Maine, from lower Michigan across the northern Plains
to the northern Rockies; 80s from the middle and southern Atlantic
Coast across Florida, the Gulf Coast, the lower Mississippi Valley,
much of the southern Plains, the southern Rockies, northern Arizona
and Nevada to inland California; 90s across the Desert Southwest
and southwest Texas. Highs elsewhere were expected to be in the 60s
and 70s.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 18 degrees at Williston,
N.D., and Havre, Mont., to 82 degrees at Las Vegas.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls on Signs U.S. Economy Slowing, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against all major currencies in
early European trading today on growing signs that U.S. economic
growth is slowing, dealers said. Gold prices were also lower.
   ``The dollar is low and calm,'' said one Italian trader,
attributing the dollar's steep decline over the weekend to the
market's perception that U.S. interest rates have peaked.
   Last week's figures showing the growth rate in U.S. producer
prices slowed in March and the U.S. trade deficit widened in
February were interpreted as a signal for slower economic growth
and perhaps lower U.S. interest rates, dealers said.
   ``Major U.S. economic indicators released last week were within
the market's anticipated range, but now dollar-denominated interest
rates such as (U.S.) Treasury bonds will be in a downward direction
in the long-term perspective,'' said a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo
in the Japanese capital.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.62 yen to a closing 131.83. Later, in
London, it was quoted higher at 132.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday:
   _ 1.8595 West German marks, down from 1.8725
   _ 1.6405 Swiss francs, down from 1.6510
   _ 6.2910 French francs, down from 6.3350
   _ 2.09625 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1145
   _ 1,363.90 Italian lire, down from 1,374.25
   _ 1.1855 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1875
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7080, compared with
$1.7000 Friday.
   Bullion dealers said gold failed to get support from the weaker
dollar.
   ``Gold is in a bearish mood at the moment,'' one London dealer
commented. ``There is a lack of faith in the market after its
recent dismal performance.''
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $385.50 a troy ounce,
down from $386.50 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $385.15.
   In Zurich, gold was selling at a bid $385.20, down from $387.00
late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 71 cents to close at a bid
$386.74.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $5.81 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $5.87.

<HEAD>Solidarity Legal Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with Walesa to visit pope in
Rome. Picks up 9th pvs, `Two long ...' ^By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court today ruled Solidarity legal
again, officially ending a futile seven-year attempt by Communist
authorities to eradicate the Soviet bloc's first independent
workers' movement.
   A three-judge panel in a Warsaw provincial court handed down the
decision to register Solidarity in the same room where the union
movement led by Lech Walesa had its original charter approved in
November 1980.
   There was thunderous applause when the court completed the
about-face approved by Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who
had tried to dissolve Solidarity in a December 1981 martial-law
crackdown but now seeks the movement's help to pull Poland out of
economic crisis.
   Several Solidarity sources hinted that a meeting might take
place between Jaruzelski and Walesa on Tuesday.
   ``I am happy that we've just returned on the road of democracy
and freedom,'' Walesa said after hearing the decision at his home
in Gdansk, where he is recovering from a bad cold. He planned to
travel to Warsaw later in the day.
   With Solidarity registered, Walesa planned to fly Wednesday
morning to Rome to thank Polish-born Pope John Paul II for the
Roman Catholic church's role in helping to broker the agreement
with authorities.
   The last step in the long bid for restoration of the union
movement followed intensive negotiations between authorities and
the Solidarity-led opposition that ended April 5 with far-reaching
accords.
   The bargain grants Solidarity and other long-banned groups
legalization in exchange for opposition participation in
party-dominated parliament elections in June. It also creates the
first freely elected legislative chamber in the Soviet bloc _ a
Senate which will have veto power over the current unicameral
parliament, or Sejm, where authorities will maintain a majority.
   As the court session ended, hundreds of hands lifted in the
``V'' for victory sign and chants of ``Solidarnosc, Solidarnosc''
filled the room. The Solidarity leaders beamed and the judges shook
hands with the participants.
   Two long Solidarity banners were held up through the hearing
before Presiding Judge Danuta Widawska, about a dozen key
Solidarity activists and 300 spectators. Outside the courtroom
another 100 supporters waited.
   ``Today means for me the restoration of justice,'' said Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, the senior Solidarity adviser who led the delegation
that submitted the application.
   Mazowiecki, who was on hand for Solidarity's first legalization
in 1980, added, ``I hope I will not have to come here a third
time.''
   The Rev. Henryk Jankowski, Walesa's close adviser, said he came
from his Gdansk church to ``verify'' Walesa's words at the funeral
of pro-Solidarity priest Jerzy Popieluszko, slain by the secret
police: ``You gave your life so Solidarity could live.''
   Solidarity had a stormy 16-month legal existence before it was
suspended by Jaruzelski's martial-law decree of Dec. 13, 1981,
which led to the interning thousands of activists and the 11-month
detention of Walesa.
   The union that once claimed the membership of one in three Poles
officially was banned in October 1982 but never ceased to function
_ first as an underground organization and then more openly after a
1986 political amnesty took effect.
   The Communist party says its decision to legalize Solidarity
again results from changes in the political situation over the
years that open the possibility for a more responsible union
devoted to trade union issues and not politics.
   Party and government officials also admit they hope that
legalizing the union will encourage the West to reschedule Poland's
massive foreign debt and ease the pressure on the struggling
economy.
   President Bush scheduled a speech today in the heavily
Polish-American community of Hamtramck, Mich., to unveil new
economic package for Poland.

   Sergei Petrov, an artist and photographer denied
permission to emigrate for eight years, said today he is being
allowed to leave the Soviet Union.
   ``I have my passport in my hand,'' Petrov, 36, said by telephone.
   He said he will go to the United States ``as soon as I can,
sometime this week,'' but that his plans were not certain.
   Petrov said he received notification from the Soviet visa office
in Sunday's mail and picked up his external passport this morning.
   Petrov's photographs were displayed last year at the U.S. State
Department, and his case has been one of the human rights cases
pursued by the United States.
   Asked why he now was being granted permission to leave, Petrov
said: ``I will never know. I think the reason is all the joint
effort of the U.S. Embassy, the State Department, and other
countries like the Netherlands and Australia. But mostly it was the
State Department's pressure.''
   Former U.S. Ambassador Arthur Hartman and his wife Donna worked
especially hard on his case, Petrov said.
   Petrov tried since 1981 to join his American wife, Virginia
Johnson, but was turned down for reasons of state security. He says
he was told before he began working in an electronics laboratory in
1977 that he would not be permitted to leave the country for five
years.
   He left the laboratory after three months.

   Americans overwhelmingly believe that outlawing
abortion would do little to curtail it, and half want the operation
to remain legal and unrestricted in early pregnancies, a poll has
found.
   The Media General-Associated Press poll of 1,108 adults also
found broad opposition to Operation Rescue, whose members have been
blocking entrances to abortion clinics around the country.
   With the U.S. Supreme Court poised to reconsider its 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion during the first three
months of pregnancy, 53 percent in the random-sample survey said
they favored that landmark ruling.
   Moreover, if the court were to reverse itself and let each state
make its own abortion laws, 57 percent said they would want
abortion legal in their state. Thirty-seven percent would want it
illegal and 7 percent were unsure.
   The poll posed the issue in a variety of ways because the
wording of questions on a sensitive issue can affect the results.
   The findings on basic attitudes toward abortion were similar in
other recent polls. But in a new finding, large majorities said
outlawing abortion would fail to prevent it.
   Abortion proponents argue that many women would have unsafe
illegal abortions if the procedure were banned.
   The poll asked: ``If abortion were illegal in your state, do you
think that would stop most women there who want abortions from
having them, or would most of them go to another state where it was
legal?'' Eighty-seven percent said the women would go to another
state.
   The poll then asked whether banning abortions nationwide would
stop most women from having them, or if those women would have
illegal abortions or go to a country where abortion is legal.
Seventy-three percent said women would find a way to have abortions.
   The survey found its closest split on the question of a
constitutional amendment to make abortions illegal except in cases
of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. Fifty percent
were opposed and 44 percent in favor, a division within the poll's
3-point error margin.
   No such amendment is before Congress, but those are the terms
President Bush has said he would support.
   In another question on conditions under which abortion may be
permitted, the poll asked: ``Should abortion be legal as it is now;
legal only in such cases as rape, incest, or to save the life of
the mother; or should it not be permitted at all?'' Fifty percent
said legal as now; 39 percent said only in certain cases; 7 percent
wanted it banned outright and the rest were unsure.
   That question has been asked since 1985 by the CBS News-New York
Times poll, which has found a slight increase in support for
current law. Depending on the questions, however, other polls have
found slight declines in support for abortion, and others still
have found no movement.
   In a question outside the legal context, the Media General-AP
poll asked: ``If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor
agrees to it, should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not?''
Sixty-five percent said yes, 25 percent said no and the remaining
10 percent had no opinion. The CBS-Times poll has found a similar
and steady response to that question since 1980.
   Opposition to abortion was greatest among older, less wealthy
and less educated respondents, and Republicans and conservatives.
There was no significant division in opinions between men and women.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control say 1.3 million
abortions are performed annually in the United States, making it
one of the nation's most common surgical procedures. The Supreme
Court next week is to hear a case that could enable it to review
its 1973 ruling legalizing abortion.
   The Media General-AP survey also found:
   _Sixty-seven percent were opposed to demonstrations by Operation
Rescue.
   _Narrow opposition to use of federal funds to help poor women
with their medical bills if they want an abortion. Forty-nine
percent were opposed to such spending, 41 percent in favor. The
rest did not answer.
   _Support for legalization in the United States of a new pill, RU
486, which halts a pregnancy by cutting off a hormone necessary to
keep an egg implanted in the uterus.
   Anti-abortion activists call the drug an abortion pill, and have
threatened boycotts against its producers. Supporters of the pill,
which is available in France, call it simpler and safer than
surgical abortion. In the poll, 51 percent said it should be legal
here; 24 percent said it should not; 25 percent were unsure.
   The poll was conducted March 6-15 by the AP and Media General
Inc., a communications company based in Richmond, Va., that
publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader,
the Tampa (Fla.) Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and
operates TV stations WXFL in Tampa, WCBD in Charleston, S.C., and
WJKS in Jacksonville, Fla.

   A bomb exploded outside a U.S.
Embassy warehouse, killing a man who apparently was trying to plant
it and injuring his companion, police said.
   Embassy spokesman Charles V. Barclay said the warehouse in
eastern Tegucigalpa, about a mile from the embassy, suffered no
damage but the explosion interupted power in the area for about 20
minutes.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's
blast. There have been three attacks on U.S. personnel and
installations in the country so far this year.
   Officials said Miguel Aguilar Flores, 39, a Honduran driver for
a state company was killed in the blast. A second, unidentified man
was injured and taken to a local hospital for treatment.
   National Police sources told The Associated Press the two
apparently were planting the bomb when it exploded. They said the
two had been riding a motorcycle.
   Police said they discovered detonators, grenades and similar
explosive devices among the men's belongings.
   It was not immediately known what is stored in the warehouse. In
the past, it has been used to store embassy vehicles, furniture and
office supplies.
   The most recent attack against U.S. personnel or installation in
Honduras occurred last week when U.S. troops exchanged fire with
attackers in northern Honduras. No one was injured in that
incident, but one jeep was destroyed by a bomb.

   Thieves have returned one of three
Vincent van Gogh paintings they stole from a museum in hopes of
obtaining a $2.5 million ransom, police said today.
   No ransom was paid for ``The Loom,'' which was taken from the
Kroeller-Mueller National Museum in December and recovered unharmed
April 6 from the trunk of a car parked near the home of the
museum's director, police spokesman Theo Reus said.
   The return of the painting and dealings with the thieves had
been kept secret but police decided to publicize the events today
because a newspaper learned of the negotiations, Reus said.
   The thieves returned ``The Loom'' to prove they were possessed
the other two stolen art works, ``Wilted Sunflowers'' and an early
version of ``The Potato Eaters.''
   He said no ransom has been paid and the whereabouts of the
remaining two paintings is unknown. The total value of the three
works has been estimated at $100 million to $125 million.
   On Dec. 12 the thieves smashed a museum window and stole the
paintings.
   The three works were not insured by the state because of the
high premiums that would be required. Police and art experts have
said it would be nearly impossible to sell the paintings because
they are so well known.

<HEAD>Couple Charged with Prostitution Say Sex Is Their Religion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple offering sex to followers of their
Church of the Most High Goddess say their arrests on
prostitution-related charges violate their religious freedom.
   Will and Mary Ellen Tracy were arrested last week, Mrs. Tracy
for investigation of prostitution and her husband for investigation
of pimping. Both are free on $2,000 bail.
   Mrs. Tracy, 46, said she and other ``priestesses'' absolve the
sins of male followers with sex acts in what she claims is a
revival of ancient Egyptian religious rites. Her husband said
followers must contribute money or services to take part in the
rituals.
   ``Anything God wants from me, I will give him,'' Mrs. Tracy
said. ``If he wants me to be monogamous, I'll be monogamous. If he
says go have sex with 20,000 men, I'll do it.''
   Tracy, 51, said he will ask that the charges be dismissed on
grounds of freedom of religion.
   ``If you accept money for a sex act, it's prostitution,'' said
Detective Alan Vanderpool.
   The couple live in Santa Clarita, 30 miles from downtown Los
Angeles, but operate their church out of a four-bedroom,
Spanish-style rented house near Beverly Hills.
   The sparsely furnished house has no pews or pulpit. The few wall
hangings include posters of movie stars and a nude photograph of
Mrs. Tracy. The priestesses wear strapless red-sequined dresses,
fish-net hose and black spiked heels.

<TEXT>
   Authorities were investigating the cause of a
suspicious fire that swept through a historic, century-old loft
building, destroying millions of dollars worth of art and at least
eight galleries.
   All that remained today of the six-story, block-square warehouse
designed by the noted Chicago architect Louis Sullivan was a brick
shell.
   Witnesses said Saturday's fire began in at least two spots,
``and very seldom do two fires break out simultaneously,'' said
Fire Department spokesman Tom Sheppard.
   Gallery owners said the River North art district should recover
quickly from the fire.
   ``The major galleries will be back in business,'' said dealer
William van Straaten, who lost $3 million in prints in the blaze,
including works by Americans Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg.
   The fire struck as dealers were preparing for the annual Art
Expo spring exposition next month at Chicago's Navy Pier, which
attracts art dealers from around the world and is considered the
most important annual show for Chicago's art community.
   Van Straaten estimated that the combined loss to all the
galleries in the building could total as much as $50 million.
   ``I am totally wiped out,'' said Jonathan Santlofer, a New York
artist who spent two years on the 13 paintings and drawings he had
hanging in one of the galleries when the fire struck.
   ``I may try to do something like it again, but I won't be able
to do it exactly the same,'' said Santlofer, whose abstract
paintings used religious motifs.
   The building was constructed in 1885 and had been recommended
for landmark status by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. In
recent years, it was the linchpin of the burgeoning River North
area, which is filled with restaurants, nightclubs and dozens of
galleries.

   The 100th anniversary of the birth of
Thomas Hart Benton, whose work brought him fame but not acceptance
by the art world's elite, received a spirited celebration in his
home state.
   Benton's admirers cut cake and drank toasts Sunday on the lawn
of the Nelson Gallery, where a major retrospective opened.
   ``Benton is still speaking to a large crowd,'' curator Henry
Adams said as 4,000 to 5,000 people toured the exhibit of almost 90
paintings.
   ``This is a very bold show, in that it maintains that Benton was
a major force in American art that has been overlooked,'' Adams
said.
   The exhibit moves to Detroit, New York City and Los Angeles
after its run at the Nelson ends June 18.
   On Saturday, the actual birthdate, a show of 55 Benton
lithographs opened at four financial institutions in Neosho, a town
of about 9,000 people where the artist grew up. He was regarded
there as egotistical and left with no love lost at age 17.
   At Kelly's, a bar in Westport, Benton's passion for bourbon was
celebrated Sunday with the sixth annual Benton Birthday Bourbon &amp;
Brunch Bash, aimed at raising $10,000 for scholarships to the
Kansas City Art Institute.

<TEXT>
   Former hostage John-Paul Kauffmann today accused
Britain of weakness for refusing to negotiate the release of
journalist John McCarthy and other British citizens held captive in
Lebanon.
   ``Put yourself in his place,'' Kauffmann told a meeting to mark
the third anniversary of the kidnapping of McCarthy, 32, a
television reporter abducted on his way to Beirut airport.
   ``His country, Great Britain, has abandoned him. British
officials say they won't negotiate because it will only lead to the
taking of other hostages. I say you can negotiate without giving
in.''
   The French and West German governments managed to secure the
release of their hostages without being brought to their knees,
Kauffmann said at the meeting organized by British and French
journalists.
   Kauffmann, a magazine writer and French citizen, was freed in
May 1988 after more than three years' captivity.
   France, which was under constant pressure to get back its
hostages, has denied paying ransom. It complied with several
Iranian demands, including banishing the main Iranian opposition
group from Paris.
   Kauffmann said he recently helped mark the start of the fifth
anniversary in captivity of Terry Anderson, 42, the chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press and the longest held of
15 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   ``There's something cruel in these anniversaries,'' he said.
   Today's meeting at UNESCO headquarters was organized by British
and French journalists. Those at the meeting issued an appeal to
all with influence ``to do whatever they can immediately to help
secure their release.''
   Organizer Anthony Brock, a British writer, said the appeal would
be sent to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and the
Iranian and Syrian embassies in Paris.
   Iran influences Moslem extremists holding the hostages, while
Syria is the main foreign power broker in Lebanon.
   A group working for McCarthy's release ran cinema, television
and newspaper advertisements today.
   One asked movie goers in Britain to close their eyes and think
of England because McCarthy has ``done nothing else for the last
three years.''
   In a message with Arabic voice-over on Lebanese television, the
hostage's mother, Sheila, said:
   ``Three years of fear, grief and loneliness is a long time.
Three years is a long time in a young man's life.''
   His father, Pat, told his son, ``Whatever you do, old chap, keep
your spirits up.''
   They published similar messages in the Beirut daily As-Safir.
Another message in the newspaper, signed ``Jill'' and apparently
from McCarthy's girlfriend, Jill Morell, said: ``I wish more than
anything that you could be back home with us. But until then, I'm
sending you all my special love.''

   Two men found buried one atop the other
on a communal farm were killed by the same cult of drug smugglers
that sacrificed 13 people and buried the mutilated corpses at a
ranch nearby, authorities said.
   The two bodies found Sunday were in an orchard two miles from
Rancho Santa Elena, where the other corpses were dug up last week.
   The 72-year-old father of one of the two victims led police to
the bodies. He said some children had told him last fall they had
seen people burying a body, but he discounted the story until the
13 corpses were dug up, authorities said.
   Police believe Rancho Santa Elena, about 20 miles west of
Matamoros, was where a cult performed sacrifices and other rites to
protect their drug smuggling from police and rivals. The bodies
found last week had been dismembered, and their hearts, brains and
other organs removed for use in rituals, police said.
   The bodies found at the communal farm Sunday had not been
dismembered, said Martin Elias Salazar, a federal judicial police
group chief who supervised Sunday's exhumations. A sheriff's deputy
in Brownsville, a Texas city across the Rio Grande from Matamoros,
said the deaths apparently were drug related.
   Salazar said police had long suspected the two men of selling
drugs. That suspicion, plus the proximity of the grave to the
ranch, led Salazar to believe they had done business with the cult
before it turned to committing human sacrifices.
   Four men being held in Matamoros in the 13 other slayings had
not been questioned about the newly found bodies, Salazar said. He
added they were to be interrogated after a court appearance today.
   Salazar said police then would determine whether to search for
more bodies.
   Serafin Hernandez Garcia, Elio Hernandez Rivera, Sergio Martinez
and David Serna Valdez were to be formally charged today with
murder, kidnapping and drug and weapons possession, authorities
said.
   The cult's leaders, Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, and Sara
Maria Aldrete, 24, were still being sought, police said. Constanzo
allegedly ran a marijuana-smuggling ring that sneaked a ton of the
drug into the United States weekly, officials have said.
   Federal police in Mexico City said they were investigating
possible links between the killings and recent slayings in Mexico
City, but had found nothing yet.
   On Sunday, officers inspected a garden across the street from
Constanzo's luxurious house in Atizapan, 13 miles north of Mexico
City, for signs that bodies might have been buried, but found
nothing.
   ``They wouldn't be stupid enough to bury them here anyway,''
said one officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Friday, federal police searched Constanzo's Atizapan house
and the apartments of two associates who are fugitives. They found
a couple of marble altars, but no signs of human sacrifice.
   Neighbors said three to five young men suddenly fled the house
in late-model luxury cars early Tuesday, the day the first 12
bodies were found. One of the four suspects captured that day led
police to a 13th body Thursday.
   Like most of the victims found at Rancho Santa Elena, the two
men found Sunday had been struck in the back of the head with a
machete, said Jose Delgadillo, an employee at the Matamoros funeral
home where the bodies were taken.
   Delgadillo had watched while a doctor examined the remains
Sunday night.
   ``The bones were whole. They were not dismembered,'' Delgadillo
said. ``One can't tell if the hearts and other organs were removed,
because the bodies were decomposed. It's pretty revolting.''
   Delgadillo dug up the bodies as police stood around, took
pictures and cracked jokes. The bottom body was clad in black pants
and snakeskin boots. A pants pocket contained a U.S. $5 bill and
3,000 Mexican pesos. Little was left of the remains but bones.

<TEXT>
   Toni Matt is a former Austrian ski
champion and U.S. national downhill champion, but he says he is
remembered most for one legendary mad dash down Tuckerman Ravine 50
years ago.
   ``I got more mileage out of that race than all the rest of them
put together,'' he said Sunday on a nostalgic return to the
mountain on the 50th anniversary of his famous schuss in the
Inferno Race.
   Matt said he ``never skied anything like it and I don't think
anyone else has either ... because it drops off so fast.''
   Tuckerman Ravine, on 6,288-foot Mount Washington, is only a
small portion of the four-mile race. Its most notable feature is
the headwall, with a 1,000-foot drop at angles that reach 65
degrees. Matt made a straight run down the ravine.
   Lowell Thomas, the late broadcaster who witnessed the event
along with 2,000 spectators, described it this way:
   ``The first racers took a good three or four swinging,
high-speed turns on the headwall to check their speed. But when
Matt came bolting over the edge, because it was so steep, he knew a
turn wouldn't slow him down _ he schussed the wall like a lead
plummet hitting 85 miles per hour as he came streaming off the
bottom, his skis shattering the icy snow.''
   Matt reeled through the bottom of the trail, just missing a tree
before finishing the run in 6 minutes, 29.4 seconds. That was a
full minute faster than runner-up Dick Durrance and smashed the
previous record of more than 13 minutes.
   World Cup downhill races last about two minutes, and racers
average about 75 mph.
   ``I don't remember anything about it,'' said the 69-year-old
Matt, who lives in Pawling, N.Y. ``It goes so fast. It only takes a
few seconds from time you see the headwall and you're halfway down,
and before you know it, it's all over.
   ``I wasn't frightened. I was used to speed, although not that
fast, and I was in good shape,'' he said.
   The race was discontinued after Matt's 1939 feat because of
unpredictable weather.

<HEAD>Third Major Auto Maker Shuts In South Korea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third auto maker halted production
today in response to a wave of strikes by workers seeking higher
wages. Officials said the job actions threaten the nation's economy.
   Daewoo Motor Co., a joint venture between the U.S.-based General
Motors Corp. and South Korea's Daewoo Group, stopped its assembly
line today after a walkout at its parts suppliers. Similar protests
forced two other car makers _ Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motor Corp.
_ to stop production last week.
   Government officials said the actions by the three manufacturers
will slash South Korea's auto exports, projected at 650,000 cars
this year.
   Also today, 5,000 taxi drivers rallied in a park to press
demands for higher wages and improved working conditions. The
drivers threatened to strike next week unless their demands are met.
   South Korea has been hit by 431 worker strikes for higher wages
and benefits so far this year and 133 are still in progress, the
Labor Ministry said today. Government officials said strikes were
spreading to nearly all manufacturing industries and small firms.
   Police raided offices of labor activists and dissidents today
and seized thousands of leaflets in a crackdown on strikes. About
50 labor activists have been arrested.
   Kim Kun, head of the state-run Bank of Korea, said South Korea
is unlikely to achieve its economic growth target of 8 percent this
year, partly because of the strikes.
   Average wages in South Korea increased by 20 percent in 1987 and
1988, harming the international competitiveness of Korean products,
he said.
   South Korea registered a trade surplus of $94 million for the
January-March period, far below $1.35 billion in the same period
last year. In March alone, imports exceeded exports by $1 million,
South Korea's first monthly trade deficit in 19 months.
   In the worst labor unrest this year, thousands of riot police
stormed Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., South Korea's largest
shipyard, on March 31 to end a 109-day strike. The police action in
the southeastern industrial city of Ulsan triggered violent
protests by angry workers that lasted about two weeks and left
hundreds of workers and policemen injured.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Roy Mabus called the Legislature back
to work today to take up a measure that would protect Parole Board
members from being sued for crimes committed by freed inmates.
   Lawmakers during the three-day special session will also
consider a $79 million building program.
   The two proposals died in the closing days of the 1989 regular
session, which ended two weeks ago.
   The new Parole Board would have five full-time members with
immunity from liability. The current board has four part-time
members and a full-time chairman who meet several days a month.
   Momentum for restructuring the board built after a state judge
last year ordered three members to pay $3 million to a banker shot
and paralyzed by a parolee. The judgment is being appealed.
   The restructuring measure died on the last day of the regular
session after Mabus threatened a veto if it included an amendment
barring appointment of anyone who contributed $500 or more to any
campaign of the appointing governor.
   A proposal to issue bonds for capital improvements and property
purchases failed partly because some legislators were reluctant to
add to the state's indebtedness.

   The head of Romania's national

officials said today.
   Ella Zeller-Constantinescu, a former world champion who also is
vice president of the European Table Tennis Union, defected after
the table tennis World Championship in Dortmund.
   After the event ended April 9, she refused to return to Romania

   Another Romanian sportswoman today was reported missing in
Rennes, France, where she participated in a swim meet. Police said
they had not excluded the possibility she intended to seek
political asylum.
   Livia Capariu, 16, who recently clocked world-class performances

missing just before her team left for Bucharest, police told the
French news agency Agence France-Presse.
   Team officials told police they searched without turning up any

<HEAD>Court to Decide if States May Tax TV Evangelists Sales of Merchandise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states may tax television evangelists' sales of religious
books, tapes and other merchandise.
   The justices said they will review rulings that forced the
Louisiana-based Jimmy Swaggart Ministries to pay California
$183,000 in back taxes and interest for the years 1974 through 1981.
   Lawyers for Swaggart's organization argue that the California
tax, as applied, violates religious freedom.
   A state appeals court rejected that argument, and the California
Supreme Court turned down an appeal by Swaggart's lawyers last Nov.
17.
   The disputed state sales and use tax is imposed on ``retailers''
for the privilege of selling personal property in California, and
on the consumption of products.
   The tax was imposed on sales by the Swaggart ministry during
crusades in California and sales made through the mails.
   For the years at issue, mail-order sales from Baton Rouge, La.,
to California consumers totaled $1.7 million. Sales of merchandise
at California crusades totaled $240,000.
   The appeal acted on today argued, ``What could be a clearer
violation of the free exercise of the religion of the religious
adherent than to tax that adherent for exercising the right to use
the religious material distributed by the evangelist.''
   The appeal relied heavily on a 1943 ruling in which the nation's
highest court overturned the convictions of Jehovah's Witnesses who
violated a city ordinance requiring all people engaged in
door-to-door canvassing to get a license and pay a fee.
   The Jehovah's Witnesses were distributing religious literature.
   The court said in its 1943 ruling, ``This form of religious
activity occupies the same high estate under the First Amendment as
do worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits.''
   The California appeals court acknowledged the 1943 ruling and
said, ``Evangelism, whether by age-old methods or by new
technologies, is protected by ... the First Amendment.''
   But the appeals court said the 1943 decision and other past
Supreme Court rulings have banned flat licensing taxes on religious
endeavors.
   ``The Supreme Court did not equate a financial burden in and of
itself with an unconstitutional burden on the exercise of
religion,'' the state court said.
   The appeals court noted that in a 1983 decision striking down a
Minnesota tax as discriminatory against certain newspapers, the
Supreme Court said, ``Our cases have consistently recognized that
nondiscriminatory taxes on the receipts or income of newspapers
would be permissible.''
   The state court concluded: ``A religious organization which
seeks to disseminate its religious message through sales ... should
not enjoy rights to communicate and distribute their message
superior to those of other organizations having social, political
or other ideological messages to proselytize such as newspapers.''
   The case is Jimmy Swaggart Ministries vs. Board of Equalization,
88-1374.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Accepts California Tax Case on Multinationals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to settle some
key questions involving the ability of multinational corporations
to challenge state taxes in federal court.
   What the justices decide sometime next year in a California case
could carry big-money significance for most states and many big
businesses.
   The court, granting an appeal by California officials, said they
will review a ruling that allowed two multinational corporations to
challenge a state tax in federal court.
   In a 1984 ruling seen as a major victory for states, the
justices ruled that California may tax multinational corporations
based on the businesses' worldwide income.
   But that decision applied only to multinationals whose parent
company is located in the United States.
   The case acted on today involves multinationals whose parent
company is based in a foreign country.
   California's business tax _ the same levy upheld in the 1984
ruling _ was challenged by Alcan Aluminium Limited, a Canadian
corporation, and Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, a British
corporation.
   California taxed subsidiaries of the multinationals doing
business in the state.
   The California tax employs what is known as the unitary system.
The method bases the tax on a share of worldwide earnings, payroll
and property value of each multinational and its subsidiaries.
   At issue in the appeal acted on today is whether multinationals
based abroad have legal standing to challenge such unitary state
taxes in federal courts in the United States.
   Alcan and Imperial challenged the California tax in a federal
court in Chicago, where the California Franchise Tax Board has an
office.
   A federal judge threw out the suits on grounds that the parent
companies claimed they were injured only in their capacity as
shareholders of their subsidiaries _ and therefore lacked legal
standing.
   Generally, shareholders are barred from suing in such cases
unless they can demonstrate ``a direct and independent injury''
from the corporation.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October overturned
the judge's decision againt Alcan and Imperial, reinstating their
suits. The appeals court said there is grounds for the parent
companies to assert a direct and independent injury.
   ``Shareholders with direct, personal interests in a cause of
action can bring suit even if the corporation's legal rights and
obligations are also implicated,'' the appeals court said.
   The asserted injuries to Alcan and Imperial are direct and
independent, the appeals court said, because ``the unitary tax
diminishes the attractiveness of owning American subsidiaries in
comparison with entering into contracts with independent companies
as a means of engaging in foreign commerce.''
   The appeals court added: ``The potential for the unitary tax to
penalize foreign ownership of American assets distinguishes'' it
from other forms of state regulation _ environmental or safety
rules, for example _ that ``would presumably affect foreign and
domestically owned operations fairly equally.''
   The appeals court said taxes like the one imposed by California
``have fueled a simmering trade controversy which has raised
concerns about foreign retaliation and the (United States') ability
to speak with one voice on matters of foreign commerce.''
   Most states and the Multistate Tax Commission joined in
supporting California's appeal.
   The commission said the 7th Circuit court ruling's effect is to
permit multinational corporations to ``forum shop'' around the
country for a sympathetic federal judge who will permit the
businesses to challenge the state taxes.
   The case is Franchise Tax Board vs. Alcan Aluminium, 88-1400.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in an important banking
industry case, today asked the Bush administration for its view on
whether U.S. banks with branch offices overseas must pay depositors
after foreign governments seize or freeze those accounts.
   The court invited Justice Department lawyers to comment on
rulings that required Citibank to pay depositors.
   The justices are not expected to say whether they will grant
full review to the case until hearing from the government lawyers,
which could take months.
   Robert H. Bork, a former federal judge whose Supreme Court
nomination was defeated by the Senate in 1987, is representing
Citibank.
   If the court were to grant review, Bork might become the first
defeated nominee in the court's history to later argue a case
before the justices.
   In the appeal acted on today, Bork said billions of dollars are
at stake. There are more than 900 branches of U.S. banks operating
in 73 countries, with some $225 billion in deposits.
   The cases acted on today stem from the fall of Saigon, Vietnam,
to the Vietcong in 1975 and economic troubles in the Philippines in
1983.
   The Vietnamese case involves an account at Citibank's Saigon
office opened in 1974 by Quang Quy Trinh, a retired South
Vietnamese government official.
   The account, which paid annual interest of 19 percent compounded
daily, was for Trinh's son, Ngoc Quang Trinh, a student in Michigan
at the time.
   The deposit agreement between Trinh and Citibank said the bank
did not accept responsibility for any loss due to ``government
orders, laws ... or from any other cause beyond its control.''
   Citibank closed its Saigon branch on April 24, 1975, on the eve
of the city's fall to communist troops.
   The elder Trinh was placed in a re-education camp by the new
regime, and after he was released in 1980 sent the Citibank
passbook to his son in Michigan.
   The younger Trinh sued the bank to recover the deposits.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last July upheld a ruling
that Citibank must pay Trinh $3,196.36, including $1,792.69 in
interest.
   The appeals court rejected Citibank's argument that its deposit
agreement excused it from paying deposits lost because of political
revolution.
   The agreement the elder Trinh signed did not mean he was ``aware
that he had given up his right to proceed against the home office
(of Citibank) in the event the branch was no longer in existence
and could not pay its depositors,'' the appeals court said.
   It added that both Trinh and Citibank are innocent parties in
the case, but one must suffer a loss.
   In the Philippines case, Wells Fargo Asia Limited in Singapore
deposited $2 million with the Citibank branch in Manila in June
1983. The money was to be repaid with interest six months later.
   But on Oct. 15, 1983, the Philippine government of Ferdinand
Marcos _ who was deposed and fled to Hawaii in 1986 _ froze the
accounts of foreign banks. The move prevented Citibank from
repaying the Manila deposits to Wells Fargo.
   Wells Fargo sued to recover the money, and Citibank later paid
it $934,000. Citibank withheld the balance of the original deposit.
   A federal judge in 1987 ordered Citibank to repay the balance in
1987, and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling
last July.
   The appeals court relied on an agreement between the two banks
that suggested Citibank's home office in New York City had the duty
to pay the money.
   The cases are Citibank vs. Trinh, 88-1031, and Citibank vs.
Wells Fargo, 88-1260.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating the murder conviction of a New York City man who
confessed to killing his former girlfriend after police illegally
arrested him at his home.
   The court said it will review a ruling that threw out Bernard
Harris' conviction because his confession was used as evidence
against him.
   The ruling is being appealed by Bronx prosecutors.
   The New York State Court of Appeals last October ruled that
Harris is entitled to a new trial on charges stemming from the
stabbing death of Thelma Staton.
   Ms. Staton's body was found in her apartment Jan. 11, 1984.
Police were told by Ms. Staton's daughter that Harris had kidnapped
the victim several days earlier and had raped her before letting
her go.
   Police said they went to Harris' apartment five days after
discovering Ms. Staton's body, with probable cause to believe
Harris was the killer. But they did not have an arrest warrant.
   After knocking on Harris' door and receiving no answer, one
officer went down a fire escape to a window and announced that the
police had arrived. Other officers at the front door, with guns
drawn and badges displayed, then were allowed by Harris to enter.
   Harris was given his so-called Miranda warnings that he had a
right to remain silent and have a lawyer's help. Police said Harris
then poured himself a glass of wine and confessed to killing Ms.
Staton.
   He was arrested and taken to the stationhouse where, about one
hour later, he gave police a written confession.
   A trial judge ruled that Harris' confession at the apartment
could not be used as evidence because his arrest _ made without a
warrant and in violation of his privacy rights _ was unlawful.
   But the judge permitted prosecutors to introduce as evidence the
stationhouse confession, ruling it was not tainted by the illegal
arrest. The connection between the arrest and the stationhouse
confession was sufficiently ``attenuated'' to permit its use, the
judge ruled.
   But the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court,
ruled that the stationhouse confession was a direct byproduct of
the unlawful arrest.
   The state court relied heavily on a 1980 Supreme Court ruling
that said police must have a warrant to arrest someone at home
unless some emergency exists.
   The justices in that case barred from being used as evidence a
bullet casing found at a murder suspect's home.
   The New York court said the 1980 ruling means ``the fruits of
illegal entries must be suppressed even though the police might
have probable cause to conduct a search or effectuate an arrest
outside the home without a warrant.''
   The case is New York vs. Harris, 88-1000.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to study a
``strike'' by lawyers in the nation's capital who sought higher pay
to represent penniless criminal defendants.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by federal officials who
say the lawyers violated antitrust law.
   The Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association here organized a
boycott in 1983 to pressure the District of Columbia government to
increase hourly compensation the city pays attorneys who represent
indigent criminal defendants.
   Some 100 lawyers who represent most of the city's poor criminal
defendants had been receiving $30 an hour for time in court and $20
an hour for out-of-court work. They won a $25 per hour increase
after a two-week boycott in which nearly all them refused to accept
new cases.
   The boycott created a crisis for the city, swamping the the city
public defender's office with criminal cases. The city government
agreed to the higher hourly rate at an annual cost to taxpayers of
more than $4 million.
   The private lawyers who boycotted represent 85 percent of the
poor defendants. The remaining defendants are represented by the
public defender service, third-year law students or, in a small
number of cases, lawyers volunteering to work without pay.
   After the so-called strike, the Federal Trade Commission ruled
that the lawyers engaged in price-fixing and an illegal boycott.
The FTC ordered the lawyers not to engage in similar conduct in the
future.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here set aside the FTC
decision and ordered the agency to restudy the case to determine
whether the lawyers had exerted ``market power'' in their boycott.
   Alleged antitrust violators are considered to be exerting market
power if they are capable of exercising economic control over a
relevant market.
   The appeals court here said it was unclear whether the boycott
succeeded because the lawyers exercised market power or political
clout.
   ``Power of some sort was surely exercised,'' the appeals court
said. ``The city council approved a rate increase it had long
refused two weeks into a boycott that disrupted the court system
and generated significant publicity.''
   The appeals court said the lawyers may have succeeded, even
though they lacked market power, by changing public attitudes and
making it politically safe for the city council to raise their pay.
   The boycott may have succeeded because it was persuasive rather
than coercive, the appeals court added.
   Also, the appeals court said, the FTC must judge the lawyers
``with a special solicitude'' because free-expression rights
protected by the Constitution are involved.
   The lawyers said the boycott was an exercise of their First
Amendment rights to petition the government for a redress of
grievances.
   In appealing to the Supreme Court, the FTC said the appeals
court ruling sets a dangerous precedent.
   The ruling ``erects formidable new barriers against antitrust
challenges to publicly conducted price-fixing boycotts,'' the FTC
said. ``The tax-paying public, no less than private parties, is
entitled to have its monies spent in markets in which all
participants obey the laws of competition.''
   The cases are FTC vs. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association,

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Federal National Guard Training in Massachusetts
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to bar the
federal government from requiring certain peacetime training for
any state's National Guard troops without first getting the
governor's consent.
   The justices, without comment, left intact a 1986 federal law
prohibiting governors from withholding permission for such training
missions.
   The law had been challenged by Massachusetts officials.
   Today's action does not preclude the possibility that the issue
could some day return to the nation's highest court.
   Since 1933, each person joining the National Guard
simultaneously enlists in two distinct organizations _ the Army or
Air National Guard of a particular state and the Army or Air
National Guard of the United States.
   The first organization serves as the state's militia; the second
as a reserve component of the national armed forces.
   Congress in 1986 passed the so-called Montgomery Amendment after
several governors voiced opposition to the Reagan administration's
Central American policy and said they would withhold their consent
to National Guard training missions in that region.
   The 1986 law prohibits any governor from withholding consent to
a National Guard unit's active duty outside the country because of
an objection to the location, purpose or schedule of such duty.
   A National Guard unit in Massachusetts was designated to
participate in a Central America training mission in mid-1988, but
Gov. Michael Dukakis objected.
   State officials sued the Department of Defense in federal court,
alleging that the 1986 law is unconstitutional.
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton upheld the law, and the 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last Oct. 25.
   The dispute centered on seemingly competing provisions in the
Constitution.
   One enpowers Congress ``to raise and support armies,'' including
``calling forth the miltia.''
   The other leaves to individual states the ``training of the
militia.''
   Judge Keeton ruled that a state's authority to train National
Guard members must yield to ``the legitimately exercised power of
Congress to raise and support armies.''
   Keeton's ruling relied, in part, on a 1918 Supreme Court
decision that upheld Congress' authority to draft members of a
state militia into the national armed forces during World War I.
   The judge discounted arguments by Massachusetts authorities that
a state's authority to supervise the training of National Guard
members is absolute during peacetime, and can be taken over by the
federal government only in times of national emergency.
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
declared the Montgomery Amendment unconstitutional after the law
was challenged by Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich.
   That ruling currently is under review by the entire 8th Circuit
court.
   Urging the justices to reject Massachusetts' appeal, Bush
administration lawyers said, ``It would be incongruous to hold that
the Constitution gives Congress the power to establish these
reserves as components of the national armed forces but ...
withholds (federal) authority ... to conduct their training.''
   The administration lawyers added, ``Such a view would not only
undercut the effectiveness of the national defense but would also
inject the states into matters of foreign policy that the
Constitution reserves to the federal government.''
   As of 1986, Army National Guard members provided 46 percent of
the Army's combat units and 28 percent of its support forces.
   For fiscal year 1987, the Air National Guard members provided 73
percent of the nation's air defense interceptor forces and 25
percent of its tactical fighter forces.
   The case is Massachusetts vs. Department of Defense, 88-1223.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ordered the dismissal
of a challenge to a rule that generally requires Los Angeles city
court employees to speak only English while at work.
   The justices instructed the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to
take such action after being told that the woman who challenged the
rule no longer works for the city court.
   The rule was adopted by the southeast judicial district of the
Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1984.
   The rule bars court employees from speaking any language other
than English, except when acting as translators or during breaks
and lunchtime.
   The regulation was challenged by Alva Gutierrez, a
Hispanic-American who was a deputy court clerk. Ms. Gutierrez is
bilingual, and one of her duties was to translate for
Spanish-speaking members of the public that have business before
the city court.
   She said the English-only rule discriminates against her and
other minority group members based on their race and national
origin.
   The 9th Circuit court last year upheld a federal judge's
injunction barring enforcement of the rule pending further
developments in Ms. Guitierrez' suit.
   The appeals court also rejected arguments that the city judges
who adopted the rule are immune from being sued.
   The appeals court said while some employees who speak only
English may feel threatened by conversations in Spanish between
other workers, that is no legitimate basis for a discriminatory
policy.
   ``Existing racial fears or prejudices and their effects cannot
justify a racial classification,'' the appeals court said. The
fears of people who do not understand Spanish do not amount to a
``business necessity'' warranting the ban, the appeals court said.
   It noted that the federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission properly has warned that barring workers from speaking
their native tongue on the job may contribute to racial tension.
   Acknowledging that the California Constitution has been amended
to recognize English as the state's official language, the appeals
court said the amendment is primarily symbolic and does not mandate
that English be the only language spoken by public employees.
   The case is Municipal Court of Los Angeles vs. Gutierrez,
88-1395.

<TEXT>
   A jailhouse lawyer whose litigation helped
transform the Idaho State Penitentiary is free after 21 years
behind bars.
   Walter ``Bud'' Balla was released from the prison south of Boise
on Friday. He was not scheduled for release until August, but
Corrections Director Richard Vernon said Balla had found a job and
a place to live, so officials let him go.
   In 1984, Balla, who had only a high school education, and fellow
inmate Dean Schwartzmiller won a federal court victory declaring
the 680-inmate prison overcrowded and lacking in basic services.
   The suit brought about improvements at the prison and
construction of a new maximum-security facility.
   American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Stephen Pevar in Denver
called the court-mandated reforms ``the single most important thing
that has happened'' to Idaho prisons.
   Corrections officials reluctantly agree, although they dismiss
most of Balla's prison-rights suits as frivolous.
   ``Every state has their Balla,'' Vernon said. ``He just happened
to be Idaho's.''
   Balla, 44, was sent to the penitentiary in 1968 for robbery. He
escaped and was recaptured three times and was serving time for
slashing a guard's throat during a breakout in 1978.
   Robert Gray, a Kodiak, Alaska, contractor who knew Balla when
they were teen-agers in Medford, Ore., told officials that the
inmate would have a job and a place to live if he came to Alaska,
and Balla was granted early release.
   Gray said he had forgotten Balla until a few months ago when he
read about an inmate complaining about the prison cable TV system
failing during the Super Bowl.
   ``He's got capabilities,'' Gray said. ``It's too bad he's spent
so much of his life wasting away in prison.''
   Between connecting flights in Seattle, Balla called The Idaho
Statesman to say, ``I'm free and I don't know how to act.''
   ``I've got an opportunity and I'm going to make it work,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Fires burned out of control in Beirut's
devastated streets today after artillery and rocket exchanges
between Christian and Moslem fighters killed 41 people in less than
48 hours.
   Police said 156 people were wounded in the bombardments that
began at dusk Saturday between army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's
largely Christian army units and his Syrian and Druse adversaries.
   Police said the bombardment was the heaviest since the battles
broke out March 8, plunging Lebanon into a fierce round of fighting
some fear may be the ``final battle'' in Lebanon's 14-year-old
civil war.
   Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, called
for an emergency meeting of the Arab League council to take
``urgent measures ... to stop the massacre in Lebanon.''
   The sheik, who heads an Arab League mediation committee on
Lebanon, called the meeting after three cease-fire appeals by his
six-man panel failed to curb the hostilities.
   The latest casualties raised the overall toll from 41 days of
almost non-stop bombardment by both sides to 258 killed and 913
wounded, by police count.
   Beirut was without electricity and the water-pumping system came
to a standstill after the capital's main power plants were shut
down at noon Sunday when they ran out of fuel.
   Among those killed during the weekend was Spain's ambassador,
Pedro Manuel de Aristegui. The 61-year-old diplomat died Sunday
along with his wife's Lebanese father and sister and a bodyguard
when his villa suffered a direct hit.
   The envoy's wife, Jomana, suffered severe head wounds when the
240mm shell struck their home in the Hadath suburb of Christian
east Beirut. She was hospitalized in critical condition.
   Beirut residents had hardly emerged from basements and bunkers
during a brief lull this morning when the guns and rocket launchers
thundered into action again, sending people scurrying back to their
shelters.
   A few bakeries opened today, but there was not enough bread for
residents who ventured out to replenish food supplies.
   Hundreds of burned-out cars lay smoldering on streets littered
with broken glass and severed power cables. Hundreds of shops and
other buildings were gutted.
   Fires burned out of control in several residential districts of
Christian east Beirut, where police said more than 1,200 autos were
destroyed by shellfire in the latest blitz. Many buildings burned
down because fire engines had no water to battle the fires.
   The nine-story Information Ministry building, which also houses
the state-run Radio Beirut station, was gutted by a barrage of 30
artillery shells. The station remained off the air for a second day.
   The smoke-blackened building is next door to the office of
acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a mostly Moslem Cabinet
that is vying for legitimacy with a Christian military Cabinet
headed by Aoun.
   Hoss met today with France's visiting Minister for Humanitarian
Assistance, Bernard Kouchner, who is trying to arrange a mercy
mission to evacuate casualties and bring in fuel and medical
supplies.
   A source close to Hoss, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
a dozen Moslem victims of the fighting might be evacuated from west
Beirut to the French Navy hospital ship, Rance, at nightfall ``if
security conditions permit.''
   Fourteen Christians were ferried to the Rance on Friday.
   The fighting was touched off by a blockade Aoun clamped on
illegal militia-run ports that have cost the government about $100
million a year in lost customs revenue.
   The Druse Progressive Socialist Party retaliated by shelling the
Christian enclave.
   The Syrians, who maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon's Moslem
areas under a 1976 Arab League mandate, soon joined the Druse in
fighting the Christians.

   A U.S. biologist took over today as
general-secretary of The International Council for the Exploration
of the Sea, becoming the first American to head the world's oldest
intergovernmental organization.
   Emory Anderson of Kenmare, N.D., was elected to head the
18-nation organization for a six-year term. He previously was the
council's fisheries officer and statistician.
   The council was set up in 1902 to carry out marine and fishery
science, and advise European nations on fish stocks, quotas and
marine pollution.
   ``We try to keep out of politics and fisheries management,''
Anderson said. ``But we're sometimes the source of controversy.''
   He said the council's greatest challenge was ``making people
recognize their responsibility for common resources.''
   Prior to the mid-1970s, when countries extended their national
jurisdictions to 200 miles, there was virtual anarchy among fishing
nations, Anderson said. Nothing changed until fish stocks were
decimated, he said.
   Anderson said the North Sea, where cod and haddock are severely
depleted, was the most over-fished ocean in Europe. He said fishing
in North Sea waters should be cut by 80 percent to replenish stocks
to a sufficient level.
   Council members are Belgium, Canada, Denmark, East Germany, West
Germany, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Britain, United States and the
Soviet Union.

   President Bush's slightly altered plan to
protect deposits in failed savings and loans will consume the
Senate's attention this week, while Speaker Jim Wright's troubles
and the recommended closing of 86 military bases dominate House
action.
   Bush's plan would cost a minimum of $157 billion, two-thirds of
it from taxpayers, over the next 10 years to shore up the
government's deposit insurance funds after raids on it by
often-fraudulent savings and loan operators.
   The S&amp;L insurance fund is at least $25 billion in the hole
because of overly speculative loans, insider deals and in some
cases outright thievery by thrift operators using federally
protected deposits.
   The House ethics committee charged today that Wright violated
official rules of conduct 69 times by not disclosing thousands of
dollars in alleged gifts and by skirting rules on speaking fees
through bulk book sales.
   The committee also cleared Wright of several allegations,
including one that he improperly intervened with S&amp;L regulators on
behalf of Texas thrift operators and friends.
   The House also is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution by
New Jersey, California and Illinois lawmakers to reject a federal
commission's recommendation last year to close 86 military bases.
   Among the base closings that would begin in 1990 unless the
resolution is approved are the Army's Fort Dix and Presidio bases
in New Jersey and San Francisco and the Air Force's Chanute
training base in Illinois.
   Lawmakers hope to make this a shortened work week, taking off on
Thursday to mark Passover. But with the S&amp;L deficit growing by an
estimated $600 million to $1 billion a month, Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has vowed to bring them back on
Friday if they do not complete action on Bush's package before the
holiday.
   Lawmakers and presidential candidates in both parties closed
their eyes to the problem during last year's election campaign
while the Federal Home Loan Bank Board was committing some $38
billion to close or merge more than 200 insolvent S&amp;Ls, half of
them in Texas.
   The bailout package before the Senate would come up with the
balance needed to pay for that, $50 billion more needed to handle
another 350 institutions now or near insolvency plus another $33
billion to cover losses of additional thrifts expected to go under
by 1999.
   Together, the costs _ none of which will ever be recovered _ are
more than double the amount of aid, repaid loans and loan
guarantees that the government put up for the Marshall Plan to
rebuild Europe after World War II and the Chrysler, Lockheed, New
York City and Penn Central bailouts combined.
   Toward Bush's stated goal of ``never again,'' the president's
plan also would require S&amp;Ls effectively to double _ from $3 to $6
_ their own capital at risk for every $100 they lend as an
inducement to be more prudent.
   The legislation also replaces the independent and traditionally
industry-friendly Home Loan Bank Board with the stricter
bank-insuring Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and a new Treasury
office as the industry's regulators.
   The Senate Banking Committee last week weakened Bush's reform
proposals somewhat by continuing to allow a variety of non-owner
assets to count as capital through government-approved though
widely criticized accounting practices.
   M. Danny Wall, the bank board's chairman, would keep his job
under Bush's proposal and the Senate committee's bill, but likely
would lose it in a version moving through the House.
   Challenges to Wall's continuance in office and Bush's financing
plan, and an effort to set aside for poor and low-income families
some of the housing that has fallen into the government's hands
through S&amp;L loan defaults, may surface on the Senate floor this
week.
   Under Bush's plan, the bailout will be financed with $50 billion
raised through 30-year bonds to be issued by a new quasi-government
corporation. This lets Bush avoid having to include the costs in
his federal deficit calculations, while taxpayers pick up about $5
billion and the S&amp;L industry $300 million of the annual interest
costs of the bonds.
   An on-budget, up-front financing plan by House Banking Chairman
Don Riegle, D-Mich., was defeated in committee last week despite
Riegle's contention that it would have saved taxpayers $4.5 billion
in interest costs over the next 30 years.

<TEXT>
   A court today convicted a 23-year-old
Palestinian of spying for the Moslem guerrillas who are trying to
overthrow the country's Soviet-backed government.
   Meanwhile, guerrilla reports in Pakistan claimed the insurgents
had breached the southern defenses of the eastern Afghan city of
Jalalabad after a six-week siege.
   However, diplomats in Kabul, the Afghan capital, said the
government may have succeeded in reopening the highway from the
capital to Jalalabad. The U.S.-backed guerrillas had destroyed a
bridge to close the road during their offensive.
   In the Kabul trial, the Special Court for National Security said
the defendant, Abdul Razaq, deserved the death penalty. However,
the court said it commuted his sentence to 16 years in prison
because he asked for mercy. The court said he could appeal.
   The three-judge panel found the man guilty of illegally entering
Afghanistan, military spying, collaborating with insurgents, and
trying to persuade government soldiers to defect to neighboring
Pakistan.
   Razaq admitted entering Afghanistan illegally, but he said he
came only to preach Islam.
   ``I am not a professional killer,'' he told the court. ``I came
to make peace between two (guerrilla) commanders. I am not a spy.
My objective was to remove tension between two disputing sides.''
   He was arrested last December by government troops who stormed a
guerrilla hideout in northwestern Afghanistan, prosecutors said.
   He said his home was a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan.
   On April 5, the court convicted two Pakistanis of spying for
their government. One was sentenced to 16 years in prison, the
other to 18 years.
   The most powerful anti-government forces are based in Pakistan,
which supports their fight.
   The Afghan News Agency, mouthpiece of the seven-party guerrilla
alliance based in Pakistan, today quoted a guerrilla commander
identified as Fazli Haq Muhajid as saying the insurgents had broken
Jalalabad's stiff southern defenses.
   Al-Bunyan News Service, linked to the guerrillas' fundamentalist
Ittehad-i-Islami Party, said battles raged around the headquarters
of the Afghan Army's 81st Brigade south of the city.
   However, there were no immediate reports of casualties and no
independent confirmation.
   The diplomats in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity, gave
no details in reporting the highway from Kabul to Jalalabad may be
open again. However, they said a convoy of about 65 trucks with
weapons and ammunition left today for Jalalabad.
   The city, where an estimated 100,000 people now live, was the
guerrillas' first major objective since Soviet troops withdrew from
Afghanistan two months ago. They had intervened nine years before
in support of Marxist rulers.
   The city's capture would be a major morale boost for the
guerrillas, who earlier predicted that the country's government
would quickly collapse without the Red Army's help.
   In other fighting today, government troops battled for the fifth
day to dislodge guerrillas who had cut the Salang highway running
north from Kabul to the Soviet Union. The blockade has prevented
hundreds of trucks carrying food and fuel from reaching the capital.
   The guerrilla reports also said there was heavy fighting near
Khost, another eastern garrison town about 78 miles south of
Jalalabad. They claimed guerrillas killed or wounded 350 government
troops and captured five tanks, two armored personnel carriers, and
some heavy weapons over the weekend.
   Those reports were also impossible to confirm.

   The Supreme Court, in a case involving a
notorious Mexican drug-smuggling operation, today agreed to decide
whether U.S. law enforcement agents need a warrant before searching
on foreign soil someone who is not an American citizen.
   The court said it will hear Bush administration arguments that
U.S. agents did not violate the Constitution when, without a
warrant, they searched the home of a suspected Mexican drug
smuggler.
   Rene Verdugo Urquidez was convicted in California last year of
taking part in the 1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of Drug
Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique Camarena and his pilot,
Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Verdugo, identified as a top lieutenant to Mexican drug kingpin
Rafael Caro Quintero, is serving a sentence of 240 years plus life.
He is not eligible for parole for 59 years, when he would be 96.
   Verdugo's conviction and sentence in the murders is not at issue
in the case the Supreme Court acted on today. His appeal centered
on a separate drug-smuggling conviction.
   In other cases acted on the court:
   _Agreed to decide whether states may tax television evangelists'
sales of religious books, tapes and other merchandise. The justices
said they will review rulings that forced the Louisiana-based Jimmy
Swaggart Ministries to pay California $183,000 in back taxes and
interest for the years 1974 through 1981.
   -Refused to bar the federal government from requiring certain
peacetime training for any state's National Guard troops without
first getting the governor's consent. The justices left intact a
1986 federal law prohibiting governors from withholding permission
for such training missions. The law had been challenged by
Massachusetts officials.
   -Asked the Bush administration for its view on whether U.S.
banks with branch offices overseas must pay depositors after
foreign governments seize or freeze those accounts. The court
invited Justice Department lawyers to comment on rulings that
required Citibank to pay depositors.
   At issue in the Verdugo case is whether the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals properly suppressed evidence obtained by the DEA
in its search of Verdugo's Mexicali, Mexico, home in 1988.
   Verdugo was arrested by Mexican police in 1986 and was turned
over to U.S. authorities in California.
   While he was awaiting trial, the DEA got permission from Mexican
authorities to search the home. The agents seized a tally sheet
they said shows the quantities of marijuana smuggled into the
United States by Verdugo.
   A federal judge in California ruled that the evidence is
inadmissible because the U.S. agents failed to obtain a warrant in
a U.S. court. The judge also said the search was unreasonable
because it was too general, occurred after midnight and the DEA
failed to leave an inventory in Verdugo's home of the evidence
seized.
   The 9th Circuit court upheld the judge's ruling.
   The appeals court said the agents had a legitimate goal and
praised them for ``aggressive and laudable pursuit'' of drug
smugglers.
   But the appeals court said the agents are not free to ignore the
Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which generally requires a court
warrant before any government search of a home is conducted.
   While Verdugo is a foreign citizen who lived outside the United
States ``he is being prosecuted for alleged violations of United
States law in a United States court,'' the appeals court said. ``We
can discern no conceivable reason why he should be denied the
protection of the Fourth Amendment.''
   The appeals court acknowledged that a search warrant issued by a
judge in this country has no legal authority in Mexico.
Nonetheless, the appeals court said, ``We cannot relieve the
government from its obligation to obtain a search warrant simply
because the place to be searched ... is outside this country.''
   A search warrant issued by a judge in the United States
demonstrates that an impartial magistrate believed there was
probable cause to conduct the search, the appeals court said.
   Justice Department lawyers said the DEA agents received
assurances from Mexican government officials that the search was
lawful there without a warrant.
   The government's appeal said the 9th Circuit court ruling could
have serious consequences for U.S. law enforcement efforts on
foreign soil.
   The DEA has offices in 45 nations, and last year helped in
investigations that led to 1,200 arrests of suspected drug
smugglers in foreign countries.
   The case is U.S. vs. Verdugo-Urquidez, 88-1353.

   _That Wright's friend and business partner, Fort Worth, Texas,
real estate developer and investor George Mallick, improperly
provided $145,000 worth of gifts over a 10-year period. The
committee found that Mallick had a direct interest in legislation
before the Congress, making it a violation of House rules for
Wright to accept more than $100 in gifts in a calendar year.
   _That Wright failed to report the benefits he received from
Mallick as gifts on his annual financial disclosure forms. The
items deemed ``gifts'' by the ethics committee included free
housing from 1979 through 1984 in Fort Worth, valued at $31,698;
cut-rate housing from 1985 through 1988, valued at $21,790; an
$18,000-a-year salary paid to Wright's wife, Betty, from 1981
through 1984, totaling $72,000; and the use and maintenance of a
1979 Cadillac from 1983 through 1988, valued at $19,391.
   _That Wright had ``an overall scheme'' to evade House limits on
outside earned income by, in seven instances, selling bulk
quantities of his book ``Reflections of a Public Man'' to groups to
which he had delivered speeches. The panel said that action, in
effect, converted money that should have been speaking fees _
limited under House rules _ into book royalties, which are not
under the limits. In an eighth instance, the panel said, Wright
received an undisclosed gift because books paid for by a private
individual were not delivered.
   Of the 116 total allegations of rules violations originally
raised by the committee's outside counsel, Chicago attorney Richard
Phelan, 47 were dismissed. Those involved Wright's alleged lobbying
on behalf of a constituent with whom he had an interest in oil and
gas wells, lobbying of federal savings and loan regulators, using
congressional staff members to produce his book, use of campaign
funds to pay for the book's publication and loan transactions
involving Mrs. Wright and Mallick's wife, Marlene.

<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Janez Drnovsek said
today the spread of democracy in this communist nation cannot be
stopped and suggested the country could join a west European trade
organization within five years.
   Drnovsek, a 38-year-old economist elected in Yugoslavia's first
Western-style election, said a suggestion Yugoslavia join the
European Economic Community was ``not realistic'' now. The call
came from the official Communist youth union last week.
   But he said he could envisage membership in the European Free
Trade Association, whose members are Austria, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.
   Yugoslavia could adapt its terms of trade to those of the
six-nation grouping over a five-year period, said Drnovsek.
   In a 90-minute meeting with reporters, Drnovsek took a largely
conciliatory but anti-Serbian stance when answering questions about
how to solve ethnic tensions and an economic and political crisis.
   Serbia, under its communist leader Slobodan Milosevic, wants to
maintain a centralized, one-party system, measures it says will
bring down the 400 percent inflation and a $21 billion foreign debt.
   In contrast, Drnovsek stressed that ``the concentration of
economic power ... should not be confused with political
centralization.''
   He also spoke out against ``nationalist tendenices''
complicating the situation in the Serbian province of Kosovo, where
riots killed at least 24 people last month.
   Drnovsek said his direct election as Slovenia's representative
to the nine-member collective presidency shows democratization
``has begun and will not stop.''
   The spread of democracy ``may stop for a short while in one
place or another ... but it cannot be halted altogether,'' he
emphasized.
   ``I am convinced that very soon we will arrive at a more liberal
development in Yugoslavia. Anything else is unacceptable and could
have tragic consequences.''
   Yugoslavia hopes new liberal laws will encourage foreign
investment, but Drnovsek said the country will continue trying to
reschedule or write off debt repayments. He blamed the U.S. budget
deficit for high interest rates that he said complicate repayments.
   Drnovsek and the new representative from Yugoslavia's smallest
republic, Montenegro, were the only people directly elected to the
collective presidency in Western-style elections.
   In Serbia and Croatia, representatives were named by the party
and approved in rubber-stamp legislatures.
   The country's other two republics, Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Macedonia, still are considering how to elect their
representatives, who sit for five years.
   Drnovsek will serve one year as president.

<HEAD>Escaped Convict Returns After 28-Year Absence</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP ) _ An inmate who escaped from prison 28
years ago and lived under his father's name has returned to serve
out his term.
   ``When I die, I want my own name on my tombstone,'' Sylvan
Carter, 61, said in an interview in today's The Columbus Dispatch.
   Carter surrendered at a Cincinnati TV station last week and is
being held at the London Correction Institution pending further
action, Tessa Unwin, a spokeswoman for the Department of
Rehabilitation and Correction, said today.
   Carter, convicted of possession of a burglary tool _ a crowbar _
in 1960, was sentenced to one to five years in prison. He walked
away from an honor farm at the London prison 30 miles west of
Columbus in 1961.
   If convicted of escape, he could receive three years in jail.
   Carter said he has lived in New Orleans and Houston since his
escape and was known as Willie Edward Carter. But after the death
of his brother and his wife, he decided to turn himself in.
   ``What I really wanted to do was wait until the corn around
London got 6 foot high and go into the cornfield and come out at
the prison and tell everyone I got lost (for 28 years). But I
thought better of that idea,'' he said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Bars New York Man from Pauper Appeals in Ohio Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For only the second time in its history, the
Supreme Court today permanently barred someone from appealing to it
as a pauper after ruling that he failed to prove he cannot afford
the filing fees.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that Curtis Wrenn of Fort
Drum, N.Y., may never again submit a so-called pauper's petition _
unless he can show his financial circumstances have changed
significantly for the worse.
   Unless granted pauper status, anyone who appeals to the high
court must pay $200 in filing fees plus significant printing costs.
   The court, in a four-page, unsigned opinion, noted that Wrenn
has filed 22 appeals to the court since 1986 and the court has
denied him pauper's status 19 times. One one occasion, Wrenn paid
the $200 fee.
   Wrenn, who is black and works in the Army's Wilcox Medical
Clinic, said he was a victim of racial discrimination by the
Toledo, Ohio, Mental Health Center and the Ohio Mental Health
Department.
   Wrenn said Ohio officials first refused to hire him as an
assistant programs superintendent in 1978. Later, he was hired but
said he then was fired in 1980 because of racial bias.
   In legal papers accompanying his appeal to the Supreme Court,
Wrenn said his yearly salary is $27,700 and he is $60,000 in debt.
   The court once before issued a similar previous opinion, on Feb.
21 denying pauper status to a man who had appealed to the justices
73 times since 1971.
   The justices said today they have a responsibility to allocate
the court's limited resources in the interest of justice for all.
   ``We do not think justice is served if the court continues to
process (Wrenn's) requests to proceed (as a pauper) when his
financial condition has not changed from that reflected in a
previous filing,'' the court said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the
court was wasting more time by preparing and enforcing the order
resticting Wrenn's ability to appeal than would be ``consumed by
the routine denial of frivolous'' appeals.
   Also dissenting were Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall. They repeated past concerns that denying pauper status
could be a dangerous precedent that cuts off worthy appeals.
   The court receives some 2,300 appeals a year by people who say
they are too poor to afford the filing fees.
   The cases are Wrenn vs. Benson, 88-6494, and Wrenn vs.
Department of Mental Health, 88-6497.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Marks Anniversary of Day It Took Control of Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Khmer Rouge commemorated today as
the 14th anniversary of the date it took power in Cambodia, and the
communist guerrilla group also pledged to keep fighting Vietnamese
invaders who later ousted it.
   Fears of a return to power by the Khmer Rouge, which killed
hundreds of thousands of people during its three-year reign, have
heightened since Vietnam announced this month it will pull out its
50,000 troops by Sept. 30.
   ``Today ... our entire people put on their best clothes and
joyously celebrate their national day ... with the firm conviction
that their struggle will score final victory against the Vietnamese
enemy aggressors,'' Khmer Rouge radio said Sunday. The text of its
broadcast was available today in Bangkok.
   Vietnam ousted the Khmer Rouge when it invaded in late 1978 and
installed a new communist government in Phnom Penh.
   That government also marked the anniversary _ but not as a Khmer
Rouge triumph. Instead, Phnom Penh radio called the day a
``historic victory over the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys''
in a broadcast monitored in Bangkok.
   It went on to say that Khmer Rouge leaders betrayed this victory
and ``plunged the Cambodian motherland into a deep ravine of deat.''
   The Khmer Rouge entered the capital, Phnom Penh, on April 17,
1975, toppling the U.S.-backed government of Lon Nol. Today, the
United States and China are key supporters of the Cambodia
resistance, which unites the Khmer Rouge with two non-communist
factions.
   After entering the capital, the Khmer Rouge dragged many
residents to labor camps in the countryside. It eventually killed
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians in its attempt to create a
model agrarian society.
   In its broadcast, the Khmer Rouge station said Vietnam should
bow to guerrilla demands and allow the United Nations to monitor
its withdrawal. The guerrillas have said the Vietnamese-installed
government should step down.
   The station said Hanoi's pledge to remove its troops was merely
an attempt to deflect international criticism. It claimed Vietnam
is hiding thousands of troops in Cambodia by dressing them as
Cambodian soldiers.
   Nguyen Van Linh, chief of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, will
go to Moscow on Thursday for talks with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Vietnam's pullout from Cambodia, Japan's Kyodo news
service reported today in a dispatch from Hanoi. The Soviet Union
is the main backer of Vietnam.
   In a letter today, about 1,000 survivors of the Khmer Rouge's
labor camps and torture chambers asked leaders of the warring
factions to incorporate human rights provisions into any peace
settlement. They said pledges are needed to ensure the Khmer Rouge
horror is not repeated.
   The letter was sent to Hun Sen, prime minister of the
Vietnamese-backed government in Cambodia; and to the two leaders of
the non-communist guerrilla groups, Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son
Sann.

<TEXT>
   In using his wife's career as a line of
defense against ethics charges, House Speaker Jim Wright has struck
a sensitive chord among his colleagues who fear they could be
subject to the same scrutiny.
   ``Every member who has a spouse that works'' is concerned, says
House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif.
   A major charge leveled by the 12-member House ethics committee
against Wright is that he accepted improper gifts from a business
partner with interest in legislation, according to the committee's
report released today.
   The panel viewed the $18,000 a year that Wright's wife, Betty,
received from a Fort Worth business partner, George Mallick, not as
a salary for part-time investment advice but as a gift. House rules
prohibit members from accepting more than $100 a year in gifts from
anyone with direct interest in legislation.
   In a counterattack last week, Wright described his wife's
lengthy career, including her job with the House Public Works
Committee, and cited the scores of other congressional spouses who
work.
   ``Some members' wives are attorneys. Some of them sell real
estate. Some of them teach school. Some of them work for local
school boards and local units of government. Some work for the
executive branch of government. Some work for other members of
Congress,'' said the Texas Democrat.
   Wright raised the specter of Congress examining spouses' work,
and the concern among members was evident.
   ``I think that saying any money to a spouse is a gift, as a
woman that offends me. Most spouses I know that work, work,'' said
Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo. ``I do think that spouses' income is
something that we need a very clear guideline. But I am offended
that anybody would make the supposition that any income to a spouse
is a gift.''
   Mary Regula, wife of Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, and president of
the Congressional Club made up of House and Senate spouses,
wondered whether it was possible to set definite rules.
   ``How could you limit the life of another person's career?''
Regula said in a telephone interview from her home in Ohio. ``How
could you even put together a bill without getting into
constitutional rights?''
   The Congressional Club has not conducted an official survey on
whether member spouses work, but Regula estimates about 70 percent
are employed either part-time or full-time.
   Careers cover a wide range of fields and Regula wondered why the
emphasis was on wives rather than husbands.
   ``Pat Schroeder's husband practices law. He has a lucrative
practice. No one has checked his client list,'' Regula said. ``Lynn
Martin is married to a federal judge and Congress votes on their
salaries.''
   A random check of other members found that Stewart Boxer,
husband of Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., is a partner in an Oakland
law firm that has handled a number of workers' compensation cases.
Deborah Dingell, wife of Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., works for
General Motors. Pamela Kostmayer, wife of Rep. Peter Kostmayer,
D-Pa., runs a public relations firm.
   Washington also is filled with high profile, two-career couples.
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., serves as minority Leader while his wife,
Elizabeth, is the labor secretary. Lynn Cheney is the head of the
National Endowment for the Humanities while her husband, Dick, a
former congressman from Wyoming is defense secretary.
   Back in 1977, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., the primary author of a
set of rules revisions, said examination of spouse's income is a
responsibility of the IRS, not Congress.
   Wright alluded to that this past week in defending his wife's
career.
   ``A far as I know, it never has been suggested nor contemplated
in the rules that the Congress would seek to question the
appropriateness of a wife's or a spouse's engagement in personal or
private professional business,'' Wright said.
   Betty Wright served as an administrative assistant on the House
Public Works Committee in the early 1970s and was paid $23,884
annually, putting her 26th on the salary list of the 87-member
committee staff.
   She then went to work for Mallick, providing investment advice.
But according to the House ethics committee's outside counsel, Mrs.
Wright only worked a total of 12 days from 1980 to 1984.
   Mallick has said he can find a number of witnesses who will
attest that Mrs. Wright worked for the money she was paid.
   Wright is not the first member of Congress to have his spouse's
career raise questions. Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., came under
close scrutiny when his wife, Antoinette, received $55,000 from
Greek businessman Basil Tsakos.
   Hatfield said the payments were for his wife's real estate
services and had nothing to do with his support of a trans-Africa
oil pipeline promoted by Tsakos.

   Israeli soldiers today shot and killed a
13-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy in clashes with
stone-throwing Palestinian protesters, Arab hospital officials said.
   The teen-agers both died in violence in the occupied territories
stemming from funerals for victims of earlier clashes. The girl was
killed in the occupied West Bank, the boy in the occupied Gaza
Strip.
   The boy was shot as Palestinians threw stones and set fires
during a funeral for a 50-year-old man from the Gaza Strip who died
earlier in the day of a reported beating March 27 by Israeli
soldiers.
   The army confirmed the death of the man without giving its
cause, and a spokesmen said they were checking the other reports.
   Arab reports also said six Palestinians were wounded during
today's clashes. The victims included a 9-year-old boy shot in the
leg at the Faraa refugee camp in the West Bank, the reports said.
   With today's deaths, 438 Palestinians have been killed in the
16-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. Eighteen
Israelis also have died.
   Today's killing in the West Bank occurred at the Dheishe refugee
camp outside Bethlehem, where several hundred angry youths, some
carrying outlawed PLO flags, burned tires and stoned Israeli cars
at the end of a burial ceremony. They were mourning a 17-year-old
killed Sunday in a clash with soldiers.
   Israeli soldiers responded by opening fire, shooting 13-year-old
Rafideh Khalili Ahmad Abu Laban in the forehead, Arab reporters
said. They said she died en route to a hospital.
   Hospital officials identified the 14-year-old boy who was killed
as Kayed Mousa Salama. They said he died at Shifa hospital in Gaza
City after a bullet sliced an artery in his leg when soldiers
opened fire in the nearby Jabaliya refugee camp.
   Arab reports said the troops fired on youths who rioted during a
funeral for Faris Said Falha, who died earlier in the day. Arab
sources said he had been beaten by troops during a search in the
camp.
   Protests also occurred today in the Golan Heights, which Israel
annexed after seizing it from Syria during the 1967 war. About 500
Druse Arabs demonstrated in the town of Majdal Shams, shouting
pro-Syrian and pro-PLO slogans and burning tires in honor of Syrian
Independence Day, witnesses said.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today separated Ferdinand Marcos
from a $100 million racketeering case because of ill health,
leaving his wife to stand trial without him.
   Prosecutors reversed themselves earlier this month and conceded
the 71-year-old deposed Philippine president was too sick to stand
trial for the forseeable future.
   Marcos has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 in Honolulu, where he
has lived in exile since his ouster in 1986. He suffers from heart,
kidney and lung problems.
   Prosecutors withdrew their objection to separating Marcos from
the case April 6 after a government doctor examined him for the
second time.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan signed an order placing the
case against Marcos in limbo. Keenan did not dismiss the charges.
The judge noted that the government could resume its case against
Marcos if his health improved.
   Most people close to the case say a recovery is unlikely.
   No trial date has been set for his wife, Imelda.
   The Marcoses, eight others and the California Overseas Bank are
accused of siphoning more than $100 million from the Philippine
treasury and funneling it into this country for the purchase of New
York real estate and art.
   Mrs. Marcos and the bank are the only defendants that have been
arraigned on the charges. The others, except Marcos, are fugitives.

   Fire erupted at an LTV Steel Co. coke plant,

   The blaze broke out around 9 a.m. in a building that handles
combustible gas produced in the baking of coal into coke, which is

   Flames flared above the plant for more that 3{ hours after the
accident. Health officials suggested that people with breathing

   Five people were burned and four had other injuries, said police
spokeswoman Margaret Rizza. They were taken to four hospitals.
   An undetermined amont of oil was discharged into the Monongahela

it, Ms. Rizza said.
   The plant, which employs about 900 workers, was shut down. It is
one of four operated by Cleveland-based LTV and is a major source
of coke for blast furnaces in Cleveland and East Chicago, Ms.
Kuvalish said.

<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee charged today that
House Speaker Jim Wright violated official rules of conduct 69
times by not disclosing thousands of dollars in alleged gifts and
by skirting rules on speaking fees through bulk book sales.
   The committee _ six Democrats and six Republicans _ unanimously
approved the statement of alleged violations, announced the
chairman, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif.
   Less than two hours later, Wright defended himself in a speech
to a Washington labor meeting and asked for a speedy end to the
matter.
   ``I know in my heart I have not violated any of the rules of
that institution,'' Wright said.
   ``I have today requested very urgently that ... I be given the
privilege of coming this afternoon, today, right now or tomorrow or
the next day, surely within a week to confront them, to confront
the allegations head-on, face-to-face.''
   The charges, divided into five counts, and an accompanying
report by Richard Phelan, the attorney who conducted the
committee's investigation, could jeopardize Wright's future as
speaker.
   The statement ``represents a determination by the committee that
in 69 instances, there is reason to believe that Rep. Wright
violated the code of official conduct and other House rules which
apply to him as a member of Congress,'' Dixon said.
   He emphasized that the committee's action is similar to an
indictment _ based on a comparatively low standard of proof _ and
not a conviction.
   ``The speaker of the House has not been found guilty of any
violations but from a review of the evidence the committee has
found a reason to believe'' violations may have occurred, Dixon
said.
   ``We have not reached any final conclusions on the matters that
are still under investigation,'' he said, telling reporters that,
for further proceedings, the standard will be ``clear and
convincing evidence.''
   The committee, under its rules, will next allow Wright to
respond within 21 days.
   After that, the committee has 30 days to decide whether to hold
a ``disciplinary hearing'' on whether Wright indeed violated rules
and what punishment, if any, it should recommend to the full House.
   The panel cleared Wright of several accusations filed against
him last year when the inquiry began, including alleged use of a
staff member to write the book, improper use of campaign funds and
improper lobbying on behalf of constituents.
   The most controversial lobbying effort by Wright was the
pressure he put on federal regulators to go easy on Texas thrift
institutions that were failing due to a weak economy. Although the
speaker ``may have been intemperate'' in his efforts, the committee
was not persuaded, Dixon said.
   In all, Phelan found 116 alleged violations, and the committee
dismissed 47 of those.
   The committee will continue its investigation into an allegation
surrounding the investent in an oil and gas well by Wright and
Mallick. The committee has issued subpoenas in that case, he said.
   ``I am prepared to appear as early as Monday afternoon, but
certainly the committee should be able to schedule a hearing within
seven days,'' Wright said in a letter sent to the committee Sunday
night.
   ``I continue to believe that I have not violated any House
rules, and I am absolutely certain that I have never knowingly or
intentionally done so,'' Wright said in the letter.
   But Dixon told a news confrence the committee had just received
the letter and did not know when Wright would appear.
   As for the 69 charges, the committee determined that apparent
gifts from Wright's business partner, George Mallick, appeared to
be improper because the Fort Worth, Texas, developer had a direct
interest in legislation'' and had not been properly reported to the
House.
   ``The nature and extent of the apparent gifts from Mr. Mallick
indicates that Rep. Wright did not exercise reasonable care to
avoid even the appearance of impropriety, which is the hallmark of
the House gift rule,'' Dixon said.
   The committee said the $145,000 in gifts included free or
cut-rate use of a condominium in Fort Worth, an $18,000-a-year
salary paid Wright's wife, Betty, and free use of a car.
   Dixon said the committee also charged that Wright skirted House
limits on speaking fees through the sales of his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   ``In the committee's view, seven bulk sales of the Rep. Wright's
book... demonstrated an overall scheme to evade the House outside
earned income limit because (speaking) honorarium payments were
recharacterized as royalties.''
   The House will ultimately be Wright's jury, and Wright last week
launched an effort to blunt the impact of the charges and keep his
majority Democrats in line.
   Following news reports that the committee had concluded it had
``reason to believe'' that Wright violated House rules in dozens of
instances, Wright on Thursday gathered his top lieutenants for a
half-hour-long statement in the Capitol.
   The speaker gave his version of the main charges against him,
and with quivering voice vowed to fight for his reputation and that
of his wife. He appealed to other House members with working
spouses by strongly stating that Mrs. Wright earned the salary she
was paid by Mallightco, the partnership the Wrights had with
Mallick and his wife.
   Wright's second in command, Majority Leader Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., went on television Sunday and urged people not to judge
too quickly.
   Asked if Wright would be crippled politically even if he beat
the charges, Foley said: ``No, I don't believe that and I think we
have to be terribly careful that we don't let accusation bring
about its own taint of guilt.''
   Foley appeared on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley''
opposite Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., a close ally and adviser to the
man who first brought the charges against Wright, Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga.
   Weber, while saying that judgment should be withheld, said he
believed the charges against Wright were ``much more substantive''
than just ``some technical violations that any member might have
inadvertently committed.''
   The investigation of Wright was triggered by a complaint filed
with the ethics committee last May by Gingrich, a persistent critic
of Democratic leadership in the House and of Wright in particular
who is now the House minority whip.
   Although Common Cause, a good government group, was in his
corner, Gingrich's maneuver at first was seen mostly as a political
tactic. Many expected it would quickly be brushed away by the
panel, perhaps even before last July's Democratic National
Convention.
   However, the committee undertook a sweeping investigation led by
Phelan, the Chicago attorney it hired for the case. A Democrat,
Phelan dispelled GOP suspicions that he would go easy on the
speaker.
   His probe, which lasted through the winter and cost an estimated
$1.5 million, presented the committee with a voluminous report on
the speaker's dealings.
   Even if the committee votes against sanctioning the speaker, GOP
leaders have promised to keep Wright a political issue.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., has said he would use
House rules to force a vote on the committee report. Republicans
would try to use that to portray themselves as anti-corruption and
anyone who votes against them as corrupt.

   Does ``The Big Chill'' leave you cold? Tired of
hearing ``oldies'' older than you on TV commercials? Three
exasperated young upstarts say, ``Right on!''
   The reminder that the calendar says 1989 comes from the National
Association for the Advancement of Time _ three guys in their 20s
who say ``We want to end the '60s in your lifetime.''
   ``Let's make nostalgia a thing of the past!'' say these fellows
who've had enough of the baby boom _ that huge post-World War II
generation whose sheer bulk spurred creation of the retail market
for teen-agers, divided the nation over Vietnam and now is taking
up space discovering adulthood _ marriage, careers and babies
destined to grow up hearing stories about Woodstock.
   Anti-nostalgia crusader Eugene Dillenburg dismisses baby boomers
as ``50 million teenagers who never grew up.''
   But they won't go away.
   ``There's so many of them. If they want to live in their past,
that's fine _ but they're forcing ME to live in their past,''
gripes Dillenburg, 29, of Chicago. He founded NAFTAT with friends
Bruce Elliott of Los Angeles and John Keeney of New York City.
   Here's a sampling from Dillenburg's long list of complaints:
   Movies _ ``The Big Chill.''
   Theater _ the revival of ``Hair.''
   Television _ ``The Wonder Years.''
   Print Media _ Bob Greene's nationally syndicated Chicago Tribune
column.
   Books _ volumes on the riotous 1968 Democratic National
Convention in Chicago, ``as insignificant an event as ever happened
in this country.''
   NAFTAT is part of a natural anti-boomer backlash, according to
Northwestern University sociologist Bernard Beck, who says any
cultural statement that lasts too long ``seems to generate
resentment.''
   By failing to step aside ``the way it's supposed to,'' the
baby-boom generation has ``thrown out of kilter the ordinary
succession of generations,'' Beck said.
   ``There always has been disdain toward this generation because
there's so many of us in it,'' observed Greene, singled out by
Dillenburg as a sort of arch-boomer. Greene defends nostalgia,
saying readers of all ages respond to his columns about the past.
   But when Dillenburg and Elliott got together in 1987 and
discovered their mutual exasperation with ``oldies'' radio, they
decided it was time to get the Monkees off their backs.
   Preserve what is worth remembering from the '60s _ the Beatles,
Bob Dylan and the civil rights movement, for example _ and scrap
the rest, Dillenburg suggests.
   NAFTAT cranks out leaflets calling on sympathizers to ``fight
for the present and annoy a lot of self-important ex-hippies in the
process.''
   Today's young people may not go in for demonstrations, but they
care about apartheid and other issues, he said.
   NAFTAT's feelings about the baby boomers are not altogether
different from the reaction the post-war generation got from their
``silent majority'' elders 20 years ago, Beck said.
   Many parents waited through the Depression and World War II to
have children, and their offspring ``grew up being told by everyone
around them _ and believing _ that they were the most important
thing in the world,'' he said.
   ``They are endlessly fascinated with their own lives,'' he said,
and their vast numbers make every setback ``central cultural
business.''
   The message baby-boomers send to others, Dillenburg said, is:
``You missed the '60s _ your life is meaningless. Your life is
irrelevant because it came after mine.''

<HEAD>First Soviet Troops to Leave East Germany May 11</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The first contingent of Soviet soldiers and
military hardware to be withdrawn from East Germany under a plan
announced by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will leave May 11, the
Tass news agency said Tuesday.
   Gorbachev announced the unilateral troop cuts at the United
Nations on Dec. 7. The withdrawal is expected to be completed by
Aug. 15, the official news agency said.
   Gorbachev said there would be an overall troop reduction of
500,000 men, or 12 percent of the total Soviet troop strength, and
the military budget would be cut by 14 percent. The cuts apply to
troops based in Eastern European countries that are members of the
Warsaw Pact alliance.
   Army Gen. Boris Snetkov, who commands Soviet forces in East
Germany, was quoted by Tass as saying that more than 10,000
personnel, about 1,000 tanks, more than 330 artillery and mortars
and nearly 5,000 motor vehicles will be withdrawn from the nation
before the middle of August.
   Remaining units will be restructured to take on a more defensive
posture, Snetkov said.

   A radio bomb confiscated from
suspected Palestinian terrorists exploded at federal police
headquarters today as experts tried to defuse it, killing one
officer and critically injuring another.
   A similar bomb disguised as a radio is believed to have caused
the explosion that blew Pan Am Flight 103 out of the sky Dec. 21
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
   The Federal Police Bureau initially reported two officers were
critically injured in today's explosion. Bundeskriminalamt
spokesman Arno Falk said later that one of policemen had died.
   Brunhilde Spies-Mohr, a spokeswoman for the federal police
bureau or Bundeskriminalamt, said in Wiesbaden:
   ``During investigation of a suspicious device suspected of
containing explosives, a detonation occurred.
   ``The material that exploded was a device obtained during
investigation of Palestinian terrorists.'' The explosives were
hidden in a radio receiver, she added.
   The blast occurred in a basement room of the federal police
headquarters, Ms. Spies-Mohr said.
   Part of the Bundeskriminalamt building was evacuated after the
explosion while bomb disposal experts disarmed a second device, she
said.
   An identical radio-bomb containing plastic explosives and an air
pressure-sensitive detonator was seized during an Oct. 26 raid on
an apartment used by suspected Paletinian terrorists in the city of
Neuss.
   It was not immediately clear where the bomb that exploded in the
federal police headquarters came from.
   One unofficial source who did not want to be identified said it
was the same bomb confiscated in the Neuss raid. But that device
has been handled repeatedly by West German and foreign
investigators in their probe of the Pan Am crash, and was presumed
disarmed long ago.

   Lech Walesa still gives the impression
that he could be spending his days repairing electric carts at the
Lenin Shipyard.
   Instead, he is usually to be found negotiating with the interior
minister, meeting with foreign heads of state and leading the
Solidarity movement that has changed his country's course.
   The story of Walesa scaling the shipyard fence to inspire
strikers in forming the East bloc's first independent trade union
is often repeated, but should not lose its significance: Poland has
not been the same since that day in August 1980.
   Walesa, 45, has never lost the authenticity with which he drew
millions to his vision of workers' solidarity.
   On Monday, he chalked up his latest victory, leading Solidarity
through seven years of repressions to regain its legal status, just
as he vowed to do.
   The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, a man of deep Roman
Catholic faith, intended to travel to Rome on Wednesday to thank
Polish-born Pope John Paul II for the church's role in helping to
bring about the agreement with authorities.
   Walesa wears a suit and tie these days, but always with a
picture of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa icon and a Solidarity
pin on his lapel. He usually also sports a U.S. vice-presidential
tie pin given him by George Bush in 1987.
   But he remains a modest person, often answering his home
telephone himself and riding the early morning train from Gdansk on
his frequent trips to Warsaw for high-level meetings with Polish
authorities.
   When in Warsaw, he stays in a small cloister cell at the church
episcopate. After a long night of negotiations, he sometimes
travels the four hours back to Gdansk to sleep in his own bed.
   Complaining of a bad cold, he decided to stay in Gdansk on
Monday when a court in Warsaw formally registered Solidarity again
as a legal trade union independent of the government.
   Walesa's autocratic leadership style bothers some in the union.
And although he is a spell-binding orator, his statements to
reporters can sometimes be as cryptic as an oracle's pronouncements.
   A natural politician who goes with his gut, Walesa ignored
warnings that he was giving in too easily in September when he put
his reputation with workers on the line by ending a series of
strikes nationwide in return for a vague promise of talks from the
government.
   Although some youthful militants chanted ``Down with Walesa!''
in the months that followed, he never seemed to doubt the decision.
   Many Solidarity activists point to Walesa's convincing showing
in a nationwide TV debate in October as the turning point that
brought about the talks which won Solidarity its legalization.
Walesa apologized for his poor performance.
   Much has changed in Poland during the eight months since the
August strikes, but not Walesa.
   He marked his conclusion of an historic accord with the
government on April 5 not at the celebratory cocktail party at a
government palace, but by eating dinner in a nearly deserted hotel
dining room with an aide.
   ``I am exhausted and I don't like eating standing,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poll: Abortion Ban Won't Stop Abortion</HEAD>

   Though a sizable minority of adults oppose
abortions, Americans overwhelmingly believe that banning them would
do little to curtail them, a Media General-Associated Press survey
has found.
   With the U.S. Supreme Court poised to reconsider the issue next
week, the national poll found support for legal abortion ranging
from 50 percent to 65 percent of the 1,108 adults polled, depending
on the question posed.
   Fifty-three percent, for example, were in favor of the court's
1973 ruling legalizing abortion in the first three months of
pregnancy. And if the court reversed itself and let each state make
its own abortion law, 57 percent would want abortion legal in their
state.
   Moreover, large majorities said outlawing abortion would fail to
prevent it from occurring _ an argument used by those who argue
many women would have unsafe illegal abortions if the operation
were banned.
   The poll asked: ``If abortion were illegal in your state, do you
think that would stop most women there who want abortions from
having them, or would most of them go to another state where it was
legal?'' Eighty-seven percent said the women would go to another
state.
   The survey next asked if making abortions illegal nationwide
would stop most women from having them, or if those women would
have illegal abortions or go to a country where abortion is legal.
Seventy-three percent said most women would find a way to have
abortions.
   The survey nonetheless found its closest split on the question
of a constitutional amendment to make abortions illegal except in
cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother: Fifty
percent were opposed and 44 percent in favor, a division within the
poll's margin of error.
   No amendment with those provisions is before Congress, but they
are the terms President Bush has said he would support.
   Because the wording of questions on such a sensitive issue can
affect the results, the poll posed the matter in a variety of ways.
The findings on basic attitudes toward abortion were similar in
other recent surveys.
   One question asked: ``Should abortion be legal as it is now;
legal only in such cases as rape, incest, or to save the life of
the mother; or should it not be permitted at all?'' Fifty percent
said legal as now, 39 percent said legal in some cases, 7 percent
wanted it banned and the rest were unsure.
   CBS News and The New York Times have asked the same poll
question since 1985, tracking a slight increase in support for
current law. Depending on the questions, though, other polls have
found slight declines in support for legal abortion, and others
still have found no change.
   In another question, outside the legal context, the poll asked:
``If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to it,
should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not?'' Sixty-five
percent said yes, 25 percent said no and the remaining 10 percent
had no opinion. The CBS-Times poll has found a similar response to
that same question.
   Opposition to abortion was greatest among older, less wealthy
and less educated respondents, and Republicans and conservatives.
There was no significant division in opinion between men and women.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control say 1.3 million
abortions are performed annually in the United States, making it
one of the nation's most common surgical procedures. Next week, the
Supreme Court is to hear a case that could enable it to review its
1973 ruling legalizing abortion, with a decision expected later in
the year.
   On related issues, the Media General-AP survey found:
   _ Widespread opposition to protests by Operation Rescue, the
anti-abortion group whose members have been blocking entrances to
abortion clinics around the country. Sixty-seven percent opposed
those demonstrations, 22 percent supported them and 11 percent were
unsure.
   _ Narrow opposition to the use of federal funds to help poor
women with their medical bills if they want an abortion. Forty-nine
percent opposed such spending, 41 percent were in favor. The rest
did not answer.
   _ Fifty-one percent support for legalization in the United
States of RU486, a drug developed in France that stops very early
pregnancy by preventing the fertilized egg from being implanted in
the uterine wall.
   Anti-abortion groups call the drug an abortion pill and threaten
boycotts against any drug company that produces it. Supporters call
it simpler and safer than surgical abortion. In the poll, 51
percent said it should be legal here, 24 percent said not and 25
percent were unsure.
   The poll was conducted March 6-15. Media General Inc., a
communications company based in Richmond, Va., publishes the
Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa (Fla.)
Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and operates TV
stations WXFL in Tampa, WCBD in Charleston, S.C., and WJKS in
Jacksonville, Fla.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews March 6 to 15 with 1,108 adults in
the continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly
and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most
recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be the within 3 points of the poll's results,
19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to
it, should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not? Yes: 65
percent. No: 25 percent. Don't know or no answer: 10 percent.
   2. Should abortion be legal as it is now; legal only in such
cases as rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother; or should
it not be permitted at all? As now: 50. In cases: 39. Not at all:
7. DK-NA: 4.
   3. Would you favor or oppose a constitutional amendment that
would make abortions illegal except in cases of rape, incest or to
save the life of the mother? Favor: 44. Oppose: 50. DK-NA: 5.
   4. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that states cannot
prevent a woman from having an abortion if she wants one at any
time during the first three months of pregnancy. Do you favor or
oppose that ruling? Favor: 53. Oppose: 41. DK-NA: 6.
   5. If the Supreme Court reversed its 1973 ruling and let each
state make its own abortion laws, abortion could become legal in
some states and illegal in others. Would you want abortion to be
legal or illegal in your state? Legal: 57. Illegal: 37. DK-NA: 7.
   6. If abortion was illegal in your state, do you think that
would stop most women there who want abortions from having them, or
would most of them go to another state where it was legal? Stop: 7.
Go: 87. DK-NA: 6.
   7. If abortion was illegal in every state, do you think that
would stop most women who want abortions from having them, or would
most of them have illegal abortions or go to another country for
abortions? Stop: 20. Go: 73. DK-NA: 7.
   8. A group that opposes abortion has been holding demonstrations
where its members block the entrances to abortion clinics until the
police arrest them and carry them off. How do you feel about these
demonstrations _ support them strongly, support them, oppose them,
or oppose them strongly? Support strongly: 4. Support: 18. Oppose:
37. Oppose strongly: 30. DK-NA: 11.
   9. A pill is now available in France that stops pregnancy by
preventing the fertilized egg from becoming implanted in the
uterine wall. Do you think this drug should be legal in the United
States, or not? Yes: 51. No: 24. DK-NA: 25.
   10. I'd like to ask your opinion on this statement: The
government should help a poor woman with her medical bills if she
wants an abortion. Please tell me whether you agree or disagree.
Agree: 41. Disagree: 49. DK-NA: 11.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Actions at a Glance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, is a rundown of Monday's
major actions by the Supreme Court.
   
   DRUG SEARCH WARRANT
   
   The court, in a case involving a notorious Mexican
drug-smuggling operation, agreed to decide whether U.S. law
enforcement agents need a warrant before searching on foreign soil
someone who is not an American citizen.
   The court said it will hear Bush administration arguments that
U.S. agents did not violate the Constitution when, without a
warrant, they searched the home of a suspected Mexican drug
smuggler.
   Rene Verdugo Urquidez was convicted in California last year of
taking part in the 1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of Drug
Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique Camarena and his pilot,
Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Verdugo's conviction and sentence in the murders is not at issue
in the case the Supreme Court acted on Monday. His appeal centered
on a separate drug-smuggling conviction.
   The case is U.S. vs. Verdugo-Urquidez, 88-1353.
   
   NATIONAL GUARD - GOVERNORS
   
   The court refused to bar the federal government from requiring
certain peacetime training for any state's National Guard troops
without first getting the governor's consent.
   The justices, without comment, left intact a 1986 federal law
prohibiting governors from withholding permission for such training
missions.
   The law had been challenged by Massachusetts officials.
   Congress in 1986 passed the so-called Montgomery Amendment after
several governors voiced opposition to the Reagan administration's
Central American policy and said they would withhold their consent
to National Guard training missions in that region.
   The case is Massachusetts vs. Department of Defense, 88-1223.
   
   EVANGELISTS - TAXES
   
   The court agreed to decide whether states may tax television
evangelists' sales of religious books, tapes and other merchandise.
   The justices said they will review rulings that forced the
Louisiana-based Jimmy Swaggart Ministries to pay California
$183,000 in back taxes and interest for the years 1974 through 1981.
   Lawyers for Swaggart's organization argue that the California
tax, as applied, violates religious freedom.
   The case is Jimmy Swaggart Ministries vs. Board of Equalization,
88-1374.
   
   MURDER CONFESSION
   
   The court agreed to consider reinstating the murder conviction
of a New York City man who confessed to killing his former
girlfriend after police illegally arrested him at his home.
   The court said it will review a ruling that threw out Bernard
Harris' conviction because his confession was used as evidence
against him.
   The ruling is being appealed by Bronx prosecutors.
   The New York State Court of Appeals last October ruled that
Harris is entitled to a new trial on charges stemming from the
stabbing death of Thelma Staton.
   The case is New York vs. Harris, 88-1000.
   
   PAUPER APPEAL
   
   For only the second time in its history, the Supreme Court
permanently barred someone from appealing to it as a pauper after
ruling that he failed to prove he cannot afford the filing fees.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that Curtis Wrenn of Fort
Drum, N.Y., may never again submit a so-called pauper's petition _
unless he can show his financial circumstances have changed
significantly for the worse.
   Unless granted pauper status, anyone who appeals to the high
court must pay $200 in filing fees plus significant printing costs.
   The court, in a four-page, unsigned opinion, noted that Wrenn
has filed 22 appeals to the court since 1986 and the court has
denied him pauper's status 19 times. One one occasion, Wrenn paid
the $200 fee.
   The cases are Wrenn vs. Benson, 88-6494, and Wrenn vs.
Department of Mental Health, 88-6497.

   A gatekeeper said today he refused
police orders to open an outer gate and allow thousands of late
arrivals to pour into a soccer stadium where 94 fans were crushed
to death. Fans and officials said police opened the barrier.
   South Yorkshire police, who were in charge of Saturday's club
semifinal at Hillsborough stadium, came under mounting attack as
Liverpool ordered a week of mourning for victims who came to watch
the city's team play play Nottingham Forest.
   Fans and officials said officers responded inadequately and far
too slowly when spectators were crushed against a steel anti-riot
fence in a standing-room-only area.
   Gatekeeper Jack Stone told the Yorkshire Post he refused police
orders to open a 16-foot-wide outer gate. Survivors said about
4,000 fans outside were pushing at turnstiles.
   Stone would not confirm survivors' reports that police officers
opened the concertina gate. But he told the newspaper: ``You know
as well as anyone whose fault it was.''
   Liverpool fan Stephen Mitton told British Broadcasting Corp.
television: ``The steward put his hand on the gate and said, `Don't
open it.' The police said, `Open the gate. There's going to be a
crush.' Then two police officers opened the gate.''
   New arrivals poured in, pressing those inside against the
10-foot fence. Mounted police herded them into the overcrowded
center terrace, some fans said today.
   The crush was so great, Mitton said, that fans fell on the floor
and people climbed over them. ``All the police were doing was
standing up saying `get back, get back.' There was already people
dead then. I climbed on them to get over the fence.''
   South Yorkshire's Chief Constable Peter Wright said Saturday a
senior officer decided to open the gates ``to save people's lives
and to relieve the crush outside.''
   He said he was not aware of any connection between the gate
being opened and the surge on the standing section, where many
victims died.
   One of those being trapped in the front of the terrace, Stephen
Hendry, 19, said: ``People were screaming at the police to open the
gate (at the front of the terrace) and three fans managed to climb
over the fence, but no sooner had they got out than one of them was
thrown back over by a copper.''
   Paul Middup, a Police Federation representative, said today the
growing public criticism of police actions was ``grossly unfair.''
   ``They were faced with a situation for which no amount of
training could prepare them,'' he said.
   In Parliament today, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd announced an
independent inquiry to determine the cause of what Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher called ``a disaster of immense proportions.''
   Hurd said major soccer clubs may be told to replace
standing-room terraces with seats _ as lawmakers and sports
officials are demanding.
   ``We owe a duty to these passionate supporters of football
(soccer) to examine urgently and thoroughly the causes and
background and to do all in our power to prevent such a thing
happening again,'' Hurd said. ``We have to set our sights high and
find a better way for British football.''
   Lord Justice Taylor will lead the inquiry starting Tuesday, he
said.
   Police released the names of all 94 victims today, ranging from
a 10-year-old boy who was trampled and the 67-year-old brother of a
former Liverpool soccer player to two sisters who died before their
father's eyes.
   Businessman Trevor Hicks, 43, tried to resuscitate his two
daughters, Sarah, 19, and Victoria, 15, after they were pulled from
the crush of bodies.
   ``Football was the one thing we did as a family and now we are
not a family anymore,'' he said.
   All the victims were British. Thirty-four were teen-agers and 33
were in their 20s. Seven were women.
   Of the 170 injured, 47 remained hospitalized today, including 17
in intensive care.
   Liverpool soccer team members visited some of the injured fans,
as did Prince Charles and his wife, Princess Diana.
   South Yorkshire police, whose crowd-control measures will be at
the core of the inquiry, handed over the police investigation to
neighboring West Midlands police.
   Authorities will want to determine why thousands of fans still
were outside as the match began and examine charges that many
entered the sold-out stadium, which has a capacity of 54,000, with
forged tickets or no tickets at all.
   Sir Harry Livermore, a Liverpool lawyer and former Lord Mayor of
Liverpool, released a statement from a policeman whom he refused to
identify calling the police operation disorganized, ``pathetic''
and ``amateurish.''
   The Liverpool city council today called an official week of
mourning and discussed ways of helping the bereaved and injured.
   It was the third major soccer tragedy in four years involving
English teams, which have been barred from European soccer
competition since a May 29, 1985, rampage by Liverpool fans at
Heysel stadium in Brussels that killed 39 people.
   Europe's soccer authority last week lifted the ban on English
clubs playing in Europe in the 1990-91 season, pending a review
next April.

   A helicopter plucked a drug kingpin from a prison
yard today but crashed as it took off, seriously injuring the
inmate and pilot, officials said.
   The helicopter went down about 10 a.m. after a propeller caught
concertina wire atop the wall at the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center, authorities said.
   Benjamin ``Barry'' Kramer, a champion powerboat racer serving a
life sentence, and the pilot, whose identity wasn't immediately
known, were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital after the escape
attempt, said U.S. Marshal Daniel Horgan.
   ``Prison guards immediately extracted Kramer and the pilot out
of the wreckage and administered first aid. They were hurt quite
seriously,'' Horgan said.
   ``Ironically, they were taken by helicopter to the hospital,'''
Horgan said.
   Initial reports indicated the pilot suffered head, neck and back
injuries and Kramer, 34, fractured his left ankle, authorities said.
   MCC is the major prison for drug traffickers and others arrested
for federal crimes in South Florida.
   Among some 1,000 inmates are Miami policemen convicted of
running a drug ripoff ring and others convicted of large-scale
cocaine and marijuana trafficking or awaiting trial.
   Warden John Clark said that the helicopter reportedly hovered
just above the recreation yard and that Kramer grabbed onto a ski
and was either climbing into the craft or was aboard when it
crashed.
   Some witnesses said a second inmate may have tried to climb
aboard, he said.
   ``It appears he was ready,'' Clark said. ``According to
witnesses, he ran to the helicopter and jumped on as soon as it
swooped down.''
   The pilot was holding an identification for Charles Clayton
Sterns, but the warden said authorities suspect the ID may have
been for Kramer.
   Kramer was convicted in October in Illinois federal court of
running a continuing criminal enterprise and was sentenced to life
without parole under the ``drug kingpin'' law, Horgan said. Kramer
was brought here in December in connection with federal charges in
Florida for distribution of marijuana.
   Kramer was exercising in a portion of the prison for escape
risks, including anyone serving a life term, authorities said.
   The wrecked helicopter was a two-seat, Bell-model bubble type,
authorities said.

   Turkey on Monday deported three U.S.
citizens who were detained after proselytizing outside a movie
theater showing the film, ``The Last Temptaton of Christ,'' a U.S.
consulate official said.
   The three, who were identified as David Kim Wilson, 35, of
Chicago, his wife, Pamela Lynn Wilson, 32, of Des Moines, Iowa, and
Norma Cox, 45, of Chicago, were put on a Turkish Airlines flight to
Athens. Cox had been teaching English in Istanbul since 1981, while
the Wilsons were tourists, a consulate official said on condition
of anonymity.
   He said the Interior Ministry ordered the three deported for
proselytizing, which is against Turkish law.
   The three were detained on April 4 in front of a movie theater,
where they were handing out pamphlets protesting Martin Scorsese's
film.
   They were released after questioning on April 11 and were later
fined about $2 each for conducting unauthorized activities before
being deported.

<HEAD>Bush Announces Aid to Poland</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Inserts graf 6, Later in a, with Bush quote.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAMTRAMCK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today announced new U.S.
economic help for Poland, praising the Warsaw government's move
toward reform and saying ``we can and must answer this call to
freedom.''
   Bush traveled to the Polish-American city of Hamtramck, which is
surrounded by Detroit, to extoll the communist government's
agreement to reinstate the Solidarity trade union movement and to
hold the first free elections in Poland since before World War II.
   While the president announced a series of steps aimed at helping
Poland restore its battered economy, Bush said continued aid would
depend on consistent moves by the communist government toward
reform.
   ``We will not act unconditionally,'' he said. ``We will not
offer aid without requiring sound economic practices in return. We
must remember that Poland is still a member of the Warsaw Pact. We
must take no steps that compromise the security of the West.''
   The concessions could open the way for a flow to Poland of up to
$1 billion in new loans, loan rescheduling and trade and investment
relief, according to administration and international monetary
sources.
   Later, in a Polish restaurant in Hamtramck where Bush had lunch,
he was asked by reporters whether his package was intended to send
a message to the Soviet Union. ``It's a good, strong meessage and I
hope it was heard there and in Eastern Europe,'' Bush said.
   Administration officials, who declined to be identified, also
said Bush may travel to Poland in July, immediately before or after
the seven-nation economic summit in Paris.
   The trip would underscore U.S. support for Warsaw's landmark
April 5 steps restoring the legal status of the union Solidarity
and scheduling the first open elections in the communist-run
country since before World War II.
   Bush spoke to a crowd of several hundred people outside the
Hamtramck city hall. He received rousing applause when he said that
``today, this very day, the free trade union Solidarity was
formally restored.''
   Bush said the new agreements by the Polish government with the
Solidarity movement that it banned in 1981 should help Warsaw
arrange new loans from multinational lending organizations such as
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
   The sources said in advance of Bush's speech that could amount
to rescheduling up to $700 million in existing loans in an effort
to help Poland make a dent in its $39 billion international debt.
   Bush's package also called for a lowering of tariffs on selected
Polish imports through the Generalized System of Preferences, a
move that requires congressional approval.
   This system of preferential tariffs traditionally is used by the
U.S. government to assist less-developed nations.
   Bush also announced that he will seek congressional approval for
a program of U.S.-guaranteed loans, through the Overseas Private
Investment Corp., to stimulate private investment in Poland. He
also said he would propose negotiations that could lead to joint
ventures between U.S. and Polish businesses.
   Sources said that some of the proposed inducements would be
linked to future steps by Poland to liberalize its markets and make
changes in its long-troubled economy.
   ``If Poland's experiment succeeds, other countries may follow,''
Bush said. ``While we must still differentiate among the nations of
Eastern Europe, Poland offers two lessons for all.''
   ``First, there can be no progress without significant political
and economic liberalization,'' he said. ``Second, help from the
West will come in concert with liberalization. Our friends and
European allies share this philosophy.''
   ``The United States has never accepted the legitimacy of
Europe's division,'' Bush said. ``We accept no spheres of influence
that deny the sovereign rights of nations.''
   Yet, the president said, ``the winds of change are shaping a new
Europen destiny.''
   ``The Congress, the Polish-American community, the American
labor movement, our allies and international financial
institutions, must work in concert if Polish democracy is to take
root anew and sustain itself,'' he said. ``We can and must answer
this call to freedom.''

   Roman Popadiuk, a presidential spokesman, said he was aware of
the $1 billion figure that other administration officials had put
on the package, but that the White House would refrain from
assigning a pricetag because there were too many variables.
   The full impact of the aid package could only be realized if
other creditor governments went along with the proposed loan
rescheduling.
   Popadiuk said of the $39 billion in outstanding Polish debt,
only $2.4 billion is owed to the U.S. government.
   He said congressional approval of the plan to give Poland tariff
relief could provide benefits ranging from $3.5 million to $25
million, depending on what products are selected and on how
aggressively Poland makes use of the new opportunity to export more
goods to the United States.
   This nation imported $417 million in merchandise from Poland
last year, including textiles, steel, fish and ham; and exported to
Poland $304 million in goods, much of it in grain.
   A fact sheet distributed by the White House said that the
administration would work closely with Solidarity in deciding which
additional credits to grant the Polish government.
   The April 5 agreement called for free elections in June, and for
creation of a two-house parliament.
   The newly created 100-member Senate would be the Eastern bloc's
first freely elected legislative chamber. The government also
promised to make 35 percent of the seats of the existing 460-member
Sejm elective. An elective post of president would become available
in six years.
   The government also conferred full legal status on the Roman
Catholic Church in Poland.
   Bush's package further eases U.S. economic sanctions imposed
against Poland in 1981 and 1982 following declaration of martial
law and the outlawing of Solidarity. Some of the original sanctions
were lifted in 1987 after the Polish government moved toward
reconciliation with the union.
   U.S. officials reacted positively to Poland's steps to grant its
citizens mor freedom.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the Polish
movement toward new liberties ``a historic step'' and ``a great day
for the Polish people.''
   Still, administration officials have voiced caution.
   ``Poland has taken a step away from totalitarianism, although
democracy is far from having been achieved,'' Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said Friday.
   Bush visited Poland as vice president in September 1987 during a
nine-nation European tour.

   Three West Germans were arrested
Monday for trying to smuggle out of the country 32 exotic birds
worth about $150,000, police said.
   The three were taken into custody as they were boarding a flight

   The birds had been drugged and placed in tubular wire mesh cages
inside a suitcase, he said, adding that police also recovered a

   Actress Julie McCullough says she was
disheartened when sponsors dropped her as queen of the Azalea
Festival after complaints about her posing nude in Playboy magazine
four years earlier.
   ``In all the newspapers it came out that the people with the
festival agreed and I agreed that it wouldn't be in the best
interest of the festival for me to queen. But that was not the case
at all,'' said Ms. McCullough of ABC-TV's ``Growing Pains.''
   ``I was very upset and hurt when I was told that it wouldn't be

   Rebeca Arthur of ABC's ``Perfect Strangers'' replaced Ms.
McCullough as Queen Azalea for the 42-year-old festival, which took
place over the weekend in Wilmington, another coastal city.
   Ms. McCullough, who grew up in Jacksonville, visited friends
here and toured Wilmington with her parents, but did not go to the
festival.
   She said she has no regrets about appearing on the cover of
Playboy and as a playmate of the month in 1985, but would not do it
again.
   ``I honestly like to believe that I used the Playboy experience
to go on to something better ... and I will continue to move on to
better things,'' she said.

   Television personality Cristina Ferrare says
she is over the scandal from her marriage to automaker John
DeLorean and happy with her new family and blooming career.
   Miss Ferrare returned Monday to her spot as co-host of ``A.M.
Los Angeles'' after a five-week maternity leave for the birth of
Arianna, her second child with her husband, producer Tony
Thomopoulos.
   A former model, Miss Ferrare, 39, drew much publicity when
DeLorean was being tried on drug charges. She was criticized for
leaving him three weeks after he was acquitted in 1984.
   Miss Ferrare says she is no longer bothered by criticism, even
if it is from DeLorean, who has publicly accused her of
selfishness, treachery and stupidity since their divorce.
   ``I don't care anymore,'' she said. ``My husband loves me. I
love him. We're happy. I don't care what people think.''
   Miss Ferrare in January joined the nationally syndicated
``Home'' show with Robb Weller in addition to doing the Los Angeles
morning talk show with co-host Steve Edwards.

   American-born Queen Noor, who is traveling
to the United States with King Hussein on Tuesday, sees herself as
``as a bridge and means of communication between the Arab and
Islamic world and the West.''
   ``I think it's very important to convey a more realistic and
constructive image of Islam to the rest of the world, where there
is so much confusion and misunderstanding about the message, the
spirituality and the substance of Islam,'' she told The Associated
Press in an interview.
   Known as Lisa Halaby before she married the king in 1978, the
37-year-old queen has drawn on her background as a
Princeton-trained architect and planner to build a more than
ceremonial role for herself.
   She helps guide planning for new schools and hospitals, sponsors
a bedouin rug-weaving project, a civil aviation college, a music
conservatory, an environmental protection committee and a center
for early childhood education.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning author-historian
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. says the United States may be heading for a
new era of liberalism.
   ``I would even go so far as to say that George Bush's idea of a
kinder and gentler nation is a reflection of a changing popular
mood,'' the former White House aide to President Kennedy said in an
appearance Sunday night at the University of New Mexico.
   Schlesinger said President Reagan's administration succeeded
only as it ``began to yield to the rising force of liberalism.''
   ``We need our own home-grown version of Perestroika,'' he said,
referring Mikhail Gorbachev's effort to salvage the economy of the
Soviet Union, ``but we need not despair. The United States has the
resources to be a world leader for generations to come.''
   He said Bush's call for charitable efforts and volunteerism
probably cannot do the job, however.
   ``We have a thousand points of light,'' Schlesinger said, ``but,
alas, the batteries are not included.''

   While TV talk show host Morton
Downey Jr. was conducting forums at the University of Rhode Island,
someone let the air out of all four tires on his limousine, campus
police said.
   Downey, who specializes in deflating his guests with insults and
provocations, examined the the problems of campus fraternities
during his forums Sunday night, which were modeled on his TV show.
Two fraternities were banished from the Rhode Island campus this
year for various infractions.
   University President Edward D. Eddy, who stood in the back of
the hall, said he found Downey ``pathetic. Why anybody would pay
$10 for this kind of thing I don't understand.''
   Darren Klein, a sophomore from Orange, Conn., and a member of
the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, said he attended the forum to
``stand up for the Greeks.''
   ``Morton's all right, kind of fake, but he is entertaining,''
Klein said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer is trying to uproot
decades of populist political tradition and restructure Louisiana's
tax system in a test that may be a barometer of his political
future.
   Opposing him are anti-tax lawmakers, including former Ku Klux
Klan leader David Duke, and a tradition of making business pay the
bulk of the bills.
   Roemer says the state must lighten the tax burden on business to
create new jobs and get away from dependence on the petroleum
industry.
   An April 29 referendum is scheduled on a proposed constitutional
amendment authorizing the Legislature to make basic changes in the
tax structure. A new tax code approved by legislators during a
special session in late February and early March will take effect
if the amendment is approved.
   The Legislature convened Monday for its 85-day regular session,
but no major action is expected until after the election, when
lawmakers will have an idea of how much money will be available.
   Roemer wants a combination of personal income tax increases,
sales tax decreases and business tax breaks, along with a $1.5
billion improvement program for highways, airports and ports to be
funded by a net increase in gasoline taxes of about 1 cent per
gallon.
   Taxes on cigarettes and wine would go up. The plan also includes
a new balanced-budget measure in the state constitution and a trust
fund that would set aside mineral revenue should oil prices boom
again.
   The proposed changes chop at the roots of a populist tax system
that began evolving during the 1930s. Now, homesteads valued at
$75,000 are exempt from parish property taxes, businesses pay 95
percent of property taxes and annual auto license plate fees are $3.
   Petroleum companies have historically footed much of the bill
for state programs through severance taxes and leases on state land.
   In the early 1980s, oil and gas revenue amounted to more than 40
percent of the total state budget and the good times rolled in
Louisiana. But when prices fell and production was curtailed, the
state was thrown into one budget crisis after another. The state
now gets only 20 percent of its revenue from petroleum.
   Opponents claim Roemer's plan constitutes a $621 million tax
increase that will guarantee nothing for the state's economy,
plagued by the nation's highest unemployment rate at more than 11
percent.
   A recent statewide poll by Mason-Dixon Public Research indicated
that voters were about evenly split among support, opposition and
indecision.
   The total state budget is about $7.7 billion. If the tax
revision plan passes, Roemer says $234 million in reductions will
be needed to balance the budget. Without the plan, an additional
$485 million will have to be cut from the budget.
   The governor says he's too busy trying to rally public support
for his tax plan to worry about possible political implications.
   ``I'm not in this to be safe, to sit at home and say, `Well, you
know I couldn't try it because it's too risky,''' Roemer said.
   But Rep. Allen Bradley, a supporter of the tax plan, said the
package is ``clearly a Buddy Roemer tax package and, in a way, it
becomes a referendum on the governor.''
   On the other side is Duke, elected in February on an anti-tax
plank.
   ``He (Roemer) has said it will not hurt citizens on the lower
end of the income scale, but the increases will actually begin at
$25,000,'' said Duke.
   The governor counters that state income tax figures for 1987
showed that more than 70 percent of those filing returns made less
than $25,000.
   The Public Affairs Research Council, a government watchdog
group, said the first-year increase in state taxes would total $116
million. Personal taxes would increase in 1989-90 by $171 million
and business taxes would decline by $55 million.
   By 1992-93, businesses would enjoy a $219 million decrease from
current tax levels, PARC said. Personal taxes would rise to $218
million by 1992-93, leaving total state tax revenues at virtually
the same level as under the current structure, PARC said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lottery officials waited today for the holders of
four tickets to step forward and claim a world-record jackpot of
$69.9 million.
   Holders of the tickets, whether it's one person, a couple or a
group, will split the pot, which was raised from $69 million today
after final sales were tallied.
   Two people, one in Chicago and one elsewhere in Illinois,
contacted state officials Sunday to report they held winning
tickets, but Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said the tickets would
have to be validated before the millionaires could be annointed.
   Officials today tentatively identified one winner as a man from
west central Illinois who planned to share the winnings with his
two sisters from Arizona. He was on his way to Chicago to have his
ticket validated, said lottery spokeswoman Carrie Worley.
   ``For all of you who said it's easier to be struck by lightning
than to win the Lotto, four people were struck last night and they
struck gold,'' Ms. Sharp said Sunday at a news conference.
   Each winner would get a $17.25 million share of the grand prize,
paid over 20 years, said Lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem. The total
could rise after final sales figures are tallied, she said.
   The winning numbers were 3, 14, 32, 40, 46 and 54.
   Hopeful players from around the country and world descended on
Illinois last week, buying record numbers of tickets that enabled
lottery officials to boost the prize. Some rerouted flights, others
called from as far away as Europe, Japan and South America to find
out how to get a piece of the action.
   Losers said they were disappointed but took their losses in
stride.
   ``I just got one ticket because ... if you're going to win,
you'll win with one,'' said Lonny Taylor, a systems engineer from
Chicago.
   In addition to the four big winners, Ms. Sharp said Saturday's
drawing produced 1,220 players who matched five of the six numbers
to win prizes of $2,316.50, and 73,452 who will receive $76.50 for
matching four of six.
   The jackpot beat the old world record of $61.98 million set in
October in California. That pot was split among three winning
tickets, one bought by an individual and the others bought by
groups of co-workers.
   The previous Illinois record jackpot of $40 million was won by
Chicago printer Mike Wittkowski in 1984.
   Ms. Sharp said sales for the week _ $56.5 million _ eclipsed
totals for the week leading up to the $40 million jackpot in 1984.
She said sales on Saturday reached 27,000 tickets per minute.
   ``It was a little hairy there for a while,'' she said.
   Forty cents on every dollar in Lotto proceeds goes to the state
for the Common School Fund, Ms. Sharp said. But since the amount of
money spent on schools is determined by state budget figures, the
additional revenue from last week's record sales will go into state
coffers not specifically slated for education, she said.
   If only one person had matched the numbers, the jackpot would
have been the largest paid to a single winner.
   But with four ticketholders sharing the pot, the largest single
winner in U.S. history remains Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs,
Fla., who walked away with $55.16 million in the Florida lottery in
September.
   Florida's Lotto jackpot is on the rise again, to an estimated
$37 million in next Saturday's drawing, its second highest level
after Ms. Ryan's winnings, because nobody won this weekend's $23
million prize, Lottery secretary Rebecca Paul announced Sunday.
   ``We're urging players to purchase their tickets early this week
to avoid the possiblity of longer lines Friday and Saturday,'' said
Mrs. Paul, who helped Illinois set up its lottery before she moved
south to Florida.

   The inquest jury that exonerated British soldiers
in the killing of three alleged Irish terrorists in Gibraltar was
acting on incomplete evidence and sometimes conflicting testimony,
Amnesty International says.
   In a report published Tuesday that is likely to refuel the
controversy over the killings on March 6, 1988, the human rights
movement renewed its demand for a judicial inquiry, saying the
inquest failed to allay suspicions of ``an official policy of
deliberate planned killings of suspected members of armed
opposition groups.''
   It said the inquest was conducted properly, but believed that
the verdict, although reached fairly, was based on ``evidence which
from the outset was incomplete.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office said it had seen the
report. ``As far as we are concerned the whole matter has been
fully considered (by the inquest) and we see no grounds for opening
up a fresh inquiry,'' said a spokesman, requesting anonymity.
   The government has faced persistent questions over the killing
of Mairead Farrell, Daniel McCann and Sean Savage by a
secrecy-shrouded military unit believed to have been flown in from
Britain.
   The government said it acted on intelligence the three were
armed and plotting to detonate a car bomb in the tourist-packed
center of the British colony on the southern Spanish coast. The
Irish Republican Army acknowledged the three were members sent to
Gibraltar ``on active service.''
   But it quickly emerged the three were unarmed and that their car
contained no bomb, and witnesses later said at least two of the
suspects appeared to be trying to surrender to the plainclothes
officers confronting them.
   The government said it feared they might have remote-control
devices to detonate the explosives if they were given too much time
to surrender.
   Angrily rejecting Amnesty International's call for an inquiry,
Mrs. Thatcher said an inquest would answer the questions. Seven
months later, the inquest jury ruled 9-2 that the killings were
lawful.
   Amnesty International sent three observers to the inquest, led
by Stephen Owen, a lawyer and ombudsman of the Canadian province of
British Columbia.
   Its report comes two weeks after a British trial lawyer, Hilary
Kitchin, who also observed the inquest, wrote that it fell short of
international legal standards and raised questions about the
legality of the killings.
   Amnesty International's report said: ``Details about government
policy, the planning of the operation, and the quality of the
intelligence were not revealed.''
   It said Spanish police, who had been involved in tracking the
three to the Gibraltar border, did not testify.
   Spanish testimony could have helped establish whether they were
known to be without guns or explosives. The absence of this
testimony also made the evidence incomplete, the report said.
   It said much forensic evidence was destroyed ``because standard
procedures were not followed,'' while the state pathologist was
denied adequate post-mortem facilities and ballistics reports.
   ``Most of the key independent civilian eye witnesses were
discovered by media journalists and not by the police,'' said
Amnesty International.
   ``The organization is also concerned that discrepancies between
witnesses' testimonies had not been resolved and that many
questions remained unanswered such as, for example, from what exact
position the soldiers had fired, and whether the suspects had made
attempts to surrender,'' the report said.
   Recalling past shootings in Northern Ireland in which police
were accused of killing when they could have made arrests, it said:
``The inquest has again failed to alleviate public concern that
these suspects were killed rather than arrested.''
   In an interview, Owen said Britain faced the challenge of
``keeping its composure in the face of sometimes intolerable
violence.''
   He said he was not accusing the British of stepping beyond the
law. ``I'm saying doubt remains that has to be resolved ... and
doubt is potentially very damaging to a representative democracy.''
   The IRA is fighting to rid Northern Ireland of British rule and
unite it with the Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Group Says Drug Linked to Sudden Death Syndrome Shouldn't be Sold
without Prescription</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug commonly prescribed for sedation and
relief of cold symptoms is linked to sudden infant death syndrome
and should not be sold without a prescription, a public interest
research group said Monday.
   Public Citizen Health Research Group urged the Food and Drug
Administration to reverse its decision allowing over-the-counter
sales of the drug known by the trade name Phenergan.
   ``Over-the-counter availability implies FDA designation of a
margin of safety which, in this case, is not justified,'' said
Andrew Holmes and Sidney Wolfe, physicians with the health research
group, in a letter to the FDA.
   The group filed a petition with the FDA four months ago to block
over-the-counter sales of the drug, but no action has been taken.
The group said the matter now deserves ``urgent attention'' because
nonprescription doses of the drug are scheduled to reach pharmacy
shelves in June.
   FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said the group's petition is under
review. The agency has 180 days to review such petitions, she said.
   The FDA last August decided that promethazine hydrochloride, the
active ingredient in Phenergan, could be used in over-the-counter
cough-cold products ``based on the fact there hasn't been a safety
problem to justify keeping it under prescription when used as
labeled and it is labeled not for use in children under 6,'' Cruzan
said.
   The drug is a phenothiazine, a class of major tranquilizers,
with antihistamine properties that offer some relief from cold
symptoms by drying the upper airways.
   It is manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. Company
spokeswoman Audrey Ashby said ``the FDA carefully reviewed all
data'' before making its decision and ``was satisfied the products
are suitable for over-the-counter sales.'' She added that ``in
their 35 years of marketing, these syrups have been remarkably
problem-free.''
   But the health group noted that although Phenergan is not
recommended for children under 2 years old, doctors wrote 175,000
prescriptions for the drug for that age group in 1985. It is often
prescribed for children with colic, Holmes said.
   A study in Belgium, where the drug is available without a
prescription, linked use with sudden infant death syndrome, or
SIDS, and found that it can cause obstruction of infants' breathing
passages during sleep, the health group said. The study found that
children who died of SIDS were 10 times more likely to have been
given Phenergan or a related drug recently than children in a
control group.
   About 5,000 infants die of SIDS each year in the United States.
Its cause is unknown, but Phenergan is believed to be a
contributing factor, the research group said.
   ``Even if only a small percentage of the U.S. SIDS deaths are
caused by prescription Phenergan, the increase in such deaths
expected with OTC (over-the-counter) availability adds up to a
senseless and avoidable tragedy,'' the letter said.
   Dr. Richard L. Naeye, chairman of the pathology department at
the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, has done
extensive research on SIDS and is one of the six experts who wrote
the FDA supporting the health group's petition. He said that while
studies have not proven a connection between SIDS and Phenergan
they have found an association between the two that needs more
study.
   ``It's an unresolved issue, but I don't think it's good to
resolve it by putting it on the market over the counter,'' he said.
   Naeye said that while he generally endorses the FDA's push to
make more drugs available without prescription, ``in this case,
it's not prudent.''

<TEXT>
   About a mile south of the tiny Tohono
O'odham Indian village of San Miguel, a pickup truck crossed from
Mexico through an open gate in the barbed wire that constitutes the
international border.
   The truck, carrying 500 pounds of cocaine, started along a
winding, dirt road known as Indian Route 19. It then headed north
for Tucson and to major U.S. cities for distribution.
   As the truck continued its journey, two U.S. Customs agents,
both Tohono O'odham Indians, popped onto the road in a
four-wheel-drive vehicle and chased it.
   U.S. agents took a .357-caliber Magnum, the $45 million cocaine
cache and the truck and charged 21-year-old Francisco Lopez Loya of
Chihuahua, Mexico, with conspiracy and other offenses.
   The March 23 arrest was similar to one played out almost daily
as federal, state and local law enforcement officers fight a
narcotics flood pouring across the border.
   The 360-mile-long Arizona border has become the latest
chessboard in the deadly game of drug trafficking, primarily
because of the success of anti-drug task forces in southern Florida.
   ``We have seen a tremendous increase in the amount of drugs
coming into Arizona from Mexico,'' said David S. Wood, chief agent
for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Phoenix. ``We're
able in many instances to trace it directly back to Colombia.''
   Wood said Arizona offers a variety of advantages to traffickers.
   ``It's a very porous border and then there is the human
connection because of family contacts'' on both sides that ``makes
it an ideal situation for the smuggler,'' he said.
   Other factors include the rugged terrain and sparse border
population _ only Douglas, Nogales and San Luis have populations of
more than 1,000; and the logistics _ one major Mexican highway runs
25 yards south of the border.
   ``They can throw a package over the fence, and it's in this
country,'' Wood said.
   An unprecedented rash of violence has accompanied the new drug
trade, authorities said.
   During the last three weeks, the bodies of five men, bound,
tortured and stabbed, were found in a Tucson shed; and in Agua
Prieta, Mexico, about 125 miles southeast of Tucson, the bodies of
nine men and three women were discovered similarly bound, tortured,
mutilated and shot. All had been dumped in a well or covered with
lime in a septic tank.
   Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said the Tucson and Agua
Prieta slayings ``are directly connected, with the same persons
responsible.''
   They have been characteristic of some of those of the notorious
Colombian Medillin cartel, said Thomas A. McDermott, the head U.S.
Customs Service agent in Arizona. ``We've seen that sort of
brutality in south Florida.''
   Authorities have not drawn any connection between the slayings
and the mutilations of 15 people near Matamoros, Mexico.
   The increased volume in drug trafficking and violence prompted
Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., to vow last week to press Congress
to fund the remaining $1.9 billion promised in last year's omnibus
drug bill. ``I'm prepared to raise taxes'' and to cut other
programs, he said.
   Border Patrol chief agent Ronald Dowdy, whose sector includes
most of the Arizona border, said his agents seized 85,000 pounds of
marijuana in fiscal 1988. ``To date, we have exceeded 107,000
pounds for fiscal '89, which began Oct. 1,'' he said recently.
   McDermott said the step-up in violence was anticipated as
cocaine seizures in Arizona soared from 100 pounds in 1985 to
almost 10,000 pounds a year currently.
   Larry Bagley, FBI special agent in charge in Tucson, said his
office now routinely gets numerous drug-related queries weekly from
Chicago, Philadelphia, Columbus, Ohio, and elsewhere on cases that
``all lead back to Tucson as the focal point, the funnel from which
the supply is coming. It's not so much Florida any more but Tucson,
Arizona. This is the distribution center.''

   Charles Kenny ``C.K.'' McClatchy, who
lambasted some fellow publishers for putting profit over news, was
remembered upon his death as a leader with ``the very highest
standards.''
   The 62-year-old editor and chairman of the board of McClatchy
Newspapers collapsed Sunday afternoon while jogging in a park, said
Erwin Potts, president of the company. He was pronounced dead a
short time later at the University Medical Center, apparently of
heart attack.
   Potts said McClatchy had no history of heart problems. ``He was
a very healthy guy and he took good care of himself. ... It's just
a shock to all of us.
   ``He was a hell of a newspaper man and he was a hell of a guy.
We're just going to miss him an awful lot,'' said Potts, who had
known McClatchy for 13 years.
   McClatchy was heir to a news empire that dated to the California
Gold Rush.
   His family's newspaper group publishes 12 West Coast newspapers,
including The Sacramento Bee; the Anchorage Daily News, which won
this year's Pulitzer Prize for public service; The Fresno Bee and
The Modesto Bee; and The Morning News Tribune in Tacoma and
Tri-City Herald in Washington state.
   Tom Johnson, publisher and chief executive officer of the Los
Angeles Times, called McClatchy ``a splendid newspaper leader who
represented the very highest standards of editorial and managerial
excellence.
   ``He was uncommonly dedicated to quality in his newspapers,''
Johnson said. ``His passing is a major loss to our profession.''
   McClatchy blasted fellow publishers in a January 1988 speech,
saying many paid more attention to profit margins than quality
journalism.
   He told an audience at the University of California, Riverside,
that some media groups used their publications as ``ever-faithful
cash cows for the owners.''
   ``C.K. represents everything that was good about journalism and
newspapering,'' said Gregory Favre, executive editor of The
Sacramento Bee.
   ``His values, his concerns, his integrity, his gentleness and
his toughness, his generosity, his intellect, his curiousity and
his caring created an environment which inspired all around him to
do their best,'' Favre said.
   Howard Weaver, managing editor of the Anchorage Daily News, said
that since McClatchy's purchase of the paper a decade ago, the
company provided it financial support ``to literally go from being
on its deathbed to being the state's leading newspaper.''
   McClatchy's company became embroiled in a legal dispute in 1984
with then-Sen. Paul Laxalt, a close friend of Ronald Reagan and
one-time Republican candidate for president, after The Sacramento
Bee and two other newspapers in the group published a story in 1983
on the Laxalt family's ownership of a hotel-casino in Nevada during
the 1970s. It said federal agents believed someone had illegally
skimmed profits from the casino to cut its tax liability.
   Laxalt filed a $250 million libel suit against the McClatchy
newspapers. When the suit was settled in 1987, the papers issued a
statement saying ``extensive discovery'' found no evidence of
skimming. Both sides claimed victory.
   McClatchy, born March 25, 1927, in Fresno, earned his
undergraduate degree at Stanford University in 1950.
   He served in the Army from 1951 to 1953, and reported for The
Washington Post from 1953 to 1955.
   The next two years, he was assistant press secretary to Adlai
Stevenson in the Democrat's second unsuccessful presidential
campaign against Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   In 1957, McClatchy returned to reporting, with ABC News in
Washington.
   He joined The Sacramento Bee in 1958, starting as a reporter and
working his way to associate editor in 1962.
   He was named editor of McClatchy Newspapers in 1974, elected
company president in 1978, replacing his aunt Eleanor McClatchy and
made chairman in 1988.
   In Feburary 1988, McClatchy Newspapers offered public stock for
the first time, but control remained under McClatchy and six other
family members and several family trusts.
   McClatchy was the great-grandson of James McClatchy, an Irish
immigrant who came to California in 1857, became a reporter on the
newly founded Sacramento Bee, and purchased the newspaper a short
time later.
   He passed the newspaper to son, C.K. McClatchy, who was editor
and chairman of the company for 53 years until his death in 1936.
   His daughter Eleanor was the next president.
   McClatchy also was a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board, the
Newspaper Advertising Bureau's board of directors, Washington
Journalism Center board of trustees and the American Press
Institute's board of directors executive committee.
   He is survived by two sons, Charles, 30, of Phoenix, Ariz.;
Kevin, 26, of Miami; daughter, Adair, 28, of San Francisco; two
brothers, James, 68, of Tiburon, and Ellery, 64, of Palm Beach,
Fla.; and his mother, Phebe of Fesno.
   He was divorced from his wife, Grace Kennan, whose father George
Kennan served as ambassador to the Soviet Union under President
Franklin Roosevelt and was the architect of the post-World War II
containment policy against Soviet expansionism.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

<HEAD>Government Says Troops Drive Rebels Off Salang Highway</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers dislodged Moslem guerrillas
blocking the highway that connects the Soviet border to Kabul, and
convoys of food and fuel are expected to reach the capital soon,
the government said Monday.
   Mohammad Nabi Amani, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, also
said the insurgents had new weapons and planned increased attacks
on Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul.
   A special security court in the capital convicted a 23-year-old
Palestinian of spying for the guerrillas trying to oust the
Soviet-sponsored government.
   Amani told reporters government troops overcame blockades the
insurgents had established at two points on the Salang Highway,
which runs north for 260 miles through the Hindu Kush mountain
range to the Soviet border.
   Although insurgents had virtually closed the highway, about 100
supply trucks broke through last week, becoming the first convoy to
arrive in Kabul since April 6. Amani said he expected 600 trucks
stranded on the road to arrive soon, but gave no details.
   About 65 trucks left Kabul for Jalalabad, which the rebels
besieged March 6 in their first major offensive after Soviet
military forces completed their withdrawal Feb. 15.
   He said reconnaissance flights showed the insurgents to be
planning a new offensive around the city, which is about 45 miles
from the Pakistan border, but did not elaborate.
   Amani said rockets and heavy artillery rounds hit Jalalabad,
wounding a civilian. He claimed 32 guerrillas, including five
commanders, were killed in a retaliatory strike by government
forces.
   Each side in the war exaggerates the other's casualties and the
conflicting estimates cannot be reconciled.
   Guerrilla spokesmen in Pakistan reported heavy fighting outside
Jalalabad after a weekend in which the insurgents claimed to have
have captured seven government outposts. They and Amani also
reported fighting at Khost, another eastern garrison town about 75
miles to the south.
   The Afghan News Agency of the seven-party guerrilla alliance
based in Pakistan quoted a commander named Fazli Haq Muhajid as
saying insurgents breached Jalalabad's southern defenses for the
first time in the offensive.
   In Kabul, the national security court convicted Abdul Razaq of
spying for the guerrillas. The three-judge panel said the young
Palestinian deserved the death penalty but was sentenced to 16
years in prison because he asked for mercy.
   Razaq was found guilty of illegally entering Afghanistan,
military spying, collaborating with insurgents and trying to
persuade soldiers to defect.
   He admitted entering Afghanistan illegally, but said his purpose
was to preach the Islamic faith.
   ``I am not a professional killer,'' he told the court. ``I came
to make peace between two (guerrilla) commanders. I am not a spy.
My objective was to remove tension between two disputing sides.''
   Soldiers who stormed a guerrilla hideout in northwestern
Afghanistan arrested Razaq in December, prosecutors said. Razaq
said his home was in a refugee camp in Jordan.
   On April 5, the court convicted two Pakistanis of spying. One
was sentenced to 16 years, the other to 18 years.
   Pakistan, the United States and China are major supporters of
the guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978. Soviet forces entered the war in December 1979 and withdrew
nine years later under a U.N.-mediated agreement.

   The nation's tobacco farmers are hoping to
boost production this year, and one of the reasons is the thriving
overseas demand for U.S. cigarettes and unrolled leaf.
   According to the Agriculture Department, almost one of every six
cigarettes made in the United States in 1988 went to foreign
buyers. More than two of every five pounds of tobacco leaf produced
by farmers last year were exported.
   Sustained increases in foreign demand have more than offset the
continued decline in U.S. cigarette use, meaning that the
department's annual quotas for flue-cured and burley tobacco have
been increased for the 1989 season.
   In response, tobacco farmers have indicated they intend to plant
713,000 acres this year, up 13 percent from 1988. With average
yields, this year's total tobacco harvest could increase by about
15 percent.
   The department's Economic Research Service says in its latest
analysis that U.S. cigarette production rose about 1 percent in
1988 to an estimated 695 billion ``pieces.'' Americans smoked 562.5
billion cigarettes last year, about 2 percent fewer than in 1987.
   But cigarette exports rose more than 18 percent last year to
118.5 billion pieces, while shipments of leaf rose 12 percent to an
equivalent of 578 million pounds farm sales weight _ about 17
percent of the 1988 tobacco output of 1.35 billion pounds.
   ``The United States is the world's leading tobacco exporter as
well as the largest importer,'' the report said.
   Back in the early 1960s, the United States exported about 30
percent of its tobacco. In recent years, exports accounted for 38
percent of the crop. However, there has been a rise in competition,
and the U.S. share of the world market has dropped by half _ from a
28 percent share in 1970 to 14 percent in 1987.
   Last year, the report said, the value of all U.S. tobacco
exports was a record $4.15 billion, up 22 percent from calendar
1987, the previous high. The total included $1.25 billion worth of
unmanufactured tobacco and $2.9 billion in products, mostly
cigarettes.
   According to the Census Bureau, some 105 countries bought U.S.
tobacco last year. About 60 percent of the cigarettes went to Asian
countries, while Europe traditionally is the largest buyer of leaf,
which is used to blend into domestically produced products.
   Despite the recent pickup in leaf exports, they continue to hold
below the annual levels during most of the 1970s and early 1980s.
Higher excise taxes are reducing or slowing the growth of cigarette
sales in some countries, the report said. And the high costs of
U.S. tobacco, together with the dollar's strength in the early
1980s, prompted some to shift to other sources, notably Brazil and
Zimbabwe.
   Even with comparatively lower U.S. prices since 1985, there is
still ``stiff competition from less expensive foreign stocks,'' the
report said.
   Last year, for the first time since 1980, West Germany was the
leading buyer of U.S. tobacco leaf, followed by Japan, which was
the No. 1 market the previous seven years. But that was mainly
because Japan reduced 1988 imports after buying unusually large
quantities the previous year.

   A toll-free consumer meat and poultry hotline
operated by the Agriculture Department generated about 50,000
telephone calls last year, most of them asking for information
about food safety.
   Linda Burkholder of the department's Food Safety and Inspection
Service, the agency that handles meat and poultry inspection
programs, reports that the number of calls during the fiscal year
that ended Sept. 30 increased 6 percent from 1987.
   Burkholder said about 30,000 of the calls came in during USDA's
regular business hours, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST. After hours and on
weekends, callers heard taped educational messages, such as tips on
safe food preparation, suggestions for transporting foods or
information on product recalls.
   ``Approximately 70 percent of callers asked about basic food
safety,'' she said in the spring issue of USDA's Food News
magazine. ``These questions concerned how long a specific meat or
poultry item could be safely stored, how to minimize the risk of
illness from eating raw or lightly cooked eggs or how to judge when
turkey is done.''
   About 5 percent of the calls were about salmonella, with most
wanting to know how the bacteria cause food poisoning, while others
were interested in federal programs designed to control salmonella.
   Repeat callers accounted for 12 percent of last year's calls,
Burkholder said. The number of the toll-free hotline, now in its
fourth year, is 1-800-535-4555.

   Bob Bergland, a former secretary of
agriculture and a major voice in support of the nation's rural
electric cooperatives, has offered a reminder about the role of the
Rural Electrification Administration.
   The REA, an agency of the Agriculture Department, was created in
the 1930s to finance electric power service to the nation's
farmers. Various administrations have sought to curb or alter its
functions.
   Bergland, speaking last week at a hearing of a House
Appropriations subcommittee, urged lawmakers to ``reject outright''
current proposals to privatize the agency.
   ``REA is a lending program, not a grant program,'' he said.
``Last year rural electrics (local cooperatives) borrowed $780
million from the government, but they paid back some $4 billion in
principal and interest.''
   Bergland, who was secretary during the Carter administration, is
executive vice president and general manager of the National Rural
Electric Cooperative Association, which represents about 1,000
local co-ops.
   ``Now is not the time to weaken any component of this delicate
infrastructure'' built as a ``proven partnership between the
federal REA and rural electric co-ops,'' he said.

<HEAD>Officials Unveil New, Progressive Tax Structure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union introduced a new, progressive
income tax that will abolish payments by the poor and increase
rates threefold for wealthier citizens.
   Finance Minister Boris I. Gostev said the new tax structure
reflects growing differences in income.
   In an interview published Monday in the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda, Gostev said the new tax structure becomes
effective in January and is the first change in 46 years.
   On Sunday, Pravda published the tax structure in the form of a
draft law. The draft must be approved by the government before it
becomes law.
   Soviets currently pay a flat 10 percent of their income in taxes
if they make less than the equivalent of $320 a month. The rate
increases a few percentage points for higher incomes.
   Under the draft, people making more than $2,400 a month will pay
50 percent of their earnings to the treasury.
   Gostev said only 3.4 percent of Soviet workers make more than
the equivalent of $800 a month, and that most Soviets won't be
affected by the new tax structure.
   The new structure calls for abolishing tax payments by people
who make less than $130 a month _ just above the amount government
officials consider the minimum necessary to get by in Soviet
society. It also provides for reduced taxes for earners of less
than $160 monthly, with officials determining later how big the
reduction should be.
   Most industrial workers make $347 a month.
   The structure sets a tax rate of 12.2 percent for incomes of
$1,120 a month increasing progressively to the 50 percent ceiling.
   Most taxes are withheld at the workplace, and workers do not
need to file annual tax returns.
   The finance minister said cooperatives, individuals who have
struck out on their own to produce goods and services and other
reforms fostered by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``have raised
the level of material security of Soviet citizens and at the same
time raised the differentiation of the population's income.''
   They need a new tax structure to reflect those changes, he said.
   Wage-earners with four or more dependents are eligible for a tax
cut of 30 percent of the new rates, according to the published
report.
   Soviet taxpayers who earn money from several difference sources
now must pay separately on each of the sources. Gostev said the new
law unifies all income sources so people pay on total income.
   It includes stiff penalties for tax evaders, he said.
   In October, several Soviet economists said an overhaul of the
tax structure was essential to distribute income more equitably and
expose those who have made fortunes on the black market.
   ``To search for some kind of scientific approach in our system
of taxation is useless,'' Deputy Finance Minister Viktor Semyonov
told the weekly Moscow News.
   Another economist, V. Yaroshenko, said a yearly report of income
and expenditures ``would serve as a means of strong economic and
psychological action most of all against the system of organized
crime.''

   The first Asian elephant born in captivity
in the Western Hemisphere in nearly half a century celebrated his
27th birthday with a peanut butter and whole wheat cake topped with
carrots.
   The birthday party for ``Packy'' brought nearly 6,000 people to
the Washington Park Zoo on Saturday to celebrate and sing ``Happy
Birthday'' to the 10-foot-tall, 6{-ton elephant.
   Y. Sherry Sheng, the zoo's director, said that Packy's birth
``was a big deal'' in 1962 because he was the first Asian elephant
conceived and born in captivity in the West in 44 years.
   ``It's part of family history,'' said Sheng, noting that some
people have kept ``baby'' scrapbooks of Packy's birthday
celebrations.
   Roger Henneous, senior elephant keeper, said Packy is the
gentlest of the three male elephants at the zoo, even ``pretty much
of a wimp,'' and he delights children who come to see him.
   Zoo officials say Packy could be around a long time, perhaps
living to be 60.

   Getting Mom and Dad a 41st anniversary
present took more than just pulling out a credit card for Scott and
Dennis Rice, who spent six months restoring a 15-year-old red
convertible to its former glory.
   ``When I was working ... that was always my ambition _ to ride
around in a convertible,'' said William Rice, who retired in 1982.
   Rice and his wife, Elinor, don't celebrate their anniversary
until April 23. But the sons decided to turn over the keys to the
1974 Buick ahead of time last month, when they were washing the car
in Dennis' driveway and their parents paid a surprise visit.
   ``We both said, `I can't believe it,''' Mrs. Rice said. ``I
said, `I've got to sit down. My knees are getting weak.'''
   Scott, 23, said he and his 35-year-old brother obtained the
Buick last fall. The restoration _ recorded on a six-hour videotape
_ had its share of setbacks. It took the entire six months to find
a new rear bumper, and a cat chose to walk across the trunk lid
when it was freshly painted.
   ``I had parts piled in my basement, all over the place, and
couldn't let `Grandpa' anywhere near the basement,'' said Dennis'
wife, Kathy, who contributed by sewing upholstery and doing hand
lettering.
   William Rice said he's changed his attitude about fancy cars now
that he has one.
   ``All they are to me is transportation,'' he recalled telling
his sons when they became interested in cars. ``But now I'm a
member of the club.''
   An engraved plaque attached to the Buick's dashboard says:
``Anniversary Edition 1948-1989. With All Our Love.''

   It's only a student body vote, but state
officials will be watching closely this week when Stanford
University holds the first election by computer in California.
   If voter turnout is as big as organizers hope, the election
Tuesday and Wednesday could be the largest in the United States
ever conducted on computers and a harbinger of general elections in
the 21st century.
   The Stanford computers will be programmed with a variety of
safeguards to discourage hackers and vote fraud. If the voter tries
something funny with the keyboard, for example, the computer will
make noise to summon a poll watcher.
   ``We're observing the Stanford election as an interesting
experiment,'' said John Mott-Smith, coordinator of voter outreach
programs for the California secretary of state's office.
``Computers are becoming increasingly useful in a variety of ways.
One of those ways could be elections.''
   An election last week at Boston University drew 3,159 voters,
believed to be the largest turnout at a computer election so far in
the United States. Stanford's enrollment of 13,000 is smaller than
BU's, but a typical Stanford election draws about 5,000 voters,
organizers said.
   ``It was very simple, a lot easier than the old system,'' said
BU senior Colin Dodd, who used a Macintosh ``mouse,'' a hand-held
device that transmits instructions to the computer, to make his
choices instead of a pen or pencil.
   Though though system at Boston got generally good reviews, a
disk failure caused 248 votes last week to go uncounted. A computer
scientist is checking to see whether the missing votes can be
retrieved, but they weren't enough to have affected the outcome of
any of the races there anyway.
   Although California has no plans to hold computerized elections,
officials are intrigued by Stanford's experiment and hope to see
how secure and ``user-friendly'' the system proves to be. The
election is expected to cost at least $3,000 less than the $13,000
spent last year, and allow votes to be counted within two hours
instead of five days.
   ``It's interesting for us to see how the bright minds of
Stanford University, in conjunction with Silicon Valley, are going
to deal with the questions of how voters interact with the
equipment,'' Mott-Smith said.
   omputers aren't completely unknown on Election Day, of course.
In many locations, voters use a stylus to punch holes in cards that
are then counted by computers, like the keypunch cards that were a
staple of computer departments until the last decade or so.
   But with that kind of voting system, or the old-fashioned paper
ballots, the paper remains as a backup if there is a problem or a
call for a recount.
   ``How a computer can duplicate that integrity is an interesting
question,'' Mott-Smith said. ``The bottom line is the people have
to have confidence that the system is accurate.''
   Stanford student election officials think they've got a
fraud-proof system that's easy to use and should take each voter
only about three minutes. The software was developed by a student,
sophomore Sandy Aronson.
   ``If the computer detects that it's being tampered with in some
manner, it will make a lot of loud noises and alert the poll
watcher,'' said elections commissioner Steven Krauss, also a
sophomore.
   But paper ballots will still be used by students at Stanford's
three overseas campuses, for absentee ballots and for those who
refuse to use the Macintosh computers.
   ``There will probably always be people on campus who don't know
how to use a `Mac' and are dreadfully afraid of using the
machine,'' Krauss said. ``For those who fall into that category _
who would like to vote but there's no way on God's green earth
they're going to touch one of these machines _ we will have paper
and pencils available.''

   Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, who for years
rejected Hollywood offers to do his story, says he signed with Home
Box Office because his contract allowed him to consult on the
script, draft by draft.
   Wiesenthal also said, in an interview for the April 22 TV Guide
magazine, that he was pleased by HBO's choice of Ben Kingsley to
play him in the movie to be broadcast Sunday, called ``Murderers
Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story.''
   The movie is based on Wiesenthal's 1967 book of the same title.
Wiesenthal, credited with finding more than 1,100 war criminals,
said producers were after him for years for the movie rights, but
offered deals that would have left him helpless if he felt the
script diverged from the truth.
   In 1984, executive producer Robert Cooper offered a contract
that gave Wiesenthal no veto power, but required that he be
consulted by the writers on each draft as they worked toward the
final script.
   ``Now I am confident that the spirit of my story will be
properly represented,'' Wiesenthal said.
   Kingsley, who won a best-actor Oscar for the title role in
``Ghandi,'' told the magazine he read three of Wiesenthal's books
before meeting him in Vienna, Austria.
   ``We clicked immediately,'' the British actor said, and
Wiesenthal had both of them crying within 10 minutes.
   ``He told me a story about liberation day on the 5th of May
(1945) and how some of his fellow Jews were dying as the GIs came
in,'' Kingsley said.

   The defense rested Monday without
presenting any witnesses in the murder trial of a Christian Science
couple accused of letting their 7-year-old diabetic daughter die
without medical attention.
   Former banker William Hermanson, 42, and his wife, Christine,
38, are charged with third-degree murder and felony child abuse.
   Sarasota Circuit Judge Stephen Dakan said he expected the six
jurors to begin deliberations Tuesday after closing arguments and
his instructions.
   Amy Hermanson was aided by spiritual healers but not doctors
before her death in September 1986. The Hermansons' attorneys
claimed the couple were acting legally under a 1975 Florida law
allowing parents to withhold medical treatment from their sick
children if they are ``legitimately practicing'' their religious
beliefs.
   Christian Science tenets rely on prayer and spiritual
practitioners rather than on medicine to heal illness. There are no
church sanctions, however, for followers who seek medical aid.
   The couple have a right to practice their religion ``but not the
right to allow a child to die,'' Assistant Sarasota State Attorney
Deno Economou said during the week-long trial.
   On Friday, defense attorneys successfully blocked the testimony
of a family friend who said out of the jury's presence that Amy's
parents had in the past obtained medical care for themselves but
didn't get the insulin injections that expert witnesses said could
have saved their child's life.
   Attorney Charles Arnold said the surprise testimony by Mary
Christman violated trial rules requiring lawyers to notify the
other side of damaging testimony expected to be introduced.
   The prosecutors acknowledged their inaction but gave no
explanation, and the judge ruled the testimony inadmissible.

<HEAD>As Costs Rise for Poor, Number of Available Homes Shrinks</HEAD>

   Despite increases in federal spending and the
number of families being helped, poor families face an ever-growing
shortage of low-rent homes and apartments, according to a private
study of government data released Monday.
   More of the poor were forced to pay more for housing because of
soaring costs from 1978 to 1985, said the study, entitled ``A Place
to Call Home.''
   The study was produced by two advocacy groups that generally
advocate increased resources for social programs, the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities and the Low Income Housing Information
Service. The authors used data from a 1985 housing survey.
   The various findings of the study are captured in one statistic:
   The proportion of poor renting families who pay at least 60
percent of their income for rent and utilities rose from 44 percent
in 1978 to 55 percent in 1985.
   Among poor owners, the proportion rose from 31 percent to 38
percent.
   Half of all poor renting households paid at least $266 a month
in 1985, up from the 1978 figure of $229.
   In the 1970s and 1980s, housing demand increased while supply
shrank, the study said.
   The number of households with cash incomes below the official
poverty line rose 25 percent from 10.5 million to 13.3 million from
1978 to 1985. That line was $8,573 for a family of three in 1985.
   HUD guidelines consider housing ``affordable'' if it takes no
more than 30 percent of family income.
   The number of houses and apartments available for a monthly rent
of $250 or less _ 30 percent of the income of a family making
$10,000 a year _ was 9.7 million in 1970, or 2.4 million more than
the comparable number of families.
   In 1978, there were still 370,000 more units than familes, but
by 1985 the number of families had risen to 11.6 million while the
number of houses and apartments available at $250 or less had
fallen to 7.9 million _ a deficit of 3.7 million affordable housing
units. Of the 7.9 million, 800,000 were vacant and 1.5 million were
occupied by families with incomes above the poverty line.
   The primary cause of the disappearance of low-cost housing,
according to Barry Zigas, executive secretary of the Low Income
Housing Information Service, was ``upgrading, abandonment and
changes in use,'' including gentrification in some cities, as well
as ``substantial cost escalation in housing.''
   ``Our housing resources are filtering up rather than down'' the
income scale, he said.

<HEAD>Highlights of President's Initiative of Incentives</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMTRAMCK, Mich (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are the major features of the
package President Bush unveiled Monday to reward Poland for its
recent steps toward democracy and to encourage further political
and economic reforms.
   _Trade concessions.
   The administration will submit to Congress legislation to lower
U.S. tariffs on a variety of Polish goods. This would be
accomplished by putting Poland under the Generalized System of
Preferences, which gives this form of trade relief to selected
countries with low per-capita incomes.
   The administration estimates the value to Poland at $3.5 million
to $25 million annually, depending on what products benefit from
tariff reductions and how aggressively Poland reacts to the lowered
tariffs.
   _Old loans.
   Bush called for other wealthy western nations to join the United
States in giving Poland easier terms for paying back its $38
billion foreign debt, only $2.4 billion of which is owed to the
United States. But the debt stretch-out would be conditioned on
economic reforms by the Warsaw government.
   Administration sources said the step could lead to the
rescheduling of up to $700 million in existing debt.
   _New loans.
   The administration said it would support conditional new loans
to Poland from the International Monetary Fund, but suggested they
should be tied to movement toward ``market-oriented economic
policies.'' The White House did not put a dollar value on the IMF
loans.
   Some official sources have suggested the IMF loans could total
$300 million if Poland meets all the requirements, followed perhaps
by $250 million more from the World Bank.
   _Business investment.
   The package provides a variety of incentives to encourage more
U.S. business investment in Poland, along with joint ventures with
Polish businesses. These overtures would be made conditional on
Poland's progress in carrying out the political and labor reforms
it has promised, including recognizing Solidarity and holding free
and open parlimentary elections.
   _Debt-equity swaps.
   The government proposed that Poland be permitted to reduce some
of its international debt by giving U.S. banks or other investors
shares in Polish enterprises in exchange.

<HEAD>Mitchell Raises Rhetoric In Minimum Wage Battle; Asks Labor To Confront
Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell on
Monday told a union conference ``the president is against us'' in
efforts to raise the minimum wage and urged the delegates to
confront President Bush when he speaks to them Tuesday.
   ``Maybe you can ask him this question,'' Mitchell told about
3,000 delegates of the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades
national conference. ``How is it that the president can propose a
tax cut of $30,000 a year for the very richest Americans and yet at
the same time say that 30 cents an hour for the poorest Americans
is too much? I say that is wrong and that is unfair.''
   Mitchell, D-Maine, was referring to Bush's proposal to cut
capital gains taxes and the 30 cents an hour difference between
Bush's offer to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25 by 1992 and
the $4.55 target contained in legislation passed by both the House
and Senate.
   The White House and congressional proposals also differ on
whether employers should be able to pay newly hired workers a
subminimum wage. Bush has said he will not sign any increase unless
there is a six-month ``training wage'' covering all new employees,
while both the House and Senate bills include a two-month training
period with significant eligibility restrictions.
   A conference committee is resolving differences between the
House and Senate bills before the measure can be given final
passage and be sent to Bush, who has promised to veto it.
   The president appears to have enough votes to sustain a veto,
but Democrats have decided on a vigorous campaign in favor of the
bill in hopes of gaining a political edge should Bush hold fast to
his veto threats.
   ``We're going to fight,'' Mitchell said. ``The president is
against us.''
   Mitchell delivered a lengthy defense of the Democratic Party and
questioned Bush's campaign call for a ``kinder, gentler'' nation.
   ``We've made mistakes,'' Mitchell said of the Democrats. ``We've
gone too far in some cases. But if this is a kind and gentle nation
it is Democrats who made it so, and if it is to become kinder and
gentler it is Democrats who will make it so.''
   Mitchell also said that ``with or without'' Bush the Democrats
planned to move forward with their domestic agenda, including
programs for the homeless, environment, health care and
infrastructure.
   ``We've got a public agenda that won't wait and we're not going
to wait,'' Mitchell said.

<HEAD>Poll Indicates Californians Support Tighter Border Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Californians overwhelmingly support tighter
border security and immigration restrictions to stem the flow of
illegal migration across the U.S.-Mexican border, according to a
poll released Monday.
   The poll of 800 California voters and another 272 San Diego-area
residents showed support for a four-mile drainage ditch the federal
government plans to build along the border to stop Mexican
motorists from driving into southern California illegally.
   ``Californians are strongly concerned about legal and illegal
immigration into that state,'' said Daniel Stein, executive
director of Federation for American Immigration Reform, which
commissioned the poll conducted April 6-9 by Tarrance &amp; Associates
of Houston.
   The telephone survey, showing increased concern about drug
smuggling across the border and continuing illegal immigration,
means that ``we may be looking at a political time bomb for elected
officials,'' he said.
   The poll showed that 69 percent of Californians statewide
supported limits on the number of legal immigrants each year.
   It also found that 60 percent supported the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's plan to build a four-mile drainage ditch
in a desert area of San Diego County to stop motorists from
speeding across unpatrolled border areas.
   The ditch was supported by 57 percent of the San Diego-area
residents, while 31 percent of this group said they opposed the
plan. Statewide, 28 percent were opposed.
   The San Diego sample had a margin of error of 5.9 percent.
   The poll was released two days before the San Diego City Council
debates a proposed resolution to oppose the ditch. A number of
Hispanic political groups have lined up against the proposal.
   But Stein says the poll shows Hispanic Californians support the
ditch by a 61-33 percent margin and that Hispanics generally
support tougher measures to stem illegal immigration.
   ``Hispanics, like all other Americans are concerned about
competition on the bottom of the job ladder,'' Stein said.
   But the poll also showed that Hispanics split 52-44 percent when
asked if they supported erection of secure fences and barriers to
thwart illegal border crossings.
   In January, FAIR issued an extensive study proposing
construction of sunken concrete walls and secure fences to tighten
border security. The organization's membership includes Colorado's
former Democratic governor, Richard Lamm, former Sen. Walter D.
Huddleston, D-Ky., and former Attorney General William French Smith.
   Of those surveyed in the San Diego area, 31 percent said they
opposed the ditch while 12 percent said they were unsure.
Statewide, 28 percent opposed construction of the ditch while 11
percent said they were unsure.
   The poll also found overwhelming support among Californians for
increased border security to curb drug smuggling. Sixty-eight
percent of those surveyed statewide said they strongly felt that
tighter security was needed to stop cross-border drug trafficking.
   Among the San Diego sample, the figure was 73 percent.
   The poll showed that 71 percent of California voters approved a
proposal to charge a $1 or $2 border crossing fee to finance more
U.S. Customs Service inspectors at the border.

   Borrowing a fund-raising gimmick from
Washington's wealthy socialites, the Soviet ambassador's wife held
an invitation-only fashion show at a swank downtown hotel Monday to
benefit children in earthquake-stricken Armenia.
   As an added attraction, Liana Dubinin recruited her 23-year-old
daughter, Irena, as a model. A group of Senate wives, swept up in
the spirit of glasnost, pitched in to serve tea, sandwiches and
pastries for about 100 high-society customers.
   It was the first time in memory that the Soviet Embassy had
sponsored a benefit fashion show, a fund-raising event
traditionally favored by the philanthropy-minded wives of wealthy
American capitalists.
   Mrs. Dubinin, the Armenian-born wife of Soviet ambassador Yuri
Dubinin, welcomed such Washington socialites as Buffy Cafritz and
Esther Coopersmith to the mezzanine of the Madison Hotel for the
opening of the three-day fashion show.
   Iranian-born designer Cleopatra Broumand of New York donated
Italian knits, scarves and original evening wear designs for the
event. The wholesale prices, about half of what the Cleopatra label
usually fetches, ranged from $150 for a knit ensemble to $3,000 for
an evening gown.
   Irena, a graduate student in political science, said she agreed
to model the clothes ``just for fun.''
   Born in Paris while her father was Soviet ambassador to France,
Irena is a graduate of the Institute of International Relations in
Moscow and is studying for a master's degree with emphasis on
recent U.S.-Spanish relations. During her college years, her father
was ambassador to Spain. A twin sister, Tatiana, lives in Moscow.
   Mrs. Dubinin, who came to Washington with her husband nearly
three years ago, has a particular concern for the plight of
Armenians who suffered in last December's devastating earthquake.
Her father, who now lives in Moscow, was an engineer in Armenia
when she was born, she said, and many of her relatives still live
there.
   Besides her Armenian father, she said, her mother was from
Soviet Georgia. ``My husband says that is a very dangerous
combination,'' she said with a laugh.
   The benefit committee supporting the fashion show included Susan
Eisenhower, former U.S. Protocol Chief Selwa Roosevelt and the
wives of foreign diplomats and of former Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci and Arthur Hartman, former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet
Union.

<HEAD>Bentsen Wants IRS to Notify Taxpayers Who Overpaid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, introduced legislation Monday that would require
the Internal Revenue Service to notify taxpayers when they overpay
their taxes.
   ``The IRS should be honest with taxpayers _ not try to hide from
them that they have paid more than they rightfully owe,'' Bentsen,
a Texas Democrat, said in a Senate speech. ``We expect taxpayers to
pay their fair share, but not an extra share.''
   The bill grew out of a disclosure last month that the IRS
instructed employees matching tax returns with income forms, such
as the W-2 for wages and the 1099 for interest and pension
payments, to keep quiet when such examination disclosed
overpayment. The overpayment usually resulted when a taxpayer
failed to subtract taxes withheld from taxes owed.
   After an IRS employee in Memphis complained to Sen. Albert Gore
Jr., D-Tenn., IRS Acting Commissioner Michael J. Murphy ordered the
policy discontinued.
   Bentsen's bill would write that change into law.

   Jim Wright's attorney predicted Monday the
House ethics committee will find no rules violations when it
considers whether ``clear and convincing'' evidence exists of
improper conduct by the speaker.
   Lawyer William C. Oldaker, rebutting all the charges in the
committee's statement of alleged violations, said they were based
on ``a mischaracterization of facts...outrageous readings of
legislative history ... retroactive writing of the rules
...doublespeak.''
   Oldaker commented after committee chairman Julian C. Dixon,
D-Calif., announced the panel was charging the Texas Democrat with
69 violations of House rules.
   In a lengthy statement, the panel found ``reason to believe''
Wright had broken rules requiring reporting of gifts, barring
acceptance of gifts from persons with a direct interest in
legislation and limiting outside earned income.
   Both Oldaker and Dixon emphasized the committee's allegations
were based only on a ``reason to believe'' that rules were
violated. In order for the panel to declare actual violations took
place and to recommend punishment by the full House, it must find
``clear and convincing evidence,''
   ``I am confident they will find no rules violations clearly and
convincingly proved,'' said Oldaker, who particularly criticized
the committee's special outside counsel, Richard J. Phelan of
Chicago, for its report Monday.
   The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, the panel's
formal name, charged that Wright's friend and business partner,
Fort Worth, Texas, real estate developer and investor George
Mallick, improperly provided $145,000 worth of gifts over a 10-year
period.
   The committee found that Mallick had a direct interest in
legislation before Congress, making it a violation of House rules
for Wright to accept more than $100 in gifts in a calendar year.
   Oldaker called the allegation that Mallick had a direct interest
in legislation ``one of the most outrageous readings of legislative
history.''
   He called Mallick ``a close personal friend'' of Wright who had
``interest in oil and an interest in real estate. That covers
everyone in the country.''
   The attorney said Mallick ``never asked the speaker to do
anything for himself or anyone else.''
   The committee charged Wright with failing to report the benefits
he received from Mallick as gifts on his annual financial
disclosure forms.
   The items deemed ``gifts'' by the ethics committee included free
housing from 1979 through 1984 in Fort Worth, valued at $31,698;
cut-rate housing from 1985 through 1988, valued at $21,790; an
$18,000-a-year salary paid to Wright's wife, Betty, from 1981
through 1984, totaling $72,000, and the use and maintenance of a
1979 Cadillac from 1983 through 1988, valued at $19,391.
   According to Oldaker, it was Mallick's practice ``to have
employees live for free'' in the same Fort Worth condominium
complex he let the Wright's use.
   Oldaker said Phelan wrongly implied that Wright's wife, Betty,
was incompetent when she worked for the investment company founded
by Wright, Mallick and their wives.
   Wright's lawyer said former colleagues of Mrs. Wright told the
committee she worked five to seven days a month, when she ``went
out and looked at various investments and talked to people.'' He
said Mrs. Wright was not successful in the ventures and left no
written record of her work.
   The car was owned by the Wright-Mallick firm, and ``the speaker
never believed the car was a gift,'' Oldaker said.
   Wright was accused by the committee of having ``an overall
scheme'' to evade House limits on outside earned income by, in
seven instances, selling bulk quantities of his book ``Reflections
of a Public Man'' to groups to which he had delivered speeches.
   The panel said that action, in effect, converted money that
should have been speaking fees _ limited under House rules _ into
book royalties, which are not under the limits. In an eighth
instance, the panel said, Wright received an undisclosed gift
because books paid for by a private individual were not delivered.
   Oldaker said the committee found problems with only seven
speeches during a three-year period when Wright gave 750 talks.
   On the disclosure question, Oldaker said, ``Public disclosure
was made, which is the essence of everything. Betty Wright's salary
was disclosed. The book royalties were disclosed. There was a lot
of noise, a lot of clamoring, but very little substance.''

<TEXT>
   The cost of loving is going up.
   New York, after years of allowing manufacturers free use of the
``I Love New York'' logo, will start charging royalties this year.
   People who print the logo on sweatshirts, key chains, pens or
other consumer goods will be forced to give New York state 6
percent to 10 percent of the money they make, said Stephen Morello,
a state deputy commissioner for economic development.
   The state has spent more than $100 million advertising itself to
tourists since launching the ``I Love New York'' advertising
campaign in 1977, he said.
   The state registered the motto with a red heart symbol in place
of the word ``love.'' Though the symbol has been adapted for a
variety of bumper stickers and other uses, the state only holds the
trademark for loving New York.
   ``We think this is one modest way to begin recapturing some of
the investment without negatively impacting the motto's
effectiveness,'' Morello said.
   State officials have watched with great interest the success of
the California raisins advertising campaign, which has branched off
into lucrative records, touring cartoon characters and other
products, he said.
   A licensing agent will be hired to help market the logo, which
tourism officials refer to in news releases as ``legendary.''
   Up until now, the state has allowed manufacturers to include ``I
Love New York'' in anything deemed appropriate, figuring it's
helping the state advertise itself, he said.
   Manufacturers who already use the logo will be allowed a certain
period of time to sell off their inventory before they have to
start paying, he said.

<TEXT>
   Poles reacted with delight Monday to news
that Solidarity was legal again, but some seemed doubtful that even
the legalization of the independent union can solve the country's
economic woes.
   Many Poles had not heard by afternoon that the Warsaw Regional
Court had approved registration of the union that had energized the
nation before being banned in the wake of the December 1981
martial-law crackdown.
   ``I didn't know. It's great. It should have happened a long time
ago,'' said Gregorz Maracewicz, a Solidarity supporter who works in
the science office of the Roza Luksemburg light-bulb factory.
   ``We will have to see what they (Solidarity) will do, but it
will make a great difference for all of us,'' he said before
heading home in a driving spring snowstorm after his shift.
   ``It's a good thing. It should change things, but it's hard to
say whether Solidarity can do it all by itself,'' said a factory
employee and former Solidarity member who declined to give her name.
   At the Institute for Professional Training, near where the
Warsaw branch of Solidarity had its offices during its first 16
months of legality, employees welcomed the decision.
   ``I am very happy. I really think it's a historic moment. I
think registration was the first condition of all the changes which
are going to improve things when there is more democracy,'' said
sociologist Krystyna Lewinska.
   ``I don't give interviews,'' said another institute employee who
walked away and smiled. He then turned his head and added, ``But I
am very happy.''
   Most of those interviewed who were members of the union during
its legal phase in 1980-81 said they would join again.
   ``That's obvious,'' said Alina Jablonska, an employee in a
design office now on maternity leave, when asked if she would
become a member again.
   ``We are full of hope. The whole society, at least my community,
believes our life problems should disappear, perhaps not so soon,
but in the long term,'' she said.
   An elderly woman, who like Jablonska was standing in line for
meat at the Hala Mirowska market, disagreed.
   ``It doesn't matter who rules. What matters is that things
should be good in this country so that I shouldn't have to stand in
line for a piece of meat,'' said the woman, a retired factory
worker who was a member of Solidarity in 1980-81.
   ``I don't think anything will change,'' she added, declining to
give her name.
   Authorities and the opposition hope the legalization of
Solidarity will provide social calm needed for economic reforms to
take effect.
   Chronic consumer shortages and the failure of wages to keep pace
with inflation sparked two crippling waves of strikes in May and
August 1988. Service on Poland's $38 billion debt eats up hard
currency needed for investments to modernize industry.
   In light of such problems, some Poles want to wait and see what
the union can do before joining. The union once boasted 10 million
members out of the 18 million-member workforce, but Walesa has said
he expects 5 million to 7 million in the new Solidarity.
   Others demonstrated their commitment to Solidarity even before
the decision to register the union was officially announced.
   ``We organized when Solidarity was illegal, underground, so we
are not used to this new situation. We represent committees already
organized in our region. The big difference will be our freedom of
action,'' said Roman Jarosz.
   The 26-year-old construction worker and three of his friends
took the overnight train from their home in Gorzow Wielkopolski in
western Poland so they could hold up a Solidarity banner in the
courtroom where the decision was read.

   Full-page newspaper advertisements formally

January that Darkie would have to go and its distinctive box be
redesigned.
   For more than 60 years, the Darkie trademark was a grinning,
top-hatted minstrel in blackface. Also on the box is its name in
Chinese, which literally means ``black man toothpaste.''
   Colgate-Palmolive said it would phase in the new name on
packaging and advertising this year and use a racially ambiguous
face under the top hat. However, Monday's advertisement in The
Straits Times carried the same grinning blackface logo. No
explanation was immediately available.
   The toothpaste, manufactured by Hawley and Hazel Chemical Co.
(Hong Kong) Ltd., got its trademark after a company executive
visited the United States and saw the late Al Jolson. The white
entertainer gained fame as a singer in blackface, and the company
decided his wide smile and bright white teeth would be ideal to
promote their product.
   A company spokeswoman said Darkie held 75 percent of the
toothpaste market in Taiwan, 50 percent in Singapore, 30 percent in
Malaysia and Hong Kong and 20 percent in Thailand. It was never
distributed outside Asia.
   Darkie started setting some teeth on edge after the U.S.
conglomerate Colgate-Palmolive paid $50 million for a 50 percent
stake in 1985.
   What was show biz in the 1920s is offensive racial imagery
today, and members of the Interfaith Center for Corporate
Responsibility started prodding for change. More than 240 church
groups belong to the New York-based non-profit center.
   After a three-day visit to Taiwan in December, six U.S.
congressmen also accused the company of perpetuating racial
stereotypes. In a statement initiated by Rep. John Conyers Jr.,
D-Mich., they said Darkie was one of many examples of racism in
consumer products in Asia.
   Hawley and Hazel tried to satisfy the critics and sustain the
brand's appeal among Asians by test-marketing the several names,
including Dakkie, pronounced ``ducky.''
   Test sales in Singapore produced no clear preference or aversion
to Darkie or Dakkie, said the company spokeswoman, who by custom is
not named. The Darkie name and logo were not seen as offensive, she
said.
   Nevertheless, Colgate-Palmolive chairman Reuben Mark said in
January, ``The morally right thing dictated that we must change.
What we have to do is find a way to change that is least damaging
to the economic interests of our partners.''

<HEAD>U.S. African Aid Policy Under Fire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials defended their
1990 African aid budget proposal Monday against a Democratic
senator's accusations of neglect and misplaced priorities.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., told his Foreign Operations
subcommmittee that despite millions of dollars in American aid,
countries south of the Sahara are ``facing every imaginable
problem'' today, with less economic assistance provided for the
half billion people who live in the region than for nine million
people in two Central American countries, El Salvador and
Honduras.''
   The senator demanded that the Bush administration halt what he
called a Republican ``policy of neglect'' that he said was
demonstrated by former President Ronald Reagan's never once
visiting Africa.
   ``To put it bluntly,'' Leahy said, ``your 1990 budget is wholly
inadequate to meet the challenges. ... I want us to do more.''
   Alison Rosenberg, deputy assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, acknowledged that recent appropriations for Africa
``have fallen short of allowing us to meet our earlier stated
objectives.''
   The 1990 request for $820 million in economic and $85 million in
military assistance for sub-Saharan Africa, a 10 percent increase
over 1989, has the correct emphasis, she said, with 10 times as
much economic as military assistance.
   Ms. Rosenberg said the military aid is focussed on countries
with important U.S. strategic interests _ Kenya, Chad and Zaire _
and is a fraction of the 1958 level of 158 million. Some $6 million
is requested for a recently launched program for civic action and
coastal security aid, she said, which has ``gained us direct access
to top leadership in half a dozen countries in West Africa.''
   Overall, she said, ``the decline in military assistance for
African countries has put U.S. reliability and credibility in
jeopardy. This year, we are unable to provide sufficient funding
even to support Niger's two C-130'' transport planes.
   On the economic side, Ms. Rosenberg described as ``a major
American success'' the trend toward private enterprise and
relaxation of state control over African economies.

<HEAD>Spy Agency to Build Computer Chip Plant to Make Sure of Secure Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Security Agency's decision to
build its own top secret computer-chip plant was spurred by the
threat of sensitive technology falling ``into the wrong hands,''
according to American electronics specialists.
   The NSA, the nation's biggest intelligence agency, says the $85
million microelectronics plant being built at Fort Meade, Md.,
represents a ``unique capability within the U.S. government.''
   The move comes amid increasing concern about erosion of American
chip-making expertise and manufacturing capacity in the face of
stiff competition from Japan, South Korea and other countries.
   The National Security Agency's main missions are eavesdropping
on communications around the globe, encoding U.S. communications
and cracking foreign codes, as well as safeguarding the security of
U.S. military computers and communications systems.
   To carry out those missions, the Defense Department agency makes
heavy use of sophisticated, powerful computers. Author James
Bamford, an authority on the agency has reported that computers
cover more than 5{ acres at its headquarters complex at Fort Meade.
   According to Bamford, the NSA has a work force topping 60,000
employees _ more than all other U.S. spy agencies combined _ and a
budget estimated at more than $10 billion a year.
   The NSA's public affairs office said that in September 1988 the
agency signed an $85 million contract with National Semiconductor
Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., ``to instrument and train the
government to operate a state-of-the-art microelectronics
fabrication facility.''
   Construction of 60,000 square feet of building space to house
the chip-making plant was started in January 1986 by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers and completed in October 1988, it said.
   ``Now National Semiconductor is outfitting the six-inch silicon
wafer fabrication line,'' the NSA statement said. ``Operations are
scheduled to begin in 1991, and National Semiconductor will train
NSA personnel in the operation of the new facility over a period of
18 months.''
   The agency said that ``building such a facility at Fort Meade
will enable NSA to have direct control over the production process
and the security procedures necessary for safeguarding the plant.
This facility represents a unique capability within the U.S.
government.''
   Paul Hazan, a computer scientist at the Johns Hopkins University
Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., said the NSA plant was
aimed at dealing with the threat of ``reverse engineering'' _
efforts to figure out the functioning of a computer system by
scrutinizing its key components.
   ``That is why they don't want to have a process made elsewhere.
... You have coding and so on, and if that falls into the wrong
hands, the other side could find out what your code is. That's why
they want to keep control of it in-house,'' he said.
   Hazan, chairman of the Defense Research and Development
Committee of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,
a 300,000-member professional association, said that ``we are
losing the commercial semiconductor competition.''
   ``Since that, in turn, is what is driving the technology, we
rapidly find ourselves where in defense, if you want to build
defense systems, you won't have the capability here. You have to go
overseas and hope that Japan or Korea or somebody else is willing
to apply the resources to that, as opposed to something else,'' he
said.
   Hazan added that ``if you do that, then it's a (commercial)
market _ presumably they'll sell it to anybody who has the need. So
it's potentially a very tricky situation.''
   Larry Sumney, president of Semiconductor Research Corp., an
electronics company in Research Triangle Park, N.C., said that in
1982, while he was on the Pentagon staff, he chaired a Defense
Science Board task force on development of very high-speed
integrated circuits.
   The task force recommended to the science board that the
government ``give some consideration to putting together a facility
to provide state-of-the-art integrated circuits for classified
applications,'' he said.
   Sumney noted that another Defense Science Board task force study
in 1987 also ``called attention to the fact that the government
couldn't put itself in a position of being dependent on foreign
sources.''
   Asked about the NSA's decision to build its own chip plant,
Sumney said, ``I would think that now it's even more supportable,
because we've continued to erode in our ability to be competitive
in world markets for integrated circuits.''

   Two men were charged Monday in the June
robbery and slaying of a sociologist who served as an adviser to
the Solidarity trade union, according to the state-run news agency.
   Marek Tomasz Marzec, 19, was charged with murder, and Krzysztof
Chrobocinski, 25, was charged with robbery and assault, the PAP
news agency said. No trial date was set.
   Jan Strzelecki, 69, died nearly three weeks after he was found
lying unconscious near the Vistula River in Warsaw. He had been
dragged from his car, robbed and thrown down an embankment, police
said at the time.
   Strzelecki was not a prominent member of Solidarity, but he was
an active supporter of the union. He was an associate professor at
the Polish Academy of Sciences.

   Rioters burned cars and smashed
shop windows after opposition leaders met to discuss alleged
government fraud in the March presidential elections, state-run
radio said.
   Police used tear gas to break up the disturbances Sunday in
which 13 people were injured and 20 arrested, the radio said. It
did not say how many people participated or where the riots began.
   Leaders of the three opposition parties met to challenge the
March 12 vote in which Presdient Didier Ratsiraka was elected to a
third term. He won the election with 62 percent of the vote and is
to be sworn in Thursday.
   The opposition said the voting was rigged and challenged the
outcome in a petition to the island nation's Supreme Court.
Opposition leaders asked that the election be overturned and a
provisional government be set up pending new voting.
   Ratsirka, 52, who was chosen president by the ruling military in
1975, won his first term with more than 98 percent of the vote. In
1982, he received 80 percent of the vote against a single opponent.
   In this year's election, the central issue was the economic
decline of the island off southeastern Africa.
   When he took office, Ratsirka broke many ties with France, the
former ruling colonial power, and with other Western nations. He
nationalized foreign-owned industries and set the nation on a
socialist course. But natural disasters ranging from cyclones to
droughts beset the island and with the economy near bankruptcy in
1982, Ratsirka began restoring economic ties with the West.

   Winemakers from California announced on Monday
the formation of a ``National Wine Coalition'' to make clear their
opposition to alcoholism.
   ``With the plethora of warning labels, signs and unsubtantiated
claims by an assortment of reform-minded organizations, the
consumer has a right to know the values and pleasures of wine when
used intelligently and in moderation,'' said John De Luca,
president of the Wine Institute, a trade association.
   Allied industries, such as restaurants and hotels are invited to
join the new organization, as well as groups opposed to the abuse
of alcohol.
   He was asked if it would cooperate with other countries that
produce wine.
   ``We don't intend to be negative about anyone,'' he replied. He
made it clear that would include manufacturers of spirits.
   A statement issued by the group said the new coalition would
promote programs linking wine with food and encouraging its use on
social occasions, would inform the media on positive aspects of
wine and set up a network of consumers ``who embrace the principles
of moderate consumoption.''
   It may also do some lobbying in Washington, the statement added.

   A private Roman Catholic college
wrongfully dismissed a nursing student when it forced her to leave
the college because she could not lose weight, a federal jury ruled
Monday.
   The jury ordered Salve Regina College in Newport to pay Sharon
Russell $30,000 for her tuition and wages she was deprived of while
she completed her nursing degree at a school in Hartford, Conn.
   Russell, 24, now a nurse in St. Petersburg, Fla., maintained she
was coerced into signing a contract with the college in her junior
year stating that she would lose two pounds a week.
   The school would not allow her to return in the fall of 1985 and
complete her senior year.

<HEAD>Egyptian Official Says About 1,000 Extremists Detained in Sweep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's top law enforcer said in
remarks distributed Monday that about 1,000 Moslem extremists were
detained this month in a nationwide sweep prompted by a riot
outside a provincial mosque.
   Security sources said earlier that only about 100 people were
rounded up.
   Interior Minister Zaki Badr, whose ministry oversees domestic
order, gave the new figure Sunday night during a speech at Cairo's
National Sporting Club. The state-run Middle East News Agency
distributed a summary of his remarks on Monday.
   The fundamentalist rioting, which left four people wounded,
broke out April 7 in the southern city of Fayoum immediately after
Friday prayers at a mosque. The government has accused, Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, a charismatic blind preacher, of inciting his
followers to violence.
   He was arrested on the day of the riots.
   The government contends that Abdel-Rahman is spiritual leader of
an underground extremist group called Jihad. It blames the group
for the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat and a later
coup attempt.
   Abdel-Rahman was tried twice after Sadat's slaying for
involvement with Jihad but was acquitted both times.
   Although Badr said about 1,000 extremists were detained in the
sweep since the riots, he did not say how many remained in custody
and on what charges.
   The emergency law that allows the detentions also lets
authorities hold people for virtually as long as they like without
charge.
   Badr, a practicing Moslem, said he would continue to crack down
on Moslem extremists ``with the utmost firmness.''
   Fayoum rioters demanded that the government impose Islam's legal
and social code known as Sharia. The rules include harsh criminal
penalties, like limb amputation and flogging.
   The government says most Egyptian laws already conform to
Sharia, but they do not include the code's corporal punishments.

   President Saddam Hussein handed out medals
Monday and promised cars to all soldiers who helped recapture the
Faw peninsula from Iran one year ago during a turning point of the
eight-year war.
   In the anniversary ceremony carried by state-run television,
Hussein said even soldiers who were given cars last year after the
36-hour battle would receive another auto.
   He did not say how many vehicles or what make were involved.
   Several thousand troops, led by the elite Presidential Guard,
took part in the fighting on the southern peninsula.
   Hussein also declared the anniversary a national holiday, and
the Iraqi media hailed the day. The English-language Baghdad
Observer daily called the recapture of Faw from forces of Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini a landmark in Arab history.
   ``It was the sweet nectar which turned to bitter poison for
Khomeini,'' it said.
   Khomeini had compared his acceptance of a U.N.-brokered
cease-fire with Iraq in August to drinking poison.
   The Iranians captured Faw in February 1986 and held it for two
years despite Iraqi efforts to dislodge their forces from
marshlands around the battered oil terminal town of Faw.
   In April 1988, the Iraqis launched a surprise attack and retook
the peninsula.

   The nation's 125,000 dockworkers went on
strike for higher wages Monday and the military stepped in to keep
ports functioning, news reports said.
   Year-long negotiations with the government over a pay raise
reached a stalemate Sunday.
   Navy personnel unloaded oil tankers and other vessels at the
nation's 11 ports, a Shipping Ministry spokesman said. The army
sent engineers to Bombay port, the nation's largest, to run control
rooms and berth ships, the United News of India reported.
   The strike also cut imports to Nepal, said M. Kar Gupta,
chairman of the Calcutta Port. India earlier this month suspended
trade with Nepal in a treaty dispute and the land-locked Himalayan
kingdom has depended on supplies from other countries routed
through Calcutta Port.
   Workers were striking for a 25 percent pay increase, scaled down
from an initial 66 percent increase demanded a year ago, the news
agency said. The government has offered dock workers a 15 percent
raise.
   An Indian longshoreman earns between $90 and $180 per month.

<HEAD>Don't Expect Immediate Results, Brady Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of President Bush's new plan for
encouraging commerical banks to voluntarily reduce Third World debt
told Congress on Monday not to expect immediate results.
   Despite a $3.6 billion package put together last week by the
International Monetary Fund to support economic reform in Mexico,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said it is too optimistic to
assume that commercial banks will immediately agree on how much to
cut Mexico's debt to them.
   Mexican Finance Minister Pedro Aspe was scheduled to begin
negotiations this week with a consortium of 13 U.S. commercial
banks holding a large portion of Mexico's $100 billion debt.
   Brady told members of the House Approporations Committee that
the $1.3 billion first-year portion of the IMF package would depend
on Mexico negotiating debt reductions from the commercial banks.
However, he said he expects negotiations to be ``lengthy'' before
any agreement is announced.
   ``To be dead honest with you, I think you ought to be prepared
to wait longer,'' he said. ``Let's not try to make the first of
these transactions so big that it scares everybody to death. We
don't have to throttle the train up to a 100 miles per hour when
we're first getting started.''
   But Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., said there is a ``short time
span'' for the commercial banks to step forward.
   The Treasury secretary said he was ``disappointed'' that the IMF
package announced last week did not include provisions for
so-called debt-equity swaps.
   In those deals, a bank will forgive a portion of the principle
or interest on a loan in exchange for an investment share in newly
privatized enterprises that formerly were operated by the debtor
country's government.
   Without naming them, Brady said he knew of two countries
negotiating deals to write down by 20 percent loans for electric
power stations that would be converted from public to private
ownership.
   The parties involved, he said, believe that amount of money will
be returned to the countries in the form of native capital that had
earlier fled it.
   Brady attempted to dispel fears that taxpayers will end up
bailing out banks with Third World loans through arrangement by
government-funded multilateral lending agencies like the IMF and
World Bank to guarantee that commercial banks that reduce the loans
will be paid the remaining balance.
   ``I don't think anybody's going to be involved in putting more
money into it than we're already putting into it,'' he said.
   But because countries can leverage money from the IMF and World
Bank and the loans held by commerical banks are being sold for only
25 to 60 percent of their face value, he said, the plan would allow
countries to buy back a face value amount equal to 10 times the
seed money, he said.
   ``You can get a $10 reduction for every dollar you spend on the
process,'' Brady said. In addition, he said, $9 in procurement
``comes back our way'' for every dollar of U.S. taxpayer funds
funneled to debtor countries through the IMF and World Bank.

   House Speaker Jim Wright chose a friendly
audience Monday to deny violating House rules in his financial
dealings and to call for a swift resolution so Congress could tend
to its business.
   ``I know in my heart I have not violated any rules of that
institution,'' Wright told 3,000 delegates to an AFL-CIO Building
and Construction Trades Department conference. ``I love that
institution.''
   Those comments were similar to the denial he issued last week in
advance of the House ethics committee's report alleging 69
violations of House rules.
   But unlike last week, Wright did not give a detailed answer to
each of the charges against him. Instead he delivered a lengthy
defense of Democratic Party ideals and his career and asked that
the committee allow him to come before it to counter the charges
immediately, ``surely within a week.''
   ``We cannot delay and be bogged down in acrimony,'' Wright said.
``Life is too short for that. Our problems are too big for that.''
   The Texas Democrat said he was ``prepared to live up to'' the
ultimate outcome of the investigation and then said, ``As long as I
live I'm going to be working for the kind of country that doesn't
accept second best as good enough.''
   It appeared that he had ended his brief discussion of the ethics
charges and was moving on to other topics when he suddenly added:
``Sometimes assertive and bold leadership draws the ire of powerful
forces in this country.''
   At the outset of the speech it was not clear whether Wright
would address the charges at all.
   He entered to a standing ovation that lasted several minutes and
a warm introduction from Robert A. Georgine, president of the
Building and Construction Trades Department, who saluted Wright as
``a man of honor and a man of integrity.''
   ``He's now under bombardment by the same right-wing element that
for years has bombarded us,'' Georgine said. On a huge screeen
behind Georgine was the picture of Wright used on the cover of a
book that figures prominently in the allegations of ethics
violations.
   Wright opened his speech with a few jokes, flashing his wide
grin and saying the lengthy applause had ``almost embarrassed me,
but not quite.''
   There were more jokes about the welcoming.
   ``There are two kinds of people in this world who appreciate
flattery _ men and women.''
   Then came stories about how building trades unions had helped
him in his 18 elections to Congress.
   ``I feel at home here,'' Wright said to more applause.
   He listed Democratic programs from the Great Depression to the
last session of Congress, and promised more in the year to come.
   And, before turning to the subject that had brought a dozen
television cameras to the basement ballroom of a Washington hotel,
Wright talked a bit about himself.
   ``I am 66 years of age,'' he told the hushe audience. ``I have
had the great privilege ... of serving more than half my life in
the Congress of the United States. Thanks to the friendship and the
confidence of my colleagues I was elected speaker of the House. I
think it is the greatest honor that can come to any lawmaker.''

<TEXT>
   A top Soviet psychiatric expert said Monday that
authorities in the past had abused the legal rights of mental
patients in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union pulled out of the World Psychiatric Association
in 1983 after reports that political dissidents were held in Soviet
psychiatric hospitals. The reports probably would have caused the
Soviets to be expelled from the association.
   The organization's executive committee voted at a meeting in
Madrid, Spain, on March 29 to re-admit the Soviets, a decision yet
to be ratified by the association's general assembly.
   ``Abuses have been committed in our psychiatry during the recent
decades,'' the official Tass news agency quoted Alexander Karpov,
the chief psychiatric expert in the Ministry of Public Health, as
saying. ``The way psychiatric patients were treated was not always
correct.''
   Karpov spoke at the opening of a three-day symposium on the law
and mental health attended by psychiatrists and lawyers from a
dozen countries.
   Karpov, without mentioning the treatment of dissidents, said
denying legal rights to psychiatric patients must be eliminated.
   ``This is why a decree was issued in the U.S.S.R. last year,
laying down new rules of psychiatric treatment,'' Tass quoted him
as saying.
   ``It gives the patients definite legal guarantees, showing that
they are no longer rightless in the eyes of public health organs,''
Karpov said. ``They now have the right to call in a lawyer, to
complain to the prosecutor or the court of justice.''
   The symposium is being attended by psychiatrists and lawyers
specializing in psychiatric cases from the United States, Canada,
the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, West Germany, East Germany,
Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Cuba, Tass said.
   In early March, a team of U.S. psychiatrists and lawyers were
allowed to interview 27 patients in an unprecedented two-week tour
of Soviet mental hospitals.
   After the tour, a group spokesman praised the Soviet Union for
its openness but said it was still impossible to tell whether
patients were being held for their political views, an abuse of
psychiatry the Soviets have pledged to end.

<TEXT>
   Wildlife officials on Monday staked
out a red oak tree by a reservoir where the first pair of bald
eagles to nest in Massachusetts in nearly 80 years is believed to
be guarding a clutch of eggs.
   ``The evidence is still purely circumstantial, but the female
refused to leave the nest when approached and the male has been
bringing her food,'' said Ellie Horwitz, a spokeswoman for the
state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.
   The male is Ross, one of the first pairs of eagles raised and
released in the restoration program begun in 1982. His mate is
another state-raised bird released in 1985, Ms. Horwitz said.
   Over the last seven summers the state has raised and released 42
bald eagles at the Quabbin Reservoir in western Massachusetts.
   Two other bald eagle pairs built nests at the reservoir this
spring, and there is a possibility that a second pair could also
have eggs, Ms. Horwitz said. The third pair are believed to be
younger birds practicing housekeeping as Ross and his mate did last
spring, she said.
   The last active bald eagle nest in Massachusetts was reported in
Sandwich, on Cape Cod, in 1910, she said.
   At least four other states _ New York, Pennsylvania, New
Hampshire and New Jersey _ also have active nests this spring,
state officials said.
   ``The bald eagle looks to be one of our success stories,'' said
Paul Nickerson of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``The
breeding population is increasing from 5 percent to 10 percent
annually.''
   He estimated the 48 lower states have about 2,200 breeding pairs
of bald eagles, up from 500 to 600 pairs in the 1960s.
   Nickerson credited the banning of DDT and other pesticides,
which weaken eagle egg shells, and a drop in shooting and trapping.
   It may take several years for eagles, which mate for life, and
return to the same nests year after year, to learn how to become
successful parents, Ms. Horwitz said. Normally they lay from one to
three eggs and the young hatch in mid-May, she said.

<HEAD>U.S. Stepping Up Efforts to Spot Private Coverage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is planning to increase its
efforts to assure that the Medicare program does not pay medical
bills for which private insurance carriers are liable.
   The secretary of health and human services, Louis Sullivan,
asked Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman in a
letter Friday to release $7.5 million to begin the stepped-up
enforcement plan.
   The HHS contingency funds would be used to make revisions in the
contracts with Medicare claims processors to require them to match
their private insurance records with their Medicare rolls, Sullivan
said. This would enable them to identify claims where private
policies are liable for the bill.
   The coverage issue stems from an overlap between Medicare and
private health plans for elderly people who continue to work.
   Under the law, Medicare is liable only for charges not covered
by the elderly employee's private health plan.
   Current efforts by the Health Care Financing Administration
results in annual Medicare savings of more than $1.8 billion, but
``HCFA has known for some time that there is potential for even
greater savings,'' Sullivan said.
   Sullivan said the department, which includes HCFA, would again
propose legislation that would require all health insurers to
provide information identifying those enrolled in their plans who
may be eligible for Medicare.
   ``Although our efforts to convince the Office of Management and
Budget of the need for this legislation have been unsuccessful,''
recent findings of an HHS task force as well as news reports of
potential savings and possibile fraud highlight the need for
greater efforts, Sullivan said.
   The Justice Department has said it is reviewing a number of
cases referred by HHS in which authorities believe Medicare paid
medical bills for which private carriers were liable.
   The department's civil division recently filed lawsuits against
two private insurance companies to recover money the government
claims should not have been paid by Medicare.
   The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that its
investigation of HCFA records shows as much as $10 billion may have
been misspent over the last six years because the agency has failed
to correct the billing problem.
   Medicare currently is paying about $67 million this year to 88
commercial insurance companies that serve as claims processors to
identify claims where private insurance carriers _ sometimes their
own _ are liable.
   HHS Inspector General Richard Kusserow and others have said they
are concerned about a possible conflict of interest in these
companies' roles as a Medicare contractor and commercial insurance
carrier.

<TEXT>
   The Leaning Tower of Pisa will be measured
every three months instead of just once a year to see if seasonal
change affects the landmark, scientists said Monday.
   Since 1913, the angle of the 800-year-old tower's lean has been
measured every year in June. This year a reading was taken in
March, and other measurements will be taken in June, September and
December.
   ``There is no particular cause for alarm,'' said Brunetto Palla,
a professor at the University of Pisa. ``We are curious to see
whether the change of seasons has an affect on the tower.''
   The collapse of a 900-year-old tower in Pavia on March 17 has
raised concerns over the stability and safety of Italy's monuments.
Four people were killed.
   The March measurements showed no notable variation from June
1988, Palla said.
   The monument began to lean shortly after its construction in
1173 when the soil beneath the 180-foot marble monument shifted.

<HEAD>Botha Asks Mandela To Promote Peaceful Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha said Monday
the government will ``react with magnanimity'' if jailed black
leader Nelson Mandela offers to promote a peaceful settlement in
South Africa.
   Botha's speech in Parliament appeared no different from previous
government offers to free the 70-year-old African National Congress
leader on condition he renounces his guerrilla organization's use
of violence. Mandela has refused.
   It would be futile for the government to release Mandela if his
freedom led to heightened conflict or if he was re-arrested, Botha
said.
   He cautioned he could not take any steps that may lead to ``the
rejection of democratic principles and the destruction of private
initiative and free enterprise.'' This appeared to be his view of
what South Africa would be like under the ANC, which espouses
socialism.
   ``For these reasons, the case of Mr. Mandela is being treated
with circumspection,'' said Botha, 73, who plans to retire after
elections expected by mid-September.
   Mandela, considered by many South African blacks as their
paramount leader, has been imprisoned since 1962 on a life sentence
for plotting to sabotage the white-minority government. He has been
living in a staff house at a prison farm near Cape Town since he
recovered from a bout of tuberculosis last year.
   If Mandela shows he is willing to contribute to a peaceful
settlement in South Africa, ``the government will react with
magnanimity,'' Botha said.
   On another topic, the South African leader acknowledged he has
had differences recently with members of his National Party, but
said he will ensure the disputes do not become ``unbridgeable
divisions.''
   ``There should not be attempts to drive a wedge between us,'' he
said.
   Botha suffered a stroke in January, and shortly after resigned
as party leader. Several Nationalist officials and newspapers then
urged Botha to step down as president in favor of the new party
leader, Education Minister F.W. de Klerk.

<HEAD>Scientific Group Says Don't Rush to Restart Tritium Production</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven prominent scientists are urging the
government not to rush into new production of tritium, an important
constituent of nuclear weapons, until the Soviet Union has been
sounded out about reductions in the nuclear stockpile.
   Tritium decays and must be replenished in nuclear weapons from
time to time. None has been produced in the United States since the
aging reactors at the Energy Department's Savannah River, S.C.,
plant were shut down a year ago for safety upgrading
   Officials have testified that at least one reactor must be
restarted by the end of the year or the need for new tritium will
become critical. Some members of Congress have said failure to
restart production would amount to unilateral nuclear disarmament.
   The Energy Department plans to spend $7.5 billion to build two
new tritium-producing reactors that could be ready in 10 years.
   In a statement dated Sunday, the 11 scientists said that once
the options were studied, ``it would be surprising not to find that
tritium requirements to maintain a fully adequate stockpile'' of
weapons could be met for about five years without additional
production.
   `It should not take as long as five years, however, to determine
whether the START and other arms-reduction negotiations are likely
to produce cuts sufficient to permit continued suspension of
tritium production,'' the scientists said.
   Their statement was organized by the Nuclear Control Institute,
which has advocated a similar position. The signers included two
Nobel Prize winners and three former staff members of the Los
Alamos National Laboratory, the principal nuclear weapons research
and development installation.
   A spokesman for the Energy Department did not immediately return
a telephone call seeking comment.
   The fusion of atoms of tritium, which is hydrogen containing two
neutrons instead of none, is the driving force of thermonuclear
weapons. Other weapons use the neutron burst from the fusion of
small amounts of tritium to accelerate or ``boost'' the fission
reactions of plutonium, reducing the amount of plutonium required
for the same explosive yield.
   Weapons are loaded with a surplus of tritium and reloaded when
all the surplus is gone. The reloading cycle is a secret and
presumably varies from weapon to weapon. The scientists noted
published reports that the reloading cycle is four to six years for
current weapons and 10 years for new submarine-launched missiles.
   The scientists advocated more frequent reloading with a smaller
surplus and the use of tritium from warheads withdrawn under treaty
terms or simply retired.
   ``Some may already have been taken into account, and some may
not provide much relief. But certainly these, and any other similar
examples, should be exploited before it is concluded that there is
any imminent crisis,'' the group said.
   The 11 scientists are Hans Bethe, retired professor of physics
at Cornell University; Freeman Dyson, professor of physics at the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.; Herman Feshbach,
retired professor of physics at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology; Val Fitch, professor of physics at Princeton
University; Marvin Goldberger, director of the Institute for
Advanced Study; Kurt Gottfried, professor of physics at Cornell;
Milton Hoenig, scientific director of the Nuclear Control
Institute; Franklin Long, retired professor of chemistry at
Cornell; J. Carson Mark, consultant; George Rathjens, professor of
political science at MIT and Victor Weisskopf, retired professor of
physics at MIT.
   Bethe and Fitch hold the Nobel Prize in physics and Bethe, Mark
and Weisskopf formerly worked at Los Alamos. All 11 have advised or
worked in federal government agencies.

<HEAD>Government Warns of Measures Against Chilean Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities asked workers to ignore calls
for a general strike Tuesday that would be the first mass protest
against the military government since 1987.
   The General Workers Central, the country's largest labor
movement, called the work stoppage to protest banishment of its two
top leaders involved in the last major protest strike in October
1987.
   That strike against the government of President Augusto Pinochet
failed to halt most activities in the country, but it ignited
violence that left three people dead.
   The government said Monday it has taken ``all the necessary
measures'' to maintain public order and ``guarantee the rights of
those wanting to work.''
   Interior Subsecretary Gonzalo Garcia urged workers ``not to be
afraid to go to work tomorrow.''
   Garcia did not elaborate on the anti-strike measures taken by
authorities. In the past, the government has mobilized thousands of
police and army troops during such protests.
   A series of mass protests shook the military government from
1983 to 1986, leaving at least 200 dead.
   The federation urged all the nation's workers to boycott work
Tuesday and to keep their children home from school.
   A number of trade unions and a coalition of 17 opposition
parties have said they will join the strike. Opposition
politicians, however, have openly said they do not expect a
significant work stoppage.
   The president of the opposition-controlled Workers Central,
Manuel Bustos, and vice president Arturo Martinez were sentenced to
internal exile in small provincial towns last year.
   They were charged with promoting violence and breaking state
security law.
   The federation also is demanding an increase of the minimum wage
from $55 to $100 a month.
   Diego Olivares, acting president of the labor federation, said
Monday the strike ``should be entirely peaceful,'' but some leftist
groups are calling for street demonstrations in Santiago and other
cities. Police said the demonstrations will not be allowed.
   Three bombs went off in Santiago on Sunday night, causing damage
but no casualties. No one claimed responsibility, but police said
they found pro-strike pamphlets nearby.

<HEAD>Suit Filed to Halt Base Closings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An organization representing federal employees
filed suit Monday to prevent the closing of U.S. military bases,
charging that the law creating the federal commission that
recommends base closings is unconstitutional.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court by the National
Federation of Federal Employees against the United States, said the
Base Closure and Realignment Act violates the Constitution ``by
improperly delegating the important legislative function of
regulating the disposition of government property, to the unelected
secretary of defense, and to the unelected members of the
commission.''
   The suit also said that the Constitution requires that Congress
provide for the nation's defense. The base closure law calls for
the commission's recommendations to be accepted in their entirety
and denies Congress the right to determine ``the logistical
arrangements for the U.S. military forces in the 21st century,''
the suit said.
   The union represents 5,000 employees at George Air Force Base
and Norton Air Force Base in California, and Chanute Air Force Base
in Illinois. All are scheduled to be closed.
   Congress approved legislation in October 1988 requiring the
defense secretary to close and realign bases according to the
panel's report. Two months later, the commission recommended
closing 86 bases, partly closing five more and changing the mission
of 54 others.
   Former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci approved the
commission's report in January.
   The House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution to
disapprove the base closing recommendations. Last month, the House
Armed Services Committee, by a vote of 43-4, supported the
recommendations; the full House is expected to do the same.
   James M. Peirce, president of the union, said the commission
based its decision on ``erroneous and out-of-date information. To
put it simply, the commission blew it and it doesn't appear as if
the majority of Congress gives a damn.''
   The union is seeking a declaratory judgment from the courts on
whether the Base Closure and Realignment Act is unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Italian Scientists Report Achieving Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts and news reports said Monday that Italian
scientists had created nuclear fusion at room temperature in a
small container.
   Scientists at the National Agency for Alternative Energy in
Frascati, outside Rome, measured neutrons being emitted from their
experiment, said a scientist familiar with the work.
   ``They saw a lot of neutrons; that means fusion,'' said
Francesco Celani of the National Institute of Nuclear Physics, who
worked with the Frascati group.
   The scientists were trying to copy an experiment by Martin
Fleischmann of the University of Southampton, England, and Stanley
Pons of the University of Utah, who announced last month they had
achieved nuclear fusion in a glass beaker at room temperature.
   Fleischmann and Pons claimed their experiment yielded four times
the energy put into it.
   If they are correct, the result could be a relatively
inexpensive energy source that is virtually inexhaustible. No
scientists have managed to duplicate the energy burst reported in
the experiment, however, and many experts believe the two
scientists made a mistake.
   Several universities have said they confirmed parts of the
Fleischmann-Pons experiment.
   Another researcher, Steven Jones of Brigham Young University in
Utah, says he also created nuclear fusion but the energy output was
virtually nil.
   Pierluigi Sani, public relations director of the Frascati
agency, refused to confirm Italian media reports that scientists
there had achieved fusion. A news conference has been scheduled for
Tuesday, and ``officially we can't say anything until tomorrow,''
he said.
   Celani said the scientists at Frascati checked for neutrons but
not energy emission.
   Fusion is the process powering the sun, in which tremendous
amounts of energy are released when the cores of two hydrogen atoms
fuse. By contrast, nuclear power plants get energy from fission,
the splitting of atoms.
   Most scientists seeking a way to harness nuclear fusion have
used extremely high temperatures and machines the size of houses to
jam atoms together.
   Jones, Pons and Fleischmann used electrical current to herd
hydrogen atoms into metal electrodes, where the hydrogen atoms
apparently fused because of proximity.
   In the Frascati experiment, scientists forced hydrogen atoms
into titanium and, according to Celani, lowered the temperature of
the experiment to enhance fusion.

   A Coast Guard jet from the air station on Cape Cod and a C-130

<TEXT>
   Fugitive financier Robert Vesco was
added Monday as a defendant in a drug-conspiracy indictment,
accused of persuading his Cuban hosts to allow cocaine-laden
airplanes to fly over Cuba en route to the Bahamas.
   Vesco, a fugitive since the Nixon administration, was indicted
on one count alleging he conspired to import cocaine into the
United States.
   Vesco is believed to have lived in Cuba since 1982, after
bouncing around the Bahamas, the Caribbean and Costa Rica. He has
been wanted in the United States since 1973 on charges of looting
an investment firm, Investors Overseas Services, of $224 million.
   The federal indictment charged that in October 1984, Colombian
cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas sent a messenger from Nicaragua
to Cuba asking Vesco to use his influence in Cuba to arrange for
Lehder's aircraft to fly over Cuba on smuggling runs from Nicaragua
to Andros Island in the Bahamas.
   A few days later, Vesco, ``in the presence of another
individual'' supplied Lehder's messenger with a document approving
the cocaine overflights. The other person was not identified in the
indictment.
   The United States and Cuba don't have normal diplomatic
relations or an extradition agreement. The Cuban government has
denied playing host to Vesco.
   Vesco's name was added as 15 other defendants, including
Lehder's former wife, faced arraignment in federal court in what
prosecutors call the ``son of Lehder'' cocaine-conspiracy case.
   Lehder is believed to be one of the architects of the Medellin
cartel, a Colombian drug-smuggling organization that is blamed for
80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States.
   Lehder, 39, was convicted in May in Jacksonville of cocaine
smuggling and operating a continuing criminal enterprise and is
serving a life sentence plus 135 years in federal prison in Marion,
Ill.
   Most of those charged in the latest indictment, unsealed in
March, were mentioned in testimony during Lehder's trial.
   In addition, key members of the Medellin cartel also were
indicted, as well as Everette Bannister, a Nassau businessman and
close associate of Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling.
   Bannister and the reputed leaders of the cartel _ Pablo Escobar
Gaviria, Jose Gonzalo Rodriquez Gacha, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, Fabi
Ochoa Vasquez and Gonzalo Mejia _ remained at large Monday.
   But 15 co-defendents, most of whom were freed on bail after
their arrests in March, were ordered to appear before U.S.
Magistrate Harvey Schlesinger. They included Yemel Nacel, who was
once married to Lehder.
   All 15 are accused of playing relatively minor roles in the drug
dealing, some of which occurred as long as a decade ago.
   Ms. Nacel, who now lives in New York City, is accused only of
helping count some of Lehder's money in 1978 in Beverly Hills,
Calif.
   Also facing new charges is Jack Carlton Reed, the co-defendant
in Lehder's trial who is serving a 15-year prison sentence. Reed
faces a possible life sentence if convicted of operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller, who along with former
U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle prosecuted Lehder, said he expects
to face strenuous defense arguments, including the statute of
limitations and duration of the alleged conspiracy from 1974 to
1989.

<HEAD>House Approves Bill To Make King Holiday Commission Permanent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved legislation Monday to make
the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission a permanent
agency with authorized spending of $500,000.
   The legislation, sponsored by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., passed
the House on a 305-84 vote. A similar measure is pending in the
Senate, which failed to act before adjourning last year on a
House-passed bill to make the commission permanent.
   The commission was established by Congress in 1984 to
institutionalize the federal holiday in honor of the slain civil
rights leader. Authorization for the commission expires May 1.
   Conyers told the House on Monday that the commission is needed
more now than ever before because most young people have no first
hand knowledge of the civil rights movement.
   While the commission has received no federal funds in the past,
Conyers and other supporters of the bill argued that the $500,000
annual authorization is needed because private funds for the
panel's work have been drying up.
   The Senate bill, sponored by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., would extend
the commission for five years at a cost of $1.5 million.

<HEAD>First Lady Lauds Volunteer Effort in Literacy Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush, saying nearly all of society's
benefits flow from literacy, praised a young woman Monday who
learned to read and broke free from the welfare cycle.
   Addressing more than 3,000 volunteer leaders at a United Way
national conference, the first lady said: ``You are at the heart of
virtually every worthy cause there is.''
   Mrs. Bush praised United Way for its help and funding of such
organizations as Red Cross and the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and
causes as diverse as combatting child abuse and comforting young
AIDS patients.
   Then, turning to the cause that has been the focus of her own
volunteer leadership, Mrs. Bush said as many as 25 percent of
Americans struggle with literacy.
   ``Literacy is everybody's business,'' she said. ``The need for
literacy is linked to every other important need in society ...
housing, nutrition, health ... employment.''
   To illustrate the point, Mrs. Bush's address was followed by a
videotape about Evelyn Vega, a 29-year-old Stamford, Conn.,
resident and mother of three children, who broke 11 years of
welfare dependence by learning to read and getting a job.
   Mrs. Vega dropped out of high school during her first pregnancy
and was the third generation of her family to live on public
assistance. The film showed her receiving reading lessons from
United Way volunteer Paige Oristano and working as the assistant
manager at a fast-food restaurant.
   After the film, Mrs. Vega, who since has become a United Way
volunteer, read from a letter she had written Mrs. Bush to thank
her for supporting literacy programs.
   ``It is hard and scary to get off welfare. You cannot do it by
yourself. People like me need someone out there to teach them how
to make that dream come true because it is all new to them. ... I
still feel scared,'' she said, her voice choking with tears.
   Mrs. Vega presented the first lady with a copy of the letter and
the two women hugged briefly as the gathering rose to its feet and
applauded. Overcome with emotion, Mrs. Vega kissed Mrs. Bush's
cheek.
   Later Monday, Mrs. Bush traveled to the Museum of Science and
Industry on the South Side, where she officially opened an exhibit
on the brain and learning disabilities.
   The permanent exhibit, called ``Learning and Learning
Disabilties: Explorations of the Human Brain,'' is the first of its
kind in the nation.
   `This is truly an exhibit of hope,'' the first lady said. ``I
applaud the museum for addressing this misunderstood subject in a
public forum.''
   The exhibit uses touch screens, video monitors, mannequins and
giant brain models to show how the brain changes as it learns and
how disabilties alter that process.

   Here are excerpts from the summary of the
special counsel's report to the House ethics committee on
allegations against House Speaker Jim Wright.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>II. SUMMARY OF FACTS AND CONCLUSIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The facts discovered during the Preliminary Inquiry demonstrate
that Wright has violated, at times repeatedly (Special Outside
Counsel believes that Wright committed 116 violations of House
Rules), House Rule XLIII, clauses 1 (conduct reflecting
discreditably on the House) and 4 (accepting improper gifts); House
Rule XLIV (failing to disclose income and gifts); House Rule XLVII,
clause 1 (exceeding the limit on outside earned income); Code of
Ethics for Government Service, consideration 5 (receiving favors
which may influence performance of government duties); and 2 U.S.C.
441i (retaining excessive honoraria). These violations occurred
over the period from 1978 through 1988 during which Wright
committed the following acts:
   _In 1979, Wright accepted an interest in a successful natural
gas well from Texas oilman, the late Monty Moncrief, which was an
unreported gift worth approximately $82,000-$90,000.
   _From 1984 through 1987, Wright received approximately $54,600
in unreported gifts, honoraria, and other outside income from
lobbyists and special interest groups styled as ``royalties'' from
the sale of his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   _From time to time from 1978 through 1988, Wright received
approximately $150,000 in unreported gifts from Texas real estate
developer, George Mallick, in the form of reduced interest on a
loan; procurement of a loan; salary paid to Betty Wright for work
not performed; free and below-market value housing in Fort Worth;
and the use of a 1979 Cadillac Seville in Washington, D.C.
   _In 1986 and 1987, Wright improperly used his position in the
House leadership to exercise undue influence on the actions taken
by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to control the burgeoning
savings and loan crisis in Texas and elsewhere.
   The following is a summary of facts discovered and conclusions
reached by Special Outside Counsel on each of the six areas of
inquiry set forth in the Committee's Resolution. A detailed
exposition of the Preliminary Inquiry is provided beginning on page
25 of this Report.

<HEAD>A. Wright's Gas Well Investments With the Moncrief Family</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Beginning in late 1978, Wright intervened with the State
Depatment and the Egyptian government on behalf of the Neptune Oil
Company in order to secure for Neptune an opportunity to resolve a
dispute with Egypt over the right to explore, develop and operate
offshore oil fields in the Gulf of Suez. Neptune had a contract
with the State of Israel to explore and develop the
Israeli-occupied territory. However, as a result of the Camp David
accords in September 1978 and the subsequent peace treaty
negotiations, Israel was required to return the occupied Sinai and
Gulf of Suez territory to Egypt, relinquishing all rights to the
oil fields without compensation. Egypt would not recognize
Neptune's rights under the Israeli contract. Thus Neptune stood to
lose its investment and expected profit from the operation of the
oil fields.
   Wright introduced Richard Moncrief and other Neptune principals
to State Department officials, contacted Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance and Egyptian Ambassador Ashraf Ghorbal, and personally
delivered a letter to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat while he was
in Washington. Wright's intervention on behalf of Neptune Oil does
not in itself appear to have violated any law or ethical standard.
   However, the facts of certain investment opportunities provided
to Wright by the Moncrief family at the same time he was
intervening for Neptune demonstrate that Wright improperly received
a gift valued at more than $100 from Monty Moncrief, a person with
a direct interest in legislation before Congress. We were unable to
establish with the required certainty that the gift was
compensation for Wright's intercession on behalf of Neptune Oil.
   Wright accepted the opportunity to purchase part of the Moncrief
family interest in two east-Texas gas wells from Monty Moncrief,
the late patriarch of the Moncrief family who was for many years
active in Washington, D.C. as a lobbyist for the Independent
Petroleum Association. The first opportunity, the Whatley well,
appears to have been an ordinary, personal business transaction.
For example, Wright received a written offer to participate in
drilling the well; accepted the offer by written commitment to pay
his share of all drilling costs; obtained financing to pay for his
drilling costs; and actually paid those costs all prior to the time
gas was discovered in the well on July 11, 1979. Put another way,
he risked the amount of the drilling costs against the chance that
the well would be dry. Had the well been dry, the investment would
have been lost.
   Once gas was discovered in the Whatley well, although it was
commercially productive, it was clear that it would not be the
investment predicted by the Moncriefs. Production and, therefore,
profit from the well, if any, would be substantially less than had
been anticipated.
   In contrast, in Wright's second investment opportunity, the L.
D. Williams No. 1 well, Wright made no written commitment to pay
drilling costs and did not obtain financing or pay for any costs
until October 1979, long after gas was discovered in that well on
June 27, 1979. Thus unlike the Whatley investment, Wright invested
in Williams No. 1 already knowing that it was a commercially
successful well. The risk of losing his investment, which made
Whatley an ordinary business transaction, was absent in Williams
No. 1. Thus Wright received a gift worth aproximately
$82,000-$90,000, the difference between the drilling costs and the
increased value of the well after gas was discovered. Wright failed
to disclose his receipt of this gift on his Financial Disclosure
Statement for 1979.
   Wright also deferred paying two Moncrief invoices for Williams
No. 1 drilling costs without paying interest on the unpaid balance.
One invoice for $8,668.21 remained unpaid from October 19, 1979
until September 4, 1980. A second invoice for $7,703.64 remained
unpaid from April 18, 1980 until July 1, 1980. Although it appears
that Wright may have received interest-free loans from Monty
Moncrief for $8,688.21 for 10 months and $7,703.64 for two months _
gifts worth nearly $1,200 _ it is impossible to determine whether
Moncrief's failures to collect the overdue balances were intended
as gifts, or were merely bookkeeping oversights. Thus we cannot
conclude with the required certainty that Moncrief's failures to
collect interest were gifts to Wright.
   In 1984, at a time when the Whatley well was ``shut in'' i.e.,
had temporarily ceased production, Wright asked Monty Moncrief to
buy back his interest in the well. Wright was receiving no income
from the well and consequently he made no payments on his loan from
Continental National Bank. The bank's chairman stated that under
those circumstances he would have required other arrangements for
repayment of the nearly $20,000 outstanding balance.
   Monty Moncrief agreed to buy back the Whatley interest for
$20,000. While Moncrief's repurchase of Wright's interest in the
Whatley well appears to have been a favor to Wright, it also
appears to have been purchased at about the market value of the
interest. Therefore, there was no gift to Wright.

<HEAD>Overturned Platform Sinks After Floating North</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $42 million drilling platform that
capsized in heavy seas off South Carolina 10 days ago drifted more
than 280 miles to the northeast before finally sinking off North
Carolina, officials said Monday.
   The 27,500-ton structure sank shortly before 1 a.m. Sunday about
62 miles east of Cape Lookout, N.C., Coast Guard Chief Warrant
Officer Greg Johnson said.
   The platform was being towed from Puerto Rico to Gloucester,
Mass., for a pipeline project when it capsized April 7. No one was
aboard it. The platform, known as a jack-up rig, was used for
exploratory drilling and other underwater projects.
   Authorities are not sure why it overturned, but Johnson said
heavy seas contributed. The Coast Guard is investigating.
   After the platform capsized, it slowly sank, drifting northeast
with the Gulf Stream, Johnson said. A tug stayed with the rig to
make sure no ships ran into it, he said.
   An estimated 500 gallons of oil, hydraulic oil and diesel fuel
were aboard the platform, but officials don't feel that presents a
major environmental threat because the platform sank well off the
coast, in water 1{ miles deep, Johnson said.
   The platform, owned by Maitland Brothers Inc. of Littlestown,
Pa., was built in 1978 by Bethleham Steel for $42 million, said
company spokesman Edward McCormick.

<HEAD>Man Charged With Killing 18 Elderly Women Dies of AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who confessed to the serial murders of 18
elderly Parisian women died Monday of AIDS while awaiting trial,
prison officials said.
   Thierry Paulin, a 26-year-old native of Martinique, was arrested
Dec. 1, 1987, after a three-year manhunt for the killer of a large
group of elderly women between October 1984 and January 1986.
   The women all were between 60 and 83 years of age, and nearly
all were strangled, stabbed or smothered in their homes after being
severely beaten. Paulin told police that he stalked the women and
forced his way into their homes.
   Paulin had a record of arrests for thefts and drugs, but police
said the killings did not seem to be linked exclusively to money.
They said that during the interrogation, Paulin ``had trouble
distinguishing between all the attacks he had committed.''
   Paulin's fingerprints were found in the homes of at least seven
murder victims, police said at the time.
   Prison authorities, who declined to be identified in keeping
with prison policy, said Paulin tested positive for AIDS in 1986
and last year began suffering symptoms of the disease that attacks
and destroys the body's immune system.
   Paulin fell into a coma several days ago and was admitted to the
intensive care unit of Fresnes prison hospital over the weekend. He
died early Monday, authorities said without providing any other
details.
   Before his death, Paulin blamed several of the murders on his
accomplice, Jean-Thierry Mathuin, who was arrested shortly after
Paulin and remains in custody.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers.

<TEXT>
   North Korea canceled two negotiating
sessions, saying Monday that South Korea's arrest of a dissident
who visited the communist nation was part of a plan to undermine
efforts for better relations.
   Two letters from Pyongyang called off talks set for Tuesday on a
possible joint team for the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing, and an
April 26 session on arranging a meeting of the two prime ministers.
   The action appeared to threaten future negotiations between
South Korea and North Korea on easing their bitter rivalry in a
land divided since World War II.
   North Korea proposed the talks resume in July, but Seoul
officials said continuing the dialogue would have to be considered.
They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Both messages from North Korea were delivered at Panmunjom, the
truce village at the border, and released by the government of
President Roh Tae-woo in Seoul.
   They criticized South Korea for arresting the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan
for his visit last month to Pyongyang, where he discussed
reunification of the peninsula with President Kim Il Sung.
   Moon was arrested Thursday on his return to Seoul via Japan, and
charged with aiding anti-state groups and making an illegal visit
to North Korea.
   About 10,000 war veterans and supporters, shouting
anti-communist slogans, demonstrated Monday in Puchon, about 12
miles west of Seoul, denouncing Moon's trip and ``leftists trying
to destroy freedom and peace through revolution,'' according to the
South Korean news agency Yonhap.
   Thousands of radical students in Seoul and elsewhere fought riot
police or rallied to demand Moon's release, Yonhap said. No
injuries or arrests were reported.
   North Korea said Moon's arrest proved Seoul did not want to
improve relations. It is illegal for South Koreans to visit North
Korea without government permission.
   Paik Nam Jun, a senior North Korean official, said in the letter
suspending political talks that the charge against Moon of dealing
with an ``anti-state organization'' could only refer to North Korea.
   As a result, he said, ``the smooth conduct of the north-south
talks has been made impossible.'' Paik said North Korea hoped the
``atmosphere would improve'' and meetings could resume in July.
   The two nations have tried to improve relations through a series
of talks that began in 1988, but with little success.
   When Moon went to Pyongyang, the Seoul government cracked down
on dissidents and said Moon wanted to help North Korea seize
control of the entire peninsula. South Korea says talks with the
North may be conducted only by the government.
   Dissidents in the South have held violent protests demanding the
downfall of Roh's government, but they have little public support
and Moon's visit to North Korea appears to have damaged their cause.
   Many South Koreans who fear North Korea were infuriated by the
visit. Television showed Moon embracing Kim, who ordered the 1950
invasion that started the Korean War.
   The two Koreas technically remain at war because no peace treaty
was signed after the war ended in 1953.
   In other Korean developments Monday:
   _Daewoo Motor Co., a joint venture between the U.S.-based
General Motors Corp. and South Korea's Daewoo Group, halted
production in response to a wave of strikes by workers seeking
higher wages. Similar walkouts forced carmakers Hyundai Motor Co.
and Kia Motor Corp. to stop production last week. Officials said
the job actions threaten South Korea's economy. Also Monday, 5,000
taxi drivers threatened to strike for higher wages and improved
working conditions.
   _Eight senior lawmakers of South Korea's second largest
opposition party, the Reunification Democratic Party led by Kim
Young-sam, offered to resign over a scandal involving a party
lawmaker who bribed a rival candidate to drop out of a National
Assembly election. It was not clear if Kim would accept the
resignations.

   Local television in Soviet Georgia reported 14
people are missing after last week's deadly clash between troops
and pro-independence demonstrators, an official at the Georgian
news agency said Monday.
   Zurab Lomidze, deputy director of Gruzinform, also said a
midnight-5 a.m. curfew is being lifted Tuesday morning, and
soldiers and tanks that have occupied the Georgian capital for 11
days will begin leaving.
   Residents of Tbilisi have said 100 people disappeared after the
bloody clash April 9 and that many of them were killed in addition
to the 19 in the official death toll. Radio Moscow said 20 were
killed.
   Rolad Beridze of the Georgian Foreign Ministry denied reports of
a higher death toll, but he acknowledged that one of the 19 victims
had been shot. He said soldiers fired on a car violating the first
night of curfew on April 9, killing one man and wounding two
companions.
   In London, visiting Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov said authorities overreacted to the Georgian protest.
   He also told Channel 4 television, ``And the authorities, they
accepted the blame and the secretary of the party of Georgia
stepped down, the prime minister stepped down and president stepped
down. So they all accepted their responsibility.''
   Tbilisi residents dispute official reports that soldiers were
ordered to clear the square because the demonstrators were
threatening to seize power from the government. One resident
branded as ``an outrageous lie'' an official statement that
protesters were killed in an panicked crush.
   ``There was no crush of people, there were no extremist
slogans,'' said resident Lasha Tabukashvili.
   Witnesses say the troops attacked a peaceful crowd with clubs,
shovels and poison gas, chasing down fleeing women and teens to
beat them to death.
   ``It's a cover-up,'' charged Naira Gipashvili, who also was
interviewed by telephone.
   Foreign correspondents remain barred from the republic.
   Gipashvili noted that the Georgian health minister said on local
television that many people were injured by the poison gas.
Activists and Tbilisi residents said a number of people died from
poison gas, but the national media have said nothing about chemical
attacks.
   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, a Georgian who has been
leading the Moscow delegation to Tbilisi, said on national
television Monday night that officials decided to lift the curfew
after a series of meetings Sunday.
   Shevardnadze said enforcing a curfew on a Soviet city ``is not a
mission for the Soviet army.''
   Three Georgian activists, two of them leaders of a committee
calling for a general strike in Tbilisi, have been arrested, Moscow
activist Alexander Podrabinek said Monday.
   Podrabinek, the editor of the dissident journal
Express-Khronika, identified the three as David Bardavelidze and
Ucha Dzidzava, both students and leaders of a strike committee, and
Irakli Batryashvili, member of one of the informal groups that
organized the initial pro-independence demonstration.
   Demonstrations in Georgia first began April 4 when protesters
criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian
minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by
Georgians.
   Other protesters have demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet
Union because of alleged interference from the central government.
   In the Baltic republic of Lithuania, about 30,000 people rallied
Sunday for three hours in the city of Vilnius to mourn the victims
in Georgia, according to Valdas Anelauskas, a local journalist for
Express-Khronika. No arrests or violence were reported.

   Luxembourg, a nation smaller than the state of
Rhode Island, marks its 150th anniversary Tuesday determined to
survive among the great powers that spawned its independence.
   A speck on the world map _ tucked between France, West Germany
and Belgium - the grand duchy has used its position on the
crossroads of Europe's main cultures to maintain one of the highest
standards of living in the world.
   ``Don't mix us up with countries that are even smaller than
ours,'' said Lex Roth, a government spokesman.
   Luxembourg, with a population of 372,000, became independent of
the Netherlands under the 1839 Treaty of London signed by the
European powers.
   Since then its fate has been determined by close cooperation
with its neighbors _ an inevitable option for a nation that covers
only 999 square miles. Rhode Island is 1,214 square miles.
   ``It is essential a small state like us can survive and develop
by keeping its independence only within great frameworks,'' Prime
Minister Jacques Santer, who heads a center-left coalition
government, said recently.
   Luxembourg is a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and an ardent member of the European Economic
Community.
   It is home for a number of EEC institutions, including the
European Investment Bank and the European Court of Justice.
Luxembourg license plates display the EEC flag of 12 gold stars in
a field of royal blue.
   Tuesday's independence celebrations will be attended by foreign
dignitaries from many nations, including West Germany, Britain, the
Soviet Union and France.
   In recent decades, Luxembourg has become a financial center. The
city of Luxembourg, with a population of 75,000, has more than 100
banks from around the world and the banking industry employs 10
percent of the work force and accounts for a quarter of the
national income.
   The financial institutions have helped keep unemployment at
about 1.5 percent, by far the lowest in the 12-nation EEC.
   Immigrants account for 27 percent of the population, the highest
in the EEC.
   Problems involving immigrants do exist, Roth said, but without
the violence that mars coexistence in many other European nations.
Although they have no voting rights, ``our Portuguese and Italian
fellow citizens have all the same social rights as Luxembourgers,''
he said.
   To improve integration, a relaxed naturalization process in
recent years has made it easier for immigrants to gain citizenship.
   Language poses a problem for foreigners from southern Europe,
Roth said. Most Luxembourgers speak German and French along with
Luxembourgish, a German dialect.
   But Roth added: ``We're a good blend. The French are more
impulsive, the Germans more heavy-handed,'' giving Luxembourgers
balance and patience.

<HEAD>Jury Weighs Sentence for Shopping Center Killer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARTOW, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted of slaying six people at a
shopping center wept as relatives testifying at his sentencing
described how he cared for his mother and ailing wife.
   It was the first public display of emotion by William Bryan
Cruse during the long trial and numerous court appearances for the
shooting rampage in Palm Bay two years ago that claimed the lives
of two police officers and four other people.
   Cruse, 61, was convicted April 5 on 32 counts of murder,
attempted murder and kidnapping. The jury that found him guilty
must recommend to Circuit Judge John Antoon whether Cruse should be
sentenced to death or life in prison.
   Cruse cried when his niece, Rebbeca J. Thompson of Lexington,
Ky., told jurors that he doted on his wife, who had Parkinson's
disease.
   ``He was always there for her,'' Mrs. Thompson said. ``They
never had children, but they had each other.''
   She said her uncle visited his mother every day in a nursing
home until her death in 1980.
   Joyce K. Cruse, widow of the convicted man's brother, said the
defendant ``took good care of his mother. He would come over and
fix her breakfast. If she was ill, he would stay all night. ... We
all loved him and still do.''
   Earlier, Assistant State Attorney Chris White said Cruse should
be put to death because he committed the murders in a ``cold,
calculated, premeditated fashion.''
   But Assistant Public Defender Paul Arlt said witnesses would
show Cruse was severely mentally disturbed at the time of the
crime, had a reduced capacity to realize the consequences of his
actions, did not realize he had hurt anyone and that his mental
condition was aggravated by alcohol.

<HEAD>STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE</HEAD>
<HEAD>ON STANDARDS OF OFFICIAL CONDUCT</HEAD>
<HEAD>IN THE MATTER OF</HEAD>
<HEAD>REPRESENTATIVE JAMES C. WRIGHT JR.</HEAD>
<HEAD>April 13, 1989</HEAD>
<HEAD>Background: The Preliminary Inquiry, Procedural Matters, and Precedents</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   On June 9, 1988, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct
voted to undertake a preliminary inquiry into certain assertions of
improper conduct raised against House Speaker James C. Wright Jr.
The Resolution of Preliminary Inquiry indicated the committee's
decision to ascertain whether Representative Wright committed
violations of the Code of Official Conduct, or a law, rule,
regulation or other standard of conduct involving _
   1. The circumstances surrounding lobbying efforts on behalf of a
constituent with whom he had an interest in a private gas well
venture;
   2. The circumstances surrounding intervention in a matter before
the Department of the Interior on behalf of Texas Oil &amp; Gas Company;
   3. Whether campaign funds were used, directly or indirectly, to
pay for publication of a book from which he received a 55 percent
royalty;
   4. Whether government resources were improperly used to complete
work on a book from which he received royalties;
   5. The use of a condominium in Fort Worth, Texas; and
   6. The possible exercise of undue influence in dealing with
officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   On July 26, 1988, the committee appointed a Special Outside
Counsel (hereinafter also referred to as ``Counsel''), Richard J.
Phelan, to conduct the Preliminary Inquiry. The appointment was
made to assure that the investigation would not be subject to
claims that the matter was not handled in a fair and objective
manner. In addition, the committee received sworn testimony from
Representative Wright on September 14, 1988, regarding the areas
under investigation. At the time of his appearance, Representative
Wright, who was accompanied by his counsel, also responded to
questions asked by members of the committee. Because the committee
did not complete the Preliminary Inquiry prior to the end of the
100th Congress, the investigation was reauthorized for completion
by the committee at its first meeting of the 101st Congress on
January 4, 1989.
   During the course of the Preliminary Inquiry, the Special
Outside Counsel and his staff obtained the sworn testimony of over
70 witnesses and examined thousands of documents. Based upon the
information obtained, Mr. Phelan submitted a Report to the
Committee on February 21, 1989, containing counsel's legal and
factual findings.
   Subsequent to submission of the Special Outside Counsel's
Report, the committee began a three-phase decisionmaking process.
First, the committee committed one full week, which was designated
as a ``reading period'' to allow all committee members to read
counsel's report and supporting materials. In the second phase, the
committee received an extensive oral presentation by the Special
Outside Counsel and his staff and then by counsel for
Representative Wright, who were accorded an opportunity to hear and
respond to the Special Outside Counsel's presentation. During the
second phase, questions were asked of both counsel in order to
obtain the greatest perspective on the matters addressed during the
Preliminary Inquiry as well as to put to rest any concern that
Representative Wright had been denied a full and fair opportunity
to respond to the Special Outside Counsel's findings, particularly
where improper conduct was believed possibly to have occurred.
Immediately upon the conclusion of the oral presentations, the
committee commenced phase three, deliberations on the matters it
had received.
   The committee has completed its three-phase review process and
is today announcing the decisions made in the matter of the
Preliminary Inquiry regarding Representative Wright.
   First, at the beginning of its deliberations, the committee
decided that it would release the complete text of the Report of
the Special Outside Counsel simultaneous with any Statement of
Alleged Violation if such a statement was to be issued in
connection with the subject case. Under Rule 11(b) of the
committee's Rules of Procedure, a Statement of Alleged Violation
may be issued if the committee determines there is ``reason to
believe that the violation occurred.'' Should such an alleged
violation become the subject of a disciplinary hearing, under Rule
16(e), the committee staff has the burden of proof to establish
``clearly and convincingly by the evidence'' that fact of a
violation. Second, the committee decided that, in the event it
determined not to take action on matters addressed in the Special
Outside Counsel's Report, it would make public its views on why no
further action was being taken in order to avoid any claim that a
matter not pursued was ``ignored'' as opposed to having been the
subject of full committee consideration. ...
   The discussion that follows is presented in the order in which
specific areas of investigation were identified in the committee's
June 9, 1988, Resolution of Preliminary Inquiry. As appropriate,
the discussion will either explain why the committee determined no
further action should be taken or why a Statement of Alleged
Violation is being issued, along with the complete text of the
Statement of Alleged Violation. In this regard, the committee
emphasizes that while the following discussion presents those
actions taken, it is not intended either to set forth all of the
facts or information obtained by the Special Outside Counsel or to
be viewed as a substitute for the detailed analysis contained in
counsel's February 21, 1989, report.
   Individuals desirous of all relevant facts should consult the
counsel's report which is being made publicly available with this
committee statement.

<HEAD>National Drug Czar Finds Good Will To Help Combat Drugs In Washington
Area</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug czar William J. Bennett emerged Monday
from a meeting with officials from metropolitan Washington _ but
not Mayor Marion Barry _ saying he found ``good will on their
part'' to help his plan to combat drug abuse and related violence
in the area.
   Barry, whose administration was attacked by Bennett a week ago
as having ``failed to serve its citizens,'' did not attend the
meeting because he was testifying before a Senate panel. Barry
asked the Senate Appropriations Committee's District of Columbia
panel to assign 500 federal police officers to aid the drug fight.
   Bennett's meeting Monday was marked by confusion among local
officials about what the plan meant, if the war on drugs would end
at the District boundary line and whether they would get stuck with
a new prison for Washington criminals. Bennett's office invited the
mayors of 11 local cities and eight counties as well as the
governors of Maryland and Virginia.
   The mayors and county officials who attended the hourlong
meeting told reporters afterward they were pleased their areas
would be included for intelligence gathering and law enforcement
efforts by a new task force, but Baltimore Mayor Curt Schmoke said,
``There were still many more questions than answers today....
   ``What I got from my understanding today was that this plan is
evolving, that this is just the first phase, and that's why we're
still in a situation where there are still a lot of questions on
our minds,'' Schmoke said.
   Bennett's criticism of and estrangement from Barry has brought
up questions about whether they can work together to combat the
drug problem that has made Washington the nation's murder capital.
   Bennett said Monday that he had not spoken directly with Barry
since the plan for Washington was announced a week earlier, but
said he had invited the mayor to attend the meeting and he urged
reporters to drop the issue.
   ``We are not in the process of developing a relationship; we are
trying to respond to the drug problem,'' Bennett said. ``This issue
about whether Marion Barry and I will stand up in public and put
our arms around each other is not the issue, and you ought to get
off it.''
   Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who met with Bennett later
in the day, said, ``The issue is not Barry vs. Bennett. It is
drug-pushing terrorists against a civilized society. My sense is
that Barry is not feuding with Mr. Bennett. Mr. Bennett certainly
is not feuding with Mr. Barry.''
   On Sunday, Jackson had toured Washington and played some
basketball with Barry and had criticized Bennett's plan for
Washington, saying it was too limited in scope. But there was no
public criticism of Bennett on Monday.
   Bennett selected Washington as a ``test case'' for the drug war
and has said he plans to use what he learns from the various
approaches tried here to help him compile the national drug control
strategy, which is due in another 4{ months.
   Washington became the nation's murder capital last year with 372
murders, most of them drug-related. So far this year, there have
been 145 slayings, compared with 96 at the same time in 1988.
   Bennett's plan, among other things, called for creation of a
metropolitan area task force of law enforcement agents with of 57
more federal officials, construction of the pretrial detention
facility and a 700-bed federal prison.
   Among the questions still open was the location of a 500-bed
pretrial detention facility. Bennett praised the officials who
attended the meeting Monday for their understanding that ``with
positions of responsibility come responsibilities to act on certain
things.'' But he criticized the ``not-in-my-back-yard'' attitude
many people have about prisons.
   ``Everybody wants to wage the war on drugs, but there are fewer
volunteers for the building of prisons,'' Bennett said. ``We may
not want prisons in our county or in our part of the state, but in
some areas the choice may be between having the bad guys in the
back yard or the prison in the back yard.''
   Bennett said the purpose of Monday's meeting ``was to inform the
good, local, responsible officials of a little more detail'' on the
plan. ``I want to stress the degree of good will on their part,
they are interested, they're on board, they want to see this
problem solved.''

<HEAD>Sanguinetti Says Referendum Settles Amnesty Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Julio M. Sanguinetti said
Monday the question of amnesty for human rights abuses under
military rule has been settled by voter approval of the amnesty law
his government passed in 1986.
   With 7,037 of 7,072 districts reporting in Sunday's referendum,
the vote was 1,013,554 for amnesty, or 52.62 percent, and 771,942 _
40.08 percent _ who wanted the law discarded.
   Sanguinetti, a 52-year-old lawyer, told reporters Monday: ``Now
the discussion has ended.''
   When asked whether his government would consider a compromise
with opponents of amnesty, since they got nearly 41 percent of the
vote, he replied:
   ``They were the ones who chose this way. They were the ones who
submitted the law to a majority vote. ... National peace is to
accept the verdict of the ballot box.''
   Blank or invalid ballots, and others classed as questionable
that may or may not be counted, totaled 140,703, or 7.3 percent of
the votes cast. About 85 percent of eligible voters participated.
   The amnesty law forbids prosecution of about 180 soldiers and
police accused of torture, murder and other crimes in 1973-85, when
the military ruled Uruguay and conducted what it called a war on
leftist subversion.
   It was passed by the new civilian government in December 1986,
after officers made clear they would not answer charges in the
courts.
   Three military uprisings have occurred in neighboring Argentina
during the past two years because of the same issue. Argentina
returned to civilian government in 1983 after nearly eight years of
military rule and has tried many officers, including former junta
members.
   Uruguayans voted on amnesty because the National Commission for
a Referendum gathered 634,000 petition signatures during 1987, more
than the required 25 percent of registered voters.
   Sanguinetti said his goal was to consolidate democracy in this
nation of 3 million people, which was an example of representative
government to Latin America before 1973, and ``in this case, peace
is justice.''
   He told the news conference amnesty does not excuse or justify
military abuses, which included the executions of about 150
Uruguayans, arrests and disappearances of 200 more and the torture
of several thousand.
   It must be remembered, he said, that military intervention
followed years of terrorism and economic chaos. Sanguinetti said
leftist Tupamaro guerrillas were released from prison in 1985 and
the military amnesty ``is on the same line.''
   ``There is no sense of triumph'' in the referendum's result, he
said, and added: ``The most important aspect in all this is that
the country was able to do it'' by popular vote. ``Yesterday at
7:30 p.m., when the ballot boxes were closed, Uruguay completed its
transition'' to democracy.
   The National Commission for a Referendum, and the human rights
and leftist political groups that supported the referendum,
apparently accepted the outcome.
   Only the small Communist Party said the vote was not fair,
claiming the government intimidated voters by hinting of trouble if
the amnesty was overturned.
   Matilde Rodriguez Larreta de Gutierrez, co-president of the
referendum commission, said: ``in accordance with the results of
the referendum, the amnesty has been confirmed. Without doubt, the
decision of the electorate should be accepted.''

<HEAD>Another Eastern Jet Seized With Cocaine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the relatively few Eastern Airlines jets
flying since the beginning of a strike against the carrier was
seized Monday by Customs after inspectors found 75 pounds of
cocaine in a mail bag in the cargo hold.
   It was the 14th seizure of cocaine on an Eastern plane since
September, and eight of those shipments were found in the mail, or
courier, bags.
   The Boeing 727 seized Monday landed in Miami after a flight from
Asuncion, Paraguay, that stopped in Bolivia, Peru and Panama, said
Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   Customs imposed a $1.2 million fine on Eastern and demanded a
letter of credit from the strike-hobbled airline before releasing
the plane.
   ``We hate to kick an airline while it's down, but we will not
allow illegal drugs into the country,'' Sheehan said.
   Because of Eastern's financial problems, Customs has decided to
cash in three previous credit letters worth about $3 million, he
said. The letters are usually held until Customs and the airline
negotiate an agreement on the fine.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said Customs will have to go
to bankruptcy court to get its money. ``We don't think that fining
airlines and seizing their aircraft is the way to stop drug
trafficking,'' said Ms. Ceremsak.
   She said the airline spent $3 million on security last year, an
amount that was not decreased this year even though Eastern has had
to severely shrink its schedule following the March 4 Machinists'
strike that was supported by pilots and flight attendants.
   But Sheehan said Eastern apparently wasn't doing the job, even
though smugglers were using the same method time after time.
   ``Due to the fact that over half of the seizure have been in
courier bags, we find it difficult to understand why courier bags
do not receive extra attention,'' Sheehan said. ``There shouldn't
be a courier bag on Eastern Airlines that isn't gone over with a
fine-toothed comb.''
   The bright blue and green bag, of a type used to carry mail, was
found during a routine inspection Monday by the Customs Contraband
Enforcement Team.
   It was not on the plane manifest, and authorities did not know
where it was put aboard the plane.
   No destination was listed on the bag, suggesting that someone
planned to remove it from the cargo hold in Miami, Sheehan said.
   Meanwhile, eight men who were Eastern baggage handlers at the
time of their 1986 indictment went on trial Monday in a smuggling
scheme. They are charged with conspiracy to import cocaine and
conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.

<HEAD>Fighting Poses Logistical Problems For U.N. Force</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. spokesman said Monday that the
fierce combat that broke out in northern Namibia at the outset of
the independence process has created severe logistical problems for
the U.N. monitoring force.
   Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the U.N. contingent that
is to oversee Namibia's transition to independence, said U.N.
personnel had planned to use vacated South African military
facilities.
   But because of clashes between security forces and guerrillas of
the South-West Africa People's Organization, South African troop
withdrawal has been delayed, he said. This has created ``enormous
competition'' for accommodation and other facilities in the
relatively underdeveloped northern region of Ovambo.
   Thornberry said the United Nations planned to start deploying
police monitors in Ovambo this week who will check actions of the
South African-led territorial police force. But he said it was hard
to find offices for monitors that were easily accessible to
civilians who might want to file complaints.
   The world body has urged civilians to report allegations of
harassment or intimidation by the security forces or SWAPO
supporters.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, SWAPO Foreign Secretary
Theo-Ben Gurirab said Monday that Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar should visit Namibia to restore public confidence in the
United Nations.
   Gurirab said a visit by the U.N. chief would help restore the
``tarnished'' image of the United Nations in the eyes of Namibians.
   He blamed the world organization for not stationing U.N.
peacekeepers in northern Namibia by April 1, the day a cease-fire
was supposed to take effect at the start of a yearlong transition
to independence but instead the day that SWAPO guerrillas fought
gun battles with South African-led security forces.
   Territorial officials say 278 guerrillas and 27 security force
members have been killed and 28 guerrillas captured.
   Thornberry said 2,662 members of the planned 4,650-member U.N.
military force were in Namibia by Monday, with 410 Kenyan
infantrymen due by Tuesday.
   South Africa said about 1,600 guerrillas crossed the border from
Angola in violation of an agreement that they stay at bases at
least 100 miles inside Angola. Up to 380 guerrillas returned to
Angola after withdrawal orders from their exiled leader, and about
900 remain in Namibia, South African offficials say.
   As of Monday, only seven guerrillas reported to U.N. checkpoints
established as part of a plan to give guerrillas safe passage back
to Angola. The others who withdrew did so on their own.
   Officials expressed doubt that guerrillas would venture near the
assembly points because of the heavy concentration of police and
soldiers around each area.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I. In December,
it agreed to allow independence in exchange for Cuba's withdrawing
its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.
   SWAPO has fought South African rule since 1966 and is favored to
get the most votes in pre-independence elections scheduled for
November.

   Similarly, when Moncrief agreed in June 1984 to take a ``farm
out'' from Wright of Wright's interest in the drilling of a second
Williams well (i.e., a buy-out of most of Wright's interest in the
well), the terms of the ``farm out'' were in accordance with
industry custom and the price was at or near market value. Thus
there was no gift to Wright; nor can either the repurchase or the
``farm out,'' which both took place in 1984, reasonably be viewed
as compenation to Wright for his efforts on Neptune's behalf in
1979.
   As discussed in full in Section III. A. of this Report, Wright's
receipt of the gift in excess of $100 from Moncrief violates House
Rule XLIII, clauses 1 and 4; and consideration 5 of the Code of
Ethics for Government Service. His failure to disclose the gift
violates House Rule XLIV.

<NOTE>B. Wright's Efforts on Behalf of Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corporation</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In September 1979, Wright co-signed a letter to Secretary of the
Interior, Cecil D. Andrus, on behalf of Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corporation
(``TXO''). The letter provided Andrus with background information
on TXO and its dispute with the Arkla Exploration Company over
mineral exploration leases on land in Arkansas.
   Wright held no interest in TXO at any relevant time. As
discussed in Section III. A. of this Report, from February 1979
until March 1984 Wright held an interest in the Whatley well, an
east-Texas natural gas well drilled and operated by TXO. However,
as an investor in the well, Wright's financial return was
determined only by the productivity of the well and could not have
been affected by TXO's success or failure with respect to the
Arkansas leases. Wright's letter did not comment upon the merits of
the dispute between TXO and Arkla. Therefore, it is not a
prohibited ex parte communication under the Government in the
Sunshine Act, Pub. L. 94-409, 4, Stat. 1241, 1246, 5 U.S.C. 557(d).
   The letter was the only communication on the subject between
Wright or his staff and Andrus or his staff. Therefore, the letter
was not an exercise of undue influence by Wright. Furthermore,
Andrus and undersecretary James A. Joseph both stated that the
letter made no demand or request that they deemed unusual or
improper. Nor did the letter affect the decision made by the
department with respect to the leases.
   As discussed in full in Section III. B. of this Report, Wright's
communication with the Secretary of the Interior on behalf of TXO
violated no law or standard of conduct.

<NOTE>C. Wright's Publication and Marketing of ``Reflections of a Public</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Man''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In early 1984, Wright and his close friend William Carlos Moore
discussed producing a book of Wright's earlier speeches, poems and
writings which Wright and Moore testified would be sold at low cost
to a very broad audience including college students and ``average
citizens.'' Wright told the Committee he wanted to give people an
idea of what his personal feelings were on a number of subjects so
that they could get to know the Majority Leader and next Speaker of
the House.
   Wright also discussed the book with his staff. Matthew
Cossolotto, Wright's congressional staff researcher and speech
writer, testified that Wright first raised the subject of the book
at a staff breakfast in February 1984. Wright asked the staff to
think about ways to market the book and suggested that when he gave
a speech to a trade association or other group, he could sell the
group books instead of taking an honorarium. Cossolotto testified
that Wright explained to the staff that unlike honoraria, book
royalties are exempt from the 30 percent maximum limit on outside
earned income.
   Throughout 1984, Wright had members of his staff collecting his
old speeches and compiling, editing, typing and proofreading the
manuscript for his book. Wright's staff obtained celebrity
endorsements of the book for the back cover and selected a
photograph of Wright for the front cover.
   Carlos Moore formed the Madison Publishing company in 1984 as a
division of Madison Systems Corporation, Moore's political
consulting firm, for the purpose of publishing Wright's book,
``Reflections of a Public Man.'' However, Madison Publishing did
not ``publish'' Wright's book. Nor has it published any other book.
   Madison Publishing designed the layout and printed the cover for
Wright's book. Moore sent the book itself to be printed and
assembled by The Printing Center in Fort Worth because, as he
testified, Madison Publishing did not have the capacity to print
20,000 copies. The Printing Center actually printed 19,068 books
and reduced the charge to Madison Publishing accordingly. The final
product was completed in early December 1984 and delivered in two
installments on December 6 and 18, 1984.
   Wright himself applied for and secured copyright protection for
the book and hired a Fort Worth real estate attorney to draft a
``royalty'' agreement between Wright and Madison Publishing
Company. Wright supplied the attorney with specific provisions to
be included in the agreement including the provisions for a 55
percent ``royalty.'' The agreement was executed on December 12,
1984, after 2,160 copies of the completed books had already been
delivered to Moore.

   Public airing of the ethics committee report
on House Speaker Jim Wright provides his opponents with reams of
political ammunition, but does not in itself strike a fatal blow.
   Democrats must move to quickly mold public opinion if the
speaker is going to keep his leadership post, and Wright's allies
say having the facts on the table can help.
   The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct released a
voluminous report by its special counsel and charged the speaker
with 69 instances of violating House rules.
   The report provides sometimes embarrassing details of the
financial benefits he received from friendships with two Fort Worth
businessmen.
   One, Carlos Moore, gave Wright unusually high royalties he
published the speaker's book, ``Reflections of a Public Man.'' With
fifty-five cents of every dollar going to Wright, the committee
said it appeared that the speaker was using bulk sales of the
paperback to evade House limits on outside income from speeches.
   The second friend, George Mallick, had a business partnership
with the speaker. Wright and his wife, Betty, benefited from the
free use of a condominium and a car, and an $18,000 annual salary
to Mrs. Wright.
   House members are looking at the committee report on two
political levels: within the institution and in their home
districts.
   Within the House, release of the report Monday caused members to
begin focusing on their own situations.
   ``We have to deal with it on a very specific level,'' said
Martin Frost, D-Texas, a Wright ally who contends lawmakers will
make independent judgments despite pressure at home. ``I think
members don't want to be stampeded on this, one way or another,''
he said.
   Frost said members confronted with the committee's findings will
find them troubling because of their broad implications. For
example, it decided that Mallick had an interest in legislation
using a standard so broad that anyone with wealth would fall in the
same category, he contended, a situation that could snare many
lawmakers.
   ``I think members will look at this in a serious way and say,
`Is this fair?''' he said.
   Outside of the House, Democrats must persuade the public that
the violations Wright is accused of are mostly technical and not
really unethical. They can't afford to wait for the committee to
render a verdict on whether Wright should be found guilty and
punished.
   The initial rush of publicity was seen by virtually everyone as
negative for Wright, but Democratic leaders argued that as they
rebut the specific charges the public will come to believe that
Wright is being held to an unjust standard.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said that ``once people clearly
understand ... then you get an entirely different feel and
reaction.''
   Wright himself must also be convincing.
   ``If the speaker is well received in the country, and what he
says is resonant with the American public, he improves his
chances,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.
   Further, the report itself is not a conviction. That could only
be done by the full House and even if that were to occur, it would
be up to the Democrats who elected him to decide whether Wright has
become an unsupportable political liability.
   With few exceptions, Republicans greeted the release with sounds
of deference and respect to the process set up to investigate a
fellow member. Despite the fact that the campaign to investigate
Wright's finances was kicked off by one of their own, Rep. Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, the Republicans tried to portray themselves as
above the fray.
   A key element in their strategy to wrest control of the House
away from the Democrats is to portray the Democrats as the party of
corruption and themselves as its enemy.
   ``The best politics for Republicans is no evidence of politics
at all,'' said Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, chairman of the
House Republican Conference.
   Some Democrats scoffed at the GOP tactic.
   It was ``bipartisan, non-partisan garbage,'' said Rep. James
Traficant, D-Ohio. ``Let there be no mistake, today in Washington,
D.C. the party lines are being drawn in indelible ink.''
   The verdict on Wright from the ethics committee may be technical
and not so clear as the party lines. But when that comes, some
weeks down the road, the public verdict may have already come in.
   ``We'll be opening our own mail for a while,'' said Rep. Pat
Williams, D-Mont.

<HEAD>Walesa Calls for Rebuilding Newly Legalized Solidarity</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with Walesa comments on Bush, arrival

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa on Monday urged Poles to
rebuild Solidarity ``skillfully and quickly'' hours after a court
declared the independent union legal again and ended seven years of
government suppression.
   Walesa also praised President Bush for announcing an aid package
for Poland's economy.
   Walesa was expected to follow up restoration of his union's
legal status with a meeting Tuesday with his longtime antagonist,
Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, and a trip to Rome on
Wednesday to meet Polish-born Pope John Paul II at the Vatican.
   Looking relaxed despite what he said was a case of pneumonia,
Walesa arrived by train in Warsaw on Monday night and told
reporters Bush was ``a brilliant politician.''
   ``Bush is a great man and he knows the Polish situation very
well,'' he said. He called the proposal for U.S. aid ``quite big.''
   Walesa was accompanied to Warsaw by key adviser Adam Michnik and
was welcomed at the station by a handful of other Solidarity
advisers.
   He said he could not confirm or deny he had a planned meeting
with Jaruzelski.
   ``I appeal to all workers and supporters of our union to form
factory organizations as soon as possible where they still don't
exist and to report their membership in Solidarity or to join it,''
said Walesa, in a statement read in Warsaw by union spokesman
Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
   Onyszkiewicz said an independent union press should begin
operating by the end of the month and that Solidarity should get
new national headquarters in Gdansk by Tuesday.
   ``Our effort, devotion and suffering have not been in vain,''
Walesa said in his statement. ``We defended our workers' rights,
together we are paving a road to a fully democratic and sovereign
Poland.''
   But he cautioned the ``day of success'' came in hard economic
times.
   ``The Polish nation is facing tasks which are much more complex
than in 1980. Now we must undertake a trial of real and deep
economic reform and democratic restructuring of the state,'' he
said.
   The Warsaw provincial court registered the reborn Solidarity in
the same room where its original charter was approved in November
1980.
   Onyszkiewicz said Walesa stayed away from the hearing in part
because the union always regarded itself as legal, so the session
had ``a technical rather than symbolic nature.''
   Nevertheless, there was thunderous applause when the verdict was
complete, sealing an about-face approved earlier by Communist Party
leaders.
   As the court session ended, hundreds of hands lifted in the
``V'' for victory sign and chants of ``Solidarnosc! Solidarnosc!''
filled the room. Solidarity leaders beamed, supporters waved
bouquets of yellow daffodils, and judges shook hands with the
participants.
   Then there were cheers of ``Lech Walesa! Lech Walesa!'' and the
singing of the national anthem.
   ``The spirit of history was with us,'' said Solidarity supporter
Krzysztof Sliwinski.
   Two Solidarity banners were held aloft during the hearing before
Presiding Judge Danuta Widawska and two other judges. About a dozen
Solidarity leaders and advisers and 300 sympathizers jammed the
narrow courtroom with yellow walls and crimson curtains. Another
100 waited in the corridor.
   ``Polish society puts enormous hopes in the honest operation of
all trade unions in the area of the rights and interests of the
working people and the realization of their material and cultural
needs,'' Ms. Widawska said after the verdict, in which she
registered Solidarity as a legal trade union.
   Jaruzelski tried to dissolve Solidarity in a December 1981
martial-law crackdown, but now seeks the movement's help to pull
Poland out of economic crisis.
   Party and government officials also admit that by legalizing the
union they hope to encourage the West to provide economic help to
Poland, burdened by a $38 billion foreign debt.
   President Bush on Monday announced an aid package to help
Poland's economy. He told a Polish-American crowd in Hamtramck,
Mich., that continued aid would depend on consistent moves by the
communist government toward reform.
   The concessions could open the way for up to $1 billion in new
loans, loan rescheduling and trade and investment relief, according
to administration and international monetary sources.
   The last step in the long bid for restoration of Solidarity
followed unprecedented negotiations between communist authorities
and opposition representatives led by Walesa.
   The talks reached accords on legalizing Solidarity, creating the
first freely elected legislative chamber in the Soviet bloc and
other economic and political reforms.
   Solidarity members, who predict the union will grow to 5 million
to 7 million members and hold its first congress later this year,
face the tasks of organizing the union and the election campaign.
   The movement was 10 million strong and so popular it threatened
to topple the communists' monopoly on power when martial law was
imposed.
   Although thousands of its activists including Walesa were locked
up, the union continued to function _ first as an underground
organization staging rallies and putting out clandestine
newspapers, and then more openly in factories and offices after a
1986 political amnesty.

<HEAD>WASHN: to Moore.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The agreement provided that Wright would receive $3.25 (nearly
55 percent) of the $5.95 list price on all retail sales of the
book. Moore would receive $2.70 from which he would pay all
printing and marketing expenses. Such ``royalty'' payments are
unheard of in the publishing industry. In fact, Wright's previous
royalty contracts with three major publishers provided for standard
industry royalties ranging from 10 percent to 15 percent, depending
upon sales. Morton Janklow, an expert on the publishing industry,
testified that no rational publisher would agree to a 55 percent
royalty on list price because it could not make a profit. Janklow
also testified that in his opinion as literary agent for Nancy
Reagan, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, Helmut Schmidt, Sidney Sheldon and
Danielle Steele, Wright's book was not commercially publishable.
   Although the agreement also provided that Madison Publishing
would publish and market the book, in fact, Wright and his staff
provided many of the ordinary services of a publisher and made the
most significant contribution to marketing efforts. ...
   In this instance, Moore designed the layout and printed the
cover of the book. He hired others to typeset and print the book
itself. All other aspects of book production were performed by
Wright or his staff. Moore also sent out 300 to 500 letters
soliciting orders for the book and employed 12 to 15 people for
four hours a day during one week to make telephone solicitations
from voter registration lists. Moore arranged an autograph party,
one or two newspaper advertisements and an appearance by Wright on
the Larry King Show. Moore's marketing efforts resulted in precious
few sales to ``average citizens.'' In fact, Moore testified that he
never intended to sell the book to bookstores where average people
could buy them because bookstores would only purchase at the
discount price of $3.00 per copy. ``That doesn't leave you much
room.''
   The real focus of the marketing effort for ``Reflections of a
Public Man'' was on bulk sales to trade associations and other
groups. Almost 98 percent of all sales of ``Reflections of a Public
Man'' were bulk sales of 15 or more books. In some instances,
Wright's staff informed various groups Wright spoke to that because
he had already reached the maximum limit on outside earned income
for that year, he would not be able to keep an honoraium offered to
him. The staff then recommended that instead of paying Wright an
honorarium, the organization could purchase books for the same
amount.
   For example, Wright gave a lecture in October 1984 at Southwest
Texas State University. The University paid Wright an honorarium of
$3,000 in addition to his expenses, but was subsequently informed
by Wright's staff that he would be unable to accept the honorarium.
Wright's staff suggested that the University purchase 504 books for
$3,000 in lieu of the honorarium. The University purchased the
books and distributed most of them to students in its political
science department. Wright endorsed the $3,000 check over to
Madison Publishing Company. Despite the change in the nature of the
transaction, the University's records plainly list the $3,000
expenditure as an honorarium for Wright's appearance. Instead of
passing up $3,000 or donating it to charity, Wright thus received a
$1,650 ``royalty'' for his lecture at the University.
   Wright also spoke at a Satellite Broadcasting and Communications
Association (``SBCA'') trade show in September 1985 just several
weeks after SBCA had purchased 1,680 copies of ``Reflections of a
Public Man'' for $10,000. SBCA testified that although it
historically has paid honoraria and expenses to congressmen for
their appearances, in this case SBCA's legal counsel, who arranged
for Wright to speak at the trade show, suggested that SBCA purchase
the books instead. Thus Wright received a $5,500 ``royalty'' for
his appearance before the SBCA.
   Not all bulk sales were in lieu of honoraria. For example,
Carlos Moore arranged a sale of 2,000 books to the Teamsters for
$12,200 paid out of the DRIVE Political Fund. The books were
distributed to Teamster members. Wright had not spoken at any
Teamster event.
   In addition, S. Gene Payte, a Fort Worth real estate developer,
testified that he wanted to give Wright a $5,000 gift and, in fact,
had given a $5,000 check to Betty Wright. Wright subsequently
informed him that he could not accept the gift and returned the
check to Payte. Payte continued to search for a way to give cash to
Wright and shortly after receiving the first check back from
Wright, wrote a second $5,000 check, this time to Madison Systems
for ``revision and distribution of Wright's books.'' Payte
testified that he expected to receive 1,000 copies of the revised
edition of the book and, in fact, he made a second payment of
$1,000 when he realized that $5,000 would not buy 1,000 copies of
the $5.95 book. However, the book was never revised. Payte
testified he received approximately 300 to 500 copies of the old
book instead. No further accounting was made.

<HEAD>Former Hostage Accuses Britain of Weakness</HEAD>

   Former hostage John-Paul Kauffmann on Monday urged
Britain to follow the example set by France and West Germany and
negotiate the release of its citizens held captive in Lebanon.
   Kauffmann said Britain ``has abandoned'' John McCarthy, 32, a
television reporter abducted on his way to Beirut airport.
   ``British officials say they won't negotiate because it will
only lead to the taking of other hostages,'' Kauffmann told a
meeting to mark the third anniversary of McCarthy's kidnapping. ``I
say you can negotiate without giving in.''
   The French and West German governments managed to secure the
release of their hostages without being brought to their knees,
Kauffmann said at the meeting organized by British and French
journalists.
   Kauffmann, a magazine writer and French citizen, was freed in
May 1988 after more than three years' captivity.
   France, which was under constant pressure to get back its
hostages, has denied paying ransom. It complied with several
Iranian demands, including banishing the main Iranian opposition
group from Paris.
   Kauffmann said he recently helped mark the start of the fifth
anniversary in captivity of Terry Anderson, 42, the chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press and the longest held of
15 Western hostages in Lebanon. Anderson was abducted March 16,
1985.
   ``There's something cruel in these anniversaries,'' Kauffman
said.
   Those at Monday's meeting at UNESCO headquarters issued an
appeal to all with influence ``to do whatever they can immediately
to help secure their release.''
   Organizer Anthony Brock, a British writer, said the appeal would
be sent to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and the
Iranian and Syrian embassies in Paris.
   Iran influences Moslem extremists holding the hostages, while
Syria is the main foreign power broker in Lebanon.
   A group working for McCarthy's release ran cinema, television
and newspaper advertisements Monday.
   One asked moviegoers in Britain to close their eyes and think of
England, because McCarthy has ``done nothing else for the last
three years.''
   In a message with Arabic voice-over on Lebanese television, the
hostage's father, Pat, told his son, ``Whatever you do, old chap,
keep your spirits up.''
   Similar messages were published in the Beirut daily As-Safir.
Another message in the newspaper, signed ``Jill'' and apparently
from McCarthy's girlfriend, Jill Morell, said: ``I wish more than
anything that you could be back home with us. But until then, I'm
sending you all my special love.''
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by
pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ McCarthy, Anglican envoy
Terry Waite and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dual
British and Irish nationality whose release is also sought by the
Irish government.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the Senate opened debate Monday on
President Bush's slightly altered plan for bailing out savings and
loan depositors, Republicans blamed House Democrats for the bulk of
costs.
   ``There's enough blame to go around, but if you want to single
out one culprit, it's the House of Representatives,'' said Sen.
Jake Garn of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking
Committee.
   Garn said the bailout costs _ estimated at a minimum of $157
billion over the next 10 years _ would be only half as much if in
1986, the Democratic-controlled House had gone along with a
Senate-approved measure to pump $15 billion into the S&amp;L insurance
funds to close insolvent thrifts then.
   ``The kindest thing I can say about the House is only that it is
totally irresponsible,'' Garn said, referring to action last week
by a House subcommittee that would require S&amp;L owners to put up
less of their own money to stay in business.
   Former S&amp;L regulators have blamed Democratic House Speaker Jim
Wright of Texas for stalling the 1986 legislation on behalf of
thrift operators in his state.
   The House Ethics Committee on Monday cleared Wright of charges
he improperly intervened with S&amp;L regulators but concluded that
there is ``reason to believe'' Wright violated official rules of
conduct 69 times by not disclosing thousands of dollars in alleged
gifts.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Don Riegle, D-Mich., said
state chartered thrifts in Texas and California accounted for 70
percent of the $38 billion the government committed last year to
resolve thrift problems.
   ``I don't think we can let irresponsible state legislatures hold
the key to federal deposit insurance funds,'' he said, referring to
changes his committee made in Bush's plan to put more restrictions
on state-chartered S&amp;Ls.
   Riegle said the legislation ``breaks up the close relationship
between the thrift industry and its regulators'' while assuring the
survival of most S&amp;Ls as the originator of half of the nation's
home mortgages.
   But he said ``there is no certain guarantee that this plan or
any plan will work as intended'' and conceded that taxpayers may be
asked again in the future to come up with more money.
   ``We can say that this package is the soundest and the toughest
we could put together within the time bounds given us,'' he said,
referring to the seven weeks since the package was put forth by the
White House.
   Both Riegle and Garn, as well as other members from both parties
on the banking committee, pleaded with their colleagues to forego
offering amendments to the 564-page bill.
   ``We may have a long fight ahead with the House,'' Garn said.
``Extraneous and controversial amendments would upset the delicate
balance we've reached.''
   However, several amendments were in the works, according to
Senate aides, although none were offered or voted on Monday.
   Among them was one by Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., that would
stretch out to June 1994, Bush's June 1991 deadline for small S&amp;L
operators with loans of less than $100 million to effectively
double the amount of their own money at risk.
   Pressler complained the bill provides ``a heavy advantage toward
larger institutions'' by allowing them to stretch out to as long as
25 years good-will exemptions from the capital requirements.
   A spokeswoman for Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said he is
considering proposing a variety of pro-consumer amendments .
   Other possible amendments include:
   _Reinstating a funding plan authored by Riegle, who claims it
would save $150 million a year. Riegle effectively abandoned the
plan last week under a veto threat by Bush but Majority Leader
George Mitchell said he assumes it will consume ``considerable
debate'' over the next two days.
   _Giving non-profit groups and local housing agencies a 90-day
right of first refusal to purchase at ``appraised market prices''
residential property that has fallen into the government's hand
through loan defaults to insolvent S&amp;Ls. The amendment by Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass., was defeated in the Banking Committee, where it was
criticized by Sen. Phil Gramm, D-Texas, as ``social engineering.''
   Meanwhile, three consumers groups _ the Consumer Federation of
America, Consumers Union and Association of Community Organizations
for Reform Now _ on Monday criticized both the Senate and House
versions of the S&amp;L bill.
   ``Last week the banking committees led us down a primrose path
that threatens to end in another nightmare of S&amp;L insolvencies and
enormous public debt,'' said Peggy Miller, a CFA lobbyist. ``What
you have to concentrate on is the loopholes, because they're broad
... and easily used.''

<HEAD>New Report Sees Unfair Trade Barriers by Japanese</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oregon lawmakers said Monday that a draft
Commerce Department report on Japanese barriers to imports of
American wood products should bolster the case for U.S. sanctions.
   The draft report, obtained Monday, says Japan uses unfair trade
practices, including high tariffs, subisidies and even building
codes that require the use of nails that can crack American
plywood, to protect their mills from U.S. imports.
   The report said Japanese tariffs and other barriers were
designed to bolster imports of raw logs and discourage imports of
finished products.
   Despite earlier progress in opening some parts of the Japanese
market, the report said barriers remain which impede U.S. imports,
and it said the government of Japan has refused to enter into a new
round of talks.
   The report said ``it is unlikely that any further concessions
will be forthcoming unless additional U.S. efforts are made. Such
concessions would only be obtained if there were a clear incentive
or at the least inclusion of these barriers in the high priority of
issues to be resolved by the U.S. and Japanese governments.''
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., who requested the study more than a
year ago, said it should bolster the case for imposing trade
sanctions against Japan unless the barriers are removed.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who had earlier called for sanctions,
said in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills the
report ``strongly supports'' a need for aggressive action by the
administration.
   Last month, the National Forest Products Association asked Hills
to rule the Japanese were engaging in unfair trade practices
involving forest products and, if negotiations failed to resolve
the dispute after 18 months, to impose sanctions.
   The association has estimated that exports of finished U.S.
forest products to Japan could increase $1.2 billion annually if
the barriers were lifted.

   Criticism grew of how police handled
the stadium crush that killed 94 soccer fans, and the government
said Monday it may ban standing-room-only sections like the one
where the tragedy occurred.
   Officials and fans accused South Yorkshire police of letting
thousands of late arrivals into Hillsborough stadium, then reacting
too slowly when the surging crowd crushed people against a steel
anti-riot fence in one of the concrete terrace areas packed with
standees.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, speaking to a hushed House of
Commons, said an investigative panel led by Lord Justice Taylor
would begin work Tuesday and ``make recommendations about the needs
of crowd control and safety at sports grounds.''
   ``We have to set our sights high and find a better way for
British football (soccer),'' Hurd said. ``We owe a duty to these
passionate supporters of football to examine urgently and
thoroughly the causes and background and to do all in our power to
prevent such a thing happening again.''
   Hurd told the Commons the decision of a senior police officer to
open the gate because he ``considered that there was a possible
danger to the lives of the spectators at the front'' would be a
central question for investigators. Survivors said about 4,000 fans
were pushing at turnstiles to get inside.
   Hillsborough gatekeeper Jack Stone told the Sheffield Star he
refused police orders to open the outer gate and was forced to hand
over his keys to a police inspector.
   ``I handed the keys to him and told him it was his
responsibility and not mine,'' Stone was quoted as saying.
   Liverpool fan Stephen Mitton, who was caught in the crush
outside the gate, told BBC-TV:
   ``The steward put his hand on the gate and said, `Don't open
it.' The police said, `Open the gate. There's going to be a crush.'
Then two police officers opened the gate.''
   The crush was so great, Mitton said, that fans fell on the floor
and people climbed over them. ``All the police were doing was
standing up saying `Get back, get back.' There was already people
dead then. I climbed on them to get over the fence.''
   The Sheffield Star said a police superintendent made the
decision to open the 16-foot-wide gate because he feared a wall was
seconds away from collapsing on hundreds of fans.
   ``Startled officers _ some of them hemmed in _ thought the wall
was beginning to buckle under the enormous pressure of screaming
fans. The crowd was packed so tightly around a police horse that it
was lifted six inches off the ground,'' the paper said.
   South Yorkshire police, who have handed over a separate
investigation of the policing of the match to the neighboring West
Midlands police force, refused to comment on the Sheffield Star
report.
   Police Federation representative Paul Middup attacked growing
public criticism of police actions as ``grossly unfair,'' saying
they faced a situation ``for which no amount of training could
prepare them.''
   Police on Monday released the names of the 94 victims. All were
British, 34 were teen-agers, 33 were in their 20s, and seven were
women.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said as many
as 40 who perished are thought to have died in the rush through a
tunnel to the center terrace at the Liverpool goal. The rest were
crushed against the 10-foot fence in front of the terrace or were
trampled underfoot, it said.
   They ranged in age from 10 to 67. Of the 170 injured, 47
remained hospitalized Monday, including 17 in intensive care.
   Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, and his wife, Diana,
visited some of the hospitalized fans, as did Liverpool soccer team
members, who came with team scarves and souvenirs.
   In Liverpool, where most victims lived, the city council Monday
called an official week of mourning and discussed ways of helping
the bereaved and injured.
   In the House of Commons, Hurd said the government believes the
future of soccer lies ``in providing all-seated accommodation at
major football clubs.''
   Most British soccer stadiums have seats and standing-room-only
terraces, which are cheaper and generally favored by young fans.
   Hurd said Justice Taylor would also review the fencing in soccer
stadiums, which has been required in many areas to prevent fan
violence.
   Several soccer clubs, including Liverpool, announced Monday they
were preparing to tear down their fences without waiting for the
government to act
   Hurd told the Commons the government also planned to go ahead
with legislation requiring all fans attending soccer matches to
have identity cards issued by the teams. This was a key part of the
government's plans to crack down on soccer hooliganism.
   Club officials and fans have objected to the proposal as too
expensive and a logistical nightmare. Opposition lawmakers urged
the government to delay the identity card bill until Taylor's
report was completed.
   ``For God's sake, do not let our people be trapped like animals
again,'' said Eric Heffer, a Labor Party lawmaker from Liverpool,
who also urged the government to take some immediate steps to
improve the safety of stadiums.
   Messages of condolence continued to arrive, including one from
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who said: ``Life indeed
brings unexpected tragic situations, both in our and in your
countries.''

<HEAD>WASHN: committee statement.</HEAD>
<HEAD>COMMITTEE ACTION TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH ITEM NO. 1</HEAD>
<HEAD>OF THE RESOLUTION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The first area addressed in the Preliminary Inquiry concerns:
   The circumstances surrounding lobbying efforts on behalf of a
constituent with whom he (Representative Wright) had an interest in
a private gas well venture.
   Special Outside Counsel reported that, beginning in late 1978,
Representative Wright intervened with the U.S. Department of State
and the Egyptian government on behalf of the Neptune Oil Company
(Neptune) in order to secure for Neptune an opportunity to resolve
a dispute with Egypt over the right to explore, develop, and
operate offshore oil fields in the Gulf of Suez. Neptune had a
contract with the State of Israel to explore and develop the
Israeli-occupied territory. However, as a result of the Camp David
accords in September of 1978 and the subsequent peace treaty
negotiations, Israel was required to return the occupied Sinai and
Gulf of Suez territory to Egypt, relinquishing all rights to the
oil fields without compensation. Egypt would not recognize
Neptune's rights under the Israeli contract. Thus Neptune stood to
lose its investment and expected profit from the operation of the
oil fields.
   Representative Wright introduced Richard Moncrief and other
Neptune principals to State Department officials, contacted
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Egyptian Ambassador Ashraf
Ghorbal, and personally delivered a letter dated March 27, 1979, to
Egyptian President Anwar Al-Sadat while he was in Washington
seeking President Sadat's consideraton of Neptune's plight. In
counsel's view, Representative Wright's intervention on behalf of
Neptune Oil did not in itself appear to have violated any law or
ethical standard.
   During the period Representative Wright intervened on Neptune's
behalf, he also accepted the opportunity to purchase a percentage
of the Moncrief family's interest in two east-Texas gas wells
offered by W. A. ``Monty'' Moncrief, the late patriarch of the
Moncrief family who was for many years active in Washington, D.C.,
as a lobbyist for the Independent Petroleum Association. The first
opportunity, the Whatley Well No. 1, located in Freestone County,
Texas, appears to have been an ordinary, business transaction. ...
   The record establishes that Representative Wright risked the
amount of his share of the drilling costs against the chance that
the well would be dry. Had the well been dry, Representative
Wright's investment would have been lost.
   Once gas was discovered in the Whatley well, although it was
commercially productive, it was clear that production and,
therefore, profit from the well, would be substantially less than
had been anticipated. Consequently, in 1984, at a time when the
Whatley well was ``shut in,'' i.e., had temporarily ceased
production, Representative Wright asked Monty Moncrief to buy back
his interest in the well. ...
   Monty Moncrief agreed to buy back Representative Wright's
Whatley interest for $20,000. While Moncrief's repurchase of
Representative Wright's interest in the Whatley well appears to
have been a favor to Representative Wright, it also appears to have
been purchased at about the market value of the interest.
Therefore, counsel concluded that there was no gift to
Representative Wright.
   The committee concurred with counsel's findings. Accordingly,
Item No. 1 in the committee's Resolution of Preliminary Inquiry, to
the extent that it was predicated on Representative Wright's
interest in the Whatley well, does not warrant further action by
the committee. ...
   However, in the course of pursuing the circumstances surrounding
Representative Wright's interest in the Whatley well, the Special
Outside Counsel identified a second well in which Representative
Wright had an interest which, in counsel's view, raised a question
of improper conduct. This matter concerned Representative Wright's
acquisition of an interest in the L. D. Williams No. 1 well.
   Counsel reported that during calendar year 1979, Representative
Wright acquired an interest in the L. D. Williams No. 1 well, the
opportunity to invest in such well also having been afforded to him
by the late W. A. ``Monty'' Moncrief, an individual having a direct
interest in legislation. Representative Wright purchased his
interest by check dated October 11, 1979, in response to a bill
from the Moncriefs dated August 20, 1979, for $29,036.91 (with
approximately $50,000 having been paid in total) _ the pre-drilling
completion cost to invest _ but after the well had been drilled and
determined to be a successful venture on June 27, 1979. Since, at
the time of his purchase, Representative Wright's share was valued
at approximately $132,000-140,000, Counsel believed the congressman
received a gift of approximately $82,000-90,000 from Mr. Moncrief
in reduced purchase cost. Moreover, during the period immediately
prior to when Representative Wright acquired this interest, counsel
noted he had actively intervened on behalf of the Moncrief family
with respect to capital investments the family had in the Sinai
Peninsula.

<TEXT>
   Residents sought shelter Monday in
basements and bunkers during citywide shelling that killed at least
45 people in three days and touched off international appeals for a
cease-fire.
   The rocket and artillery barrages slammed into both the
Christian and Moslem sectors during intensified fighting in and
around Beirut between Christian army units and an alliance of Druse
militiamen and Syrian troops.
   The dead included Spain's ambassador to Lebanon, Pedro Manuel De
Aristegui, and his father-in-law, prominent Lebanese poet Tewfic
Youssef Awwad. Warrant Officer Youssef Bitar, the Lebanese army's
top explosives specialist, said on Christian-controlled Voice of
Lebanon radio the ambassador's residence was hit by a Syrian shell.
   Police also said 175 people were wounded in renewed bombardments
that broke out late Saturday.
   Police put the toll in 41 days of fighting at 262 killed and 932
wounded. The overwhelming majority of the victims have been
civilians.
   Tens of thousands of Beirut residents had hardly emerged from
their shelters Monday morning during a brief lull when guns and
rocket launchers thundered back into action, sending them back
underground. Many were trapped without water or electricity.
   Smoldering cars lay charred Monday in streets littered with
glass shards and severed power cables. Hundreds of fashionable
boutiques were gutted.
   Many buildings burned down because firefighters had no water.
   Only a few bakeries opened Monday morning, but there was not
enough bread to go around.
   ``Please, please. I need five loaves. I have five children that
I have to feed,'' shouted housewife Amina Shehab outside a bakery
in Moslem west Beirut.
   The baker yelled back: ``I've less than three dozen loaves, and
there are many other people who want to eat as well. I can only
give you two loaves.''
   ``Lebanon's apocalypse persists,'' Beirut's independent daily
An-Nahar said in a front-page editorial Monday.
   The prime minister of the Moslem Cabinet in the split
government, Salim Hoss, said Monday he reached agreement with
French Humanitarian Assistance Minister Bernard Kouchner to
evacuate more wounded civilians.
   A source close to Hoss later said Moslem victims of the fighting
would be evacuated to a French hospital ship on Tuesday if security
conditions permit.
   Fourteen Christian victims were ferried to a French boat from
the Christian port of Jounieh on Friday.
   The United States, Kuwait, Jordan, Pope John Paul II appealed
for an end to the confrontation, which has developed into one of
the bloodiest rounds of the 14-year-old civil war.
   Pope John Paul II urged the United Nations and Arab League
nations to use their influence to bring about an immediate
cease-fire.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said, ``All parties, including Syria, which is a direct participant
in the artillery exchanges ... must stop the fighting.''
   Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah Ahmed Sabah, called for
an emergency Arab League council meeting.
   The battles began after Gen. Michel Aoun, the head of the
Christian Cabinet, ordered his forces to blockade several ports
controlled by Moslem militiamen. Syria rallied to the militiamens'
aid, and Aoun pledged to expel the estimated 40,000 Syrian troops
from Lebanon.
   The Arab League invited Syria to send in its forces as
peacekeepers in 1976.
   Aoun, in an interview released Monday, accused the United States
of covering up for Syrian attacks in Lebanon.
   ``The United States is undoubtedly trying to solve the
Palestinian-Israeli or the Arab-Israeli problem at Lebanon's
expense and is thus sponsoring this dirty Syrian role in Lebanon,''
he was quoted as saying by the London-based newsletter Middle East
Mirror. Text of the interview was sent by telex to The Associated
Press in Bahrain.
   Aoun said U.S. officials were trying to portray Lebanese strife
as a problem between Moslems and Christians, but he said it is
caused by occupation by Syrian and Israeli forces, according to the
interview.
   Israel occupies a self-proclaimed ``security zone'' up to 10
miles deep in south Lebanon.

   In counsel's view, Representative Wright's actions on behalf of
the Moncrief family at a time when he acquired an interest in the
L. D. Williams No. 1 well below its fair market value, represented
a violation of Consideration No. 5 of the Code of Ethics for
Government Service, which states, in part, that any person in
government service should ``never accept for himself or his family,
favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by
reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his
governmental duties.'' The Special Outside Counsel also indicated
that such a violation also represents action which does not reflect
creditably on the House of Representatives in violation of House
Rule XLIII, clause 1.
   Finally, because Representative Wright did not report as a gift
the below-market purchase of his L. D. Williams No. 1 well interest
on his financial disclosure statement for calendar year 1979,
coupled with the fact that this gift was worth more than $100,
counsel believed that Representative Wright violated House Rule
XLIV _ reporting receipt of gift, and House Rule XLIII, clause 4,
which imposes a limit of $100 on gifts received from persons having
a direct interest in legislation.
   The committee did not concur with the Special Outside Counsel.
This conclusion rested on five grounds. First, the absence of any
formal communication between Representative Wright and Monty
Moncrief or the Moncrief oil organization indicating the
congressman's commitment to acquire an interest in the L. D.
Williams No. 1 well did not, in and of itself, support a conclusion
that there had been no agreement for Representative Wright to
acquire his interest prior to the successful completion of the well
in June, 1979. In this connection, the committee believes it is
reasonable to infer that, Representative Wright established his
good faith in entering into a business transaction with the
Moncriefs in connection with the Whatley well.
   Second, it appears that Representative Wright's transaction with
the Moncriefs was handled no differently than the purchase of an
interest in the same well by Monty Moncrief's grandchildren.
Specifically, the Moncrief grandchildren also purchased their
interest in the well, through a trust agreement, at the same time
Representative Wright acquired his interest. All of these
transactions occurred subsequent to the successful completion of
the well.
   Third, Representative Wright's October 4, 1979, loan transaction
with Continental National Bank to obtain the funds ($35,000)
required to defray the cost of his acquisition in the well occurred
a short time after his receipt of a bill from the Moncriefs for his
share of drilling costs. In this regard, the committee believes it
is reasonable that the congressman delayed his loan transaction to
avoid paying interest on the funds until there was a need for him
to meet his financial obligations arising out of the purchase. ...
   Fourth, the original correspondence from Monty Moncrief to
Representative Wright dated February 22, 1979, clearly indicated
the possibility that the congressman might be interested in one or
two oil and gas ventures _ which later resulted in his acquisition
of interests in the Whatley No. 1 well and the L. D. Williams No. 1
well. The fact that an ambiguity arises by virtue of Representative
Wright's February 26, 1979, letter in response to the earlier
(February 22, 1979) correspondence from Monty Moncrief _ wherein
the congressman indicated his interest in participating in one
venture _ was not viewed as supporting the conclusion that
Representative Wright intended to purchase an interest in only one
well. Accordingly, the ambiguity in the correspondence was resolved
in favor of Representative Wright.
   Finally, Representative Wright's financial disclosure statement
for calendar year 1979 indicated that the interest was acquired in
April of that year.
   In the light of the foregoing, the committee did not conclude
that there was a reason to believe that Representative Wright
violated any controlling standards of conduct in connection with
his purchase of an interest in the L. D. Williams No. 1.

   A helicopter swooped into a prison's high-security
exercise yard Monday and a convicted drug kingpin jumped aboard,
but the chopper caught a fence and crashed in the yard, injuring
the would-be escapee and his pilot.
   Benjamin ``Barry'' Kramer, 36, a former powerboat champion
serving life without parole as the leader of a
marijuana-trafficking ring, broke his right leg in the accident.
The pilot suffered two broken legs and facial injuries.
   ``Kramer apparently was ready, and as soon as the helicopter was
there, he jumped right into it,'' said John Clark, warden at the
federal Metropolitan Correctional Center.
   Clark said three armed guards watched but did not react because
they did not want to shoot into the prison yard, where a half-dozen
men were exercising. He also said they feared there might be a
hostage in the helicopter.
   Most of MCC is medium-security, but Kramer and about 50 other
prisoners were being held in a special high-security area because
they were considered escape risks.
   The two-seater Bell helicopter, a type once flown for military
reconnaissance but now used mainly for aerial photography or
crop-spraying, flew into the prison just after 10 a.m., Clark said.
   It dropped low enough for Kramer to jump onto one landing skid,
and was beginning to rise when its tail rotor caught in barbed wire
atop the metal fence around the exercise area.
   Clark said at least one other prisoner may have tried to jump on
the helicopter, possibly destabilizing the small craft.
   The accident sent pieces of the rotor and the fence hurtling
hundreds of yards.
   ``It's lucky more people weren't hurt,'' Clark said.
   Prison guards immediately pulled Kramer and the pilot from the
wreckage and administered first aid before they were taken to a
hospital.
   Authorities identified the pilot as Charles Clayton Stevens, 34,
of Gold Beach, Ore.
   The Bell 47D-1 helicopter, built in 1952, was reported sold in
January to C. Stevens of Gold Beach, according to the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   Stevens, a sea urchin diver, worked with Sin Loi Commercial
Diving Co. in Gold Beach, according to a man who answered the phone
there. Stevens left town about a month ago, said the man, who
refused to give his name.
   An aviation official who spoke under condition of anonymity said
the helicopter was spotted last month on a truck near Tamiami
Airport, a few miles from the prison. The truck carried an Oregon
registration, the source said.
   But the copter apparently took off from Opa-locka Airport, about
25 miles north of the prison, the U.S. Marshal's office said.
   After the crash, all 1,000 inmates were locked down, and
officials began interviewing prisoners who were in the yard at the
time, Clark said.
   Prisoners, even in the highsecurity area, have phone privileges
and all calls are tape-recorded, he said. ``Obviously we will be
going back and checking the calls that Kramer made,'' Clark said.
   Kramer was convicted in Illinois, along with former car-racing
star Randy Lanier, on charges of running a multimillion-dollar
pot-smuggling ring. He was sentenced to life without parole.
   He was brought to MCC from a federal prison at Ray Brook, N.Y.,
in December to face another marijuana-smuggling indictment in Fort
Lauderdale and a Miami gun charge on which he already has been
convicted.
   U.S. Marshal John Horgan said Kramer will also be charged with
attempted escape, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in
prison, and the pilot will face charges of aiding an escape.
   According to the Fort Lauderdale drug racketeering indictment,
Kramer imported tons of marijuana to Florida and California, and
shifted millions of dollars between accounts in Lichtenstein and
the British Virgin Islands.
   Three years ago, another MCC inmate tried a helicopter escape.
Gary Betzner, who later testified about alleged guns-for-drugs
schemes to arm the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, arranged to hire a
helicopter that flew into the prison.
   But Betzner's contact was an undercover agent, and the
helicopter carried agents who arrested him when he ran to it.

<HEAD>Muscovite Fights Construction on Suspected Nuclear Dump Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former government employee went to court Monday
seeking to halt construction of apartments and an underground
garage on a site he claims was a nuclear dump.
   Oleg Lyanin said the site, along the Leninsky Prospekt
thoroughfare in south Moscow, was used to bury wastes from uranium
processing at the beginning of the Soviet nuclear effort in the
1940s.
   No official evidence has been released that the dump exists and
there is no evidence of nuclear leaks, the Moscow man said in a
telephone interview. But he claimed scientists involved in the
nuclear effort have pinpointed the spot and several others as the
sites of nuclear dumps.
   ``We're sure there's a map, perhaps several made at different
intervals of where and what is in Moscow,'' said Lyanin, a former
negotiator and translator for the Ministry of Foreign Trade.
   He said he filed his first court documents April 10 asking that
the case be turned over to prosecutors for investigation of
possible criminal charges. He said that request was granted three
days later.
   According to a law passed after the Chernobyl nuclear accident,
disturbing buried radioactive waste is punishable by up to 10 years
in prison, according to Lyanin.
   He said that in his court appearance Monday he asked the court
to halt construction of the garage and apartments to ``leave
trouble where it lies.''
   There has been much greater concern in the Soviet Union about
nuclear safety since the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in
April 1986. At least 31 people perished when a reactor exploded.
   The site for the garage and apartments in southern Moscow is
less than a half-mile from the Anglo-American School, whose 200
pupils include children of diplomats and business representatives
from the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries.
   The director of the Anglo-American School, Vera Nordal, said
Soviet officials have not contacted the school about the matter.
   She said British officials checked the area for radiation Monday
and tests conducted by the U.S. Embassy following the Chernobyl
accident did not turn up radiation near the school.
   Lyanin said the planned apartments would be occupied by members
of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Republic and officials
of the Central Council of Trade Unions.
   He said excavation for the $24 million project began recently
but has been halted pending a decision on his petitions in the
Dzerzhinsky region People's Court.
   Residents of the region have held several meetings to oppose the
construction project, according to Lyanin.

   A man was reported killed Monday during a
demonstration by several thousand supporters of the fundamentalist
National Islamic Front against the suspension of Islamic law in
Sudan.
   Spokesmen for the front identified the victim as Shayk Rayeh
Mahmoud, but did not give details or accuse anyone in his death.
   As they marched through central Khartoum, protesters chanted:
``There is no God but Allah! There is no alternative to Sharia
(Islamic law)! ''
   It was the fourth day of demonstrations, which began after
Parliament voted to postpone debate on Sharia, or Islamic law,
until a national constitutional conference convenes.
   The conference is to assemble all political forces, including
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, and one of its purposes
is to find a solution to the 6-year-old civil war in the south.
   Suspending Islamic law, which President Gaafar Nimeiri put into
effect two years before he was overthrown in 1985, has been a major
demand by the south. Most people there are Christians or animists,
while Khartoum and the rest of the north is overwhelmingly Moslem.
   Ali Osman Taha, the National Islamic Front's leader in
Parliament, told the marchers Monday: ``Demonstrations will
continue day and night until this government of traitors ...
non-believers is toppled.
   ``You have come out to tell them there are sharp swords ready to
defend the Sharia of Allah.''
   Riot police did not interfere, although the protests violate an
Interior Ministry ban on demonstrations.
   Interior Minister Mubarak Abdullah Fadil Mahdi said in a
statement later, however, that security forces would use force if
necessary to end unauthorized protests.
   Mahdi said two demonstrators were injured in addition to the one
killed, but did not elaborate.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House gave overwhelming approval Monday to
a measure that would repeal major portions of the Hatch Act and
allow federal Civil Service employees to participate in partisan
political activity on their own time.
   But despite the 297-90 House vote, final enactment into law is
far from certain.
   The House approved an almost identical bill last year, but it
died in the Senate.
   The administration is opposed to the bill and Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh has said he will recommend a veto should it reach
President Bush's desk.
   Nonetheless, the measure was pushed strongly by various unions
representing federal workers and their leaders were quick to praise
the House members who voted for it.
   ``This is not a political party issue ... it's a political
freedom issue,'' said Robert M. Tobias, president of the National
Treasury Employees Union. ``We urge the Senate to join the House in
standing firmly on the side of rights for federal workers.''
   However, Tobias' statement did not suggest there was anything
more than an ``excellent possibility'' the measure will pass the
Senate.
   The bill would:
   _Allow federal employees to run for partisan political office on
their own time, without taking a leave of absence unless
campaigning would interfere with performance of their duties.
   _Permit employees to request unpaid leave to run for office and
says leave must be granted unless the agency they work for
determines they cannot be spared.
   _Allow federal employees to manage political campaigns and raise
campaign money during off-duty hours.
   The measure would clarify and, in many cases, strengthen current
Hatch Act prohibitions against using a federal position for
political purposes.
   In a letter to Congress, Thornburgh said enactment of provisions
in the House will ``would lead to a tragic repoliticization of the
federal workforce.''
   Aside from concerns about specifics of the bill, wrote
Thornburgh, the overall effect on public perception of the fairness
of government dealing ``might well be devastaging.''
   ``For example, if it appears that a candidate of Party A has
misappropirated funds, it will not inspire confidence to learn that
the local U.S. attorney's office charged with investigating the
allegation is headed by that candidate's campaign manager,'' he
said.

   Some bulk purchasers did not even want the books they paid for.
For example, Wright addressed the annual meeting of the
Mid-Continent Oil &amp; Gas Association. Mid-Continent purchased $1,000
worth of Wright's book in lieu of paying him an honorarium, but
asked to receive only three books. Mid-Continent suggested that the
remaining books be distributed to libraries and other public
institutions of Wright's choice. There are no records reflecting
the requested distribution.
   The Select Committee on Ethics interpreted Rule XLVII, clause 1
in Advisory Opinion No. 13 which makes it clear that the
limitations on outside earned income may not be avoided by the mere
characterization of a payment. ``In all cases, the real facts will
control.'' (Select Committee on Ethics, Advisory Opinion No. 13,
Ethics Manual p. 179.) In this case, the facts reveal that Wright
compiled a series of previous speeches and writings into a
commercially unpublishable manuscript. His good friend Carlos Moore
formed a publishing company for the purpose of producing the book
and entering into a so-called ``royalty'' agreement inordinately
favorable to Wright. Together they sold the book almost exclusively
to lobbyists, persons interested in legislation and other interest
groups in order to provide income to Wright.
   The resulting income does not therefore become ``royalty''
income just because Moore calls himself a ``publisher'' and claims
to pay ``royalties'' on book sales. The ``royalty'' contract was
not an arms-length agreement between an author and his publisher,
but a joint business venture _ a means by which Moore could help
his friend Wright obtain money in excess of congressional
limitations.
   Receipts from sales of Wright's book should thus be
characterized as outside earned income, not copyright royalties,
and subject to the limits and reporting requirements for such
income. As Advisory Opinion No. 13 makes clear, income a member
earns through his own personal efforts is earned income for
purposes of Rule XLVII, clause 1 even when the income is first paid
to a corporation and then distributed to the member. In this
matter, Wright earned income from the books through his performance
of publisher's duties including the marketing of the book.
   However, whether or not the income from sales of the book may be
considered ``royalties,'' when books are allegedly ``sold'' to
lobbyists or interest groups, but no books are delivered to those
groups in exchange for their payments, the books retained are
``gifts'' received from persons with an interest in legislation
before Congress. Those books are also ``gifts'' when the group
``donates'' the books to a library or institution of Wright's
choice.
   Furthermore, where the books are purchased in lieu of paying a
customary fee for a speech or appearance, the payment received is
an ``honorarium,'' in the form of a ``royalty.'' The term
``honorarium'' is defined to mean ``the payment of something of
value `accepted as consideration for an appearance, speech, or
article.''' (Ethics manual, p. 83, quoting 11 C.F.R. 110.12(b); see
also 2 U.S.C. 31-1.) In this case, the ``royalty'' was itself the
honorarium paid for Wright's appearance.
   Thus as discussed in full in Section III. C. of this Report,
Wright's receipts of outside earned income, including honoraria, in
excess of 30 percent of his congressional salary are violations of
House Rule XLVII, clause 1. In addition, gifts exceeding $100 from
lobbyists and other groups with interests in legislation before
Congress are violations of House rule XLIII, clause 4. Wright's
receipt of an honorarium in excess of the $2,000 limit imposed by 2
U.S.C. 441i is a violation of that law. Finally, his failures to
disclose the receipts of income, gifts and honoraria are violations
of House Rule XLIV.
   We found no evidence that campaign funds were used to produce
the book.

<HEAD>D. Wright's Use of Government Resources to Produce and Market ``Reflections
of a Public Man''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Wright used members of his staff to compile, type, proofread,
edit, and market his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man.'' The
book was Wright's own project, from which he personally received
income.
   Matthew Cossolotto, a writer and researcher on Wright's staff,
testified that he spent about 200 hours preparing the book for
printing. Other members of the staff had more limited roles in the
preparation of the book, e.g., Marshall Lynam, Wright's Chief of
Staff, solicited the quotes for the back cover of the book and also
participated to some extent in marketing the book; Charmayne Marsh,
Wright's Press Secretary, helped to select the photograph used on
the cover of the book; Mike Grisso occasionally entered passages
for the book onto the word processor; Dorothy Biard, the office
librarian, assisted in gathering and locating material; and Cathy
Mitchell, Wright's Executive Assistant and Scheduler, also
participated in marketing the book to various groups Wright gave
speeches to in 1984 and 1985. In addition, Wright used other
government resources, including a computer, to complete the
manuscript.

<HEAD>Algeria Suspends Games After Goalie Stabbed, 18 East Germans Reported
Hurt</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Stadium Disaster, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Algeria has ordered all soccer matches
suspended for a week following the stabbing of a goalie by fans
during a riot last week, officials said.
   In East Germany, a newspaper reported Monday that 18 people were
injured on April 7 when thousands of fans made a rush for tickets
to a soccer match.
   The reports followed the deaths of 94 British fans during a mad
rush Saturday at a soccer match in Sheffield, England.
   The president of the Algerian Football Federation, Mohamed
Baghdadi, said matches were suspended Saturday and would not resume
for a week. The statement Sunday came in response to violence at a
match the day before between Constantine and Setif that left two
players injured.
   Setif goalie Antar Osmani was circled by about 100 fans and then
stabbed in the abdomen. He said he had never seen ``such savagery''
during his 14-year career.
   It was not clear why Osmani was attacked.
   Baghdadi said the suspension should be used for ``meditation,
consciousness-raising and a call to responsibility.''
   In Berlin, the government-run newspaper Young World said fans
were injured during a run on tickets April 7 for a Union of
European Football Associations semifinal game between the Dynamo
Dresden soccer club and Stuttgart of West Germany.
   The newspaper printed a letter by students of Dresden's
Technical University, which said the ticket sale began suddenly
around midnight, causing ``chaotic conditions.''
   It also printed a reply by Peter Stehr, security chief for the
Dresden club, which said 18 people were hurt.
   Stehr's letter said the injuries were caused by ``inconsiderate
behavior and by the pushing and shoving of the unreasonable
(fans).'' He said the club also would revise the way it sold
tickets.
   The newspaper earlier reported that some fans had been camping
for two days for tickets to Wednesday's game.
   The students' letter said the box offices ``opened suddenly and
prematurely,'' suggesting that the injuries were caused by a crush
of thousands of fans trying to get into the line when officials
began selling tickets eight hours ahead of the announced time.
   All 38,000 tickets were sold by the morning, the newspaper said.

   Certainly, materials paid for by government funds may not be
appropriated for personal use. Thus, technically, Wright's use of a
government word processor, for example, to prepare a book from
which he derived personal income was a violation of 31 U.S.C.
1301(a) which provides that government appropriations are to be
used solely for the purpose for which they were appropriated.
   It is not so clear, however, whether Wright's use of his
congressional staff to produce and market his book is a violation
of 31 U.S.C. 1301(a). No attempt was made to keep work on the book
separate from work on official business. No records were kept of
hours worked on the book as compared to the hours spent on official
business. Matthew Cossolotto, who spent far more time than any
other staff employee working on the book, testified that he worked
on the book about 200 hours over eight to eleven months. Other
staff members also testified that during that period, there were
weeks in which staff worked substantially more than 40 hour weeks.
Thus it is entirely possible, and in some instances even probable,
that although some work on the book was certainly done during the
normal 9 to 5 work day, staff employees worked on the book in
addition to completing all the work ordinarily done as part of
their official duties.
   Such use of staff time is specifically permitted under House
ethics guidelines. ...
   Moreover, members are given wide discretion to determine the
conditions and the duties of employment. The enormous breadth and
ambiguity of these ``guidelines'' makes it virtually impossible to
prevent members from using staff employees paid by government funds
from working on projects providing personal income to the member.
   Thus as discussed in full in Section III.D. of this Report,
because it is impossible to determine with the required certainty
that Wright had his staff working on the book during time that
should have been devoted to his official business, we do not
conclude that Wright violated any law or standard of conduct.

<HEAD>E. Wright's Use of a Condominium in Fort Worth, Texas</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In 1979, Jim and Betty Wright and their good friends George and
Marlene Mallick formed and became equal shareholders in Mallightco,
Inc. Mallightco invested in commercial paper, securities, real
estate and oil and gas ventures for the general purpose of making
money for its shareholders. Mallightco was funded in February 1980
with $58,127 in cash from the Mallicks and roughly the equivalent
in marketable securities from the Wrights.
   Throughout Wright's investment in Mallightco, it was used as a
conduit for cash flowing from the Mallicks to the Wrights. For
example, Mallightco began lending money to the Mallicks and the
Wrights in August 1980. The first loan, on August 15, 1980 was for
$4,375 each. The second loan on September 3, 1980 was for $5,536.09
each. The Mallicks paid off their loans in December 1980 by selling
Mallightco a 1979 Cadillac Seville valued at $10,575 and credited
against the loans. The Wrights made no payments on these loans
during 1980.
   In September 1980, Marlene Mallick obtained a $150,000 loan from
the Ridglea Bank which she immediately loaned to Mallightco. The
interest rate on the loan from Ridglea Bank apparently fluctuated
above the prime lending rate. On September 12, 1980, the Mallicks
and the Wrights then each borrowed $75,000 from Malme rate
reached 20.5 percent in May 1981 and again in July 1981), the
interest rate on the loan from Mallightco to the Wrights remained
at 13.5 percent.
   The net effect of these loans from Mallightco to the Wrights is
that during the first year of business, the Wrights had recovered
their entire investment from Mallightco plus an additional $25,000.
The Mallicks had added $65,000 in cash and a $10,575 car to their
initial investment. The Wrights received a gift worth over $100
from the Mallicks in the form of reduced interest payments during
1981, 1982, and 1984 when market rates exceeded 13.5 percent. They
also received a gift from the Mallicks in the form of Marlene
Mallick's creditworthiness and her ability to obtain financing from
the Ridglea Bank for the Wrights. Although the gift is difficult to
value, we believe it is worth more than $100. Wright's failure to
disclose these gifts are also violations of House Rule XLIV.

<HEAD>Shamir Makes Unannounced Visit to Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
made an unannounced visit to Hungary, and Israel radio reported the
two countries apparently planned to renew diplomatic ties.
   A one-sentence announcement by the official Hungarian news
agency MTI said Shamir arrived in Budapest. It did not specify
whether the visit was private or official and gave no other details.
   In Jerusalem, a Shamir aide confirmed the rare unannnounced trip
and said the prime minister is due back on Tuesday. He refused to
elaborate on the purpose of the visit.
   The visit was not announced in Israel before the midnight Israel
radio report, which said the two nations apparently planned to
renew diplomatic ties. The report did not elaborate.
   Hungary would be the first East European nation to resume full
ties with Israel since all Soviet bloc nations except Romania broke
relations during the Middle East War in 1967.
   
   Shamir was accompanied to Hungary by Justice Minister Dan
Meridor, Israeli officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Shamir made what was billed as a private visit to Budapest in
September when he met with Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz.
Upon his return, he announced Budapest had agreed to renew full
diplomatic ties with Israel.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth has said he expected full diplomatic
relations to be restored between the two countries by June.
   Earlier Monday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry announced that
Hungarian and Israeli officials had set up two joint committees to
improve commercial ties between the two countries as a step toward
normalizing diplomatic relations.
   This was agreed during a four-day visit to Israel by Hungary's
deputy foreign minister, Laszlo Kovacs, which ended Sunday.
   Kovacs said last week that Hungary would like to ``accelerate''
the process of normalizing relations.

<TEXT>
   Reginald Bartholomew, who was U.S. ambassador
to Lebanon in 1985 when U.S. arms were exchanged for the release of
an American hostage, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Monday he knew ``precious little'' about the operation.
   Bartholomew, President Bush's choice for undersecretary of state
for security affairs, said that in September 1985, he was directed
by the National Security Council to make arrangements to receive a
hostage and get him out of Lebanon quickly and safely.
   On Sept. 14, 1985 a group of pro-Iranian Lebanese extremists
released the Rev. Benjamin Wier, one of six American hostages then
being held in Lebanon.
   Bartholomew said he reported the NSC directive to the State
Department and made the requested logistical arrangements.
   But he said he was not told, and did not know, that Wier was
released in exchange for Israeli shipments to Iran of 508 U.S.-made
TOW antitank missiles.
   And he said he also did not know that Oliver L. North, then a
Marine lieutenant colonel attached to the NSC staff, had visited
Beirut.
   ``If Oliver North was in Beirut when I was there as ambassador,
I did not know it,'' Bartholomew said. ``I knew precious little
about the organization of the whole affair or who was involved.''
   ``I was not involved in Iran-Contra in any way,'' Bartholomew
said.
   Bartholomew was interviewed in private but was never called as a
public witness during the various investigations into the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Bartholomew, 53, has served in a number of State Department
policy positions. He has been U.S. ambassador to Spain since 1986.
   The Foreign Relations Committee is expected to recommend Senate
confirmation of the Bartholomew nomination, with final action
likely later this week.

<HEAD>Sinhalese Militants Kill Four Soldiers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sinhalese militants detonated
explosives buried in the road and blew up an army truck on Monday
in southeast Sri Lanka, killing four soldiers and wounding eight,
government officials said.
   The vehicle was on patrol in Embilipitiya, 80 miles southeast of
Colombo, reported the officials, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules.
   They said an attacker was killed during a raid by Sinhalese
extremists on a police station in Kurunagala district, 85 miles
northeast of Colombo.
   The violence came one day before expiration of a one-week
cease-fire announced by President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
   The truce was part of a peace package the government offered to
Sinhalese and Tamil extremists in a bid to end six years of ethnic
violence that has claimed at least 12,600 lives.
   Left-wing Sinhalese militants rejected the offer, but the
largest Tamil militant group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
agreed on Saturday to hold talks with the government.
   Premadasa asked the Tamil rebels to pick a team for talks aimed
at ending their campaign for a separate Tamil homeland.
   The Tamil acceptance came after at least 100 people died last
week in attacks that were blamed on the rebels.
   The Tamils, most of them Hindus, comprise 18 percent of this
island nation's 16 million people. The Tamils began the separatist
campaign in 1983, saying the majority Sinhalese discriminated
against them in jobs and education.
   Sinhalese, mostly Buddhists, make up 75 percent of the
population and control the government and the military.
   The Tamil Tigers rejected an India-sponsored July 1987 accord
that gave Tamils limited autonomy, complaining it did not meet
their demands for self-rule.
   Sri Lanka lies just south of the Indian peninsula in the Indian
Ocean. India became involved because its own 60 million Tamils were
sympathetic to the rebel cause.
   The accord triggered a violent Sinhalese backlash. Sinhalese
extremists, who belong to the Marxist People's Liberation Front,
said the agreement conceded too much to the Tamils and vowed to
kill anyone who supported it.
   The Front has been blamed for more than 2,500 political killings
since January. Most of the victims were government officials and
security personnel.

   The House approved on Monday a bill to remove
remaining federal price controls on natural gas.
   The measure, passed and sent to the Senate by voice vote,
removes all price controls at the wellhead. However, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission would retain the power to regulate
rates charged by interstate natural gas pipelines and states would
retain their regulatory powers over consumer prices.
   Most gas from wells drilled after the enactment of the 1978
Natural Gas Policy Act has been decontrolled for several years. The
new legislation would gradually remove controls from ``old gas,''
that from wells predating the 1978 act.

   Arab reports said Israeli soldiers killed two
teen-agers Monday, the latest victims in a surge of violence that
has cost the lives of 12 Palestinians in the occupied territories
in five days.
   Rafideh Khalili Ahmad Abu Laban, 13, and Kayed Mousa Salama, 14,
were shot to death in stone-throwing protests during funerals for
earlier victims, the reports said. Ms. Laban was killed in the
occupied West Bank and Salama in the Gaza Strip.
   A third Palestinian was electrocuted Monday when he climbed a
power pole and tried to raise an outlawed Palestinian flag, and a
fourth died of earlier injuries.
   Hospital officials said a 50-year-old woman of a family named
Ayat in Jerusalem's Zeytoun district was killed by a bullet through
the heart and a male member of the family, aged betweem 25 and 30,
also was killed.
   A young woman in her 20s was reported in serious condition and
two children aged 2 and 12 also were reported wounded.
   No further details were given and circumstances of the shooting
were unclear. The army said there was no army activity or gunfire
in Zeytoun.
   Arab sources said 10 Palestinians were wounded in other clashes.
Two Israelis were reported injured in scattered stoning incidents
in the West Bank.
   Jewish settlers in a tiny enclave in the West Bank city of
Hebron said they were creating a mobile armed militia and using
attack dogs to defend their houses against Arab stonings.
   ``We've decided to create a trained group of people that would
not interfere with the army but will reach troublesome spots and
help defend Jewish houses in Hebron,'' settler leader Aharon Domb
said on Israel radio. ``We'll also secure Jewish houses by using
guard and attack dogs, to be unleashed only in emergency
situations.''
   In Jerusalem, a Palestinian human rights group appealed to the
United States and the European Community to urge an independent
investigation of the killings of four Palestinians during a border
police raid last week on Nahalin, a West Bank village.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejected Palestinian demands for
at least a partial army withdrawal as a condition for agreeing to
elections in the occupied lands.
   ``There is nothing to talk about regarding changes in the
deployment of Israeli army forces,'' Shamir said on army radio.
``This deployment is necessary to maintain order, and order is
necessary for elections.''
   Radio reports said Shamir went before a parliamentary committee
Monday and defended his election plan against critics in his own
right-wing Likud bloc who said elections could be the first step to
creating a Palestinian state. Shamir proposes the elections to
choose Palestinians to negotiate with Israel.
   ``I will talk, and discuss, and argue with my friends. I hope
I'll convince them that although these doubts have some basis ...
we can overcome such things,'' the prime minister said on Israel
television.
   ``If those implementing the plan decide that there will be no
Palestinian state here, I'm saying there will be no Palestinian
state.''
   Shamir told the committee Palestinian election candidates would
have to agree to certain limits in advance, including rejecting a
Palestinian state, Israel radio said.
   He also said he opposes international supervision of the vote.
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday demanded such supervision and
the withdrawal of Israeli troops as a condition for elections.
Palestinians in the occupied lands hinted a partial withdrawal
would be a step toward the polls.
   On Monday, soldiers fired as hundreds of Arab youths threw
stones, waved outlawed Palestinian flags and set tires ablaze
during a funeral procession in Dheishe refugee camp near the West
Bank town of Bethlehem, Arab reports said.
   Ms. Laban was shot in the forehead and died en route to a
hospital, the reports said.
   In Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, troops fired on
stone-throwing youths after the funeral of a 50-year-old man who
died earlier Monday, reportedly from a beating by soldiers, Arab
witnesses said.
   Salama died at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital after a bullet sliced
an artery in his leg, hospital officials said.
   In the Gaza village of Bani Suheila, 21-year-old Mahmoud Shihada
Abu-Shad was electrocuted while trying to display a Palestinian
flag, Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed the death of 50-year-old Faris Said Falha
without commenting on the cause.
   An official at Mukassed Hospital in east Jerusalem said Falha
died of spinal injuries after troops beat him on March 27.
   At least 438 Palestinians have been killed killed in the
16-month-old uprising. Eighteen Israelis have also died.

<TEXT>
   In 1981, Mallightco loaned the Wrights an additional $37,000.
Over the period 1981 through 1983, the Wrights and the Mallicks
made regular payments on their loans from the proceeds of their
other investments. However, beginning in 1984, the Wrights made
little progress in reducing the outstanding principal balance and,
in fact, were not meeting their interest payments. The debt
continued to accrue interest; Mallightco never demanded payment
from the Wrights or took any steps to collect the debt.
   Mallightco distributed several dividends to its shareholders in
1986 and 1987. Despite the Wrights' failure to make significant
payments on their loans, the company distributed $59,000 in cash to
the Wrights as dividends. While the Mallicks also received
dividends during this period, all dividends to the Mallicks were
paid in the form of credits against their outstanding debts to the
company until their loans were completely repaid in 1987.
   On June 9, 1988, the Wrights (through the James C. Wright Jr.
Blind Trust formed in October 1987) sold their Mallightco shares
back to the company for $350,000, the alleged market value of the
shares at the time of sale. The price consisted of $230,000 cash
and a $120,000 unsecured, five-year, 10 percent interest-bearing
note subordinate to all present and future debt of Mallightco. The
Wrights paid back most of their outstanding loan balance, then
$80,000, from the cash received from the sale. Approximately
$12,700 in accured interest was forgiven in the transaction between
Mallightco and the Blind Trust.
   It appears that the Wrights received greater benefit from their
interest in Mallightco than did the Mallicks since the Wrights had
the use of a substantial amount of cash provided by the Mallicks.
However, although no effort was made to collect the Wrights' loans
from Mallightco, those loans did accrue interest at the rate of
approximately 10 percent per year and were ultimately paid back
almost entirely. Although $12,700 in interest was not paid back,
that transaction occurred between Mallick and the trustee of
Wright's Blind Trust. Special Outside Counsel assumes that Wright
was unaware of this gift to his Blind Trust and will rectify the
account with Mallick when the gift is made known to him. Thus
Wright ultimately paid for the use of the money he borrowed and has
apparently not violated any law or ethical standard with respect to
his Mallightco investment.
   On the other hand, we believe that Wright violated House Rules
with respect to his indirect receipt of and failure to report
additional gifts from the Mallicks bestowed in the form of salary
paid to Betty Wright by Mallightco; free housing to the Wrights in
Fort Worth from 1979 through March 1988; and the use of a 1979
Cadillac Seville in Washington, D.C. from 1983 until approximately
February 1989.
   Betty Wright began working for Mallick in 1979 as a part-time
consultant for Mallick Properties, Inc. which hired Mrs. Wright to
help Mallick expand his real estate ventures into areas of Texas
beyond Fort Worth. Mrs. Wright earned $18,000 per year for her
part-time work on a brochure entitled ``The Mallick Community
Concept''; for market studies of Austin and San Antonio, Texas; and
for her access to officials and other key people in the Austin and
San Antonio areas. Although it is impossible to determine how much
time Mrs. Wright devoted to her employment with Mallick Properties,
Inc., it does appear that she did identifiable work on projects
arguably within her expertise which may have been worth $18,000 a
year to the company.
   On January 1, 1981, Mrs. Wright went on the payroll of
Mallightco, Inc. at a salary of $1,500 per month. According to
Mallick, Mrs. Wright was hired as a consultant to seek out new
investment opportunities for Mallightco. However, Mrs. Wright,
formerly on the staff of the Subcommittee on Investigations and
Oversight of the House Public Works Committee, had no education or
prior experience in investment analysis or financial counseling.
She performed few, if any, services to Mallightco which has no
record of any work product she created.
   Furthermore, although Mallick testified that Mrs. Wright
``assisted'' him and ``advised'' him, he could not articulate what
valuable services she performed. He testified to research she did
on several investment opportunities during the four years she was
paid by Mallightco, but could not produce any research reports or
even point to one investment Mrs. Wright researched which was
ultimately made by the company.
   Moreover, although Mallick was the one responsible for making
investment decisions and both he and his assistant, Pamela Smith,
performed services of value for Mallightco, neither Mallick nor
Smith received a salary from Mallightco. In fact, Mrs. Wright's
salary was Mallightco's greatest expense. The company frequently
had to borrow money from the Mallick Company or other Mallick
entities in order to pay Mrs. Wright's salary. Ultimately,
Mallightco could not continue the expense; Mrs. Wright's salary was
suspended as of December 31, 1984. Thus from 1981 through 1984,
Mrs. Wright's salary was a gift from Mallick.

<HEAD>Papandreou Takes Time Magazine to Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou filed a libel
lawsuit Monday accusing Time magazine of defaming him in a story
that suggested he took millions of dollars in payoffs, his American
lawyer said.
   The lawsuit was announced here by lawyer Leonard Boudin, who
said the lawsuit was filed in London because the story was more
damaging abroad than in the United States.
   He conceded, however, that another factor was that it is easier
for a public figure to make a case under English libel law than
under American.
   The Time story, which concerned allegations of financial
wrongdoing at a Greek bank that have rocked the Papandreou
government since last fall, was on the cover of the magazine's
March 13 international edition. A similar story ran in the U.S.
edition, but it was not the cover story.
   The articles quoted former Greek bank president George Koskotas,
who is jailed in Massachusetts and fighting extradition to Greece,
as saying he passed millions from the Bank of Crete to Papandreou
and other figures in the premier's Socialist government.
   Papandreou has been Greece's premier since 1981. His government
is up for re-election in June, but the banking scandal and the
70-year premier's open affair with a 34-year-old former airline
stewardess have hurt his standing among voters, according to recent
polls.
   Papandreou has denounced the Time article as part of an
international conspiracy to topple his government.
   Boudin said Papandreou would ask for ``a considerable,
reasonable sum'' in damages from Time, but said the amount hasn't
been decided. He said clearing Papandreou's name was the main
reason for the lawsuit, launched only after Time failed to respond
to a demand for an public apology and retraction.
   Time promised in a statement to ``vigorously defend'' itself.
   ``What is most alarming about the announcement of this lawsuit
is the inescapable conclusion that Prime Minister Papandreou is
suing the messenger because he wishes to discredit the message,''
the magazine said in a statement.
   ``Such a suit, just by being brought, disregards a central role
of the press in a free, democratic society _ which is to make
important information available to the public. Time magazine will
take whatever steps are necessary to fight the allegations of this
lawsuit and defend its right to report news and information it
deems in the public interest,'' the statement said.
   Boudin said he could not recall another case in which a head of
state sued for libel, although there have been a number of cases
brought by highly placed public figures in recent years, including
the lawsuit filed against Time by Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli
defense minister.
   In that case, a New York jury found in 1985 that Time had erred
but had not acted with malice and therefore did not have to pay
damages.
   In England, Papandreou need only show that the story written
about him was defamatory and injured his reputation, while the
magazine has the task of proving that what it wrote was true,
Boudin said. In the United States, Papandreou would have to show
not only that Time wrote untruths but that it acted with malice.
   Besides New York-based Time, the lawsuit filed in London names
as defendants Time-Life branches in London and Amsterdam, and the
writer of the article, Robert Ajemian.
   Time wrote that Papandreou had refused to be interviewed or to
answer questions the magazine submitted before publishing the
article. But Boudin countered that the questions were of a general
sort about government integrity and not about any specific
accusations of wrongdoing by Papandreou.

<HEAD>OF THE RESOLUTION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The second area pursued by Special Outside Counsel was:
   The circumstances surrounding (Representative Wright's)
intervention in a matter before the Department of the Interior on
behalf of Texas Oil &amp; Gas Company.
   Counsel reported that on September 28, 1979, Representative
Wright co-signed a letter to Secretary of the Interior, Cecil D.
Andrus, on behalf of Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corporation (``TXO''). The
letter provided Secretary Andrus with background information on TXO
and its dispute with the Arkla Exploration Company over mineral
exploration leases on land in Arkansas.
   The undisputed facts are that Representative Wright held no
interest in TXO at any relevant time. As discussed in the Counsel's
report, from February 1979 until March 1984, Representative Wright
held an interest in the Whatley No. 1 well, an east-Texas natural
gas well drilled and operated by TXO. However, as an investor in
the well, Representative Wright's financial return was determined
only by the productivity of the well and could not have been
affected by TXO's success or failure with respect to the Arkansas
leases. Representative Wright's September 28, 1979, letter did not
comment upon the merits of the dispute between TXO and Arkla nor
did it demand or request extraordinary action by department
officials. In view of these findings, Special Outside Counsel
concluded that Representative Wright's letter was not an improper
communication.
   The committee concurred. ...

<HEAD>COMMITTEE ACTION TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH ITEM NO. 4</HEAD>
<HEAD>OF THE RESOLUTION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The fourth area explored by Special Outside Counsel was:
   Whether government resources were improperly used to complete
work on a book (``Reflections of a Public Man'') from which he
(Representative Wright) received royalties.
   Special Outside Counsel reported that Matthew Cossolotto, a
writer and researcher on Representative Wright's staff, testified
that he spent about 200 hours over an 8-11 month period preparing
the book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' for printing. Other
members of the congressman's staff had more limited roles in the
preparation of the book.
   In addition, Representative Wright's congressional office used
some government resources to complete the manuscript, albeit on an
apparently limited basis. While materials paid for by government
funds may not be put to personal use, the Special Outside Counsel
did not focus on this issue because of the limited extent to which
this occurred. Instead, counsel examined the efforts of
Representative Wright's staff _ primarily Mr. Cossolotto, in
assisting book preparation.
   Special Outside Counsel concluded that a violation warranting
further action was not indicated. Based upon the evidence and
testimony, counsel did not conclude that Representative Wright's
use of his congressional staff to prepare his book violated
relevant standards of conduct. In this connection, while no
apparent attempt was made to keep the staff's work on the book
separate from their work on official business, it nevertheless
remains that no records were kept of hours worked on the book as
compared to the hours spent on official business. This applied to
not only Matthew Cossolotto, who spent far more time than any other
staff employee working on the book, but the other staff members as
well.
   Relevant testimony of Representative Wright's staff was that
during the time of book preparation, there were periods during
which staff worked substantially more than 40 hour work weeks. Thus
it is entirely possible, indeed even probable, that although some
work on the book was done during the ``normal'' 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
work day, staff employees worked on the book in addition to
completing all the tasks ordinarily done as part of their official
duties. ...

<HEAD>Two Missing After Cargo Ship Apparently Sinks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with two sailors missing, details on sinking,
rescue, ship, other details; no pickup. Clarifies that survivors were found
on lifeboat, sted life raft.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two sailors were missing Monday evening after a
652-foot freighter en route from Greece apparently sank in rough
seas 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod. Twenty-three crew members
were rescued.
   The 23 sailors from the Star of Alexandria were found on a
lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig, Coast
Guard Petty Officer Randy Midgett said in New York.
   ``They're all in good shape, some minor cuts and scrapes,''
Midgett said.
   The two missing sailors were believed to be on a life raft,
which was the object of a hunt Monday evening by the 950-foot
Ravenscraig and five Navy and Coast Guard search planes, officials
said.
   The Ravenscraig's crew spotted a second life raft, but it turned
out to be empty.
   The cause of the sinking was not immediately known, officials
said.
   The Star of Alexandria had been en route from Athens, Greece, to
New York with a load of cement when it began taking on water in
12-foot seas and winds up to 35 mph, Midgett said. The first mayday
call went out at 9:05 a.m.
   A Coast Guard jet from the air station on Cape Cod and a C-130
plane from Elizabeth City, N.C., converged on the ship. The
lifeboat was spotted around noon.
   The C-130 was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat
carrying the 23 crew members and they were able to establish
communications, Midgett said. About four hours later, they were
rescued by the Ravenscraig.
   The Star of Alexandria was not spotted, and was presumed to be
sinking or sunk, Midgett said. Visibility in the rough seas was
five to eight miles Monday afternoon.
   The Star of Alexandria was built in 1966, and was registered in
England. It was designed to carry bulk freight, and was owned by
Caribene Investments Ltd. of Gibraltar, according to Bureau
Veritas, a Paris-based shipping registry.
   The Ravenscraig had been bound for England, but its destination
after its rescue mission was not immediately known.

   Accordingly, because it was not possible to determine whether
Representative Wright directed his staff to work on the book during
time that should have been devoted to official business, Special
Outside Counsel did not conclude that Representative Wright
violated any law or standard of conduct.
   The committee concurred with Special Outside Counsel. Central to
the committee's conclusion was the undisputed fact that Mr.
Cossolotto, the primary staff person who assisted Representative
Wright on the book, did not ``create'' text for the congressman.
Instead, Mr. Cossolotto's efforts focused solely on editing the
congressman's words as opposed to creating and editing text of his
own devise. Thus, it can be fairly said that Mr. Cossolotto's
efforts were not solicited for the purpose of generating text for
Representative Wright's book but, rather, for the editing of text
previously prepared by the congressman. Second, and of equal
importance, is the fact that there is no evidence supporting a
finding that Mr. Cossolotto's work on the book was done to the
detraction of his official responsibilities as a congressional
staff member. Consequently, it is entirely reasonable that Mr.
Cossolotto's time working on the book, regardless of when it
occurred, did not deny the government (specifically, Representative
Wright's congressional office) full value of services paid for out
of the official allowance.
   In the light of the foregoing, the committee did not conclude
that there is reason to believe that a violation has occurred in
connection with Mr. Cossolotto's or other staff activities
associated with preparation of Representative Wright's book. Again,
this conclusion is buttressed by the fact that no records were
maintained regarding Mr. Cossolotto's (or other staff) daily
activities, the irregular nature of work hours by congressional
staff, and the fact that there is no evidence that Mr. Cossolotto's
fulfillment of his official responsibilities suffered as a result
of his efforts on the book.

<HEAD>Snow In Montana, Thunderstorms In The Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Montana got at least 4 inches of spring snow Monday as
showers and thunderstorms fell across the Midwest ahead of a cold
front that dropped temperatures 12 degrees in an hour.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell from Michigan to Indiana,
Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas. In northern Indiana, thunderstorms
produced hail a quarter-inch in diameter near Gary, South Bend and
Mentone.
   Montana's morning snowstorm dropped 2 inches of snow in an hour
in the capital of Helena. Four inches fell in Missoula in six hours.
   The cold front brought sharply cooler weather to the upper
Mississippi Valley and the northern and central Plains.
   Temperatures Monday afternoon were about 30 degrees lower than
at the same time Sunday from northern Wisconsin and Minnesota to
western Nebraska and northwest Kansas. In North Platte, Neb., the
temperature was 37 degrees at 1 p.m., compared to 72 degrees Sunday.
   As the front moved through Chicago, generating winds off chilly
Lake Michigan, the temperature fell from 60 degrees to 48 degrees
in an hour.
   In contrast, warm air pushing eastward raised temperatures in
the central Rockies.
   The mercury jumped from 49 degrees to 61 in an hour in Casper,
Wyo. At 1 p.m., it was 70 in Craig, Colo., and 43 in Cheyenne,
Wyo., which remained in the cooler air.
   Scattered thunderstorms fell in southern Florida. While sunshine
prevailed along the West Coast, the central and southern coast of
California were cloudy.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 27
degrees at International Falls, Minn., to 93 degrees at Midland,
Texas.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for showers and scattered
thunderstorms from northeast Texas and southeast Oklahoma to
Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and the central and southern
Appalachians; rain showers in the middle and northern Atlantic
Coast states; and scattered showers and thunderstorms in central
and southern Florida.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 40s and 50s from North
Dakota to the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and New
England; the 80s from inland California to much of Texas and New
Mexico and the Gulf Coast states; the 90s in southwest Texas; the
90s to near 100 degrees in the desert Southwest and in the 60s and
70s elsewhere.

<HEAD>Rightist Party to Create Information Agency on Rebel Activity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President-elect Francisco
Merino said Monday leftist rebels are ``the only generators of
violence'' in El Salvador and his rightist party is forming an
agency to keep track of them.
   He was asked if abductions and killings of leftists by
right-wing groups constituted terrorism and he said: ``Not that I
know of, because there is no extreme right.''
   Merino of the Republican Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena,
blamed rebels for a bomb attack on his home Friday that caused
extensive damage and slightly injured a nephew.
   Merino and his wife Maria Antonieta were not at home at the time
of the bombing. Four children and two other nephews in the house
were not harmed.
   Merino and President-elect Alfredo Cristiani of Arena won the
March 19 election, defeating the centrist Christian Democrats, and
are to be inaugurated June 1 for five-year terms.
   At a news conference Monday, Merino gave the names, addresses
and workplaces of eight people he said belonged to the guerrilla
cell that attacked his home. He said the information came from a
rebel who was captured and interrogated by police but released for
lack of evidence of involvement in the bombing.
   Police have not arrested the eight people he named ``because of
an excess of work, for lack of resources or for lack of will,''
Merino said.
   He said Arena was forming an intelligence service to receive
information from citizens about activities of the rebel alliance,
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   ``Our party, our local headquarters and our leaders will receive
in confidentiality'' all the information and pass it on to ``the
armed forces, the police and judicial authorities, according to the
case,'' he said.
   ``People should go before our local leaders and tell them of
these cases,'' he added. ``The members of our organization meet
frequently and this way we can elaborate a more complete picture''
of the rebel movement ``so the people play a more active role in
imposing order.''
   Arena was founded in 1981 as an anti-communist group.
International human rights organizations and the U.S. government
linked party leaders, some of whom remain active, to rightist death
squads that killed thousands of people in the early 1980s.
   The party denies any connection with death squads and Cristiani
did not join the party until 1985.
   Merino said Arena would be only a conduit for citizen reports
and would not take follow-up action on its own.
   He said ``security forces would definitely be the ones to take
appropriate action. Arena is a civilian institution. We do not have
the capacity to counter the military action of these groups.''
   Merino called the guerrillas ``the only generators of violence
in El Salvador'' and added: ``If we can minimize the terrorists'
action, the level of violence, of victims, will tend to diminish.''
   Leftist rebels began their battle for power nine years ago. More
than 70,000 Salvadorans have been killed and most of the victims
were civilians.

<HEAD>WASHN: from Mallick.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   During the 1979 through 1984 period that Mrs. Wright was on the
payroll of Mallick Properties, Inc. and Mallightco, she and her
husband also received free housing from Mallick just steps away
from his office in Fort Worth. Mallick testified that housing was
provided, not as a part of compensation, but because it was
convenient for him to have Mrs. Wright living only a few feet away
from his office. Mallick could not explain why her job required her
to be so close to his office. In fact, much of her work for Mallick
Properties was done in Austin and San Antonio. Moreover, throughout
her employment with Mallick, Mrs. Wright lived primarily in
Washington, D.C., spending on the average only one week a month in
Fort Worth. Thus her consulting jobs plainly were not jobs
requiring her to be close to the office. The free housing was thus
not job related, but a gift from Mallick.
   Beginning in 1985, the Wrights began paying rent for the housing
Mallick provided. The rent was determined by dividing the fair
monthly rental of the apartment, $650, by 30, the average number of
days in a month. The Wrights were charged $21.67 (or sometimes
$21.00 or $21.50) for each day they personally occupied the
apartment notwithstanding the fact that since their furniture and
personal belongings occupied the apartment every day, they had
constructive possession of the apartment daily. Thus in 1985, the
Wrights paid rent of $881.50 for the equivalent of 41 days at
$21.50 per day. In 1986, an election year, they paid $1,711.92 for
79 days. In 1987, they paid $756 for 36 days. At fair market rent,
the apartment would have cost the Wrights $7,800 per year. Finally,
after renting for 10 days through March 1988, the Wrights bought
the apartment at what appears to be its fair market value of
$58,500. Wright's receipt of housing at substantially below market
rental is a gift from Mallick.
   Beginning in 1983, Mallick provided Betty Wright with free use
of Mallightco's 1979 Cadillac Seville. Mrs. Wright brought the car
to Washington and has used it there ever since. Although the car is
referred to in Mallightco's records as the ``BW Cad.,'' Mallightco
owned the car until approximately February 1989 and paid expenses
including license fees, insurance, tires and repairs until
approximately February 1989.
   On February 16, 1989, Special Outside Counsel received a copy of
a February 9, 1989 letter to the Committee from Thomas H. Law,
trustee of the James C. Wright Jr. Blind Trust. Law stated that he
recently discovered that:
   
   (T)he Speaker's wife, Betty, as an officer of Mallightco, used
an automobile owned by that company. I have been informed that the
parties treated this transaction as a loan of the car to Mrs.
Wright, to be handled similarly to other loans from Mallightco to
its principals. I have been further informed that the parties
intended that the automobile be purchased by the Trust at its
inception. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, the automobile was
overlooked at the Trust's creation and never accounted for.
   
   Thus only after Special Outside Counsel had completed its
investigation and questioned witnesses regarding Mrs. Wright's use
of the car, Law discovered the ``inadvertent'' omission of the car
from the Trust records. Law further stated in his letter:

<HEAD>One Of Three Stolen Van Goghs Returned To Dutch Museum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTERLO, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Monday that art thieves
returned one of three Van Gogh paintings stolen from a museum to
prove they had the other two and add pressure to their demand for a
$2.5 million ransom.
   But the thieves failed to give further instructions, no ransom
was paid and the location of the remaining two paintings _ ``Wilted
Sunflowers'' and an early version of the Dutch impressionist's
world famous ``The Potato Eaters'' _ remains a mystery, police
spokesman Sgt. Theo Reus told The Associated Press.
   He said the painting ``The Loom'' was recovered unharmed on
April 6 in the trunk of a car parked near the home of R.W.D.
Oxenaar, director of the Kroeller-Mueller National Museum in this
eastern Dutch village.
   Total value of the three works taken after a museum window was
smashed on Dec. 12 has been estimated at $100 million to $125
million.
   Recovery of ``The Loom'' followed almost a month of secret
negotiations between Oxenaar and the thieves, Reus said.
   He said that on March 13, the crooks sent Oxenaar a written
demand for a $2.5 million ransom in exchange for the three
paintings.
   The letter drew no response because it contained no proof the
sender was in possession of the paintings, he added.
   On March 22, a man telephoned Oxenaar asking, ``Why did you not
respond to my letter?'' and threatening to burn all three
paintings, Reus reported.
   A week later, he said, Oxenaar was mailed a recent photograph of
``Wilted Sunflowers'' that experts said was genuine, and on April
6, Oxenaar was called and told where ``The Loom'' had been left.
   ``They (the thieves) may have thought just a photograph wasn't
convincing enough,'' the sergeant said.
   He said the thieves called Oxenaar last Monday to arrange for
delivery of the ransom money, but did not follow up as promised
with further instructions.
   Reus said Monday of efforts to recover the masterpieces, ``We
haven't really found anything _ just one painting and that was
given to us.''

   I have currently rectified this situation by purchasing, as
Trustee, the automobile from Mallightco. The purchase price was
$7,050, the value of the automobile on Mallightco's books as of
January 1, 1983, at which time it was taken to Washington, D.C. The
Trust made a cash payment of $7,050 plus 7 percent interest dating
back to January 1, 1983, for a total cash payment of $10,011.
   In addition, the Trust holds a $120,000 note, payable from
Mallightco. This note has been reduced by $9,302.85, representing
the sums paid by Mallightco for insurance on and repairs to the
automobile from January 1, 1983 to present.
   
   Law does not explain how the oversight was discovered. Nor does
he explain how the purchase of the automobile in 1989 at its 1983
book value ``rectifies'' the Trust's failure to purchase the car in
1987. ...
   Plainly, Law's February 9, 1989 letter to the Committee is an
attempt to cover up Wright's violations of House Rule XLIII, clause
4, with respect to Mallick's gift of the car. Mallightco never
expected nor attempted to collect rental or `loan'' payments for
the car.
   George Mallick testified that Betty Wright had the car because
she ``would use (the car) in connection with her work for
Mallightco.'' However, even assuming that Betty Wright's employment
by Mallightco in 1983 and 1984 was bona fide, there is no evidence
that she did any work for Mallightco in Washington, D.C. which
required use of a car. In addition, regardless of the legitimacy of
Mrs. Wright's Mallightco employment, there is absolutely no
justification for her retention of the car after she stopped
working for the company. Therefore, the value of using the car from
1983 to date and all related expenses are gifts from Mallick to
Wright received in violation of House rules.
   Of course, in order for gifts to violate House Rules, they must
be received from someone with a direct interest in legislation
before Congress. In this matter, we believe it is clear that George
Mallick had such an interest. We further impute his interest in
legislation to his wife Marlene Mallick.
   Mallick is and has been a major real estate developer in Fort
Worth having developed commercial and residential properties worth
over $160 million. Prior to 1986, Mallick also had major holdings
in Texas oil and gas ventures. In 1986, he stood to profit from the
proposed redevelopment of the Fort Worth Stockyards which relied
heavily on public funds being appropriated by Congress. Thus, he
had a direct interest in legislation affecting the taxation of real
estate, interest rates, the oil and gas industries and
appropriations for the Stockyards project.
   In addition, Mallick's financing of certain real estate ventures
through savings and loan associations and the subsequent
foreclosure on at least one of those properties gave Mallick a
direct interest in legislation regarding the savings and loan
industry. Nevertheless, in late 1986, Wright designated Mallick to
conduct an investigation and prepare a report concerning the
``savings and loan crisis'' in Texas. The report addressed issues
of concern to Mallick and recommended legislation which would curb
the industry's right to foreclose on loans in default.
   Thus as discussed in full in Section III. E. of this Report,
Wright repeatedly violated House Rule XLIII, clause 4; Rule XLIV;
and consideration 5 of the Code of Ethics for Government Service.

<TEXT>
   Members of two farflung families came forward
from four states Monday to claim half the record $69.9 million
Illinois Lotto jackpot, leaving the holders of the two other
winning tickets unknown.
   ``It's more money than any of us ever expected to see in our
lifetimes,'' said Daniel Dixon, 38, of suburban Naperville, Ill..,
who bought one winning ticket for his wife's family.
   Louis and Mary Matlosz, of Elizabeth, N.J., and their four
children, including Dixon's wife MaryAnn, and three grandchildren,
joined Dixon at a news conference, saying they would split their
$17.5 million share of the jackpot and plan to spend the money on
vacations and on the grandchildren.
   Another winner was Ron Miller, 36, a hog buyer from Little York,
who will share his prize with brothers in Stafford, Texas, and
Chandler, Ariz.
   Miller said he was ``hysterical,'' after learning he had won.
``I sat at the table and laughed.''
   The news got around fast in Little York, a town of 300 in
west-central Illinois, and a big sign in the Post Office declared
``Congratulations, Ron.''
   State computers recorded that four winning tickets were sold _
two in the Chicago area, one in west-central Illinois and one in
southern Illinois.
   Both the Matlosz family and the Miller family bought 15 Lotto
tickets, and Miller said he was not surprised the $69.9 million
jackpot was being shared.
   ``It's more money than I'll ever use,'' Miller said.
   He said he would not quit work altogether, but ``I'll find
something I like a little better.''
   The Matlosz family members planned to keep working.
   The remaining winners were expected to come forward this week,
perhaps after making financial preparations.
   ``Most people will have already gotten some advice,'' said state
Lottery Director Sharon Sharp.
   The final figure for the jackpot, boosted by four winner-less
drawings and a frenzy of ticket-buying last week before Saturday's
drawing, was $69,940,000, Ms. Sharp said.
   The huge jackpot, which nearly doubled in the week before the
drawing, drew dreamers to Lotto outlets from around the country and
even the world, as travelers flocked to Lotto kiosks at O'Hare
International Airport between planes.
   By Monday, life was back to normal in Lotto-land. ``It's a lot
slower than last week,'' Ms. Sharp said.
   The jackpot, bolstered by a week of record sales, beat the world
record of $61.98 million set in October in California. That pot was
split among three winning tickets, one bought by an individual and
the others bought by groups of co-workers.
   If only one person had matched the numbers, the jackpot would
have been the largest paid to a single winner. But with four
ticket-holders sharing the pot, the largest single winner in U.S.
history remains a Florida woman who walked away with $55.16 million
in the Florida lottery in September.
   The winning numbers drawn Saturday were 3, 14, 32, 40, 46 and 54.
   Illinois Lotto players pick six numbers from 1 to 54 with two
chances on each $1 ticket. The odds that a ticket carries a winning
sequence are 12.9 million to 1.

<HEAD>COMMITTEE ACTION TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH ITEM NO. 6</HEAD>
<HEAD>OF THE RESOLUTION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The final item addressed in the Preliminary Inquiry concerns
Representative Wright's:
   Possible exercise of undue influence in dealing with officials
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Based upon his examination of a number of instances in which
Representative Wright interacted directly, or through staff, with
officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, Special Outside
Counsel concluded that there was reason to believe Representative
Wright exercised undue influence in dealing with that agency. The
committee did not concur.
   It is clear that under our constitutional form of government
there is a constant tension between the legislative and executive
branches regarding the desires of legislators on the one hand and
the actions of agencies on the other in carrying out their
respective responsibilities. The assertion that the exercise of
undue influence can arise based upon a legislator's expressions of
interest jeopardizes the ability of members effectively to
represent persons and organizations having concern with the
activities of executive agencies.
   Accordingly, while it may well be that Representative Wright was
intemperate in his dealings with representatives of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, the committee is not persuaded that there is
reason to believe that he exercised undue influence in dealing with
that agency. In sum, such a finding cannot rest on pure inference
or circumstance or, for that matter, on the technique and
personality of the legislator, but, instead, must be based on
probative evidence that a reprisal or threat to agency officials
was made.

<BYLINE>ADDITIONAL MATTERS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   During the course of counsel's investigation into the
circumstances surrounding the gifts received by Representative
Wright from George Mallick, a question was raised regarding
Mallightco, Inc.'s acquisition of a 4 percent interest in an oil
well deal known as the North Sabine Lake Prospect, located in
Orange County, Texas.
   In sum, counsel found that on May 10, 1988, Mallightco, Inc.,
with Michael Mallick acting on behalf of Mallightco, Inc., formally
acquired a 4 percent interest in the well from Jaffe Energy
Corporation for $9,120. Also on May 10, 1988, Mallick entered into
a transaction with Union Rheinische Petroleum, Inc. (``URP'') in
which URP loaned Mallightco, Inc.'s $440,000. ...
   What this meant was that Mallightco received $350,000 cash, owed
Jaffe nothing for drilling and completion expenses, and would
receive 1.5 percent of the working interest of the well after URP
received $440,000 in oil and gas revenues, but Mallightco would not
be liable for repayment of the loan. Soon after Mallightco executed
this agreement with URP, it tendered an offer to the Trustee of the
James C. Wright Jr. Blind Trust (the ``Blind Trust''), to
repurchase all the trust's shares of Mallightco, Inc. stock for
$350,000. This sale was consummated on June 9, 1988. Michael
Mallick submitted Mallightco's unaudited balance sheet dated May
16, 1988. The balance sheet reported Mallightco's total assets to
be $1,248,632, and its total liabilities to be $545,529. Mallightco
thus reported a net worth of $703,102. A majority of the company's
assets was its Sabine Lake investment, valued at $650,000.
Mallightco, Inc. paid the Blind Trust two checks totalling $230,000
and a promissory note in the amount of $120,000. The Trust endorsed
one check over to Mallightco, Inc. for $81,821.70, representing the
outstanding balance of the Trust's indebtedness to Mallightco
including part of the interest accrued, and tendered the Trust's
stock certificates back to Mallightco.
   Against the backdrop of these business transactions between
Jaffe Energy Corporation, Michael Mallick, Mallightco, Inc., and
Representative Wright's Blind Trust, all of which occurred during
the period January through June, 1988, are the salient facts
regarding drilling activities on the North Sabine Lake well.

<HEAD>WASHN: Lake well.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Drilling on the Sabine Lake well began March 4, 1988. The well
reached total depth of 11,560 on April 2, 1988, at a cost of
$1,256,151. The well operator, Brammer Engineering Co., ran an
electric log on that date to determine the potential productivity
of the well. The log revealed the probable presence of oil and gas
in a seven foot band of Hackberry sand at a depth of 11,272 -11,280
feet. Based upon these log indications, the owners of the well
(primarily Jaffe Energy, Inc. and Goodrich Oil Co.) decided to
comence completion operations.
   From April 3, 1988, to April 22, 1988, Brammer Engineering
worked to install the necessary equipment on the well to begin
testing and production. The initial tests on the well on April 23,
1988, indicated flows of oil and gas in commercially productive
amounts. ...
   However, over the next few days, testing revealed alarming
declines in oil and gas production and well pressures were
occurring. The well clearly had tapped into a reservoir containing
some oil and gas, but because the well pressure readings steadily
declined during all tests, it was also clear that the well was not
a gusher.
   Brammer Engineering undertook numerous attempts to stimulate
production in the well. ...
   All of these efforts had roughly the same result _ temporary
stimulation of production, but the wellhead pressures inexorably
dropped as time progressed. By May 4, 1988, the well had declined
to a point that it was uneconomical to test the negligible
quantities of gas and no oil. By May 10, 1988, Brammer had spent
nearly a million dollars trying to complete the well.
   Despite these disheartening results from the well, on May 10,
1988, URP nevertheless acquired Michael Mallick's 4 percent
interest in the venture for $440,000 in the manner described above.
   Records received from Brammer Engineering reveal that throughout
the month of May 1988, Brammer kept trying to stimulate pressure in
the well and to turn the well into a profitable producer. However,
all of Brammer's efforts were unsuccessful. Brammer shut-in the
well on June 9, 1988, having spent $2,890,000 to drill and complete
the well; Brammer suspended all operations for almost two months.
...
   Brammer Engineering promptly decided to plug the original well
and the sidetrack well and to abandon the site. Plugging operations
were concluded on September 24, 1988; the drilling derrick and
barge were removed; and the site was abandoned on September 25,
1988. ...
   Regardless of the method used to value the well on May 10, 1988,
it seems clear that Michael Mallick's 4 percent interest was worth
a fraction of the $440,000 paid by URP. While the ``loan'' from URP
may well have been a gift to Michael Mallick or Mallightco, Inc.,
counsel could not conclude, based upon available evidence, that any
House rules were violated. During the entire time Mallightco, Inc.,
was involved in Sabine Lake, Representative Wright's ownership of
his Mallightco, Inc., stock was in a blind trust. Thus, Special
Outside Counsel could not say whether Representative Wright knew of
the Sabine Lake transaction, the URP loan, or of the great
disparity between the loan price and the value of the fractional
interest in the well; nor whether URP had a direct interest in
legislation. Accordingly, Special Outside Counsel recommended
further investigation into Mallightco's loan transaction with URP.
   The committee agreed with Special Outside Counsel that important
questions remain to be resolved regarding URP's transaction with
Mallightco, Inc., as well as the later transaction with
Representative Wright's Blind Trust. Available evidence suggests
that far too much money was paid by URP to acquire its interest in
the North Sabine Lake Prospect given that the well records indicate
an unsucessful venture. Accordingly, the committee has issued a
series of subpoenas to the relevant parties for the purpose of
obtaining the information necessary to resolve remaining questions.
The committee will take such additional action regarding
Mallightco, Inc.'s purchase and sale of its interest in the North
Sabine Lake Prospect, if the facts indicate there is reason to
believe violations occurred.

<BYLINE>Conclusion</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The foregoing discussion and explanation of the committee's
actions taken in connection with the Preliminary Inquiry into the
assertions raised against Representative Wright have been presented
pursuant to the committee's well-established policy to make full
public disclosure of the results of its investigative activities.
While, as discussed above, certain additional work will continue,
it is the committee's view that the foregoing statement will be
sufficient to explain why no further action has been taken in
connection with certain areas of the June 9, 1988, Preliminary
Inquiry. This statement also explains why a five-count Statement of
Alleged Violation covering 69 separate violations has been issued
to Representative Wright regarding those matters in which the
committee has determined that there is a reason to believe such
violations have occurred. Beyond this statement, the committee will
have no further disclosures of information or documents in this
matter except in accordance with the committee's Rules of Procedure.
   
   The foregoing explanatory statement and Statement of Alleged
Violation were agreed to by the committee on April 13, 1989, by a
vote of 12 ayes and 0 nays.

<HEAD>Delta Begins Rebuttal In Flight 191 Liability Suit Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZANNE GAMBOA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crash of Delta Flight 191 would
have been even more disastrous if the crew had aborted a landing
attempt because of wind shear, a witness for Delta Air Lines
testified Monday.
   Flight 191 crashed at Dallas-Fort Worth Interntational Airport
during a thunderstorm on Aug. 2, 1985, killing 136 people on board
and a motorist. Twenty-five people survived.
   Delta Air Lines sued the federal government in an attempt to
force it to help pay about $125 million in claims by victims'
relatives and $25 million for the cost of the L-1011 destroyed in
the crash.
   The non-jury liability trial, which recessed last month after
the government rested its case, resumed with Delta presenting
rebuttal witnesses.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has blamed the crash on
a microburst, a violent downward blast of air often associated with
severe thunderstorms.
   The government has contended that plane's crew should have tried
sooner to maneuver the jet out of the storm.
   But University of Texas-Arlington professor B. Robert Mullins
testified that if the crew had tried to abort its landing when it
encountered the violent wind shear, the jet would have crashed
sooner and fewer people would have survived.
   Mullins, who played a videotape simulating Delta's
interpretation of what the crew encountered before the crash,
denied government assertions that the crew forced the jet's nose
down when trying to come out of the wind shear.
   He said the plane's nose was forced down because a head wind
rapidly changed into a tail wind. ``This is what started the course
of events which eventually led to the accident,'' Mullins said.
   Delta contends that Federal Aviation Administration air traffic
controllers and National Weather Service meteorologists failed to
warn Flight 191's crew of the storm's severity.
   But the government has countered that the crew never sought
information about the storm and that the plane's weather radar
should have warned the pilots against flying into a large storm
cell.
   Throughout the trial, the government has criticized Delta crew
training and procedures, charging they have been inadequate for
years.
   The government has also tried to portray Flight 191 pilot Ted
Connors as a habitual user of the tranquilizer Stelazine.
   A Denver psychiatrist testified Monday that the amount of
Stelazine that Connors was taking was not enough to impair the
pilot's judgment. Dr. Frederick Lewis said he estimated from trial
transcripts that Connors took only 2 milligrams of the drug every
three days.
   The most frequent side effect of the Stelazine is a temporary
deterioration in motor abilities, Lewis said. ``There is absolutely
no evidence that Ted Connors had any of these side-effects,'' he
said.
   Lewis said Connors took the drug for jaw pain.
   Government attorneys pointed out that Lewis had never treated or
examined Connors and that it was impossible to tell how often
Connors took tranquilizers because the prescription directed him to
take them as needed.
   Delta's presentation of rebuttal testimony and evidence is
expected to continue through Wednesday. The government has the
option of rebutting or resting.
   U.S. District Judge David O. Belew said he hopes to have a
ruling in the lawsuit by Aug. 15.

   Nearly 2,000 students swarmed into central
Beijing's Tiananmen Square by bicycle and on foot before dawn
Tuesday and cheered demands that the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo resign.
   More than 1,500 students in Shanghai also took to the streets to
express grief over the death Saturday of former Communist Party
chief Hu Yaobang and to demand more democracy.
   Students marched in both cities Monday. They put up posters on
campus mourning Hu, a liberal reformist, and expressing vague
dissatisfaction with the government.
   A poster at Beijing University attacked senior leader Deng
Xiaoping for the first time, although not by name. It blamed the
84-year-old Deng for Hu's removal in 1987.
   The marches were the largest since the 1986-87 pro-democracy
demonstrations that led to Hu's forced resignation. Conservatives
accused Hu of being too liberal and failing to halt student
demonstrations.
   Tuesday's demonstrations brought the revived student movement
closer to a new political stage.
   Beijing students cheered when one speaker climbed on a monument
to China's revolutionary heroes and demanded that the 22-member
Politburo resign.
   They cheered a demand that party leaders reassess Hu's place in
history. It could not be determined how many demonstrators joined
in formulating the demands.
   Most students dispersed after reaching Tiananmen, but about 200
staged a sit-in before the Great Hall of the People, the national
seat of government next to the square.
   They presented six demands to the National People's Congress, or
parliament, including reassessment of Hu's role, opposition to
anti-liberal political campaigns, and disclosure of leaders'
incomes. They demanded freedom of speech and press, higher pay for
intellectuals, and lifting restrictions on street marches.
   The six demands did not include one for the Politburo's
resignation.
   An unidentified official received the demands but said they were
major matters that needed to be studied at length.
   The students sang the national anthem and the socialist
Internationale, chanted ``Long live democracy!'' and ``Oppose
dictatorship!'' and asked other students back on the campus to join
them.
   The four-hour march from campuses in northern Beijing to
Tiananmen had the atmosphere of a recreational outing.
   Students joked and laughed, and many said they didn't know what
they would do once they reached Tiananmen.
   ``We're going to honor the memory of Hu Yaobang,'' one said.
``We don't have any political goals.''
   Several said the march began spontaneously shortly after
midnight at Beijing University, which is China's leading university
and has a history of political activism. Students from other
schools joined the procession, along with some bystanders.
   Several students carrying a white sheet with the words ``China's
Spirit'' led the march.
   A few police stationed around the square made no attempt to
interfere.
   More than 600 students from Beijing's Political Science and Law
College marched to Tiananmen on Monday and placed two funeral
wreaths at the monument.
   In Shanghai, thousands of students from Fudan University
participated in marches that began Sunday.
   Jason Hurpado of Portland, Ore., an English teacher at Fudan,
said students sang revolutionary songs during the first march,
substituting Hu's name for that of revolutionary leader Mao
Tse-tung.
   This week's marches reflected not only grief at Hu's death but
also the volatility among students unhappy with living conditions
and bleak career prospects.
   The officially supervised Student Union at Beijing University,
in an apparent attempt to channel the students' emotions, set up a
temporary memorial hall honoring Hu. The Communist Party has said
an official memorial service will be held in the Great Hall of the
People, but no date has been set.
   Hu was eulogized by the party as a statesman and proletarian
revolutionary.

<HEAD>Dubcek Criticizes Former Hungarian Leader for Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, whose reform program
in Czechoslovakia was crushed by the Soviet-led invasion in 1968,
has denounced Hungary's former Communist Party leader for
supporting the intervention.
   Dubcek was removed as Czechoslovakia's Communist Party leader
after the invasion and remained out of public view for years.
Recently he has been commenting on the actions that ended his
reforms known as the ``Prague spring.''
   He criticized former Communist Party chief Janos Kadar in an
interview carried on the Hungarian television program ``Panorama.''
   It was believed to be the first time an interview with Dubcek
was broadcast by an official news channel in a Soviet-bloc country.
   The official MTI news agency on Monday carried excerpts of the
interview.
   MTI reported Dubcek said Kadar or Wladyslaw Gokmulka, Poland's
Communist Party leader in 1968, could have stopped the invasion by
refusing to participate.
   He was quoted as saying, ``I hoped that Kadar would finally say
no to the intervention ... or that Gomulka might have the strength
to do so.
   ``Kadar and Gomulka would have had to do their utmost because
they alone would have been able to prevent the intervention.''
   Romania was the only Warsaw Pact country that refused to take
part in the invasion.
   MTI reported Dubcek rejected claims by some of Kadar's
supporters that he agreed to support the Soviet invasion to protect
economic reforms being introduced in Hungary. The agency quoted
Dubcek as saying that because of the invasion the ``reform movement
slowed down for 20 years not only in Czechoslovakia but also in the
Soviet Union and Hungary.''
   MTI did not say where or when Dubcek was interviewed.
   Kadar, accused by some party officials of blocking Hungarian
reforms in the 1970s, was replaced by Karoly Grosz last May.
Gomulka was removed as Poland's party leader in 1970.
   In another development Monday, Hungary's Communist Party
repealed its decision to expell four leaders who had been accused
of harming party unity.
   The decision by the party's central control commission came two
days after some 600 communist reformers met in Kecskemet and some
speakers supported the idea of splitting away from the Communist
Party.
   Two of the four who were expelled a year ago, economist Laszlo
Lengyel and political scientist Mihaly Bihari, addressed the
Kecskemet meeting. The other two are parliamentarian Zoltan Kiraly
and Zoltan Biro, who last month was elected to the presidium of the
Democratic Forum.
   All four have been associated with the Democratic Forum, a
reform organization established in September 1987. It has become
one of the most influential of dozens of independent movements in
Hungary.
   It was not known if the four would decide to rejoin the
Communist Party now that Kadar has been removed.

<HEAD>F. Wright's Possible Exercise of Undue Influence in Dealing With
Officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In early 1986, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (the ``Bank
Board''), perceiving worsening conditions in the Southwest's
economy and thrift industry, began a massive examination of almost
all the savings and loan associations in District 9, which included
associations in Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, and
Mississippi. As a result, the Bank Board discovered that many
associations, especially those in Texas where state regulations
were especially permissive, were built on risky investments,
uncollectible loans and fraudulent appraisals. While the real
estate market was booming, these associations appeared to be doing
well. However, when the bottom dropped out of the Texas real estate
market, the Bank Board's examinations showed that much of the
profit had been imaginary.
   The burgeoning number of savings and loan failures in Texas and
elsewhere placed enormous strains on the FSLIC fund, which insures
deposits in federal and state-chartered savings and loan
associations. Under federal law, when FSLIC places an insolvent
federally-insured savings association into a receivership, it must
pay off the insured depositors almost immediately. Therefore, each
closure requires FSLIC to make an immediate cash outlay
approximately equal to the insolvent association's deposits. As
FSLIC's reserves dwindled, it lost the financial ability to close
even the most insolvent associations. In late 1986, approximately
250 associations required FSLIC assistance. Of these, FSLIC
considered 130 associations, with stated assets of $47.6 billion,
to be severely troubled.
   In response to this crisis, in May 1986 a bill was introduced in
the House of Representatives which provided, among other items, $15
billion in new funds for FSLIC without the use of general revenues.
The bill was referred to the House committee on Banking, Finance
and Urban Affairs, which passed the bill by a vote of 47 to 1
without significant amendment. The bill was placed on the
suspension calendar and was scheduled for consideration by the full
House on Monday, September 29, 1986. (The suspension calendar is
reserved for bills engendering little controversy.) However, Wright
removed it from the calendar prior to its consideration. The bill
was rescheduled on October 6, 1986 and on October 7, 1986 it passed
the House under suspension of the rules. However, because the
Senate's version of the bill contained controversial provisions,
insufficient time remained to resolve the differences before
Congress adjourned on October 18, 1986.
   On January 6, 1987, substantially the same bill was reintroduced
in the new Congress. The Banking Committee held hearings later in
January as members began increasingly to pass along complaints
about regulators' ``arbitrary'' actions in closing down savings and
loan associations. For the first time, ``forbearance'' provisions,
i.e., provisions restricting FSLIC's ability to close associations,
were discussed as part of the bill. Wright supported these
forbearance provisions as well as a reduction in the
recapitalization amount to $5 billion. The Bank Board believed the
forbearance provisions and the reduced recapitalization amount
would severely hamper its ability to deal with the crisis. Although
Wright later supported $15 billion, the House passed the
recapitalization bill at the $5 billion level. The amount was
raised to $10.8 billion in conference and the forbearance
provisions were weakened. The bill was signed into law in August
1987.
   During this 1986-1987 period, Wright intervened with the Bank
Board on behalf of four Texas businessmen who were deeply embroiled
in the savings and loan crisis. One of these businessmen, Craig
Hall, met with Wright on September 2, 1986 and informed him that
the Bank Board was out of control and taking action against him
which would have serious repercussions in the Dallas and Texas
communities.
   Hall is a Dallas-based real estate syndicator and one of the
largest owners of real estate in Texas. Once Hall determined that
the worsening Texas economy threatened his ability to remain
current on loans held by numerous savings and loan associations, he
sought assistance from the Bank Board and District Banks in
restructuring his debts held by FSLIC-controlled savings and loans.
   Although the Bank Board was not adverse to the concept of a
global restructuring, it believed it could not legally assume the
role of negotiator for those associations involved in the Hall
restructuring which were already under FSLIC control. Hall was
required to negotiate individual agreements with the Special
Representatives of each FSLIC-controlled association.
   Hall was able to reach agreement with all but one
FSLIC-controlled association, the Westwood Savings and Loan of Los
Angeles, which held approximately $200 million in Hall loans.
Westwood's Bank Board-appointed Special Representative, Scott
Schultz, and its outside counsel refused to accept conditions to
the restructuring which were adverse to Westwood's interests and
decided to foreclose on Hall's properties and allow him to go
bankrupt rather than accept his restructuring plan.
   At the onset of foreclosure proceedings, the Bank Board and
District Banks ceased communication with Hall. Hall told Wright in
their September 2, 1986 meeting that he had received no response to
his efforts to re-establish communication with the Bank Board and
District Banks. Soon after meeting with Hall, Wright called a
meeting in his office with several Texas congressmen and
representatives of the Bank Board, including its Chairman, Edwin
Gray. Although Hall may have been mentioned, the meeting was
generally devoted to passing along reports that Bank Board
regulators were mistreating Texas savings and loans.
   Wright called Gray shortly after the meeting to complain about
Westwood's Special Representative, Scott Schultz, whom Wright said
was not as flexible or understanding as he might be. Wright asked
if there was not anything Gray could do about that situation.
Wright never discussed the merits of the Bank Board's position and
he rebuffed the Bank Board's offer to explain its position in the
Hall matter.
   Gray decided to further investigate the Hall matter. On Friday,
September 26, 1986, Bank Board Chief of Staff Shannon Fairbanks
went to a meeting with Hall and his California savings and loan
creditors. On that day, Hall learned that because of Wright's
interest in Hall's situation, Wright had placed a ``hold'' on the
FSLIC recapitalization bill which had been scheduled for
consideration by the House on the following Monday.
   Gray and Fairbanks thus determined that if they were to obtain a
recapitalization bill, they would have to facilitate a
restructuring of Hall's loans. On September 29, 1986, Gray replaced
Scott Schultz with another Special Representative who was
instructed to disregard outside couunsel's legal advice and
determine if there was any way to build a responsible economic case
in support of renegotiating Hall's loans. Following Gray's removal
of Schultz, and Gray's later assurances to Wright that the Bank
Board would not treat Texas savings and loans unfairly, the bill
was returned to the House calendar. It was passed by the full House
under a suspension of the rules on October 7, 1986.

   The House ethics committee, with Democrats and
Republicans united, formally charged Speaker Jim Wright Monday with
69 violations of the chamber's rules including what the panel's
chairman called ``a scheme to evade'' limits on outside earnings.
   After a 10-month, $1.5 million investigation, the committee of
six Democrats and six Republicans voted unanimously to issue a
report finding ``reason to believe'' the Texas Democrat had run
afoul of House rules requiring reporting of gifts, barring
acceptance of gifts from persons with a direct interest in
legislation and limiting outside earned income.
   ``I know in my heart I have not violated any of the rules of
that institution,'' Wright said in a speech to a labor meeting
shortly after the ethics report was released.
   He said he had asked ``very urgently, very earnestly'' for a
quick meeting with the the committee ``to confront them, to
confront the allegations head-on, face-to-face.''
   While scandal has tainted other House speakers, Wright is the
first ever to be formally charged with ethical wrongdoing.
   At a news conference, committee chairman Rep. Julian Dixon,
D-Calif., emphasized that Wright is presumed innocent until the
charges are proven, and he underscored that proving them requires a
much heavier weight of evidence than the step taken Monday, which
is the panel's equivalent of an indictment.
   The move set in motion a series of steps in which Wright can
defend himself and the panel try to prove with ``clear and
convincing'' evidence that the violations occurred. That is likely
ultimately to throw the matter before the full House, where
Wright's position as the nation's highest elected Democrat could be
on the line.
   Possible punishments range from a reprimand to expulsion from
the House, although lawmakers in both parties seemed to think the
final decision would come down to whether Wright should be
reprimanded or simply chastised for poor judgment and let off
without formal punishment.
   Wright immediately began his defense in earnest, operating what
one supporter, Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, called ``a war room''
out of the speaker's office. ``At some point we've got to start
figuring out who's on our side and who's on the other side,''
Wilson said.
   Wilson predicted Wright would win on the floor, ``losing a few
cowardly Democrats and picking up some brave Republicans.''
   The most serious allegation against Wright _ that Fort Worth
developer George Mallick, from whom he accepted $145,000 in gifts
over a 10-year period, had a direct interest in legislation _ also
had the narrowest margin of support on the ethics committee.
   According to records of internal committee votes released along
with the report of the panel's special outside counsel, Chicago
attorney Richard J. Phelan, Democrats Chester Atkins of
Massachusetts and Bernard Dwyer of New Jersey joined the six
committee Republicans for an 8 to 4 margin on that issue.
   The panel agreed with its counsel, Phelan, that Mallick's major
interests in real estate and oil and gas ventures and in
redevelopment of Fort Worth's historic stockyards district gave him
a direct interest in legislation on taxation and on certain
appropriations bills. His financing arrangements with savings and
loan institutions also gave him an interest in legislation
involving the S&amp;L industry, the committee found.
   But Wright's lawyer, William C. Oldaker, called that
``doublespeak'' and said ``it's one of the most outrageous readings
of legislative history'' he has seen. Overall, the report contains
``a lot of noise, a lot of clamoring, but very little substance,''
he said.
   Other matters before the committee were more clear cut. The
panel voted unanimously that there was reason to believe Wright
failed to report as gifts the use of a car and Fort Worth
condominium he and his wife received from Mallick. Committee
members voted 10-2 that Mrs. Wright's $18,000-a-year salary from a
Mallick-Wright company should also be characterized as a gift,
saying she did little or nothing to earn the money.
   The panel also voted 10-2 that certain bulk sales of Wright's
book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' appeared to have been used
to evade House ceilings on outside earned income.
   ``In the committee's view, seven bulk sales of Rep. Wright's
book ... demonstrated an overall scheme to evade the House outside
earned income limit because (speaking) honorarium payments were
recharacterized as royalties,'' Dixon said.
   The committee voted unanimously to issue its statement of
alleged violation formally charging the speaker with breaking the
rules.
   Forty-seven possible violations raised by Phelan were dismissed.
Those involved allegations of improper lobbying of executive branch
officials, misuse of congressional staff and misuse of campaign
funds.
   Republicans were largely holding their fire Monday, aware that
any attack could help Wright paint the investigation _ prompted
last June by a complaint from Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. _ as a
partisan matter.
   ``No Republican is attacking Jim Wright,'' said Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind. ``This is a bipartisan report of the ethics committee. We
are taking a wait-and-see attitude. We will serve as a jury. Let's
not make this partisan.''
   But another GOP lawmaker, Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota, said the
committee's release of its findings demonstrated that ``the charges
are not trivial, they are not technical, they are not aimed at his
wife,'' as Wright contended last week. ``These are serious, serious
questions, and $145,000 is a lot of money.''
   The report said that Mallightco, a small investment company
formed by Wright, Mallick and their wives, paid Mrs. Wright's
salary even though it often had to borrow money from Mallick's own
company to do so. Mallightco was little more than ``a conduit for
cash flowing from the Mallicks to the Wrights,'' the report stated.
   On one issue, the panel could not reach a conclusion and said it
would investigate further. That involved the purchase by Mallightco
of an interest in an oil and gas well known as the Sabine Lake
Prospect.
   For an initial investment of $9,120, the partnership bought a 4
percent interest on May 10, 1988. The well struck oil but soon
played out, and on June 9, was shut down. Despite the results, a
Texas petroleum investment corporation, Union Rheinische Petroleum
Inc., offered $440,000 for Mallightco's share on May 10, boosting
the value of Mallitco at a time when Wright's blind trust was
selling its interest.
   An independent appraisal of the interest in the Sabine Lake
Prospect put its value at $69,000 to $169,000, far less than Union
Rheinische offered.

   Wright did not merely ``urge prompt consideration'' of or
``express judgment'' on the Hall matter as specifically permitted
in the Select Committee on Ethics' Advisory Opinion No. 1. He
removed the recapitalization bill from House consideration in order
to pressure the Bank Board into changing its resolution of the Hall
matter regardless of the merits of the Bank Board's position. Such
pressure is a violation of House Rule XLIII, clause 1, as
interpreted by Advisory Opinion No. 1.
   On October 6, 1986, Wright met with J. Scott Mann III, an
Austin, Texas savings and loan operator who complained that the
Bank Board was discriminating against Texas savings and loans
associations and that a recapitalized FSLIC would close large
numbers of Texas institutions. Mann also set forth his complaints
in a letter of October 7, 1986 which Wright forwarded to Gray
asking that he check on the situations described. Gray investigated
Mann's charges and reported to Wright that Mann's CreditBanc
Savings had committed serious regulatory violations and was in a
precarious financial condition. Wright took no further action. Thus
Wright's request that Gray check on Mann's charges is within the
guidelines of Advisory Opinion No. 1 which expressly provides that
it is appropriate for a member to request information or a status
report.
   In early November 1986, Wright telephoned Gray regarding
Wright's ``friend'' Thomas M. Gaubert of Independent American
Savings Association, a Texas-chartered association with its main
office in Irving, Texas. Gaubert was also a contributor to the
Democratic Party and treasurer of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
   In January 1986, Gaubert had been permanently removed from
Independent American and prohibited from operating any
FSLIC-insured association. Gaubert had been involved in
questionable transactions at an Iowa savings and loan as well as
regulatory violations and unsafe or unsound practices at
Independent American. As of November 30, 1986, Independent American
had a negative net worth of $454 million. Although Gaubert entered
into a written agreement removing him from the industry, he later
argued that he had been misled and treated unfairly and, therefore,
that the agreement was invalid.
   Wright asked Gray to meet with Gaubert personally in order to
get Gaubert's side of the story. Gray protested that Bank Board
rules prohibit the Chairman from meeting with parties to actions
before the Board. Despite Gray's protests, Wright insisted that
Gray meet with Gaubert; Gray did so as an accommodation to Wright.
Following his meeting with Gaubert, Gray made the unprecedented
decision in January or February 1987 to appoint an independent
counsel (selected by counsel for Gaubert) to determine whether the
Bank Board had in fact wrongfully removed Gaubert from Independent
American. Gray testified that but for his perception of Wright's
influence on the recapitalization bill, he would not have appointed
independent counsel. Independent counsel ultimately determined that
the Bank Board had not violated any statutes or regulations in its
treatment of Gaubert, although it did note some instances of
improper or unfair behavior, none of which justified Gaubert's
claim that he was removed improperly.
   Nonetheless, despite the significant concessions made by Gray,
at a meeting with officials of the Bank Board and FHLB-Dallas on
February 10, 1987 in Wright's office, Wright made it plain that he
viewed the outcome of the Gaubert matter to have been extremely
unsatisfactory. The clear inference is that Wright was not simply
seeking impartial consideration of Gaubert's claim, but a change in
the Bank Board's regulatory response to Gaubert. Such use of
Wright's influence is a violation of House Rule XLIII, clause 1 as
interpreted by Advisory Opinion No. 1.
   In December 1986, Congressman Tony Coelho called Wright's aide,
John Mack, and requested Wright's assistance on behalf of Don R.
Dixon of Vernon Savings and Loan in Dallas and Vernon, Texas.
Coelho informed Mack that the FSLIC was going to shut down Vernon
that day. He asked that Wright attempt to get Dixon a grace period
as Dixon said he had a willing buyer.
   Mack testified that following his conversation with Coelho, he
told Wright of Dixon's problem. Wright telephoned Gray and asked
him whether Vernon was being closed down. Gray responded that
closing an institution requires a Bank Board meeting and he had not
authorized any such meeting. Wright asked Gray to find out if
anything was happening and to call John Mack with the information.
Gray later informed Mack that Vernon was not being ``shut down,''
but the FHLB-Dallas supervisory agents were going to seek a
``consent to merger agreement'' from Vernon's directors at the end
of December 1986. Gray explained that such an agreement would not
affect the association's ability to find an investor and that Mack
should let the Bank Board know if an investor were found.
Ultimately, no investor was found and Vernon was placed in
receivership in March 1987.
   In this instance, since Wright merely asked for information from
the Bank Board, no violation occurred.
   In November 1986, Wright again called Gray to express his
concern about the way Texas institutions were being treated by the
Bank Board. He brought up the subject of H. Joe Selby, the Director
of Regulatory Affairs at the FHLB-Dallas and formerly the acting
Comptroller of the Currency, who had the reputation of being a
tough regulator and who had been brought into the savings and loan
crisis by Gray to implement the Bank Board's supervisory and
regulatory response. Because of his hardline posture, Selby was
feared and distrusted by many in the thirft industry.
   Wright told Gray he understood from unnamed sources that Selby
was a homosexual who was sending all of FHLB-Dallas' work to a
``ring of homosexual lawyers in Texas.'' Wright asked Gray if there
was anything Gray could do to ``get rid of'' Selby. Gray refused
Wright's request and defended Selby as a highly competent regulator
doing the tough job expected of him.
   Although unsuccessful, Wright's attempt to destroy Selby's
career based upon such an accusation violates House rule XLIII,
clause 1, because it does not reflect creditably on the House.
   Similarly, when in late 1987 or early 1988 Wright's aide, Phil
Duncan, called Carl Hoyle, the Bank Board's Director of
Congressional Affairs and said he wanted William Black fired from
the staff of the FHLB-San Francisco, such a request indirectly from
Wright is also a violation of House Rule XLIII, clause 1.
   Thus, as discussed in full in Section III. F. of this Report,
Wright committed four violations of House Rule XLIII, clause 1, as
interpreted by Advisory Opinion No. 1.

   U.S. authorities Monday arrested the
son of the owner of a Mexican ranch where human sacrifice was
performed by a drug-smuggling cult suspected in 15 killings.
   Serafin Hernandez Rivera Sr. of Brownsville was one of three men
charged in federal warrants Monday with marijuana importation,
possession and conspiracy. The other two were Martin Quintana and
Mario Fabio, both Mexicans.
   Authorities believe Quintana and Fabio took part in the
sacrificial slaying and mutilation of University Texas student Mark
Kilroy, who disappeared while vacationing at the border during
spring break, Neck said.
   The two were among six suspects who remained at large, and were
considered dangerous, Neck said.
   Hernandez, the fifth suspect arrested in the case, was
apprehended at a Houston residence by U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration and Texas Department of Public Safety agents, said
Oran Neck, chief U.S. Customs agent here.
   Meanwhile, the hunt for Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, and Sara
Maria Aldrete, 24, believed to be the cult's ringleaders, shifted
back to Mexico after authorities received information they had gone
to Mexico City intending to go to Miami from there, Neck said.
   ``There might be one or two other subjects with them,'' Neck
said, declining to elaborate.
   Constanzo is a Cuban-American who has lived in Miami, and
Aldrete is a Texas college student who authorities said lived a
double life as the ``witch'' of the cult.
   Hernandez' father, Brigido Hernandez, owns Rancho Santa Elena
near Matamoros, Mexico, where human sacrifices allegedly took
place. Brigido Hernandez has not been charged in the slayings.
   The Hernandez family has a long history of drug smuggling, Neck
said. Serafin Hernandez is the brother of Elio Hernandez Rivera, 22
_ considered one of the top cult figures _ and the father of
Serafin Hernandez Garcia, 20.
   Both Elio Hernandez Rivera and Serafin Hernandez Garcia were in
custody in Matamoros. The younger Serafin Hernandez is suspected of
drug activities but was not believed to have taken part in cult
activities.
   The filing of federal Mexican charges against those two and two
other susepcts in custody in Matamoros was delayed Monday by the
discovery the day before of two bodies near the ranch, where 13
mutilated corpses were found last week.
   The bodies of two suspected drug traffickers missing since May
were unearthed Sunday on a collective farm two miles south of the
Rancho Santa Elena.
   The two victims, Moises Castillo, 52, of Houston and Hector de
la Fuente, 39, who lived on a small communal farm west of
Matamoros, did not appear to have been tortured or mutilated like
the others, officials said.
   The new deaths complicated the case, said Jose Piedad Silva
Arroyo, Mexico's chief federal narcotics investigator for
northeastern Tamaulipas state.
   Silva said authorities were considering adding the latest
victims' deaths to the murder, kidnapping, drug and weapons charges
already pending against the four suspects.
   Although relatives disputed the description, officials said the
two newly found victims were drug dealers somehow involved with the
cult.
   Castillo's 76-year-old father, Hidalgo Castillo of Brownsville,
helped police dig up his son's body. He said he first suspected his
son might be buried at the communal farm after children told him
they saw something suspicious there.
   ``They said, `Look over there. There's a hand sticking out of
the ground,''' Castillo said.
   Across the Rio Grande in Brownsville, Cameron County Sheriff
Alex Perez described the two newly discovered deaths as
drug-related, ``revenge-type killings.''
   At least three of the 13 victims found earlier have also been
said to be tied to the group by the drug business.
   The suspects in custody have told investigators that cult
members were involved in occult practices inspired by palo mayombe,
a form of spiritism that draws on African and Caribbean influences.
   The suspects also said that they were encouraged by Aldrete to
watch the movie ``The Believers,'' which deals with people
practicing palo mayombe.
   Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete, charged with aggravated kidnapping by
Cameron County authorities, are believed to have directed the human
sacrifices, mutilations and boiling of brains and other organs in
rituals to bring occult protection for their drug-smuggling ring.
   Numerous people have called to report sightings of the pair,
said Cameron County Sheriff's Lt. George Gavito said.

   Artist-photographer Sergei Petrov said Monday he
was being allowed to leave the Soviet Union after being refused
permission to emigrate for eight years and that he hoped to go to
the United States this week.
   The 36-year-old Petrov said in a telephone interview that he had
tried since 1981 to join his American wife, Virginia Johnson, but
was turned down for reasons of state security.
   Now, he said, ``I have my passport in my hand.''
   Petrov said he received notification from the Soviet visa office
in Sunday's mail and picked up his external passport Monday. He
said he filed repeated invitations for visits to America with the
visa office long ago and that ``they just picked one.''
   He replied when asked why he now was being granted permission to
leave: ``I will never know. I think the reason is all the joint
effort of the U.S. Embassy, the State Department, and other
countries like the Netherlands and Australia. But mostly it was the
State Department's pressure.''
   Petrov's photographs were put on display at the State Department
late last year and his case has been a priority human rights case
pursued by Washington.
   He said he will go to the United States ``as soon as I can,
sometime this week,'' but that his plans were not certain.
   The photographer said former U.S. Ambassador Arthur Hartman and
his wife Donna worked especially hard on his case.
   Petrov said he was told before he began working in an
electronics laboratory in 1977 that he would not be allowed to
leave the Soviet Union for five years. He left the laboratory after
three months, but officials continued to refuse permission to
emigrate for years after.
   In December he was refused permission when authorities allowed
his 71-year-old mother Klavdia to go to the United States for
medical treatment. She is in Washington, D.C.

   A soccer-mad city poured out its grief
for 94 dead at two of its prominent shrines _ the modern Roman
Catholic cathedral and the home field of Liverpool football club.
   In the early hours today, people were still coming to the main
gate of Anfield Road stadium, converging on a 100-foot expanse of
steel fence and gate covered with clusters of flowers, club
banners, scarves and hats.
   ``They only wanted to see their heroes ... '' began one long
epitaph taped to the fence honoring Liverpool fans who died in a
human crush Saturday at Hillsborough stadium 65 miles away in
Sheffield.
   At the gate, a memorial to legendary manager Bill Shankly
adorned with the motto ``You Will Never Walk Alone,'' a man and
woman stood locked together in love and grief, barely moving for
more than half an hour while the woman's sobbing never ceased.
   At the Metropolitan Cathedral, which was filled to overflowing
for an ecumenical requiem Mass, the red banner of Liverpool
Football Club stood near the altar.

   Internal Revenue Service spokesman Frank Keith said the IRS had

   The deadline is one day later in New England and most of upstate

   Hawaii in 1974 became the first state in the nation to adopt a

Massachusetts.
   This year, California, Florida, Illinois, Ohio and other states

   Americans overwhelmingly believe that outlawing
abortion would do little to curtail it, and half want the operation
to remain legal and unrestricted in early pregnancies, a poll has
found.
   Up to 65 percent of the 1,108 adults questioned in the Media
General-Associated Press poll supported legalized abortion in other
contexts.
   The poll also found broad opposition to Operation Rescue, whose
members have been blocking entrances to abortion clinics around the
country.
   With the U.S. Supreme Court poised to reconsider its 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion during the first three
months of pregnancy, 53 percent in the random-sample survey said
they favored that landmark ruling.

   He also staged an interview with dead conductor Wilhelm

Record Shelf.'' He also hosts a daily classical music show on KUSC
in Los Angeles.
   After 10 years at the station, he has become a valuable property.
   ``He is just what radio thrives on, and that is a real radio
personality,'' said station President Wallace A. Smith. ``He's
extremely quirky.''
   In his wry delivery that sounds a bit like a lockjawed,
satin-voiced Edward G. Robinson, Svejda explores historical
recordings, recent releases, the little-known, the underappreciated
and, indeed, the quirky.
   A piece on fat singers was described by Svejda in the program
guide as, ``There's More of Them to Love: A High-Cholesterol
Tribute to the Century's Largest Singers.'' A show on operatic
ingenues was called, ``Not Much Upstairs, But What a Staircase.''
   In another program, Svejda settled on Bruckner as the ugliest
composer: ``a dirty golfball, which, when it smiled, which wasn't
often, suggested a badly opened beer can.''
   Underlying his approach seem to be two principles: decry
mediocrity and never sanctify the art.
   ``Classical music is human,'' he said in a recent interview from
KUSC. ``You read Mozart's letters and they are unpublishable.''
   Svejda's opinions are publishable, though maybe just barely. His
book listing favorite recordings, ``The Record Shelf Guide,'' was
published last year.
   Of composer Philip Glass, he writes: ``a very nice man who has
gotten very rich not by underestimating, but by completely ignoring
his audience's intelligence.'' Conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt is an
``incompetent bozo.'' Tenor Luciano Pavarotti, once great, has
become a ``vulgar sot.''
   Of course, since this is a book of Svejda's favorites, most of
the adjectives are glowing.
   In his comments literary and spoken, Svejda almost seems to be
waging a campaign against Karajan, though he says that is not
intentional.
   ``He's repulsive,'' said Svejda, referring to the conductor's
membership in the Nazi party and success under Hitler. ``I think
he's a symptom of what's happened since the war, the new anonymity,
although he does have a distinctive personality. He turns
everything into mush.''
   Gone, too, are the days when hearing five measures could
identify an orchestra.
   ``I don't think it's too far-fetched to say it's a lot like
airports,'' said Svejda. ``One guy flies in for two weeks, another
guy flies in for two weeks.''
   Conductors in Svejda's favor include Leonard Bernstein, Simon
Rattle, Carlo Maria Giulini, Carlos Kleiber, Michael Tilson Thomas
and Klaus Tennstedt.
   ``They say as much about themselves as they do about the piece,
which is now disreputable.''
   Jet flying has also brought on ``the dark ages'' of opera, as
singers burn out their voices globe-hopping between performances,
he said.
   ``It's very depressing. I like opera, but I hate to see it
dying.''
   Svejda said he never provoked complaints from performers or
composers he has skewered, but some listeners have responded
angrily, according to Smith.
   Some are outraged when Svejda criticizes their favorite
composers. Another, during a request program, was ``deeply offended
when Jim made the comment about a piece requested as being a `piece
of junk,''' said Smith. Other listeners were angered by Svejda's
title for a program on homosexual composers, ``The Third Sex.''
   Svejda, who majored in philosophy at the University of Michigan,
said he never doubts his critical conclusions.
   ``I don't think it's arrogance. After a certain amount of time,
a certain amount of experience, you develop an ear. Of course, your
glands tell you a lot,'' he said.
   ``The fact that he really has no regard for anybody who is
living is a modest affirmation of how deadly serious he is,'' Smith
said.
   Svejda also has a profound side. Answering his own question,
``What is music good for?'' at the conclusion of one program, he
said:
   ``It's a little like asking, what are we good for? A startlingly
similar question, as it turns out, since the answer, whatever it
is, amounts to almost the same thing.''

<HEAD>Youth Center to Teach Nazi Horrors Planned for Dachau</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After eight years of sometimes
bitter controversy, Bavarian leaders are planning a youth center in
Dachau to help teach younger generations of the Nazi horrors that
occurred in its notorious concentration camp.
   But deep philosophical differences remain over just how the
center will pass on its bitter lessons.
   Politicians here in highly conservative Bavaria want the youth
center to be under governmental control. They envision it as a
youth hostel that would combine instruction about the Nazis with a
chance to learn about the modern-day city of Dachau.
   On the other side, an association that has members in several
countries argues that the leadership of the center should reflect
more diverse views and be more international in scope.
   The Association for a Dachau International Youth Meeting Center
says the guest house should serve almost exclusively as a forum to
analyze the Nazi past and its implications today.
   Juergen Zarusky, a leader of the association, said he sees
dangers in government control.
   ``That means everything must be under government protection, so
that the past will be presented as a formal history lesson,''
Zarusky said in an interview. ``Both the personal impact and the
search for meaning for today won't be presented as strongly.''
   Zarusky, a 30-year-old doctoral candidate in modern history
who's lived in Dachau for three years, said his group feels
unfairly excluded from the project because local conservatives fear
``this could go in a leftist direction.''
   The concentration camp site, including a museum and memorials to
the dead, already attracts about a million visitors a year,
two-thirds of them foreigners. The site also contains watch towers,
barbed wire fences, a reconstructed barracks and the crematorium
where the dead were once burned.
   Dachau, which is about five miles north of Munich, was the first
of a string of Nazi concentration camps that became centers mainly
for the extermination of Jews, mostly in gas chambers, in World War
II.
   Official Nazi records say that 206,000 prisoners were kept at
Dachau, although the actual number is believed to be much higher.
   Nazi records say that nearly 32,000 prisoners died there, but
thousands of other deaths were not registered.
   The Nazis set up the concentration camp at Dachau two months
after seizing power Jan. 30, 1933. Its prisoners included Jews,
Communists, Social Democrats, clergymen and other opponents of the
Nazi regime.
   Bavarian officials opened the camp as a memorial in 1965, after
agreeing to cooperate with the Brussels-based International Dachau
Committee in supervising the site. The committee, made up of former
Dachau prisoners, has representatives on the board of trustees of
the association that wants an international youth center.
   The association was formed in 1984, after three years of efforts
by a local committee to establish a place where young people could
meet and spend the night.
   The plans ran into vehement opposition from the conservative
Christian Social Union officials at Dachau's city hall. They
repeatedly have maintained that such a center would unfairly a
create ``an extra burden'' on a city already saddled with a
notorious past.
   In 1987, members of the state parliament in Munich filed several
motions, seeking to take the matter out of local hands as a way to
find a solution.
   As a result, the Bavarian Education Ministry this past September
approved a plan for creating the youth center with sleeping
accommodations for about 100 people, as well as meeting rooms, for
both West Germans and foreigners.
   ``The youth guest house should contribute to enabling and
promoting a discussion of the past that is linked to the spirit of
democratic responsibility,'' the Education Ministry said.
   In its proposal for Dachau, however, the Education Ministry
called for the exclusion of events focusing on ``day-to-day
politics.''
   The ministry's Manfred Heger, who is handling the project, said
the guest house is supposed to be ``multi-functional.''
   ``It isn't supposed to be set up exclusively for instruction
about the camp memorial, the concentration camp site, Nazism and
fascism.''
   The Association for a Dachau International Youth Meeting Center
has rejected the government plan and continues to push for its own
ideas, including a greater reliance on former prisoners to narrate
their horrifying experiences.
   Gabi Hendl, another leading member of the association, brushes
aside objections that the center could damage the city's reputation.
   ``This youth meeting center is a chance for Dachau and the
people who live in the city to hear what young people from other
countries are thinking,'' said the 24-year-old Ms. Hendl, a member
of the leftist-leaning Social Democratic Party.
   Another member of the association is Nikolaus Lehner, 65, a Jew
who survived Dachau.
   ``We aren't politicizing,'' he said. ``We're discussing
history.''

<HEAD>Cemetery of Ancient Phoenicians Uncovered in Northern Israel</HEAD>

   Archaeologists have unearthed an ancient
cemetery in northern Israel and say the 3,000-year-old finds
indicate the Phoenicians were landlubbers before they went to sea
and dominated the Mediterranean.
   The Phoenicians emerged about 1,000 B.C. and established
city-states throughout the Mediterranean Basin from Lebanon to
Spain, surviving until Roman times.
   Pottery, jewelry and other remains of their cities show a
variety of influences from Greek cultures in the Aegean as well as
ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.
   But little is known of the origins of the ancient Phoenicians.
   Evidence uncovered by a Hebrew University team in the tombs at
Achziv near Israel's border with Lebanon point to a Semitic
background, either from the ancient land of Israel, also known as
Canaan, or further inland.
   The team declined to give a specific location of the cemetery
for fear of plunderers; they believe artifacts and gold may be
buried in the tombs.
   Elat Mazar, an archaeologist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem,
said the architecture of the tombs carved into the bedrock linked
the early Phoenicians to the ancient Hittites, a Semitic people who
lived in what is now Turkey and Syria and had no significant
sailing tradition.
   ``We found a hole in the ceiling on the tomb which is
characteristic of Hittite burial chambers,'' she said. ``In their
cult of the dead, it was a symbolic link between the living world
and the world of the dead.''
   She added that the Phoenicians had a sophisicated society with
advanced sailing technology, refined tastes in jewelry and an
unparalled ability to adapt material from other cultures.
   ``There is no question they were more developed than the
Israelite culture of the time. They were Semitic and close to the
Israelites but different.''
   The pack-rat characteristic of borrowing from neighboring
societies made the Phoenicians something of a mystery, however.
   Patricia Smith, a British-born anthropologist and dentist
interviewed at her laboratory in Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital,
said a study of the ancient human remains show the physical
features of the Phoenicians were Semitic.
   ``This was no Greek,'' said Ms. Smith, turning the skull of a
Phoenician and pointing to the wide skull, arch of the nose and the
high cheekbones. A cast of an Israelite skull from the same eighth
to seventh century B.C. period had similar features.
   From his teeth, Smith deduced that the man, 45 to 50 years old
when he died, suffered either from fever or hunger in his infancy
but was quite fit as an adult, with not a single tooth cavity.
   ``Apart from this hole in his head, he was very healthy,'' Smith
said of the Phoenician, who died of a powerful blow to the back of
his head, apparently struck by a heavy blunt instrument.
   The Israeli expedition unearthed about 50 skeletons from two
cave tombs measuring about 10 feet by 10 feet. The cemetery covers
seven acres and may contain the remains of thousands of Phoenicians
spanning almost the entire 1,000-year life of their society here.
   Ms. Smith said she hoped to use the remains, especially the
skulls, to recreate the general ``Phoenician look.''
   ``It will be very exiting to find out who the Phoenicians were.''
   Ms. Smith uses video cameras and still photography to recreate
faces. She employed the technique on behalf of the prosecution in
the trial of John Demjanjuk, a Cleveland, Ohio, autoworker
convicted last year in Israel of Nazi war crimes and sentenced to
death.
   She made a video that superimposed a recent video image of
Demjanjuk on a 40-year-old Nazi identity card to show it was the
same man.
   With the Phoenicians, she plans to use the same technique to
superimpose video images from ancient drawings of Phoenicians and
modern sketches over the skulls themselves.
   ``I would be able to define a type, but not an individual. We
should be able to tell how varied the Phoenicians were,'' she said,
explaining that a perfect re-creation was impossible without
knowing the features of soft tissue such as eyelids, ears and lips.

<HEAD>Israeli Rabbi Group Monitors West Bank Human Rights Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two bearded rabbis recently slipped under the
cover of night into an occupied West Bank village to question
residents about allegations of Israeli troop brutality during an
army-imposed curfew.
   They are members of the new Rabbinic Human Rights Watch, which
is gaining prominence among the growing number of Israeli groups
monitoring abuses in the occupied territories.
   Membership has swelled from a handful of rabbis a few months ago
to 75 rabbis embracing all streams of Judaism _ the Orthodox,
Conservative and Reform movements.
   The group's first action was to survey community health care in
several West Bank villages, then write to Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin complaining that medical treatment was being ``used as a
means of political pressure on the population.''
   ``It was immediately published in the papers and we said, `We as
rabbis have the power.' We have credibility as Jewish leaders who
first of all think of the moral side,'' said the U.S.-born chairman
of the group, Rabbi David Forman.
   The group has since monitored the Palestinian village of Batir,
three miles outside Jerusalem.
   In early April, one day before a group of rabbis was to have
visited Batir, the army clamped a curfew on the village in
retaliation for a stone-throwing attack on a train.
   Four days later, Forman and another rabbi, Yermiyahu Milgrom,
slipped into Batir at night to hear the villagers' complaints.
   Their report of alleged troop brutality, including beatings and
verbal abuse, was submitted to Rabin and was carried in the Israeli
press.
   The group includes about 10 Orthodox rabbis, with the rest of
its members equally divided between Reform and Conservative
clerics. It is run by a board of six rabbis that includes two
representatives from each of the three movements.
   The unusual cooperation between Orthodox and rival Reform and
Conservative rabbis, as well as the group's lack of political
ideology gives it a moral authority over most of the dozen or so
other Israeli movements considered to be comprised of leftists.
   Western human rights groups, on the other hand, are considered
by many Israelis to be biased in favor of the Palestinians.
   ``We raise our voice, the moral voice of the Jewish spirit,
which holds that every man and woman, without regard for religion
and nationality, is created in the image of God,'' the group's
platform states.
   ``Invested with a religious mandate to speak for the Jewish
people who has suffered so painfully, we must forever remain
sensitive to the suffering of others.''
   Forman criticized Israel's religious leaders on grounds that
they failed to speak out against brutality in the occupied
territories.
   ``We sense a lack of the rabbinic voice and when we do hear it,
it's usually on the farthest right,'' said Forman, 45, a reform
rabbi who immigrated to Israel from Boston in 1972. ``We invite the
chief rabbis to respond to what's happening because it opposes the
spirit of Jewish law and tradition.''
   Chief rabbinate spokesman Eitan Eizman denies the allegations,
saying Israel's Orthodox chief rabbis ``have responded every time
there was an outstanding violation, writing that innocent people
should not be harmed or beaten.''
   Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a settlement leader in Kiryat Arba near
the West Bank town of Hebron, called the rabbis' criticism
misguided.
   ``We have never agreed that these are occupied lands,'' Levinger
said. ``We'll stop the moment the Arabs stop.''
   The rabbis' group is careful not to endorse a political solution
to the 16-month-old conflict, and it denounces Palestinian violence.
   Milgrom, 35, said Judaism ``is often seen as something that
comes to discriminate and persecute the non-Jewish side, and we
oppose that. It does not correctly portray Judaism. ... Man was
created in God's image, every man and not just the Jews.''
   The rabbis said adherence to Jewish religious tradition has also
helped the group in gathering testimony.
   At Batir, for example, Forman and Milgrom used a method
described in Talmudic religious law of comparing testimony from
different witnesses. Forman said that as a result he was convinced
people told the truth, despite an army denial of events described
in the group's report.
   He said the rabbis' group also offers ``rabbinical counselling
for soldiers deeply troubled by the moral and ethical struggle they
confront'' while serving in the occupied territories.
   The group's next project is an investigation of the army policy
of forcing Palestinians to remove barricades built by protesters in
the occupied territories, Forman said.
   ``I don't want to compare us with other countries,'' he said.
``We have to measure our behavior by Jewish standards. If we start
using the lowest common denominator, we cease to be a light unto
the nations.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid the uncertainties of politics and a new
administration, some things were absolutely certain not so long ago.
   There was, for example, no doubt about it: if President Bush was
denied Senate confirmation of John G. Tower to be secretary of
defense, his relations with Congress would never be the same. The
Democratic majorities there would be emboldened to challenge him on
every front. He would retaliate. Any idea of bipartisanship could
be forgotten.
   Tower was rejected. None of the above occurred. The issue
evaporated.
   ``I didn't like what happened,'' Bush said last week. ``So I
would just respectfully disagree with the conclusion that the
United States Senate reached, and I'm going to work with them.
We're going forward now ...''
   So far, this has not been a good year for absolutes that
comprise conventional wisdom about Washington.
   Bush came to office after a campaign that accentuated the
negative and pushed symbols in lieu of issues. Surely the
bitterness wouldn't go away quickly. The Democrats wouldn't let it
happen.
   They did, and not long after the votes were counted. They did
forget quickly about their own nominee. Gov. Michael Dukakis seldom
is mentioned by leaders of the party that ran him for the White
House. When he unexpectedly announced long in advance that he not
seek another term as governor of Massachusetts, the reaction in
Washington was negligible.
   During the campaign, Bush made his ``read my lips'' vow against
new taxes a fixture, part of every speech. Everybody knew the
Democrats were going to make him swallow that line, or at least try.
   Forget that, too, at least for now.
   The president and leaders of the Democratic Congress reached
compromise terms on a federal budget last week. Bush said they had
produced ``the first such agreement reached ahead of schedule and
not framed in the context of a crisis.'' While it leaves the
toughest budget questions to be confronted next year, it preserves
at least until then the president's pledge against new taxes.
   That issue will be back; congressional Democrats said they will
have to look for additional revenues for the next federal budget.
   Nevertheless, it puts another crack in conventional wisdom.
   ``I think if you had asked ... what the chances would have been
that we would be here in agreement on a budget resolution before
April 15th in the first year of the Bush presidency, the answers
would have been slim and none,'' said Richard Darman, the budget
director.
   Okay, but it was a safe bet that President Bush would be living
for a long time in the shadow of Ronald Reagan. After all, he ran
largely on the Reagan record and on his own piece of it as vice
president. He said his election mandate was to continue and to
build upon the Reagan legacy. He promised new faces, but five of
his Cabinet appointees came from the Reagan Cabinet.
   Bush said that within six months or so, the imprint on the
presidency would be his, not Reagan's.
   It didn't take nearly that long. Reagan seldom is mentioned
these days, and that's been the case for weeks.
   Reagan's name did come up at the White House the other day
because of a flap over a column reporting that some Bush aides had
been making snide comments about his work habits. As a result,
Chief of Staff John Sununu was said to have told Bush aides ``don't
get caught, you know, making jokes or being lighthearted or
anything about the past.''
   Scratch one more certainty.
   But don't forget that there was no question Bush would have
serious problems dealing with the White House press. He avoided
press conferences during his fall campaign, and his relations with
reporters sometimes were testy. It pointed to tense times with the
White House press.
   Forget that one, too. So far, Bush has proven the most
accessible of presidents. He doesn't always answer the questions,
but he takes them, and frequently. Bush describes his press policy
this way:
   ``Availability, don't get mad when they ask stuff you don't
like, and treat people as you would whatever walk of life, or
whatever occupation they come from.''
   While all of that raises some doubt about sure bets, one thing
is for certain.
   It can't last.

<HEAD>Everywhere You Look, an MBA</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They may be satirized in cartoons and criticized
by their peers, but MBAs _ men and women holding the master of
business administration degree _ are pervading the big business
scene.
   While most of them still can be found at the division manager
level, more and more are making it all the way to the presidency or
chairmanship.
   Their influence is spreading laterally, too. Once found in
finance jobs, they now serve in every functional area, including
manfacturing, sales and marketing. They are displacing psychology
majors in personnel departments. And they have made deep inroads
into the steel, automotive and chemical industries, which in the
past weren't known as especially promising areas for MBAs.
   They are now a critical mass, exerting power and influence
throughout corporate life and tending to hire even more MBAs.
Noting the need and the interest, the nation's universities are
doing their best to maintain a supply.
   ``No degree program in the past two decades has grown faster
than the MBA,'' says Eugene Jennings, professor of business
management at Michigan State University, who has studied routes to
corporate success for four decades.
   Research by Jennings, who pioneered studies of corporate
mobility patterns in the late 1940s and wrote ``The Mobile
Manager,'' suggests a large industrial company is three times more
likely to be headed by an MBA than was so a decade ago.
   MBAs, he contends, have the drive and commitment to persist
along the long route to the higher echelons of management while
others drop by the wayside.
   Between 1981 and 1986, he found, MBAs made up 9 percent of new
employees with college degrees. At the supervisory level their
representation was double that. And at the even higher division
level it was triple.
   Part of the numerical strength is based on the fact that
corporations are more likely than ever to seek a college degree for
a salaried position. In a sense, he says, an undergraduate degree
has become a union card.
   As a result, those seeking to excel go after graduate degrees,
and the most mobile of all double degrees over the past 20 years,
says Jennings, is the Bachelor of Engineering combined with a
Master of Business Administration.
   Further entrenching the MBAs is the willingness of large
corporations to subsidize graduate education. He estimates that
about one-third of those with MBA degrees earned them while in the
employ of their companies.
   ``Nothing gives a mobile manager more leverage than obtaining an
MBA five to eight years into his or her career,'' says the
professor, among whose many volumes is ``Routes to the Executive
Suite,'' which traces success patterns.
   Among other things, he explains, it removes the educational
anonymity that sometimes surrounds an employee. It demonstrates
that here is an individual who takes business seriously and is
willing to make a long-term commitment.
   No other career group, says Jennings, zeroes in so intensely on
big business. It is the group's primary goal. While big business
might need MBAs, he says, MBAs need big business, and so, ``like a
barnacle, they stick to it.''
   The strong, successful and apparently enduring relationship _
and the pervasiveness of MBAs in various positions throughout the
corporation _ has all but destroyed the stereotype of MBAs as
overly analytical and limited.
   Data from 1981 through 1986 indicate strongly, says Jennings,
that there is a much higher probability than ever before that the
chief executive officer has an MBA in his or her resume.

<HEAD>Marathon Version of Ibsen's `Peer Gynt' at Hartford Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the Hartford Stage Company, director
Mark Lamos has recreated the magical, mystical world of ``Peer
Gynt'' in a dazzling two-part, five-hour production of Ibsen's
rarely performed masterpiece.
   The play, on view through May 20, is a glorious theatrical
adventure, a journey that Lamos manages to make both epic and
intimate.
   Using 26 actors in more than 70 roles, the director and scenic
design wizard John Conklin transport theatergoers around the globe
_ from rustic Norway to a bizarre troll underworld to the sands of
North Africa to a Cairo madhouse to a ship wrecked in a raging sea
and then back again to Norway.
   But Lamos doesn't forget this tale is one man's story of
self-discovery, from brash, self-centered, carefree and charming
youth to cynical, even despairing, old man who finally finds
redemption through the love of a forgiving woman.
   Negotiating the sweep and intimacy of Lamos' production is actor
Richard Thomas. He plays Peer with a fierce determination. Thomas,
who was a robust, non-melancholy Dane in Hartford's ``Hamlet'' last
year, is one of those fearless, energetic actors, willing to take a
chance. Despite his eagerness, he doesn't rush through Ibsen's
difficult poetry, done here in a new, very modern translation by
Gerry Bamman and Irene B. Berman. They follow the playwright's
original rhyme schemes.
   Bamman played the older Peer in Livui Ciulei's production of the
play in 1983 at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. Lamos saw that
revival and thought about doing it at Hartford.
   ``The play has always been sitting there in my mind, waiting, I
guess,'' Lamos says. ``Every year it would come up, and we've talk
about it. But after Richard played `Hamlet' here, we decided to do
it.''
   In fact, Lamos said if it weren't for Thomas, he wouldn't have
attempted the mammoth revival. The actor, according to Lamos,
exuded ``a willingness to take a journey with `Peer Gynt' that
really didn't always seem as if it had a purpose or a goal to it.
That was really the best part of the rehearsal process. We just
kept looking at each other and saying, `Well, let's just keep
traveling. We aren't going to get all the answers right away.'''
   Lamos felt he would get to know the play better if he could
collaborate with Bamman and Berman as they worked on the
translation, which was commissoned by Hartford Stage.
   ``It was a wonderful way of learning `Peer Gynt' from the inside
out and without preconceptions and not taking anything for
granted,'' Lamos says. ``Literally, each moment in the play had to
be dealt with very, very carefully and specifically.
   ``The big surprise was that we found out that a lot of the
existing translations were glossing over more of the crudities
Ibsen was after and more of the slang that he definitely put into
the play. At first, things that we were criticizing in the early
drafts we discovered were, in fact, Ibsen's intentions.
   ``And that made a huge difference in the whole approach to the
play. It was one of the reasons the production became more
childlike and naive and began to have more of a folk quality than I
originally thought it would have.''
   Conklin's settings re-enforce that theme, beginning with the
opening moments of the play. The stage is decorated like a
surrealistic nursery in which Peer lounges in a cradle or commands
a rocking horse as if it were a galloping steed.
   The director and designer have created several memorable images,
the most poignant being the death scene of Peer's mother at the end
of ``Into the Mountains,'' which is Part 1 of the play. The mother,
beautifully played as a loving scold by Patricia Conolly, is
transported to her grave in Peer's cradle now turned into a sleigh
and driven by her son.
   In Part 2, ``The Voyage,'' Conklin fills the stage with
billowing black plastic which becomes the violent sea that finally
washes Peer back home.
   The designer uses yards of fabric to cover the theater floor,
creating snowy mountains, yellow deserts and green forests. More
cloth hangs like a curtain over the theater's back wall, allowing
lighting designer Pat Collins to conjure up mountains as well as
spectral images. Conklin's original designs were more complicated,
Lamos says.
   ``At first, John created a set model which was filled with large
and colorful scenery,'' he said. ``We slowly took pieces out of it
until we came to something much simpler and realized we wanted
something that had more fluidity. That's when we arrived at the
idea of these thousands of yards of flowing China silk and the
shadows that they made behind them.''
   The large cast matches Thomas' enthusiasm, particularly Stephen
Rowe as the vulgar, hedonistic troll king who urges Peer to ``be
yourself and nothing else,'' a motto that still has a large
following today.
   For Lamos, the most challenging aspect of the production was
``to stay open and not try to contain the play with a metaphor of
some kind. I just let it be what it turned out to be, and then it
began to unify itself in a funny way.''
   What can Lamos and Hartford Stage do for an encore?
   The director is not thinking about that just yet.
   ``I don't even want to browse through my drama book shelf at
home,'' Lamos sighs. ``I just want to go look at the ocean for a
while.''

   They were cousins who grew up together in a
Mississippi River town in Louisiana: Jerry Lee Lewis, Mickey Gilley
and Jimmy Swaggart. And if you want the lowdown on them, drop by
Glen McGlothin's barbershop. He not only picks up the latest gossip
while cutting hair, he's also the mayor and the lead singer in a
rock 'n' roll band.

   Mayor Glen McGlothin, who sings with a rock
'n' roll band when he's not barbering or mayoring, dances around
the chair as he clips a patron's hair and talks about Ferriday's
famous four.
   A sign on the edge of town reminds you that Ferriday is ``Home
of Jerry Lee Lewis, Mickey Gilley, Jimmy Swaggart and Howard K.
Smith.''
   The latter, of course, is the network TV anchorman. But the
barbershop gossip this day is mostly about the others, the three
cousins who left this Mississippi River town of 4,000 folks and
took separate routes to make their mark in rock 'n' roll, country
music and TV evangelism.
   ``There's a lot of disappointment in this town,'' says
McGlothin, referring to the furor surrounding Swaggart who was
defrocked by the Assemblies of God Church in 1988 after a New
Orleans prostitute said the evangelist had paid her to pose nude
for him. Swaggart refused a denominational order to stay out of the
pulpit for a year. In January a New Orleans stripper, Mary
Catherine Kampen, made similar allegations against Swaggart in
Penthouse magazine.
   ``You may not agree with him on his thinking,'' says McGlothin,
a member of a clan that grew up with the three famous cousins. ``He
got pretty bad down on the Catholics for a while, and the Baptists.
But a lot of people thought he was a good Christian man. And I'm
not going to say he ain't.
   ``I'm not in the judging business. God does a pretty good job of
judging. The Bible says he who is without sin can cast the first
stone. Well, I couldn't throw a pebble.''
   The woman who made the accusations in Penthouse, he says, ``is
at least pretty. That other girl, though, she was ugly. Just pure
ugly.''
   The mayor-barber perks up when asked about Jerry Lee Lewis, the
rock 'n' roll legend whose life story is depicted in a new movie
titled ``Great Balls of Fire'' due for release in late June.
   ``I was just a tad when Jerry Lee lived in town,'' says the
42-year-old McGlothin. ``He was cocky but he said he would make it
big one day. I'd listen to him rattle that piano and say to myself
that I would, too.''
   When McGlothin was about 21 and ready to try the big time, the
Army grabbed him.
   ``It was Christmas Eve 1967 when I got drafted,'' he says.
``Boy, was I mad. Two LSU football players and I were getting the
physical. I'm telling you, these boys were big. They could knock
walls down and eat nails. They flunked the physical. Me, I was
dried up, 140 pounds, and passed.
   ``The next thing I knew, I was in the 1st Cavalry in Vietnam and
they made me point man on patrol. I still don't know who disliked
me so much.''
   Doing a jitterbug step around his barber chair, McGlothin sighs
and concedes that even if the Army hadn't intervened, he still
wouldn't have made it as lead singer in a big-time band.
   ``I had the stardust like a lot of kids around here who were
poor and saw how Jerry Lee and Mickey made it,'' he says. ``But I
never had what it takes to make it big. Jerry Lee had that thing.
He could make you jump out of a seat and dance. That's the thing
that sells records.''
   Gilley, well-known in country music circles, became nationally
known when the movie ``Urban Cowboy'' featured the nightclub
``Gilley's'' in Pasadena, Texas, outside Houston. Gilley was
part-owner of the club, which is now closed.
   The mayor's band, Fast Eddie and the Partyrockers, does all
right around Ferriday and Natchez, across the river in Mississippi.

   In a case that has shaken this town noted for
its thundering waterfalls, a high school student is going on trial
for clubbing his mother to death with a baseball bat in an argument
over his romance with a 15-year-old girl. The relationship between
Billy Shrubsall and his domineering mother is at the heart of the
case, and lawyers for both sides concede the issues are not
clear-cut.

<TEXT>
   At the close of his valedictory
address to the LaSalle High School's Class of 1988, Billy Shrubsall
penned a tribute to his mother, Marianne ``Marge'' Shrubsall.
   ``On a personal note, I would like to thank my mother, who
taught me my reach should exceed my grasp,'' he wrote. ``Thank you,
Mom.''
   The words of gratitude for a parent who pushed a son toward
academic excellence went unspoken, however. Twelve hours before he
was to give the speech, police say, Shrubsall bludgeoned his mother
to death with a baseball bat.
   Instead of crowning an accomplished high school career that
brought him to the top of his 250-member class, Shrubsall found
himself in jail, charged with second-degree murder, and this city
known for its awesome waterfalls found itself trying to understand
what had happened.
   ``When I heard, the first thing I said was, `No way; it wasn't
Bill,''' says Billy Hartman, a classmate who knew Shrubsall for six
years. ``It still doesn't seem true to me now.''
   Adds another friend, Terry Adamec: ``He had everything going for
him. A class valedictorian wouldn't do something like that. He was
the smartest guy in the whole school.''
   When the case comes to trial, probably this spring or early
summer, defense attorney Paul G. Cleary won't dispute that
Shrubsall clubbed his mother several times with a baseball bat in
the early morning hours of June 25, 1988.
   While an automatic plea of innocent was entered in the case,
Cleary will likely reprise a defense he used successfully in a
highly publicized case in nearby Allegany County several years ago.
   In that case, Leslie Emick was convicted of second-degree
manslaughter in the shooting death of her common-law husband while
he slept in the family motor home.
   Cleary's legal approach: Emick was the victim of a ``battered
wife'' syndrome and finally snapped after years of brutal sexual
torture at the hands of her boyfriend.
   ``The `battered woman' syndrome applies also to other types of
violence or abuse within a household,'' Cleary says. The thread, he
says, is physical and-or mental domination ``in which the abusee
develops almost a total dependance on the abusor.''
   The Shrubsall case has elements of both physical and mental
domination, Cleary says. Although Shrubsall is a sturdy 6-footer,
his mother outweighed him by more than 100 pounds.
   The evidence of mental domination is clearer. Marge Shrubsall
was always a strict authority figure in the home, according to
friends, and she had become even more so after the death of her
husband, William, three years earlier.
   Her goal for her son was academic excellence.
   ``We all knew how the mother pushed him,'' says a neighbor, Tony
Kobler. ``She expected him to be a whiz-bang.''
   Cleary would not permit an interview with Shrubsall. But in a
statement he gave police following the killing, Shrubsall said he
began to rebel against his mother's strict house rules and she
responded with violence.
   ``The more you so-call brow-beat her, the more you argue your
point, the worse she gets until she gets to the point where she
starts to hit me, and I mean I have been hit several times,'' he
told police. ``Her hits ranged from slaps to backhands.''
   David Zacher, a friend of Shrubsall's since junior high school,
says, ``He had bruises on his arms and I never really thought about
it much.''
   The situation grew more tense when Shrubsall entered his first
serious romantic relationship, with 15-year-old Gretchen Rowe. Mrs.
Shrubsall was not happy about the romance, according to a statement
Miss Rowe gave police.
   ``She has also accused him of loving me more than her, but
that's wrong because he did love his mother very much,'' she said.
   The night before his graduation, Shrubsall was at Miss Rowe's
house. Told to be home by midnight, he was late after going back to
retrieve some things he'd left at the girl's house.
   Mrs. Shrubsall was in her car in the driveway ready to drive to
the Rowe house to get her son when he arrived, according to the
police statement.
   A heated argument ensued inside the house, with Mrs. Shrubsall
calling Miss Rowe ``a slut'' and him ``slime,'' according to
Shrubsall. She started to call Miss Rowe to demand that the two end
their relationship. When Shrubsall tried to stop her, she elbowed
him and he pushed back.
   Shrubsall told police his mother then threatened to kill him and
backed him down a hallway.
   Feeling she was going to strangle him, Shrubsall said he
``turned around and picked up the first thing and I hit her a lot
of times. So many times out of fear, and then, after that, I don't
know. I was genuinely scared and I was protecting myself.''
   Cleary said that while some may have fled the situation, state
law ``does not impose upon a person the duty to retreat when
confronted with a threatening situation in his or her own home.''
   Niagara County District Attorney Peter Broderick, whose office
will prosecute the case, doesn't think that a defense patterned
after the Emick case will work.
   ``I would think that's an awfully tough defense to establish,
even in a spousal situation, never mind a mother and son,'' he says.
   Broderick called Shrubsall's statement to police ``loaded with
self-serving declarations.'' While he said he could ``see a lot of
background circumstances which probably dictated his conduct,''
they are not enough ``to justify his actions.''
   While both sides say there has been no attempt at
plea-bargaining, second-degree manslaughter charges were added in a
second grand jury indictment, possibly setting up a situation where
Shrubsall might plead guilty to lesser charges.
   Broderick says plea-bargaining is discussed in almost every case
but, ``Frankly, I have a lot of difficulty with that at this
point.'' That's because a manslaughter plea would make Shrubsall
eligible for youthful offender status, he says, ``and that
minimizes the penalties significantly. The maximum then becomes
nine years as opposed to 25.''
   But Broderick also realizes the problems of trying a defendant
who even the police have called an all-American type with no
previous record.
   ``Sometimes it's easy, it's clear-cut,'' said Broderick. ``A lot
of times it's not very easy, and in this case, it's difficult.''

   It's called the Snow Train or the Moose Meat
Special, depending on the time of year and the interests of its
passengers, and for tourists it's a way to pierce the wilds of
Canada without severe damage to the household budget. First built
to haul iron ore and timber out of the hinterland north of Sault
Ste. Marie, the Algoma Central Railway was later discovered by
hunters, artists and sightseers.

<TEXT>
   The train is highballing
through an awesome crack in the Earth's surface, on a scenic
journey to nowhere and back.
   Inside the no-frills passenger cars, steam heat and the morning
sun fog the wide windows.
   A bored kid punches his sister in the arm. She wails.
   Their grandmother is preoccupied with the vista outside the
window, pristine soft snow and black rock, snow so deep it reaches
the roofs of fishing cabins.
   In the dining car, a young couple from Detroit asks if they can
get American bacon instead of Canadian bacon with their eggs. Three
happy-go-lucky guys lurch down the aisle without spilling a drop
from their open cans of beer.
   All had crossed the U.S. border at Sault Ste. Marie and bought a
$35 ticket for an eight-hour, round-trip train ride through the
Canadian wilderness to Eaton 120 miles to the north.
   Ninety years ago, the Algoma Central Railway first pierced the
Canadian hinterland. It was built to bring iron ore out of Wawa and
timber out of Hearst. Then it was discovered by artists, sportsmen
and tourists, who know it by such names as the Snow Train or the
Moose Meat Special, depending on the time of year. Business is
brisk in the snowbound winter, gets even better during the spring
and summer.
   Today, Lucy Dassance was riding the rail with her daughter's
family, the seven of them among the hundreds of Americans who take
Algoma Central's weekend tour each year.
   A local makes regular stops along the way during the week, but
on the weekend sightseeing run there are no stops. No depots. Just
ride to the end of the line, get up, turn your seats around and
ride back.
   ``My husband didn't come,'' Mrs. Dassance says. ``He said he had
enough snow back in Michigan.''
   Outside, a cold wind rips through Agawa Canyon, tearing at the
rock walls with ice crystals, further eroding this wild, open cut
in the Earth's skin.
   The Agawa Canyon has been molded by erosion and sculpted by
glacier. Up close, it is a narrow cleft in the dark, gray rock
through which a river tumbles and the railroad runs. Giant
pressures thrust up granite mountains so long ago the range has
eroded to its jutting, broken spine. Volcanic fissures shot up
veins rich with minerals: gold, iron, phosphate, silica sand.
   It takes a satellite to show the gorge's true nature _ a 90-mile
north-south crack in the planet, says Ed Frey, a staff geologist
for Ontario's Ministry of Northern Development and Mines. ``The
rail line follows a natural weakness in the Earth's crust. It's a
major fault.''
   Agawa means ``sheltered place'' to Don Stone's people, the
Ojibwa. From Michipicoten Harbour, near the rail's midpoint, Stone
guides American hunters and tells black bear legends handed down
from his father and grandfather.
   Stone's stories also include a topical account of the 1850
treaty his people signed with the Crown, giving away land that 30
years later was granted to the railroads to open up Ontario.
   The mining and timbering produced small towns along the track _
Hawk Junction, Batchawana, Searchmont _ but so much of the
territory remains a wilderness that game hunters ride in by rail,
shoot their quarry and then flag down the train for the ride back.
   In October, moose season, the Algoma Central Railway adds cars
to carry the quarry. They call it the Moose Meat Special, but moose
isn't the only meat on board.
   ``I've seen bear ride the train, too,'' Stone says.
   You could get there by road, in many places, but that loses the
romanticism, he says.
   There was no road beyond Batchawana when the Algoma line
attracted its first train tourists _ a band of rebel Canadian
artists called the Group of Seven.
   In 1918, some of these radical artists hopped a caboose in Sault
Ste. Marie to ride into the wild Algoma. They shunted from siding
to siding, sketching the strong land with wild Picasso skies on the
inside covers of their cigar-box palettes.
   The art world laughed but the Seven prevailed. They would become
some of Canada's most famous artists.
   Dan Murray understands what drew the Seven. At 66 and retired
from Algoma Steel, Murray is starting a career in art, following
the path laid by the Seven and mapped personally for him.
   ``I have been in the area,'' he says. ``I have stood in the spot
where J.E.H. MacDonald did `The Solemn Land.' You can feel it.''
   Decades after the train trips, Murray's sister-in-law rented a
summer cottage to a returning member of the Seven, A.Y. Jackson.
   Murray was born to the land but he never saw it as ``the rich,
strong North'' until Jackson showed him how.
   ``He opened my eyes,'' Murray says.
   To Stan Black, the Algoma Central Railway is more than art and
recreation. It is commerce. Black, a vice president of the company,
says the railroad last year moved 1.4 million tons of iron ore,
limestone and coke.
   The railroad carried an additional 1 million tons of
manufactured products such as steel and almost half as much timber
and wood pulp, he says.
   But there is a shadow across Black's figures. Eighty percent of
the railroad's life comes from freight traffic. The biggest hunk _
as much as 57 percent _ is jeopardized by Algoma Steel's talks of
closing the George W. MacLeod iron ore mine in Wawa.
   It not only is the only producing iron ore mine on the line, but
it is also the very mine the Algoma railroad was built to serve in
1899.
   At Eton, 120 miles from Sault Ste. Marie (the Soo), the tourist
train stops. The seats are reversed and the tour starts back.
Passengers fell asleep in the warm sun of late afternoon, rocked by
the sway of the train.
   Margo Downing grabs some peace in a cup of coffee and a
cigarette and vows she is going to quit her job as train tour guide.
   ``I used to enjoy this,'' she says. ``But there are some days
when nobody's happy.''
   She looked out the window at the spectacular view, the frozen
waterfalls, the jagged cliffs. ``I know I'll miss this,'' she says.
``It's the one thing I'll really miss.''

   He's a physician by profession and when he
started writing novels about a sleuthing antique dealer he took a
pen name that means worthless in the slang of antique dealers. John
Grant, the doctor, sometimes feels guilty about the time he spends
away from his medical work as Jonathan Gash, the writer, but for
him it sure beats golf.

<TEXT>
   Lovejoy, you see, is this sometimes shady
antique dealer who is always broke, a know-it-all sleuth with an
eye for women who almost always have an eye for him. He's also a
knight errant in setting right challenges that range from murder to
the plight of a stutterer.
   Needless to say, he is always in trouble, which is the trademark
given him by his creator, the ebullient English author, Jonathan
Gash.
   Gash acknowledges that his dozen books that feature Lovejoy
abound in plots and subplots that defy the most analytic reader.
   ``The Swedes, who measure such things, say there are an average
of 4{ major plots and 13 minor plots per book,'' he says. ``They
say the usual is two major plots and three subplots.''
   Gash doesn't plan his stories that wses, on the faculty of the Institute
of Tropical
Medicine at the University of London and a visiting professor at
half a dozen Middle Eastern universities.
   When he was in medical school and needing money, he recalls, ``I
got a job in Petticoat Lane. ... It was an antiques market in those
days.
   ``The Cockney antique dealers were angels. I feel like sending
them my M.D. sometimes. They kept me alive. They paid me for the
work I did and never saw me go hungry. As soon as they knew I was a
medical student they couldn't do enough. With that and a couple of
night jobs, I made my way through college.''
   It was in Petticoat Lane that the doctor-in-training got his pen
name, Gash.
   ``If you go among street markets in London, it's one of the
commonest words you'll hear,'' he says. ``It means good for
nothing. It has a bit of a joke in it. I couldn't find another
author whose name was Gash. It's the same initial as my name. And
it's one I could remember.''
   He married Pam, a nurse, when he was 21. ``Pam was affluent,''
Gash says. ``She had 7 pounds in the bank. I'd never seen so much
money in my life. We lived in a garret, really. It didn't seem
especially brave.''
   Gash reports gleefully that two of their three daughters are
married to actors named Richard and the other says with her luck
she'll marry Richard III. The Gashes have two grandchildren. A
third is expected on July 4.
   Since writing ``The Judas Pair'' in 1977, Gash works without an
outline and sometimes has more than one book under way at once.
   ``I don't know how to write a book,'' he says. ``I write
everything longhand, very small lines very close, on sheets of
paper.
   ``It's like a jigsaw. I may write chapter 19 first. I don't know
how to plan a novel or how to bring in a new character unless it
just comes. I never know what is going to be in my mind.
   ``When I've done it all, I rewrite it over the original in a
different color ink _ red. Then blue and green, until finally it
looks like a map of the underground. Then I send it off to the
typist. Then I do the same thing again to the typescript _ black,
red, blue, green. It's indecipherable. `Gold by Gemini' took 13
rewrites. The fewest rewrites was `The Vatican Rip,' which took
seven.''
   Gash's latest book ``Jade Woman,'' published by St. Martin's
Press, is set in Hong Kong where Gash and his family lived in the
1960s and where he was director of clinical pathology at Queen Mary
Hospital and working in infectious diseases at Hey Ling Chau leper
colony.
   ``Jade Woman'' may be the book that makes him a household-name
like fellow Brits P.D. James and Dick Francis, although he finds
fame embarrassing.
   ``I suppose it is the guilt of laying aside your medical work
for a while, even if it's an hour a day,'' he says. ``I find that
very painful. You go to a clinic, see several patients dying. By
way of light relief, you write something. There is deep within you
the feeling, `Look here, you've stopped working. Instead you're
scribbling inanities about some shoddy antique dealer.' ``I know
it's a human being's way of pacing himself. An executive who makes
major decisions goes out and plays golf. This is my game.
   ``I feel like an intruder into the whole literary scene. If I
had the time I would go to Cambridge and do a degree in English
lit. Think how marvelous that must be. We go to medical school. Six
years later we emerge, blinking at the light, never having seen
anybody but doctors and patients. We're highly trained. We're not
educated. There's something a wee bit wrong about that.''

   Unlike many actors who are eager to leave old
series characters behind, Peter Falk readily admits he is happy to
be back playing ``Columbo.''
   Falk feels comfortable as the rumpled, ruminating detective he
created in the original series that ran on NBC from 1971 to 1977.
He won three Emmy awards as best actor for the role.
   ``Columbo'' is now a part of the ``ABC Mystery Movie'' lineup.
   ``I was sorry it went off the air the last time,'' says Falk,
sitting on a stool by an easel in the art studio behind his Beverly
Hills home. ``I think there's still a lot of life left in that
character. I think it'll be a terrific character to see grow old.
It'll be fun to see him creaking around.
   ``I don't think his emotional appeal has anything to do with
age. I think he'll be even funnier as he grows old. `I don't feel
well, sir. Sorry, forgive me, it takes me a while to get up these
steps.'''
   As he talks, Falk squirms on the stool. He screws up his face.
His brows knit. He suddenly smiles. He throws back an arm to
scratch his head. His shirt rises up to reveal his bare belly.
   It's like watching Columbo go through his routine. Here, it's
merely fun to watch Falk. On the screen, Columbo's mannerisms are
calculated to make the suspect underestimate him. He may put the
suspect off guard or make him so exasperated he makes a mistake.
   The art studio is devoted to Falk's work as a charcoal artist.
He also works in pencil and in black and sepia crayons in a
turn-of-the-century French style. On the easel and around the
studio are examples of his drawings of the female figure. They are
reminiscent of Edgar Degas' ``ballet girl'' sketches.
   ``I've been drawing about 13 years,'' Falk says. ``But it's not
how long you've been doing it, but how often. I'd rather do nothing
but draw for two years straight than dabble for 13 years.''
   Elaine May, his sometime collaborator on films, told Falk that
she saw Columbo as ``a backward Sherlock Holmes.''
   ``Sherlock Holmes had a long neck,'' he says. ``Columbo has a
short, thick neck. Holmes was an aristocrat. Columbo is from the
streets. Holmes smoked a meerschaum pipe. Columbo smokes 35-cent
Italian cigars. Holmes was an elegant dresser. I can't find the
words to describe Columbo's wardrobe.
   ``What they have in common is an insatiable curiosity, a fierce
logic, flashes of intuition and an innate sense about human
behavior. They are helpless victims of their own obsessions. They
have to find out, they have to know what really happened. They are
both cerebral rather than physical. Columbo can't stand guns or the
sound of gunfire. He doesn't even carry a gun. He's got too many
papers in his pockets.''
   ``Columbo'' was created by two of television's foremost
practitioners of crime, William Link and the late Richard Levinson.
The character made his first appearance on a summer mystery show
with Bert Freed in 1960. Thomas Mitchell was Columbo in a stage
play, ``Prescription: Murder,'' that later became the first Columbo
movie in 1968. Bing Crosby and Lee J. Cobb reportedly turned down
the role before it went to Falk.
   Falk believes Columbo's lack of pretension and his ``comfort in
his own skin'' give him an appeal.
   ``He's a genuinely polite man, not to say he's not canny,'' he
says. ``It's hard for me to know when he actually forgets or when
he's abstracted. He has a kind of misty quality. He's aware of how
to hound somebody and how to get to them. He knows how to play his
hand and hold back his ace.
   ``People enjoy seeing how he's going to catch the suspect. It's
a cat and mouse game. It's that aspect where Columbo and the
villain are both saying that I know you know that you know that I
know.''
   In a recent show Columbo came up against an authority on sex
played by Lindsay Crouse. She was a writer and host of a radio show
with an open and approving attitude toward contemporary sexual
standards. Columbo possesses old-fashioned romantic ideas about
sex. It made for a tantalizing match.
   In 1979, NBC attempted to capitalize on ``Columbo'' by doing a
spinoff starring his wife. Columbo frequently referred to his wife,
but she was never seen. Falk's idea of Mrs. Columbo was that she
was a homebody surrounded by children.
   But ``Kate Loves a Mystery'' introduced a young, beautiful and
stylish Mrs. Columbo played by Kate Mulgrew. The show was a dud,
and NBC quickly changed her name to Kate Callahan to erase any
reference to Lt. Columbo. The show was still a disaster and was
gone by the end of the year.
   ``I never approved of showing her,'' Falk says. ``That way
everyone could have his own idea of what she was like. Columbo's a
storyteller. He makes frequent references to children and nephews.
When he doesn't want to reveal where he learned a piece of
information he'll say someone in his family told him.''

   Little things bring home the reality of starring
in a big Broadway play.
   People on the bus who ask, ``Did I go to high school with you?''
or ``Did you live in my mother's apartment building?''
   Or the persistent gaze of strangers who give you the kind of
stares that mean they either want to steal your purse or
congratulate you on your performance.
   Such are the problems facing actress Joan Allen, who now has her
name above the title in Wendy Wasserstein's hit comedy, ``The Heidi
Chronicles.''
   ``I try to be nice to people, but it makes me embarrassed,''
says the quiet, almost shy Allen, relaxing in her tiny dressing
room backstage at the Plymouth Theater. ``Especially when they say
`Where do I know you from?' And then you have to stand there and
say `I did this and I did that' and listen to them say, `No, No.
No.' And finally, `Oh, that's it!''
   For Allen, the Plymouth Theater has become something of a
permanent home.
   She was there last season in Lanford Wilson's ``Burn This.'' She
won a Tony Award as best actress for her portrayal of a grieving
dancer mourning the death of her roommate.
   Now she is back with ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' which won the
1989 Pulitzer Prize for drama. In it, she plays art historian Heidi
Holland, a witness to 20 years of changing attitudes toward women
in modern America.
   ``Heidi is a very complicated character,'' Allen says. ``The
more I've done the play, the more I've learned about her.''
   And she has had time to get acquainted with Heidi. The play
began last December at off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons, a small
but important New York company where such works as ``Sunday in the
Park with George'' and ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' two other recent
Pulitzer Prize winners, got their start.
   ``Heidi may not get involved, but she takes everything very
personally,'' Allen says. ``She feels things deeply and sticks to
her own path. Because she doesn't rail at the winds, people find
her to be some sort of a pushover. I don't find her to be that
passive.''
   The play follows Heidi from the late '60s and the era of Vietnam
War protests to the late '80s when the Reagan era has come and gone
and the dreams of the baby boomers have begun to burst.
   The 32-year-old Allen came of age some seven or eight years
later than the character she plays on stage. And with less
turbulence. The actress is from Rochelle, Ill., some 80 miles west
of Chicago. Her father, now retired, ran a gas station.
   ``It's farm country _ corn fields and soybeans,'' she says. ``It
was very quiet and a great way to grow up. I was allowed to be a
kid forever.''
   Allen first went to Eastern Illinois University where as a
freshman she studied drama and met John Malkovich, a junior. The
following year Malkovich transferred to Illinois State University
and linked up with people like Gary Sinise, Terry Kinney and Laurie
Metcalfe. Out of this group of young drama students came the
Steppenwolf Theater Company.
   After college, Allen joined the fledgling company which had
found a home in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park. To earn money,
she kept a full-time job as a secretary for an educational film
company.
   ``My experiences aren't like those of a lot of other
actresses,'' she says of her early days. ``With Steppenwolf, I had
a ready-made family. I would know what show I was doing, and I
almost never auditioned during the entire seven years I lived in
Chicago. We read for parts among ourselves. It created a lot of
security. We didn't have to keep proving ourselves.''
   Allen kept her job as a secretary even when she was doing eight
shows a week at Steppenwolf. Only when she came to New York in 1983
with a Steppenwolf production of ``And a Nightingale Sang'' did she
quit outside work.
   The success the previous year of Sam Shepard's ``True West,''
starring Malkovich and Sinise, made the move to New York easier for
other Steppenwolf members.
   ``Until then, I had never been to New York _ not even to
visit,'' Allen says. ``It was the right time in my life. I was in
my late 20s, and it was a good role for me. Again I came with a
Steppenwolf show, so there was a sort of built-in security.''
   In ``Nightingale,'' Allen played a shy, crippled English
spinster. From the show, Allen got an agent, rave reviews and a
six-month run. She decided to stay in New York and won a part in
Christopher Durang's comedy ``The Marriage of Bette and Boo,'' as
well as movie roles in such films as ``Peggy Sue Got Married,''
``Manhunter'' and ``Tucker.''
   Allen teamed up with Malkovich for a year-long run in ``Burn
This,'' which first played Los Angeles, then Steppenwolf's theater
in Chicago and finally New York.
   The month that ``Burn This'' opened on Broadway in 1987, Allen
did a reading for ``The Heidi Chronicles.'' It was an early draft
of the play, but Allen immediately knew she wanted to play Heidi
when the comedy was done on stage.
   She got her wish. For the next six months or so at the Plymouth,
Allen will concentrate on Heidi, refining the character.
   ``When we started rehearsals, Wendy would drop telling comments
about the kind of woman Heidi was and then I would use my
imagination,'' Allen says. ``We also sat in on some art history
lectures and talked to different art historians.''
   The actress also met with well-known feminist art historian
Linda Nochlin who teaches at the City University of New York. She
attended Nochlin's graduate class and read her essay, ``Why are
there no famous women painters?''.
   Still, the actress doesn't know if her portrait of Heidi Holland
will ever be complete.
   ``That's what is so good about the theater,'' she says. ``It's
an alive art form. You keep working on something and hopefully, the
more you do it, the better you get at it.''

   For the first time in nearly 20 years, Chileans
will elect a president this year to replace an iron-fisted military
leader. But it could be too early for rejoicing. This is another in
a series of periodic reports by The Associated Press on the
economic, social and political turbulence that has turned South
America into a continent in crisis.

   Lame ducks though they may be, Chile's
military leaders already are casting an ominous shadow over the
civilian government that will take office next year.
   They have made it unabashedly clear that while they will step
aside they won't step out and will seize power again if they think
it is necessary.
   And therein lies a major difficulty for the civilian who wins
the presidential election Dec. 14 and takes over March 11 from Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, the iron-fisted president since 1973.
   The military government will bequeath a growing and stable
economy to the civilians, but they also will leave deep and
potentially explosive social imbalances.
   Millions of Chileans are still poor _ as they were when Pinochet
led the military into the civilian disarray of September 1973 and
overthrew President Salvador Allende, the Marxist who professed to
want to help the poor.
   Recent opinion polls indicate that while Chileans have a
relatively robust economy, low salaries and unemployment are high
on their list of priorities for the civilian government.
   As politicians prepare for the election, Pinochet and other
military leaders make it clear they do not plan a complete retreat
from the political scene.
   Pinochet recently said military leaders have the obligation to
ensure that the future civilian president is ``an authentic
democratic man.''
   And the military is on record that it won't hesitate to
intervene again.
   ``If the institutional order is broken, the armed forces have
the duty to restore it, using compulsion and all the necessary
means,'' Gen. Alejandro Medina, head of a center of strategic
studies, said in a recent lecture to non-commissioned officers.
   Civilian politicians complain that will place the armed forces
in the role of ``armed guardians'' of the civilian government.
   A constitution drawn up by the military government in 1980 gives
the armed forces the means for such a role. It allows Pinochet, who
still commands the army, and the commanders of the navy, air force
and national police to keep their posts until 1998.
   Pinochet, who is constitutionally prohibited from seeking
re-election in December, has already said he will remain as army
commander after the election.
   That is tantamount to ``creating an armed state within an
unarmed democratic state,'' said Genero Arriagada, vice president
of the centrist Christian Democratic Party, the largest in the
opposition.
   The constitution also established a military-dominated National
Council, which may ``represent'' its views to the civilian
government on key matters.
   More complicated for the future leaders may be the problem of
human rights violations during 16 years of military rule.
   Opposition leaders say that should they win the election, they
will investigate the abuses and try those found responsible.
   The military leaders have made it clear, however, they it will
not permit reprisals for what they see as actions that were part of
a war.
   In the military years, thousands of leftists were arrested, many
were sent into exile and hundreds were killed. Local and foreign
human rights groups have documented more than 700 cases of
dissidents who disappeared after being arrested by security forces.
   A recent opinion poll taken by the Center for Public Studies, an
independent research institute, however, indicates that Chileans
are more interested in their personal economic situations than in
the political complexities of the process to restore civilian rule
or in the military threats to take power again.
   In a nationwide poll taken by the center in March and April, 46
percent of the respondents mentioned low salaries and inefficient
public health services as the two top items on a civilian
government's agenda.

<TEXT>
   Turkish yuppies in bluejeans and
miniskirts sip coffee at a fashionable waterside cafe on the
Bosporous, seemingly oblivious of the Moslem faithful bent in
sabbath prayers in a mosque just a few feet away.
   Turkey is a country of such contrasts.
   Istanbul and Ankara, the centers of commercial, intellectual and
parliamentary life, feature glittering Hiltons, shopping centers
and traffic-clogged streets, while an hour's flight away are the
horse-drawn carts and souks of Diyarbakir in the far east where
politics are often inflamed by blood feuds.
   With one foot in Europe and the other in Asia, Turkey yearns to
be a part of the West but also feels the pull _ and bears the
vestiges _ of the East.
   Its armies reached the gates of Vienna three centuries ago but
were beaten back in what was the start of the decline of the
Ottoman Empire.
   Today Turkey seeks to enter Europe peacefully, bidding for
membership in the European Economic Community (EEC), the symbol of
West European democracies' economic and political clout.
   It would fulfill the dream of Kemal Ataturk, the revered father
of modern Turkey, who put the overwhelmingly Moslem country on a
Westward bent by turning away from Islamic law to build a republic
based on separation of church and state in 1923.
   Turkish officials believe they have already paid their dues for
admission to the West by fighting alongside U.S. troops in Korea
and by membership in North Atlantic Treaty Organization, protecting
a land border with the Soviet Union. But the EEC bid is seen as the
acid test.
   ``It's one of the few subjects in which there's more or less a
consensus in Turkey,'' said Inal Batu, the Foreign Ministry
spokesman.
   He acknowledged, stressing Turkey's dilemma, that some Europeans
think the EEC ``is a club for Christians.''
   Says Stephen J. Karper, general manager of Citibank in Istanbul
and an American: ``Europeans have to become familar with Turkey.''
   But Turks, too, have become increasingly wary of signs of a rise
of Islamic fundamentalism, which has seen women marching in the
streets covered head to toe and strained Turkey's relations with
neighboring Iran.
   That, coupled with a history of military interventions to topple
democratic governments and charges that torture in prisons
persists, raises questions about how solid Western foundations are.
   On the other hand, since the military returned to the barracks
in 1983, Premier Turgut Ozal has taken giant steps in shaping a
Turkey of the late 20th century.
   New airports, highways and power grids have gone up around the
country, bringing electricity and direct-dial telephone service to
remote mountain villages in the east. Vast housing projects are
being built, replacing the ``gecekondu'' (meaning ``built
overnight''), the shantytowns that gave Ankara and other cities a
Third World look.
   Bankers are high on Turkey as a safe place for foreign
investment and cite its large domestic market and food resources.
   ``When you can feed people, they have more patience,'' said
Citibank's Karper.
   On the drawing board is a vast project to irrigate the barren
southeast Anatolian plain, near Turkey's borders with Syria and
Iraq, to further exploit Turkey's rich agricultural potential and
stem the flow of peasants to the cities in search of work.
   In other words, development in a rush not only to get Turkey on
the European track but also to provide for a fast-growing
population now at 55 million.
   But Turks, and now Ozal himself, have paid a price for this.
Ozal's liberal economic policies aimed at forcing Turkish
industries to compete on European terms and heavy public spending
have spurred economic growth but also triggered inflation running
as high as 75 percent that has impoverished many Turks.
   This in a country where school teachers and other civil servants
earn as little as $100 a month without wage indexing to protect
against inflation so dear to Western Europe's Socialist economies.
   Voters punished Ozal in nationwide local elections in March,
sending his governing Motherland Party to a humiliating third place
in the polls.
   But others factors were also blamed and tell much about Turkey
today.
   Ozal's expressed sympathy for Moslem fundamentalist women,
barred by the Constitutional Court from wearing Islamic headscarves
on university campuses, apparently cost him the votes of millions
of ``secular'' Turks. The fundamentalist vote, about 10 percent of
the electorate, went to a religious party.

<HEAD>AIDS Reduces The Ranks Of Residents At NYC Hospitals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kings County Hospital is the Parris Island of
American medicine, a sometimes hellish boot camp that tuns out
seasoned professionals.
   It has 140 internists in training, more than any other U.S.
institution, and some of the city's poorest and sickest people.
Recruiting a few good men and women, however, has been getting
harder and harder.
   Five years ago, 90 percent of the hospital's medicine residents
_ staff doctors in training _ were graduates of American medical
schools; today, less than half are. Even in the worst years, Kings
County could count on getting 20 to 25 graduates of the medical
school of the State University of New York, with which it is
affiliated; last year not a single SUNY graduate applied, and only
three of 60 first-year residents are from American schools.
   There are a many reasons why young doctors might shun a hospital
like Kings County, but here's the most obvious: Half the patients
in the internal medicine service have AIDS. ``That may have been
the straw that broke the camel's back,'' says Dr. Richard Schwartz,
the medical school's provost.
   With more than 8,800 residents, New York City hospitals train
almost 10 percent of the nation's physicians _ three times more
than any other city. But at a time when the hospitals need more
residents than ever, the quality and quantity of applicants is
declining. Leading teaching hospitals can't attract their top
recruits, and others have scrambled to fill their residency slots
with graduates of foreign medical schools.
   In recent years fewer U.S. medical students have gone into less
lucrative ``primary care'' specialities like internal medicine and
pediatrics. New York seems to be having more trouble attracting
such residents than other cities and one thing that sets it apart
from them is AIDS. It has a fourth of the nation's cases, and in
two years as many as 10,000 of its 25,000 general hospital beds
could be filled by AIDS patients.
   Although the chances of doctors catching acquired immune
deficiency syndrome from their patients are low, a survey at New
York and San Francisco hospitals found that fear of AIDS
preoccupied doctors and gave them nightmares.
   Medical students ``can be so overwhelmed with AIDS patients you
don't get the broad experience a resident wants,'' says Caroline
Reich of Emory University, chairman-elect of student
representatives to the American Association of Medical Colleges.
   A residency is supposed to expose young physicians to a wide
variety of illnesses and patients; doctors worry that if too many
of their patients have AIDS, their exposure becomes too narrow and
their diagnostic skills atrophy. A residency is also supposed to be
educational but AIDS patients are so sick that their care leaves
little time for study or consultation with senior doctors.
   Donald Wilson is chief of medicine at Kings County Hospital.
When he was making his hospital rounds as a resident 25 years ago,
he usually had to spend only five to 10 minutes with each patient.
``A good proportion of them weren't particularly sick,'' he says.
   Now, though, ``one AIDS patient might require as much time and
attention as six of the people I used to see,'' Wilson says. ``It
takes an enormous toll, physicially and emotionally, on our staff.''
   AIDS is the health care crisis of the decade, but in much of the
nation it remains an exotic curiosity. ``Most people who are
looking to go into private practice don't think they'll be seeing
many AIDS patients and don't feel they need an intensive exposure
to AIDS during their residency,'' says Cindy Osman of Brown
University, president of the American Medical Student Association.
   Some doctors and students argue that caring for AIDS patients is
good training. ``It doesn't sound nice to say it, but AIDS patients
have lots of medical problems, and the sickest patients are often
the ones you learn the most from,'' says Ron Samuels of Syracuse
University Medical School, who plans to do his pediatric residency
a New York City hospital.
   The real problem may not be AIDS per se but the type of AIDS
patients increasingly entering New York hospitals: intravenous drug
abusers. Nationally, AIDS is spreading fastest among drug users,
their sex partners and children, and New York City has about a
third of all such cases. Drug abusers have surpassed gay men in
newly reported cases in the city.
   The average drug-addicted AIDS patient is a physician's
nightmare: he requires vast amounts of care, although very little
can be done to help him. He frequently fails to follow medical
instructions, and often resents the doctor's inability to halt his
decline.
   ``An important part of medicine is identifying with the patient,
knowing how to talk to them,'' says Michael Caldwell, a student at
Mount Sinai Medical School. ``But that's so lacking with a lot of
these AIDS patients.
   ``I have nothing in common with a male prostitute drug addict. I
have sympathy for him, but I can't empathize.''
   Homosexual men, on the other hand, are generally regarded as
good patients. They tend to have supportive relatives and friends
and a respect for medical authority. At San Francisco General
Hospital, which has relatively few drug addicts, applications for
internal medicine residencies has increased.
   The burden of caring for AIDS patients is accentuated by a
shortage of nurses and support staff. That translates into the bane
of every resident _ scut, hospital slang for necessary but
non-medical tasks that can be performed by non-physicians, such as
taking blood or delivering medical records.
   If students think New York is short of people to help with scut,
they'll give its hospitals a wide berth, said Clay Balentine,
chairman of student representatives to the American Association of
Medical Colleges. ``The time you spend pushing a wheel chair is
time you can't spend reading.''
   At elite institutions like Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and
New York University-Bellevue Hospital, AIDS and its related
problems have merely made residency programs less selective. At
others, it has meant an increase in the number of foreign medical
school graduates hired as residents.
   Although everyone pays lip service to the notion that foreign
medical school grads _ FMGs, as they're called _ aren't necessarily
inferior to AMGs, the best teaching hospitals take virtually
nothing but AMGs because they are a known commodity. This attitude,
passed to students, guarantees segregation.
   ``If a program has a high percentage of foreign school grads,
that program is that much less attractive to American school
students,'' says Beth Aklo, a fourth-year medical student at the
University of Connecticut and a student representative to the
medical colleges association.
   ``While most of us feel that the good students at foreign
medical schools are as as good as U.S. grads, the bad are really
bad. They couldn't get out of American schools. Doctors don't want
to work with other doctors who are weak.''

<HEAD>Spread Of Fire Ants Not Likely To Be Checked, Researcher Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Farmers and homeowners should probably just
learn to live with fire ants, says a researcher who has been
unsuccessful at stopping the imported pests whose sting sends
21,000 Americans a year to doctors.
   ``With today's technology, there's nothing out there that'll
eradicate them,'' said Stan Diffie, a researcher at the University
of Georgia's Coastal Plain Experiment Station. ``We can control
them, but we can't eradicate them.''
   Diffie and entomologist Craig Sheppard are evaluating chemical
and biological controls for the South American insect believed to
have entered the United States in Mobile, Ala., about 60 years ago.
Since then, fire ants have spread to 270 million acres in the
Carolinas, Puerto Rico, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgia, Alabama,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Arkansas.
   Fire ants reproduce quickly and spread rapidly. In south
Georgia, it's not uncommon to find 40 mounds per acre, which isn't
a problem in pastures, but in fields where machinery is used ``you
would have a problem,'' Diffie said.
   ``They're a nuisance _ a people pest, whether it's unsightliness
in your yards or stinging your kids,'' said Diffie. The ants'
painful stings force at least 21,000 people to seek medical
treatment each year, according to a survey of physicians in 13
states for the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology.
   Nearly 40 percent of those treated were in Texas, according to
the survey, and 20 percent were in Florida. Thirty-two people died
from stings last year, mostly people especially sensitive to the
toxin and bitten more than once.
   ``People and physicians should take these stings seriously,''
said Dr. Robert Rhoades, a pediatrician at the Medical College of
Georgia who monitors medical problems caused by fire ants. People
allergic to other kinds of insect stings should be especially
cautious. The stings cause a burning sensation, usually followed by
formation of pus around the site within 24 hours.
   But fire ants also help farmers by attacking pests such as
ticks, worms and other insects that damage sugar cane, cotton and
pecans. Up to 250,000 ants can live in each mound, which can extend
up to six feet in the soil.
   ``They'll eat anything that's dead. You have to have something
out there to clean up the carcasses,'' Diffie said.
   In the search for effective controls, Diffie has studied baits,
pesticides and natural enemies such as nematodes and mites. He
makes bait from corn grits soaked with soybean oil and poison. The
bait, scattered on pastures and fields, is carried into fire ant
mounds and kills ants that consume the mixture.
   Only a few ants in each colony are capable of reproduction.
Fertile males and females have wings and mate in flight. Then the
males die and the females establish new colonies. ``You have got to
kill the queen,'' Diffie said. ``If you don't, she'll just keep
laying eggs.''
   Common pesticides can kill fire ants, but don't remain active
long enough in the soil to be a long-term solution, he said. ``It
would be nice if we could put them where we want them _ get them
out of the yard and put them in the pecan orchards and sugar cane
fields. But I'd rather see them gone altogether. If we didn't have
them, we'd find ways to control the other pests.''
   Concern about the environmental hazards has led researchers to
look for biological controls, including microscopic worms known as
nematodes, and straw-itch mites, which are a natural enemy of fire
ants.
   ``Nematodes were mixed in water and poured over a fire ant
mound. About 2 million nematodes could be mixed in two gallons of
water,'' Diffie said. Those tests weren't considered very
successful because only about 37 percent of the colonies treated
with nematodes were destroyed.
   Mites were ``fairly successful,'' he said, ``But the cost is
prohibitive as treatments are $5 per mound and two treatments are
necessary.''

   Tom was a successful businessman who
sought treatment for what his wife viewed as a gambling problem. He
seemed bored until another patient told of the thrill of chasing
women.
   Tom, 35, sat forward, listened attentively, then astounded
members of the therapy group with his own tales of womanizing.
   Twelve percent to 14 percent of patients who admit themselves
for alcohol, drug and gambling addiction treatment also show
patterns of sexual addiction, say Bonnie J. Adkins and Julian I.
Taber of the Veterans Administration.
   Multiple addictions are frequently found among patients being
treated for one addiction, such as alcohol, drugs, gambling or
kleptomania, agreed Stephen B. Levine, a psychiatrist at University
Hospitals of Cleveland.
   Two decades of bringing sex out of the closet have increased the
number of patients who enter sex clinics, said Levine. ``We saw
five or six patients in 1980, 20 in 1981, 125 in 1983. Every year
the number goes up and up.''
   Treatment includes group therapy, in which addicts hear others'
rationalizations and ``see how they are kidding themselves, make
them face what they are doing and understand the impact on the
individual,'' he said. That is followed by individual therapy, and
if patients are married their wives get counseling. ``Then we bring
the couples together and eventually we hope to start treating
children, but not yet.''
   Ninety percent of Levine's patients are men. ``It may be that
males have more of a tendency to act while women keep such problems
private and quiet and it usually doesn't lead to violence for
them,'' he said.
   At the VA hospital in this Cleveland suburb, everyone seeking
treatment for compulsive behavior must write and read their life
story in the first two weeks of the four-week program, making them
face their problems, Mrs. Adkins said.
   Addiction has several possible causes, including such external
influences as alcohol, or changes in body chemistry, or there may
be a genetic link because many addicts have addicted parents or
grandparents, she said.
   ``There also is research on whether they become addicted to
their own endorphins. When a risk taker begins (taking risks) his
body shoots endorphins into his system. It's a type of morphine, it
makes them feel good.
   ``They like the feeling so they continue the behavior to get the
feeling.''
   A number of self-help sex therapy groups have started nationwide
in the past decade, operating much like Alcoholics Anonymous, she
said. Sex Addicts Annonymous, started in Minneapoils in 1978, has
35 chapters in that area. Sex, Love Addicts Anonymous, a California
group, has about 400 chapters nationwide.
   Sexual compulsiveness covers a wide range of behavior, including
perversion, obscene phone calls, exhibitionism, voyuerism,
pedophilia, sadism, cruelty, rape and masochism, Levine said.
   He credits use in recent years of a progesterone known as
Depo-Provera with helping many men regain control of their lives.
But he also noted it produces such side effects as weight gain,
high blood pressure, and hair loss.
   ``But for some, that's not as bad as the illness,'' he said.
``Perverse sexual behavior is a substitute for remembering trauma
as children. They behave instead of feeling and remembering. We
call it acting out.
   ``We try to help them remember and help them to feel.''
   Levine said a typical sexual addict is a man who feels socially
deficient, views himself as a loner who feels he was socially
isolated as a child and teen and who has a history of being abused
psychologically, physically and sexually.
   Mrs. Adkins said she found no typical profile. ``It cuts across
so many personalities. It's an illness.''

<HEAD>AIDS Reduces The Ranks Of Residents At NYC Hospitals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kings County Hospital is the Parris Island of
American medicine, a sometimes hellish boot camp that tuns out
seasoned professionals.
   It has 140 internists in training, more than any other U.S.
institution, and some of the city's poorest and sickest people.
Recruiting a few good men and women, however, has been getting
harder and harder.
   Five years ago, 90 percent of the hospital's medicine residents
_ staff doctors in training _ were graduates of American medical
schools; today, less than half are. Even in the worst years, Kings
County could count on getting 20 to 25 graduates of the medical
school of the State University of New York, with which it is
affiliated; last year not a single SUNY graduate applied, and only
three of 60 first-year residents are from American schools.
   The most obvious reason why young doctors might shun a hospital
like Kings County is that half the patients in the internal
medicine service have AIDS.
   With more than 8,800 residents, New York hospitals train 10
percent of U.S. physicians _ three times more than any other city.
At a time when hospitals need more residents, the quality and
quantity of applicants is declining.
   Students ``can be so overwhelmed with AIDS patients you don't
get the broad experience a resident wants,'' says Caroline Reich,
chairman-elect of student representatives to the American
Association of Medical Colleges.
   In addition, ``most people who are looking to go into private
practice don't think they'll be seeing many AIDS patients and don't
feel they need an intensive exposure to AIDS during their
residency,'' says Cindy Osman, president of the American Medical
Student Association.
   The real problem may not be AIDS per se but the type of AIDS
patients: intravenous drug abusers. AIDS is spreading fastest among
drug users, their sex partners and children, and New York City has
about a third of all such cases. At San Francisco General Hospital,
which has relatively few addicts, applications for internal
medicine residencies has increased.

<HEAD>Spread Of Fire Ants Not Likely To Be Checked, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TIFTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers and homeowners should probably just
learn to live with fire ants, says a researcher who has been
unsuccessful at stopping the imported pests whose sting sends
21,000 Americans a year to doctors.
   ``With today's technology, there's nothing out there that'll
eradicate them,'' said Stan Diffie, a researcher at the University
of Georgia's Coastal Plain Experiment Station. ``We can control
them, but we can't eradicate them.''
   Diffie and entomologist Craig Sheppard are evaluating chemical
and biological controls for the South American insect believed to
have entered the United States in Mobile, Ala., about 60 years ago.
Since then, fire ants have spread to 270 million acres in the
Carolinas, Puerto Rico, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgia, Alabama,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Arkansas.
   Their painful stings force at least 21,000 people to seek
medical treatment a year, according to a survey of doctors in 13
states for the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology. Nearly
40 percent of those treated were in Texas; 20 percent were in
Florida. Thirty-two people died from stings last year, mostly
people especially sensitive to the toxin and bitten more than once.
   ``People and physicians should take these stings seriously,''
said Dr. Robert Rhoades of the Medical College of Georgia, who
monitors medical problems caused by fire ants. People allergic to
other insect stings should be cautious.
   Fire ants also help farmers by attacking pests such as ticks,
worms and other insects that damage sugar cane, cotton and pecans.
Up to 250,000 ants can live in each mound, which can extend up to
six feet in the soil.

<HEAD>Used in 4,000 B.C., Fig Chemical May Help Fight Viruses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chemical ancient Babylonians extracted
from figs to treat skin ailments is being used to develop animal
vaccines and may prove to be important in detecting and fighting
human viruses, a researcher says.
   The value of the chemicals, called psoralens, for virus
detection and vaccine development lies in their ability to bind the
twined double strands of the DNA molecule, said John E. Hearst, a
University of California, Berkeley, chemistry professor who
reported his work to the American Chemical Society.
   Because psoralen molecules are flat, they can slip between the
two strands of DNA without affecting the DNA itself. When psoralens
are struck by light, they bind with the DNA, locking the two
strands of the structure together.
   Vaccines are generally prepared by first killing a virus with
formaldehyde and then placing the dead viral material into the body
so the immune system can recognize proteins on the virus' outer
coat and develop defenses. Formaldehye reacts with some viral
proteins, so this is not always successful. By locking viral
genetic material, psoralens rob a virus of its ability to replicate.
   Psoralens, used in Babylon as far back as 4,000 B.C. to treat
skin pigmentation diseases, occur naturally in figs, some other
plants and in some microorganisms. They sensitize the skin,
promoting rapid tanning, and were used in tanning lotions until the
Food and Drug Administration labeled them as possible cancer
causers a few years ago.
   Hearst said psoralens also can be used in DNA probes, segments
of a DNA strand for a particular virus that is placed in a blood
sample to bind to the particular virus or bacteria. By counting the
free-floating DNA probes after the test, scientists can determine
whether a particular virus is present.
   Because DNA probe bindings are generally weak, many are not
maintained during the counting, he said, adding that if psoralens
are attached to the DNA probes, the binding is much stronger.

<HEAD>Researchers Studying Question Of Growing Food In Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the tough questions arising out
of years-long space missions or life in a space station are what to
do about sunlight, soil and gravity. Not for the astronauts _ for
their food.
   ``On short missions it's a lot easier to resupply space stations
with TV dinners than to have astronauts grow their own food. If
you're going to Mars or beyond, it would become cheaper to grow
it,'' said Gale Nevill, a University of Florida aerospace engineer
working on space-based ways to grow crops.
   Plants can recycle nutrients and other valuable elements that
otherwise would be discarded. Without recycling, astronauts would
have to replace carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and others elements with
costly, regular shipments from Earth.
   But growing wheat, rice, soybeans and other crops can be tricky.
   ``Right now, there are more problems than solutions,'' said Bill
Knott, chief scientist for NASA's Controlled Ecological Life
Support System project. ``There are some engineering problems in
growing plants in microgravity. You can't go pouring water on a
plant because it floats all over the place.''
   Although models will be tested on Earth in five to 10 years, it
could be 20 to 50 years before automated planting and harvesting
technology reaches space.
   Scientists are patterning the system after Earth: Plants take
nutrition from manure and other waste products and produce food.
Humans inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide; plants use the
carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.
   One problem associated with the lack of gravity is that
nutrient-laden water tends to rise through roots and stems so fast
that the plant doesn't have time to extract nutrients. Researchers
have designed a tiny collar to stop this flow, but the problem has
yet to be solved completely, Nevill said.
   Scientists hope to reduce the time between harvests by about
one-third, Knott said. Because of the limited area available for
crops in a space station, the systems must yield three to 20 times
more than an Earth farmer could grow.

<HEAD>Scientist Report Signs Of Acid-Snow Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of fragile mountain lakes in the West
could be endangered from acid snow, which already is causing
environmental damage, says a researcher who has spent eight years
studying the problem in Colorado.
   One possible sign of the effects of acid precipitation is a drop
in the number of neotene tiger salamanders in Mexican Cut, near
Crested Butte, as acid levels rose, said John Harte, a University
of California professor.
   ``The decline of this salamander population may be the first
indication of biological damage from acid precipitation in the
western United States,'' Harte said. He said he traced the acid
pollution to coal-burning power plants, metal smelters and car
emissions hundreds of miles away.
   He cautioned that his study, to be published in June, did not
prove acid snow to be the undisputed cause, because the salamanders
sometimes are subject to natural population fluctuations, and Larry
Svoboda, of the Environmental Protection Agency, said eight years
of study may not be enough.
   The research is significant because EPA has found that 6,500
high-elevation ponds and lakes in the West are highly vulnerable to
acid precipitation. Such damage has been documented for years in
the Northeast, but not in the West.
   At issue is a symptom known as acid pulse, which happens each
spring when the snow melts. The pollutants contained in the snow
surge downstream into a string of 15 ponds in Mexican Cut, at
11,000 feet up in the Rockies.
   Harte found that without acid pulse, 80 percent of salamander
eggs hatched, but with it, only about one third hatched. He said
the salamander population dropped from 500 to 200 during the study.

<HEAD>Monitor Also Lets Doctors Treat Cardiac Care Patients By Phone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A briefcase-sized monitor that plugs into
a telephone outlet will let doctors for the first time not only
monitor but also treat heart patients even before an ambulance can
arrive.
   The first ``MDphone,'' developed by MEDphone Inc. of Paramus,
N.J., was installed recently in the home of a 72-year-old patient
who had bypass surgery, said Dr. Edwin Rogers, director of cardiac
care at Sacred Heart Hospital here.
   Rogers said his patient will have the MDphone for 90 days.
   ``This is the kind of thing you hope would not be used on the
patient,'' he said. ``The first three months of a heart attack are
critical because this is when a patient is at highest risk of
having another cardiac episode.''
   The MDphone is plugged into a wall jack. If a problem arises,
the patient or family member just opens the case and attaches
electrode pads. The machine automatically dials the hospital
emergency room, setting off alarms. The base unit in the hospital
retrieves the patient's records and displays them on one computer
screen while another shows the electrocardiogram.
   If the patient develops a dangerously erratic heartbeat, known
as cardiac arrhythmia, a doctor at Sacred Heart could immediately
defibrillate the patient by signalling the device to deliver an
electric shock.
   Telemetry systems that give data on patients at remote locations
have been around for years, but the MDphone is the first that
allows treatment in this way, said MEDphone President S. Eric
Wachtel.
   Sacred Heart and two other hospitals, the Wilmington-Christiana
Medical Center of Delaware and Jewish Hospital in St. Louis,
cooperated in development of the MDphone, Wachtel said. The first
installation in St. Louis is expected in about two weeks. Each home
unit costs $7,500 and base units installed in hospital emergency
rooms are $30,000 each.

   Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent
in March, the government said in a report that buoyed spirits on
Wall Street, where fears of spiraling inflation had risen in tandem
with earlier steep price increases.
   Analysts said that while last month's restrained gain in the
Producer Price Index for finished goods should allay fears that
inflation will skyrocket, it does indicate that price rises persist.
   March's 0.4 percent gain, combined with steep gains of 1.0
percent in January and February, works out to a compound annual
inflation rate of 10.2 percent for the first quarter of 1989.

<HEAD>Detroit-Based Brewer Cracks Open A New Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five years after what company officials admit was
a false start in trying to break out of the Midwest, Stroh's beer
is taking a new look and message nationwide.
   Stroh Brewery Co. has sunk $50 million into the marketing
campaign for its flagship brand that begins this week. Experts will
be watching closely to see whether the effort founders amid flat
beer sales in recent years and a market increasingly dominated by
industry-leaders Anheuser-Busch and Miller.
   ``Once you get beyond the No. 1 and No. 2 brewers, Nos. 3, 4 and
5 all face problems,'' said Jerry Steinman, editor of Beer
Marketers Insights, an industry journal. ``They have to look to
take sales from the big guys, but that's like taking it from
gorillas.''
   Stroh, privately held and based in Detroit, is the nation's
third-largest brewer. But its entire lineup holds just an 11
percent share of the U.S. beer market, compared with 41.9 percent
for Anheuser-Busch and 21.6 percent for Miller, according to
Beverage Industry Magazine.
   Company sources told The Detroit News that Stroh annual revenues
have stagnated at $1.5 billion annually since 1985. And the Stroh's
brand itself holds only 2 percent of the national market, Beverage
Industry said.
   The new campaign includes revamped advertising, redesigned
containers and even new posters and mirrors to be distributed to
bars and party stores.
   ``We consider this a continuation of our (national) introduction
of the brand,'' said William L. Henry, Stroh vice president of
marketing.
   ``Our opportunity with Stroh's is to appeal to a lot of people
in America who have never even had a Stroh's,'' said Hal Riney, a
San Francisco advertising executive who created the new campaign.
``And there are millions of those.''
   Stroh will spend $20 million on Riney's new ads, which will
stress both the new packaging and the company's 200-year heritage
as a family enterprise. Anheuser-Busch, by comparison, spent an
estimated $130 million in 1988 just to advertise Budweiser.
   Another industry expert questioned whether Stroh could overcome
the growing piles of money that Anheuser-Busch and Miller are
throwing into a market diluted in recent years by beverages other
than beer.
   ``I know of no brewers in the history of the brewing industry
who have ever turned around a brand after a serious slide,'' said
Robert Weinberg, head of R.S. Weinberg &amp; Associates. ``It's a very
unforgiving industry.''
   Stroh still has other brands on which to fall back, including
Old Milwaukee, Schlitz and Schaefer, all of which it acquired
earlier this decade. But officials are hopeful of reviving the
company's namesake brand.
   ``In my 11 years here, this is the most striking set of changes
I've seen,'' Stroh president Roger Fridholm said. ``I think we have
a chance of getting some very positive consumer reaction.''

<HEAD>Perpich Holds Secret Meeting With Davis In San Francisco</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines suitor Marvin Davis is
determined to continue with his bid to buy the airline, Gov. Rudy
Perpich said today after meeting secretly in San Francisco with the
billionaire oilman.
   ``He's serious,'' Perpich said early today in a telephone
interview from his hotel room in Atlanta. ``He said he's going to
the mat, and I believe him.''
   Davis' $2.62 billion offer for NWA Inc., Northwest's parent, has
been rejected by the company's board, but Perpich said Davis still
plans to outline today how he would pay for the buyout of the
nation's fourth-largest carrier.
   Neither Davis nor a spokesman could be reached immediately for
comment.
   Perpich, who has led efforts to stop Davis' attempted takeover,
met Sunday morning with Davis, who flew into San Francisco
International Airport on his private jet. Perpich was in California
on other state business.
   KSTP-TV taped the two shaking hands on the tarmac before the
90-minute meeting.
   Perpich said he had heard talk that Davis has been unable to put
together financing to buy Northwest, and ``I was hoping to hear
that (Davis was) going to back off.''
   But the governor said he found a determined Davis.
   ``He knows what he wants,'' Perpich said. ``This (Northwest) is
what he wants. He's not going away. I think it's (the takeover
battle) going to be a long one.''
   Perpich said he left the meeting with a favorable impression of
Davis, but he added that he will continue his effort to stop the
takeover.
   ``Some people were saying he's in it just to make a quick
buck,'' the governor said. ``That's not his intent. He's put a lot
of money into this effort.''
   Davis told Perpich he also considered making offers for Eastern
Airlines and Trans World Airlines.
   ``He's interested in Northwest because it goes to the Far East,
and that's the future,'' the governor said. ``I think this is going
to be the Super Bowl of takeovers.''
   Perpich said the meeting gave him a chance to tell Davis the
importance of keeping intact the airline, which employees more than
15,000 people in Minnesota.
   Perpich said Davis assured him that jobs and the airline hub
would stay in Minnesota, and that Davis planned further expansion
in the state.

   Share prices were moderately firmer in dull
trading early Monday afternoon as traders said the market lacked a
unifying theme to push it in either direction.
   ``There's not a lot of action,'' said one British dealer. ``We
always find Mondays are a bit hesitant and it takes some time for
the market to get rekindled from the weekend.''
   British economic indicators released late in the morning did
little to inspire more activity in the market, dealers said.
   Some market watchers said most eyes were on the futures market,
where stock-index futures traded up to a 60-point premium over the
cash market.
   Others said the onset of a three-week trading account tended to
put off investment decisions until a clear short-term direction for
the market could be discerned.
   At noontime in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was hovering just above 2,058.0, a gain of 4
points, or .19 percent. The market made its way toward the 2,065.3
intraday high in early trading, while its late morning low point
was 2,056.8.
   At 11 a.m. GMT, the narrower Financial Times 30-share index was
off 2.3 points at 1,688.7.
   Turnover amounted to 218.3 million shares by midday.

   The stock market pulled back in early trading
today, retracing some of Friday's sharp gains ahead of the March
consumer price data.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 4.22 points to
2,332.84 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EDT.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the Big Board by about
3 to 2, with 553 issues up, 377 down and 565 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.71 million shares.
   Analysts said some market players decided to take profits and a
brief respite after Friday's big gains.
   ``The market has a tendency to follow a pop like Friday with a
pullback,'' said Larry Wachtel, vice president of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. ``Also, despite the producer price numbers, there
is some concern that consumer prices might not be that good.''
   The government is scheduled to release data on consumer prices
for March on Tuesday.
   The market rallied from a week-long stupor on Friday after the
government released several economic reports which the market
interpreted as indicating inflationary pressures were easing.
Producer prices, which is a gauge of inflation at the wholesale
level, rose 0.4 percent last month, after the index grew by 1
percent in each of the two previous months, the government said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.24 to 168.65.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was off
0.14 to 335.68.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 41.06 points
to 2,337.06, for its best single-day showing since it rose 43.92

   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 on the

   Coastal Corp. extended its $2.6 billion tender
offer today for Texas Eastern Corp.'s outstanding stock despite an
agreement between Texas Eastern and a rival suitor.
   The offer and withdrawal period will now expire at midnight May
5, unless it is further extended, a Coastal statement said. About
43,326 shares have been tendered to date, the statement said.
   The battle for Texas Eastern began Jan. 16 when Houston-based
Coastal announced its surprise takeover bid. But the Texas Eastern
board rejected the bid as too low, signing a merger agreement
instead with Panhandle Eastern Corp. on Feb. 21.
   Panhandle Eastern's $3.2 billion offer includes provisions to
buy up to 80 percent of Texas Eastern's 60.8 million outstanding
shares and a stock exchange at the same $53-a-share value for the
remaining shares.
   The combination of the two Houston-based natural gas companies
would create a 27,000-mile system and result in one of the nation's
largest pipeline companies in terms of miles.

   Stock prices were recovering in early trading
today, after a sluggish start as the market took a breather from
Friday's strong advances.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.03 points to
2,341.09 at 11 a.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator had lost 4.22

   Analysts said that despite today's weak start and a new consumer
price report on Tuesday, stock prices could continue Friday's gains.
   New producer price data, which showed a 0.4 percent increase for
March, triggered a sharp rally on Friday after the market
languished in the week leading up to the report.

market and an indication that inflationary pressures were subsiding
after rises of 1 percent in each of the previous two months. The
Producer Price Index is an important gauge of inflation at the

   Money-losing Control Data Corp. today said it
will eliminate its supercomputer business and make other cuts that
will cost 3,100 jobs.
   The computer maker decided it ``can't afford to continue product
development across such a wide section of products,'' said
spokesman Frank Ryan.
   The move will result in restructuring charges of $490 million,
including $350 million from liquidation of ETA Systems, the
subsidiary started in 1983 to compete with Twin Cities rival Cray
Research Inc. and other supercomputer makers.
   Asked if Control Data attempted to sell ETA Systems, Ryan said,
``We looked at all options. The shutdown was the most practical.''
   ETA has never made money for Control Data. In 1988 it had
operating losses of about $100 million. It has sold 34 machines
ranging in price from $1 million to $20 million.
   ETA will account for 800 of the 3,100 layoffs, with the rest
made in corporate ranks and other sectors, Ryan said.
   Ryan said the company will continue to service its supercomputer
customers. Besides focusing on its Cyber mainframe computers,
Control Data will also build its data storage business and
businesses such as lottery equipment for states.
   Control Data stock dropped 62{ cents to $21.75 in early morning
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Chairman Robert Price said the company, which has had five
consecutive years of financial difficulty, said the restructuring
should result in a profitable second half of 1989 and set the stage
for sustained growth.
   Control Data has had two consecutive quarterly losses, including
a $12.8 million loss in the fourth quarter of 1988. For the year,
the company had a profit of $1.7 million after earning $19.3
million in 1987 and losing a total of $832 million in 1986 and 1985.
   Ryan said most of the restructuring costs will be charged
against the second quarter of this year.

   PPG Industries Inc. said today that higher
sales and operating earnings in its coatings and chemicals
businesses helped produce the company's best first quarter ever,
with a 9 percent profit increase.
   The company said after-tax earnings rose to $129.8 million, or
$1.15 per share, in the first 1989 quarter from $118.6 million, or
$1.07 per share, in 1988's first quarter. Sales increased 6 percent
to $1.459 billion from $1.373 billion.
   Lower sales of flatglass and unfavorable currency transactions
washed out sales gains for original and replacement auto glass, the
Pittsburgh-based company said.
   Sales of glass, PPG's leading product, slid 1.7 percent to $588
million from $598 million. Operating earnings for the unit dropped
18.3 percent to $94 million from $115 million.
   Increased sales of automotive paint and industrial coatings and
progress in controlling costs overcame the less favorable currency
exchange rates in PPG's second-largest line. Unit sales rose 10
percent to $512 million from $465 million, and operating earnings
rose 17.6 percent to $80 million from $68 million.
   Improved prices and sales volume for most basic and specialty
chemicals, including a new chemical plant in Taiwan, helped lift
the unit's revenue 40.7 percent to $315 million from $261 million
and boost operating earnings 20.6 percent to $76 million from $63
million.

   Corn and soybean futures opened strongly this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade amid fears that the Midwest's
unusually dry spring will extend into the growing season.
   Wheat futures were slightly higher in early trading.
   Memories of last summer's drought remain fresh in traders'
minds, and each day without rain in the Corn Belt bolsters the
bullish trend.
   Of special concern is the low level of subsoil moisture in Iowa
and northwestern Illinois, some of the nation's prime corn and
soybean country.
   The Des Moines Register is reporting that an Iowa State
University study has found Iowa's soil moisture to be at about half
the normal level across much of the state.
   The National Weather Service is predicting increased rainfall in
the western Corn Belt late this week and early next week. But many
private forecasters foresee little rain and warmer temperatures.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 2\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.14 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
to 4 cents higher with May at $2.74 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
5} cents higher with May at $1.97{ a bushel; soybeans were 6} cents
to 9\ cents higher with May at $7.40 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were moderately higher while pork futures were
mixed in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .40 cent higher with June at 71.35
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .57 cent higher with
May at 76.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .05

<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. today delivered the last of 50
C-5B jumbo cargo planes to the Air Force, completing a seven-year,
$6.9 billion contract that drew accusations of greed from Congress.
   The final C-5B, the biggest air cargo carrier in the free world,
took off after a ceremony, made a salute lap around Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems Co. headquarters in suburban Marietta and then
headed for the air base at Dover, Del.
   The company has no plans for further production of the C-5B,
said Robert Z. Christopher, director of the C-5 program. Lockheed
Aeronautical is a division of Lockheed Corp., the Calabasas,
Calif.-based aeronautics giant.
   The C-5B is 248 feet long, has a wing span of 223 feet and a
65-foot, T-shaped tail, high as a six-story building.
   The jet, an updated version of the C-5A, can carry almost any
piece of the Army's hardware _ two 50-ton M-1 tanks, for example.
   It has been used recently for such non-military missions as
carrying equipment and supplies to the site of the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Alaska and aid to the victims of the earthquake in the
Soviet republic of Armenia, said Air Force spokesman Capt. Tom
Dolney.
   The huge contract has been a boon to the Atlanta-area, providing
thousands of jobs and pumping millions of subcontracting dollars
into 40 states.
   Today's ceremony marked a happy landing in the flight of the
C-5B project. But it was a bumpy ride.
   Lockheed won the contract in 1982, beating out Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas. The original pact was for $7.8 billion.
   Production of the plane's predecessor, the C-5A, was marred by
revelations that the Air Force had purchased ineffective repair
kits from Lockheed that included $229.94 nickel-sized washers.
   Shortly before the first C-5B was to be delivered in late 1985,
it was discovered that tens of thousands of nuts on the planes had
to be replaced because the ones installed were the wrong kind.
   The Pentagon accused the company of inflating the C-5B contract
by as much as $500 million by withholding details of a proposed
two-tier wage system for its new employees; by 1987 the price tag
had been whittled down to $6.9 billion.
   A review by the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, found that in late 1986 Lockheed proposed to
charge the government $211.13 for an inch-long shim, a metal wedge
that was an excess part from C-5B production and originally valued
at $22.09.
   Last month, the Air Force said it had imposed flight
restrictions on 20 C-5B's because of a problem with the pylon, the
assembly that holds the jet engine to the wing.
   Lockheed has proposed to the Air Force that the plant maintain
its C-5B tooling, company spokesman Doug Oliver said.
   ``Their decision will pretty much tell us what the future of the
C-5B is,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $1 billion sale of the United
Artists movie studio to Australia's Qintex Entertainment Inc. has
been approved by the Quintex board of directors, the company
announced today.
   The deal, in essence, will split the present MGM-UA
Communications Co., and leave majority shareholder Kirk Kerkorian
in control of the MGM portion of the business.
   The renamed United Artists Corp. would be the first big American
motion picture studio to pass into foreign hands.
Australian-turned-U.S. citizen Rupert Murdoch owns 20th Century Fox
Film Corp. through his News Corp.
   Qintex Entertainment is a TV company that financed part of the
CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' and bills itself as Australia's
largest independent TV production and distribution company.
   United Artists, one of the five dominant U.S. movie studios,
holds the rights to 4,000 movies, including the ``The Pink
Panther'' and James Bond series and Rocky films.
   The sale agreement calls for Qintex to pay $20 a share, or about
$1 billion, for MGM-UA.
   Financier Kirkorian, who holds 82 percent of MGM-UA stock, then
will buy back MGM assets for $250 million. Included in the ``new''
MGM will be movie and TV production assets and a library of 34
recent films, including ``Moonstruck'' and ``A Fish Called Wanda.''
   The deal is expected to close in late summer.
   MGM-UA lost $39.5 million in the first quarter of its 1989
fiscal year. The loss was attributed to increased interest expense
and high write-offs on movies in production and already released.

<HEAD>Idaho Wood Products Company Reports Record Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boise Cascade Corp. Monday reported all-time
quarterly records for profits, sales and earnings per share.
   During the first three months of 1989, the Boise-based wood
products company said after-tax income rose to $78.2 million, up 14
percent from $68.5 million in the same quarter a year earlier.
Sales came to $1.1 billion in the latest quarter, up from $1
billion a year before.
   Earnings per share were $1.68 in this year's first quarter
compared to $1.44 in the corresponding 1988 quarter.
   It was the second straight quarter and the sixth in the last
seven in which new highs were posted in net income.
   ``We expect the company to have another excellent year in 1989
if the economy continues to grow at a modest rate,'' Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer John Fery said. ``Relatively strong markets
for most paper grades and for office products should largely offset
a soft market for newsprint.''
   All three of the corporation's major segments _ paper and paper
products, building products and office products _ posted increased
sales and operating income over the first quarter of 1988.
   In the paper segment, which produces over half the company's
sales, price increases for uncoated papers offset softness in the
newsprint sector and continued tight margins in the corrugated
container business as well as disruption of pulp and paper mill
operations due to severe weather in February.
   Office products posted record sales and operating income as
volume increased 17 percent over a year earlier and the corporation
maintained and increased its market share in almost every major
urban area it serves, Fery said.
   The building products segment showed only modest improvement
over a year ago, but the gain came despite the sale of three
wood-products plants that were contributing to the corporate
balance sheet during the first quarter of 1988.
   With prices for western lumber and plywood up from year-earlier
levels, Fery said, ``We expect our building products segment to do
as well as it did last year.''

   The U.S. dollar fell sharply Monday against major
currencies in European trading after signs of a slowdown in the
American economy. Gold prices also dropped.
   Foreign exchange dealers said recent U.S. economic statistics
had confused their market about whether the dollar was headed
higher or lower and the uncertainty caused a drop.
   They said the main factors had been the 20.9 percent swelling in
the U.S. trade deficit to $10.5 billion in February and the slowing
of the growth rate in U.S. producer prices.
   The U.S. consumer price index due on Tuesday could set the
dollar's tone for the rest of the week, dealers said. One dealer
said if the rise in the index is small, the dollar could drop from
1.85 German marks to 1.83.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7095 late Monday, more
expensive for buyers than Friday's $1.7000.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Friday's
late rates: 1.8565 West German marks, down from 1.8725; 1.6385
Swiss francs, down from 1.6510; 6.2825 French francs, down from
6.3350; 2.0953 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1145; 1,364.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,374.25; 1.1855 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1875.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 131.83 Japanese yen, down
from 132.55 at Friday's close. In London late Monday the dollar
traded lower at 131.70 yen.
   Gold bullion traded late in London, the major market, at $385.00
bid a troy ounce, down from $386.50. The late bid price in Zurich
was $384.50, down from $387.00.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $385.65, down from $382.65.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.80 a troy
ounce, down from $5.89.

<HEAD>Insurers, Businesses Fight Over Who Pays For Multibillion-dollar
Cleanups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The start of multibillion-dollar industrial
waste cleanups around the nation has triggered a legal war between
insurance companies and corporate polluters over who should foot
the bill.
   Insurers last week won their second battle in recent months,
when a New Jersey judge ruled that 126 insurers for former Diamond
Shamrock Co. bore no liability for injuries caused by the
production of a toxic byproduct of the defoliant Agent Orange.
   Lawyers said the decision by Superior Court Judge Reginald
Stanton in Morristown will have bearing on more than 50 similar
lawsuits involving billions of dollars around the country.
Potentially, the problem could involve thousands of cleanup sites.
   The Diamond Shamrock case is ``part of a larger struggle that's
going on between the insurance industry and companies'' facing
cleanup costs, said Jacquie Warren, a lawyer with the Natural
Resources Defense Council in New York.
   In December, a jury found Shell Oil Co. liable for cleaning up
the Rocky Mountain Arsenal near Denver, where the company leased
land from the Army from 1952 to 1982 for a pesticide production
plant.
   The jury ruled that Shell could not collect from its more than
250 insurers for cleanup and injury costs at the site estimated by
the federal government in 1983 at $1.8 billion.
   ``I think that the insurance companies are now engaged in a
massive nationwide effort in courts and the media to try to renege
on their obligations to their policy-holder,'' said Eugene
Anderson, a New York lawyer whose firm represents more than 40
policy-holders fighting for insurance coverage.
   Judge Stanton ruled that Diamond Shamrock's insurance policies
do not cover an industrial cleanup of more than $25 million because
the company knowingly bypassed environmental controls, polluting
the Passaic River and land around a Newark plant with dioxin.
   The company, then known as Diamond Alkali, made Agent Orange and
other herbicides at the Newark plant from 1951 to 1969. A byproduct
was dioxin, which has been linked to various cancers, liver
disease, birth defects and a severe skin rash.
   ``Diamond's conduct in operating the Newark plant was
unacceptably wrong and irresponsible,'' Stanton wrote in a 50-page
opinion. ``Diamond always put its narrowly perceived economic
interest first. It deliberately and persistently cheated on the
limited environmental regulations which were in place.''
   But Stanton did order the insurers to pay the company's $23
million share of a $180 million settlement with Vietnam War victims
of Agent Orange, which was used to strip natural cover from
guerillas.
   For Maxus Energy Corp. of Dallas, Diamond Shamrock's parent, the
cleanup cost in Newark will exceed $25 million. Maxus said it
intervened as soon as dioxin was found at the site in 1983 and
cooperated with environmental officials in its removal.
   Diamond Alkali was a predecessor of Diamond Shamrock, which was
sold to Occidental Petroleum Corp. in 1986. Maxus Energy assumed
liability for cleanups of certain sites, including the Newark plant.
   After the 1986 sale, Maxus set aside a $75 million reserve for
cleanup costs, spokeswoman Ginger Shearburn said.
   Maxus called Stanton's ruling on the dioxin ``incorrect'' and is
considering an appeal. Its stock dropped 12{ cents to $7.62{
Wednesday, a day after the decision was released to lawyers, and
was trading in the $7 range Monday.
   Stanton's ruling goes against much of the state's case law on
the subject, which is generally favorable to policy-holders,
lawyers said. More than a dozen such lawsuits have been filed in
New Jersey, the most in the nation.
   Diamond Shamrock sued its insurers over the Newark plant in
1984. Two years later it again sued its insurers, seeking coverage
for about 20 non-dioxin sites nationwide.
   Robert Bates, attorney for American Re-Insurance Co. of
Princeton, a defendant in the Morristown lawsuits, said Stanton's
decision could have a major impact on the second case, in which
cleanup costs were not available.
   Ms. Warren of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental activist group, said insurance policies should be
expensive enough and companies should assume enough risk to
guarantee they handle and dispose of dangerous materials properly.
   But she added that society needs an ``insurance cushion'' to
protect an innocent third party if a company cannot pay for a
cleanup. ``It's a fine line to draw,'' she said.

   Stock prices on the London Stock Exchange closed
mixed Monday in lackluster trading.
   At the close the Financial Times 100-share index was up 1.1
points, or .05 percent, at 2054.7.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was down 4.9 points
at 1686.1, reflecting losses by several major capitalized stocks.
Volume was thin, as 468.1 million shares changed hands, compared
with Friday's 648.1 million shares.
   Shares got off to a buoyant start on the back of continued
enthusiasm following Friday's rally in London and on Wall Street.
But the positive tone wore thin as participants steered clear of
the market and as doubts about the underlying health of the British
economy returned.
   ``There's a general degree of uncertainty'' about the British
economic picture, said one trader.
   A major worry at the moment is whether higher wage settlements
will add to inflationary pressures, he added.
   There was little reaction to news that British retail sales in
March were unchanged in volume terms from the previous month, while
rising 4.7 percent from a year earlier.
   While perhaps signaling a slowing of consumer demand, the
provisional figures could be revised significantly in coming weeks,
dealers said.

   Stock prices were up slightly but activity
slowed in afternoon trading as the market turned its attention to
the coming consumer price report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.57 points to
2,339.63 at 2 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 1.65 points
at noon EDT after a mixed morning session.
   Declining issues narrowly outpaced advancers by about 12 to 7 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 752 issues down, 644 up and 535

   Analysts said trading activity slowed as many players left the
market to await Tuesday's government report on consumer prices. The
market had opened lower, rebounded quickly and then took back some
of its gains.
   On Friday, the producer price report triggered a sharp rally as
the market interpreted the 0.4 percent increase for March as a sign
that inflationary pressures were subsiding. The producer price
index, a measure of inflation at the wholesale level, had risen 1
percent in each of the previous two months.
   Observers said the market is expecting consumer prices to hold
steady at February's 0.4 percent level, or rise only slightly.
   ``If we get that number, I think the market is poised to make a

<HEAD>First-Quarter Income Up Sharply; US Sprint ``Turns Corner''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Telecommunications Inc., saying
its US Sprint unit has ``turned the corner,'' reported Monday that
companywide earnings more than doubled in the first quarter.
   United Telecom said it earned $76.4 million, or 73 cents a
share, during the quarter ended March 31, up from $34.4 million, or
33 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1988.
   The earnings came on an 18 percent increase in consolidated
revenue, to $1.77 billion from $1.5 billion.
   US Sprint Communications Co., the long-distance telephone
operation which lost $124 million in the first quarter of 1988, had
operating income of $27.5 million this time. Its operating revenue
increase 30 percent to $984 million from about $757 million a year
earlier.
   A 9 percent gain in traffic volume offset the effects of a
first-quarter price decrease, producing revenue gains of 6 percent
over the fourth quarter of 1988.
   ``Clearly, US Sprint has turned the corner,'' said United
Telecom President William T. Esrey.
   US Sprint was formed in July 1986 as a joint venture in which
United Telecom and GTE Corp. combined their long-distance and data
communications subsidiaries. United Telecom, which also provides
local phone service in several states, purchased controlling
interest last year.
   Esrey cited significant new revenue growth opportunities in the
international market, the public pay phone market and a contract
with the federal government. He also said the company has
strengthened its capabiliities to penetrate the ``800'' and private
line markets and will benefit from the entry of its Sprint Services
unit into the ``900'' and operator services markets.
   Sprint Services, formed to provide directory assistance, credit
card validation and operator assistance for person-to-person and
collect calls for US Sprint customers, will start service by
mid-year.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Dismiss Lawsuit By Ethanol Producers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has refused to dismiss a
$2.1 billion antitrust lawsuit filed by fuel alcohol producers
against four major oil companies.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Baker on Friday rejected the
oil companies' argument that the ethanol producers were not in
competition with them and therefore had no financial interest that
would lead them to sue.
   Seven ethanol producers allege that the oil companies _ Marathon
Petroleum Co., Shell Oil Co., AMOCO Oil Co., and Chevron U.S.A. _
conspired to ruin the market for gasohol, a blend of 90 percent
gasoline and 10 percent ethanol.
   Attorney Bob Wright of Lafayette, La., representing the
plaintiffs, has argued that the oil companies tried to ``retard''
the growth of the ethanol industry.
   The judge ruled the oil companies and the ethanol producers were
in competition for the non-diesel automobile fuel market.
   The ethanol makers contend the oil companies used signs on their
gasoline pumps saying such things as ``our gasoline contains no
alcohol or ethanol'' to discourage motorists from using gasohol.
   Ethanol, which can be made from corn, increases the octane of
gasoline and reduces pollution in automobile emissions, according
to the National Corn Growers Association.
   The plaintiffs are Greater Rockford Energy and Technology Corp.,
of Rockford; Shepherd Oil Inc., of Jennings, La.; Vidalia Ethanol
Ltd., of Vidalia, La.; Lakefield Ethanol Inc., of Lakefield, Minn.;
A.E. Montana Inc., of Amsterdam, Mont.; Shreveport Ethanol Inc., of
Shreveport, La.; and Alpebo Inc., of Jennings, La.

   A federal bankruptcy judge granted a one-week
extention today to Eastern Airlines and its creditors to devise
plans for a sale or restructuring, but he warned delays were
devouring the strike-crippled carrier.
   The order by Judge Burton Lifland came as lawyers for pilots and
Eastern confirmed the existence of another possible bidder besides
the three previously known: ex-baseball boss Peter Ueberroth,
hotelier Jay Pritzker and takeover investor Carl Icahn. But the
lawyers wouldn't identify the fourth bidder.
   Directors of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. meanwhile, said
they have decided it should no longer pursue the sale of Eastern
but will consider selling ``a substantial part of the company's
assets'' to pay its debts.
   The Texas Air board's statement essentially approved Eastern
management's decision last Wednesday, after a deal with Ueberroth
fell through, to reduce Eastern to about 60 percent of its
pre-strike size.
   ``As time goes by there are fewer alternatives to explore,''
Lifland told a Manhattan courtroom crammed with about 50 uniformed
pilots and lawyers for Texas Air, creditors and the striking unions.
   ``This airline is hemorrhaging,'' he said. ``It is not tolerable
that this process be so lengthy that the parties have nothing left
to consider.''
   Burton had called a hearing today requesting that management,
creditors and the unions show cause why he shouldn't put the entire
airline up for auction, including assets owned by Eastern before
Texas Air bought it three years ago.
   ``We are not here selling a used car at a foreclosure sale,''
creditors committee attorney Joel Zweibel told the judge. ``We are
selling a complicated business.''
   At the urging of Zweibel and lawyers for Eastern management,
Lifland gave them one more week to negotiate and review possible
options for the Miami-based airline, one of the nation's largest
and most unprofitable. He set a new hearing for 11 a.m. next Monday.
   Lifland granted the delay over the objection of attorneys for
the unions and a dissident creditor who sought the hearing. They
have been pushing for more aggressive court action to get Eastern
flying again, either through a sale or the appointment of an
outsider to run the airline. Eastern management has said it wants
to restructure into a much smaller operation.
   Eastern workers have been on strike since March 4, charging
Texas Air boss Frank Lorenzo has butchered it and plotted to
destroy their unions by transferring valuable assets to sister
carrier Continental Airlines.
   Lorenzo put Eastern into bankruptcy court refuge March 9 and
sought a buyer. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner and
Olympics organizer, nearly completed a $464 million deal to buy
Eastern but the sale collapsed.
   However, sources familiar with the Eastern situation have said
Ueberroth remains interested in making a new offer. Pritzker, owner
of the Hyatt hotel chain, and Icahn, chairman of Trans World
Airlines, also have been lurking in the background as possible
buyers.
   After the Lifland hearing today, pilots union attorney Bruce
Simon and Eastern attorney Harvey Miller told reporters there was a
fourth bidder.
   In a statement issued today, Lorenzo was quoted as saying the
Texas Air board believes a sale of Eastern ``is not in Texas Air or
Eastern's best interests or in the best interests of Eastern's
creditors.''
   The board made the decision at a meeting this morning and its
vote was unrelated to Lifland's action today, Texas Air spokesman
Art Kent said from the company's headquarters in Houston.
   The statement said: ``In order to resolve promptly the Eastern
situation, Texas Air had been willing to agree to a quick sale
(even at a price which did not nearly reflect Eastern's net asset
value) and had selected the prospective buyer _ the group led by
Peter Ueberroth _ who it believed was most likely to be able to
consummate a transaction promptly.
   ``With the collapse of those efforts, because of totally
unreasonable and unworkable union demands, Texas Air has determined
that further sale efforts are unlikely to be successful, and in
fact, would be counterproductive.''
   Pritzker resurfaced Friday with a $500 million proposal to buy
Eastern, which his representatives presented to the 15-member
committee of Eastern's major creditors, sources close to the
situation said. Ueberroth remained interested in reviving his bid,
and Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc.,
talked to union officials this weekend about a possible deal, said
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Lawyers representing Eastern and its unions also met during the
weekend, but little of significance was said to have emerged from
the talks.
   ``Parameters were being drawn,'' said one participant who
insisted on anonymity.

<TEXT>
   It's a long way from Wall Street to the
6th floor of Bridgeport Superior Court, but a lawsuit being heard
here is being closely watched by stockbrokers.
   Closing arguments are to begin Tuesday in a legal dispute that
pits PaineWebber Inc. against one of the so-called ``superbrokers''
it hired away from competitors in the early 1980s, most from Lehman
Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc.
   Five of the brokers were fired in 1984. They filed suit against
PaineWebber and its parent, PaineWebber Group Inc., claiming the
investment firm lured them away just to capture their multimillion
dollar client base.
   Four of the brokers agreed to arbitration before the case could
go to trial in federal court in Manhattan, but Geoffrey J. Winters
pursued the case and is asking for at least $16 million in damages.
He claims he was fired unjustly.
   The case ended up in the Connecticut courts after PaineWebber
obtained a lien against Winters' Greenwich home to recover a
$300,000 signing bonus he was to repay if he was fired within four
years because of poor performance.
   Perrin Long, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.
in New York, said Wall Street is watching the case with interest
largely because it is highly unsual for brokers to sue their former
employers.
   ``If there is any disagreement, they try to settle it ...
in-house,'' he said Monday. ``They are watching this very closely
... to see whether the suit sets a precedent for future suits.''
   Winters, 46, calls PaineWebber's actions outrageous.
   Alan R. Spirer, an attorney representing PaineWebber, says
Winters has failed to prove the brokerage house did anything
malicious or false.
   The case had its origins in October 1982, when Winters left
Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, now Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., to join
PaineWebber. He and other new employees were touted as
``superbrokers'' in brochures PaineWebber sent out to potential
customers.
   The brokers earned the nickname because each had produced more
than $1 million in annual commissions.
   When he joined PaineWebber, Winters was given two promissary
notes, one for $240,000 and another for $60,000, that were secured
by an advance compensation agreement. The principal amounts for
both were due in five years without interest.
   But on March 23, 1984, PaineWebber fired Winters for alleged
willful misconduct.
   After Winters filed his original lawsuit in New York,
PaineWebber went to court in Connecticut seeking to collect on its
promissary notes.
   Winters denied that he owed PaineWebber any money and filed
seven counterclaims, seeking damages for breach of employment
contract, false and fraudulent promises and defamatory statements.
   PaineWebber won a judgment against Winters who appealed to the
state Supreme Court. The court granted him a new trial in March
1988.
   Winter's attorney, John H. Chaman, and Spirer told the judge
they had agreed on most points to be covered in the final arguments
and would be ready for the arguments Tuesday.
   Spirer also has asked the court to dimiss Winters' counterclaims
before the case gets to the jury.
   Judge Dennis F. Harrigan reserved a decision on the request. He
indicated he would rule after hearing the closing arguments.

   In a growing movement to force
corporations to disclose more information about animal
experimentation, animal-rights activists are taking their fight
directly to shareholders.
   This year, shareholders at 10 companies will vote on resolutions
proposed by animal-rights activists, an increase of two over 1988,
according to the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research
Center.
   ``It's a thoughtful and sophisticated way to encourage companies
to seriously consider questions of humane treatment of animals in
connection with their business,'' said attorney Alan Lovenheim, who
has represented about a dozen groups seeking animal-rights
resolutions.
   Corporations generally have opposed the proxy resolutions.
   After years of fruitless picketing against U.S. Surgical Corp.'s
use of dogs in product tests, activists secured a resolution on the
company's proxy ballot for its May 2 annual meeting demanding a
halt to the tests.
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has proxy
resolutions asking eight corporations _ American Home Products
Corp., Avon Products Inc., Bristol-Meyer Co., Colgate-Palmolive
Co., Gillette Co., Greyhound Corp., Schering-Plough Corp. and
Johnson &amp; Johnson _ to cite progress in developing alternatives to
animal testing.
   For the third year, International Business Machines Corp. has
included an animal-rights resolution on its ballot.
   The proposal, filed by an individual shareholder, simply asks
the company to disclose information on animal experiments that it
may conduct. IBM has opposed the resolution.
   On all issues, 170 proxy resolutions have been proposed this
year, about half dealing with South Africa, according to the
Investor Responsibility Research Center, which monitors
shareholders' resolutions.
   In 1985, Lovenheim successfully sued Greenwich-based Iroquois
Brands Ltd., in which he held stock, to get his animal-rights
resolution included for vote in the company's proxy ballot.
Lovenheim wanted to know whether the French farmers who supplied
the company with goose liver were treating the fowl humanely.
   The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
drafted a resolution for the McDonald's Corp. proxy ballot this
year, but withdrew it after McDonald's agreed to assess farming
practices used to produce its meat and eggs.
   ``It was gratifying this year to find McDonald's was willing to
sit down and discuss the proposal,'' said Lovenheim, who
represented the ASPCA.
   Lovenheim said the Securities and Exchange Commission has
supported every resolution he has proposed or defended, despite
corporate objections.
   The New England Anti-Vivisection Society last week filed suit in
federal court in Boston against Norwalk-based U.S. Surgical,
charging the company used false information in recommending that a
resolution calling for suspension of animal testing be rejected.
   The society has owned 66 shares of U.S. Surgical, which
manufactures surgical products, since 1983.
   U.S. Surgical has been a target of protests by animal-rights
groups for years, but the dispute drew national attention in
November, when an animal activist allegedly planted a
remote-controlled bomb outside the company's headquarters.
   Authorities said animal activist Fran Trutt of New York City
intended to detonate the bomb and kill U.S. Surgical Chairman Leon
Hirsch. No one was injured in the incident. Trutt is awaiting trial
on a charge of attempted murder.

<HEAD>1st-Qtr Profit Rises at Tribune, McGraw-Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tribune Co. said Monday its first-quarter earnings rose 14
percent from a year ago, while another media concern, McGraw-Hill
Inc., said an accounting change turned what would have been an
earnings decline into a 15.6 percent increase.
   The Chicago-based Tribune Co. said it earned $36.8 million, or
49 cents a share, in the three months ended March 26 compared with
$32.2 million, or 42 cents a share, in the same 1988 period.
   First-quarter revenue rose 6 percent to $553 million from $522
million in 1988.
   Tribune said its operating profit from newspapers including the
Chicago Tribune rose 19 percent to $61.6 million as revenue rose 5
percent to $394 million.
   Its broadcasting and entertainment group had an operating loss
of $1.4 million in contrast with a loss of $3.5 million in the same
quarter in 1988 despite a 15 percent rise in revenue to $105
million.
   The division includes six TV stations, five radio stations, a
syndicated TV news program and the Chicago Cubs baseball team.
   Operating profit from its newsprint operations fell 27 percent
to $16.7 million on steady revenue of $109 million.
   McGraw-Hill, based in New York, said its profit rose to $31.2
million, or 64 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31
compared $27 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 5.2 percent to $416 million from $396
million a year earlier.
   The publishing and information services concern said an
accounting change involving income taxes boosted its first-quarter
profit by $8 million, the cumulative effect of the accounting
change in previous years.
   It said without the change, made in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board standards, the company's profit would
have fallen 14 percent.
   McGraw-Hill said its pre-tax income tumbled 27.8 percent,
reflecting sale of assets including a professional training system,
healthcare publications and an accounting software business. That
was partially offset by tax benefits from those sales, the company
said.
   Its publishing division which includes Business Week magazine,
four television stations and its educational publishing business
had an operating loss of $8.1 million in contrast with a loss of
$3.3 million a year earlier.
   The wider operating loss reflected costs of starting a new
reading series and the acquisition of Random House's college and
school divisions for $200 million last December.
   The operating profit at its information services division fell
13.2 percent to $28.8 million. That division provides data in a
variety of forms to the construction, legal, aerospace and energy
markets among others.
   McGraw-Hill's financial services unit had an operating profit of
$28.2 million, up 34.3 percent from a year earlier. That division
includes the Standard &amp; Poor's debt ratings as well as equity and
commodity information.

<HEAD>Chase, Hanover Report Earnings Drop; Security Pacific Has Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chase Manhattan Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. reported
Monday that their first-quarter profit fell sharply over a year
ago, while another large banking concern, Security Pacific Corp.
posted a healthy gain in earnings.
   Chase, the nation's second largest bank holding company, based
in New York, said it netted $132 million, or $1.27 a share, for the
three months ended March 31, a 52 percent drop from earnings of
$277 million, or $3.09 a share, in 1988.
   The company said last year's income included $161 million from
asset sales and income tax benefits.
   No. 5 Security Pacific, based in Los Angeles, said it earned
$179.3 million, or $1.54 a share, in the quarter, up 22 percent
from $147.2 million, or $1.30 a share, in the first quarter of 1988.
   Manufacturers Hanover, ranked seventh and based in New York,
posted a 27 percent decline in its quarterly profit, to $103
million, or $1.84 a share, from $141 million, or $2.56 a share.
   The 1988 quarter included $40 million from tax benefits and the
sale of one of its subsidaries.
   Chase said it had higher net interest income and an increase in
fees but they were partly offset by lower income from foreign
exchange and other trading activities. The company's provision for
credit losses stood at $150 million in the quarter, the same as a
year ago.
   First-quarter net interest income totaled $797.04 million, up 9
percent from $732.34 million last year.
   Non-interest income fell 34 percent to $420.24 million from
$633.42 million, while non-interest expenses rose 2 percent to
$876.01 million from $$855.74 million.
   Security Pacific said its net interest income totaled $733.8
million, up from $631.4 million a year earlier. Non-interest income
was $431.6 million, up from $421 million in the first quarter of
last year. Non-interest expense totaled $755.4 million, vs. $730.0
million last year.
   Manufacturers Hanover said its net interest income totaled $466
million, compared with $495 million a year ago. Non-interest income
fell to $317 million from $375 million, while non-interest expenses
fell 4 percent to $509 million from $528 million.

   The stock market closed narrowly mixed in light,
featureless trading today, as investors turned cautious ahead of
Tuesday's consumer price report.
   The market opened lower, rebounded briefly then edged downward
through the remainder of the session as many participants retreated
to await the latest economic data.
   Analysts said the market is expecing a rise of between 0.4
percent and 0.6 percent in the consumer price index, which is a
gauge of the cost of living. In February, consumer prices rose 0.4
percent.
   ``The whole world revolved around that number today,'' said Jack
Baker, analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``People were
reluctant to take positions pending the outcome.''
   On Friday, the market had rallied sharply after the government
reported that the producer price index rose 0.4 percent in March.
The market interpreted the data as good news after rises of 1
percent in each of the previous two months.
   Economists said the PPI, a measure of inflation at the wholesale
level, was in line with other data that suggested the economy is
slowing and that the Federal Reserve probably would not be pushing
interest rates up in the immediate future.
   ``People realized that Friday might have been too much too
soon,'' said Philip Puccio, senior vice president at Dillon, Read &amp;
Co.
   Even before trading activity slowed, analysts said volume was
fairly light with many players taking the week off in preparation
for the Jewish holiday of Passover on Wednesday.

   Gasoline prices soared to three-year highs
Monday amid continued worries about supplies following the Alaskan
oil spill.
   The gasoline rally, which included a 2-cent-a-gallon increase,
helped push up prices of crude oil and other refined petroleum
products traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Andrew Lebow, a senior energy analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said the rise in gasoline futures
largely reflects concern about whether supply will meet growing
demand as the summer driving season approaches.
   ``Those concerns are globally,'' Lebow said.
   Supply worries escalated after an Exxon oil tanker spilled 10
million gallons of oil in Valdez, Alaska, last month, temporarily
choking off crucial oil shipping lanes.
   In the three weeks following the March 24 spill, gasoline prices
on the retail level jumped 10 to 30 cents a gallon across the
country.
   On the New York Merc, the May contract for wholesale unleaded
gasoline jumped 2.06 cents to 72.08 cents a gallon Monday, after
rising 1.21 cents on Friday.
   Lebow said Monday's closing price was the highest since the
first quarter of 1986.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 53 cents to $21.22 a 42-gallon
barrel, after a 40-cent increase on Friday.
   May wholesale home heating oil settled at 53.76 cents a gallon,
up 0.85 cent. The contract had risen 0.77 cent Friday.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. marketing firm said Monday it
will sell 1,500 laptop computers made in Hong Kong to the Soviet
Union for use by reporters for Tass News Service.
   Holographic Systems Inc. said the Defense Department tried to
block the $2.1 million sale of computers with Cyrillic keyboards
but received Commerce Department approval.
   The computers, made by Bondwell International of Hong Kong and
Fremont, Calif., use Intel Corp.'s 80286 chip and are more powerful
than the laptops most commonly used by American reporters.
   The Defense Department initially objected to the sale, citing
the quantity of computers and complaining they were ``ruggedized''
for possible use in military situations.
   Glenn G. Smith, president of Holographic Systems, denied the
charge. He said the deal went through recently after the Defense
Department failed to file a further objection following a
recommendation for approval by Commerce.
   Smith, who also is negotiating a joint venture with the Soviet
Ministry of Railways for a $20 million executive center and health
fitness club for foreign executives, said the laptop sale took
three months to get an export license.
   ``The government ought to find a way to expedite the licensing
and get the Defense Department out of some of these non-strategic
items, like (personal computers),'' Smith said. ``The Soviets can
go to Singapore and get a license in seven days.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar lost ground Monday against most other
major currencies in worldwide foreign exchange trading tempered by
anticipation of yet another report due Tuesday on U.S. inflation.
   Gold prices edged up in New York trading after falling overseas.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted an after-hours bid for
gold at $385.30 a troy ounce, up 30 cents from Friday's late bid.
   Traders have grown increasingly uncertain about the prospects
for the dollar as recent U.S. economic reports provided an
inconclusive view of the economy. The U.S. trade deficit widened in
February, but the growth in producer prices slowed in March and the
level of industrial production held steady.
   Traders were looking to Tuesday's scheduled release on the
consumer price index for March to see if inflation is slowing.
   ``We won't see any major direction until we see the CPI
number,'' said Jack Barbanel, manager of futures trading at Gruntal
&amp; Co. in New York.
   He said trading was relatively quiet and there was no sign of
central bank intervention in the currency markets.
   ``Foreign currencies are begining to generate an upswing and we
may see a little bit of correction against the dollar in the short
term. But in the long term, we still see the dollar relatively
strong,'' he said.
   Barbanel said he did not think the Federal Reserve would tighten
credit conditions on the basis of a strong consumer price rise
alone because the producer price figure showed slower growth in
March.
   ``That gives short-term rates a respite for a while,'' he said.
   Rising U.S. interest rates usually give the dollar a lift.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 131.83 Japanese yen from 132.55 yen
on Friday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 131.70 yen. In New
York, the dollar edged up to 132.155 yen from 132.05 yen late
Friday.
   But the dollar finished lower against most other major
currencies.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7095 Monday from $1.7000
late Friday. In New York, the pound rose to $1.7133 from $1.7055
late Friday.
   Other dollar rates as of 4 p.m. in New York, compared with late
rates Friday, included: 1.8605 West German marks, down from
1.86525; 6.3005 French francs, down from 6.3090; 1.6405 Swiss
francs, 1.6465; 1,366.35 Italian lire, down from 1,368.63; and
1.18495, down from 1.18605.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with Friday's late
rates, included: 1.8565 West German marks, down from 1.8725; 1.6385
Swiss francs, down from 1.6510; 6.2825 French francs, down from
6.3350; 2.0953 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1145; 1,364.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,374.25; 1.1855 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1875.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
edged up 20 cents a troy ounce to close at $386.20 an ounce.
   Earlier, gold traded at $385.00 a troy ounce in London, down
from $386.50 late Friday. The late bid in Zurich was $384.50 an
ounce, down from $387.00 on Friday. In Hong Kong, gold closed at
$385.65 an ounce, down from $382.65.
   Silver for current delivery rose to close at $5.811 an ounce on
the Comex in New York, up from $5.805 late Friday. Silver bullion
traded late in London at a bid $5.80 a troy ounce, down from $5.89
late Friday.

<HEAD>Palladium Prices Tumble; Profit-Taking Cited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Palladium futures prices came crashing down Monday from 8-year
highs as speculators took profits and lowered their expectations
that nuclear fusion research would lead to explosive demand for the
metal.
   Platinum futures also declined sharply while gold and silver
advanced.
   On other markets, petroleum futures soared; grains and soybeans
were sharply higher; and most livestock and meat futures also
advanced.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, all palladium contracts
except the spot April contract fell the permitted daily limit of $6
a troy ounce. The April contract, which has no limit pending its
upcoming expiration, plunged $12.30 to $168.35 an ounce.
   Platinum settled $18 to $18.50 lower with July at $550.70 a troy
ounce.
   Both metals were components in a University of Utah chemistry
experiment, announced on March 23, in which researchers claimed to
have recreated in a bottle the elusive nuclear reaction that powers
the sun and stars.
   The discovery raised hopes that nuclear fusion could become a
major energy source.
   Last Thursday, palladium rocketed to an 8-year-high and platinum
surged to its highest price in four months as other scientists
replicated the Utah experiment.
   But the speculative fever began cooling Friday and disappeared
Monday morning amid media reports that the fusion research was not
likely to create significantly stronger demand for palladium and
platinum.
   Fred Demler, metals economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
in New York, said both markets had become ``sorely overbought and
due for a correction.''
   Gold and silver futures inched higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange in light, cautious trading ahead of Tuesday's government
report on consumer price movement during April.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 30 cents higher with June at $390.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 0.6 cent higher with May at
$5.83 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil prices spurted above $21 a barrel on the New York Merc
for the first time in 20 months.
   Analysts said the buying was inspired by chart signals rather
than new supply-and-demand developments. The rally was led by the
unleaded gasoline market, which has been moving higher since
mid-February.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 53 cents
higher with May at $21.22 a barrel; heating oil was .85 cent to
1.19 cents higher with May at 53.76 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.05 cents to 2.06 cents higher with May at 72.08
cents a gallon.
   Corn and soybean futures surged on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid forecasts for dry and much warmer weather in the western Corn
Belt later this week.
   Many traders remember the dramatic price increases for corn and
soybeans that accompanied last summer's drought, and each day
without rain in the Midwest bolsters the bullish trend despite the
fact that farmers in the region have barely begun their spring
planting.
   ``This is awfully early to be having a weather rally,'' said
Susan Leighty, a grain-market analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents lower to 3{ cents higher with May at
$4.10\ a bushel; corn was 5{ cents to 6{ cents higher with May at
$2.76} a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 7\ cents higher with May at
$1.99 a bushel; soybeans were 10 cents to 15{ cents higher with May
at $7.47\ a bushel.
   Higher cash prices for fed cattle fueled a moderate rally in
cattle futures prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and helped
lift pork futures prices.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .62 cent higher with June at
71.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .65 cent higher
with May at 76.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to
.55 cent higher with June at 46.62 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .32 cent to 1.20 cents higher with May at 33.62 cents
a pound.

<HEAD>Ford's Mustang Turns 25</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With fanfare and a closed-circuit
broadcast, Ford Motor Co. patted itself on the back Monday for the
Mustang, introduced 25 years ago as an inexpensive sporty car that
took the country by storm.
   ``It spawned a whole new class of cars,'' said Michael Marsden,
a professor of pop culture at Bowling Green State University who
was on hand for the birthday party. ``The (Chevrolet) Camaro
wouldn't exist if the Mustang hadn't come along.''
   On April 17, 1964, about five weeks after the first one rolled
off the line at the Dearborn assembly plant, the Mustang was
introduced formally. Living up to the executives' promises, it
weighed 2,570 pounds and cost $2,368.
   Since that day, Ford has built and sold more than 5.7 million
Mustangs, making millions of dollars off the cars. Its best sales
year was in 1966, when 549,000 of the cars were sold. Its worst
sales year was 1983, when 117,000 Mustangs were driven off dealers'
lots.
   The first Mustang, now in the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, was
sold to an airplane pilot in St. Johns, Newfoundland, in April
1964. The pilot, Stanley Tucker now of Montreal, was convinced by
Ford to trade in Job 1 for Job 1,000,001 two years later, so that
the original could be preserved.
   On Monday, Ford rolled out a vintage Mustang as officials and
workers gathered to cut a cake in the shape of a Ford oval and
topped by an edible model of a Mustang. Behind the ceremony,
Mustangs continued to be assembled, at a rate of 52 an hour.
   The executives were brought to the plant's finishing area in
Mustangs, of course, to the beat of Wilson Pickett's tune ``Mustang
Sally.'' The ceremony was telecast live to all Ford plants in the
United States and Canada through an in-house broadcast system.
   Plant Manager Lou Callaway, who began his Ford career at the
Dearborn assembly plant and got a rousing cheer Monday when he
stepped from a new Mustang, said in an interview before the
birthday party there was a feeling that the car would do well even
before it was introduced.
   ``You can always tell when a car is going to be successful,'' he
said, ``because the employees are excited about it.''
   One of the employees there when the first Mustang rolled off the
line, and who is still working at the plant is Milton Bevins, 62,
whose enthusiasm for the car continues.
   ``We make the best cars in America,'' said Bevins, whose family
has had three Mustangs _ a blue 1966, a blue '78 and a brown '80.
They were all driven by other members of his family.
   ``I have a '77 (Ford) Grenada,'' he said. ``I refer to it as my
truck.''

<HEAD>Judge Lets Stand Injunction Against Takeover Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday refused to modify an
order preventing the free world's largest gold concern, South
Africa-linked Minorco S.A., from acquiring any more shares of No. 2
gold producer Consolidated Gold Fields PLC.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey continues
a preliminary injunction he issued last October barring Minorco
from acquiring the 70.4 percent of Gold Fields shares it doesn't
already own.
   Last fall, Minorco, a Luxembourg corporation largely controlled
by two South African concerns, Anglo American Corp. of South Africa
and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., launched a $4.9 billion
hostile takeover bid _ since upped to $6 billion _ for Consolidated
Gold Fields.
   But Gold Fields, a British concern, resisted and filed an
antitrust action in New York, claiming that a takeover could result
in Minorco's ``dominating the strategically important world gold
market.''
   ``This court enjoined the takeover because the resulting
combination would control 32.3 percent of the non-communist world
gold market,'' Mukasey said in a 45-page opinion issued Monday.
   Minorco, through its various holdings, is the largest gold
producer in the West, accounting for 20.3 percent of all
production. Gold Fields, with about a 12 percent share, is the
second-largest, according to court papers.
   Mukasey's injunction also prevents Minorco from selling its Gold
Fields holdings to other entities within the South African
conglomerate without court approval.
   Minorco sought to modify the injunction, allowing it to complete
its acquisition of Gold Fields while promising to sell off certain
U.S., Australian and South African assets within a year to resolve
antitrust allegations made by Gold Fields.
   But Mukasey rejected that bid saying there was no guarantee that
Anglo and DeBeers wouldn't eventually repurchase the divested
concerns because South African laws enable companies there ``to
conceal the source of their overseas investments in order to avoid
the effects of anti-apartheid laws.''
   Last month, a federal appeals court upheld Mukasey's preliminary
injunction on antitrust grounds and ordered him to consider whether
the takeover bid violates U.S. securities laws.
   In Monday's ruling, however, Mukasey rejected Gold Fields'
claims that Minorco had failed to fully disclose its South African
interests in violation of U.S. securities laws.
   Gold Fields sought to widen the scope of the injunction by
claiming Minorco violated the anti-fraud provisions of U.S.
securities laws, for allegedly ``making and false and misleading
statements'' about how much control South African corporations and
individuals have over it.
   Gold Fields claimed the Oppenheimer family of South Africa
indirectly controls Minorco, Anglo American and DeBeers and that
the stigma of South Africa's apartheid racial policy could make it
difficult to conduct business in some countries.
   But Mukasey found those claims were only part of a delaying
tactic to push Minorco's offer past its April 26 deadline, which
under British law would bar it from renewing its bid for more than
a year.
   Gold Fields has significant gold mining holdings in South
Africa, Australia and the United States, including 90 percent of
Newmont Gold, the largest gold producer in the country.

   Sculley said some hot new technologies are too expensive and
untried to be offered by Apple itself, although other companies may
offer them as add-ons to the popular Apple Macintosh.
   Apple will offer the new technologies on the Macintosh once they
become cheaper and better accepted, he said.
   As examples he cited artificial intelligence and digital signal
processing chips, which take voices and video signals and turn them
into code that can be acted on by a computer.
   Sculley appeared to be staking out the middle ground of the
personal computer market as Apple's own, putting less emphasis on
the high ground where Apple faces its sternest competition.
   Sun Microsystems last week unveiled a family of low-priced
Sparcstation computers that can zoom through more than 12 million
instructions per second.
   Steve Jobs, who co-founded Apple and went on to create Next
Inc., is pitching a speedy Next workstation that comes in an
elegant black magnesium box.
   Sculley said he does not foresee a collision between personal
computers and workstations, which are cousins of PCs that cost
more, run faster and have superior graphics.
   ``There are a lot of things you have to do to be successful in
the personal computer industry beyond offering hardware under
$10,000,'' Sculley said in a news conference.
   Sun's compact Sparcstation starts at less than $9,000. But
Sculley said it is still about twice the price of the new Macintosh
IIcx, which he described in an earlier speech as possibly the
company's best computer ever. And he said software for the Sun
machine is much more expensive than Macintosh software.
   Still, analysts say the Sun and Next machines are tough
competition for the most expensive Apple models, such as the
Macintosh IIx, which sells for $10,000 to $12,000.
   ``That's one of the reasons they want to emphasize the mid-range
of the products. The competition is getting pretty fierce at the
high end,'' said Laura Lederman, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
   She said she was concerned that waiting too long to put new
technologies into the Macintosh could leave Apple playing catch-up.
``I don't think they're really any longer at the forefront of
technology.''
   Sculley gave the keynote address at the Macintosh Business
Conference and Exposition, which was billed as the biggest
Macintosh event ever in New York. He followed the speech with a
news conference.

   The stock market closed mixed in one of the
slowest trading days of the year Monday, as investors hibernated to
await more news on the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 0.73 point to
2,337.79 after opening more than 4 points lower.
   In the broader market, declining issues narrowly outnumbered
advancers in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
issues, with 762 issues down, 697 up and 521 unchanged.
   Stocks initially fell on profit-taking in the wake of Friday's
surge in prices, rebounded briefly then drifted through the
remainder of the session as players retreated to await a government
report Tuesday on consumer prices.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 128.54 million
shares, the fifth slowest trading day of the year, down from 169.78
million in the previous session.
   Analysts said despite Friday's price rally after a report that
March producer prices rose 0.4 percent, market participants
preferred to remain cautious ahead of new statistics on the
consumer price index.
   ``After the party on Friday and the CPI tomorrow, people are
just taking the day off,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president
of A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``They don't want to come
in tomorrow and be hit with a Mike Tyson left hook.''
   The market interpreted the producer price rise as a sign of
easing inflationary pressures after rises of 1 percent in each of
the previous two months. Stock analysts said the market is
expecting a rise of between 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent in the
March CPI, which measures cost of living, after a 0.4 percent
increase in February.
   Even before trading slowed, analysts said activity was light
with many participants taking the week off in preparation for the
Jewish holiday of Passover on Wednesday.
   ``That tends to lower the volume as people close out
positions,'' said Philip Puccio, senior vice president at Dillon,
Read &amp; Co. ``They want to get out of the week relatively
unscathed.''
   With the exception of individual stocks, no one particular
sector stood out, traders said.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 155.002 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $2.61 billion, or 0.09
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.16 to 169.05.
   Among actively traded issues, AT&amp;T rose { to 32\, Burlington
Resources gained 1 to 46} and McClatchy Newspapers advanced 1| to
19\ after news of the death of C.K. McClatchy, its chairman and
chief executive, apparently sparked takeover speculation, brokers
said.
   Control Data, meanwhile, fell ~ to 21{, Reynolds Metals lost 1~

   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.25 to 348.01, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index advanced 0.36 to 301.72.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.08 to 417.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 336.22, up 0.40.

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising sales in TRW Inc.'s automotive and
information systems segments helped lead to a first-quarter
earnings increase of 4 percent, the company said Monday.
   TRW said earnings during the period that ended March 31 totaled
$69 million or $1.12 a share, up from $66 million or $1.07 during
the same quarter a year ago.
   ``Each of our major segments reported operating profits equal to
or better than the year-earlier period when we experienced
particularly strong results,'' said Joseph T. Gorman, chairman and
chief executive officer. ``This quarter's earnings improvement was
attained in what we believe was a much tougher competitive
environment.''
   TRW said sales in its space and defense segment dropped 5
percent from $815 to $775 million because of previously announced
program changes and reductions. However, operating profit in that
segment rose nearly 2 percent from $58 million to $59 million, the
company said.
   Sales in the automotive segment rose 10 percent from $787
million to $868 million, TRW said, attributing the increase to
improved business in North America, Europe, Brazil and Japan.
Operating profit in the segment remained at $745 million, TRW said.
   In the information systems segment, sales rose 12 percent from
$126 million to $141 million, TRW said. It noted particularly
strong performances in the consumer credit reporting and
image-based data processing businesses. Operating profit rose 51
percent from $9 million to $13 million in information systems, the
company said.
   TRW, which provides high technology produces and services, said
sales overall for the quarter dropped 1 percent from $1.8 billion
to $1.79 billion. Excluding sales for businesses divested last
year, sales rose 4 percent, TRW said.

   A federal bankruptcy judge gave Eastern Airlines
and its creditors an extra week Monday to invite buyers and explore
a possible breakup, but parent Texas Air Corp. said the
strike-strapped airline wasn't for sale.
   The developments added a new twist to the Miami-based airline's
tortuous labor crisis, now in its seventh week, and suggested a
solution was growing more elusive.
   ``As time goes by there are fewer alternatives to explore,''
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland told a Manhattan courtroom
crammed with about 50 uniformed pilots and lawyers for Texas Air,
creditors and the unions.
   ``This airline is hemorrhaging,'' he said. ``It is not tolerable
that this process be so lengthy that the parties have nothing left
to consider.''
   Bruce Simon, an attorney for the pilots union, told a news
conference that Texas Air ``appears to be in an especial state of
disarray,'' with the company and its lawyers giving conflicting
signals about their planned course of action.
   Lifland held a hearing to determine why he shouldn't put the
entire airline up for sale, including assets held by Eastern before
Texas Air acquired it three years ago for about $676 million.
   Lawyers for Eastern and its creditors talked him into giving
them an extra week to study alternatives, over the objection of
attorneys for the unions and a dissident creditor, Atlanta attorney
Moreton Rolleston, Jr. They have been pushing for more aggressive
court action to get Eastern flying again, either through a sale or
the appointment of an outside trustee to run the airline.
   After the hearing, lawyers for Eastern and the pilots union said
there was another possible bidder besides the three previously
known: ex-baseball boss Peter Ueberroth, hotelier Jay Pritzker and
takeover investor Carl Icahn. They wouldn't identify the fourth
bidder.
   Simon said David I. Shapiro, the bankruptcy examiner for
Eastern, described the fourth bidder to the lawyers involved as ``a
group of substantial capital willing and able to do the
transaction.'' Shapiro told the lawyers Monday he had been in
contact with all four potential suitors, Simon said.
   The judge's order meant that during the week, potential buyers
would gain access to confidential financial data concerning Eastern
in exchange for their pledge to keep the information secret,
participants in the case said.
   Joel Zweibel, the lead attorney for the 15-member committee
representing Eastern's creditors, said the Miami-based airline has
agreed to provide the necessary financial documents.
   ``There might be someone who's interested at the right price,''
said Eastern attorney Harvey Miller.
   Texas Air, however, said its directors had decided not to pursue
the sale of Eastern but will consider selling ``a substantial part
of the company's assets'' to pay down debts.
   The Texas Air board's statement essentially sanctioned Eastern
management's decision announnced last Wednesday, after a deal with
Ueberroth collapsed, to reduce Eastern to about 60 percent of its
pre-strike size. Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said the statement
was unrelated to Lifland's hearing.
   Eastern workers have been on strike since March 4, charging
Texas Air boss Frank Lorenzo has butchered it and plotted to
destroy their unions by transferring valuable assets to sister
carrier Continental Airlines.
   Lorenzo put Eastern into bankruptcy court refuge March 9 and
sought a buyer. Ueberroth nearly completed a $464 million deal to
buy Eastern but the sale flopped over a dispute between the unions
and Lorenzo over who would run the airline until Ueberroth's
investor group could assume control.
   Sources familiar with the Eastern situation have said Ueberroth
remains interested in making a new offer. Pritzker, owner of the
Hyatt hotel chain, and Icahn, owner and chairman of Trans World
Airlines Inc., also have been lurking in the background as possible
buyers.
   The Lifland hearing was jammed with interested bystanders. Among
them was former Pan Am Corp. chairman Ed Acker, who declined to say
why he was there.

<HEAD>California Court Revives Suit Against Oil Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Monday allowed
the state of California to go to trial with claims that six major
oil companies conspired to depress the price of oil they pumped
from state-owned tidelands in Long Beach.
   The suits in federal and state court claim losses to the state
and the city of Long Beach totaling $789 million in 1971-77 and
1980-85. Damages tripled under antitrust law would exceed $2.3
billion, and could be increased further by $2,500-a-day penalties
sought under state unfair-competition laws.
   Most of the claimed losses were to the state, which uses
tidelands oil money for school construction. The city of Long Beach
gets a small fraction of the oil money.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 3-0 to reinstate the
suits, which had been dismissed by U.S. District Judge William Gray
of Los Angeles.
   The suits accuse the six companies _ Standard Oil Co. of
California, Texaco Inc., Union Oil, Mobil Corp., Shell Oil Co. and
Exxon Corp. _ of holding down the prices they paid for heavy crude
oil while agreeing secretly to exchange oil among themselves at
higher prices. A seventh defendant, Atlantic Richfield Co., settled
in 1984 by paying $22.5 million.
   Still pending before the appellate court is an appeal by
California and four other states from a ruling by Gray dismissing a
separate antitrust suit against the same seven oil companies, which
accuses them of conspiring to create a gasoline shortage and fix
gasoline prices in the early 1970s.
   In Monday's ruling, the court said the state and city had
presented enough evidence to proceed to trial with claims that the
oil companies conspired to keep artificially low the prices they
paid to Long Beach for heavy crude oil.
   Royce Schulz, a lawyer for the city, said retail prices for oil
products in California were about the same as those elsewhere in
the period, an indication that the companies' actions didn't help
consumers.
   ``Refiners simply pocketed that profit,'' he said.
   The suits contend the companies agreed secretly in the early
1960s, at meetings involving all of them except Exxon, to keep the
posted price for heavy crude below its real value, while exchanging
different grades of oil among themselves at higher rates.
   Lawyers for Long Beach said the elaborate exchange procedure,
unique to California, was disclosed by a state auditor in 1973 but
was being used as late as 1984.
   Types of oil ``were used as a currency _ a medium of exchange
and a new value system _ reserved to the majors (oil companies) and
kept secret from the state and the city,'' Schulz said in a
``background paper'' on the case.
   Gary Halling, another partner in Schulz's firm, said the secrecy
of the exchange system let the oil companies evade a provision of
their contract with Long Beach that required them to pay the city
the highest price they paid any other seller of oil.
   But David Destino, a lawyer for Exxon, said the exchange system
simply allowed oil companies to move their product to market while
guaranteeing that they would get equal value when trading the same
grade of oil from different sources.
   The appeals court said the exchange system did not amount to
price-fixing by itself but could point to the existence of a
conspiracy.
   ``At various times, market conditions should have caused some of
the companies to post higher crude prices,'' said the opinion by
Judge Jerome Farris. ``Posted prices did not correspond to market
value.''
   Farris also rejected Gray's conclusion that federal price
controls and other regulations during the 1971-77 period made it
impossible for the city and state to show any damages, even if they
could prove a price-fixing conspiracy.

   Holly Farms Corp., trying to block a $1.15
billion takeover by a rival poultry processor, said Monday it
failed to convince its stockholders to approve a merger Holly
managers proposed with ConAgra Inc. and would abandon the idea.
   Holly Farms said a preliminary count showed that only 32.5
percent of its stock was voted in favor of the merger with ConAgra
and 47.8 percent against it. The tally was taken Friday with a
two-thirds affirmative vote required.
   Ted Bailey, a Holly Farms vice president, said Holly notified
ConAgra on Monday that the merger was off.
   Holly Farms directors announced the proposed merger with Omaha,
Neb.-based ConAgra last November to ward off a takeover by Tyson
Foods Inc. of Springdale, Ark.
   ``They had to have a two-thirds vote and they didn't even get
one-third,'' Jim Blair, general counsel for Tyson, said of the
shareholder voting. ``I would hope the Holly board would start
paying a little attention to the wishes of their shareholders. I
think this is a mandate to take our deal.''
   The merger agreement included a provision aimed at allowing
ConAgra to purchase key Holly assets in the event the merger
failed. The ``asset-option agreement'' remains in effect, though it
has been temporarily blocked by Delaware Chancery Court on a
challenge by Tyson, Bailey said.
   The court also blocked another provision of the merger proposal
requiring Holly Farms to pay ConAgra $15 million, plus expenses, if
the deal failed.
   Walt Casey, a ConAgra vice president, said his company's
expenses for the merger attempt total $5 million.
   Casey said ConAgra still is interested in Holly Farms, but he
declined to say if his company will make a higher offer to counter
Tyson.
   Tyson is offering Holly stockholders $63.50 a share in cash for
their 18.1 million shares.
   The offer is contingent, however, on removal of the asset-option
agreement between ConAgra and Holly Farms.
   The ConAgra merger, which would have made Holly Farms a ConAgra
subsidiary, called for a $1.1 billion stock swap worth about $61 a
share.
   ``The board will be meeting and reviewing alternatives available
to shareolders and will be asking that the shareholders do nothing
in respect to their stock until they hear from the board,'' Bailey
said.
   Tyson Foods is the nation's largest poultry processor and Holly
Farms, a diversified company, is heavily involved in fresh poultry
sales. ConAgra is one of the largest food companies in the country
with revenues of $9.4 billion last year.
   The asset-option agreement between ConAgra and Holly Farms
allows ConAgra to purchase about one-third of Holly's assets at
prices already negotiated if the Memphis company is bought by
anyone else within the next nine months.
   Tyson contends the asset agreement was an illegal attempt to
make Holly Farms unattractive to any buyer other than ConAgra.
   The Delaware judge hearing Tyson's suit has blocked any
execution of the asset agreement until the legal disputes
surrounding it are settled.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday
gave a Pennsylvania nuclear plant permission to resume operations,
two years after it was shut down because 33 control room operators
slept on the job or neglected their duties.
   The NRC voted 3-0 to lift an order that had kept the Peach
Bottom nuclear plant closed since March 31, 1987, when the
commission said its continued operation Posed a threat ``to the
health and safety of the public.''
   In granting permission to restart the facility, the commission
nevertheless warned the plant operator against complacency. ``We
will be watching you very closely,'' said NRC Chairman Lando Zech.
   Plant officials must complete a checklist of technical items
before bringing the plant to full power, which will take several
months and be scrutinized by NRC inspectors.
   The vote followed a presentation by Philadelphia Electric Co.,
the plant operator, which said it had undergone radical changes
since the NRC issued its order following a tip about the sleeping
that prompted an investigation.
   The changes successfully addressed the ``root causes'' of the
problem, the NRC staff said in recommending that the commission
permit the plant to restart.
   Those problems had included a lax Peach Bottom ``culture'' in
which plant problems either were ignored or unnoticed by top
managers, the staff said.
   ``It would at least appear to me that management (before the
shutdown) either was not aware of conditions or, if they were aware
of it, they condoned it,'' Zech said before the vote.
   ``The operators must never again betray the special trust and
countenance of the public,'' Zech said. ``We will be watching you
very closely.''
   NRC Commissioner James Curtis was out of the country, and missed
the vote. Commissioner Kenneth Rogers did not vote because he once
served on the Philadelphia Electric board, the NRC said.
   The shutdown cost the company about $250 million in plant
modifications, purchases of replacement power and its share of a
$1.25 million fine, the largest in NRC history.
   Many of the problems at Peach Bottom occured on the overnight,
or ``graveyard'' shift.
   On at least two occasions, according to NRC testimony in 1987,
three of the four control room employees responsible for running
the plant were asleep at the same time. Another time, several of
the operators were found huddled around a personal computer playing
video games.
   Of 39 control room operators now at the plant, 24 were there at
the time of the shutdown, and all have been retrained. To end
catnaps by operators, plant officials also replaced comfortable,
high-backed chairs in the control room with low-backed models.
   In another development, meanwhile, Zech indicated the committee
would vote Thursday on awarding a full-power license to the
Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island, after hearing the NRC staff
report that the $5.5 billion reactor is safe and ready to operate.
   All indications are that the full-power license will be awarded,
but whether it will ever be used is doubtful. The Long Island
Lighting Co. is one step away from selling the plant to New York
state for $1 in exchange for a decade of annual rate increases of
up to 5 percent. The state would then decommission and dismantle
the plant.
   LILCO's board of directors is recommending that shareholders
approve the plan to shut the plant. The final step to ratifying the
settlement is a vote by LILCO shareholders on or before June 15. In
the meantime, LILCO has agreed not to operate the plant even if it
receives a 25 percent or full-power license before then.
   Shoreham, which was completed in 1984, 13 years behind schedule,
received a low-power testing license in 1985. But LILCO was
thwarted in its quest for an operating license because the state
and local governments refused to participate in emergency planning,
contending that area around the plant could not be safely evacuated
in the event of a nuclear emergency.
   In late 1987, the NRC changed its rules to allow utilities to
prepare their own evacuation plans assuming that in the event of a
real emergency, state and local governments would live up to their
responsibilities and participate. NRC finally removed LILCO's last
obstacles to a license _ the state and local governments _ by
dismissing them as legal intervenors before the NRC.

   Monday's midnight deadline for filing federal income tax returns
brought the usual deluge of last-minute mailings as people held
onto their money as long as possible, or procrastinated until time
ran out.
   The Postal Service took a tip from the fast food industry in
Columbus, Ohio, where traffic was directed through the front
parking lot of the city's main post office so people could drive
through and hand their completed returns to postal workers
stationed outside.
   ``Any returns we get by midnight, we'll make sure they get
postmarked on the 17th,'' said Debbie Rinehart, a mail processing
clerk at the Columbus main post office.
   People making the mad dash to beat the mailing deadline were
offered entertainment or moral support to improve their mood in
some cities.
   At Lawrence, Kan., the Lawrence Barnstorm Cloggers band was to
perform at the post office from 10 p.m. until midnight, said
spokeswoman Laurie Mackey.
   ``We just want to lift people's spirits,'' Mackey said.
   In Los Angeles, rock station KLSX-FM offered coffee and donuts
at the downtown Terminal Annex, the city's main mail processing
center, which posted buckets at curbside until midnight.
   ``We want to add some merriment and not make the people feel bad
that they're procrastinators,'' said KLSX disc jockey Peter Tilden.
   In Kansas City, Mo., a performance art group called The Stimulus
&amp; Response Co. prepared a show for its fourth annual Tax-a-thon
outside the city's main post office.
   ``At midnight, we release balloons and scream `It's too late!'
'' said Eric George, one of the participants. ``It's a touching
moment. The feeling that they've got your money and there's nothing
you can do about it.''
   In some cities, protesters used the day to demonstrate against
the use of income tax money for military purposes.
   Members of the Northern California War Tax Resistance, based in
Berkeley, distributed $6,000 to various charities, saying the money
came from people who refuse to pay all or part of their federal
taxes because the money is used for ``war and war preparations.''
   Actually, not everyone had to have their returns in the mail by
midnight Monday.
   Residents of Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut,
upstate New York and Massachusetts got an extra day this year
because Monday was a holiday, Patriots' Day, in Massachusetts.
Residents of those states mail their returns to the Internal
Revenue Service office at Andover, Mass.
   But for the rest of the country, April 17 was the deadline
because April 15 fell on the weekend.
   Brooks Drake, a district manager who oversees 18 H&amp;R Block Inc.
offices in Dayton, Ohio, said that when he assured worried clients
that they had not missed the filing deadline, ``it was like people
on death row finding out they had gotten a reprieve.''
   Whatever the deadline, IRS Form 4868 _ request for a filing
extension _ is the most-requested form this late in the season,
said Roslyn Russell of the IRS office in South Bend, Ind.
   Officials of the IRS center at Fresno, Calif., said they
expected to receive the majority of the 11.4 million returns from
central and southern California and Hawaii regions by Wednesday. As
of last week, the center had received 5.9 million returns.
   But the deluge of work doesn't mean IRS workers don't have time
for an occasional smile.
   In the IRS Arkansas offices, laughs have sprung from requests
for Form 911, which is reserved for taxpayers who cite unusual
circumstances in requesting a speedy refund or relief from paying
taxes, said IRS spokesman Ken Hubenak in Little Rock.
   ``One person in particular was trying to get us to speed up the
refund check because he had pawned his tools, and wanted us to call
the pawnbroker and explain it to him,'' Hubenak said. ``Another
asked that they call a grocery store and say the check was on the
way.''

   Exxon will hire 4,000 people to scrub at
least 305 miles of shoreline fouled by America's worst oil spill,
and says the job can be finished by the third week in August,
according to a plan released Monday.
   The cleanup can be be completed by August if a hot-water
cleaning method that can damge beach life is used aggressively, or
by mid-September if environmentally safer methods play a larger
role, the draft plan says.
   Those projections were disputed by a state ecologist, who said
after reviewing the plan that only about 150 miles could be cleaned
before winter. And the top state environmental official called for
the plan to be broadened to include areas where the oil has spread
outside Prince William Sound.
   ``It's a start,'' said Department of Environmental Conservation
chief Dennis Kelso. ``It needs more work.''
   The plan estimates that by June 1 the company will have 2,500
Alaskans working on the shoreline, with 1,500 other people in
support roles. It says 11 barges, 28 landing vessels, 150 utility
ships, and six wash-vacuum ships will be used.
   According to the plan, the total shoreline in Prince William
Sound affected by the March 24 Exxon Valdez wreck is 366 miles _
about the distance from New York City to Norfolk, Va., or Los
Angeles to Phoenix, Ariz.
   Concentration of oil on the beach runs from 1,260 gallons to
12,600 gallons per mile, with an average of 4,200 gallons per mile,
the oil company said. The plan said Exxon so far has recovered
924,000 gallons, or 9 percent, of the spilled oil.
   The plan proposes to clean up 305 miles. It estimates that 54
miles are heavily oiled, 86 moderately oiled and 165 lightly oiled.
It assumes that needed permits will be promptly issued and that no
additional oil will wash ashore.
   But Steve Haavig of the Department of Environmental Conservation
estimated after reviewing the plan that crews would be able to
scrape and spray greasy black sludge from only about one mile of
beach per day.
   ``A mile a day is optimistic,'' Haavig said.
   At most, there are 150 days from the time workers and gear are
mobilized, two or three weeks from now, until winter descends in
September.
   Haavig said crews might make good time on lightly oiled beaches,
but the more heavily polluted stretches will slow them.
   Asked for comment, Exxon spokesman Dennis Stanczuk said the
company wanted to confer first with the Coast Guard commandant,
Adm. Paul Yost, who was sent by President Bush to hasten the
cleanup.
   Kelso, in a letter to Yost, demanded that Exxon improve its
cleanup of oil still in the water.
   He said the company should come up with a plan by April 25 to
clean beaches beyond Prince William Sound in the Gulf of Alaska,
where the oil has spread. He said he also wants data on how to
manage and dispose of wastes.
   Meanwhile, wildlife officials brought grim reports from the Nuka
Island and Nuka Bay area on the Kenai Peninsula, about 175 miles
southwest of where the Exxon Valdez smashed into Bligh Reef.
   ``They found a lot of dead birds and a lot of live, oiled
birds,'' Glenn Seaman of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game
said in Homer. ``There's otter tracks on every beach.''
   Part of the herring grounds at the north end of the Kodiak
Islands remained closed Monday because of oil sightings. It was
feared the more important herring fishery at Kamishak Bay might not
be able to begin as scheduled later this week.
   Prince William Sound lies south of Valdez, the seaport where the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline ends. Until the spill, its waters and
islands had been among the most scenic in the nation, and few
places in the world are richer in wildlife and fish.
   Yost spent part of Sunday at Block Island in the sound, where
muck was puddled ankle-deep in places. Exxon had assembled state
and federal officials and reporters for a demonstration of cleanup
methods, including an environmentally risky steam-cleaning
technique that sterilizes the shore.
   Haavig also was on Block Island, checking the depth of the beach
contamination. In some places, the oil had soaked in only an inch.
In others, it was found several inches deep. ``They're never going
to get it all,'' he said.
   In Portland, Ore., meanwhile, state environmental chief Fred
Hansen said the crippled Exxon Valdez appeared sound enough to make
it to the Port of Portland for evaluation. He said he expected
Exxon to agree to several conditions before officials allow the
tanker to travel up the Columbia River.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Stocks Off</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with Morning Nikkei, comments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. dollar traded higher against the Japanese
yen at midday Tuesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange posted a moderate loss.
   The dollar, which opened at 132.23 yen, up 0.40 yen from
Monday's 131.83-yen finish, was quoted at 132.20 yen at midday. The
currency moved in a narrow range of 132.10-132.27 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
157.89 points to close at a record-high 33,308.33 Monday, ended the
morning session at 33,254.49, down 53.84 points or 0.16 percent.
   The index rose marginally in early morning trading but began
falling as investors sold for profit taking, said Tsuneo Ishii with
Nomura Securities.
   ``That's mainly because participants were concerned about the
U.S. consumer price index report to be released later tonight and
avoided buying,'' he said.
   Later Tuesday, Washington was to announce the March U.S.
consumer price index, which measures changes in the retail prices
of a constant market basket of goods and services.
   Investors also were discouraged by concerns over the Recruit
bribery scandal, dealers said. Prosecutors are expected to make
more arrests this week in connection with the affair.
   So far, prosecutors have arrested 14 people in connection with
stock profiteering and suspected bribery linked to a major
information services firm, Recruit Co.
   In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate was moving little as
market players avoided making major moves ahead of the U.S. CPI
announcement, traders said.
