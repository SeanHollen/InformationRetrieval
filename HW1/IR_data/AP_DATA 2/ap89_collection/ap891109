   On the hurricane-battered
island of Vieques, a practice site for U.S. Navy bombing off Puerto
Rico, residents link their destiny to a century-old tamarind tree
on a barren hill.
   ``If the tree survives, so will Vieques,'' said engineer Sixto
Perez after a ceremony to replant the tree, which was uprooted by
Hurricane Hugo on Sept. 18.
   ``It has been silent witness to our history,'' Nana Ortiz de
Castano, a retired teacher, told schoolchildren gathered around the
tree.
   The U.S. Navy has been part of Vieques' history since World War
II.
   It owns two-thirds of the island and uses it for practice
bombings and maneuvers. In the 1970s, Vieques was rocked by violent
anti-Navy protests. Similar demonstrations in 1975 drove the Navy
off its sister island, Culebra. Although the Navy says relations
have improved in recent years, many Viequenses, as the 8,000
residents are called, say Hurricane Hugo has made matters worse.
Vieques was one of the areas hardest hit by the storm.
   Hugo pounded Vieques for 12 hours with winds clocked at 140 to
200 mph, demolishing or damaging virtually all its 3,000 homes.
Trees were either knocked downed or defoliated, leaving the
once-verdant, sun-splashed island with little shade.
   ``It will take 10 years to recover,'' said Luiz Davila, manager
of a General Electric plant that makes electric switches and is the
island's largest employer, with 132 workers.
   ``Now we are seeing the devastation,'' Davila added. ``In six
months, a year, we will see the lack of income people will have.''
   With their homes and possessions gone and their future
livelihood in doubt, some residents despair. Officials say two
people hanged themselves and several others attempted suicide after
the storm. No one in Vieques died in the hurricane itself.
   ``There is lot of depression, a lot of suicide attempts,'' said
Dr. Eva Almodovar, who is in charge of the emergency room at the
Vieques Hospital. ``It's people who have lost everything. ... They
don't see a way out.''
   The Navy is helping rebuild roads and restore power and water.
   The day after the hurricane, the Navy put up a roadblock to
prevent squatters from returning to a disputed area where they had
set up shacks and burned two Navy vehicles in April.
   Robert Ravin, a high school history teacher, charged that the
Navy acted ``like thieves in the night,'' taking advantage of the
hurricane crisis.
   But a Navy spokesman, Lt. Richard Boyle, said the roadblock was
put up because the squatters were ``unauthorized people on Navy
property. The shacks had been blown down and were completely
demolished.''
   The Navy bought Vieques land for training during World War II,
resettling residents in the center of the island, which is 20 miles
long and six miles across. Most of the Navy property is unused and
hundreds of squatters have moved in over the past year.
   Rear Adm. John A. Moriarty, commander of Caribbean naval forces,
said relations with Vieques residents have been ``very, very good.''
   But squatter organizer Antonio Figueroa, a carpenter who says
his movement is ``rescuing land,'' believes the Navy ``has a master
plan'' to stifle development to keep the island to itself.
   Many Viequenses complain that the Navy's presence has kept the
island underdeveloped, underpopulated and poverty-stricken.
   Vieques has a severe housing shortage, an unemployment rate of
70 percent, and an annual per capita income of $5,281, as opposed
to the Puerto Rico average of $8,721. The majority of the islanders
are on welfare.
   Although its unspoiled beauty has made it the location for
several movies, most recently ``Heartbreak Ridge,'' with Clint
Eastwood about the 1983 U.S.-led invasion of Grenada, Vieques has
seen little tourism.
   ``The Navy occupies two-thirds of the island and this prevents
it from developing to its plenitude because they own the best
beaches, the best land,'' said Mayor Manuela Santiago Collazo.
   Vieques has been losing population for years, and is expected to
lose 2,000 of its 8,000 inhabitants by the year 2000.
   ``A young Viequense who becomes an engineer, a doctor or a
lawyer can't come back because there is nothing to do here,'' said
Figueroa.

<HEAD>Year Later Insurance Rates Still Not Slashed</HEAD>

   The first anniversary of California voters'
approval of Proposition 103 passed with citizens still waiting for
insurance rates to be slashed.
   Its author claims that while victory has been delayed, it has
not been denied.
   ``What's at stake here is democracy and who's in charge,'' the
initiative's author, Harvey Rosenfield, told a press conference
Wednesday at the headquarters of the Voter Revolt organization.
   The proposition, which has the force of law, called for 20
percent rollbacks from 1987 auto insurance rates. It also said that
geography should be less important to setting rates than drivers'
records and experience and made the office of insurance
commissioner an elected position.
   The major insurance companies, however, have not rolled back
their rates in the wake of a court battle over the referendum. An
estimated 700 companies were affected. They also have not begun
judging rates according to driving records.
   The insurance commissioner, at least, becomes an elected
position in the November 1990 election.
   On the anniversary day, Rosenfield and Conway Collis, an elected
state tax official who also is a candidate for the 1990 race for
insurance commissioner, stood behind boxes marked ``$1,000s''
symbolizing the 20 percent rollbacks still in insurers' coffers.
   They said Prop. 103's promises would soon be realized if
supporters keep faith. ``It's fair to say that for the first time
we can see light at the end of the tunnel,'' Rosenfield said.
   But they acknowledged frustration, and Rosenfield fired salvos
at state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie.
   ``We are as frustrated as anybody else is,'' Rosenfield said.
``It is an absolute outrage that we are basically 11 months behind
schedule in the provisions of 103 that were supposed to go into
effect on election day.''
   Voters approved Prop. 103 on Nov. 8, 1988, on a vote of 4.8
million to 4.6 million. The next day insurers filed numerous
lawsuits against it and a day later the California Supreme Court
suspended implementation for a review.
   By December, the Supreme Court had lifted the stay on
implementing most of the measure except for the 20-percent
rollbacks.
   To add insult to injury, the largest seller of auto insurance in
California, State Farm, announced in January that it was raising
rates an average of 9.6 percent.
   Prop. 103 was upheld by the high court in May, but the court
said the commissioner should exempt a company from rollbacks if it
would not receive what the court called a fair and reasonable rate
of return.
   In early August the commissioner set the fair rate of return at
11.2 percent annually. By the end of August that figure had been
characterized as tentative and could be revised upward.
   In the meantime, more than 400 insurance companies had filed for
exemption from rollbacks and the commissioner said three of the
state's largest insurance sellers were among hundreds likely to win
exemptions.
   During summer hearings, insurance companies also told Gillespie
she should continue to allow territorial rating systems in which
prices are set according to neighborhood.
   As more rate hikes were announced and confusion over the status
of Prop. 103 mounted, Gillespie on Oct. 2 ordered rate increases
frozen for six months and said all issues would be taken up at
hearings.
   Collis sought to put the best face on the developments.
   ``It's really important for people to realize on this
anniversary of 103 that rollbacks have been delayed, the move away
from territorial rating system has been delayed but it's now in the
process and if we hang together awhile longer it's now going to
happen,'' Collis said.
   The insurance companies want people to become apathetic about
Prop. 103, Rosenfield claimed.
   ``If you talk to the insurance companies they gloat about the
fact that 71 percent of the people have said they don't ever think
that they ever have forced the insurance companies to give us those
rollbacks,'' he said.
   Asked if he would have done anything differently, Rosenfield
said he should have incorporated criminal penalties into the law.

   ``Life is a thief,'' Katharine Hepburn tells
Montgomery Clift in ``Suddenly, Last Summer.'' But life knew better
than to steal from Kate the Great.
   The voice Tallulah Bankhead once likened to ``nickels dropping
in a slot machine'' has grown tremulous with age. But nothing can
daunt that special Yankee strength that has seen 80 autumns.
Hepburn remains arrogant, bossy and tenacious, principled,
passionate and clever. Her viperish wit slices and dices. No, don't
mess with Kate.
   ``I think I'm very irritating to some people,'' she once said.
``It fascinates me, though, because I'm so sweet really.''
   Hepburn celebrated her 80th birthday Wednesday not quietly at
home as some her age would have it, but dashing about New York,
visiting ill friends. ``She's being a good Samaritan,'' her
secretary, Sharon Powers, said.
   ``Who cares about my birthday?'' the actress said recently. ``I
don't, as long as I can get around and think straight.''
   And she does think, about many things. She frets about the
backyard garden of her Manhattan brownstone, rails at youthful sex,
supports abortion and champions euthanasia for the elderly. If it
exists, Hepburn has something to say about it.
   ``I think there's sort of a terrible fear of death in this
country, and I just don't think you should fear something that is
absolutely inevitable,'' she said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   ``I've been extremely lucky. I've got money and I can decide to
work or not work. I've been terribly lucky all my life.''
   Hepburn had a scare when a growth was discovered last year on
her vocal cords. A biopsy showed it was not cancerous, and she
recovered nicely from surgery.
   From the day RKO studio bosses first spotted her on the New York
stage in an abbreviated tunic playing an Amazon queen in ``The
Warrior's Husband,'' Hepburn has enchanted and seduced a moviegoing
public.
   Her first movie, ``A Bill of Divorcement,'' with John Barrymore,
was a success. Her next was a dud. The third, the stagey 1933
production ``Morning Glory,'' won her first Academy Award; three
others came in 1967, 1968 and 1981 for ``Guess Who's Coming to
Dinner,'' ``The Lion in Winter'' and ``On Golden Pond.''
   But after ``Morning Glory,'' Hepburn made several flops that
turned her into box-office poison. ``The Philadelphia Story'' in
1940 marked her resurrection from Hollywood's graveyard with her
champagney portrayal of a spoiled rich girl who marries and
remarries the man she loves.
   Playwright Philip Barry wrote it for her and the play was a
smash on Broadway.
   ``I bought the movie rights. They wanted to buy it for all my
rivals, but I already owned it. Very clever,'' she said.
   ``Then I stayed at Metro (MGM) and did all those pictures with
Spencer. I've done things for the honest reason that I like them.
You can't do things just to be successful. You have to do things
that affect you.''
   Spencer was Spencer Tracy, Hepburn's closest friend for 27
years. She was linked romantically with billionaire industrialist
Howard Hughes and producer Leland Hayward, and was married once _
in 1928 to Philadelphia socialite Ludlow Ogden Smith. They divorced
in 1934.
   Hepburn inherited her Yankee tenacity from her parents. Her
father, Dr. Norval Hepburn, was a urologist who campaigned for
public awareness about venereal disease. Her mother, Katharine
Houghton, was a suffragist and a crusader in the birth control
movement.
   Their tenacity, she said, freed her from fear. ``I wasn't afraid
to pay the price of saying what I thought. I wasn't cautious.''
   At Bryn Mawr College with its high academic standards and
mannered students, she survived on her wits. She almost flunked out
but buckled down to work so she could act in school plays. After
graduating, she plunged into stock and finally landed a bit role in
a Broadway flop.
   Lately, she's done some television work, including last year's
``Laura Lansing Slept Here.'' But mostly, she putters about in her
garden, visits friends, spends time in her home on the Connecticut
shore and looks for the right movie projects.
   ``It's terribly difficult to find interesting roles,'' she once
said. ``And a poor old thing dying in a rest home is not a terribly
interesting picture. I think it's just depressing.''

   Tornadoes and torrential rains hit Georgia and Alabama on
Wednesday, killing a 3-year-old boy, damaging dozens of buildings
and tossing a mobile home with a woman inside into a fish pond. She
suffered slight injuries.
   In Pineview, Ga., three houses and at least two mobile homes
were damaged when the tornado hit about 5:45 p.m., Wilcox Deputy
Sheriff Stacy Johnson said.
   One of the mobile homes, the home of the 3-year-old, was
demolished, Johnson said. Five other people were injured, including
the child's father, Billy West.
   West suffered an apparent broken neck and was undergoing tests
at the Medical Center of Central Georgia in Macon. Johnson did not
know the child's name.
   In Louisiana, New Orleans-area residents cleaned up flooded
homes as rain kept falling in the southeastern part of the state.
   The National Weather Service said the latest storm was not
expected to cause floods like Tuesday's, when hundreds of homes
were swamped and a 2-year-old boy drowned after being swept into a
drainage canal in Jefferson Parish.
   Wednesday's rain knocked out power to about 600 New Orleans
homes and businesses, far fewer than the 11,000 affected the
previous day, said Bill Tregre of Entergy Corp.
   In Alabama, the morning twisters caused damage only in Geneva
County and a mile-long stretch Dothan in the state's southeast
corner, but streets were flooded from Mobile in the west and much
of southern Alabama, officials said. No other injuries were
reported.
   Two or three tornadoes destroyed three homes and a restaurant,
damaged six businesses and did minor damage to about 40 homes in
the Dothan area, Dothan-Houston County Emergency Management Agency
officials said. The restaurant's roof and walls blew across the
street into a tire store's parking lot, damaging dozens of cars.
   ``We've found some roofs that were taken seven blocks away and
dropped,'' said emergency agency Assistant Director Pat Bradley.
   At Wallace College in Dothan, about 2,000 panicky students were
ordered to remain inside a building for more than an hour as flood
waters inundated the campus because tornado warnings were in
effect, said school spokeswoman Barbara Alford.
   ``We had some cars floating in the parking lot,'' said Anne
Powell, secretary to the president at the school. Classes were
called off for the day.
   Houston County public schools were also closed.
   In Geneva County about 40 miles southwest of Dothan, a tornado
tossed Mrs. E.C. Barnes' mobile home into a pond with her inside,
said a Samson police dispatcher who refused to give his name.
   ``They had to go out in a boat to get her,'' the dispatcher
said. Mrs. Barnes, 54, suffered cuts and was hospitalized for
observation, he said.
   In Malvern about 10 miles southwest of Dothan, thunderstorm
winds damaged a house trailer and peanut wagons.
   Nearly 10 inches of rain fell in Florala, 7 inches in Dothan and
5.6 inches in Mobile by mid-afternoon, the weather service said.
   The New Orleans area received up to 1.75 inches of rain by noon,
far less than Tuesday. Between 6 p.m. Monday and 3 p.m. Tuesday, a
deluge of 12.5 inches fell at New Orleans International Airport in
Kenner, the weather service said.
   By Wednesday, flood waters had receded nearly everywhere, except
for a 1,000-house subdivision in Destrehan nearly 15 miles west of
New Orleans.
   Officials did not know how many buildings in New Orleans and the
surrounding St. Charles, Jefferson, and St. Bernard parishes were
flooded or how much damage was done.
   ``It happened so quick and it caught everybody off-guard. We
haven't calculated any hard figures,'' said Capt. Sam Zinna of the
St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Office.
   Public and Catholic schools were closed Wednesday in Jefferson
and St. Charles parishes. Public schools were open in New Orleans
and St. Bernard Parish, but Catholic schools were closed.
   Some residents were able to get back to their homes and start
cleaning up.
   ``I'm still here mopping up water,'' said Alberta Lewis of
Kenner, who said she had about 2 feet of water in the house Tuesday.

   An exceptional harvest in vineyards across France
has wine growers and wine lovers happily anticipating their first
tastings of this year's vintage.
   There's even talk, perhaps overexcited, that 1989 could produce
some of the best wines of the century.
   The enthusiasm stems from near-perfect growing conditions: a
hot, dry summer that meant drought for other farmers, followed by
an early harvest free from rain.
   ``We've got sun in the vats,'' said Maurice Vigier, a producer
of Chateau Reve d'Or, a Bordeaux Pomerol, and winner of the
Concours Agricole wine competition. ``The quality is very high.''
   Hopes are high from Alsace in the northeast to Bordeaux in the
southwest, and in all the winegrowing regions in between.
   ``It's a good year all over France,'' said Christian Amare,
spokesman for the Maison de la Vigne et du Vin. Besides the high
quality, production is up in quantity by 5 percent over last year,
he said.
   Olivier le Flaive, a grower of Puligny-Montrachet and a wine
dealer for the Cote d'Or, said the 1989 Burgundy whites will be the
best in a decade.
   ``They are of very, very good quality, at least equal to the
good wines of 1978, the acidity is minimal but acceptable. I'd
grade the whites 19 out of a perfect 20,'' he said, adding that the
region also will have some exceptional red wines.
   But there are reservations as well among wine experts and
producers, many of whom are withholding praise until the first
corks are popped.
   ``It may be the year of the decade, because growers and the
media want it to be,'' said Steven Spurrier, the founder of
l'Academie du Vin in Paris and one of the best-known wine
connoisseurs in the city.
   Spurrier said he would wait to see if overripe grapes produce
``a flabby, over-rich product.''
   Tim Johnston, co-owner of Willi's Wine Bar and Juveniles in
Paris, said: ``It was a great year, but people who are hyping the
harvest haven't understood the problems of drought. Some of the
whites, for example, are lacking freshness and acidity.''
   Russell Hone of Le Serbet, a wine brokerage firm in Burgundy,
said the white wines from his region have finesse ``with good
intensity of taste.''
   ``But these wines may not be as rich and lush as 1986, nor as
alcoholic as 1985. For now, the white Burgundies still have a milky
quality like grapefruit juice,'' Hone said. ``It's a good year, but
too early to say if it's great.''
   Hone said Burgundy suffered hailstorms and frost in June and
that ``quality varied according to vineyards up and down the Cote
d'Or.''
   There will be plenty of vintage Champagne as producers there
bubble with enthusiasm for a crop that produced 10 percent more
wine than usual.
   ``We've had an exceptional year,'' said Philippe Coulon,
director of oenology at Moet et Chandon. ``The condition of the
grapes was perfect; they reached the ideal maturity, were perfectly
healthy, giving a balanced product.
   ``For the final verdict, we have to await February and March,
but we're predicting a `millesime' or vintage year,'' Coulon said.
   The year's wines may be memorable for their abundance and
flavor, but they also will be remembered for being more expensive
than ever before. Champaign prices are fixed at 13 percent higher
than last year.
   Some blame rising labor costs or the expense of improved
vinification. Often it simply is a question of supply not meeting
demand.
   And sometimes public relations campaigns have as much influence
as producers in how a wine is priced. Wines from regions that are
``hyped'' bring as much as the market will bear.
   ``A lot of speculators in Bordeaux buy it up even before the
secondary fermentation is finished,'' said Mark Williamson of
Willi's Wine Bar, adding that it is too early to judge the 1989
Bordeaux.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``Thanks to this year's hype, the price
will probably rise.''

   Here is a chronology of retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard Secord's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair:
   1983: Secord leaves the government under a cloud concerning his
ties to Edwin P. Wilson, a former CIA agent convicted in 1983 of
illegally shipping munitions to Libya and plotting to kill an
opponent of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   1984: Secord, an expert in handling covert operations, begins
selling arms to the Contras at the request of White House aide
Oliver North. North says he got Secord's name from CIA Director
William Casey about the time U.S. aid to the Contras was running
out and Congress was barring the intelligence agency from supplying
the rebels with military aid.
   Late 1985: North brings Secord into the Reagan administration's
secret arms initiative with Iran.
   October-November 1986: One of the North network's planes is shot
down over Nicaragua and the administration's arms sales to Iran are
exposed. Also uncovered is the diversion of Iran arms sale money to
the Contras through the complex of secret accounts operated by
Secord and his business partner Albert Hakim.
   May 1987: Secord is the first witness in the congressional
Iran-Contra hearings. In four days of testimony, he says that:
   _He assumed President Reagan knew of his activities.
   _He forswore profits in the Iran-Contra operation, never getting
any money besides his $6,000-a-month salary.
   March 16, 1988: Secord, North, Hakim and former National
Security Adviser John Poindexter are indicted following a criminal
investigation by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. A federal
judge ultimately decides the defendants must be tried separately,
and North later is convicted on three counts.
   Nov. 8, 1989: Secord pleads guilty to a single felony,
concerning lying to Congress about financial help he gave North,
five days before his trial is to begin on 12 criminal charges.

   The frames were soldered to the 9-foot statue's nose and ears.
   Sculptor Tony Lopez said he has a way to foil any similar thefts
on his likeness of the venerable Miami Democrat, who died in May.

<DATELINE>ANDAJES, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although high in the Andes and far from
anything else, this village of communal farmers has not escaped a
Maoist guerrillas' terror campaign to disrupt nationwide municipal
elections Sunday _ and in the long run the presidential election
next year.
   A column of 30 guerrillas of the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path)
movement entered Andajes one stormy night and seized Mayor Heraclio
Segundo, four other local officials and a sixth man they accused of
cattle rustling. They then dragged them into the village plaza,
where they killed them with single gunshots to the back of the neck.
   As a result, no candidates are running for office Sunday in
Andajes.
   ``All that people think about is that they will come back, that
there will be more killings,'' said Andres Zuniga Bernabe, a young
farmer.
   The wave of assassinations of mayors and other local officials
in Peru has reached levels unprecedented in the Shining Path's
9-year-old insurgency.
   Latest available figures show that 263 mayors' posts around Peru
are unfilled, nearly all of them in small towns and villages with
little or no police protection.
   In Junin department, in the country's mining and farming
heartland 150 miles east of Lima, only 61 of 122 municipalities
have mayors.
   Some 4,500 candidates registered to run in the nation's nearly
2,000 mayoralty races, but an estimated 400 have resigned in fear,
and government officials expect many more to withdraw before
election day.
   So far this year the rebels have slain 45 mayors. They also have
killed 73 local judges, clerks, councilmen and municipal candidates.
   In October, 22 local authorities were slain. A total of 330
people died in armed clashes and political violence, one of the
highest monthly tolls since the Shining Path launched its
insurgency to topple Peru's elected government.
   Shining Path seeks to install a workers' and peasants' state
patterned on the ideas of the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung of China.
   Political analysts and counterinsurgency experts agree that the
rebels' campaign to disrupt the municipal elections is only the
first stage of their strategy to block the presidential election in
April and provoke a military coup.
   Shining Path's strategy then most likely would be to place
itself in the vanguard of a popular front against a military
dictatorship.
   Publicly, the populist government of President Alan Garcia has
guaranteed that municipal elections will take place throughout Peru.
   But privately a close Garcia aide, speaking in Lima on condition
he not be identified, said, ``The truth is we are not in a position
to guarantee the normal course of elections. I wonder how many
people are going to be able to vote.''
   He said Peru would need 300,000 policemen, not the 75,000 it
has, to provide around-the-clock protection to current authorities
and all municipal candidates.
   National election board officials are focusing their efforts on
guaranteeing that voting takes place in a normal fashion in Lima
and other major cities, where most of Peru's population of 21
million is concentrated.
   A third of the national territory is under states of emergency
that suspend constitutional guarantees and give the military broad
powers to fight guerrillas.
   It is in those areas that the elections are most in doubt, but
many critics of government policy say the contested regions cannot
be written off if Peru is going to defend its democratic system.
   Here in Andajes, situated on the dome of an 11,000-foot
mountain, people feel the government has knowingly let them pass
into the Shining Path's domain.
   Andajes is only 90 miles north of Lima in a straight line, but a
six-hour ride over bumpy roads that rise from the mist-shrouded
desert coast and climb the empty western slopes of the Andes.
   With its 2,000 inhabitants, its narrow cobblestone lanes and its
mud-brick houses, Andajes never received much attention in Lima.
But now the villagers feel totally abandoned.
   ``The people live with the fear that Sendero will return,'' said
village elder Ruben Torres.
   The 16-man police detachment sent to Andajes after its officials
were killed withdrew in June to the town of Churin, an hour's drive
away at the foot of the mountain.
   ``Most people did not sleep that first night,'' said Nancy
Jiron, a government health worker assigned to Andajes. ``They
gathered in small groups and waited for daybreak. They began to
realize they would have to accept being alone again.''

   An accident at a government-owned
nuclear production plant triggered a release of radioactive
hydrogen Wednesday, contaminating four workers and sending the gas
into the atmosphere.
   Richard Neff, manager of environmental health and safety at the
Mound Nuclear Production Plant, called the release of tritium minor
but said it was the largest such release at the southwestern Ohio
plant since the 1960s.
   He said it was 10 times what is normally released at the plant
each year.
   ``It's a relatively small release,'' Neff said at a news
conference. ``We don't believe we had a significant amount that
went up.''
   The tritium was vented into an exhaust stack and released into
the air, taking a projected northwesterly path. Miamisburg is about
10 miles southwest of Dayton.
   Plant officials initially estimated that in the worst-case
scenario, a few dozen residents may have been exposed to 12
millirems of tritium, the equivalent of one chest X-ray.
   However, plant spokesman Howard Charbeneau later said an
investigation revealed that the maximum off-site dosage was 0.051
millirems. He said a person flying in a plane across the country
would be exposed to 3 millirems.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's standard of safe
dosage is 25 millirems a year.
   The plant produces detonators for nuclear weapons and propulsion
systems for spacecraft.
   The accident occurred when a quartz window in a bell jar
containing tritium shattered. Workers were evacuated from the
building.
   Harold Anderson, manager of tritium technology and surveillance,
said 52 workers were in the area when the accident occurred. He
said six of them had contamination on their clothing.
   Of those six, four were found to have tritium in their system.
   Neff said half the tritium will pass through a person's body in
12 days.
   ``It's relatively low-risk, compared to most radioactive
material,'' he said.
   About 2,200 workers are employed at the plant, operated by EG&amp;G
Mound Applied Technologies for the U.S. Department of Energy.

<TEXT>
   Dorf, a loveable buffoon played by comedian
Tim Conway, has played golf, witnessed the first Olympic Games, and
gone auto racing. Now, Dorf is going to court.
   A production company is suing Conway, who plays the 4-foot-tall
Derk Dorf character on videos, over the distribution of the tape
``Dorf Goes Auto Racing.''
   J2 Communications Inc., which claims to have the distribution
rights, alleges in a Superior Court lawsuit filed Wednesday that
Conway wrongly intends to sell ``Dorf Goes Auto Racing'' through
another company.
   J2 Communications seeks unspecified damages on allegations
including breach of contract, breach of good faith and fraud.
   The Dorf character was introduced in a J2-produced and
distributed video called ``Dorf on Golf,'' starring Conway's
diminutive alter-ego accompanied by a statuesque female assistant
named ``Boom Boom.''
   The video has sold more than 200,000 copies, making it one of
the seven most popular videos of all time, the lawsuit says.
   Other Dorf videos include ``Dorf and the First Games of Mt.
Olympus'' and ``Dorf's Golf Bible.''
   Conway's telephone number was not listed, so the entertainer
could not immediately be reached for comment.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hay tainted with parts of rabbits caught in
harvesting machinery caused the deaths of at least 15 horses in
Southern California, according to veterinarians.
   Veterinarians investigating the deaths say the rabbits may have
been caught in machinery at a farm in Utah, then shredded and
pressed into cubes of hay at a processing plant in suburban
Paramount.
   Toxin secreted by the parts produced a rare strain of botulism
known as Clostridium Botulinum, type C, Dr. Hailu Kinde of
California Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory Systems told a news
conference at the Orange County Fairgrounds.
   The strain, common in aquatic birds, mink, dogs and cats, last
affected horses 10 years ago in Florida, Kinde said.
   The laboratory at the University of California, Davis, made the
discovery this week while testing hay cubes that were part of a
batch consumed by the affected horses, he said.
   Seven horses died at the Orange County Fairgrounds equestrian
center, three at a Chino stable, two at the Los Angeles Equestrian
Center, and veterinarians reported three other cases. In at least
11 of the cases, the horses were fed cubes from Paramount Cubing,
investigators said.
   Nine of 260 horses boarded at stables in the Los Angeles County
fairgrounds in Pomona have displayed the symptoms since Oct. 28,
said trainer Larry Mayfield. Veterinarians in Alhambra and Ventura
County have reported similar illnesses.
   Darrell Hofmeyer, owner of Paramount Cubing, said the company
had been told by its attorney not to discuss the matter right away.
   Feed stores said the sale of hay cubes has fallen sharply in
recent days as word about the possibility of the cubes being
tainted spread.
   ``I haven't sold any cubes or pellets in several days,'' said
Regina Culbertson of the Feed Barn in Costa Mesa. ``I really got a
run of (baled) alfalfa on Saturday. Everything is gone.''
   Symptoms include quivering legs, low temperature and dull eyes.
The animals collapse from weakness and breathing difficulties and
usually die or must be destroyed within days.

<TEXT>
   Tumbleweeds tossed by 50-mph winds buried
houses in this Missouri River town, and residents struggled to dig
out of the prickly problem.
   The mayor warned residents who had tumbleweeds up to their
chimneys to clear them to reduce the danger of fire.
   The weeds had grown thick all summer along the banks of the
drought-shrunken Oahe Reservoir in north-central South Dakota.
Winds out of the west Tuesday evening sent the weeds rolling across
the prairie.
   ``People in the west end of town as they were sitting in their
homes ... heard what sounded like rocks being thrown against their
houses,'' Larry Atkinson, publisher of The Mobridge Tribune, said
Wednesday.
   ``They came out this morning to find out that a number of houses
were buried, literally buried, with tumbleweeds. We had some homes
with only the roof sticking out.
   ``We had people that could not get out of their driveways,''
Atkinson said. ``We had streets that were blocked, literally
invaded by tumbleweeds.''
   Mayor Darrell Bender urged residents to help clean up the mess.
City crews cleared the brush from the streets so vehicles could
pass. The cleanup was continuing today.
   ``It's developing into what could be a very dangerous
situation,'' Bender said. ``We need to use extreme caution. I'd
like to tell people not to drive through those tumbleweeds. Those
that have homes that are covered up to their chimneys, get those
weeds cleared so they don't start a fire.''
   Bender said he had asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which
manages the reservoir system, to help in the cleanup.
   ``I personally feel they have a responsibility for those
weeds,'' he said. ``They have done nothing to control the weeds.
They're 6 feet tall down there. We're going to have this problem
every time we have a west wind. I had advised them previously that
they had large weeds down there, and I was worried about what was
going to happen.''
   Phone calls by The Associated Press to the corps went unanswered
late Wednesday.
   Atkinson said removing the tumbleweeds will be difficult.
   ``Nobody knows for sure what to do with them,'' he said. ``You
can't crush them. All you can really do is move them around.''
   He said the corps planned to conduct a controlled burn to remove
some of the remaining weeds.
   ``It was the strangest thing I've ever seen,'' Atkinson said.
``We've been buried with snow before up in this area, but this is
the first time anybody can remember being buried with tumbleweeds.''

   L. Douglas Wilder's apparent victory in the Virginia governor's
race is a watershed in American political history, in which black
politicians have had but a shadowy presence.
   Wilder would be the nation's first elected black governor, but
would not be the first black American to serve as governor.
   That distinction belongs to Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback,
who became governor of Louisiana following the impeachment of Henry
Clay Warmoth in 1872. He served for 43 days until the newly elected
William Pitt Kellogg was sworn in.
   Although any number of candidates could have been drawn from the
small, black middle class that had existed in the nation since its
founding, a black was not elected to office until 1855, when John
Mercer Langston was elected clerk of Brownhelm Township in Lorain
County, Ohio.
   The first blacks ever elected to a legislative body were Edward
G. Walker, son of abolitionist David Walker, and Charles L.
Mitchell, who won seats in the Massachusetts House of
Representatives in 1866.
   Most of the nation's first black elected officials won their
positions during Reconstruction _ the post-Civil War period in
which Southern states were reorganized so they could rejoin the
Union. Blacks were allowed to vote for the first time and seek
elected office.
   It was a time when Robert H. Wood became mayor of Natchez,
Miss., and Joseph H. Rainey of South Carolina became the first
black in the House of Representatives.
   Hiram R. Revels, a minister, succeeded Jefferson Davis as U.S.
senator from Mississippi on Feb. 25, 1870, thus becoming first
black in Congress. But Blanche K. Bruce, also from Mississippi, was
the first black to serve a full term in the Senate.
   Pinchback, the son of a Mississippi planter and a black woman,
had been a captain in the Union Army. Following the Civil War, he
settled in Louisiana and joined the Republican Party, which largely
consisted of newly franchised blacks and sympathetic and liberal
whites.
   A shrewd and ambitious man, he was elected to the state Senate
in 1868 and was named president pro tempore. When Oscar J. Dunn, a
former slave and the nation's first black lieutenant governor,
died, Pinchback moved to the No. 2 spot through constitutional
succession.
   There were other black lieutenant governors during
Reconstruction in Mississippi and South Carolina. But none was ever
elected governor.
   Wilder, too, served as a lieutenant governor in a Southern
state. But in Virigina at the end of the 20th century, he is part
of the political mainstream.
   Pinchback was something of a pariah. Even as an elected
official, he and his family faced racism. His children had to be
escorted to high school to protect them from mobs of bigoted white
youths. And because of his elegance, intelligence and ambition,
white politicians considered him dangerous.
   His attempt to run for governor was thwarted because whites
controlled the election machinery and blacks were divided. He
instead ran for the U.S. House of Representatives and was elected.
He also ran for the U.S. Senate and was elected in 1873. But after
three years of debate, the Senate refused to seat him.
   ``I demand simple justice,'' Pinchback told the Senate. ``I do
not care so far as I am personally concerned whether you give me my
seat or not. I will go back to my people and come here again; but I
tell you to preserve your own consistency. Do not make fish of me
while you make flesh of everybody else.''
   Pinchback's case drew attention from the national press. Said
the New York Commercial Advertiser: ``Pinchback's presence in the
U.S. Senate is not open to the smallest objection, except the old
Bourbon war-whoops of color.
   ``Mr. Pinchback is the best dressed Southern man we have had in
Congress from the South since the days when gentlemen were
Democrats.''

<HEAD>Minimum Wage Increase Clears Congress; Bush to Sign</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only President Bush's promised signature is
needed for the first minimum wage increase in nearly a decade,
following Congress' lopsided approval of a bill raising the rate to
$4.25 by April 1991.
   The measure _ which includes a subminimum wage for teen-agers
new to the job market _ cleared the Senate on an 89-8 vote
Wednesday, exactly a week after it passed the House by an equally
overwhelming vote of 382-37.
   Bush, who struck the compromise plan with congressional
Democrats last week, is expected to sign the bill before
Thanksgiving, perhaps as early as next week.
   ``The nine-year logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken,''
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said after the Senate vote. ``The
working poor are about to receive an increase, although it is not
as much as they deserve.''
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, speaking for the Bush
administration, said ``the 3 million American workers currently on
the minimum wage will benefit.'' But she said skills training was
the best way to help the working poor and urged Congress to move
ahead with legislation dealing with that issue.
   ``The minimum wage is not the pulley to pull people out of
poverty,'' she said.
   The compromise plan will push the minimum wage, $3.35 an hour
since January 1981, to $3.80 on April 1 and to $4.25 a year later.
At the same time, it will create a new, lower wage for 16- to
19-year-old workers who are new to the job market.
   Democrats and organized labor long have opposed such a
subminimum ``training wage'' but were forced to concede that point
to Bush to strike the deal. In return, Bush agreed to have the
minimum wage reach $4.25 nine months earlier than he had proposed
and also accepted a far more restrictive training wage than he
sought earlier this year.
   Labor played down its concessions in calling on Bush to quickly
sign the measure into law.
   ``America's poorest workers have gone nearly a decade without a
raise and this long-overdue step will give them a chance to lift
themselves and their families out of poverty,'' AFL-CIO President
Lane Kirkland said.
   Even as they praised Bush for agreeing to the compromise,
Democrats said they would seek another increase heading into the
1992 presidential elections, when Bush likely will be seeking a
second term.
   Both sides made significant concessions to reach the compromise
four months after Bush vetoed an earlier Democratic minimum-wage
plan.
   In addition to agreeing to a subminimum, Democrats and labor
scaled back their final minimum-wage target; the measure Bush
vetoed called for an increase to $4.55 an hour.
   The White House, under increasing pressure from GOP lawmakers
seeking to avoid another veto battle heading into 1990 elections
year, agreed to a timetable reaching the $4.25 level nine months
before Bush had proposed.
   Bush also accepted a training wage that can only be paid to
workers 16 to 19 years old for their first three months of work
experience and for another three months if certified training is
provided. The provision allowing the subminimum expires in April
1993.
   Under the plan, the subminimum wage will be $3.35 on April 1 and
$3.61 a year later.
   Bush wanted to allow the lower wage to be paid to all workers,
regardless of age, for their first six months on any new job,
regardless of past work experience.
   All eight senators voting against the measure were Republicans.
They were Sens. William Armstrong of Colorado, Hatch and Jake Garn
of Utah, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire, Connie Mack of Florida, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, and
Steve Symms of Idaho. Three senators did not vote: Max Baucus,
D-Mont., Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.

<HEAD>Weak S&amp;Ls Should Find Merger Partner or Face Regulatory Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thrift regulator M. Danny Wall is issuing a
warning to weak savings and loan institutions: Find a merger
partner or face regulatory action.
   ``Thrifts that are undercapitalized are in very grave
jeopardy,'' Wall told the U.S. League of Savings Institutions on
Wednesday in closing its annual convention.
   His agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, estimates that 800
of the nation's 2,600 solvent S&amp;Ls will fall nearly $20 billion
short of new, more stringent capital standards taking effect Dec. 7.
   The agency believes 223 of the 800 are practically hopeless and
within a year will join 260 failed institutions already under
government control. Another segment of the 800 will meet the new
standard and stay independent by retaining earnings or selling
assets, Wall said.
   But, about 300 will stay out of the government's hands only by
seeking a private merger partner. Wall said his agency stands ready
to help by finding suitors, including foreign firms and commercial
banks, starting with a special conference next week.
   ``We are calling this our `arranged marriage' program,'' he said.
   The new rules require S&amp;L owners to back their lending with more
of their own capital and are designed to provide a larger buffer of
private money between S&amp;L losses and government deposit insurance
funds. They are considered the cornerstone reform in S&amp;L bailout
legislation enacted Aug. 9.
   Wall warned weak thrifts not to be too choosy about merger
offers, adding, ``We will not hesitate to take regulatory action.''
   ``Go with what you've got ... not with the would have and could
have'' or it will be too late to find a merger partner, he said.
   Under the bailout bill, thrifts not meeting capital standards by
the end of 1994 face closure and Wall's agency is writing rules
that would permit it to seize an undercapitalized thrift early,
before its owners' investment is exhausted.
   One S&amp;L executive, Robert Duncan, chairman of Magnolia Federal
Bank for Savings of Hattiesburg, Miss., said some of his colleagues
at weaker thrifts haven't yet admitted they can't survive alone.
   ``There are a great number of people out there who are unwilling
to face it. ... But it's going to be difficult to face the siren
call of merger with a commercial bank,'' he said.
   Wall cited recent interest by Canadian and Japanese companies as
evidence of the thrift industry's positive outlook.
   ``The worst is really over. We have been through the fire and
emerged tempered by the experience,'' he said.
   In his speech, Wall did not mention the controversy swirling
around his agency's handling of the failure of Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., expected to cost taxpayers up
to $2 billion.
   However, at a news conference, he defended his decision to delay
seizure of Lincoln by nearly two years, saying he was legally
required to keep it open unless it was insolvent. The staff of the
House Banking Committee disputes that assertion, maintaining that
Wall need only have determined that Lincoln was operating unsafely
and dissipating its assets.
   ``We were advised at the time we did not have the (legal) basis
(to seize Lincoln). It was the best advice we could find,'' he said.

   Outrage over the Exxon Valdez oil spill helped
lead to the House's vote to let the states continue setting
unlimited liability for oil spill cleanups, environmentalists say.
   But the oil industry says the measure approved Wednesday could
do more harm than good to the environment and raise consumer fuel
costs.
   ``It was clear that the Exxon Valdez was such a national insult
to the environment that all the lobbying by the oil companies and
special interests couldn't overcome it,'' said Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif.
   Mike Matz of the Sierra Club said the spill demonstrated ``there
were some serious deficiencies in the bill'' as it was originally
written.
   Miller and Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., successfully inserted an
amendment into a massive oil liability bill that allowed stricter
state laws, despite strong oil industry opposition and several
attempts on the House floor to soften the measure. The measure
would track current law which also allows states to set stricter
liability limits.
   The House was scheduled to vote on the entire bill today, but
the key vote was on the Miller-Studds amendment, which passed
279-143.
   ``We are dismayed and distressed that the House has taken this
gigantic step backward in environmental protection,'' said a
statement issued by the American Petroleum Institute after the vote.
   ``Unless altered by conference committee action, we must
strongly urge that the president veto this legislation,'' the
industry lobbying organization said.
   The group said that allowing states to go beyond federal limits
on the amount a company should spend for oil spill cleanup will
make insurance costs for hauling oil prohibitive.
   ``If the House's plan is adopted into law, many responsible
transporters of oil will likely be driven out of business and
replaced by less financially responsible and capable shippers,''
said the institute.
   ``Operators involved in transportation of petroleum products may
feel it's not worth the legal risks,'' Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y.,
said during debate on the amendment. ``Home heating oil may
suddenly disappear.''
   A $2 billion price tag has been put on the Exxon Valdez cleanup
in Alaska. That state sets no limits on companies' liability for
repairing environmental damage.
   The House bill would limit oil companies' liability to $1,200
per gross ton, with a minimum of $10 million for large tankers and
$2 million for small tankers. However, it would let states set
higher limits. The Senate has passed similar legislation.
   Twenty-eight states now have their own oil spill liability
statutes, and 19 of them require unlimited liability.
   Studds accused the oil industry of using scare tactics.
   ``Make no mistake,'' Studds said. ``When it comes to state
pre-emption and the oil industry, the battle lines are clearly
drawn between those who are hurt by oil spills and those who cause
them, between the public interest and a narrow private interest,
between the average citizen and big oil.''
   Environmentalists were surprised at the size of the vote in
their favor, especially on a second Miller amendment that makes an
oil company or carrier liable for unlimited damages in cases of
simple negligence, rather than gross negligence as the original
measure required. That amendment, which had been expected to be
defeated, passed 213 to 207.
   ``What it means is that the high-priced lobbyists that the oil
companies brought in don't always do the trick,'' said Joe Mehrkens
of the Wilderness Society.
   The House for 14 years has repeatedly passed bills against
allowing states to pre-empt the federal law.

<HEAD>Abortion Opponents Blame Own Candidates for `Waffling'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion opponents, acknowledging the issue
helped Democrats win this week's elections, blame their own
candidates for wavering in their anti-abortion positions _ but
defections already are beginning.
   ``The lesson that will be learned,'' said David O'Steen,
executive director of the National Right to Life Committee, ``is
that pro-life candidates cannot waffle and pro-life candidates must
run as aggressively on this issue as pro-abortion candidates.''
   An issue that once had Democrats on the run, abortion emerged as
a decisive factor in Democratic victories following a political
turnabout that Republicans couldn't foresee just a few months ago.
   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater conceded the issue
``made a difference'' in Tuesday's elections.
   ``I think the abortion issue helped me considerably,'' Democrat
L. Douglas Wilder said after claiming victory in his bid to become
governor of Virginia against anti-abortion Republican Marshall
Coleman.
   Sen. Robert Packwood of Oregon, a leader of the pro-choice
minority in the Republican Party, said the GOP faces losses next
year if it sticks to the anti-abortion position in its platform.
   ``I would hope that some of these elections yesterday might
bring us to our senses and we would understand that the public is
not on our side on this issue,'' he said after a meeting with
President Bush on the election results.
   Some Republicans already are signing up on the pro-choice side.
In Massachusetts, GOP gubernatorial candidate William Weld and a
number of GOP state legislators joined Democrats in signing a
petition Wednesday seeking a state constitutional amendment
guaranteeing the right to abortion.
   Weld predicted differences over abortion could decide the
primary race against his GOP rival, state House Minority Leader
Steven Pierce.
   O'Steen said Republican losers James Courter in the New Jersey
governor's race, and Rudolph Giuliani in the New York mayoral race,
sealed their defeats weeks ahead by giving ground in their
opposition to abortion.
   The National Right to Life Committee had abandoned both before
the election, he said.
   ``They flip-flopped because they were scared,'' said O'Steen.
   The anti-abortion group blamed Coleman's strategists for failing
to aggressively defend against Wilder's ads attacking him on the
abortion issue, and failing to forcefully push his anti-abortion
views in ads of his own.
   ``This is not a loss for the pro-life movement; it is a loss for
Marshall Coleman and the way he handled it,'' said Sandra Faucher,
director of the Right to Life group's political action committee.
   Coleman refused to concede after the unofficial final vote count
showed him trailing Wilder by about 5,500 votes out of the nearly
1.8 million cast.
   Abortion rights activists claimed partial credit for the
election of Democrat James Florio in New Jersey, and David Dinkins'
victory in New York.
   Both the New York and Virginia races also were caught up in the
potent and sometimes unspoken political crosscurrents of race.
Dinkins and Wilder are black and, while winning electoral
majorities, ran well behind what polling had indicated.
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said there was ``no question'' that Wilder
would not have won without the abortion issue.
   She said Courter's candidacy never got off the ground because of
his anti-abortion position, and that his attempts to soften his
opposition further hurt him.
   ``Voters yesterday proved that choice is a winning issue in
America,'' Michelman said. ``To politicians everywhere we say with
conviction: if you're out of touch with the pro-choice majority,
you're out of office.
   ``If George Bush and members of his party remain beholden to the
anti-choice minority, they will pay a tremendous price at the
polls,'' she said.
   Political analysts said the apparent turnaround on abortion was
the direct result of the Supreme Court's decision in July in the
Webster case. In it, the court gave states broader discretion in
regulating abortion and created the impression that major reversals
of abortion rights were possible.
   The court's action invigorated supporters of abortion rights and
created an opportunity for pro-choice candidates to exploit concern
about a retreat in abortion rights.

<HEAD>Six Executed For Rioting in Chengdu Following June 4 Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six people have been executed in the southwestern
city of Chengdu for participating in riots in June when the
government crushed the pro-democracy movement, a local official
said today.
   The executions brought to at least 18 the number of people put
to death following the military crackdown on demonstrators in
Beijing and other cities. Two people already had been reported
executed in Chengdu for roles in three days of rioting that began
June 4, when troops killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in Beijing
and police in Chengdu tried to break up a student sit-in.
   An estimated 30 people died in the Chengdu violence, and an
entire city block, including a large department store, was burned
down. It was the worst outbreak of violence in any city outside
Beijing.
   The six in Chengdu were sentenced to death at a public rally
Tuesday and immediately executed, said an official of Chengdu's
Foreign Affairs Office.
   Three were charged with ``beating, smashing, looting and
burning'' during the violence. The other three were charged with
theft and murder.
   At least 12 other people have been put to death for direct
involvement in anti-government demonstrations and riots throughout
China last spring.
   None of the previous 12 were students, and it was not clear
whether there were any students among the six executed in Chengdu
this week.
   China's press rarely reports arrests or court cases involving
the student-led pro-democracy movement. Reports that student
leaders and soldiers who refused to cooperate in the military
crackdown in Beijing have been executed cannot be confirmed.
   Executions in China are usually by a bullet to the back of the
head as the person sentenced kneels on the ground.

<HEAD>Ag Department Says More Rural Transportation Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shortline railroads, bus service, feeder
airlines and maybe a ferry or two could be possible under
long-range strategy mapped out in an Agriculture Department report
on rural transportation.
   But massive new federal aid to help finance such ventures? None
was mentioned in the report. Cooperation at all public and private
levels was urged as the key to transportation development.
   Martin F. ``Buzz'' Fitzpatrick Jr., head of the department's
Office of Transportation, which issued the report Wednesday, said
the findings and recommendations were based on regional meetings
going back two years and a national conference in Omaha, Neb., in
Aug. 1988.
   ``From the very beginning, this initiative has been a
cooperative activity involving a wide range of public and private
agencies seeking solutions to the transportation problems of rural
residents,'' he said.
   Fitzpatrick added the report will give rural transportation
organizations a practical guide to help in planning and policy
development at national, state and local levels.
   Although no specific mode was recommended over another, the
report referred to ``passenger transportation'' generically,
meaning it could include rail, bus or air travel, depending on the
circumstances.
   The report said cooperation between public and private sectors
``is essential if rural passenger transportation is to meet the
mobility needs of rural residents'' and that new approaches must be
found.
   In mobilizing support for rural passenger transportation, the
report said a national plan for rural communities to maintain and
expand passenger transportation should be a top priority for action.
   ``Communities are an essential source of financial and volunteer
support for rural passenger transportation providers,'' the report
said. ``Effective community participation can generate support for
continued intercity bus service and provide financial and volunteer
support for rural public providers.''
   The report said rural passenger needs are so diverse that a
single source of funding cannot be relied upon.
   ``Funding needs to be a joint federal, state and local
government effort in conjunction with private industry,'' it said.
``Utilizing a broad range of funding sources and allowing greater
flexibility in mixing available funding can provide more mobility
to more rural residents.''
   Copies of the report, ``Reconnecting Rural America:
Recommendations for a National Strategy,'' are available from:
USDA-OT, P.O. Box 96575, Washington, D.C. 20090-6575. For more

   Total U.S. vegetable output this year is up
from the drought-reduced 1988 production, an Agriculture Department
report said.
   The overall increase is due mostly to a 29 percent boost in
processing vegetable tonnage and a 3 percent larger potato harvest.
   Production of processing vegetables is estimated at nearly 15
million tons, while potato output is estimated at around 370
million hundredweight. The output of fresh vegetables in 1989 is
expected to be up 1 percent; mushrooms, 14 percent; sweet potatoes,
7 percent; and dry edible beans, 29 percent.
   Despite the strong increase in U.S. vegetable production, the
value of U.S. vegetable imports is expected to be up by about 5
percent to a record level, the report said Wednesday.
   ``Growth in imports during 1989 stemmed from continued strong
prices at the wholesale and retail levels, and continued strong
consumer demand,'' the report said. ``Most of the imports are fresh
vegetables, which are brought in during the winter months when U.S.
production is limited to the southern-tier states.''
   Per capita use of total vegetables rose to an estimated 336
pounds in 1988, up one pound despite drought-reduced domestic
supplies. In general, increases in fresh vegetables, potatoes and
mushrooms offset declines among processed items.
   Fresh vegetable use reached 100 pounds per capita for the first
time because of larger use of lettuce and onions, the report said.
   ``Potato use rose from 49 pounds in 1987 to 55 pounds in 1988.
This gain can be attributed entirely to large carryover stocks of
fresh potatoes,'' the report said. ``Use of frozen potatoes dropped
4 percent to 44 pounds as record exports reduced the domestic
supply.''

<HEAD>Study Shows a President's Choice of Judges Keep Alive His Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A comparison of the voting records in
environment cases of judges appointed by Presidents Carter and
Reagan supports the theory that a president's most lasting impact
may result from his judicial selections.
   Law professor William E. Kovacic said his findings may be
especially significant if President Bush chooses judges of the same
cast of mind as those appointed by Reagan. In eight years, Reagan
named 347, or 47 percent, of the nation's active federal judges,
who serve life terms.
   By the end of Bush's term in 1992, Kovacic noted, ``Reagan-Bush
nominees could account for as many as 75 percent of all federal
Court of Appeals judges.''
   When Reagan-Bush judges constitute that big a majority, Kovacic
noted, they ``might be inclined over time to endorse more extreme
positions in writing majority opinions'' because they won't feel
compelled to achieve consensus with more moderate judges.
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Kovacic said everyone knows
about the impact of a president's choices for Supreme Court
vacancies, ``but the same kind of effects, though not quite so
dramatic, can result from whom he picks for the district and
circuit courts.''
   ``Of all the tools at a president's disposal, this is an
important one,'' he said. ``If you want to make your policies
outlive your administration, this is one of the most important
means for doing that.''
   Kovacic's analysis was published by the Washington Legal
Foundation, a conservative research organization. Kovacic teaches
at George Mason University in Virginia.
   He studied how appeals court judges voted on environmental cases
arising from enactment of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.
   In 162 cases in which Reagan and Carter appointees cast 254
votes, he found that Carter's judges voted 54 percent of the time
to increase the regulatory burden on those whose pollution emission
or discharge activities were under consideration. Judges appointed
by Reagan voted that way 43 percent of the time.
   On the key District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, often
called the country's second most important court, the differences
were sharper. Carter appointees voted 48 percent of the time to
increase the pollution-fighting burden of parties before the court
while Reagan judges voted that way only half as often.
   ``The results are not entirely clear-cut,'' Kovacic concluded,
noting that when Carter and Reagan judges sat on the same panel
they rarely disagreed. ``It nonetheless appears that the Reagan
appointments on the whole succeeded in bringing less
intervention-minded judges to the courts of appeals.''
   The tendencies of judges are particularly important, Kovacic
said, in regulatory issues where Congress often gives an
administrative body, like the Environmental Protection Agency,
broad authority to implement comparatively general statutes and the
courts find themselves overseeing their work.
   Other studies have reached the same conclusion about the
long-term impact of judicial selections. Sheldon Goldman, political
scientist at the University of Massachusetts, wrote last summer
that the real impact of Reagan's appointments will reach into the
21st century and likely will be reinforced by Bush's judges.
   ``For civil libertarians this means that when the country
celebrates the bicentennial of the ratification of the Bill of
Rights in 1991, the courts will be dominated by those hostile to a
liberal reading of those rights,'' Goldman wrote. ``For judicial
conservatives, this means a healthy return to government by the
elected representatives of the people.''
   Kovacic noted speculation that substantial numbers of
Reagan-appointed judges, younger than average and often with
college-age children, may quit the bench for the higher earning
potential of law practice, especially if Congress doesn't raise
judges' salaries.
   ``The real test of whether the Reagan-Bush appointments will
have long-lasting effects depends on whether the people they have
selected will remain in those jobs,'' he said.

<HEAD>Panamanian Eyed for Key Canal Post, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Facing a Jan. 1 deadline, the Bush
administration is planning to carry out a key personnel change
required by the Panama Canal treaties without violating its policy
of avoiding contact with the Panamanian government, officials say.
   The treaties say that as of the new year, the U.S. government
commission which runs the canal must be headed by a Panamanian for
the first time in the 75-year history of the waterway.
   They also specify the Panamanian government must nominate the
administrator and the U.S. president appoint him, subject to Senate
confirmation.
   But the administration has refused to consider the nominee of
the Panamanian government, Carlos Duque. He was the official
presidential candidate in the May elections that were annulled by
Panamanian authorities amid widespread allegations of fraud.
   The administration, while promising to abide by the treaties,
has made it clear that it won't consider any nominee proposed by
Panama on grounds that the country has no legitimate government.
The administration doesn't recognize Francisco Rodriguez, the
handpicked crony of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega who was sworn in as
unelected president Sept. 1.
   U.S. officials said the dilemma is expected to be resolved by
allowing the deputy administrator of the Panama Canal Commission,
Fernando Manfredo, to take charge Jan. 1.
   As the officials see it, the ploy does not follow the letter of
the treaties but complies with the spirit in that Manfredo's
accession ensures that management of the canal will be in the hands
of a Panamanian.
   In effect, the post of administrator would be unfilled and
Manfredo would serve as acting chief until an elected government
takes office in Panama. The administration plan was first disclosed
in a Sunday New York Times column by Flora Lewis.
   Administration, congressional and diplomatic sources, all
insisting on anonymity, gave Manfredo high marks for his
performance in his 10 years as deputy administrator.
   ``His ability to run the canal is unquestioned,'' said one
congressional source.
   What is not clear is whether Manfredo will go along with a plan
that not only departs from the letter of the treaties but that also
could leave him open to charges by Noriega of acquiescing in an
anti-Panamanian gambit.
   Administration and congressional sources said Manfredo has been
approached about taking over as acting administrator but has not
responded.
   He is a former commerce minister under the late Panamanian
strongman Omar Torrijos and is said to harbor anti-Noriega
sentiments.
   The current administrator of the canal commission is Dennis
McAuliffe, a former commander of U.S. military forces in Panama who
has held his present job for 10 years.
   He will step down by Jan. 1, consistent with the treaties, and
an American will be appointed to the deputy administrator's post.
The transfer of power to Panama will be completed at the end of the
century, when Panama assumes full control of the canal.
   Noriega, who is wanted in the United States on drug trafficking
charges, has said the U.S. campaign against him is part of a plot
to evade compliance with the canal treaties.

   The National Endowment for the Arts is
refusing to pay $10,000 in previously promised support for a New
York City gallery's AIDS art show on the ground that it might
violate a new federal anti-obscenity law.
   Artists Space, the private Manhattan arts institution that is
sponsoring the exhibition, notified NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer
on Wednesday that its 23-member board had unanimously rejected his
request to relinquish the tax-paid grant.
   In response, Frohnmayer said the endowment will withhold the
$10,000 in grant money pending a legal opinion from the Justice
Department.
   ``We haven't paid out the funds, and we don't intend to do so,''
Frohnmayer said in a telephone interview.
   He also moved to disassociate the NEA from the AIDS show. In a
Nov. 3 letter to Susan Wyatt, executive director of Artists Space,
Frohnmayer asked the gallery to publish this disclaimer: ``The
National Endowment for the Arts has not supported this exhibition
or its catalog.''
   Ms. Wyatt said the gallery board was ``taking a stand against
censorship and self-censorship'' in refusing to relinquish the
grant.
   ``All of the works in the show are valid artworks,'' she said in
a telephone interview from New York. ``We believe this is a show
that should be funded by the endowment.''
   The gallery's application for an endowment grant for the $30,000
show was approved in May by the NEA, which notified the gallery of
the award in July.
   That was before Congress passed the anti-obscenity law last
month at the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. Helms and other
congressional conservatives had protested two previous endowment
grants totaling $45,000 for exhibitions of controversial art by
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano.
   In response to the New York gallery's decision, Frohnmayer said
in a telephone interview that the $10,000 grant would be withheld
because a review of the exhibition catalog made clear that ``the
nature of the show had changed from an artistic focus to a
political focus.''
   Ms. Wyatt denied the charge. ``This is not a show about
politics,'' she said. ``It's a show about AIDS.''
   The $30,000 show, which is scheduled to open at Artists Space on
Nov. 16, features works by 23 painters, sculptors and photographers
that attempt to portray the effects of AIDS on the artistic
community.
   Ms. Wyatt said the show includes a few images of male and female
nudity and ``deals with sexuality in the context of AIDS,''
although that is not the primary emphasis. ``Some of it might be
homoerotic, but I don't know,'' she said.
   The new law forbids federal support for works that ``may be
considered obscene'' by the chairman of the endowment, an
independent federal agency that spent $156 million in tax funds
last year in the form of matching grants to 4,600 artists and arts
institutions.
   Frohnmayer said he primarily objected to portions of the show's
catalog which he said contained ``very hostile, angry and
accusatory'' statements and ``very politically pointed commentary''
about Helms and other critics of controversial art and the AIDS
cause.
   In his letter to Ms. Wyatt, Frohnmayer said that ``given our
recent review, and the current political climate, I believe that
the use of endowment funds to exhibit or publish this work is in
violation of the spirit of the congressional directive.''
   He said that ``certain texts, photographs and other
representations in the exhibition may offend the language'' of the
new law.
   ``Because of the recent criticism the endowment has come under
and the seriousness of Congress' directive, we must all work
together to ensure that projects funded by the endowment do not
violate either the spirit or the letter of the law,'' Frohnmayer
wrote.
   ``The message has been clearly and strongly conveyed to us that
Congress means business.''

   Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord,
awaiting sentencing on his guilty plea to an Iran-Contra charge,
promises to cooperate with the prosecution of other defendants such
as John M. Poindexter.
   Secord pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of lying to
Congress and agreed to ``cooperate fully'' with prosecutors in
later cases in exchange for a government promise to seek dismissal
of 11 other criminal charges against him.
   Poindexter, whose criminal trial is to begin Jan. 22, is accused
of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of
making false statements.
   Secord has not yet spoken with government prosecutors and it
``remains to be seen'' what information he has to offer, said
prosecutor Reid Weingarten. The Secord case was to have gone to
trial on Monday.
   Secord, the Iran-Contra middleman enlisted by National Security
Council aide Oliver North, admitted to U.S. District Court Judge
Aubrey Robinson that he made a false statement on June 10, 1987,
when he denied to congressional investigators that he gave anything
of benefit to North.
   Poindexter has said he ``met with Gen. Secord, I guess, my whole
time in the White House maybe three or four times.''
   One of those times was in January 1986, when Poindexter said the
two discussed Secord's role in assisting upcoming arms shipments to
Iran.
   Just two months earlier, Secord had been involved at North's
request in the CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel
to Iran. The presidential finding legalizing the CIA's involvement
in the shipment was written after the Hawks were transported.
   It is unclear whether Secord and Poindexter discussed the
previous shipments in January.
   Poindexter, the former national security adviser, is accused of
lying by telling members of Congress in a closed meeting that he
didn't learn until January 1986 that the November 1985 shipment
contained Hawks.
   North had sent Poindexter a status report on the November 1985
shipment just before it took place.
   Regarding assisting the Contras, ``I was aware that Dick Secord
was going to essentially set up and run a private logistics
organization,'' Poindexter told Congress 2{ years ago.
   Poindexter said he knew that overcharges on the sale of arms to
Iran ``would go into one of the accounts that Gen. Secord had that
he would then use to purchase arms to support'' the Contras.
   But Poindexter said that when he met with Secord it was for
``mainly what I would categorize as hand-holding. ... Col. North
was always telling me that he thought Dick was losing money.''
   Secord paid the bill in 1986 for a security system at North's
home, $7,000 in cash and $9,000 drawn on a U.S. bank from profits
of ``the Enterprise,'' the maze of companies and secret Swiss bank
accounts Secord and his business partner Albert Hakim used in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Hakim is charged with two counts involving gratuities that were
to be paid to North as well as alleged conspiracy, government theft
and wire fraud.
   Secord could face up to five years in prison on the false
statement plea. The judge, who asked both sides for court filings
on whether maximum fines applicable under the law are $10,000 or
$250,000, set no date for sentencing.
   To date, four people including Secord have pleaded guilty to
various crimes in the Iran-Contra affair. North is appealing his
jury conviction of three felonies and trials are pending for
Poindexter, Secord's business partner Hakim and former CIA station
chief Joseph Fernandez.

   Under House rules, no classified information can be given to
anyone who is not a member of the intelligence panel without a vote
of the committee and without a record being kept of the information
and to whom it is given.
   But over the years, speakers of the House _ who are not members
of the committee _ have apparently been given informal briefings on
government secrets, said Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the senior
Republican on the committee.
   ``Of course, because those rules were not adhered to, few
members of the committee were aware of some of these instances, and
perhaps no one knows how many times this has occurred,'' Hyde said
in testimony Tuesday before the Rules Committee.
   The Rules panel moved to change the rules and give House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and his successors blanket access to the
Intelligence Committee's business. The matter is expected to come
before the full House next week.
   Hyde said he favors the rules change, which has been proposed by
committee Chairman Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif.
   The issue was given prominence last year when former Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, disclosed to reporters that the Central
Intelligence Agency had sought to foment civil unrest in Nicaragua
to undermine the political stability of the leftist Sandinista
government.
   Sources later said that the information had come to the
Intelligence Committee and had been relayed to Wright through an
informal briefing.
   The matter has arisen again in connection with the publication
of a new book on Wright, ``The Ambition and the Power,'' by
Washington writer John Barry, which is due in bookstores this
month. The book refers to a Nicaraguan political assessment of
Congress, intercepted by U.S. intelligence and disclosed to the
House Intelligence Committee.
   The book asserts that Wright learned of the document in a
briefing from Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, then the chairman of the
intelligence panel.
   Hyde mentioned the passage from the book when he testified
before the Rules Committee and argued for additional changes to
toughen security. His suggestions included shrinking the committee
from its current 19 members to 13, requiring members and staff to
take a secrecy oath, and requiring both members and staff to
undergo security clearances.
   All of Hyde's suggested changes were rejected by the panel,
mostly along party lines.
   Foley, who took an active interest in intelligence matters when
he was a member of the panel as House majority leader, ran into
problems when he sought to continue his contacts with the committee
after he succeeded Wright as speaker earlier this year.
   Republican members objected that a Foley staff member, Michael
J. O'Neil, was being given full access to intelligence information
and feared it would lead to other requests for access outside of
House rules.
   ``I think the speaker has a constitutional right to any
information that is in the possession of any member of Congress or
any committee of Congress,'' Foley said Tuesday. He said he
believed when he was a member of the panel that it was his
obligation to provide Wright with any information he requested.
   ``If there is any member of Congress who should be fully
informed on matters within the purview of the Intelligence
Committee, it is the speaker, first,'' Foley said.

<HEAD>EPA Says 36 Urban Areas Violate Clean Air Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governors of 16 states are being told to
tighten state air quality requirements and bring 36 urban areas
into compliance with federal clean air standards.
   The directive stems from findings earlier this year that
revealed the 36 areas were in violation of federal air quality
standards, bringing the number of such areas exceeding the
standards to 102.
   Under the federal Clean Air Act, states are responsible for
developing air quality plans so that urban areas meet federal ozone
and carbon monoxide pollution standards.
   The list of urban areas found in violation were released last
July.
   In a letter to the 16 governors the EPA said the states would
have one year to develop a first phase improved air quality
compliance plan. This could include tighter enforcement of existing
state pollution control regulations and the adoption of additional
regulations already planned but not yet put into effect, said EPA
spokesman Dave Ryan.
   The Agency noted these actions should be pursued despite an
expectation that Congress will soon enact a new federal clean air
law that likely will impose stiffer pollution control requirements.
   The 16 states contacted, with urban areas non in compliance in
parenthesis, were:
   New York (Albany-Schenectady-Troy area, Buffalo-Niagara,
Poughkeepsie, Essex County); Pennsylvania (Altoona, Erie,
Harrisburg-Lebanon-Carlisle area, Johnstown, Lancaster, Reading,
Scranton-Wilkes Barre area, York, Sharon); Kentucky (Bowling Green,
Owensboro, Paducah);
   Ohio (Canton, Columbus, Dayton-Springfield, Toledo,
Youngstown-Warren); West Virginia (Charleston, Greenbriar County);
Indiana (South Bend-Mishawaka-Elkhart area, Evansville); North
Carolina (Greensboro-Winston Salem-High Point area, Fayetteville);
South Carolina (Greenville-Spartanburg) Tennessee (Knoxville)
Louisiana (Lake Charles); Maine (Lewiston-Auburn, Waldo County);
New Hampshire (Manchester); Delaware (Sussex County); California
(San Diego); Wisconsin (Winnebago County); Oregon (Klamath County).
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
      Eds: The above lists 37 locations in noncompliance because of
the state-by-state breakdown, instead of 36 as reported by the EPA.
The EPA considers Youngstown-Warren, Ohio and Sharon, Pa., to be
one ``urban area,'' but in the breakdown they are listed separately
under their respective states.

   The spirit of glasnost, which prompted plans
for a Miss Soviet-American pageant and exchange program, has Peoria
and Chicago squaring off.
   Peoria leaders said Wednesday they're wooing pageant organizers,
who feel snubbed by Chicago because it never responded to their
request to become a sister-city with Kiev and be host of the
pageant.
   ``The organizers in New York are very interested in Peoria
because it's an All-American city,'' said Mayor Jim Maloof.
   Chicago officials acknowledged they fumbled arrangements for the
pageant. But they aren't giving up now.
   ``In the last two years, we've been through significant
political upheaval in this city. Sister-city proposals and beauty
pageants just haven't been high priorities,'' said Avis LaVelle,
spokeswoman for Mayor Richard Daley. ``But no city wants to lose a
pageant or international event like this.''
   The pageant focuses on Soviet and American history and culture,
emphasizing talent and intelligence over beauty. One contest will
be in Moscow in January, one in a U.S. city in the spring, leading
to an exchange of pageant queens.
   It is being organized by the Slavic American Cultural
Association in New York.
   Paul Wisniewski, a representative of the group, said Peoria
might have an edge partially because the Soviets are ``familiar
with that famous phrase, `How does it play in Peoria.'''

   After listening to Darwin McElderry, no
wonder no one in Exline wants to run for mayor or city council.
   ``We just don't have the money to do nothin' and nobody's taking
much interest,'' he said Wednesday. ``We haven't hardly got a road
that you can get over in with a car down here; no way to get it
fixed; just about got to ride a horse.''
   ``Nobody seems to care about nothin' down here. They could care
less about everything,'' McElderry said. ``Everybody hollers at
you. You can't get nothin' done. There's always a somebody
a-gripin'.''
   On election day Tuesday, there were no announced candidates for
mayor or five city council seats in the southern Iowa town.
   Of the 91 registered voters, 22 cast ballots, according to
Appanoose County Auditor Linda Demry.
   The mayor, Bob Traxler, received 13 write-in votes for his sixth
term. McElderry was re-elected to the city council.
   But McElderry said voters should have scribbled in another name.
He plans to resign.

   Nissan Motor Corp.'s ads for its new
Infiniti models will retain their focus on fuzzy images of nature
such as ponds of trout and gentle cloudbursts rather than the
high-performance luxury cars.
   ``There are more rocks and pussywillows to come,'' William
Bruce, Nissan's general manager for the Infiniti line, said at a
ceremony Wednesday marking the day the cars officially went on sale.
   Enough already, say some observers.
   Now that the car is on sale, ``sooner or later they've got to
bring it out in the ads,'' said Arvid Jouppi, an auto analyst with
Keane Securities in Chicago. ``You may talk to the girl on the
phone, but you don't propose to her that way. Some things you need
to do face to face.''
   Ronald Glantz, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco, said he didn't know whether the ``feel-good''
advertising will work.
   ``But this is not like getting Joe Sixpack to stir from his
television. The guy who is going to spend $40,000 is going to check
it out,'' Glantz said.
   Infiniti has two models: the Q45 fullsize four-door sedan, with
a base price of $38,000, and the M30 sports coupe at $23,500.

   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Thursday, while the key barometer on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
recovered from its early setback and rose.
   The dollar closed at 142.70 yen, down 0.27 yen from Wednesday's
close of 142.97 yen. It started trading higher at 143.33 yen and
ranged between 142.67 yen and 143.33 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
slightly during morning trading, made up its losses and gained
61.83 points, or 0.17 percent, finishing the day at 35,657.42.
   Dealers said the index started to recover when foreign
securities firms bought spot issues for option trading. Thursday
was the last day for trading November options.
   An estimated 800 million shares changed hands on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's first section.
   In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate moved nervously due to
uncertainties over U.S. monetary policy after the currency's higher
start, traders said.
   The rate will move tightly but nervously ahead of a rescheduled
auction of U.S. Treasury securities, a dealer from the Bank of
Tokyo said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. Treasury Department Wednesday rescheduled a quarterly
auction of $56 billion in securities to prevent the government from
running out of cash before it raised the federal debt limit.

<HEAD>Congress Split Over Use of Vouchers for Child Care Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new debate over the use of vouchers for
children's programs is ensnarling a last-ditch effort by House and
Senate negotiators to salvage a child care bill before Congress
adjourns this year.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, insisted Wednesday that states be
allowed to issue vouchers to parents for both a new preschool
education program and new before- and after-school care services
that would be established in the legislation.
   Hatch, who has encountered wrath from the Bush administration
and conservative groups for joining with liberals on child care
standards, also wants governors to have more discretion on how the
new money is spent.
   ``This is it for child care,'' he told House negotiators. ``If
we can't put this together, then it's going to go down the drain.''
   The vouchers, which are supported by the administration, would
effectively allow a portion of the new aid to flow through parents
to churches and parochial schools which provide child care services.
   Most liberal Democrats, with support from unionized teachers and
other public employees, want the money to instead go directly to
care providers. They succeeded in getting a large portion of the
funds in both Senate and House versions devoted to making public
schools become day care centers for so-called ``latchkey'' children
of working parents.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., an adamant opponent of
vouchers, reluctantly agreed to allow a limited use of them in
subsidizing only day care services for pre-kindergarten children
and ``no one else.''
   Both the House and Senate have approved separate measures to
double the $1.5 billion to $2 billion now spent annually on direct
subsidies for child care services. They also would provide $11
billion to $13.5 billion in new tax credits over the next five
years to low-income families with children and require states to
regulate care providers.
   But the Senate version would give governors much more discretion
than the House measure on how the new direct aid is spent. It would
also allow them to dedicate a portion of the funds for issuing
vouchers that parents could use to pay the care provider of their
choice.
   The House version has no provision for vouchers. But upon
passing the bill last month, Democratic House leaders instructed
their negotiators to accept a limited use of them.

<TEXT>
   Perhaps the biggest splash of the royal visit
to Hong Kong has been the exclusive photos of Princess Diana
swimming at a British naval base pool that fetched $40,000 in a
frenzied Fleet Street bidding war.
   The London tabloid Daily Star paid about 25,000 British pounds
($39,750) for the series of pictures, outbidding about nine rivals,
Edward Hung, group general manager of the Sing Tao Newspapers, said
today.
   British reporters flooded the newspaper's offices after the
pictures appeared in the Wednesday edition of the Sing Tao Wan Pao,
a Chinese-language afternoon newspaper.
   ``It was crazy,'' said Hung. ``It was a madhouse.''
   A photographer for the local Chinese-language newspaper
positioned atop an adjacent hotel had snapped the pictures early
Wednesday.
   The photographs showed the princess, wearing a red one-piece
bathing suit, diving into the pool and swimming backstroke. Another
shot showed her walking barefoot outside the pool with a white
towel wrapped around her body.
   A picture of Diana swimming backstroke covered nearly the entire
front page of today's edition of the Daily Star under the headline
``Di in Peril.''
   The newspaper claimed that the ability of the photographer to
take such pictures showed ``gaping holes'' in her security.

   Amnesty International said today that Nicaraguan
troops have summarily executed dozens of unarmed peasants during
operations against the Contras while abuses by the U.S.-backed
rebels against civilians have dropped.
   The international human rights group said in a report that the
Sandinista government has imprisoned some soldiers for unlawful
killings of civilians; pledged to investigate other such killings;
improved legal protection for detainees; and freed more than 2,000
political prisoners since 1986.
   It also said, however, that since an April 1988 cease-fire there
has been no sign of a decline in non-combat killings and
``disappearances'' of civilians blamed on security forces.
   President Daniel Ortega suspended the 19-month-old truce last
week, but government and Contra delegations were to begin meeting
today in New York for the first direct peace talks since June 1988
on ending the 8-year-old conflict.
   The Contras are supposed to disband and leave their Honduran
camps voluntarily by early December under an Aug. 7 agreement
signed by Nicaragua and four other Central American governments.
The rebels were not a party to the agreement, and so far most have
shown no inclination to lay down their weapons and return home.
   Amnesty said the fate or whereabouts of scores of civilians who
disappeared after being arrested still have not been clarified.
   Army units allegedly have killed dozens of unarmed civilians in
provinces bordering Honduras and Costa Rica and in Indian-dominated
regions on the Atlantic coast where fighting against the Contras
once was intense, the report said.
   In many cases, the victims allegedly were singled out ``in
punishment or reprisal for no other reason that their suspected
sympathy or support for the insurgent forces,'' it said.
   Witnesses also have alleged that unarmed peasants have been shot
to death while fleeing army patrols seeking to enforce military
conscription, it said.
   ``It appears that, following the withdrawal of Contra forces,
some military units ... are resorting to killings during operations
to identify or neutralize networks of suspected Contra supporters
and sympathizers,'' the report said.
   ``Punitive action by the government, while indicating that it
does not condone such abuses, has so far been insufficient to halt
them,'' it added.
   It said the precise circumstances of the killings are often
difficult or impossible to establish because there are no
independent witnesses.
   The authorities contend that in some cases soldiers acted in
self-defense because victims were suspected of being armed, hostile
or dangerous. Military investigations have suggested other killings
were criminal acts involving ``personal quarrels, or the reckless
firing of weapons by drunken soldiers.''
   Amnesty said reports persist of forced recruitment, torture and
executions of civilians by the U.S.-backed rebels, but said such
abuses have dropped significantly in the past year.
   ``Preventive measures reportedly adopted by these forces to
improve the conduct of their troops appear to have had little
effect,'' the report said, but the number of reported abuses ``has
declined significantly since the winding down of military activity
in 1988 and 1989.''
   The report documents 56 cases of unlawful executions by
Nicaraguan troops between 1987 and 1989.
   In three separate cases in which 10 civilians were killed, the
government sentenced 17 military and police personnel to prison
terms ranging from six years to the maximum 30 years, the report
said.
   In other cases, investigations either have been suspended or are
incomplete, it said.
   It described how the mutilated bodies of five Catholic lay
preachers were found a day after they were allegedly abducted by
troops searching for suspected Contras in the village of Apantillo
on March 21, 1988. A military commission cleared army troops in
nearby Matiguas of involvement, but villagers insisted the troops
were responsible.
   Amnesty said it based its findings on three visits to Nicaragua,
and its sources included relatives of those killed, disappeared or
imprisoned.
   Nicaragua lifted a state of emergency in January 1988, restoring
many civil and political rights that had been suspended for nearly
six years, the report said.

   American citizens living and working abroad
say they are unfairly taxed and unjustly deprived of many benefits
available to all other Americans, including representation in
Congress.
   House members, in response, are setting up an unofficial
Congressional Task Force on Overseas Americans to provide a forum
to air the complaints.
   Andrew P. Sundberg, director of American Citizens Abroad and a
resident of Geneva, Switzerland, told a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Wednesday that U.S. citizens living overseas could
be a great asset to their native land.
   ``And yet, in many ways, we find that the U.S. government is at
war with those of us who live abroad, and it is a war which we are
losing,'' he said.
   ``We view our overseas citizens as a threat, and as a liability
that needs to be carefully controlled,'' Sundberg told the
international operations subcommittee.
   Sundberg and other witnesses complained the United States is the
only country which taxes its citizens on income earned abroad,
exposing them to double taxation since they are also subject to the
tax codes of the countries in which they work.
   He said that such countries as West Germany, France and Japan
provide schools for their citizens living in other countries, but
the United States does not.
   Sundberg noted France also allows overseas citizens to
participate in the nation's legislative process, setting aside 12
seats in the French Senate for members elected by the overseas
French community.
   ``Many federal programs do not reach beyond the water's edge,''
Sundberg said, contending more than 100,000 Americans abroad are
denied Medicare benefits even though they have paid for them
through their taxes.
   He said there is a health benefit available to veterans, but it
cuts off at age 65 because Medicare is supposed to start.
   ``It doesn't overseas,'' Sundberg said, noting the health
benefits for veterans terminate anyway.
   Sundberg also said a provision of U.S. law cuts off monthly
supplemental Social Security benefits for people who live outside
the United States for more than 30 consecutive days.
   And he said children born to Americans living abroad are often
denied U.S. citizenship in their own right.
   Sundberg endorsed legislation introduced earlier this year by
Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., to permit Americans residing overseas
to be represented in Congress by a non-voting delegate to the House
of Representatives.
   He also endorsed bills introduced by Alexander to expand the
types of income earned abroad which may be excluded from U.S. taxes
and to make it easier for Americans abroad to pass on their U.S.
citizenship to their children.
   Witnesses for other organizations, including the American
Chambers of Commerce Abroad, contended that improving the tax
status of overseas Americans would help reduce the U.S. trade
deficit by making American companies more competitive with their
overseas rivals.

<TEXT>
   NBC News President Michael G. Gartner says his
``passion for openness'' drove him to wage an expensive,
little-publicized legal battle against the Voice of America, the
government's radio station.
   As a result, Gartner says VOA has changed its policies, giving
Americans more access to editorial material it broadcasts in 43
languages around the world. The Voice's charter prohibits it from
broadcasting inside the United States.
   ``They've changed their position on three fundamental issues,''
said Gartner, who built a file a foot thick in a fight that began
in the early 1980s when Gartner was editor of The Des Moines
Register and Tribune.
   ``I think that means there is more freedom of the press in this
country and I'm intensely interested in that,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   VOA officials challenge Gartner's contention they've shifted
positions, but acknowledge they have taken steps to ensure VOA
employees properly implement existing policies.
   Gartner was drawn into the case by Gil Cranberg, the Register's
former editorial page editor. Cranberg thought it would be
interesting to see what kind of editorials VOA was sending abroad
over the airwaves.
   When a Register staffer went to check the editorials, he ran
into ``severe obstacles,'' recalled Cranberg, now a journalism
professor at the University of Iowa. ``We were told they
(editorials) could not be disseminated.''
   Cranberg told his boss about the situation. ``Mike was pretty
incensed,'' he said.
   After years of trying to get the policy changed, Gartner filed a
lawsuit against the U.S. Information Agency _ VOA's parent _ in
June 1988 in Des Moines' federal court.
   The lawsuit was filed in Iowa because Gartner, a lawyer, also is
editor and co-owner of The Daily Tribune in Ames, Iowa, a newspaper
with a circulation of about 10,500.
   Although Judge Donald E. O'Brien dismissed the lawsuit last
month, Gartner said ``a funny thing happened on the way to the
ruling.'' Namely, the VOA now allows the following, he said.
   _Americans may publish any information they receive from VOA.
Only USIA employees are barred from disseminating the information.
   _The general public, not just special interest groups like
reporters, members of Congress and historians, is allowed access to
VOA materials, such as editorials.
   _Anyone can copy the information, although they aren't allowed
to photocopy it.
   Summing up the changes, Gartner said: ``One, is I can print it;
two, is the average guy can look at it, and three, is any of us can
copy, and that's a big, big change in my view.''
   Alberto Mora, VOA's general counsel, disputed Gartner's
statements. ``In general, that's not true. ... The court points to
no evidence that we've changed any interpretation of the statute,''
he said.
   Mora said, however, that Gartner may have received some
``confusing sorts of statements'' about policies from lower-level
employees. Gartner said the Voice is simply ``diplomatically
defending their change of position.''
   Meantime, Gartner said he considers his effort well worth his
time and money. Joining Gartner in the lawsuit were Ralph
Rosenberg, an Iowa state representative, and Partnership
Independent Press Inc., the Daily Tribune's parent company.
   ``I have this passion for openness and for freedom of speech and
for democracy,'' said Gartner, who became president of NBC News in
August 1988.
   While battles have been won, the war is not over.
   Gartner intends to push Congress to change VOA's legislation so
the public may photocopy editorials, instead of having to copy them
by hand.

   Closer-than-predicted margins in Virginia's
gubernatorial election and New York's mayoral contest may have a
simple explanation, some pollsters say: Survey respondents lied.
   That could explain why black candidates in the two races ran
less well Tuesday than expected. The theory is that voters who
opposed them hesitated to say so for fear of appearing bigoted.
   It even has a name: ``The Bradley effect,'' for Los Angeles
Mayor Tom Bradley, a black Democrat who led in the polls in his
1982 race for governor only to lose narrowly to his white opponent,
George Deukmejian.
   ``I think a lot of people cast their votes on race, and it's
something that's not easily measured by polls,'' pollster Brad
Coker said Wednesday. ``People are not going to freely admit
they're racists to strangers.''
   In unofficial returns, black Democrat L. Douglas Wilder led
white Republican J. Marshall Coleman by about 5,500 votes for
governor of Virginia, and black Democrat David Dinkins won New
York's mayoralty by just 2 points.
   Both led by greater margins in pre-election surveys, and even in
surveys of voters leaving their polling places Tuesday.
   Did some of those voters lie to the pollsters?
   ``You bet,'' said Steve Shaw, poll director for Media General
Inc. in Richmond, Va. ``There's a socially acceptable answer that
some people feel they should give. But when it comes down to making
a decision, they tend to vote using other criteria.''
   Other pollsters argue that the answers are more complex _ and
that most pre-election polls were not that far off. In Virginia,
the last three polls before the election put Wilder's support at 45
percent, 52 percent and 48 _ not that far from the roughly 50
percent he received.
   What they understated was Coleman's support, estimated at 36, 41
and 44 percent respectively; he also received about 50 percent in
the end.
   In New York, similarly, Dinkins had 51 percent in a final
pre-election poll by The Gallup Organization, about what he
received. White Republican Rudolph W. Giuliani, however, was polled
at 37 percent; he got 48 percent.
   ``The undecideds, or the people who weren't saying, broke
heavily for the Republican,'' said Gallup pollster Larry Hugick.
   Those people, almost all of them whites, may have been
uncomfortable saying they opposed the black candidate, Hugick said.
But he also raised another possibility: ``They truly hadn't made up
their minds.''
   Indeed, in many previous elections pitting a black and a white,
``the people who are undecided ... have traditionally moved toward
the white candidate,'' said Kathleen A. Frankovic, a pollster at
CBS News. If polls on Tuesday's election reflected that, she
suggested, they would have been near the mark.
   ``I think that people are choosing to ascribe an easy
explanation, i.e., lying, when there other methodological
explanations available,'' Frankovic said. ``They're just harder to
write about, harder to talk about, and the words are longer.''
   Still, Coker, who polled in Virginia, saw no other explanation
for his exit poll result Tuesday: It found a 55-45 percent victory
for Wilder among voters leaving their polling places, far
overstating the black candidate's showing and understating the
white's. But on two other races, in which there were no black
candidates, Coker's results proved almost exactly correct.
   ``The history of exit polling and other polling has been that
when there's no racial issue involved, they're pretty accurate.
When there is, you're never quite sure,'' said Coker. ``You can
only go with what the people tell you.''

<HEAD>Haiti Paralyzed By Strike Protesting Alleged Torture Of Opposition
Leaders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, (AP) _ Most businesses and schools
remained closed on the second day of a widely observed 48-hour
strike to protest the arrest and apparent being in police custody
of three opposition leaders.
   Transportation in Port-au-Prince and all other major cities in
Haiti was paralyzed Wednesday, the second day of the strike.
Government trucks providing free transportation were virtually
empty.
   Almost all the estimated 15,000 factory workers at the
industrial park, on the north side of this city of 1 million, did
not report to work.
   No violence was reported.
   ``The success of the strike will give the army food for thought.
Human rights and the constitution have got to be respected,''
conservative politician Francois Latortue said in an interview.
   The goverment on Nov. 2 accused Jean-Auguste Mesyeux, co-leader
of Haiti's largest union; Evans Paul and Etienne Marino of
conspiring to assassinate Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril and
superior officers and to blow up the presidential palace.
   The three were displayed on state television that night with
swollen faces, bandaged heads and bloodied shirts _ apparently
resulting from beatings.
   ``The aim of their appearance on television was probably to
terrorize the population,'' said Latortue, a former justice
minister and presidential candidate.
   ``We thought we had put an end to such police brutality in
1986'' when dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in
France, he said.
   Outraged by the television display, nearly 100 human rights,
political, civic and neighborhood groups rallied to the strike
called by Mesyeux's union, the Autonomous Central of Haitian
Workers.
   ``It is a strike of the revolted conscience,'' Communist Party
leader Rene Theodore said.
   ``Avril has no credibility left to govern with. He must release
the three prisoners, and he must resign,'' said conservative
political leader Louis Dejoie.
   Haiti's bishops, in a statement broadcast by the Roman Catholic
Church-owned Radio Soleil Tuesday night, expressed shocked at the
resurgence of police brutality and urged respect for human rights.
   The three men began a hunger strike at the National Penitentiary
Monday. Lawyers and relatives have been refused permission to visit
them, private Radio Haiti Inter said.
   Paul is leader of the Confederation for Democratic Unity party
and Marino is a member of the Popular Organization of September 17,
which was inspired by the September 1988 soldiers' coup that ousted
Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and brought Avril to power.
   The three were arrested Nov. 1, allegedly in possession of
weapons and explosives, a day after co-signing a communique of the
National Assembly, a coalition of 20 leftist and conservative
groups, calling for a month of anti-government marches.

   Trucks and railcars are hauling garbage into
America's breadbasket and then carrying food on the way back with
little or no cleaning in between, according to testimony on Capitol
Hill.
   Witnesses told a House panel of trucks that carry meat and solid
waste on alternate trips, trailers that haul food along with
insects left from garbage runs and diesel fuel from one shipment
seeping into flour in the next cargo.
   ``Would you like your bacon and eggs delivered on any of these
trucks?'' Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., asked the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials
on Wednesday.
   The subcommittee is considering legislation on hazardous
materials safety, including a ban on so-called ``backhauling'' of
garbage to Midwestern dumps after shipments of food to the east.
   ``The need to dispose of waste at long distance landfills
coincides with the desire of trucking companies to obtain a
`backhaul' from the East,'' said Bernard Gaillard of the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
   The ICC traced the activities of one refrigerated truck trailer
that was seen at a Poland, Ohio, landfill and a Newark, N.J., waste
transfer station. Investigators found that of 29 loads it carried
over three months, eight were meat cargoes, six were solid waste
and 15 others were listed as miscellaneous shipments.
   Gaillard said that at a Hubbard, Ohio, truck washing station,
investigators found one truck that hauled avocados from California
before picking up a load of trash still reeked of garbage after the
washing.
   He said truck trailers were routinely rinsed with hot water not
exceeding 100 degrees and with no detergent or other cleaning agent.
   Terri Moore, president of Hoosiers Opposed to Polluting the
Environment, said maggots survived the cleaning of non-refrigerated
trailers that made what she described as a ``Midwest garbage run''
to the private Center Point, Ind., Landfill.
   ``When one truck driver was questioned if this was a `standard
cleaning job,' he replied, `Yes, once the liquid is absorbed into
the wood the maggots crawl into the moist cracks and the flies
later hatch,''' she said.
   Moore, whose group has a ``Dump Patrol'' that monitors the
landfill, said she also witnessed shippers use the same tarpaulin
to cover garbage and shipments of produce. She said there was
evidence of medical waste being hauled, and one trucker allegedly
was stuck by a needle and contracted AIDS.
   Aldan H. Fitch of the Washington state Department of Agriculture
contaminated loads have caused serious economic consequences.
   He said in one case, more than $1 million worth of dairy cattle
died and milk had to be dumped for four weeks when a rail car
bringing an arsenic compound to a Tacoma smelter took on a load of
feed grain afterward.
   After some state residents complained of oily-tasting biscuits,
Fitch said, inspectors discovered that two boxcars of flour were
hauled in a car that had carried barrels of diesel oil.
   In another case, fresh market potatoes got a green coating when
lead-based paint pigment was not cleaned from a car carrying the
tubers, he said.

<HEAD>Energy Advisers Doubt Near-Term Potential for Accelerator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Department advisers are casting doubt
on suggestions that a linear accelerator may be a cheaper and safer
way of making tritium _ a key nuclear warhead ingredient _ than new
nuclear reactors now on the drawing board.
   An advisory panel to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said in a
draft report released Wednesday that a main problem with an
accelerator is that large amounts of electricity would be needed to
run the facility.
   The Energy Research Advisory Board was meeting today to review
the report.
   Watkins has strongly supported a plan, prepared by his Reagan
administration predecessor, to build two new nuclear reactors to
make tritium. They would replace government reactors in South
Carolina that are nearing the end of their useful lives. The new
reactors are estimated to cost at least $6.8 billion.
   The department has said it needs to get started on replacements
for the South Carolina reactors soon, so it would rather pursue the
relatively simple reactor option instead of the accelerator
technology, which is not fully developed.
   But scientists at two Energy Department laboratories concluded
earlier this year that a linear accelerator would be cheaper and
safer than a new reactor and could be ready sooner. In August,
Watkins asked his advisers to study how soon an accelerator might
be feasible and at what cost.
   An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a
target, in this case lithium clad in aluminium. The resulting
collision produces tritium.
   In a separate report Wednesday, the advisory panel said claims
for the discovery of a new nuclear process called ``cold fusion''
are too weak to justify special government research efforts.
   The group told Watkins it found no persuasive evidence that the
cold fusion process first claimed by University of Utah scientists
last March would produce useful sources of energy. If such a
process could work on a large scale it would make possible
limitless supplies of cheap energy.
   ``Nuclear fusion at room temperature would be contrary to all
understanding gained of nuclear reactions in the last half century;
it would require the existence of an as-yet-undiscovered nuclear
process,'' the report said.
   The advisory board said a chief concern about the accelerator is
that it would require 800 megawatts of continuous power _ nearly
the equivalent of the entire output of a large commercial power
station.
   The board called this power requirement ``an amount that is not
only costly but may not be readily available in the time frame of
the years 2000 to 2040'' when the accelerator would be working.
   It said a new power station _ possibly a nuclear reactor _ might
have to be built just to provide electricity for the accelerator.
   ``It may be simpler, in fact, to use a nuclear reactor to
produce tritium directly ... rather than have it, or a fossil
plant, produce electricity to operate the accelerator,'' the report
said.
   The board's report said this and other issues would be
considered in greater detail before next February, when a final
report is due to Watkins.

   A Jewish soldier who says he saved his
battalion by singlehandedly shooting to death more than 500
Japanese soldiers may soon receive the Medal of Honor he believes
was denied because of his religion.
   Marshaling the support of a U.S. senator, an authenticated
photograph taken from the body of a Japanese soldier, and
affidavits from two former commanders, David S. Rubitsky thinks he
has enough evidence to win official recognition 47 years after the
deed.
   Rubitsky, 72, believes he was nominated for a Medal of Honor
during World War II but denied the award because of the actions of
an anti-Semitic commander. He has vowed to keep fighting for the
award.
   ``If I give up, I'm beaten and I'm a fighter,'' Rubitsky said in
an interview last year. ``If I lose, the Jewish people lose and
then I'm going to let them down.''
   According to Rubitsky's story, the heroic deed took place Dec.
1-2, 1942, in a New Guinea swamp known as ``The Triangle,'' during
an attack by Japanese troops on Rubitsky's 128th Infantry unit.
   The former communications sergeant jumped into a machine gun
fortification after it was abandoned by other soldiers and fired
nearly 3,500 rounds of ammunition on the Japanese during 21 hours.
   Officials investigating Rubitsky's complaint said a photograph
discovered this spring has brought strong credence to his claim.
They officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Rubitsky came across the photograph in March while visiting an
Army companion in Mesa, Ariz. The photograph, reportedly taken from
the pocket of dead Japanese soldier, shows a group picture of a
Japanese military unit.
   A handwritten message in Japanese on the back said the picture's
bearer had decided to commit suicide after he and other officers
sent men into a battle in which ``600 fine Japanese soldiers died
because of a solitary American soldier.''
   Sen. Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., began working on Rubitsky's behalf in
January and had the photograph examined this spring.
   The Secret Service confirmed the photo was printed on paper from
1942 and the writing was from ink produced in 1942. The note on the
back was interpreted by the Library of Congress.
   ``Based on my review of the evidence, as well as the contacts my
office has had with Mr. Rubitsky, I have concluded that he earned
the Medal of Honor,'' Kohl said.
   Maj. Joe Padilla of the Army Awards Branch in Washington, D.C.,
said a review of Rubitsky's case began in January 1988 and a
decision should be issued by the end of the year.
   Under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, all recommendations for a medal
from World War II had to have been submitted by May 1951. Thus
investigators must determine whether a recommendation was made for
Rubitsky, and if so whether anti-Semitism played on role in the
denial of the award, Padilla said.
   He said the investigation into the medal ``must prove
incontestable evidence. This is very difficult to do, after nearly
half a century.''
   Rubitsky has declined interviews recently, saying he wants to
wait for the Army's decision.
   But in an editorial he wrote for the Milwaukee Sentinel last
year, he said he was told in 1986 that his former commanding
officers had nominated him for a medal.Rubitsky said he then began
investigating why he hadn't received it.
   Joseph Stehling, a retired brigadier general who lives in Beaver
Dam, signed an affidavit outlining Rubitsky's actions and
confirming he nominated Rubitsky for the honor. Retired Gen.
Herbert Smith, who died in September, signed a similar affidavit.
   Another affidavit signed by a military messenger said Col. John
Mott, now dead, had denied Rubitsky his medal because Rubitsky was
Jewish.
   In the 1988 interview, Rubitsky said he had received numerous
anti-Semitic phone calls and threats after deciding to fight for
the medal.
   ``It's not really the medal,'' he said. ``It is the
anti-Semitism that existed then and still exists now. I want people
to know there is still discrimination.''

   Brian Swierczek's recovery from leukemia is being
aided by a computer that keeps him in touch with classmates and his
fourth-grade teacher, who transmits assignments from 3,000 miles
away.
   Two months after Brian was diagnosed with leukemia in June, the
family temporarily moved from Media, Pa., so the 9-year-old could
undergo a bone marrow transplant at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center.
   Electronic mail from friends, as well as daily school
assignments, arrive via a computer service offered by Prodigy
Services Co., a joint venture of IBM and Sears.
   Forget the classwork, says Brian, who's more interested in
keeping up with his pals and playing games on the computer with two
younger brothers who have joined him for his recovery at an
apartment near the hospital.
   With the extra attention being shown Brian, his mother, June,
has used the computer to begin her Christmas shopping and Brian's
father, Tim, relied on Prodigy to reserve airline tickets for the
family's Dec. 23 trip back to the Philadelphia suburb.
   IBM loaned the family a computer, Sears loaned Brian's
elementary school a computer, and Prodigy donated the software and
three free months of the service to both parties, said George
Twiss, Seattle branch manager for Prodigy.
   The White Plains, N.Y.-based service allows users to communicate
with subscribers across the country using local phone lines. It
offers services such as news, weather, movie reviews and stock
prices for a $9.95 a month.
   Brian's mother said she's hoping her son's communications with
the school will prevent him from repeating the fourth grade. Just
as important, she said, is keeping Brian in close touch with his
classmates.
   Mrs. Swierczek said the computer service helps Brian feel closer
to his classmates.
   ``They're don't really talk on the phone at this age,'' Mrs.
Swierczek said. But his friends are all very interested in the
computer and frequently leave messages, even the girls, she said.
   ``It definitely makes him feel more in touch,'' Mrs. Swierczek
said.
   The family came to Seattle after chemotherapy treatments in
Philadelphia failed to cure Brian and the wait for a bone marrow
transplant there was too long, Mrs. Swierczek said.
   Swierczek's bone marrow was found to be the closest match to his
son's and, on Sept. 9, it was transplanted during a 10-hour
operation.
   Brian has made it past the point where he would have an acute
rejection of the transplant, Mrs. Swierczek said. But doctors must
wait 100 days after a transplant before they know if Brian needs
treatment with steroids to maintain his body's acceptance of his
father's bone marrow, she said.
   Brian was released from the hospital Oct. 4. But since his
immune system is still weakened from the transplants and
chemotherapy, he mainly stays in the house to avoid contracting
illnesses.

   A woman who accused Miss West Virginia of
pulling a gun on her after a traffic accident denied running the
pageant winner off a road and beating her head against the pavement
during their fracas.
   ``I didn't do either of those things,'' said Tammy Boyce, 23, of
Fairmont, who was charged with reckless driving, battery and
destruction of property after the altercation Tuesday morning with
Lisa Bittinger, 21.
   Bittinger filed a criminal complaint alleging that Boyce kicked
out a window on her car, grabbed her by the hair and beat her head
against the pavement while screaming obscenities at her after
Bittinger's car ran into a telephone pole.
   ``I admit I pulled her hair and kicked the window out of her
car, but I didn't do any of the other things she said I did,''
Boyce said in an interview Wednesday.
   Boyce filed a complaint saying Bittinger pulled a gun on her
during the altercation. Police arrested Bittinger and charged her
with brandishing a deadly weapon.
   Both women were arraigned on the misdemeanor charges Tuesday
night. Bittinger was freed on a $200 personal recognizance bond and
Boyce set free on a $350 personal recognizance bond, said Peggy
Twyman, the Marion County magistrate.
   No hearing date has been set.
   Bittinger faces up to six months in jail and a $200 fine if
convicted on the weapon charge.
   Several telephone calls to Bittinger's residence Wednesday were
answered by a machine. She had not returned the calls by late
Wednesday.
   Jodi Bice, Bittinger's traveling companion and business manager,
said Bittinger told her she didn't have a weapon.
   ``She said there was no gun and I've never known her to have
one,'' Bice said.
   In her written complaint, Bittinger said her car hit a pole
after Boyce ran her car off the road. Bittinger told police that
Boyce had been following her.
   Bittinger alleged that Boyce came to her car, reached inside her
sunroof and grabbed her hair. Bittinger said she pulled free and
locked her doors, then Boyce kicked out her window while screaming
obscenities and tried to pull her out of the car by her hair.
   ``I unlocked the door and got out,'' Bittinger's complaint said.
``She threw me on the ground and beat my head on the pavement by
holding my hair.
   ``A witness pulled her off of me. She continued to laugh as she
got into the car and drove off.''
   Boyce's complaint alleged that Bittinger pulled a gun on her
while Bittinger was in her car.
   Boyce said the two had confronted each other before, and that
the latest incident happened after both had left a Fairmont bar
about the same time early Tuesday.
   Boyce also said that Bittinger had dated one of her former
boyfriends, but denied a published report that that had figured
into the altercation.
   ``I've never gotten along with her. It's like every time I see
her she gives me dirty looks,'' Boyce said.
   Jack Leeson, executive director of the Miss West Virginia
Scholarship Pageant, said no decision would be made on whether
Bittinger could lose her title until the court cases are settled.

   A large sign lists all Masses in
Polish, but the hundreds of ethnic Germans headed for the
mountain-top monastery in this former German region are coming to
pray in their mother tongue.
   Franciscan monks have allowed celebration of Sunday Mass in
German since June, and word has spread quickly among the thousands
of ethnic Germans scattered throughout southwestern Poland.
   Although gasoline is in short supply, worshipers often drive
more than an hour each Sunday to gather at one of the few churches
in Poland to offer services in German.
   A tightly-knit community, ethnic Germans in Poland are estimated
by the International Red Cross to number 80,000. Most are
concentrated in the former German territories of Silesia and East
Prussia.
   Ethnic Germans had hoped for a large turnout on Sunday, when
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany was to attend a
German-language Mass at the Mount St. Ann monastery, known in
German as Annaberg.
   The trip to the monastery was scratched, however, because the
government was uncomfortable over a visit to the area, the site of
a fierce battle in 1921 between Polish and German partisans over
whether the area would go to Poland or Germany.
   Polish-German relations in the region have been strained since
the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939, and Warsaw authorities
apparently feared a visit by Kohl, who arrived in the country today
for a five-day visit, would stir ethnic tensions.
   More than one-third of present-day Poland was formerly German
territory, and millions of Germans were expelled after the regions
were awarded to Poland after the war.
   An alternate site for Kohl to meet ethnic Germans was found at
Krzyzowa, known as Kreisau in German, a town where opponents of
Hitler met to map out resistance plans.
   Some of the Kreisau Circle members were later involved in the
abortive July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler at an East Prussian
bunker now located in northern Poland.
   Ethnic Germans blamed the Polish government for conflict over a
visit to Gora Sw. Anny and say they plan to make a strong showing
by organizing buses for the open-air Mass at Krzyzowa.
   About 500 people who attended Mass in German on Sunday were
urged by the priest, a Franciscan friar, to go to Krzyzowa and then
provided with detailed instructions on how to get there.
   ``The Poles are afraid of us. We don't want to hurt the Poles
but we want to feel German,'' said Richard Urban, one of the
leaders of the German Friendship Circle. The group maintains close
links with groups of Silesians in West Germany.
   As long as they can prove German heritage, ethnic Germans in
Poland can automatically receive West German citizenship if they
decide to emigrate. But the Germans at Gora Sw. Anny said they want
to remain in Poland.
   ``We want to stay here. We have been here for 600 years. This is
our homeland,'' said Urban. But he added: ``We want our children to
learn German and we want our own schools and churches.''
   All prayer books and guides sold at the monastery are in Polish.
But down near the parking lot, one elderly German-speaker did a
brisk business selling copies of the day's service and hymns in
German for about 65 cents.
   Like many other social and ethnic groups, the German minority
was forbidden to form independent associations under the previous
Communist government. That leadership has been replaced with a
Solidarity-led government.
   Ethnic Germans benefited from a law passed earlier this year
allowing the official registration of independent groups. At least
two associations for the promotion of German culture have been
formed.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who's talked freely and
for free while in office, has lined up another paying position to
offer his words.
   On Wednesday, he signed with WCBS-TV as a local commentator and
weekly news show host. Besides the new TV gigs, Koch already has
agreed to do a morning radio spot, lecture on urban affairs at New
York University and undertake a national speaking tour.
   ``Throughout his career, Ed Koch has never been at a loss for
words,'' said Roger Coloff, WCBS' president-general manager. ``In
this new role ... he will continue to speak out about issues of
interest to our viewers.''
   He'll do a Sunday morning news program and regular commentary on
the station's 5 p.m. weekday newscasts, Coloff said.
   Koch is slated to make his debut the week of Jan. 8, one week
after he leaves Gracie Mansion. Details of the mayor's contract
were not announced, but Koch observed recently that hearing him
speak once he leaves City Hall will no longer be free.

<TEXT>
   Middle school students near the town
where an 11-year-old boy was abducted last month are sending
letters to students around the country asking for help in finding
him.
   ``If somebody would see it, and they might see Jacob...'' said
11-year-old David Brinkman. ``They might be able to alert
somebody,'' added Cary Gottwald, 13.
   Paynesville is 30 miles southwest of St. Jospeh, the town of
3,000 people where Jacob Wetterling was kidnapped Oct. 22 while
riding bikes with two friends.
   Paynesville Middle School Principal Mike Lund said some children
are afraid to go outside alone and others have told of nightmares.
   ``We had a lot of our middle school students really concerned
much more than expected. We were surprised by how affected they
were,'' Lund said.
   On Monday and Tuesday, students made white yarn bracelets that
they will distribute to remind people to look for Jacob. The
children gethered in the gym Wednesday and formed circles, held
hands, and listened to a girls' choir sing ``Somewhere Out There.''
   Many of the children tied white ribbons around their ankles, or
wore white clothing. Some carried signs or wore T-shirts saying
``Jacob's Hope.''
   ``I think it helps get rid of some of that tension and fear,''
Lund said. ``I think it helps them feel they are doing something
positive for Jacob.''
   Each of the 430 fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth graders at the
school wrote a letter to a middle school somewhere in the nation.
   The main body of each letter was already typed. Students filled
in information about themselves and included pictures of Jacob and
of a van that may be involved in the abduction.
   ``We are concerned that as each day goes by, Jacob's abductor
may be taking him further and further from his home,'' the letter
says. ``Each of the students in our school is trying to help out by
sending these flyers to schools in other areas of the United
States.''

<HEAD>Report: Deng Retires from Powerful Military Commission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping has
resigned as chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission,
his top remaining formal leadership post, a semi-official news
agency reported Thursday.
   Deng was replaced by his latest protege, Communist Party chief
Jiang Zemin, in a personnel switch approved Thursday by a party
Central Committee meeting in Beijing, the Hong Kong China News
Agency said.
   Deng, 85, has been seeking to retire from all his top positions
to make way for a new generation of leaders centered around Jiang.
   President Yang Shangkun, who reportedly had sought the
chairmanship over Deng's objections, was named first vice chairman
of the commission, the report said.
   Deng is expected to remain China's paramount leader even after
stepping down from the commission because of his stature as
architect of Chinese policy over the past decade and his
connections.
   Diplomatic sources in Beijing have said there was a power
struggle in the party hierarchy centering on the military
commission, which sets policy for the armed forces.
   Yang, who had been permanent vice chairman of the commission,
reportedly sought to solidify his place in the post-Deng era by
winning the position. But other senior party members felt the post
should be automatically assigned to the party general secretary.
   Jiang, 62, was named party chief June 24 after Zhao Ziyang was
purged from the post for his tolerance of the pro-democracy
movement, which the military crushed on June 4, killing hundreds of
unarmed civilians in central Beijing.
   Deng has named Jiang, who lacks a national power base, to lead
the country as head of the next generation of Chinese leaders.
   The news agency report, which could not be independently
confirmed immediately, said Liu Huaqing, formerly deputy secretary
general of the commission, was named the other vice chairman of the
commission.
   Yang Baibing, the political boss of the People's Liberation Army
and Yang Shangkun's younger brother, was named secretary-general of
the commission, the news agency said.
   Deng was purged twice by radicals during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, then staged a comeback that turned China around. He
transformed a country dominated by ideological battles into one
with pragmatic, market-oriented economic policies.
   Living standards have improved for millions of Chinese but the
modernization drive led to serious problems of inflation and
corruption.
   The Communist leadership is now seeking to remedy those
problems, with the Central Committee expected to approve an
economic austerity program during its current session.
   Deng wears a hearing aid and smokes heavily but is not known to
have any serious health problem.

<HEAD>Officials Investigate Radioactive Leak at Ohio Nuke Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMISBURG, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An accident during an experiment at a
plant that produces nuclear detonators caused its heaviest
discharge of tritium gas in at least 20 years and contaminated four
workers, officials said.
   No evacuations were necessary.
   About 3.7 grams of radioactive tritium was released Wednesday at
the Mound Nuclear Production Plant, 10 miles southwest of Dayton.
   The accident released about 10 times the gas normally discharged
from the government-run plant each year and was the largest at the
plant since the 1960s, said safety director Richard Neff. But he
characterized it as a minor leak.
   ``We don't believe we had a significant amount that went up,''
Neff said.
   The plant produces detonators for nuclear bombs and propulsion
systems for space vehicles.
   Plant officials initially estimated that no more than a few
dozen residents could have been exposed to a maximum of 12
millirems of tritium, the equivalent of one chest X-ray.
   But plant spokesman Howard Charbeneau later said the maximum
off-site dosage was 0.051 millirem. A person taking a plane across
the country would be exposed to 3 millirems, he said.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's standard of safe
dosage is 25 millirems a year.
   The accident occurred when a quartz window in a bell jar
containing tritium shattered. The tritium, a radioactive isotope of
hydrogen, was vented into an exhaust stack.
   Plant workers had been engaged in a measurement process in which
a laser beam is passed through the quartz to aid the movement of
tritium, Charbeneau said.
   He would not comment on the purpose of the experiment, but said,
``We've done that before. It's not a new process.''
   Neff said the Energy Department, the Ohio Emergency Management
Association and the city of Miamisburg were notified.
   Neff said four of the 52 workers in the building where the
accident occurred tested positive for tritium. The levels were
relatively low, he said, but the exact dosage won't be known until
further testing.
   Neff said tritium was ``relatively low-risk compared to most
radioactive materials.''
   About 2,200 workers are employed at the plant, which is operated
for the Energy Department by EG&amp;G Mound Applied Technologies.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index gained
slightly after nervous ups and downs today, while the dollar fell
against the Japanese yen for the second consecutive day.
   The dollar closed at 142.70 yen, down 0.27 yen from Wednesday's
close of 142.97 yen. It opened at 143.33 yen and ranged between
142.67 yen and 143.33 yen. The dollar fell by 0.66 yen on Wednesday.
   On Thursday, it was falling on news that U.S. banks had cut
their prime lending rate, currency traders said. Lower interest
rates tend to make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
   ``Despite the narrowing interest rate gap between Japan and the
United States, the dollar has been bullish because of persistent
demand among Japanese investors,'' said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a Daiwa
Bank trader.
   ``That's mainly because investors have been buying the U.S.
money prior to the auction of U.S. Treasury securities,'' he said.
   An estimated $6.71 billion changed hands today, down from
Wednesday's $7.76 billion.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
61.83 points, or 0.17 percent, closing at 35,657.42.
   The index fell in the morning and slipped further in the early
afternoon as investors, including Solomon Brothers, sold spot
issues for technical adjustments, said Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer
with New Japan Securities Co.
   The Nikkei rose back when investors started to pick up issues
whose prices had fallen, he said.
   Buying from foreign securities firms, mainly Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley, for option trading also boosted the index, Nomura
said. Today was the last day for November options.
   ``But today's major players were securities dealers, who tend to
buy and sell back issues frequently according to the fluctuation in
the index,'' Nomura said.
   ``That's why the Nikkei went up and down so nervously,'' he said.
   Trading was fairly active, with first section volume estimated
at 800 million shares, unchanged from the previous day.
   Among gainers were shipbuilding, electric power plant and steel
issues.

   President Bush's special envoy to Vietnam is
being allowed to have surplus medical equipment from the Veterans
Department for use in Vietnam.
   Don Smith, a Veterans Department spokesman, said Wednesday night
that all equipment turned over to retired Army Gen. John Vessey was
first offered to installations throughout the Veterans Department
system and to other government agencies.
   Two years ago, the United States agreed to ease the way for
private groups with medical expertise to help Vietnamese war
victims.
   That agreement was in return for Hanoi's help on resolving the
question of what happened to missing U.S. servicemen and recovering
remains of those killed in the war. There are 2,331 U.S. servicemen
unaccounted for, according to the Defense Department.
   ``If this can help Gen. Vessey make progress on the MIA issue, I
can't imagine the most hard-bitten Vietnam Veteran having a problem

<HEAD>Computer Chip Industry Executive Raps Foreign Competitors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is being warned that the U.S.
semiconductor industry is falling prey to foreign competitors
determined to gain a choke hold on the materials and equipment
needed to make computer chips.
   Robert Noyes, chief executive officer of Sematech, said
Wednesday that foreign competitors are ``determined to control the
supply lines, the manufacturing and the end products.'' He did not
name specific competitors.
   Noyes told a joint hearing of two House Science subcommittees
that while the United States has a 40 percent share of the
worldwide semiconductor market, its hold on the markets for
critical equipment and materials is below that.
   Sematech is a government-supported consortium of 14 companies,
established two years ago to help the U.S. computer chip industry
compete in the world market. Congress gave Sematech $100 million in
each of the last two years, and committees in both houses have
recommended paying the same amount for 1990.

   Rehnquist's letter did not offer any explanation for the
justices' decision, nor did it specify which members opposed

Robert H. Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court. His nomination
was rejected by the Senate.

<HEAD>Former Nuclear Executive Tapped for Key Waste Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will nominate John Bartlett, a
former executive of a Massachusetts-based government contractor, to
manage the Energy Department's high-level nuclear waste program,
congressional and other sources said.
   The selection comes amid growing criticism on Capitol Hill of
delays in the department's efforts to build a permanent dump for
radioactive waste from nuclear power plants.
   Bush is expected to nominate Bartlett for the waste job later
this month, the sources said Wednesday, speaking on condition they
not be identified. If confirmed, Bartlett would fill a void in the
waste program that has plagued the Energy Department for two years.
   The current head of the waste management office, Sam Rousso,
holds the job on an interim basis.
   Bartlett would become a central figure in the federal
government's bitter struggle with Nevada over efforts to build the
nation's first permanent dump for high-level nuclear waste.
   Nevada Gov. Bob Miller has blocked the department's efforts to
begin studying Yucca Mountain, about 100 miles northwest of Las
Vegas, as the only candidate site for the proposed underground
dump. The standoff, with other problems, is expected to force
Watkins to announce a further delay in the target date for opening
a permanent waste dump. The current target date is 2003.
   Watkins is drawing increasing criticism on Capitol Hill for his
failure to break the waste impasse.
   In a letter released earlier this week, four influential House
members told Watkins they were ``appalled'' the waste management
office has been without a director for two years and that Watkins
appeared to be planning major changes in the waste program without
consulting Congress.
   The letter, dated Oct. 17, was signed by Reps. John D. Dingell,
D-Mich.; Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz.; James V. Hansen, R-Utah; and
Philip R. Sharp, D-Ind.
   Sources who declined to be identified said Watkins has decided
to bring Bartlett into the department as a special adviser until
routine FBI background checks are completed and he is confirmed by
the Senate.
   Both the White House and the department declined to confirm the
Bartlett selection, saying there would be no comment until a
nominee was announced.
   The company at which Bartlett had worked for the last decade,
The Analytic Sciences Corp. is an engineering contractor to various
government agencies, including the Energy Department. Bartlett was
manager of the company's office of nuclear engineering until he
quit earlier this fall, company officials said.
   The company declined to specify the work it had performed for
the Energy Department. Available department records list five
contracts _ all expired _ with Bartlett's former employer, but they
include no description of the work done.
   The total value of the contracts was $2.2 million. The most
recent one, valued at $491,840, was retired June 30, according to
the department records.
   Jim Kelly, director of business development at the Reading,
Mass.-based company, said in a telephone interview Wednesday he
could not comment on Bartlett's work there beyond confirming that
he had quit and that ``he did a good job for us.''
   Efforts to reach Bartlett this week were unsuccessful. In a
telephone interview last month, Bartlett said he had discussed the
waste job with Watkins and White House officials but that he had
been given no firm commitments.

<HEAD>Female Gang Member May Have Forced 11-year-old Into Rape Initiation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old girl who was repeatedly
raped as part of a gang's initiation may have been forced into the
ordeal by a friend, a 17-year-old female member of the gang, police
said.
   Five members of the Gangster Disciples were charged Wednesday
with raping the girl Saturday night, but Jefferson County Sheriff's
Deputy Charles Buchannon said as many as 10 or 20 young men may
have been involved.
   The young men apparently considered the rapes to be a rite of
initiation for the girl, making her their ``queen,'' said Deputy
Tony Pippen. ``Queen'' describes a girl who has been initiated by
having sex with all of a gang's members, he said.
   Gang members usually try to entice a girl, normally someone they
know, into participating willingly in the initiation, Pippen said.
In this case, he said, the girl apparently did not participate
willingly but was too afraid to resist.
   The incident started while the girl was staying at the home of
her 17-year-old friend, a gang member, police said. They said the
older girl tried to talk her friend into going outside for a walk.
   ``The girl didn't want to, but her friend dragged her out, even
though she knew what was waiting for that little girl,'' Buchannon
said. The girl was taken by her older friend and the gang members
to a park where the rapes took place, he said.
   ``The gang members let the girl go when they started worrying
about whether they'd get caught,'' Buchannon said. At least one of
the boys threatened to kill her if she told anyone, he said.
   The girl returned to her friend's house after the rape and did
not call authorities or her parents, Buchannon said.
   Residents who heard about the rape flagged down Pippen and his
partner during their patrol Sunday and told them about it. The
deputies found the girl still at her friend's house and questioned
her. The five gang members were arrested later Sunday.
   Antonio Jones, 18, was charged as an adult and the four others
were charged with being juvenile deliquents accused of rape,
Buchannon said. Three are 17 and one is 14.
   He said that to his knowledge, none of the five, all students at
Brighton High School, had been in trouble before. He described them
as being from middle-class families.

<HEAD>Judge Bans Testimony on Victim's Record in Miami Riot Shooting Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has banned testimony about the victim's
criminal record in the case of a Miami officer who shot and killed
a black motorcyclist, sparking three days of racial disturbances.
   Dade County Judge Joseph Farina ruled Wednesday that Clement
Lloyd's previous drug convictions, and defense contentions that he
was collecting drug proceeds the day of his death, were irrelevant
to the case.
   Roy Black, an attorney for suspended Miami officer William
Lozano, said the ruling hurt his effort to defend the 30-year-old
policeman against manslaughter charges. The defense wanted to show
Lloyd was desperate and drugged enough to try to run over Lozano.
   ``He's excluded our entire defense,'' Black said. ``Lloyd was a
drug dealer out collecting his profits; he didn't want to be
stopped.''
   Farina did allow evidence that Lloyd, 23, had 5.5 grams of
marijuana and $1,500 dollars in cash on him at the time of the
shooting. In his blood, Lloyd had alcohol and high levels of THC,
the active ingredient in marijuana _ evidence which also can be
introduced in court.
   The judge banned any mention of similar evidence concerning
Allan Blanchard, 24, Lloyd's passenger, who died when the motorcyle
crashed after the shooting.
   Lozano faces two manslaughter counts in the deaths.
   During the hearing, prosecutors told the judge the defense
should not be allowed to put Lloyd and Blanchard, both black, on
trial instead of Lozano.
   Lead prosecutor John Hogan remained cautious about his victory
in pretrial motions. ``We're happy with some of them, unhappy with
others,'' Hogan said. ``But obviously we won some motions that were
important to us.''
   Farina allowed the prosecution to use testimony about Miami city
police regulations to prove Lozano acted negligently and
unprofessionally when he shot and killed Lloyd on Jan. 16.
   Those regulations are much more restrictive than Florida's
``fleeing felon'' law, which the defense argued should be the
standard to judge the officer.
   Lozano fired one shot, hitting Lloyd in the head and killing
him, as the motorcyclist sped away from another officer. Lozano
contends the motorcycle was heading straight at him. Prosecutors
say Miami police policy dictated that he should get out of the way,
and should not have fired at a moving vehicle.
   In the riot that followed the shooting, one person was killed,
11 were wounded by gunfire and 13 buildings were burned down in
predominantly black neighborhoods.
   The defense on Wednesday also sought to introduce statements
contending the prosecution was racially and politically motivated,
and that some prosecutors had privately acknowledged that. But the
judge denied that testimony.

<HEAD>Retail Center With Marcos Ties Sold at Auction for $25 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Manhattan shopping mall that attracted
interest from U.S. and Filipino prosecutors for its ties to former
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos drew only one bidder at a
foreclosure auction.
   Real estate developer Morris Bailey led a group of investors who
bought Herald Center, a 10-story vertical mall across the street
from Macy's flagship store, for the minimum bid of $25 million
Wednesday.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, allegedly bought the mall and three
other Manhattan properties with money looted from their homeland's
treasury.
   Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in September, leaving his wife to
face numerous lawsuits in the United States and Philippines,
including a criminal indictment.
   The court-appointed special master of the auction, Stephen
Estroff, said he was disappointed that more bidders did not come
forward.
   ``Retailing in Manhattan is undergoing stress,'' Estroff said.
   Herald Center has suffered from poor business in recent years,
with retail and restaurant outlets dropping from a high of 70 to
the current 45 tenants.
   But Bailey was optimistic about its future.
   ``Herald Center is the premier retail location in the country
today,'' he said. ``If properly directed, we are going to have some
good response.''
   Bailey said his group would announce its plans for the center
soon.
   The auction of Herald Center was part of a foreclosure action by
the property's mortgage holder, Security Pacific Mortgage and Real
Services. Money from the sale will go toward a $58.65 million
foreclosure judgment awarded Security Pacific by U.S. District
Judge Pierre Leval.
   Leval, who presides over one of the Philippine lawsuits, allowed
the sale of three of the buildings and said any proceeds left over
would be held by the court pending the outcome of the litigation.
   One of the other buildings, 40 Wall St., was sold for $108.6
million at auction in August but the sale collapsed when the buyers
failed raise the money by the Oct. 10 closing date. That building
will be re-auctioned Monday.
   An auction date has not been set yet for a third property.
Foreclosure proceedings are under way for the fourth property and a
sale is expected soon.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Attack Claims That Drug Defendant Tied to Zia Plot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man whose defense hinges on his
claim of involvement in a plot to kill Pakistan's former leader is
an internationally known heroin dealer trying to avoid prison,
prosecutors said.
   ``You would create any sort of story. You would say anything,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin O'Regan said Wednesday as he began
cross-examining Mushtaq Malik.
   The 41-year-old defendant has testified that his involvement
with an accused drug dealer was merely an effort to track down a
man who double-crossed him in a plot kill Pakistani President Gen.
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq. The plot, Malik has said, was orchestrated by
officials in the Pakistan People's Party, whose current leader is
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   Zia died in a mysterious plane crash Aug. 17, 1988. A Pakistani
official has denied the assassination plot.
   O'Regan reeled off a string of alleged heroin smuggling acts in
which he said Malik was involved, including a ``double-dipping''
scheme with a German official in which Malik dealt heroin and then
tipped off the official to the shipment, thereby reaping the sale
and reward.
   Malik called the allegations baseless.
   The defendant appeared to be at odds with his attorney, Stephen
Ferrarone, frequently telling the defense attorney to sit down when
he tried to raise objections to the prosecutor's cross-examination.
   Malik, who said he's of royal blood and known as ``The Black
Prince'' in Pakistan, has stopped short of saying he was involved
in the plane crash that killed Zia.
   Bashir Riaz, an adviser to Bhutto, has told The Associated Press
that Malik's claim of an assassination plot was ``another attempt
by the drug mafia to discredit the government because of Benazir
Bhutto's campaign against the drug trade.''
   Pakistani officials, including those who served Zia, at first
blamed the plane crash on Soviet and Afghan agents operating
against Pakistan and the United States for their support of Afghan
Mujahedeen. After Bhutto came to power, Zia's son, Ejaz ul-Haq, and
some opposition right-wingers blamed her ruling Pakistan People's
Party.
   Malik in early 1985 was convicted in Pakistan and served more
than two years in prison for heroin trafficking. He said those
charges were politically motivated.

<HEAD>Hugo May Be to Blame for Death of Rare Wolf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stress or injury from Hurricane Hugo
probably contributed to the death of the sole male red wolf in a
wildlife refuge, but four pups of the endangered species appear
healthy, the refuge manager said.
   The 7-year-old wolf had been released on Bulls Island, part of
the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge on the Atlantic coast,
with a female adult in an attempt to reintroduce the species, which
had become extinct in the wild.
   The male adult's carcass was discovered Saturday, about three
weeks after the animal died, said George R. Garris, the refuge
manager.
   ``We're not sure of the cause,'' Garris said. ``He probably
sustained injury during Hugo or the stress was too much for him.''
   The carcass was not found earlier because trees felled by Hugo
on Sept. 21 blocked island roads until last week. The hurricane,
with 135 mph winds, came ashore at Charleston, about 20 miles
southwest of Bulls Island.
   The four 6-month-old female pups appear healthy, and could be
transferred to Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in North
Carolina within several months, once they learn hunting techniques,
Garris said. A Cape Romain employee is tracking them and giving
them food.
   Born in a zoo, the male adult and a female adult were released
on Bulls Island in 1987. An alligator killed the female less than a
year later and the male raised their two male pups. The pups later
were transferred to the North Carolina refuge, where they still
live.
   A second female wolf was introduced on Bulls Island last winter.
The pair produced five female offspring in the spring. Days later,
an alligator killed the mother, and one pup later was killed by
another alligator.
   The red wolf once ranged from Texas east to the Atlantic coast
and north to the Ohio Valley, but began disappearing because of
their inability to adapt to changes in the land and predator
control.
   In 1973, after the passage of the Endangered Species Act, the
entire red wolf population in southeast Texas and Louisiana was
captured to prevent its extinction.
   The red wolf is smaller than the grey wolf, with females
weighing 40-60 pounds and males weighing 60-80 pounds.
   The black-footed ferret is the only mammal that is rarer than
the red wolf in the United States.

   What a blast! Sheriff's deputies attacked
the drug problem by blowing up mounds of dirt before marijuana
could be replanted in them.
   There was no pot planted Tuesday when bomb experts rigged 20
charges, one for each hand-rigged mound erected on a swamp about 10
miles east of the city. But Dave Bristow, a spokesman with the
Manatee Sheriff's Office, explained on Wednesday:
   ``We've had an ongoing problem at this location. We'd spot the
pot, eradicate it and a few months later we'd go back and the
mounds were replanted.
   ``So we came up with the idea of using explosives to get rid of
the mounds to discourage people from replanting. Now they can't.''
   Bristow said the method was inexpensive, quick and effective.

   At 46, the baddest boy of rock 'n' roll is also
the father of four, ages 4-19.
   ``I get on fine with my kids,'' said Mick Jagger. ``I mean, when
I tell them the dangers of drugs or sex, at least they know that I
know what I'm talking about.''
   Sometimes the father instinct reacts first, like last year when
18-year-old daughter Jade (by ex-wife Bianca) was expelled from
private school for a late-night rendezvous with her boyfriend, who
was later arrested on drug conspiracy charges.
   ``I was a little shocked for a moment,'' Jagger said in an
interview in this week's US magazine.
   ``I just let it run its course and tried to be as fair-handed as
I could be,'' he said. ``Jade had her rebellious moment, which was
pretty quiet compared to mine, which lasted about 15 years!''
   What's post-rebellion life like? ``I do a lot of boring
exercises and I lay off the goodies,'' said Jagger. ``We behave _
we have to at our age.''
   Jagger got a $3 million advance to write his autobiography, the
magazine said. But it seems an unlikely proposition.
   ``I can't remember what happened,'' the Rolling Stone's lead
singer said.

<HEAD>Group Urges Hepatitis Vaccine for Babies of Southeast Asia Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Babies born to refugees from Southeast Asia are at
high risk of catching hepatitis B and should be routinely
vaccinated against the dangerous virus, U.S. health officials
recommended today.
   Long-time carriers of the virus have an increased risk of liver
cancer and chronic liver disease. The younger people are when they
catch the hepatitis virus, the more likely they are to die of these
diseases.
   Since 1975, nearly 1 million people have moved to the United
States from Southeast Asia, where infection with the hepatitis B
virus is extremely common.
   In today's study, doctors from the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control found that the children of Southeast Asian immigrants have
a substantial risk of catching the virus, even if they are free of
it at birth.
   The research, directed by Dr. Adele L. Franks, was published in
the New England Journal of Medicine. It was based on 196 refugee
families with 257 children who were born in the United States.
   The virus is frequently passed from mother to child before
birth. In the families studied, 55 percent of the children born to
mothers with infectious disease had the infection. However, 7
percent of the children whose mothers were free of the infection
also had the virus.
   The researchers concluded that child-to-child transmission was
responsible for at least some of the hepatitis B infections.
   Under current guidelines, vaccination is recommended only for
newborns of mothers with infectious disease. The researcher said
this should be expanded to include all newborn children of refugees
from Southeast Asia.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Jay H. Hoofnagle of the
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
agreed with the proposal.
   ``This advice is sound,'' he wrote, ``and if followed, will
contibute materially to the good health of the children of these
first-generation Americans.''

<HEAD>Study: Breast Cancer Linked with X-rays During Infancy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exposure to radiation even during infancy can
significantly increase women's risk of breast cancer when they
reach adulthood, a study published today confirms.
   The research was based on a long-term follow-up of women who
were given X-ray therapy shortly after birth for treatment of
enlarged thymus glands. Such treatment was common until the late
1950s, when doctors realized that seemingly enlarged thymuses were
actually normal.
   By age 36, the study found that those who had received the
treatment were nearly four times more likely to get breast cancer
than were sisters who did not receive the radiation.
   The researchers said their work ``suggests that irradiation of
the female breast at a very early age can have harmful effects that
do not appear until many years later.''
   Experts have long recognized that breast tissue is extremely
sensitive to the damaging effects of radiation. Until recently,
they believed that only those who received radiation during
adolescence or adulthood would be harmed. However, recent follow-up
of Japanese girls exposed to radiation from atomic bombs during
World War II found they also had an increased risk of breast cancer
later in life.
   The latest study, directed by Dr. Nancy G. Hildreth of the
University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, was
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   The doctors followed 1,201 women who received X-ray treatment
for enlarged thymuses and 2,469 of their sisters who did not get
radiation. There were 22 cases of breast cancer among the radiation
group and 12 among the sisters.
   Another study in the journal, conducted by Dr. Anthony B. Miller
of the National Cancer Institute of Canada, followed 31,710 who
received repeated diagnostic X-rays for tuberculosis.
   This study found the greatest risk of breast cancer among those
who got the X-rays between ages 10 and 14. The risk fell with
increasing age.

<HEAD>Predictions of Conversion Rate Trigger Panic Selling of Dollars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poles rushed to sell hoarded dollars after
officials predicted the Polish zloty could be convertible by year's
end, sending the U.S. currency into a tailspin on the unofficial
market.
   The dollar has lost nearly 30 percent of its value in legal
private trading over the past week and has dropped by 50 percent
over the past month.
   On Wednesday, banks and commercial traders were paying between
4,800 and 5,000 zlotys per dollar _ down from more than 10,000 in
early October and from 6,300 on Monday.
   Dollar dumping has accelerated with predictions that the
commercial rate will soon be brought into line with the official
rate for foreign business transactions, now at 2,800 zlotys per
dollar.
   Panic selling ensued after the pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta
Wyborcza reported the discussion at a Monday Cabinet meeting of
fixing a uniform conversion rate of 3,500 zlotys to the dollar by
year's end.
   Officials contend the dramatic fall of the dollar on what used
to be the black market could be a step toward stabilizing the
Polish monetary system and encouraging farmers to put up more of
their produce for sale.
   But millions of Poles who amass dollars to control their buying
power in times of spiraling inflation are seeing their personal
wealth devasted.
   ``I have to buy a car, so I am forced to sell my dollars,'' said
Jerzy Oblencki, an engineer among more than 100 people lined up at
a National Bank of Poland office in central Warsaw early Wednesday.
   Like many Poles saving for expensive items, Oblencki had been
buying dollars on the commercial market for months, assuming the
dollars would hold their value better than the troubled zlotys.
   Inflation, currently estimated at over 600 percent annually, has
undermined public confidence in the Polish currency.
   The selling rush of the past few days has overwhelmed private
traders, who have run out of zlotys and have been forced to suspend
buying dollars.
   ``If I had zlotys to sell I could buy $100,000 to $200,000 just
today,'' said Wojciech Kujawa, director of a currency exchange on
bustling Pulawska Street. Kujawa is one of dozens of private
traders operating in Warsaw.
   In a transition to a more market-oriented economy, the
government in January gave official sanction to private
money-trading in hopes of luring dollars from people reluctant to
put their money in the bank.
   The private traders determine conversion rates based on the
daily demand from government and industry for hard currency to
purchase goods abroad.
   ``Even the wisest man cannot foresee what will happen in Poland,
or whether the dollar will go up or down,'' said Jozef Daczewski, a
department head of the Polish State Savings Bank.
   The true value of the dollar in Poland at present is between
6,000 and 7,000 zlotys, according to Ewa Kawecka-Wlodarczak, the
bank's foreign exchange manager. Her calculation was reported in
Wednesday's edition of the government newspaper Rzeczpospolita.
   Uncertainty in the fledgling money market has forced those
saving for big purchases to gamble on when to trade in their hard
currency.
   ``Some people are panicking because they want to buy their
apartments before Jan. 1, when the price per square meter is
expected to go up,'' Marian Socha explained as he waited in line at
the bank.
   Dozens of other Poles who crowded around to add their thoughts
on the money situation said that without sufficient goods and
produce on the market to soak up the zlotys, the dollar's tumble is
artificial and will soon correct itself.
   Tomasz Sikorski, an agricultural specialist, said farmers are
holding back grain in hopes of being able to sell it later when
prices and the value of the zloty are more stable.
   Economists are hoping that Western aid expected to arrive over
the next few weeks will boost food supplies, stabilize prices and
engender public confidence in the zloty.

   Tornadoes and torrential rain swept through the Deep South,
damaging buildings and causing floods and at least two deaths,
including a 3-year-old who was thrown 200 yards by a twister that
blasted his family's mobile home.
   Tornadoes touched down Wednesday evening in Georgia, Alabama and
Mississippi, and rains continued in already flooded parts of
Louisiana,
   ``If there was a Richter scale for floods, this would have
topped it,'' said Mike Yenni, president of Jefferson Parish, La. A
2-year-old boy there died when he fell into a drainage canal
earlier this week.
   The 3-year-old and his parents were in a mobile home smashed by
a tornado in Pineview, Ga., a town of 560 people.
   ``The child was found under a car 200 yards from the foundation
of the trailer,'' said Deputy Sheriff Dianne Roberts. ``Someone
just happened to look under it and saw the baby.'' The child's name
was unavailable.
   His father, Billy West, was found lying in the road with a
broken neck and was in critical condition early today, said Mandy
Shackleford, a spokeswoman at the Medical Center of Central Georgia
in Macon. The mother also was hurt.
   The tornado damaged at least four other homes and caused three
additional injuries, authorities said.
   A tornado touched down near Stonewall, Miss., on Wednesday
night, the National Weather Service said, but no details were
available.
   Two tornadoes hit two counties in southeast Alabama on Wednesday
morning.
   In Geneva County, a woman was hurt when her mobile home was
tossed into a fish pond. Her husband paddled to the trailer in his
boat to retrieve his wife and their daughter.
   ``It just all happened so fast,'' Mrs. E.C. Barnes, 54, said in
a telephone interview from her hospital bed. ``The trailer is still
intact. It got picked up and was dropped in the pond. I'm fine,
though.''
   A tornado damaged more than 40 homes and businesses in the town
of Dothan.
   ``This is the worst tornado I've seen in Houston County in 10
years,'' said Pat Bradley of the Dothan-Houston County Emergency
Management Agency. ``We've found some roofs that were taken seven
blocks away and dropped.''
   The Red Cross opened a shelter for those left homeless or
without power because of the storms.
   About 2,000 students at Wallace College were kept in hallways
for an hour during the worst of the storms and then were sent home.
Several found their cars floating in a flooded parking lot.
   The weather service on Wednesday reported 5.6 inches of rain in
Mobile, 9.6 inches in Dothan, and nearly 10 inches in Florala.
   More than 2,200 homes and businesses flooded after a record 17
inches of rain drenched New Orleans and three surrounding parishes
during a 24-hour period that ended Tuesday night, according to
preliminary estimates. The rains continued in some areas Wednesday.
   Of the 1,400 homes in the Ormond Estates subdivision, 20 miles
up the Mississippi River from New Orleans, 1,000 were flooded.
Water was up to 2 feet deep in homes that cost from $100,000 to
$500,000. Another 1,000 homes flooded in Gretna, Kenner and parts
of Jefferson Parish.
   Yenni said he would call for passage of a $100 million plan for
major canal improvements and two more pumping stations in the New
Orleans area, which is below sea level and relies on a network of
drainage canals and pumps to protect neighborhoods from flooding.
   ``I cannot believe this. I think I'm going to be sick. Brand new
carpet ruined, everything ruined,'' said Liz Arceneaux, who
returned to her Ormond Estates house by boat to find 5 inches of
water standing in the home.

<HEAD>Hindus Break Ground For Temple At Disputed Site</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   AYODHYA, India AP) _ Tens of thousands of militant Hindus stood
guard today with tridents and bows and arrows as priests broke
ground for a temple at a religious site claimed by both Hindus and
Moslems.
   More than 1,000 Hindu pilgrims stood solemnly as four
consecrated bricks passed over their heads and were placed on the
ground as a symbol of the foundation they say they will begin
digging Friday.
   Hundreds of security troops surrounded the disputed shrine,
watched from rooftops and lined the roads leading to Ayodhya, a
town of 35,000 people some 325 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   The massive police and paramilitary presence indicated the
lengths the government has taken to prevent violence between
members of the two faiths.
   At least 290 people, mostly Moslems, have been killed in
religious riots across other parts of India because of plans to
build the temple.
   If ever completed, the temple would engulf a disputed 17th
century shrine claimed by followers of both religions.
   Moslems, who comprise 11 percent of India's 880 million people,
say the shrine is the Babri Masjid, or mosque of the Moghal emperor
Babar.
   Hindus, who comprise 82 percent of the population, claim the
mosque was built over the birthplace of the Lord Ram, an
incarnation of Vishnu, one of the supreme trinity of gods.
   The dispute over the squat, white buildings with three domes
dates back to the 19th century but erupted afresh in August after
the militant Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Conference of Hindus,
announced plans to build a new temple.
   The ceremony prompted the government to put police and the army
on a state of alert across northern India. Additional forces were
patrolling cities with significant Moslem populations, including
New Delhi, Home Ministry officials said on condition of anonymity.
   The issue also has become a focal point for India's general
elections, scheduled for Nov. 22, 24 and 26.
   Asked if construction would begin before the elections, Surya
Krishna, joint secretary of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, replied:
``Within a month.''
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who faces a strong challenge for
re-election from an opposition coalition, is unwilling to risk
alienating the majority Hindus. He is equally unwilling to risk the
minority Moslem votes, which traditionally have gone in favor of
his Congress Party.
   Vishwanah Pratap Singh, leader of the opposition coalition, has
also avoided taking sides on the dispute.
   Both have urged moderation and tolerance by members of both
faiths, without giving any specific suggestions on how to resolve
the problem.
   Singh had planned to be in Ayodhya on today to try to keep
tensions from boiling into violence. However, he remained in the
town of Faizabad, about four miles away.
   Asked why, he replied, ``This is part of Ayodhya.''

   Kitty Dukakis, struggling against alcoholism, was
hospitalized for severe reactions to rubbing alcohol, which she
drank while exhausted because of flu and depression, her doctor
said.
   The wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis had been taking
anti-depressants prescribed by her psychiatrist, but tests showed
the rubbing alcohol caused her hospitalization, said Dr. Gerald
Plotkin, the family physician.
   Some specialists in treating alcoholism characterized Mrs.
Dukakis' action as a ``desperate cry for help.''
   The Dukakis family removed all alcoholic beverages from their
home after Mrs. Dukakis entered a treatment program for alcoholism
last February, said Mindy Lubber, the governor's spokeswoman.
   Plotkin did not comment Wednesday on whether Mrs. Dukakis had
knowingly tried to hurt herself or was seeking the effects of
alcohol when she drank a small amount of the poisonous substance
Monday.
   The former Democratic presidential candidate spent Monday and
Tuesday at his wife's side, canceled all appointments, and refused
to comment.
   Mrs. Dukakis, who turns 53 next month, was taken by ambulance to
the hospital on the eve of the first anniversary of her husband's
presidential defeat.
   ``Autumn has been a particularly bad season for her,'' said
Plotkin. ``Kitty has suffered from chemical dependency and
struggled with depression for many years. These two problems often
are related.''
   She was admitted to the intensive care unit at Brigham and
Women's Hospital complaining of what a spokeswoman said were
``flu-like symptoms.'' On Wednesday, she was moved to a private
room.
   Lubber said Wednesday night she did not know how long Mrs.
Dukakis would be hospitalized.
   Rubbing alcohol is normally about 70 percent isopropyl alcohol,
which is much more toxic than ethanol, or drinking liquor, said
Alan Woolf, director of the Massachusetts Poison Center at
Children's Hospital in Boston.
   Isopropyl alcohol can damage the stomach and about 10 ounces of
it could be lethal, Woolf said.
   It is not uncommon for alcoholics to drink rubbing alcohol if
nothing else is available, but specialists in alcholism treatment
said such behavior was more likely to be seen among impoverished
street alcoholics than affluent drinkers.
   ``Usually it's somebody with a severe alcohol problem,'' said a
woman at the Alcohol Abuse 24-Hour Hotline who declined to give her
name. ``They'll drink anything, even hair spray.''
   Others said Mrs. Dukakis' behavior could hardly be interpreted
simply as an effort to get a drink.
   ``It seems like a desperate cry for help, really,'' said Janice
O'Keefe, director of an alcoholism detoxification program at Andrew
House.
   In February, Mrs. Dukakis entered a Rhode Island alcoholism
treatment center for four weeks of therapy. She previously said she
overcame a 26-year addiction to diet pills.
   In October, Mrs. Dukakis participated in an Outward Bound
rafting and camping expedition in Colorado, ``a great experience
that suggested falsely that this fall might not be so bad,''
Plotkin said.
   He said she had been keeping a hectic public speaking schedule
and was exhausted when she returned from Indiana a week ago today.
   Others said Mrs. Dukakis may have stretched her nerves by making
too public a recovery from her problems.
   ``I think it's very difficult to try to manage a recovery in the
public spotlight,'' said Dr. Domenic Ciraulo, substance abuse
consultant at the New England Medical Center in Boston.
   The Dukakises were married in 1963 and have always lived in
suburban Brookline, where they grew up. They have three grown
children and a granddaughter.
   Dukakis' 86-year-old mother, Euterpe, also was hospitalized
Monday. She was in satisfactory condition Wednesday at Beth Israel
Hospital, where she was admitted after a bout of fainting spells.
   Dukakis has faced a difficult season, aggravated by the
dissolution of what had been touted as the state's economic miracle.
   As Dukakis visited his wife Wednesday night, weary legislators
had their hands full, debating cuts into an already lean state
budget to offset a $720 million shortfall.
   His four-year term ends in 1991. He has said he won't seek
re-election.

<HEAD>Oscar-Winner Cleared for Top-Secret Films</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Charlton Heston is in demand by
government producers who value his top-secret nuclear weapons
security clearance as much as his Academy Award.
   For six years Heston has held the nation's highest-level
security clearance because of his no-fee work narrating classified
instructional films and videotapes for the government.
   And the actor who claimed the Oscar for best actor in 1959 for
his work in ``Ben Hur'' knows what possessing the top security
clearance means: Keep quiet.
   ``I'm not trying to be dramatically secretive or anything,''
Heston said. ``But I can't get into that.''
   About 28,000 U.S. Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and defense contractor employees involved in nuclear
weapons programs have the clearance that Heston has, Energy
Department officials said.
   He has worked on at least six highly classified productions,
according to the Energy Department. The latest was a video titled
``Trust but Verify,'' which reportedly showed both Soviet and U.S.
high-tech nuclear weapons.
   Heston, a staunch Republican and former six-term president of
the Screen Actors Guild, says the Energy Department isn't the only
government agency he's worked for, but he won't say what the other
agencies are.
   ``I do work for other agencies from time to time,'' he said.
``Most of the stuff that you do in this area is not designed for
public consumption.''
   The actor's film credits include ``The Ten Commandments,'' ``The
Agony and the Ecstasy,'' and ``Planet of the Apes'' and ``The Three
Musketeers'' series.

<HEAD>Same Storm That Ravaged Thailand Claims At Least 11 Lives in India</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cyclone battered India's southwestern
coast India today, killing at least 11 people and leaving thousands
homeless as it uprooted trees and blew away hundreds of thatched
huts, news reports said.
   United News of India said the storm ravaged the district of
Nellore, 900 miles south of New Delhi.
   The agency quoted unidentified government officials as saying at
least 11 people were killed in the storm. Further details of damage
were not available because it had cut off communication links, it
said.
   The cyclone blew across the Bay of Bengal after killing at least
169 people in Thailand last week as Typhoon Gay. It crossed the
coast at Nellore, a district of 2.2 million people, at 1:30 a.m.
today, UNI said.
   The news agency said trains in the area were halted after strong
winds blew down trees and damaged railroad tracks.
   Press Trust of India, another news agency, said the military had
been alerted for rescue efforts and people were evacuated from the
coastal regions.
   The storm hit Thailand on Friday, and authorities in Bangkok
said at least 111 people were killed on the mainland and another 58
drowned at sea.
   Another 447 people, mostly fishermen out on the Gulf of
Thailand, have been reported missing.
   A cyclone from the Bay of Bengal left at least 150 people dead
across southern and western India in July.
   In 1977, at least 10,000 people were killed in a cyclone in
Andhra Pradesh.

   Rain drenched much of the East Coast today after storms spawned
tornadoes and flooded parts of the Southeast. From the Midwest to
the West Coast, the weather today was expected to be mostly mild
and dry.
   Tornadoes touched down Wednesday evening in Georgia, Alabama and
Mississippi, and rains continued in already flooded parts of
Louisiana. The storm caused two deaths, including a 3-year-old who
was in a mobile home in Pineview, Ga., smashed by a tornado.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to 70 mph at Walnut Grove, Miss., and
to near 60 mph near Bastrop, La.
   A tornado touched down near Stonewall, Miss., on Wednesday
night, the National Weather Service said, but no details were
available.
   Two tornadoes hit two counties in southeast Alabama on Wednesday
morning. In Geneva County, a woman was hurt when her mobile home
was tossed into a fish pond.
   More than 7 inches of rain fell in some areas of southeast
Alabama on Wednesday, while 10 inches fell at Florala, Ala., over
parts of Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Rain today reached much of New England, New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Delaware and parts of the South. Rain over Upper Michigan
changed to snow over eastern Minnesota. Snow was scattered over
western Wyoming and south-central Montana, and rain extended along
the northern Pacific Coast.
   Elsewhere today, skies were expected to be clear.
   Temperatures were unseasonably warm Wednesday in the deep South.
High temperature records for the date were set in Beaumont, Texas,
88 degrees; Corpus Christi, Texas, 93; Lake Charles, La., 87;
Meridian, Miss., 84; Monroe, La., 88; San Antonio, Texas, 90;

   The part-time cleaning woman at the
Parsonsfield Town Hall is going to have to start spending more time
there, now that she's been elected to office.
   Marilee Morrill takes a seat on the town's board of selectmen
today, after defeating two other candidates in Tuesday's election.
   Ms. Morrill only won by four votes of the more than 300 cast,
but no one asked for a recount, so she was sworn in Wednesday.
   Ms. Morrill said she plans on cleaning Town Hall in the future
as well as governing from the place until her term expires in 1991.
So far, no one has publicly expressed any worries about a conflict.

   The dollar was mixed in early European trading
today, and gold was higher.
   Dealers expressed some surprise that the dollar was holding up
despite a quarter-point drop in the U.S. Federal Fund rate and
recent rate hikes in West Germany.
   According to Michael Scheffler, a trader at Bank of America in
Frankfurt, West Germany, the dollar's strength is related to a
fundamental weakness in the Deutsche mark.
   ``Interest rates don't help against psychology, and the
psychology is still directed against the mark,'' Scheffler said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 142.70 yen, down 0.27 yen from
Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar was still trading at 142.70
yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid morning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.8447 West German marks, down from 1.8450
   _1.6173 Swiss francs, up from 1.6170
   _6.2560 French francs, up from 6.2510

   In London, the pound traded at $1.5866, compared with $1.5860
late Wednesday.
   Gold traded at $387.40 at the mid-morning fixing in London, up
from late Wednesday's price of $384.75.
   In Zurich, the noon price was $387.75 per ounce, up from $384.00
late Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped the equivalent of $1.08 an ounce
today, to close at $386.72.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.28 a troy

<HEAD>Star Tribune Guild Gives Lackluster Approval To Six-Year Deal</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Star Tribune newsroom workers averted a
strike by approving a six-year contract, but a union leader called
the new pact a ``rotten deal.''
   The Twin Cities Newspaper Guild approved the pact Wednesday
night, hours after their second strike deadline passed in as many
days. Guild Chairwoman Margaret Zack said the vote was 233-70.
   The contract includes lump-sum bonuses in each of the first
three years, and pay raises of 3.2 percent in the fourth year, 3.1
percent in the fifth year and 3.0 percent in the sixth year, union
officials said.
   Union leaders said they recommended approval because other
unions at the plant were reluctant to support a strike, Many Guild
members feared they would be replaced in a prolonged strike, they
said.
   ``It's a bad deal. It's a rotten deal,'' said Jay Weiner, vice
chair of the workers' negotiating committee.
   ``It simply doesn't meet the needs of people trying to keep
their standard of living intact,'' said Steve Brandt, strike
coordinator for the Minneapolis unit of the Guild.
   John Dennison, vice president of labor relations for the Star
Tribune, said the company succeeded in its goal to freeze wage
scales for three years. But he said the company also ``made an
effort to accommodate some key needs of the Guild.''
   ``Sometimes you have a feeling you didn't get everything you
wanted,'' Dennison said. ``But both sides can walk away with their
head up.''
   For top scale reporters, photographers, copy editors and
district circulation managers, the bonuses will be $2,000 in the
first year, $1,750 in the second and $1,500 in the third, Brandt
and Dennison said.
   The pay raises for top-scale employees will amount to about $26
a week in each of the last three years, they said.
   Weiner said the package averages out to a 1.6 percent annual
increase in pay scales over six years. He called it ``worse by
far'' than the deal struck by Guild employees at the St. Paul
(Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch earlier this year.
   For the first three years of the new pact, top minimum weekly
salaries for Guild members will remain at $315.50 for copy aides;
$742.50 for circulation district managers; $812 for reporters,
photographers, copy editors and promotion personnel; and $895.75
for some editors.
   The Minneapolis unit has been working without a contract since
its three-year pact expired July 31. The unit covers about 300
newsroom employees and about 60 circulation and promotion workers.

<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats are attacking the Bush
administration's willingness to accept automatic budget cuts that
would force the Defense Department to reduce the nation's armed
forces.
   ``It would be a disaster if Congress and the administration
decide to go over the cliff,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday as Pentagon
officials described the impact of automatic reductions on the four
military branches.
   The 2.1 million active duty armed forces would have to be
reduced by about 229,000 in fiscal 1990 under the cuts, with the
Air Force cut by 80,000, the Navy by 76,000, the Army by 62,000 and
the Marine Corps by 11,000.
   Military contracts for such big-ticket items as the
multiple-warhead MX nuclear missile and the Advanced Tactical
Fighter would also have to be renegotiated, the Pentagon said.
   The automatic budget cuts are necessary because of Congress'
failure to pass a deficit reconciliation bill aimed at complying
with the budget-cutting requirements of the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing law.
   President Bush has said he would be willing to live with the
cutbacks in fiscal 1990 rather than accept a budget reconciliation
bill that does not result in real deficit reductions. The president
is seeking $14 billion in cuts; Congress has indicated a $12
billion cut is possible.
   House and Senate negotiators are still thrashing out
reconciliation legislation.
   Without the legislation, federal programs would suffer $16.1
billion in automatic cuts, with half targeting the Defense
Department.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee invited Pentagon officials
to Capitol Hill to describe the impact of the automatic budget
cuts. At the session, however, members of the panel fell into
partisan bickering.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said he could not believe that Bush,
``the great defender of America,'' would accept the defense
reductions that would be ``absolutely devastating'' to the military.
   ``The effect of this decision would be to take us back to the
readiness levels of the mid-1970s,'' said Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,
D-Tenn., who indicated that the ``zillions of dollars'' spent
during the Reagan and Bush administrations on building up the
nation's defense would be for naught.
   But Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the
committee, said Congress must share some of the blame.
   ``We're in this hearing because Congress failed to do its job,''
Warner said. ``We've got a lot of faults. We didn't come into this
with clean hands.''
   In the House, Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican
on the Budget Committee, shrugged off the concerns expressed by
Senate Democrats, and told reporters the Bush administration is
``not paralyzed with fear like the last administration was'' over
the automatic cuts.
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., said that if ``defense had more
flexibility,'' he would favor the required budget cuts.
   During the session, the Defense Department's comptroller, Sean
O'Keefe, and representatives of the Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine Corps described the steps they would have to take in
response to the 4.3 percent across-the-board cuts.
   O'Keefe urged Congress to approve a Pentagon request that would
give them the authority to move money around to minimize the effect
of the automatic budget cuts.
   Nunn said he supports that request but indicated other
congressional committees oppose the Pentagon's call and the
likelihood of approval is slim.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will comply with the budget cuts
``however painful that may be,'' O'Keefe said.

   An abstract work by Willem de Kooning sold for
$20.6 million to a Japanese collector, setting an auction record
for a work by a living artist, Sotheby's said.
   The 1955 oil-on-canvas painting ``Interchange'' was bought
Wednesday by Shigeki Kameyama of the Mountain Tortoise Co. of Toyko.
   It had been acquired by Edgar Kaufmann Jr. in the year it was
painted and had been expected to sell for $4 million to $6 million,
said Matthew Weigman, a spokesman for the auction house.
   ``(Auctioneer) John Marion said, `Can I have a bid of $1.6
million?' and Bo Alveryd, sitting in the front row, immediately bid
$6 million,'' Weigman said.
   Alveryd, a Swedish dealer who lives in Switzerland, stayed in
until the bidding hit $15 million but a telephone bidder kept the
contest going, Weigman said. When the gavel fell, 4,000 hands burst
into applause.
   The previous records for an auctioned work by a living artist
were set when S.I. Newhouse Jr. paid $17 million for Jasper Johns'
``False Start'' last November at Sotheby's, Weigman said.
   Wednesday night's sale of works from various collections brought
in $91 million, which Sotheby's said was a record for any session
of contemporary art at auction.
   Records were set for 12 artists and 19 lots sold for more than
$1 million, Weigman said.
   Alveryd did win the bidding for Jasper Johns' oil-on-canvas
``Two Flags'' at $12.1 million.
   Frank Stella's ``Tomlinson Court Park (Second Version),''
concentric rectangles in black enamel on canvas, sold for $5.06
million.
   The top seller at Christie's auction Wednesday also was a de
Kooning, an oil painting called ``Woman in Landscape No. 10,''
which went for $825,000, said a Christie's spokeswoman, Dana
Micucci.
   ``Ultima Thule,'' a steel sculpture by John Chamberlain, drew
$253,000, a record for Chamberlain, Micucci said.
   And Ed Ruscha's oil on canvas ``The Sixties and Seventies'' drew
$203,500, also an artist's record.

   ``Dallas'' star Victoria Principal finds it
easier to get roles now that she produces television programs in
which she can cast herself.
   Principal, who played Pam Ewing on the ``Dallas'' television
series, said in this week's US magazine she is just hitting her
stride as an actress and producer.
   ``I'm also producing, frankly, because some of the parts I want
to play I didn't think anyone but myself would offer me,'' she
said. ``So now I produce, and I give me the part.''
   Principal, 39, learned Braille to play a blind woman in her
production of the ABC movie ``Blind Witness,'' to be broadcast Nov.
26.
   Off screen, her marriage to Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Harry
Glassman, 44, in 1985 has made her life complete, she said.
   ``I learned how to pretend to be a woman,'' she said. ``It was
nice when I finally caught up with myself and most importantly,
when I met Harry, when I could finally stop pretending.''

   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping today resigned from
his last Communist Party post, as head of the powerful military
commission, and cleared the way for his chosen successor to assume
undisputed power.
   Deng, 85, was replaced by the protege, 63-year-old Communist
Party chief Jiang Zemin as head of the Central Military Commission.
The move was approved by the ruling party's Central Committee in a
meeting that ended today.
   The committee also issued a communique warning that China must
go through at least two more years of economic austerity to
overcome current problems of inflation, excessive growth and
corruption.
   The official Xinhua News Agency announced Deng's resignation.
   The architect of Chinese policy for the past decade, Deng has
been seeking to make way for a new generation of leaders centered
around Jiang though apparently meeting some resistance from
President Yang Shangkun and his allies.
   Deng, who has served China's Communist cause for six decades,
resigned from the party's ruling Politburo and other top party
posts in 1987 but is still recognized as the ultimate source of
power in the country.
   In a Nov. 7 letter to the Politburo carried by Xinhua he said
giving up the last post while still healthy was his
``long-cherished desire.''
   In the letter, Deng expressed his confidence in the new party
chief, saying party leaders had in June elected ``a leading nucleus
headed by Comrade Jiang Zemin and it is now already carrying out
its work effectively.''
   He said he would now seek to resign from the less important
government body whose functions parallel the party military
commission, which sets policy for the armed forces.
   President Yang, 82, was named the party military commission's
first vice chairman, a job left vacant when former party chief Zhao
Ziyang was stripped of all leadership posts for tolerating the
pro-democracy movement.
   The committee's communique did not mention Zhao, who has been
under house arrest. There had been speculation that the plenum
might recommend criminal charges against Zhao or remove Zhao
supporters from their offices.
   The changes for now end the power struggle diplomatic sources
have reported between Yang, who had been the commission's vice
chairman, and younger party leaders.
   Yang, a hard-liner, reportedly sought to solidify his place in
the post-Deng era by winning the chairmanship, but other senior
party members apparently felt the post should be given to Jiang.
   Yang was one of the principal leaders behind the decision to
declare martial law in Beijing and bring in troops to crush the
pro-democracy movement. Soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed
civilians in a June 4 assault.
   Yang's younger brother, Baibing, the political boss of the
People's Liberation Army, was named secretary-general of the
Central Military Commission.
   The army's chief of staff, Chi Haotian, is said to be Yang's
son-in-law, and there has reportedly been opposition to what
appeared Yang's attempt to establish a family dynasty within the
military.
   Liu Huaqing, formerly deputy secretary general of the commission
and former head of China's navy, was named the commission's second
vice chairman.
   ``Basically, it looks like a compromise,'' a Hong Kong-based
diplomat said of the changes, with Deng getting his way regarding
the chairmanship and Yang getting his way regarding his brother.
   When asked if Jiang could use the position to develop a power
base in the military, the diplomat said: ``If Deng dies, he (Jiang)
has no chance ... I don't think the position makes any difference
whatsoever.''
   Jiang was named party chief June 24 with Deng's backing. He had
been party boss of Shanghai, the country's largest city, but lacks
a national power base.
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new
commission lineup indicates ``nothing's been really resolved'' in
the struggle to succeed Deng. ``There is no clear sign one way or
the other.''
   Xinhua said Deng declared: ``Our cause of reform and opening to
the outside world has just started. We have arduous tasks ahead and
there will be some twists and turns on our way of advance. But I
firmly believe that we will be able to overcome various
difficulties and carry forward the cause pioneered by our
predecessors from generation to generation.''
   Deng was purged twice by radicals during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, then staged a comeback that turned China around
beginning in 1978.
   Under Deng, living standards have improved for tens of millions
of Chinese. He also opened the country to the West as part of his
drive for modernization.
   But the harsh suppression of the spring pro-democracy movement
showed that Deng was not willing to loosen the party's firm grip on
politics.

   A van carrying immigrant factory workers to
their jobs in the suburbs skidded off a damp highway in heavy fog,
crashed into a tree and exploded. Seven people died and eight
others were injured, two critically.
   Police said the driver told investigators the van blew a tire
before veering out of control just before dawn Wednesday on the
Northern State Parkway.
   ``It was wet and extremely slippery. It's like driving on ice,''
said State Police investigator Dale Faro. ``Frankly, I'm amazed
that we didn't have more killed.''
   The van's occupants, all Haitian, lived in Brooklyn and worked
in factories on Long Island, where there has been a shortage of
workers for entry-level jobs. They spoke little English,
complicating the investigation, police said.
   Police said they were investigating whether the van, registered
as a passenger vehicle, was being used illegally as a van for hire
or legally as a car pool.
   Police also were questioning the van's driver, who apparently
did not have a valid New York driver's license, The New York Times
reported.
   Five people were dead at the scene and two others died later of
their injuries, authorities said. Killed were four men, two women
and one person whose sex could not be determined.
   Two of the injured were in critical condition and the six others
were in fair to serious condition.
   Jack Siraucia, of Island Cosmetics, said that two of the workers
in the van, including one of those who died, had worked for him for
about two years.
   ``They were just good, hard-working people,'' he said.

   Complaints about homeless people at the nation's
busiest airport have prompted a plan to move them to shelters. But
advocates for the homeless are criticizing the idea.
   The strategy, still in its formative stages, would clear the
homeless out of O'Hare International Airport through nightly sweeps.
   ``I wouldn't go,'' said a diminutive, white-haired woman, who
gave her name as Jean. ``It's no solution. It's too short-term
because you're only there for a short time and then you're back on
the street, and I know about these things.''
   One of about 200 who live at the airport, Jean said Wednesday
night she hustles baggage carts to make money. She sneaks up behind
airline passengers, waits for them to take the bags off their
rented carts, then sneaks off to return the rental.
   Each returned cart makes her 25 cents. Ten carts buy her a hot
dog.
   ``See that guy? He's been doing it 11 years,'' she said,
pointing out an older man who slipped into a side entrance of a
terminal's cafeteria as the lights were turned off for the evening.
   A Chicago policeman closed the door behind him.
   ``The city offers them free housing and programs downtown ...
but they can make a ton of money out here'' by returning carts,
stealing luggage and recruiting passengers for limousine services,
said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Milton Wilson, a 24-year-old former fast-food restaurant worker
who began living at the airport two weeks ago when he lost his
apartment, disagreed.
   ``There's a lot of people here who don't have a place to go,''
he said. ``At least at a shelter they'll have a bed and a hot meal.
I know I want to go somewhere, not just stay here.''
   Complaints provoked Chicago Aviation Commissioner Jay Franke to
set aside $500,000 out of the $350 million annual airport
operations budget to deal with the homeless problem.
   Ideas include closing the airport for a short time in the early
morning hours, rounding up those who appear to be homeless, and
taking them to a shelter in the surrounding suburbs.
   ``Airports all over the country routinely close in the middle of
the night for a variety of reasons, sometimes for the removal of
live-ins,'' Franke said Wednesday. ``But there's no plan in place,
no dates, no deadlines, no nothing.''
   Elsewhere, efforts have been tried to clear the homeless from
public property.
   For example, in New York City recently, as the number of
homeless people and the number of complaints about them have
continued to rise, officials have adopted codes of conduct in
public spaces and erected barriers that close off areas frequented
by the homeless.
   The O'Hare plan, endorsed by Mayor Richard M. Daley, needs City
Council approval.
   But suburbs surrounding O'Hare have denounced a plan to build a
shelter or to bus the homeless there.
   ``Everybody complains about the homeless at O'Hare ... and the
minute you go to develop a program people complain about that,''
Franke said. ``It appears it's impossible to please everyone.''
   The American Civil Liberties Union, historically opposed to
random sweeps of any kind, said it is monitoring the issue and
would examine the plan's legality when it is proposed.
   And advocates for the homeless say the plan could be
discriminatory.
   ``It'll all be based on what somebody looks like,'' said Mitch
Snyder, who heads the Community for Creative Non-Violence in
Washington, D.C.
   Still, Snyder praised those who want to take the homeless to a
shelter rather than just evict them.
   ``It's better than saying, `Why don't we drive these people out
of here?''' he said. ``It's a more progressive response.''

   A Danish ferry with more than
370 aboard limped into harbor today after a freighter struck it
from behind in the North Sea, killing three passengers and injuring
11 other people, officials said.
   Witnesses said parts of the dance lounge of the passenger ferry
Hamburg were hanging out of a 60-foot gash in the hull after the
Wednesday night collision with the Nordic Stream. The freighter's
deck was littered with cocktail chairs from the ferry.
   By coincidence, the lounge was almost empty when the crash
occurred because the conductor of the ship's band was feeling sick
and had delayed a scheduled evening dance by half an hour, said
officials with ferry owner Scandinavian Seaways.
   The ferry was traveling from Hamburg, West Germany, to Harwich,
England when it was struck. Six seriously injured people were taken
by helicopter from the ferry after the accident south of the island
of Helgoland, said an official with ferry owner Danish Scandinavian
Seaways.
   The official, Hardwig Scheel, said in a radio interview that
experts in Bremerhaven were investigating how the huge ferry,
carrying 277 passengers and 96 crew members, was struck by the
Nordic Stream, a container ship.
   Scandinavian Seaways said the 170-foot ferry, with a capacity of
1,000 people, was struck above and below the water line in the area
of the ship's lounge where people were relaxing.
   Eleven people are known to have been hurt, of which five
remained hospitalized Thursday, Scheel told The Associated Press,
revising an earlier report of 15 injuries.
   He said the identities of the dead were not confirmed but that
they appeared to be two Britons and a German.
   Scandinavian Seaways said the passengers included 60 Britons,
192 Germans, 16 Danes and nine others of unidentified nationality.
   The Hamburg has a gross registered tonnage of 13,141. The
8,026-ton Nordic Stream sails under Panamanian registry.
   The West German sea rescue station in Cuxhaven said the accident
occurred at 10:16 p.m. as the Hamburg was steaming out to sea and
the Nordic Stream was heading toward the Elbe channel in the
direction of Hamburg harbor.
   Officials said a storm warning was in effect at the time of the
accident with high winds and rough seas.
   Rescue officials said evacuation of the injured had been
hampered by the bad weather.
   The ferry sails every two days between Hamburg and Harwich.

   An earthquake shook a large area in

people, authorities said. No damage or injuries were reported.
   The Seismological Institute of the University of Chile said the
quake registered a magnitude of 4.8 in the Richter scale, with its
epicenter in the Andes foothills 27 miles southwest of Santiago.
   The quake was felt at 6:08 a.m.
   The Richter scale is a guage of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a

<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam has
appointed a new foreign minister and deputy prime minister, in a
further shakeup of the Marxist government leadership.
   Two senior government and party officials were retired for
unspecified health reasons, and there was speculation that further
Cabinet changes will be made in coming days.
   The new appointments and retirements came 24 hours after Prime
Minister Fikre-Selassie Wogderess retired for health reasons. He
was the most powerful official in government after Mengistu. He
also was the second-ranking member of the 15-member Politburo of
the ruling Marxist-Leninist Workers Party of Ethiopia.
   The new foreign minister, appointed Wednesday, is Tesfaye Dinka.
   Welle Chekol was named to replace him as deputy prime minister
for financial and economic affairs. He has served previously as
minister of external trade and finance.
   Mengistu appointed Lemma Gutema to the post of vice president in
the Council of State, a semi-legislative body. His last post was as
ambassador to East Germany.
   The former foreign minister, Berhanu Bayih, was named a vice
president in the Council of State. He held the foreign ministry
portfolio for about five years.
   Retired were Debela Dinssa, a Council of State vice president,
and Teka Tulu, who once coordinated intelligence services in the
former military government.
   The reshuffle comes when the Marxist government is under
battlefield pressure from the Tigrey Peoples' Liberation Front and
is talking peace with the Tigreans and Eritrean rebels.
   Although the government and the Tigreans began preliminary talks
in Rome on Saturday, the rebels have showed no sign of halting
their current offensive.

   A con man whose testimony helped convict former
U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall of perjury has been sentenced to four years
in prison for money laundering.
   Charles LeChasney, 35, pleaded guilty in 1988 to conspiring to
launder money in Atlanta, Washington and Puerto Rico.
   In Atlanta, he admitted receiving $710,000 from an undercover
agent and helping launder the money through banks. Chasney was told
the money came from drugs.
   Swindall, a Republican, was found guilty last spring and
sentenced to a year in prison for lying to a federal grand jury
about his negotiations with LeChasney and an undercover IRS agent
who was running a money laundering sting.
   Prosecutors said LeChasney's testimony also helped obtain guilty
pleas from two other defendants.
   U.S. District Judge Robert L. Vining Jr. said Wednesday he would
have given LeChasney at least three more years if prosecutors had
not suggested a lighter sentence.

   A cyclone churned across the coastal
areas of south India today, killing at least 50 people and sweeping
away crops, power lines and mud-and-straw houses, news reports said.
   United News of India said most deaths were reported from Andhra
Pradesh state's Nellore district, about 900 miles southwest of New
Delhi on the eastern coast.
   About 50,000 people were homeless, the news agency said, quoting
state relief officials.
   The news agency said 25 fishermen who ignored the cyclone
warning drowned in the Bay of Bengal off Machilipatnam, 140 miles
north of Nellore. United News also reported 25 other deaths.
   It said property damage could not be immediately determined
because most communication links with the area had snapped.
Preliminary reports said hundreds of power poles and huts had been
swept away, it said.
   The cyclone hit Thailand last week and left at least 169 people
dead before moving westward into the Bay of Bengal. The storm hit
Nellore and neighboring Prakasam district at about 1 a.m.
   A cyclone from the Bay of Bengal left at least 150 people dead
across southern and western Indian in July.
   In 1977, at least 10,000 people were killed in a cyclone in
Andhra Pradesh.

   Mayor Arthur Holland, former president of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors, died of cancer today. He was 71.
   Holland, one of New Jersey's longest-serving mayors, died at St.
Francis Medical Center, where he was admitted Sept. 12.
   He was mayor for 26 of the last 30 years. He lost re-election in
1966 but he returned to office four years later. Trenton mayoral
elections are non-partisan, but Holland described himself as a
Democrat.
   To demonstrate the sincerity of his commitment to civil rights,
Holland in 1964 moved his family into a racially mixed neighborhood.
   In June, he completed a one-year term as president of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, serving as a national spokesman for the needs
of urban America.
   Holland spent six years at a seminary, but did not enter the
priesthood. He began his city government career in 1951 as deputy
director of public affairs. He was elected to the City Council in
1955 and became mayor in 1959.
   Survivors include his wife, Betty, who unsuccessfully ran for
Congress last year; three sons, and two daughters.

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court threw out a $50
million judgment won by a farmer who said a bank defrauded him by
enticing him to borrow millions and then cutting off credit when
his business went sour.
   In a ruling seen as a victory for banks on the issue of ``lender
liability,'' the court Wednesday said Robert Stanghellini failed to
prove the Bank of America committed fraud.
   A jury in 1987 awarded Stanghellini, his elderly mother and aunt
$20 million in compensatory damages and $30 million in punitive
damages. The award was reduced by $3 million, the amount
Stanghellini owed the bank.
   Stanghellini had argued that the bank got him to borrow heavily
to expand and then cut him off after his tomato-growing business
suffered heavy losses in the early 1980s.
   The appeals court cited errors by the trial judge and misconduct
by Richard Murphy, Stanghellini's lawyer.
   Murphy had tried to ``vilify the bank unfairly, both in and out
of court'' make his case ``through sources beyond properly
admissible evidence,'' the court said.
   Murphy was unavailable for comment, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   Recent decisions by appeals courts have reversed several rulings
against banks that abruptly cut off credit to long-standing
customers who began losing money.

<HEAD>President Tells White Extremists Reforms Will Continue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk today told
leaders of two white extremist groups that he rejected their
proposal for a whites-only homeland and will continue to pursue
power-sharing with blacks.
   The meeting was the first ever between a South African head of
state and Eugene TerreBlanche, leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner
Resistance Movement. It is the country's most powerful
white-supremacist group.
   TerreBlanche, who wore a khaki uniform to the hourlong meeting,
was accompanied by Robert von Tonder, head of the Boerestaat Party.
   Both organizations advocate creation of a whites-only nation in
the northeastern third of South Africa, to be controlled by the
Afrikaners who make up 60 percent of the country's 5 million white
population.
   ``I don't think the proposals of those two parties are realistic
or very workable,'' De Klerk, also an Afrikaner, told a news
conference after the meeting. ``I sincerely believe Eugene
TerreBlanche does not represent a substantial number of people in
South Africa.''
   TerreBlanche declined comment and left the president's office in
the company of 10 bodyguards in khaki uniforms bearing the
movement's swastika-like emblem. He was expected to talk about the
meeting at a speech scheduled for tonight in Boksburg, a
Johannesburg-area industrial town controlled by the far-right
Conservative Party.
   The president said TerreBlanche did not warn that his movement
might take up arms against the government. But, ``should
revolutionary forces be allowed to take over, they would take up
arms,'' de Klerk said.
   He said TerreBlanche and von Tonder also expressed concern about
the possible consequences of releasing prominent black security
prisoners, such as jailed African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela.
   The meeting was requested by TerreBlanche, a charismatic orator
who often ends his speeches with Hitler-style salutes.
   De Klerk, who took office in mid-August, has offered to meet
leaders across the political spectrum. He conferred last month with
three prominent anti-apartheid church leaders, including Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   In Bloemfontein, provincial capital of the Orange Free State,
seven members of TerreBlanche's movement went on trial today for
allegedly tar-and-feathering Mayor Gus Gouws of the town of Welkom
because he permitted a multiracial foot race.
   Also today, leaders of the African National Congress said
government reform moves are being undercut by action against the
news media and a threat to suspend a leading anti-apartheid
newspaper.
   Home Affairs Minister Eugene Louw has accused the New Nation
newspaper of ``promoting the public image'' of the ANC and warned
the newspaper it could face a suspension of up to three months.
   The weekly newspaper, published by the Southern African Catholic
Bishops Conference, was shut down for three months in 1988 but
maintained an aggressive anti-government stance after returning to
newsstands.
   ``The South African government is mounting a campaign against
the press,'' said Andrew Mlangeni, one of seven ANC leaders
released from prison last month.
   Such a crackdown will undermine any government attempt to create
a ``climate that can make meaningful negotiations possible,''
Mlangeni said on behalf of the ANC leaders.
   Under state of emergency regulations the government has wide
powers of censorship and may close publications for up to three
months without having to justify its action in court.

   A federal judge has refused to release Dr. Orlando
Bosch Avila, an anti-Castro militant fighting deportation as a
terrorist.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Wednesday described
Bosch as a hero of the anti-Castro resistance whose efforts
``became sullied by his extremes.''
   The 62-year-old pediatrician regarded by the FBI as Miami's
``No. 1 terrorist'' has been held in prison here since his return
from Venezuela in 1988.
   Bosch was convicted in a 1968 bazooka attack on a Polish ship in
Miami and fled the United States while on probation in 1974.
   The Justice Department has linked him to bombing raids in Cuba
in the 1960s and bombings throughout the United States and Latin
America in the 1970s.
   He was jailed for 11 years in Venezuela in the bombing of a
Cuban airliner that killed 73 people.
   Bosch's lawyers say he now repudiates violence, and his family
believes he will be killed if deported.
   The question of whether the Justice Department has the authority
to issue a final exclusion order is still before Hoeveler.

   A Republican National Committee staffer
who quit after taking blame for a memo linking House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley's voting record to that of a gay congressman now says he
didn't write the document.
   Mark Goodin resigned as RNC communications director in June over
the memo, which compared Foley's ``liberal voting record'' to that
of Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. The memo was titled ``Tom Foley: Out
of the Liberal Closet.''
   Goodin took responsibility for the four-page memo, which was
circulated to GOP congressional leaders, but said in an interview
published today that he did not write it. He said he took the blame
because it came from his division.
   ``Where I fell down was in not paying enough attention to it,''
Goodin told The News and Courier.
   In June, he told RNC Chairman Lee Atwater, ``I did not envision
the way it (the memo) would be perceived. And for that reason
alone, I am guilty of extraordinarily bad judgment.''
   Leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties were outraged
by the document. Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., called it ``garbage,''
while Democratic chairman Ron Brown insisted President Bush fire
Atwater.
   Goodin said Wednesday the incident ``took a lot of wind out of
my stomach,'' but he maintained he never intended to denigrate
Foley.
   ``I'm not the slash-and-burn type,'' he said.
   Goodin, 34, is a self-employed communications and government
relations consultant in Washington.

<TEXT>
   The South-West Africa People's
Organization, favored to win Namibia's pre-independence election,
today accused its main rival of ``acts of desperation'' as the
five-day voting period passed its halfway point.
   SWAPO spokesman Hidipo Hamutenya said bogus pamphlets intended
to discredit the party were dropped over Katutura, the main black
neighborhood of Windhoek. He also said three-pronged spikes were
placed outside SWAPO offices, damaging the tires of party vehicles.
   ``These are acts of desperation by the DTA, who know they are
doomed,'' he said, referring to the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance.
   Officials of the United Nations contingent that is monitoring
the elections have cited the alliance for several possible
infractions of the election code, including incidents of
intimidation and the display of party posters too close to polling
stations.
   Gerhard Roux, a spokesman for the territorial government, said
today that 60.4 percent of the 701,483 registered voters had cast
ballots Tuesday and Wednesday.
   ``This is quite remarkable _ a figure that speaks well not only
of the system but of the enthusiasm of the Namibian people,'' Roux
said.
   Roux earlier predicted that the turnout could approach 100
percent by the time voting ends Saturday.
   Namibians, many of them first-time voters, are electing a
72-seat assembly that will write a constitution and make Namibia
independent of South Africa after 74 years.
   Voters have been willing to wait for hours in temperatures up to
108 degrees to cast their ballots.
   Election officials said results could be released by Wednesday.
Assembly seats will be allocated according to the proportion of
votes received by each party, and the assembly is to convene one
week after the results are final.
   SWAPO, a leftist movement which waged a 23-year war against
South African rule, could write the constitution on its own if it
wins two-thirds of the assembly seats.
   The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a multiracial coalition that
favors a capitalist economy, was part of the transitional
government installed by South Africa.
   Also today, authorities launched a search for a missing reporter
from The Republican, a Windhoek newspaper published by the
alliance. The reporter, Martin Erastus, was last seen Monday and
his abandoned car was found later near Namibia's northern border
with Angola.
   South Africa captured the vast, mineral-rich territory from
Germany in World War I. It resisted U.N. efforts to get it to leave
Namibia but finally agreed to grant independence under U.N.
supervision.

<TEXT>
   Turgut Ozal, premier for the past six
years, was sworn in as president today in a Parliament ceremony
boycotted by opposition parties. He named Yildirim Akbulut, speaker
of Parliament, as the new premier.
   In his inaugural address, Ozal said one of Turkey's main aims
should be ``to occupy its distinguished place in the European
Community,'' and he called for reform he said is necessary to
become an EC member.
   All 155 opposition deputies also stayed away from the 450-seat
Parliament when Ozal was elected president Oct. 31. All but 20 of
the 283 deputies of Ozal's Motherland Party voted for him.
   Ozal, 62, swore to be free of all bias and to uphold the secular
republic, all its laws and democracy. Cannons fired 101 salvos to
mark his inauguration.
   Ozal proposed that a standing committee on human rights be
established in the Parliament and that judicial reform be
undertaken.
   The appointment of Akbulut, a member of the governing Motherland
Party who has served as speaker since 1987, came as a surprise. He
had not been mentioned among the frontrunners for the job.
Parliament must approve the appointment and is likely to vote next
week.
   Ozal appointed the 54-year-old lawyer apparently because he was
hard-pressed to find a candidate acceptable to all factions of the
party that includes liberals, Moslem fundamentalists and
ultra-nationalists, political analysts said.
   The premier-designate is considered a moderate and exteremely
loyal to Ozal. He served as interior minister in one of Ozal's
Cabinets before the 1987 general election.
   Ozal succeeds Kenan Evren, leader of a 1980 military coup. In a
speech at a second ceremony, Evren proposed that the constitution
be changed to allow voters to elect the president directly.
   Ozal sought and won the presidency at a time when popular
support for his free-market policies had plummeted to about 17
percent, according to recent public opinion polls.
   The opposition, which includes the Social Democrat Populist
Party and the centrist True Path Party led by former premier
Suleyman Demirel, contended that Ozal lacked a popular mandate and
could not be the nonpartisan president required by the constitution.
   The presidency is a highly respected post but has little
executive power. He can veto legislation but Parliament can
overturn his vetoes. He can refuse to appoint Cabinet ministers
suggested by the premier, but this authority has been used
sparingly in the past.
   However, Ozal's successor as premier is hand-picked, and he
remains the power in Turkey.
   Ozal served as premier after his Motherland Party won the 1983
general elections that ended three years of military rule. He is
credited with the success of Turkey's 1980 economic rescue program
and liberalization that brought export-led growth.

   Vandals sliced two telephone cables
today, leaving up to 361,000 customers with limited service in the
biggest such incident in the 3-month-old strike against NYNEX, the
company said.
   Repair crews hoped to have service restored by noon in the four
counties north of New York City, said Peter Muller, a spokesman for
NYNEX susbidiary New York Telephone.
   Service was disrupted to up to 300,000 New York Telephone
customers after the cables were cut in Highland, Muller said.
Vandals sawed through a copper cable and hacked away a 30-foot
section of newer fiber optic cable, he said.
   Customers can make local calls but are having trouble calling
long-distance, Muller said.
   Service also was disrupted to up to 61,000 customers of Contel
of New York, which provides local phone service, said company
spokeswoman Debbie Mazzone.
   More than 520 cases of vandalism to company lines have been
reported since 40,000 members of the Communication Workers union
walked off the job Aug. 6 in a dispute over health benefits, Muller
said.
   Two other phone lines were cut Wednesday night in Hyde Park and
Poughkeepsie, disrupting service to about 800 customers, phone
company officials said. That service was expected to be restored by
tonight.

<HEAD>Moslem Fundamentalists Score Major Electoral Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMAL HALABY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem fundamentalists scored a major
victory today in Jordan's first general election in 22 years,
capturing at least 26 seats in an 80-member Parliament. Former
government officials faired poorly.
   The Islamic fundamentalists, who call for stricter Moslem laws
and the elimination of Israel, swamped their opponents in districts
throughout the country, according to early results.
   The victory appeared to be a setback for King Hussein, who had
appealed to voters to separate religion from politics. Islamic
activists and leftists easily outnumber declared pro-government
deputies.
   Among the victors was Mansour Murad, convicted in Greece of
participating in the 1969 grenade attack by Palestinian guerrillas
on the Athens office of Israel's state airline, El Al, that killed
a child and wounded 14 other people.
   Greece freed him in 1970 to win the freedom of 55 hostages
aboard a hijacked Olympic Airways jetliner.
   Murad edged a member of the fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood to
win the seat in Amman's 3rd District reserved for Circassians, a
group of 19th century Caucasian refugees who settled in Jordan.
   Most results had been officially reported this afternoon, but
those for several large districts remained unclear.
   Official announcements gave the Moslem Brotherhood 19 seats and
they were expected to pick up another five when all results were
tallied.
   Independent Islamic activists, some allied with the Brotherhood,
won seven seats and were expected to pick up about three more.
   Although parties have been banned in Jordan since 1957, the
government allowed the Brotherhood to operate as a charitable
organization, in part to counter the influence of leftist groups.
   Radical leftists won only four to five seats and leftist Arab
nationalists at least nine. Pro-government figures, tribal leaders
and centrists got about 20 seats and were likely to pick up a few
more.
   More than 62 percent of the 877,000 eligible voters cast
ballots, Interior Ministry spokesman Salameh Hamad said. The
elections involved 647 candidates, including 12 women who were able
to vote and seek office for the first time. None seemed likely to
win.
   Women's rights activist Toujan Faisal, who won international
attention when Islamic fundamentalists filed a lawsuit accusing her
of abandoning her faith, was trounced 4-1 by a Moslem Brotherhood
candidate.
   Several prominent pro-government figures were defeated,
including former Public Works Minister Shafiq Zawaideh and former
Industry Minister Hamdi Tabaa.
   By far the biggest winners appeared to be Brotherhood candidates.
   ``The people want Islam and it is not strange for our country
and our people to have such a large number of Moslem candidates
winning,'' said Brotherhood spokesman Ziad Abu Ghanimeh.
   The last nationwide election occurred in April 1967, two months
before Israel captured the West Bank, represented by half the
deputies in the old Parliament.
   It was the first nationwide election since Jordan renounced
claims on the West Bank in favor of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The Parliament must pass all laws and budgets and can reject
cabinets _ something previous legislatures have done several times
in the past.
   The king remains the center of authority. He can dissolve
Parliament at any time and for 22 years has ruled by martial law.

<TEXT>
   Former crewmen of a oil-drilling ship
that capsized during a typhoon said the flat-bottomed vessel was
not fit for rough weather. The ship's U.S. owners blamed faulty
weather forecasting.
   The 5,373-ton Panamanian-flagged Seacrest, operated by Unocal of
Los Angeles, overturned Friday as Typhoon Gay rolled through the
Gulf of Thailand, killing more than 300 people.
   The storm was the worst to hit the country in 35 years.
   Only six of the 97 people aboard Seacrest are known to have
survived the typhoon. Twenty-five bodies have been found, but the
rest of the crew remains missing. All seven American crew members
were feared dead.
   ``That drill ship was made for moderate tropical waters _ it was
never designed to withstand the sort of excessive seas that it took
on Friday,'' said Douglas Whittaker, a crewman on the Seacrest for
10 years.
   He said he was called to help in the rescue operation because of
his knowledge of the ship's layout.
   Whittaker, another Seacrest crewman and relatives of men lost
aboard the ship also accused Unocal of disregarding weather
forecasts and of failing to mount effective rescue efforts.
   The Bangkok newspaper The Nation reported today that some
relatives of missing or dead crewmen were considering legal action
against Unocal.
   Unocal has denied the Seacrest was unseaworthy. Senior company
executives have cited poor weather forcasting as a reason for the
loss of the ship and admitted some shortcomings in rescue attempts.
   John F. Imle Jr., chairman of Unocal Thailand, said at a news
conference Wednesday no company boats were able to approach the
Seacrest until about eight hours after it capsized.
   The Nation quoted Kriangkrai Korwattana, head of the
meteorological center in the southern port of Songkhla, as saying
Unocal had ignored repeated storm warnings.
   ``They had three days to decide what to do,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   The other former Seacrest crewman, a relative of a man missing
in the disaster, accused Unocal of being complacent about weather
conditions in the normally calm gulf.
   ``If this was the North Sea the safety standards would be very
different,'' he said.
   The Seacrest capsized in the Platong field, one of several being
explored for natural gas by Unocal.

   The Sandinista government enters
bargaining with the Contras today with an offer to free all
political prisoners _ but only after half the rebel force is
dismantled and all Sandinista captives are freed.
   The leftist government's revised plan for disbanding the
U.S.-backed rebels offers few new elements. It goes part of the way
toward meeting Contra demands, but carries a threat of renewed war.
   At the heart of the talks is a 3-month-old regional pact to
demobilize the Contra force _ about 12,000 fighters based in jungle
camps in Honduras _ by Dec. 5. President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua
is determined the deadline be met.
   National elections are scheduled for next Feb. 25 and could be
at risk if fighting resumes after 19 months of relative quiet.
   The negotiations are taking place at U.N. headquarters in New
York and include a joint U.N.-Organization of American States
commission as well as Sandinista and Contra delegates.
   The commission was set up by the Aug. 7 peace accord signed in
Tela, Honduras, by Ortega and four other Central American
presidents. Its mission is to supervise and verify the
demobilization.
   In Miami today, the Contras announced the formation of a new
``civilian-military commission'' to act as the governing body in
place of the old directorate, several of whose members have
returned to Nicaragua.
   Contra spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said the U.N. negotiating
team headed by the Contra's military commander, Enrique Bermudez,
has recognized the new commission, which includes only one of the
former directors, Aristides Sanchez.
   As part of the peace accord, in exchange for the dissolution of
the Contras, Ortega moved up the election date from 1991 and
pledged free and fair campaigning and balloting under the
supervision of international observers.
   The most significant items in the Sandinistas' new 15-point
proposal were an offer to release all political prisoners and a
statement guaranteeing the Contras their human and civil rights.
   Even so, these offers are conditional. The political prisoners
would be released only after half the Contra force has been
demobilized and after all Nicaraguans claimed by the Sandinistas to
have been kidnapped by the rebels have been freed.
   Similarly, the human and civil rights guarantee is for those
rebels who lay down their arms and return to Nicaragua.
   Contra leaders say they distrust Sandinista promises. They
demand an unconditional general amnesty and so far have made no
move to demobilize.
   Among nine point in the Sandinista proposal that are not new is
one urging the U.S. Congress to put toward Contra demobilization
the non-lethal aid it has approved to maintain the rebels as a
fighting force.
   ``If the Contras don't accept this plan, they will be voting for
war,'' Ortega told a news conference.
   The Sandinistas also have offered to suspend arms imports until
April 25.
   The Soviet Union said in May it stopped shipping arms to
Nicaragua at the end of 1988, but Paul Wolfowitz, a U.S. Defense
Department undersecretary, said last week that other Soviet bloc
nations and Cuba have continued sending weapons.
   The Sandinistas have also offered to reinstate the cease-fire
Ortega suspended on Nov. 1 and to withdraw the huge military
machinery the government has since deployed so Contras in Nicaragua
can return to Honduras.
   The reverse of this offer is that if the Contras don't agree to
demobilize, the Sandinistas could launch an offensive to wipe out
the 6,500 Contras the government says are in Nicaragua, 4,000 of
whom are said to have infiltrated in the past month.
   Stepped up fighting could make campaigning for the elections
difficult if not impossible in many places. And disrupted balloting
could fuel opposition claims that the Sandinistas were never
serious about free elections.
   The U.N. Security Council is sending a 625-member border patrol
force to stop the Contra infiltration from Honduras and to
interdict shipments of Nicaraguan and Cuban weapons the State
Department says are being made to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   The pact that Ortega and the presidents of Honduras, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica signed calls for the
``voluntary'' demobilization of the rebels force, but the Contras
were not a party to the agreement.
   Honduras, the only party that could force the Contras off its
territory, rejected Ortega's invitation to take part in the
negotiations, saying it never has recognized the Contras legally as
an insurgent force.
   It later relented and sent a delegation to the talks, but only
as observers.
   By attending only as an observer, Honduras apparently hopes to
project an image of cooperation in the regional peace effort while
avoiding a decision on the Contras and possibly angering its ally,
the United States.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Roman Catholic archbishop of
Managua, also was to attend as an observer. He is the only figure
in Nicaragua whose moral authority is recognized and respected by
both sides.
   Ortega has told his negotiating team it must not leave the U.N.
meeting without a signed accord.

   A consumer health group today asked Congress
to revoke an agreement between a cigarette manufacturer and the
National Archives which the group says ``smears the Bill of Rights
with the blood of all Americans killed as a result of smoking.''
   The August agreement makes Philip Morris Companies Inc. part of
an Archives campaign to commemorate the bicentennial of the Bill of
Rights.
   A nationally televised public service announcement that is a
part of the campaign includes the voices of President Kennedy and
Martin Luther King over images of the Bill of Rights and scenes
from civil rights demonstrations. The announcement identifies
Philip Morris as the sponsor.
   ``This joint venture smears the Bill of Rights with the blood of
all Americans killed as a result of smoking Marlboro and other
Philip Morris cigarettes,'' said Sidney Wolfe, director of Public
Citizen Health Research Group, in a letter to Sen. Jeff Bingaman.
   Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat, heads the Government Affairs
Committee's subcommittee on government information which has
jurisdiction over the archives.
   ``The campaign has nothing to do with cigarettes. It's about the
celebration of the Bill of Rights,'' Guy L. Smith, vice president
of corporate affairs for Philip Morris, said today.
   We are only identified at the very end (of the announcement) and
we consciously separated the identification of the company from the
messages about the themes of the Bill of Rights,'' Smith said. ``
We're just sponsoring the messages and the archives is helping us
to make sure they're historically accurate.''
   Smith added that as of this morning, 200,056 people had
requested a copy of the Bill of Rights offered by Philip Morris.
   ``The Bill of Rights belongs to everybody,'' said Smith,
likening his company's sponsorship of the campaign to that of
American Express raising money to refurbish the Statue of Liberty.
   Efforts to reach national archivist Don Wilson by telephone were
unsuccessful.
   The agreement is the first such cooperative effort and
``launches the National Archives' endeavor to engage the corporate
world in supporting events related to America's documentary
heritage,'' Wilson said in a Nov. 1 announcement.
   The agreement with Philip Morris allows the company to ``obscure
its deadly role in American and worldwide society'' and should be
reversed, said Wolfe, who founded the Health Research Group in 1971
with consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
   Under the agreement, Philip Morris donates $600,000 to the
National Archives Trust Fund and is permitted to publish or
broadcast announcements as part of the Bill of Rights bicentennial
commemoration, using voices of prominent Americans such as former
presidents.
   ``What would Martin Luther King or Harry Truman think if they
knew their voices were being made available by the National
Archives in order to improve the image of a company with the deadly

   California has ordered deodorant
makers to give up smog-forming aerosol propellants or find a way to
reduce the pollution they create.
   ``This landmark action requires manufacturers to use more
environmentally acceptable substitutes if they choose to continue
selling aerosols and will likely set a precedent for other consumer
product actions that follow,'' Jananne Sharpless, chairwoman of the
state Air Resources Board, said in a statement.
   Manufacturers and industry experts said the move against
underarm sprays could open the door to restrictions on other
aerosol products such as hair spray and prompt some manufacturers
to pull their products out of California.
   Hydrocarbons are used as a propellant to spray many products.
They became popular after 1978 when chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
were banned in the United States because of their danger to the
ozone layer. Hydrocarbons cause no known damage to the ozone but
combine with other pollutants to create smog.
   The Air Resources Board on Wednesday gave manufacturers of
antiperspirants and deodorants until 1992 to reduce smog-creating
hydrocarbons by 20 percent. The order also calls for an additional
60 percent cut by 1995.
   Manufacturers will be given the option of providing a plan to
comply with the ruling by 1999, using yet-to-be developed products
that spray without polluting. The delay will allow time for safety
testing.
   The board suggested the use of substitute propellants and such
mechanical features as pumps.
   The order could lead manufacturers to concentrate on sales of
roll-on and solid antiperspirants and deodorants, which account for
75 percent of sales in California.
   ``There already are more environmentally acceptable alternatives
for aerosol deodorants that are being purchased by three out of
every four Californians,'' Ms. Sharpless said.
   Manufacturers said they were not sure of the ruling's impact but
suggested board members were opening the way for restrictions on
other products.
   ``Their intention is to ban aerosols. This is step No. 1. The
only reason they aren't putting an outright ban is because there
would be a hundred lawsuits,'' said George C. Dietrich, president
of Diversified CPC International, a manufacturer based in Illinois.
   Edward Haiden, an economic consultant from Washington, said some
manufacturers may simply decide not to do business in California.
   ``Most companies couldn't have a two-product distribution system
_ one for California and another for the rest of the nation,'' he
said.
   Deodorant makers had earlier appealed to the board because they
felt the restrictions would cost millions of dollars and have
little effect on pollution.
   ``We believe the emission reduction is so small that it doesn't
warrant this kind of treatment,'' said Ralph Engel of the Chemical
Specialty Manufacturers Association.
   The board has authority over the quality of California's air,
and its order on aerosols does not need the Legislature's approval.
   The action was taken in conjunction with the first phase of a
20-year, three-part plan approved in August to help smoggy Southern
California meet federal clean-air requirements. The first phase
also will include a ban on barbecue lighter fluid and restrictions
on smokestack emissions.
   Spray underarm deodorants and antiperspirants release about five
tons of pollutants into the air statewide every day, the board said.

<TEXT>
   When the orange sunset glows on the white
wood frame houses along Ninth Street, most of the neighbors of
``Crack Alley'' know it's time to get off the streets.
   But federal drug czar William Bennett didn't see the area of
north-central Wichita at its worst during his visit today. The
tired-looking but homey neighborhood seems quiet during daylight
hours.
   Bennett met with law officers and substance abuse experts at
City Hall, where Police Chief Rick Stone boasted, ``You spend about
$1 million in this community and we'll show you what hometown
U.S.A. can do to clean up its own act.''
   The nation's drug policy chief gave assurances that the
government is devoting more money to fighting drugs, but he said,
``I didn't bring my checkbook with me. I'm not the secretary of
treasury. I'm in charge of drug policy.''
   During the day here, the old two-chair barber shop operates, and
dilapidated, paint-starved Turner Drug with its 1950s soda fountain
decor is open for business. A few residents visit with each other
outdoors; kids gather on the playground at Dunbar School.
   It's a different world after dark.
   As soon as night falls, the neighborhood begins its deadly
transformation. Children are whisked into homes by their parents,
laid-back corner dwellers abandon the sidewalks and the shadows
that congregate near ``No Loitering'' signs don't promise comradery.
   During the past year, several blocks on either side of Ninth
Street have become a free-fire zone for dealers and buyers of crack
cocaine. During the past three months, four people have died from
gunfire there; three people were wounded last week.
   Police investigating assaults and homicides are sometimes
frustrated because the number of fresh and old shell casings on the
ground make it difficult to sort out usable evidence.
   ``There is shooting every night,'' said Larry Phillips, 34, a
lifelong Wichitan who still hangs around the area to visit friends.
``They don't always hit somebody. Sometimes they just shoot up in
the air to scare people.''
   Phillips said he was nearby when 20-year-old Lisa Lang was
struck by a stray bullet Oct. 28 while visiting with friends. Lang,
who was eight months pregnant, died. Her baby was delivered by
Caesarean section but died four hours later.
   The 18-year-old suspect is charged in another ``Crack Alley''
shooting two days earlier at the same intersection. The teen-age
victim told police he was walking away from an argument between a
drug dealer and some women when the dealer shot him in the arm and
leg.
   ``It used to be a good fun place where you could go hang with
your partners. Not any more,'' said a woman who was with Larry
Phillips on Tuesday night. ``I come down here to get my honey, but
I stay away from what's going on.''
   There was fear in her voice when a white reporter who had
offered the black couple a ride started to drive toward one of the
local hangouts, a liquor store with scantily stocked shelves and
wire and wrought-iron protected windows.
   ``If you're going this way I'm going to duck down because they
see me driving around with a white man I might get shot as a snitch
next time I'm out on the street,'' she said.
   Police have increased patrols in the area for months, but the
violence continues. Last weekend a 60-year-old man, who was
awaiting trial on drug charges, was stabbed to death.
   Most of the cocaine is brought in by Dominicans who control much
of the crack trade in New York City, police say. Wichita has seen
drugs before, but never such drug-related violence.
   An 80-year-old woman who has lived in the neighborhood since the
1930s said she hears gunfire sometimes at night after she turns off
her television.
   ``I just try not to pay attention to it, because the more I
think about it the worse I feel,'' she said, asking not to be
identified for fear of reprisal.
   ``I don't feel too afraid unless somebody comes knocking on my
door or something. But I don't answer my door.''

<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl arrived
today for a six-day visit that will take him to Auschwitz and the
ethnic German region of Krzyzowa.
   It marked the first visit to Poland by a West German leader
since 1977 and Kohl's first meeting with new Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki. Kohl brought a $1 billion aid package that the first
non-Communist government in the East bloc hopes will help secure
democratic reforms.
   Mazowiecki, the former Solidarity editor elected two months ago,
and several other top Polish government officials greeted Kohl at
Warsaw's Okecie airport.
   Kohl exchanged words with school children in the welcoming party
before leaving for talks with Mazowiecki.
   Earlier today, sources disclosed that Kohl's visit to the
Auschwitz concentration camp had been changed because the head of
West Germany's Jewish community, Heinz Galinski, said he could not
join the event on the Sabbath.
   Among the 4 million victims of the Holocaust's most infamous
concentration camp were 2.5 million Jews.
   Polish and West German officials arranging the trip held an
emergency meeting today and agreed that Kohl and the others would
go to Auschwitz on Sunday.
   Emotional sensitivity still runs high in both nations which have
yet to overcome memories of old territorial disputes and the legacy
of the Nazi era.
   Polish discomfort over a visit by Kohl to Gora Sw. Anny, known
in German as Annaberg, the site of a bloody battle in 1921 over
whether the area should go to Poland or Germany forced a search for
another place for Kohl to meet with ethnic Germans.
   So instead Kohl will travel on Sunday to Krzyzowa, a Silesian
town where Nazi resisters met during the war, Jaroslaw Szczepanski,
deputy director of the government press office.

<HEAD>Congressional Leaders Agree to Allow Senate Debate on Capital-Gains
Tax</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congressional leaders agreed today to allow
the Senate to debate President Bush's proposed capital-gains tax
reduction, but there appeared little chance it would clear Congress.
   The agreement was announced by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash. He said the House would pass in a new bill the
capital-gains cut that it approved on Sept. 28 as part of a
deficit-reduction plan.
   Senate Republicans would offer their own capital-gains cut as a
substitute for the House plan, and the debate would center on the
GOP proposal.
   However, neither proposal is likely to become law this year
because most Senate Democrats are opposed. It would take 60 votes
to cut off a Democratic filibuster against a capital-gains cut, and
even Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole acknowledged today that
chances of getting that many votes are ``iffy.''
   Bush and Republicans failed in earlier attempts to attach a
capital-gains cut to the Senate deficit-reduction bill and to a
measure raising the government's borrowing authority. Some
lawmakers feared that if they engaged in a lengthy debate, those
bills could be jeopardized.
   In next week's debate, capital gains will not be tied to any
other issue, Dole noted. ``That excuse will be gone,'' he said.
``Either they are for or against capital gains. No more excuses.''
   Present law taxes capital gains, which are profits from the sale
of investments, at the same rates as wages and other incomes.
During his campaign last year, Bush proposed a lower tax on capital
gains as a way to spur investment and economic growth.
   Democratic leaders oppose a capital-gains tax cut on grounds 80
percent of the benefits would go to those with incomes above
$200,000 a year. They also say that restoring a preferential tax
rate for capital gains would begin the unraveling of the landmark
1986 tax overhaul.
   With the backing of 64 Democrats, Bush was able to win a
reduction in the House but the effort stalled in the Senate.
   The House-passed proposal would exempt 30 percent of capital
gains from taxation until 1992. Starting in 1992, the system would
be ``indexed'' so that the portion of gains caused by inflation
would not be taxed.
   The plan proposed by Senate Republicans would allow an exemption
based on how long an asset was held. If property was owned for more
than a year, 5 percent of the profit would be tax-exempt. The
exempt portion would increase by 5 percentage points each year to a
maximum of seven years; thus, 35 percent of profit from the sale of
an asset owned more than seven years would escape taxation.
   The GOP plan also includes an expansion of Individual Retirement
Accounts. Unlike present IRAs, which provide tax deductions for
some workers at the time a deposit is made, the GOP IRAs would
offer no tax benefit until the money is withdrawn for retirement,
or education or medical expenses.

   A school employee falsely claimed her
daughter had leukemia and collected $1,400 in donations from
faculty and PTA members, authorities say.
   Donna Leeper, 43, who worked in a PTA-funded position at the
Hopkins Elementary School clinic, was indicted Tuesday on charges
of theft and making a false statement. She had been arrested in
June and was free on bail.
   Authorities said Ms. Leeper told her colleagues last spring that
her 9-year-old daughter had leukemia and needed experimental
surgery.
   Investigators later learned that the woman had been convicted of
manslaughter in Maryland in 1978 for shooting her husband and
served a year in prison.
   Dan Parks, chairman of the Gwinnett Board of Education, said the
PTA does not fall under board control.
   ``You don't want to make people who volunteer, and people who do
so much good for the school system, you don't want to upset those
people by telling them, `You can't come in and help until we do a
background check,''' he said.
   ``They help out tremendously with volunteers in the schools.''

   The Nicaraguan Contras today announced the
formation of a civilian-military commission to lead the rebels as
peace talks get under way at the United Nations.
   The old seven-member directorate had virtually ceased
functioning after three of its members returned to Nicaragua and
the Bush administration cut off financial support to its
headquarters here.
   The new four-member ruling body, which has set up a temporary
office in Miami, was chosen by military commanders, said Commander
Franklin, one of the members of the commission and the Contra's
military chief of staff. Contra military leaders traditionally
employ pseudonyms.
   Only one member of the now-defunct directorate, Aristides
Sanchez, will participate in the new commission, said Franklin. The
other two members are military leaders like Franklin, known only as
Commanders Dimas and Ruben.
   In addition to Contra and Sandinista delegates, the talks that
begin today at U.N. headquarters in New York include a joint
U.N.-Organization of American States commission.
   The Contra representatives at the U.N. have recognized the new
commission's authority, said Contra spokesman Alejandro Acevedo.
The leader of the negotiators, Enrique Bermudez, was a former
member of the directorate.

<HEAD>Democrats Celebrate; Republicans Argue About Impact of Abortion Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 10 graphs new to update with Wilder and Dinkins appearing
at Capitol; picks up 4th graf pvs, In Virginia.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Victorious black Democrats toured the Capitol
today and L. Douglas Wilder said his triumph in the Virginia
governor's race proved ``Americans have come of age.'' Republicans
were debating whether their 1989 election debacle was an ominous
sign about their prospects for the much heavier ballot slate in
1990.
   During a meeting with Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, Wilder joked about the narrowness of his margin _ a
majority his Republican opponent still questions.
   Turning to David Dinkins, the mayor-elect of New York City,
Wilder congratulated him and other Democrats, ``some of whom had
landslide victories like I did.''
   Wilder was asked if racism was the reason he ran behind other
Democratic candidates for statewide office and he replied, ``It
says I had a very negative campaign being waged against me and my
ticketmates didn't.''
   ``Americans have come of age,'' Wilder said. ``What was preached
and practiced for some time has come full cycle.''
   ``I don't think Doug is saying that racism is not a factor'' in
elections, said Dinkins. ``But I do believe that tremendous
progress has been achieved. But things are not perfect in our land,
to be sure. It's (racism) on the wane. It's not as great as it
was.''
   Democrats were jubilant as they tallied gains that included the
governor's mansion in New Jersey as well as the State Assembly and
the election of blacks as governor of Virginia and mayor of New
York City.
   Analysts of political trends among blacks hailed not only the
results in Virginia and New York, but also in such cities as
Seattle, New Haven, Conn., Cleveland and Durham, N.C., as ``a new
direction.''
   Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown, appearing with Wilder and
Dinkins, said he believes the election demonstrated that the
Republican Party's stance on abortion is ``an untenable position.''
He said he believes President Bush has ``painted himself into a
corner'' by taking a strong anti-abortion position.
   Brown said Tuesday's election results show the Democratic Party
``is not only alive and well, but strong and getting stronger.''
Standing between Wilder and Dinkins, the chairman praised the two
blacks as men who projected themselves as ``mainstream Democrats''
whose appeal transcended race.
   ``We've built tremendous momentum,'' he said. ``We think it's an
important building block'' as the party looks to the 1990
congressional elections and the 1992 race for the White House.
   In Virginia, Republican J. Marshall Coleman said the outcome of
the governor's race was ``still in doubt.'' He said that if the
official vote tally, due in four more days, shows Wilder's victory
margin in the governor's race is as narrow as expected, he will ask
for a recount.
   The unofficial tally showed Wilder leading Coleman by about
5,500 votes out of a total of 1.78 million cast. Virginia law
authorizes recounts if the difference is less than one half of 1
percent.
   ``There's no way for the Republican Party to find any silver
lining at all in what happened yesterday,'' Brown said Wednesday.
   ``No time in my lifetime do I ever remember waking up the
morning after an election where one party had won everything, all
over the country.''
   ``The Democrats are on a roll,'' said Rep. Beryl Anthony of
Arkansas, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee. ``We have recruited better candidates. Our candidates
have better mainstream messages. And the voters are responding.''
   Many Republicans followed the lead of party chairman Lee Atwater
in brushing off GOP losses with the comment that ``all politics is
local.''
   ``It's hard to see a message,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards of
Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Policy committee.
   But House Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia saw the
results as a clear warning.
   ``Any Republican who looks honestly at yesterday's results has
to be very sobered up and has to be willing to rethink exactly what
we're going to do in 1990 if we're going to have a successful
year,'' said Gingrich after a White House post-mortem on the
elections.
   Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, one of the Republican Party's
strongest supporters of abortion rights, emerged from the meeting
and said that if abortion is an issue in 1990 ``we will just get
the bejabbers kicked out of us.''
   Gingrich called abortion ``a very small part of the equation.''
   ``We as a party, we're not big enough, we don't run aggressive
enough campaigns, we don't stay in the game full-time,'' said the
Georgia congressman.
   Defections on the abortion issue already are beginning. In
Massachusetts, Republican gubernatorial candidate William Weld and
a number of GOP state legislators joined Democrats in signing a
petition seeking a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing the
right to abortion.
   Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, said the results demonstrated that ``if George Bush and
members of his party remain beholden to the anti-choice minority,
they will pay a tremendous price at the polls.''
   ``The lesson that will be learned ... is that pro-life
candidates cannot waffle and pro-life candidates must run as
aggressively on this issue as pro-abortion candidates,'' said David
O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee.
   Bush campaigned for the losers in Virginia, New Jersey and New
York City. His only comment on Wednesday was ``wait 'till next
year.''
   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman who normally specializes
in foreign affairs, handled political questions in the absence of
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater and told reporters, ``Suffice it
to say, this election's over with. We're pleased with the victory
that our candidates have achieved in certain elections and we're
looking forward to the 1990 elections. We're looking forward
optimistically to 1990.''

   The Wilkes Bashford posh clothing store,
concerned its Oakland and suburban customers cannot reach its store
in the quake-damaged downtown, has decided to bring the merchandise
to their doorsteps.
   Beginning Monday, a luxury recreational vehicle staffed by a
salesperson and a tailor will deliver custom-selected clothing to
the homes of customers requesting the service, said Wilkes
Bashford, the store's founder.
   Bashford's sales are down about 20 percent since the Oct. 17
earthquake, which forced officials to reroute downtown traffic and
created jams.
   ``We came up with the idea after a couple of our very important
customers canceled appointments because they said they didn't want

   Phillips Petroleum Co. says it will
rebuild a smaller version of the polyethylene plant that was
destroyed last month by a series of explosions.
   The new plant, scheduled for completion late next year, will
have less than half the capacity of the old one, producing up to
600 million pounds annually _ compared with the 1.6 billion-pound
capacity of the old plant, Phillips said Wednesday.
   Twenty-three people died in the Oct. 23 explosion, including
four whose bodies have not been recovered. About 240 people were
left without jobs.
   Phillips said the new plant will employ about 80 people.
   Company spokesman Jere Smith said Phillips will be able to
restart some production before the entire project is completed.
   An addition to the old plant, another facility was already under
construction at the time of the explosion, and that facility is
still scheduled to begin production in June with a capacity of 300
million pounds, Smith said.

   It took two tries, but a 104-ton steam
locomotive built in China and destined for Iowa was hoisted out of
a cargo ship after it was dropped and slightly damaged during a
test lift.
   The new locomotive, the last steamer manufactured at the Datong
Engine Works in China, was unloaded from the cargo hold Wednesday
and was to be transferred to a rail flat car within two days for
shipment to Boone, Iowa, as a tourist attraction, officials said.
   The first attempt to lift the locomotive with the ship's crane
backfired Tuesday when the engine dropped a few inches, slightly
damaging the cab, said Dean Briley, a board member of the Boone &amp;
Scenic Valley Railroad, which bought the locomotive for $355,000.
   Workers succeeded the following day using a barge crane, Briley
said.

billion and estimates more than 40,000 people will need counseling.
   The two-inch-thick report produced last week by the state Budget
and Control Board gives a snapshot of the state through Oct. 27,
five weeks after Hugo blew ashore. It covers preliminary damage
assessments and relief efforts from 25 agencies.
   The report is expected to be updated as more precise assessments
become available.
   Hugo hit South Carolina on Sept. 21, killing 18 people in the
state and 11 others elsewhere on the U.S. mainland.
   Among the report's findings:
   _Damage was put at $4 billion, although that will undoubtedly be
adjusted once tax assessors and insurance companies refine their
figures. Gov. Carroll Campbell's spokesman, Tucker Eskew, has
quoted estimates of $5 billion to $6 billion.
   _The Federal Emergency Management Agency expects to spend $149.3
million in assistance to state and local governments. South
Carolina will dispense $8.2 million in such aid.
   _Damage to the agriculture economy, including timber, soils and
crops, is estimated at $1.4 billion or higher.
   _Forty percent of the state's 3,000 public water systems were
affected.
   _The Department of Mental Health estimates 40,069 people
statewide will need some form of counseling.
   _The value of homes destroyed was estimated by the Red Cross at
$539 million.
   _FEMA spent $16.5 million in housing aid and grants.
   _The Ports Authority estimated damage to equipment, docks and
other facilities at $12.5 million.
   _Southern Bell put damage to its phone network at $50 million.
   _Damage to schools was estimated at $55 million.
   _While the unemployment rolls swelled to nearly 300,000
immediately after the storm, only 30,000 people have applied for
unemployment compensation.

   President Bush gave a warm welcome to
Philippines President Corazon Aquino today and predicted that their
countries will be able to reach a new agreement governing U.S.
access to military bases in the Philippines.
   With Mrs. Aquino standing at his side during a rain-spattered
arrival ceremony on the White House south lawn, Bush said, ``We are
confident we'll mold a new and mutually beneficial long-term
security partnership in the future.''
   Mrs. Aquino has remained silent on the issue, refusing to say
whether she believes a continued U.S. military presence in the
Philippines is desireable.
   She made no reference to the base issue in her arrival
statement, indicating that the focus of her talks would be on
economic issues.
   Asked by reporters about the base issue later while posing for
photographers with Bush, Mrs. Aquino noted only that preliminary
talks begin next month.
   In her formal remarks, she said: ``We will raise particularly
the means by which the Philippines and the United States can
cooperate in more ways to our mutual economic benefit. We shall
explore the means to increase trade between two countries with long
historic ties and deep cultural affinities.''
   Bush spoke warmly of Mrs. Aquino's success in helping restore
democracy to the Philippines after long years of authoritarian rule
during the Marcos era.
   He called the Philippines ``a beacon of democracy worthy of
imitation throughout the world.''
   After her meeting with Bush, Mrs. Aquino planned to attend a
luncheon hosted by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and meet
with House and Senate leaders. She is the guest of honor at a White
House state dinner tonight.
   The two main themes during her visit, which ends Saturday night,
will be trade and investment.
   U.S. support for Mrs. Aquino remains strong, but she is not
expected to match the tumultuous reception she had in 1986 when she
visited seven months after leading the successful fight to depose
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   She so charmed Congress that lawmakers rammed through a $200
million aid package for the Philippines in record time.
   Since then, the mutual confidence of the two countries has been
shaken somewhat by acrimonious negotiations last year over the
terms for the continued U.S. military presence in the Philippines.
   Also contributing to the sense of unease is Mrs. Aquino's
refusal to rule out the possibility that she might ask United
States soldiers to leave once the existing agreement on U.S.
military bases expires in 1991.
   Mrs. Aquino's ambivalence reflects the existence of an
influential minority in the Philippines which believes the
continued U.S. presence at the bases infringes on Filipino
sovereignty.
   Talks on a new base agreement open next month and U.S. officials
believe that, after considerable wrangling, they will conclude with
agreement that the bases remain.
   ``We think that there's a logic that both parties will see at
the end. That is to say that these facilities do, in fact, serve
the interests of both countries in very important ways,'' said a
U.S. official who briefed reporters Tuesday on condition that he
not be identified.
   ``And I think that will be the compelling fact that will assert
itself. And I think we will have an agreement.''
   The two principal installations are Subic Bay Naval Base and
Clark Air Base. They are considered among the most important U.S.
military facilities abroad.
   Congressional attitudes towards the Philippines are somewhat
more tightfisted than before because some lawmakers believe
economic reform and increased trade would improve living standards
there more than additional economic aid.
   Still, Mrs. Aquino commands a considerable measure of good will
both in the United States and in other Western democracies.
   One example is the commitment among donor countries to provide
the Philippines with $14 billion in aid over five years.
   During her stay, Mrs. Aquino is expected to stress her
accomplishments since 1986, including the consolidation of
democracy, the failure of five coup attempts, a restoration of
economic growth and a leveling off of the threat of the Marxist
insurgency.

   Petite Soeur Magdeleine de Jesus, author and
founder of an order of Roman Catholic nuns, has died at the age of
91.
   She died Monday at the order's headquarters in Rome, where her
funeral is scheduled Friday.
   Born Magdeleine Hutin at Montigny-les-Metz in eastern France on
April 26, 1898, she founded the Fraternite des Petites Soeurs de
Jesus _ the Little Sisters of Jesus _ in 1939, in the Saharan
outpost of Touggourt, Algeria.
   The order, which has 1,400 nuns of about 60 nationalities on
five continents, is devoted to the contemplative life in the middle
of the active world. Its members share the poverty and social
condition of manual laborers in slums and shantytowns around the
world.
   She wrote two works, ``From One End of the Earth to the Other,''
and ``From the Sahara to the Whole World.''

   Technicians working to clean the statues that adorn
the Trevi Fountain in Rome have discovered that corrosion in the
metal supporting clamps has left several of the marble figures
dangerously unstable.
   The discovery means the year-old project to clean the landmark
will have to be postponed until next year while technicians turn
their attention to replacing the clamps, the daily newspaper La
Repubblica said Thursday.
   The 18th century masterpiece is the work of the celebrated
architect Nicola Salvi, who won a competition sponsored by Pope
Clement XII to build the fountain. Salvi did not live to see the
monument finished.
   Antonio Giuffre, a member of the architecture faculty at the
University of Rome, will take charge of the project to replace the
corroded braces.
   ``The statues will be only partly dismantled, the pieces being
then reset using titanium clamps,'' he said.

<HEAD>Company Designs 500-Story Building, But No Plans to Build It</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A construction company said Thursday it has
designed a 500-story skyscraper for Tokyo, although there are no
immediate plans to build it.
   The designers would need 25 years and $326.2 billion to build
the 6,669-foot-tall ``Aeropolis 2001,'' said Yasuyuki Kimura, a
spokesman for Ohbayashi Corp.
   This includes the money necessary to reclaim a 56-square-mile
island in Tokyo Bay, he added.
   The project was made possible by Japan's advanced techniques to
protect buildings in earthquakes, he said.
   The tallest building in earthquake-prone Japan is the 60-story
Sunshine City Building in Tokyo. The 110-story Sears Tower in
Chicago is the world's tallest building.
   Yukihisa Tokunaga, a city planning official of the Construction
Ministry, said the 500-story building is one of a number of private
plans by major construction firms to meet Tokyo's growing need for
office and apartment space.
   ``I understand that none of the plans, including what they call
`Waterfronts,' `Geofronts,' `Undergroundpolis' and `Aeropolis,' has
been submitted for any government approval,'' Tokunaga said.
   The Ohbayashi building would be able to accommodate 300,000
people. Aside from office space and residential units, it also
would have space for hotels, hospitals, parks and convention
centers.
   The design envisions elevators that would reach the top floor in
15 minutes.
   The building is shaped like a triangle, becoming smaller at the
top to help it absorb shock waves. It would have a number of
tunnels to let typhoon winds pass through rather than hitting the
building with full force.
   The Japanese archipelago, in the world's most active seismic
zone, is hit each year by some 1,000 tremors strong enough to be
felt. Three times this century, in 1923, 1946 and 1948, quake
deaths have climbed into the thousands. The Great Kanto Earthquake
of 1923 leveled vast areas of Tokyo and Yokohama, killing 140,000
people.
   About 25 typhoons develop in the region annually.
   In the early 1960s, Japan developed a technique of building
flexible structures to replace the rigid construction techniques
favored for decades.
   Under the old concept, engineers built structures of up to 11
stories, using ferroconcrete solid pillars and walls to absorb
shock and sustain the building's weight. The new concept called for
making walls of slabs of reinforced concrete with several slits on
the surface.
   Using the new method, Tokyo's 36-story, 482-foot-tall
Kasumigaseki Building was completed in 1968.
   Tokyo has about 200 buildings of 12 stories or more, all erected
since 1963.

<HEAD>Deng Ends Official Career With Compromise on Succession</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The end of Deng Xiaoping's official career leaves
China without a paramount leader for the first time since he rose
from disgrace after Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution to
undisputed power a decade ago.
   Deng, 85, announced at a Communist Party meeting Thursday he is
leaving his last party post, chairman of the powerful party Central
Military Commission. He also will resign soon as head of the state
military commission, a job with overlapping functions.
   His departure was accompanied by a carefully crafted compromise
that bolsters, at least for now, the political stature of Deng's
appointed successor, new party chief Jiang Zemin.
   Jiang, 63, was named to succeed Deng on the military commission,
a vital post in a nation where the army wields considerable
political clout. His rival for the job, hard-line President Yang
Shangkun, becomes first vice chairman.
   In another concession to Yang, a mastermind of the June army
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, his younger brother Yang
Baibing, an army political commissar, was appointed
secretary-general of the military commission.
   Although Deng described Jiang, a former Shanghai party boss with
a weak power base in Beijing, as the ``nucleus'' of the new
leadership generation, many believe the party leader's political
fortunes are inextricably tied to Deng's physical health.
   Deng is certain to remain the ultimate authority as long as he
remains healthy, and will protect Jiang, an economic moderate and
political conservative.
   A diplomat in Hong Kong said, however, that if Deng dies, Jiang
``has no chance.''
   He said Jiang's new post on the military commission, together
with the promotion of Yang's brother, ``looks like a compromise''
but ``nothing's been really resolved. There is no clear sign one
way or the other.''
   In a power struggle likely to follow Deng's death, Jiang could
be trapped between the conservatives, led by Yang and Premier Li
Peng, and the reform camp, now in retreat but capable of a comeback.
   One indication the reformers are not yet out was the failure of
the party meeting to condemn Zhao Ziyang, the reform-minded party
leader who was purged in June after being accused of supporting the
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   There had been speculation the party would recommend criminal
charges against Zhao, who has been under house arrest since the
crackdown. The lack of further criticism indicates he still has the
respect of many party leaders, including Deng.
   The paramount leader has nurtured such reformers as Zhao, who
carried out his bold ideas on economic reform, but Deng also has
managed to keep the old ideologues at bay by adopting a
conservative line on political dissent.
   In the past two years, Deng has permitted the dismissal of two
proteges, the late party chief Hu Yaobang and Zhao, to keep his
reforms intact.
   In perhaps his last balancing act, the man Deng has put on the
tightrope this time is Jiang, a relatively obscure politician with
the formidable task of avoiding political disarray while leading a
nation of 1 billion people toward economic prosperity.

<HEAD>Excerpts of Walesa Interview</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Walesa, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Excerpts from interview with Lech Walesa,
as translated from Polish by The Associated Press:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ On the situation in Poland:
   Now we strive for economic pluralism. That is the most difficult
one. We are living in the jungle of the East. The jungle of
bureaucracy. Terrible regulations. Abnormal attitudes. Lack of
competence. So it is the jungle of the East. We need Columbuses
from the States and others to come to discover Poland, to clear the
trail. As Columbus smoothed the way into America, those Columbuses
should blaze the trail to Poland. ...
   Just look through this window. Gdansk has not been repainted in
45 years. Two-thirds of this city are slums, as in all of Poland.
Two-thirds should be demolished and rebuilt. All the cars should be
replaced. They shouldn't be used. So, in America? Where is there
business opportunity, there or here? But first clear the trail,
clear it like Columbus. And then there will an influx of
millionaires. Because there is business to be done here.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ On his trip to the United States:
   Any trip to the States shorter than one month is no good. It
should be only one day or at least one month. And if I am going for
five days, it is neither this nor that. There will be many people
who I will insult, many will be discouraged. And I will disappoint
many people. Because they deserve a talk, I should meet them. How
can I choose who and whom? It is impossible. This program (for the
visit) is bad, but it is impossible to make up a good one. We
cannot make a good program. So that is why I will disappoint many.
And that is why it is not a good trip and a trip which is dangerous
for me. I cannot satisfy Americans in such a short time. I cannot
thank Americans enough, because it is physically impossible. That
is why it is so hard.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ On how he makes decisions:
   I just calculate. I set up my mind and it works like a computer.
It calculates everything. And it just chooses. So far it is not too
bad. But I don't know. I am getting older. But I am trying to save
myself. I am doing calisthenics now because I am starting to feel
exhausted. Maybe I weigh too much. Just to stretch it out, I
started wearing blue jeans, pretending I am 18 years old. I do
sports to extend my life. I don't know if it is going to work.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ On his life:
   I don't like what I am doing. I was born as a free man. And now
what's offered me is slavery. Just look, now BOR (the Government
Protection Office) is sitting on my tail. I don't want it. I did
not want it. But I cannot throw them out, that would be breaking
the law. Someone decided that they should be there (guarding me.)
And all of this makes me a slave. I am fighting for freedom. I have
been fighting for Saturdays off. And I don't even have Sundays off.
I am supposed to be free, and as it turns out I felt better when I
was a prisoner than I do now that I am free. Then I could lay down
and rest. And now it's like being under arrest even at home. I
cannot even walk outside. Somebody is immediately on me. They see
me everywhere. And so time is running out. I want to live a little,
and I don't know if it is possible anymore.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ On whether he will be president of Poland:
   No, no, in all likelihood I will not be. But, then, that is only
what I am saying today. Unless it is very easy, everything settled
in advance, and I will in fact be there only symbolically, and to
be free, and to get the health insurance, so I can go to the doctor.
   But if it is going to be as hard plowing as it is now, then I
don't want to be president. I want to be president only in order to
rest. But if there is any work, then I don't want it.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ On his influence on the government:
   No, I don't have it and I don't want to have it. I have been
building and I am building political pluralism. And if there is an
elected government, it should do its own work. The last time, I
allowed myself to be used, manipulated into posing for pictures
(with all the Solidarity candidates) for the elections. That was
the last time. I will not allow that again. It (politics) should be
based on a program. If I have been criticizing this government, and
I have done it a few times, it is for not speeding up completion of
political pluralism. That makes it difficult to create new and
better programs. I don't criticize them for other things because
they are new, they are learning. But it must complete political
reforms, and the sooner the better.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ On Solidarity's influence:
   Today, we are building things and pluralism, and there is no one
else to build them. And tomorrow, we will make demands, just like
other unions, and we will be not loved, just like other unions
aren't. And maybe we should not be called Solidarity anymore.
   We needed Solidarity to fight for reforms, to unite us, and to
share the burden. But later on in our work, we should take down
this banner, fold it, preserve it, and put it in a trunk so that
our children, when things get bad again, can take it out and fight
against us.
   That is what I think. But will democracy allow me to do it?
Because what we are building is against us. Because I should be
striving so that everything is (controlled by) Solidarity _ the
party, the government, the economy _ everything Solidarity, led by
Walesa. But that is not what it's all about. I cannot replace one
monopoly with another one. So whatever I build, it will be against
me. Because pluralism and democracry are guided by their own rules.
It takes some ideas away. And it is pushing me and us more and more
to the side. It is tough, but that is how it has to be.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ On whether the Communist system is finished:
   A long time ago. But it all depends on what we understand by
``communism.'' If you understand the monopoly of one party,
monopoly over everything, then that has been over for a long time.
It cannot be maintained. But certain slogans in different
conditions can still do a lot of things, and they may be very
popular. But there can be no limitation of freedom and pluralism
anymore. If communism corrects these two things and a few other
minor things, then it will not be entirely a stupid ideology
someday, when people forget about all its sins.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ On criticism of his accepting a government-issued Lancia car
and driver:
   Yes, but it is not important to me. I am supposed to fight with
my arguments and my program and I can bring this program faster in
a Lancia. And I will make it much faster than I would on a bicycle.
... I don't really want it, but I have been using it because I
would be stupid not to. My stomach aches when I am in a Syrenka (an
old model car) because of the vibrations. The vibrations don't suit
me.

<HEAD>NATO Divided on How to Respond to Communist Changes: Crowe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rapid and radical change in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe has divided NATO and could lead to a looser
alliance in the next decade, the former chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff said Thursday.
   ``The picture today is muddier than I've seen it in my 25 years
of experience with NATO,'' Retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. said
at a congressional Joint Economic Committee hearing on future
national security needs.
   Crowe said the Western alliance is sharply split between
cautious response and the desire of some to undertake ``headlong
reductions'' in military might. U.S. efforts to spread defense
costs more equitably among alliance members will likely have little
effect, he said.
   ``The countries of Western Europe are going to spend less on
defense no matter what we do,'' Crowe told the panel. ``Ultimately,
NATO will probably remold itself into a looser arrangement,
probably with reduced U.S. participation.''
   Such an outcome also would reduce American influence over
European affairs, Crowe said.
   The rapid restructuring occurring in the Soviet Union and the
political and economic reforms it has touched off in countries such
as Poland and Hungary ``are stunning,'' said Crowe, who retired
last month as the nation's top military officer.
   ``I never thought it would happen in my lifetime.''
   It's too early to say what impact the changes will have on
U.S.-Soviet relations, Crowe said, calling the situation ``a very
uncertain strategic transition. ... The future ain't what it used
to be.''
   U.S. planners should be ``very cautious'' about making any
sudden cut in military spending, he said.
   ``We should use the first rule of wing walking,'' said Crowe,
referring to the barnstorming acrobats of decades past: ``Never let
go of something until you've got ahold of something else.''
   Crowe said it was too soon to pronounce the Cold War over, but
said it could happen if the United States and the Soviet Union
reach arms control agreements on strategic nuclear weapons and
conventional forces in Europe.
   But even if those trends play out successfully, he said, the
Soviets will still have a 4 million member military force.
   ``We have to fashion some kind of security relationship with the
Soviet Union,'' he said.
   As such a relationship is forged, regional instabilities around
the world will assume a greater role in U.S. calculations of
security needs, he said, mentioning the Persian Gulf, the Middle
East and Latin America.

<HEAD>Galileo Makes its First Course Correction En Route to Jupiter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Galileo fired its thrusters today to
start the first of about 30 course corrections the craft will make
during its six-year, 2.4-billion-mile journey to Jupiter.
   ``So far everything is going just fine,'' said Neal Ausman,
Galileo mission director at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   During the three-day maneuver, which started at 8:31 a.m. PST,
Galileo will fire its thrusters in pulses of no more than two
minutes each.
   The maneuver is meant to aim Galileo for its flight past Venus
in February. The spacecraft will swoop by Venus once and Earth
twice so the planets can act as ``gravity slingshots'' to propel
Galileo toward Jupiter during the $1.9 billion mission.
   Galileo was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18.
   In 1995, it will separate into an orbiter and a probe. The
orbiter will circle Jupiter for 22 months, and the probe will

million miles from Venus. It was traveling at 60,376 mph relative

   Virginia Romero took one look inside
the army tent at the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds and walked back
out.
   ``Thank you, but the ones over there seem very isolated, and in
my personal opinion I say no,'' she told Red Cross worker Ray
Sanchez.
   ``It's too cold here, and sometimes I work until three o'clock
in the morning. I'd have no place to keep my children,'' said Marlso declining
Sanchez's invitation to move from their
informal tent camp in town to the Red Cross shelter three miles up
Routeia
Hernandez, a 152.
   The other six people Sanchez brought from the quake victims'
camp at Callaghan Park to see the shelter also said no.
   Too far from work, one said. No privacy inside the fairgrounds
gym, said another. Too cold in the tents scattered across the
grounds, said a third.
   ``It's their prerogative,'' Sanchez said. ``I'd like to see them
come out here, but I'm in no position to force them.''
   Their refusal highlighted the challenges relief workers and city
officials face in trying to provide for an estimated 480 people in
this largely Hispanic city still displaced from the Oct. 17 quake.
   About 150 of them have refused to leave their informal tent city
in Callaghan Park, distrustful of authorities, div for meals.
   ``Unfortunately, the first night he served corned beef and
cabbage,'' said Loretta Nestor, a shelter supervisor. Relief
workers are soliciting donations from vendors of Latin American
foods.
   Meanwhile, families of five or more people to a tent make do at
the park, cooking over donated barbecues and eating at a long
picnic table on the basketball court. The nearest shower is at the
YMCA two blocks away.
   Mrs. Hernandez, who works at a cannery, spoke briefly with some
residents at the fairgrounds shelter before calling her 2-year-old
daughter and going back to Callaghan.
   ``There's more privacy, and we are taking care of each other
there,'' she said.
   ``I'm going to keep trying,'' sighed Red Cross worker Sanchez.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Arthur Ravenel Jr. today
dismissed speculation he is quitting the GOP for the Democratic
Party.
   ``If I was going to switch parties, I would hold a press
conference and I would tell the people at home I was switching
parties and why,'' the lawmaker said. ``I wouldn't make a switch
unless I had a compelling reason.''
   The State newspaper in Columbia today quoted unidentified
sources as saying the 62-year-old, two-term congressman feels out
of step with the Republicans and is considering becoming a Democrat
but wants assurances he can keep his committee assignments.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press from his
Washington office today, Ravenel said he is frustrated because he
has been unable to obtain a seat on the Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee. He called the appointment ``extremely
important to the health and wealth'' of his district.
   Ravenel said if he is rebuffed in his effort to get on the
committee, ``certainly I would consider my options.''
   He declined to say what those options might be, but when asked
if they would include defecting to the Democratic Party, he said:
``I wouldn't go that far.''
   In an interview earlier this week, Ravenel, whose coastal
district includes Hilton Head, Beaufort and Charleston and was
battered by Hurricane Hugo in September, expressed disenchantment
with the GOP, The State reported.
   He said he had been criticized by conservatives in South
Carolina for his recent support of funding for abortion in cases of
incest or rape and for backing some spending measures.
   ``I'm just not a right-winger. I'm a moderate, and it just
drives some of the Republicans back home up the wall,'' Ravenel was
quoted as saying. ``I could just as easily be a Democrat as a
Republican.''
   But Ravenel said today those comments were ``a lot of old stuff
I've been saying for a long time.''
   The congressman said that he draws on support from Democrats as
well as Republicans at election time. His district had been
historically Democratic before it went for Ronald Reagan in 1980.
   If Ravenel switched parties, it would be a coup for the
Democrats, in part because it would happen in GOP National
Committee Chairman Lee Atwater's backyard.
   A switch by Ravenel also would come on the heels of the
Democrats' sweep of Tuesday's major elections in New Jersey,
Virginia and New York City.

<HEAD>Americans Hold Unusual Abortion Protest in Soviet Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two dozen Americans held posters, lighted candles
and heard speeches outside the U.S. Embassy in a protest of the
U.S. government's abortion policy that drew puzzled looks and
laughter from Soviet passersby.
   ``It's incomprehensible! It's absurd!'' one elderly woman said
after stopping to read a poster that said in Russian, ``Return my
Body!''
   The Americans, who are studying Russian or working in Moscow,
called the demonstration in advance of more than 1,000 rallies and
other events by abortion rights activists in 150 U.S. cities
scheduled Sunday.
   The protesters assembled on the sidewalk outside the embassy's
main entrance, an area crammed with Armenians and Jews who want to
emigrate to the United States. The timing of the protest, during
the evening rush hour, also drew curious passersby.
   One woman stopped to ask what the protest was about and when
told it concerned restrictions on abortions in the United States,
she said with a laugh and smile, ``Come to us. We'll do it.''
   Abortion is the primary form of birth control in the Soviet
Union and each woman has an average of nine abortions.
   One speaker said that like Americans, Soviet women have been
deprived of the choice to have an abortion. Here, the woman said,
Soviets must have abortions because they have no contraceptives.
   Soviet police guarding the embassy entrance watched without
trying to stop the protest.
   Laurie Essig, 24, a protester who studies at the Pushkin Russian
Language Institute, said the rally was held outside the U.S.
Embassy so government representatives inside could see the
opposition to the Bush administration's abortion policies.
   With demonstrations common in Moscow on issues ranging from
democracy to emigration, one woman remarked after stopping by the
abortion protest, ``It's become so interesting here! You never get
bored.''

<TEXT>
   A trial judge who accused an attorney
of crying to win a jury's sympathy was justified in erasing a $1
million judgment in a slip-and-fall case, an appeals court found.
   A jury in Pensacola returned the verdict against the Winn-Dixie
supermarket chain last year in a lawsuit filed by Jim Allen Nash
and his wife, Janice, over injuries suffered in a 1986 fall at the
Winn-Dixie store in Gulf Breeze.
   A three-judge panel of the 1st District Court of Appeal on
Wednesday upheld Circuit Judge Joseph Tarbuck's decision to throw
out the verdict.
   ``In particular, we note that the amount of the verdict cannot
be sustained by any view of the evidence and apparently resulted
from the jury being improperly influenced by passion or
prejudice,'' the appeal court concluded.
   Tarbuck said crying by lawyer Lefferts Mabie, who denied
shedding tears during his closing argument, was one reason for his
decision.
   Mabie submitted sworn statements from all six jurors saying they
didn't see him cry, and he again denied the allegation Thursday.
Mabie said he will ask the appeals court to reconsider its decision
and, if that fails, the case will be retried.

<HEAD>House Panel Expands Farm Aid to Include Earthquake Damages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Agriculture Committee on Thursday
extended farm disaster aid to cover crops and agriculture-related
businesses damaged by the California earthquake last month.
   The bill now goes to the full House for a vote, which the
committee chairman, Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, said he would
try to expedite.
   Orchards, ornamental trees and speciality crops are an important
part of the agricultural economy in the Northern California area
where the earthquake hit.
   The tremor rocked greenhouses, shook fruit from trees, damaged
wineries and caused food processing plants to shut down during
mid-harvest.
   ``Unfortunately, too many agriculture businesses slip through
the safety net that our nation's disaster programs are supposed to
provide,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., who offered the
amendment to the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989.
   ``Congress needs to take steps to ensure that those not
currently eligible are not unfairly denied the assistance they need
to get back on their feet,'' he said.
   The legislation requires:
   _Reimbursement of 65 percent of the cost of replanting trees and
seedlings that were lost.
   _The agriculture secretary to guarantee loans made in rural
areas to public, private, cooperative organizations or Indian
tribes whose agricultural operations were damaged.
   _Increase from $200 million to $300 million the total amount of
loans that may be guaranteed.

<HEAD>Air Raid Shelter, Ships Latest Ideas to House Refugees</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials Thursday hunted for
every available space, including ships and an air raid shelter, to
house the deluge of East German refugees heading into West Germany.
   ``The chaos is growing larger and larger,'' said Hermann
Heinemann, the social services minister of North Rhine-Westphalia
state.
   The West German government issued a caution to any more East
Germans planning to join the flow of more than 200,000 who have
headed West this year.
   ``Every refugee must figure that he will have to live in
inadequate housing for a fairly long time, and will probably be
living much worse than if he had stayed home,'' said Interior
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble.
   But Schaeuble, in a speech to Parliament, said the federal
government has no intention of turning back any East Germans.
   Amusement parks and vacation apartments are next on the list in
West Germany for possible emergency shelters, which already have
been set up in military barracks, camping places and gymnasiums.
Refugees also are being housed in hotels temporarily.
   The Shell oil company said it was making available the
administration building of a closed plant in the town of Monheim
along the Rhine River to provide temporary shelter for 100 refugees.
   Most of the East Germans stay in the shelters or hotels until
they can move in with relatives or find an apartment in an
increasingly tight and costly rental market.
   There have been increasing predictions of difficulties in
absorbing the newcomers.
   But opposition leader Hans-Jochen Vogel said it would be
erroneous for ``orthodox'' Communists in East Berlin to think they
could spark a right-wing backlash in West Germany by encouraging
the exodus.
   Compounding the housing difficulties are the 300,000 ethnic
Germans from other parts of Eastern Europe and the 90,000 asyslum
seekers who have reached West Germany so far this year.
   The influx also has created problems in finding jobs, while
strapping social services across the country.
   Heinemann, the North Rhine-Westphalia social services minister,
said the organizational difficulties of handling the East German
refugees ``can hardly be overcome.''
   The social services minister said in Duesseldorf the state
government is hoping to rent eight ships to house 1,000 East German
refugees each, while amusement parks and vacation apartments were
also being targeted.
   In the port of Bremen, social services director Hans-Christoph
Hoppensack said city officials would set up a temporary shelter in
an underground air raid shelter.
   Hoppensack said the East German refugees would move in within
the next few days, but declined to outline specifics.
   Hanover Mayor Herbert Schmalstieg, who also serves as the
president of West Germany's league of cities, warned that local
authorities nationwide would soon be unable to accept either East
German refugees or ethnic Germans.
   ``Hanover may soon be forced to take this step,'' Schmalstieg
told reporters on Thursday.
   But in the southern city of Munich, officials had another idea.
   Police say they would like to hear from any refugees who were
members of the Volkspolizei, the East German police force.
   Munich police say they would be happy to consider signing up the
former Vopos, as they are called, to switch uniforms and start
patroling the streets of the Bavarian capital.

<HEAD>Two Soviets Defect During Visit to Milwaukee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Soviet men who came to town to see the
unveiling of a Russian mural have defected.
   ``We have received two asylum applications from Soviet citizens.
Those applications are pending,'' Ronald B. Swan, officer in charge
of Immigration and Naturalization Service in Milwaukee, said
Wednesday.
   He declined to identify the men but said they defected late last
week.
   They will be allowed to stay in the United States pending a
review of their applications, which could take weeks, Swan said.
   The baked clay mural, brought here as part of an art exchange
program, was unveiled last week at the Milwaukee Art Museum.
   The two men who defected were not part of the delegation of
artists and musicians who arrived here by ship with the Russian
mural, said Jim Ohlschmidt, a Milwaukee participant in the
US-Soviet exchange.
   The men flew here for the unveiling at the invitation of two
women, Ohlschmidt said.
   The men had played host to the women when a delegation from
Milwaukee presented a mural to the residents of Leningrad in July,
and the women were returning the favor, officials said.
   ``We had no idea this was going to happen. It took us by
complete surprise,'' Ohlschmidt said.
   Joel Pfeiffer, organizer of the art exchange, was quick to
distance the men from the project.
   ``They are two grown men who made a choice,'' Pfeiffer said.
``They were not part of the project. It should have absolutely no
effect on the project.''

<HEAD>Health Officials Confirm More Cases of Legionnaires' Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least six people who attended a high school
reunion at a motel in September have contracted Legionnaires'
disease and two died, health officials said today.
   The six cases were among 17 people who came down with
pneumonia-like symptoms after the gathering at the Best Western Cow
Palace Inn in Lamar.
   Health Department spokesman Ann Lockhart said the department is
awaiting lab results but that all 17 cases are believed to involve
Legionnaires' disease.
   Three of those stricken have died, two of them with confirmed
cases of Legionnaires'. The four others with confirmed
Legionnaires' cases recovered.
   Two other persons got the disease after staying at the motel
prior to the reunion Sept. 22-24. However, health department
officials today said they did not include those cases in the 17
because they cannot be directly linked to the motel.
   Legionnaires' is believed to be caused by bacteria that are
found in soil and grow in water, favoring such places as air
conditioning ducts, storage tanks and rivers.
   The disease takes its name from an outbreak at a Pennsylvania
American Legion convention held at a Philadelphia hotal in 1976.
Thirty-four people died in that outbreak.
   Epidemiologists took air and water samples from guest rooms and
common areas of the Cow Palace last weekend. Results are expected
next week, said Lockhart.
   Health Department officials are giving a questionnaire and blood
test to motel employees.

<HEAD>Vatican, Soviet Cooperate on Exhibit of Russian Icons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Vatican is holding the first exhibit of
Russian religious icons outside the Soviet Union in what a Soviet
official Thursday described as a sign of the rapprochement between
Moscow and the Holy See.
   Pope John Paul II will inaugurate the exhibit Friday, three
weeks before his scheduled meeting with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the first between supreme leaders of the Vatican and
Kremlin.
   The exhibit of 107 medieval icons, seven ancient Russian
embroideries and three sculptures was presented to reporters
Thursday by officials of the Vatican Museums and J.S. Melentev,
minister of culture for the Russian republic.
   ``We consider this exhibit a concrete step on the road to
greater mutual understanding'' with the Vatican, Melentev said.
   To underline the improved ties, he read the text of a Nov. 4
Soviet Politburo communique, which he said would have been
``unthinkable one or two years ago,'' approving the Oct. 20 meeting
in Moscow between Gorbachev and a top Vatican foreign ministry
official, Archbishop Angelo Sodano.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to meet with the pope at the Vatican
during his Nov. 29-Dec. 1 visit to Italy. John Paul has often
expressed the wish to visit his flock in the Soviet Union, and
church officials say the talks with Gorbachev could clear the way
for such a trip.
   Melentev, who will present the exhibit to the pope Friday, said
he hopes a papal visit to the Soviet Union can take place ``in the
not too distant future.''
   The minister's speech was filled with comments indicative of the
more open attitude toward religion in the officially atheist Soviet
Union. He spoke of the country's spiritual roots, the improvement
in East-West relations, and Gorbachev's vision of a ``common
European home.''
   ``We are on the threshold of a new era, the third millennium
since the birth of Christ. ... In the name of this fragile common
home, people are ready to abandon old stereotypes and ways of
thinking,'' Melentev said.
   He quoted a phrase from author Rudyard Kipling _ ``Oh, East is
East and West is West and never the twain shall meet'' _ and said:
   ``Kipling probably made a mistake. Because now it is necessary
for East and West to meet and find a common path. Step by step, not
only states and governments, but all people are moving in this
direction. We should get used to this.''
   Melentev even quoted from the Bible: ``A time to scatter stones,
and a time to gather.''
   The minister also linked last year's 1,000 anniversary of the
introduction of Christianity in what is now the Soviet Union with
Tuesday's ceremonies marking the 72nd anniversary of the Bolshevik
Revolution.
   ``Celebrating the millennium we realized that the October
Revolution was a rupture in our history, and we wouldn't want there
to be a rutpure with our great cultural and spiritual heritage,''
he said.
   The exhibit, at the Braccio de Carlo Magno in St. Peter's
Square, opens to the public on Saturday and runs through Jan. 30.
   Many of the precious works, dating from the 13th to the 18th
century and displayed in various Soviet museums, were restored in
Moscow's Grabar Center.
   The icons represent faces of Christ, the Madonna and child,
saints and scenes of Christmas and other religious celebrations.

   Although he gave up most official titles in
recent years, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping retained ultimate
power and fashioned a decade of economic reform.
   Deng, 85, resigned Thursday from his last formal Communist Party
post, head of the Central Military Commission _ an action delayed,
according to reports, by the pro-democracy movement crushed in June.
   Reports indicated Deng had hoped to step down after the visit in
May of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The end of a 30-year
estrangement between the Communist giants would have been the
crowning achievement of Deng's career.
   The student-led demonstrations for democracy overshadowed the
Gorbachev visit, however, and led to the bloody military crackdown.
   At least among educated Chinese, Deng is likely to be remembered
more as the hard-liner who ordered the army to suppress the
democracy movement than as the reformer who created economic
modernization.
   Deng was born Aug. 22, 1904, as Kan Zegao, son of a wealthy
landowner in southwest Sichuan province, and changed his name when
he joined the Communist Party more than six decades ago.
   He was purged and rehabilitated three times. After one purge, he
was jailed, called a ``capitalist roader'' and paraded through
Beijing wearing a dunce cap.
   In 1978, at age 74, he won the power struggle that followed the
death two years earlier of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
   Under Deng, China established normal relations with the United
States, worked out agreements to regain Hong Kong and Macao, and
achieved an unprecedented relaxation of tensions with Taiwan, seat
of the rival Nationalist government.
   He reduced the bloated People's Liberation Army by 1 million
men, cut military spending and presided over the first codification
of civil and criminal law.
   The economy grew enormously under Deng's stewardship. Central
controls were eased and foreign capital flooded in, but rapid
growth created inflation and bribery became commonplace.
   Political corruption spread and Deng was linked to it through
his son, Deng Pufang, who was associated with a company accused of
tax evasion and other questionable practices.
   Outrage over corruption by bureaucrats and party functionaries
culminated in the student-led protests that began in April.
Workers, intellectuals and pensioners joined in, often chanting,
``Xiaoping, step down!''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Smithsonian Institution opened a $2.7
million visitors' center Thursday that boasts high-tech computer
displays in the same historic Castle building where Abraham Lincoln
observed hot-air balloon maneuvers during the Civil War.
   Electronic wall maps, touch screen video displays in seven
languages, two movie theaters and scale models of Washington's
downtown tourist attractions _ including one with Braille captions
_ will greet the 3 million visitors who are expected to use the new
Smithsonian Information Center next year.
   One stop at the Victorian-style Castle's great hall, said
Assistant Smithsonian Secretary Ralph Rinzler, ``will help visitors
make the best use of their time at the museums and save them the
frustration of an endless trek from building to building.''
   The Smithsonian has expanded greatly since 1855, when the Castle
was built to house its early scientific collections. Today the
Smithsonian includes 14 museums and galleries, plus the National
Zoo, which attracted 28 million visits last year.
   At the newly renovated ground floor of the Castle, cherrywood
kiosks contain 13 video screens giving tourists detailed
information and travel directions to Smithsonian attractions and
scores of other Washington landmarks.
   Volunteers are available to answer such frequent questions as
``Where is the Wright brothers' plane?'' (in the National Air and
Space Museum) or ``How much is the Hope diamond worth?'' (it's
priceless).
   New ramp entrances at the east and west wings of the building
are designed to accommodate wheelchairs and baby strollers.
Restrooms include diaper-changing facilities.
   In addition, the former Children's Room at the south entrance,
closed nearly a half-century ago to make room for offices, was
restored and reopened to the public Thursday as a lounge.
   Decorated with wall stencils, peacock feathers and ceiling
paintings, the vaulted room resembles its appearance in 1901, when
it was installed with stuffed birds and aquariums of special
interest to children.
   The two-year renovation of the ground floor of the red sandstone
Castle, whose towers, gables and battlements are a familiar sight
on the National Mall, was privately financed by donations from
individuals and several foundations.
   The Castle is a National Historic Landmark whose upper floors
house the offices of Robert McC. Adams, the secretary of the
Smithsonian, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars. It also contains the crypt of James Smithson, the
eccentric English scientist who bequeathed his estate of $515,169
in gold sovereigns to establish the institution in his name.
   The Castle originally provided living quarters for the
Smithsonian's first secretary, Joseph Henry, and his family, and
once served as home for bachelor curators, visiting scientists and
a 30-foot dinosaur skeleton. Its visitors have included Britain's
Queen Elizabeth II, Pope John Paul II and Lincoln, who observed
Union Army reconnaissance balloons from the Castle's main tower.

   The Democratic-controlled House today approved
a $305 billion defense bill that slashes $1.1 billion from
President Bush's spending request for the Strategic Defense
Initiative in fiscal 1990.
   By a vote of 236-172, lawmakers approved legislation that
provides much of Bush's request for land-based nuclear missiles and
restores some funds for two conventional-arms programs the
president sought to kill.
   The bill provides $3.8 billion for SDI, also known as Star Wars,
in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 _ about $279 million less than
the amount spent in fiscal 1989.
   The spending level represents the first reduction in the SDI
program in its six-year history.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said this budget represents the ``last deficit-driven
defense budget. What we're likely to face next year is the first in
a series of (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev-driven defense
budgets.''
   But Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., said reductions in the U.S.
defense budget in response to efforts toward democracy in Eastern
Europe should occur this year.
   ``The Warsaw Pact is crumbling before our eyes and we're
building weapons of destruction,'' said Dellums, a member of the
House Armed Services panel.
   The legislation, which still must be approved by the Senate,
includes approximately $1.1 billion for the rail-based MX
multiple-warhead missile and the truck-based Midgetman
single-warhead missile, about $150 million less than Bush had
requested for the two nuclear weapons.
   The bill also includes House language imposing a 50-missile cap
on the MX.
   The bill provides $4.3 billion for the B-2 stealth bomber
program _ $430 million less than the adminstration requested. It
provides money for the purchase of two stealth bombers in fiscal
1990 and components for five of the bat-winged aircraft in fiscal
1991.
   The legislation restores some money for the two
conventional-arms programs Bush sought to cancel _ the Marine Corps
Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Navy's F-14D Tomcat.
   The Osprey, an aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but can
fly like a plane, will receive about $255 million in research and
development money but no funds for procurement. The future of the
program would be tied to commercial use of the plane.
   The legislation also includes a provision calling for the
purchase of 18 F-14D fighters in fiscal 1990. However, the bill
requires the manufacturer of the F-14D, Grumman Corp., of New York,
to sign a contract to end future production of the plane.

   A coalition of national health groups launched
a campaign Thursday to raise awareness of glaucoma, especially
among blacks for whom the disease is the leading cause of blindness.
   Glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness among
Americans overall after diabetic retinopathy, but blacks are four
to six times as likely to get the disease as whites, medical
experts said at a news conference.
   ``Awareness is essential because glaucoma has few, if any, early
symptoms and if it is detected early blindness can be prevented,''
said Dr. Roger Mason, an associate professor at the Howard
University School of Medicine.
   An estimated 2 million Americans have glaucoma; at least 1
million have lost some sight and 80,000 are blind because of it.
   The National Society to Prevent Blindness announced a new effort
to reduce blindness from glaucoma by focusing screening and public
education on high-risk groups. The program will try to get
physicians to identify those at risk and refer them for complete
eye exams.
   Congress designated Nov. 12-18 as National Glaucoma Awareness
Week.
   Blacks, the elderly, diabetics, people who are nearsighted and
those with a family history of glaucoma are at high risk for
developing the disease, caused by a buildup of fluid pressure
inside the eye. The fluid buildup eventually damages nerve cells in
the eye.
   A recent Gallup survey found that a majority of adults
incorrectly believe that a feeling of pressure in the eyes is a
sign of glaucoma and that eye damage from the disease can be
corrected.
   Medical experts say that when detected early, the disease
usually can be controlled and vision loss prevented with drugs in
the form of eye drops, laser treatment or surgery. However,
whatever vision is lost cannot be restored.
   The disease usually has no early warning signs, though it
sometimes causes loss of side vision, difficulty in adjusting eyes
to the dark and a frequent need for new glasses. In its later
stages, glaucoma can cause eye pain, blurred vision, seeing halos
around lights, nausea and vomiting.
   Mason said a study he conducted found glaucoma occurs in blacks
at four to five times the rate in whites, while a survey by Dr.
Harry Quigley of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine found
the rate as much as six times as high in blacks.
   Neither study identified the reason blacks are at higher risk
than whites.
   Mason said the best way to detect glaucoma is through a
comprehensive eye exam. Measuring fluid pressure in the eye _ the
most common test used in glaucoma screening _ doesn't always detect
the disease, he said.
   The coalition launching the campaign includes the National Eye
Institute, National Council on the Aging, National Medical
Association, American Diabetes Association, Lions Club
International and Lighthouse.

   California's Board of Education today
bowed to Christian fundamentalists and unanimously adopted new
guidelines on the teaching of evolution that take note of the
theory of creation.
   The board voted 9-0 to approve the guidelines for science
textbooks in the biggest school system in the nation, with 4.6
million students.
   The old guidelines said evolution must be taught in schools, and
they offered no guidance to teachers or administrators on dealing
with questions from students about the biblical theory of creation.
   As a result of today's vote, the new guidelines hold that ``some
people reject the theory of evolution purely on the basis of
religious faith'' and that such ``personal beliefs should be
respected and not demeaned.''
   However, the new document, unlike the old, gives evolution a
central place in science education, arguing in detail the
importance of teaching evolution.
   ``It's very clear in the document that evolution will be taught
and creationism will not,'' said Bill Honig, state superintendent
of instruction.
   The board has been at the center of a struggle with national
implications that pits religious groups against science teachers
and administrators who say the theory of evolution is no more
controversial than gravity or electricity.
   In 1985, California education authorities successfully demanded
that publishers devote more space to evolution, and those revised
textbooks are now being used in schools across the country.
   In September, the original guidelines were declared a ``national
victory for science over dogma'' by Micheal Hudson, Western states
director for the Washington-based People for the American Way, a
civil liberties group.
   The Board of Education voted on the guidelines after they were
amended Wednesday by the board's Policy and Planning Commission.
   Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for
Science Education, said the policy adopted by the commission was
``slightly weaker'' on evolution than a draft prepared in September
by a state panel.
   ``It's a concession to board members who are knuckling under to
right-wing religious pressure,'' Scott said.
   Honig said the wording was changed from an earlier draft to make
it less offensive to those who believe God created the universe.
   Specifically, a sentence was struck that read: ``There is no
scientific dispute that evolution has occurred and continues to
occur; this is why evolution is regarded as a scientific fact.''
   The Rev. Louis Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition said
creation theory supporters were given ``crumbs from the table'' in
the amendments.
   Evolution may no longer be called fact directly in the document,
``but it says that in other ways,'' he said.
   The guidelines provide a detailed explanation of how science
should be taught in California schools. The framework does not
mandate course content, which is determined by local school boards,
but sets standards and goals, and influences textbook publishers.

   Calling discrimination against AIDS patients
``absolutely unacceptable,'' Secretary of Health and Human Services
Louis Sullivan issued a new call Thursday for anti-discrimination
legislation.
   Sullivan, speaking at a conference on AIDS and minorities, said
the Bush administration is committed to seeing acquired immune
deficiency syndrome covered under legislation pending in Congress,
the Americans With Disabilities Act.
   ``This administration is committed to enacting legislation to
prohibit such discrimination,'' he said.
   Sullivan said AIDS has become a ``special problem'' of the
nation's poor and minorities, but added, ``This sort of
us-versus-them thinking _ this is dangerous.''
   The secretary was on friendly turf at the conference, which was
sponsored by the Morehouse School of Medicine. Sullivan, an alumnus
of Morehouse College, was founding president of the medical school
before he was appointed to the Cabinet by President Bush.
   Sullivan said part of the onus of stopping AIDS _ transmitted
chiefly through sex or drug paraphernalia _ rests with individuals,
to ``think and behave in a more constructive way'' with
``moderation, self-control and discipline.''
   He called for a ``new ethic of personal responsibility, a new
culture of character,'' not just for AIDS but for other problems
such as teen pregnancy and homicide. ``It cannot be brought about
by federal mandate,'' he said.
   He also addressed the overload of AIDS patients at medical
facilities from coast to coast.
   ``AIDS has not caused a crisis in our health care system,'' he
said. ``AIDS has simply revealed the pre-existing cracks in the
system.
   ``We have not yet made health care sufficiently available to all
American citizens. ... We must work to put our entire health care
system in order.''

<TEXT>
   The African National Congress, an
anti-apartheid organization outlawed in South Africa, opened an
office here Thursday trying to improve relations with the United
States.
   Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's Director of International Affairs, said
the Washington office would seek to persuade the Bush
administration to impose additional economic sanctions against
South Africa.
   Mbeki told reporters the Bush administration, in marked contrast
to its predecessor, believes the existing sanctions have already
forced the South African government to liberalize its policies
toward the country's black majority.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said recently that
while the administration opposes harsher sanctions at this time, it
would be willing to consider them if no progress is made toward
black-white negotiations in South Africa by next summer.
   Mbeki said the Bush administration differs with its predecessor
on another point. ``Clearly the Bush administration has moved away
from the notion that the South African government must be pacified,
pampered, pleased,'' he said at a news conference.
   While Bush's meetings with prominent anti-apartheid leaders such
as Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Albertina Sisulu are important,
Mbeki said, ``the greatest contribution Bush could and should make
is further sanctions.''
   The sanctions were imposed in 1986 by Congress, after it
overrode a veto by former President Reagan.
   The ANC opened a similar office in Moscow last year, and already
has about 40 representatives abroad, Mbeki said.
   Mbeki, whose father Govan Mbeki was one of seven top ANC
officials released from prison last week after 25 years in
captivity, said the United States appears committed to pushing for
an end to the racial discrimination policies in South Africa.
   He said the ANC had been encouraged by administration officials
to open its office here ``because they know we are central to the
solution of the South African problem.''
   The ANC is concerned the United States may let up pressure on
newly elected President F.W. De Klerk, who has been liberalizing
his government's policies toward blacks but has rejected giving
them the vote and maintains wide powers of arrest and censorship.
   If that turns out to be the case, Mbeki said, ``we have to
resurrect'' the pressure.
   Conservatives in Congress contend the ANC is funded by the
Soviet Union and that its armed wing is supplied by the Soviet
bloc. Mbeki said there would always be ``those who don't like us''
but that the question of Soviet support was ``not an issue'' with
the administration.
   In 1987, then-Secretary of State George Shultz met with ANC
leader Oliver Tambo. Regular meetings have been conducted with the
group's representatives ever since.

   East Germany said today it was opening its borders
to the rest of the world and that its citizens can travel or
emigrate anywhere, including through the 28-year-old Berlin Wall.
   Guenter Schabowski, a member of the ruling Politburo, said that
those who want to visit other countries and then return would still
need a visa, but that the visa requests would be handled without
delay.
   The stunning announcement comes on the heels of a remarkable
series of events that has shaken this once rigidly controlled
Communist nation.
   Earlier today, new leader Egon Krenz and Schabowski both called
for free and democratic elections, the main demand of a widening
opposition movement.
   Earlier this week, Krenz ousted the Politburo and replaced aging
hard-liners with reformers in a desperate move to counter daily
public unrest and the mass flight of tens of thousands of East
Germans to the West.
   Communist leaders also decided today to consider even more
changes in the government hierarchy.The Communist Party's Central
Committee set a party conference for Dec. 15-17.
   A party conference, a forum for making major changes in party
policy, was last held in 1956. The official ADN news agency said
the conference would discuss personnel changes in the 163-member
Central Committee.
   The move to open the borders comes after decades of fencing East
Germans in to prevent their flight to the West. The Berlin Wall has
divided Berlin and the two German nations since 1961.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said free
travel for East Germans would be a ``very positive development''
that the United States would welcome.
   ``We've been talking a long time about freedom of travel being a
basic human right. We've been talking a long time about open
borders. We've been talking a long time about the importance of
seeing the wall come down,'' Baker said.
   Schabowski said those who want to emigrate can go to West
Germany directly without having to go through a third country. More
than 50,000 East Germans have fled through neighboring
Czechoslovakia since Saturday and about 200,000 have fled this year.
   Schabowski told reporters in East Berlin that the decision was
made during a Central Committee meeting. He said the decision means
all East Germans ``can travel over all East German border
checkpoints.''
   While stunning changes have taken place at the top, daily street
protests have continued almost unabated for the last several weeks.
About 40,000 people demonstrated Wednesday night in Neubrandenburg
and near Karl-Marx-Stadt for free elections and an end to
authoritarian one-party rule, ADN said.
   In the first official Soviet comment since Krenz reshuffled the
country's top leadership, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov told a news briefing in Moscow today that it was clear
East Germany was undertaking a ``renewal of socialism.
   ``They're improving the situation in the sense that they're
moving toward perestroika on their own terms,'' he told a news
briefing, referring to the Kremlin's current program of reforms.
   Krenz touched on the volatile topic of multiparty elections in a
speech to the Central Committee that was published today in state
newspapers. He called for a ``new election law that ensures free,
democratic general elections with a secret ballot. ''
   He proposed ``public supervision in every stage of the
balloting.''
   Krenz did not say whether he was urging a true multiparty system
in East Germany. Officials already say elections are democratic,
even though the system guarantees the Communists virtually
unanimous approval.
   Krenz also promised new laws on freedom of assembly, assocation
and the press, but gave no details.
   However, he did say independent groups might have a role in the
nation's politics as East Germany tries to recover from the shock
of losing more than 200,000 mostly young, skilled workers to the
West this year.
   Schabowski said earlier today that the Communists were ready to
go into free elections ``without any limits.''
   ``If we profess free elections here, then we are professing free
elections without any limits and with all risks that are
connected,'' Schabowski told West Germany's Westdeutsche Rundfunk
radio.
   East Germany's pro-democracy opposition groups have made free
elections their main demand, although Krenz has repeatedly said
that any changes can't jeopardize the Communist Party's ``leading
role.'' Party dominance also is embodied in the nation's
constitution and a constitutional change would be required to
abolish it.
   Guenter Hartmann, leader of the small National Democratic party
that previously had closely followed Communist policy, also called
for free elections today. Writing in the party's National Zeitung
newspaper, he questiioned whether the constitutional article that
guarantees the party's leading role ``could still stand.''
   Meanwhile, a group of 15 prominent East Berlin Communist
intellectuals and officials wrote a letter to the Central Committee
suggesting the Berlin Wall be torn down in the near future.
   ``It is also imaginable, even in the foreseeable future, that
the wall will become a relic of the past'' if an agreement is
signed with West Germany that would prevent ``damage to the East
German economy,'' the group said.
   The letter appeared today in the Berliner Zeitung, a newspaper
of the city's Communist Party organization. Among those who signed
it were Heinz Albrecht, secretary for economy with the East Berlin
party leadership, and Rolf Reissig, a member of the Academy of
Social Science of the Central Committee.
   Communist authorities built the Berlin Wall in 1961 to stop an
exodus to West Germany. It became a symbol of the differences
between East and West, differences that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has sought to erase by urging reforms in the Soviet bloc.
   Krenz, who assumed power just three weeks ago, on Wednesday
purged much of the old guard from the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo. The 21-member body was reduced to 11.
   The leadership reshuffle swept aside nine aging Politburo
members and brought in four new ones, including Dresden party chief
Hans Modrow. Seen as a reformer, Modrow was proposed as the new
premier when the 44-person Cabinet resigned en masse Tuesday.

<HEAD>Pentagon: Soviets Suspected of Aiming Lasers at U.S. Aircraft</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials suspect the Soviets of shooting
lasers at American planes in the Pacific recently, damaging the
eyesight of an Air Force crewman in one of four incidents, Pentagon
officials said Thursday.
   An agreement signed last summer by top U.S. and Soviet military
officials is designed to avoid such military encounters, but it
does not go into effect until Jan. 1. Pentagon officials said
privately they were dismayed that such incidents could be
continuing in the meantime.
   At a Pentagon briefing, spokesman Pete Williams said two Soviet
vessels ``may have'' aimed lasers at U.S. aircraft on Oct. 17, Oct.
28 and in two separate incidents on Nov. 1 over waters off Hawaii.
   Asked whether the matter affected U.S.-Soviet ties, which have
been improving, the spokesman said only, ``I will not characterize
the incident beyond describing it.''
   Meanwhile, other Pentagon officials said the matters are being
investigated, and some expressed irritation that such activity may
be continuing despite the agreement that is about to take effect.
   One senior Pentagon official, commenting on condition of
anonymity, said laser activity is suspected because of past
incidents and because of descriptions provided by the military
personnel involved in the most recent cases.
   Williams said he could not identify a Soviet vessel involved.
Pentagon sources said, however, that it was a military ship that
was in the waters where Soviets have traditionally observed the
splashdowns for their missile tests.
   U.S. planes traditionally observe the movements of such Soviet
ships, the sources said.
   Lasers are sometimes used as rangefinders to target enemy
aircraft.
   The afflicted U.S. crewman _ a loadmaster aboard an HC-130
aircraft _ suffered disruption of his color vision, headaches and
other visual problems and is under medical evaluation, the Pentagon
sources said.
   The crewman had been wearing ``laser eye protection'' gear at
the time, and U.S. officials are also investigating why the damage
could occur despite that equipment, the sources said.
   In 1987, the copilot of an Air Force WC-135 suffered vision
problems when she observed a nearby U.S. Navy reconnaissance
aircraft ``illuminated'' by a laser that was determined to have
come from the Soviet ship Chukotka. The vessel was operating off
Hawaii, near the target zone of a Soviet missile test.
   The Air Force said at the time the crew member's vision was
affected for about 10 minutes and that the damage was not believed
permanent.
   Williams noted that it is now standard procedure for U.S.
personnel in such areas to wear protective eye gear in order to
avoid damage from the intense beams of light.
   He offered these details of the most recent incidents:
   _On Oct. 17, the injured crewman aboard an HC-130 experienced
``what may have been possible laser illumination'' about 1,200
miles southwest of Hawaii as the plane was observing a Soviet ship.
   _On Oct. 28, the flight crew of a Navy P-3 observation plane
again reported the possible laser illumination from the same Soviet
vessel, then about 1,800 miles southwest of Hawaii. No injuries
were reported from that sighting.
   _On Nov. 1, another Air Force HC-130, flying about 1,000 miles
west of Hawaii, again reported possible laser illumination from a
Soviet vessel. A few minutes later, a similar report was received
from an Air Force WC-130, a four-engine weather observation plane,
located 780 miles south of the first aircraft. Again, no injuries
were reported.
   The fourth incident was connected with the Soviet ship involved
in the first two incidents, but a second Soviet ship may have been
involved in the initial Nov. 1 illumination, Pentagon officials
said.
   The HC-130 Hercules four-engine turboprops are often used for
surveillance purposes.
   The Pentagon sources said that because no official determination
has yet been made that lasers were involved _ and since the new
U.S.-Soviet agreement is not yet in effect _ no protests have been
filed with Soviet officials.
   One official noted that following the similar type of incident
in 1987, a protest was filed under a 1972 ``incidents at sea''
agreement.
   The pact that takes effect Jan. 1, worked out in nine months of
negotiations, covered four points and was designed to allow for
``communications to avoid and resolve'' military incidents between
superpower military forces.
   The agreement dealt with the accidental straying of military
units into the other nation's territory; hazardous use of laser
range finders that could blind the other country's soldiers or
sailors; hampering the other country's military operations in a
tense area such as the Persian Gulf, and interfering with command
and communications networks of the two militaries.
   Pentagon officials said the pact included lasers because of the
1987 incident.

<HEAD>Soviets Plan Military Rummage Sale of Scrapped Missile Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Missile carriers, generators and mobile barracks
will go up for grabs in a Moscow park this month at the Soviet
Union's first equivalent of a military rummage sale, organizers
said Thursday.
   The exhibit, which opens Nov. 28, is aimed at selling off
reusable parts of intermediate-range nuclear missile installations
that were dismantled under a 1987 superpower treaty.
   It is also meant to pave the way for broader sales of equipment
that will no longer be needed as the Soviet Union cuts its military
forces and future treaties rule out other types of weapons, said
Elvin Kalinin, one of the fair's organizers.
   The money the fair is expected to bring in this year will go in
part to help support servicemen who are discharged as a result of
the cutbacks, Kalinin said.
   The Soviet Union is in the process of reducing troops and tanks
in Europe and Asia, and it has shifted from aggressive arms-race
rhetoric to espousing a doctrine of ``reasonable sufficiency.''
   It has already destroyed 297 of its 654 SS-20s under the 1987
treaty and the rest are due to be scrapped over the next two years.
The United States, keeping pace, has eliminated 486 of its 846
rockets covered by the treaty.
   The proceeds from the military sale will also be used to raise
the living standards of soldiers remaining in the army and to
charity, said Kalinin, who heads Intellect, a foundation aimed at
encouraging creativity among youth that is one of the charities to
benefit from the sale.
   Foreigners will be allowed to buy most of the military goods on
sale at Moscow's Sokolniki Park, and some of the offerings will be
put up for auction.
   The several hundred items at the fair will include the
heavy-terrain vehicles used as missile carriers, radio and
electrical elements, generators, measuring devices, frames, pipes,
condensers and other miscellanea.
   Kalinin said the missile carriers could be used to transport
construction cranes or vats of fertilizer on farms and the mobile
living units that housed the missile installation crews could be
used by geologists in the field.
   The pipes and electrical supplies are assured plenty of Soviet
buyers because of the widespread shortage of construction
materials, Kalinin noted.
   Much of the equipment which was part of the nuclear missile
installations has never been used, he added.
   ``If it had been, we wouldn't be sitting here,'' he said.

   The U.S. Embassy in Haiti has expressed
concern to Haitian officials about the arrests of three people
accused of plotting the overthrow of the government, the State
Department said Thursday.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the embassy believes that
the three, based on their appearance on television after their
arrests, were mistreated.
   ``The United States government urges that the government of
Haiti ensure that any detainees are treated in strict accordance
with Haitian law with respect to their civil and human rights,'' he
said.
   On Nov. 1, Haitian authorities detained Evans Paul, leader of
the Committee for Democratic Unity; Jean-Auguste Mesyeux, secretary
general of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers; and
Etienne Marino, a leader of the Popular Organization of September
17.
   The State Department said a general strike Tuesday and Wednesday
to protest the alleged mistreatment of the three was widely
observed.

<HEAD>Judge Spares Teen From Jail in Son's Death</HEAD>

   A 16-year-old mother of three who had been
abused most of her life was spared prison for the beating death of
her son by a judge who said putting her behind bars would only
continue the cycle of abuse.
   Tammie Janette Loray was sentenced Wednesday to three years in a
juvenile center on a no-contest plea Aug. 30 to second-degree
murder in the beating death of her 5-month-old son, Christopher
Cook Jr.
   ``If I take some other action now, I will not be breaking the
cycle of abuse. I will be perpetuating it,'' acting Circuit Judge
Dick Prince said.
   The girl had been sexually abused by her adoptive father from
age 4 to 11, abandoned twice by her adoptive mother and given to
other men before age 10.
   The judge told the teen-ager that her case ``involves the death
of two children because it seems to me you never had a childhood.''
   He sentenced her as a juvenile on the murder charge and as an
adult for aggravated child abuse. With 15 years' probation on the
abuse count, Miss Loray will be under the court's jurisdiction
until age 34.
   The prosecution wanted Miss Loray sentenced as an adult to 17
years in prison, and the defense asked that she be placed in
treatment for three years with no probation.
   Miss Loray and Christopher Cook Sr. took Christopher Jr. to an
emergency room March 4, 1988, where he died four days later,
authorities said.
   Her other son, Cameron Cook, was born Oct. 7, 1988, the day she
was indicted. Her first child, Marcia Cook, suffered brain damage
in September 1986. Authorities said the 3-month-old had been
violently shaken. No charges were filed.
   Psychologists, foster parents and state social workers testified
that Miss Loray is immature and suffers from severe depression and
low self-esteem.
   The judge warned the girl she faced prison if she failed to
cooperate during treatment or refused to complete programs thought
necessary by her parole officer.

<HEAD>NATO Prepares for Possible Withdrawals from Warsaw Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO on Thursday put final touches on a
plan that it said would curb conventional arms in Europe and ease
the path of Warsaw Pact countries that decide to leave the Soviet
bloc military alliance.
   Negotiators for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said the
proposals contained several new provisions placing more emphasis on
individual countries within the two military alliances.
   The NATO negotiators, who spoke outside the opening session of
the winter round of East-West non-nuclear arms talks, said the new
Western package defined the talks as between ``groups of states''
instead of the NATO and Warsaw Pact alliances.
   ``This is a development away from alliances and toward
individual states'' at the 23-nation talks, said chief delegate
Ruediger Hartmann of West Germany.
   A Western delegate who spoke on condition of anonymity
acknowledged the change of emphasis was in anticipation of possible
future moves by some Warsaw Pact countries to leave the Soviet-led
alliance of seven nations.
   Several Hungarian leaders have suggested in recent months that
their Warsaw Pact country might opt for neutrality in the
foreseable future as part of its reform process transforming it
from communist rule to multiparty democracy.
   The delegate indirectly acknowledged Hungarian developments
influenced the new language of the NATO proposals. He said some
countries contemplating a move away from the Warsaw Pact would be
reluctant to sign a treaty binding them to an alliance they could
soon be outside of.
   Hartmann, in the same vein, said that ``some Eastern nations now
(are) not ready to assume responsibilities for the whole East
bloc.''
   The NATO package thus proposes country-by-country limits on
weapons categories instead of only two ceilings _ one for NATO, the
other for the Warsaw Pact, said the delegates.
   It also would permit any individual country belonging to one of
the two alliances to unilaterally withdraw from a conventional arms
treaty if its supreme interests were jeopardized.
   Chief Soviet negotiator Oleg A. Grinevsky told another news
conference he was reluctant to comment on the NATO proposals before
seeing them, but he appeared cool to the ``group of states''
concept.
   ``It's possible to have some quotas for each country,'' he said,
when asked about individual country limits as opposed to alliance
ceilings. ``But the agreement (should be) ... between the two
alliances.''
   The NATO proposals were to be presented at Thursday's opening
round. But a Western delegate said last-minute disagreement among
the 16-nation Atlantic Alliance on their language meant they would
likely be submitted next week.
   While the proposals remain confidential, NATO negotiators said
they contained modified versions of suggestions made by the Western
side since the talks opened in March, including:
   _ Limiting the size of military exercises to no more than 40,000
troops per bloc
   _ Mandatory advance notification of major mobilization of
reservists and of large troop movements
   _ Mandatory easy access to specific weapons depots with up to
one-fifth of each side's arsenals and simplified surveillance of
equipment in units with a low level of readiness.
   The East already has agreed to the 40,000-person limit on
maneuvers but has sought to limit such large exercises to once
every three years instead of once every two years, as proposed by
NATO earlier.

   Proposed federal tax restrictions have
halted and may collapse plans to build a tunnel under Berthoud Pass
to this ski resort.
   The Berthoud Tunnel Authority had hoped to sell $247 million in
tax-exempt bonds in December for planning and construction of the
4-mile tunnel, which would spare motorists from having to drive a
fearsome, zigzag road over the 11,315-foot gap.
   But Ronald Drake, authority president, said Wednesday that a
budget bill passed by the House in October requires that 85 percent
of tax-exempt bonds be used within five years of sale. ``That stops
the project dead in its tracks,'' he said.
   Construction isn't scheduled to start until 1992 and the tunnel
isn't due to open until 1996.
   Drake has asked members of Colorado's congressional delegation
to seek an exemption to the restrictions. A Senate version of the
bill does not include the restriction.
   The tunnel would cut 20 minutes off the 90-minute, 55-mile drive
from Denver to Winter Park. Supporters say it will bring more
skiers to Winter Park.

<TEXT>
   Ferry passengers Thursday
recounted the panic after a freighter hit their ship and killed
three people, but the owners said more may have died if an
after-dinner dance had not been delayed.
   The Hamburg, a Danish ferry bound for Harwich, England, with
nearly 400 people aboard, was rammed by the 8,206-ton
Panama-registered Nordic Stream in high winds and rough seas south
of the North Sea island of Helgoland on Wednesday night.
   Three passengers _ two Britons and one German _ died and 11
people were injured when the container ship's bow punched a 60-foot
gash into the ferry's hull, according to the vessel's owner, Danish
Scandinavian Seaways.
   ``I was in the lounge just having a drink. The next thing we
knew we were flying through the air and tables and chairs and glass
were flying about,'' said Bill Peart, one of a group of British
passengers.
   ``There was a lot of panic, people were picking themselves up
off the floor and dashing to the nearest exit and trampling over
everybody,'' said Peart, 37. ``People thought it was going to
sink.''
   Witnesses said parts of the ferry's dance lounge were hanging
out of the hole in the hull. The freighter's deck was littered with
cocktail chairs from the ferry.
   The lounge was nearly empty when the crash occurred because the
leader of the ship's band was feeling sick and had postponed a
scheduled dance by half an hour, Seaways officials said. The ferry
was only about one-third full.
   The West German Transport Ministry said sea traffic controllers
had warned both boats they were sailing dangerously close to one
another. The cause of the crash was still under investigation, a
ministry statement said.
   Six seriously injured people from the ferry were flown by
helicopter to land for treatment before the Hamburg limped into
Bremerhaven.
   West German authorities said the crash occurred as the Hamburg
was steaming out to sea and the Nordic Stream was headed toward the
Elbe Channel in the direction of Hamburg harbor. A storm warning
was in effect at the time.
   Scandinavian Seaways said the ferry was carrying 96 crew members
and 277 passengers, including 60 Britons, 192 Germans, 16 Danes and
nine others of unidentified nationality.
   The ferry, which can carry 1,000 people, sails every two days
between Hamburg and Harwich.

<HEAD>Virgin Records Chairman Announces Planned Balloon Crossing Of Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two balloonists who became the
first to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a hot air balloon announced
plans Thursday to make the first such voyage across the Pacific
Ocean.
   Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Records and Virgin Atlantic
Airways will be co-pilot of the unnamed 19-story high silver
balloon with balloonist Per Lindstrand beginning sometime from Nov.
15 to Dec. 15, depending on weather.
   They will take off from Miyakonojo, Japan, rise 36,000 feet to
catch the jet stream and travel at speeds of 150 mph to 200 mph for
about three days before landing, if all goes as planned, somewhere
along the West Coast of the United States.
   Branson and Lindstrand became the first to successfully cross
the Atlantic in a hot air balloon flight in 1987 for a world record
distance of 3,072 miles. The Pacific journey could be as long as
6,200 miles.
   They are undertaking the journey in part to call attention to
the environment and the problems of global warming. The balloon
will carry a slogan ``Save the Planet.''
   ``It will be a great personal adventure for both of us, one of
the last great personal adventures left of this kind,'' said
Branson at a news conference in the Santa Monica Air Museum at the
city's airport.

<HEAD>Senate Sends Bush Congressional Mailings Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday sent President Bush a
bill to save congressional newsletters, reversing a previous vote
to ban the mailings that had touched off a congressional civil war.
   The compromise, negotiated earlier in a bitter House-Senate
conference, was adopted by voice vote and will halve the number of
unsolicited mass mailings from six-to-three per lawmaker.
   On Sept. 7, in an action that enraged the House, senators voted
88-7 for an amendment to ban the mass mailings and give the
estimated $45 million in savings to a treatment program for
pregnant women with drug addictions.
   But senators knew that vote was preliminary, and faced with
nearly identical language Thursday they voted 66-29 to kill the
proposal by Sen. Pete Wilson. The lawmakers then adopted the $1.9
billion appropriations bill for congressional operations that
includes the compromise mail provisions.
   The mailings in question, usually newsletters, are addressed to
postal patrons rather than individual constituents and increase
greatly during election years.
   The September Senate vote to ban the mailings led to ruffled
feelings that saw members of each house threaten _ and back off _
from proposals to change the other's rules.
   Senators didn't like the idea that only their rules require
disclosure of mailing costs by each member, and sought to force
House disclosure.
   House members threatened to retaliate by trying to end senators'
use of money from honoraria, political action committees and party
campaign committees for office expenses. House rules prohibit such
expenditures.
   In the end, the compromise sent to the White House includes a
package of reforms in the congressional mail system.
   The measure would establish for the first time separate House
and Senate mail accounts; limit the size of newsletters to two
sheets of paper; establish a voluntary procedure for keeping mail
costs within their budget; and strictly enforce a prohibition
against postal patron mailings 60 days before an election.
   The compromise would budget $100.2 million for mailings,
including $44.5 million for the House, $23.9 million for the Senate
and the remainder to pay the Postal Service for mailings that
exceeded the fiscal 1989 mail budget.
   Wilson, R-Calif., arguing for the ban on mailings, told
colleagues to ask themselves ``how often you've been begged for a
newsletter.''
   ``No wonder the public grows cynical when they see us putting
our perks ... above their needs,'' he said. ``They did not elect us
to put junk mail ahead of ... treatment'' for pregnant women
addicted to drugs.
   Wilson said the government only spent $4.5 million during the
last fiscal year for the treatment, and would have added $45
million in savings from the mailing ban. However, those opposing
Wilson noted that Congress already has approved $85 million for the
program in the current fiscal year.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., sponsor of the compromise that was
adopted, said the House would never accept the mailing ban and
would back away from the other mail reforms if the Senate changed
the agreement.
   The result, he said, would be no congressional mail reforms.
   ``It's the best we're going to get,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Ex-Dairy Princess to Stand Trial in Killing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former dairy princess Lori Esker was ordered
Thursday to stand trial in the strangling of a former schoolmate
during a quarrel over a boyfriend.
   Ms. Esker, 20, of rural Hatley, is charged with first-degree
intentional homicide. The 1989 Marathon County dairy princess is
accused of strangling Lori Cihaski, 21, of Birnamwood during an
argument Sept. 20 in Ms. Cihaski's car. She resigned as dairy
princess after being charged and is free on bail.
   Ms. Esker smiled as she entered court Thursday. She wrote in a
notebook during the proceedings and visited with several friends
afterward.
   Marathon County Circuit Judge Michael Hoover set a Dec. 1
hearing for Ms. Esker to make a plea to the charge.
   Her attorney, Steven Glynn, said the three-week delay in
entering a plea was granted because prosecutors may decide to file
a different charge. No plea negotiations have started, Glynn said,
``but that doesn't mean we are not going to have conversations.''
   Glynn has filed court documents contending that statements Ms.
Esker gave detectives violated her constitutional right against
self-incrimination.
   Sheriff's Detective Randall Hoenisch testified Thursday Ms.
Esker told authorities Sept. 29 that she killed Ms. Cihaski after
Ms. Cihaski ``grabbed her and shook her.''
   Hoenisch said Ms. Esker sobbed as she recounted how the fight
between her and Ms. Cihaski broke out while the two talked about
their relationships with Eland dairy farmer Bill Buss, 25.
   Friends have said Buss, Ms. Esker's one-time boyfriend, was
about to become engaged to Ms. Cihaski. The two women were in a car
parked outside a Wausau hotel where Ms. Cihaski worked when the
fight erupted, authorities said.
   Ms. Esker, a junior at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls,
told detectives she implied she was pregnant by Buss and Ms.
Cihaski responded angrily and ``grabbed at her hair and grabbed at
her neck,'' Hoenisch testified.
   Hoenisch said Ms. Esker told him she feared for her life.
   Ms. Esker told investigators at one point she pulled Ms. Cihaski
down on the seat of the car and ``pinned her there by putting a
forearm around her throat,'' Hoenisch said.
   Ms. Esker said she saw a belt in the back of the car, grabbed it
and ``put it on Lisa Cihaski's neck,'' Hoenisch said, adding that
Ms. Esker dumped out a purse and found a mirror to check whether
Ms. Cihaski was breathing.
   ``She told us she didn't mean to hurt her,'' the detective
testified.
   More than 150 people packed the courtroom Thursday, including
Buss, Ms. Cihaski's parents, Ms. Esker's parents and Christopher
Jacobs III, a Medford dairy farmer recently acquitted on charges he
participated in the 1987 Kunz family killings in nearby Athens.

<TEXT>
   The Contras announced a new military-dominated
commission Wednesday to lead the Nicaraguan rebels, but ousted
civilian leaders immediately denounced the move as a coup.
   The formation of the ``civilian-military commission,'' as the
group calls itself, came as the Contras and Sandinista government
opened talks at the United Nations aimed at ending the civil war in
Nicaragua.
   The new Contra leaders include three military commanders and
Aristides Sanchez, a civilian holdover from the old seven-member
directorate.
   ``The commission was formed by military commanders ... because
of the disintegration of the the old directorate,'' Contra military
spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said.
   Three of the seven civilian directors have returned to
Nicaragua, the U.S. has cut off funds to the old directorate, and
most of the Contra supply and demobilization effort is already in
the hands of the military, he said.
   Acevedo added that the Contra's U.N. negotiating team has
recognized the new commission.
   But two of the civilian directors, who were elected by the
Nicaraguan Resistance's 54-member legislative assembly, quckly
denounced the body as a power grab that violated the Contras'
internal rules.
   ``The intervention of the military in civilian matters has
always been a great problem in our country,'' said Adolfo Calero,
who was a leader of the resistance since it was formed in the early
1980s. ``I want respect for insitutions, and for the military to
keep in their headquarters and do their duty.''
   Calero blamed the takeover on the State Department, which he
said had undercut the directorate to favor military commanders.
   ``They have a short memory on how the military has screwed up
before,'' he said.
   The State Department did not immediately return calls from The
Associated Press.
   In San Jose, Costa Rica, Wilfredo Montalvan, another civilian
director, said the new commission was supposed to work under the
directorate, not replace it.
   ``The disbanding of the directorate would violate the statutes
of the assembly, and I consider that a coup which creates a serious
precedent,'' said Montalvan.
   Members of the new commission, however, defended the body and
said it was necessary because the directorate had ceased
functioning.
   Commander Franklin, the Contra's military chief of staff and a
member of the commission, issued a statement saying the goals of
the movement had not changed. He and the other two military
leaders, Commanders Ruben and Dimas, are known only by their
battlefield psuedonyms.
   The new leaders will do ``everything necessary to fulfill the
historic goals of our organization _ achieving peace and national
reconciliation through the full democratization of Nicaraguan
society,'' Franklin said.
   Asked about the old directors, Acevedo noted that if military
commanders agree, there is an option to expand the commission to
seven members, and it is possible former directors could join.
   Calero, however, rejected the possibility.
   ``I would be doing a disservice to democracy if I approved, and
I will not,'' he said.

   The White House said today a decision by the
East German government to allow its citizens to travel freely was
an important step toward democratic reform.
   ``We have always called for and supported freedom of movement,''
said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``The East German decision would be an important step in the
direction of peaceful and evolutionary democratic reform. It would
seem to be a positive response to the wishes that the East German
people have voiced so strongly in the last few months,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said free travel for East
Germans would be a ``very positive development'' that the United
States would welcome.
   ``We've been talking a long time about freedom of travel being a
basic human right. We've been talking a long time about open
borders. We've been talking a long time about the importance of
seeing the wall come down,'' Baker said.
   He spoke to reporters after hosting a luncheon for Philippines
President Corazon Aquino.
   East Germany said today it was opening its borders to the rest
of the world and that its citizens can travel or emigrate anywhere,
including through the 28-year-old Berlin Wall.
   Fitzwater said, ``The country appears to have been moving in
that direction, but I think it was a surprise when it happened. At
least we had no advance warning.''
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, ssaid the East German decision amounts to ``the symbolic
destruction of the Berlin Wall.''
   Mitchell urged East Germany and Gorbachev to ``take the final
step and tear that wall down.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said ``the Berlin
Wall and all that it represents are crumbling, even as the
communist state which built it crumbles, too.''
   He said the United States should make clear its desire that the
East German people achieve freedom and that the country's communist
government be replaced by a functioning democracy.
   ``But we should not do anything at this point which might
needlessly add fuel to the fire,'' Dole said.
   Fitzwater said providing food, clothing and housing for the
refugees does ``present problems.''
   ``I think all the countries of the world, certainly the allied
countries, stand ready to watch and help as necessary. But at this
point that hasn't been required,'' said the White House spokesman.
   So far, he said, ``the West German government has been managing
this exodus into their country pretty well.'' He said Bush and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl have talked previously about the situation.
   ``We have always urged movements toward democracy. President
Reagan called for tearing down the Berlin wall. We have been
supportive of the border release of its citizens and we think those
are important moves.''

<HEAD>Kohl-Mazowiecki Talks Focus on Border Issues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Border issues spurred by dramatic
developments in East Germany and a conflict over Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's visit to Auschwitz dominated the first day of his historic
visit to post-communist Poland.
   Kohl's talks with Solidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki
upon arrival for a six-day visit were ``extremely open'' and
wide-ranging, according to spokesmen for both governments.
   But the increasingly topical issue of eventual German
reunification appeared to be the focus of the nearly two hours of
discussion between Kohl and Mazowiecki.
   ``Certainly Poland is now looking more seriously on the
possibility of this,'' said Polish government spokesman Henryk
Wozniakowski. ``The horizon of possible reunification is more
visible than a few months ago.''
   The chief Polish government spokesman, Malgorzata Niezabitowska,
and Kohl's information minister, Hans Klein, made clear that border
issues dominated the talks.
   Polish officials have been concerned about discussion among West
German conservatives of the possibility of seeking reunification
within the 1937 borders of the German Reich, which would involve
large areas now part of Poland.
   The West German parliament Wednesday proposed a resolution that
appears to recognize the areas of Upper Silesia and East Prussia as
permanent parts of the Poland.
   Polish officials expressed satisfaction with that, but in an
indication the issue remains sensitive, they pressed the West
German visitors for more concrete assurances that Bonn does not
covet the territories now a part of Poland.
   Klein, a member of the arch-conservative Christian Social Union,
said Kohl tried to explain to Mazowiecki the continuing
sensitivities among Germans expelled from their homelands in
territories awarded to Poland after World War II.
   ``It is necessary to win these people over,'' Klein said,
referring to those still unwilling to recognize the permanent loss
of their homelands.
   Ms. Niezabitowska said Mazowiecki ``stressed that Polish people
must have certainty that the question of borders be settled
permanently.''
   A 1970 treaty between West Germany and Poland recognizes the
Oder and Neisse rivers as the western boundary of Poland, but does
not commit an eventually reunified Germany to those terms.
   Kohl also met with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   Kohl is bringing a billion-dollar economic package that is
crucial for the Solidarity-led government to make the difficult
transition toward a market-oriented economy.
   The new government and Walesa have argued for massive Western
economic aid, saying it is needed to secure the fragile democratic
process under way.
   West Germany is Poland's largest Western trading partner and
Kohl has brought business leaders with him to start developing
joint projects.
   Earlier Thursday, sources disclosed that Kohl's visit to the
Auschwitz concentration camp had been delayed because the head of
West Germany's Jewish community said he could not take part in the
event on the Sabbath.
   West German officials with the Kohl delegation said before the
chancellor's arrival for a six-day summit that the visit originally
set for Saturday was delayed because of objections by Heinz
Galinski, head of the West German Jewish Community Council.
   Galinski, a member of the official delegation, told the West
German government that in accordance with Jewish religious customs,
he would not be able to travel Saturday, the sources said.
   On Thursday, Polish and West German officials responsible for
arranging the trip in Warsaw held an emergency meeting to resolve
the delicate problem before Kohl's arrival.
   Jaroslaw Szczepanski, deputy director of the government press
office, said there was mutual agreement to make the change.
   Klein and Ms. Niezabitowska said it appeared the trip could not
be fit in until Tuesday.
   Kohl already is committed to a visit Sunday to Krzyzowa, a
Silesian town where Nazi resisters met during the war, for a
meeting with ethnic Germans.
   Polish and West German leaders hope the visit will mark a new
beginning in relations between the former World War II adversaries,
but the trip has been marred by controversy.
   Memories of old territorial disputes and the legacy of the Nazi
era still cast shadows over efforts at reconciliation.
   Polish anxiety over a planned visit by Kohl to Gora Sw. Anny,
known in German as Annaberg, the site of a bloody battle in 1921
over whether the area should go to Poland or Germany, forced
officials to find another place for a meeting with ethnic Germans.
   Polish officials apparently feared that a visit by Kohl to the
once disputed city could fuel ethnic tension in the area.
   West Germans have expressed concern that the rights of the
ethnic German minority are not being respected by Poland.

<HEAD>Hindus Begin Building Temple at Disputed Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AYODHYA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a superficial scratching of earth and
placement of four bricks, Hindu fundamentalists Thursday reaffirmed
their intention to build a temple that has stirred a religious and
political storm.
   Outnumbered by police and paramilitary troops surrounding the
site, about 2,000 Hindu holy men, politicians, worshipers and
youthful, unarmed guards mobbed a patch of earth considered sacred
by Hindus and Moslems.
   Tens of thousands of other Hindu faithfuls streamed by behind
the ceremony site outside a police barricade. Hindus planned a
formal start to dig the foundation on Friday.
   At least 290 people have died in Hindu-Moslem clashes since
August when Hindu fundamentalists announced they would build a new
temple to the god Ram on the site of an existing 17th century
mosque.
   The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which is behind the temple program,
maintains the mosque was built atop an ancient Hindu temple marking
the spot where the group says Ram was born 900,000 years ago.
   Most of the deaths occurred late last month in Bihar state, next
to Ayodhya's Uttar Pradesh state, as bricks for the temple were
borne by Hindu processions to this dusty town on the Saryu River.
   There have been no reports of deaths in Ayodhya, and there was
no sign of violence in the town of 35,000 on Thursday. The Ayodhya
case has become a major campaign issue for Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi as he seeks to return his Congress Party to power in
elections that will be conducted Nov. 22, 24 and 26.
   But neither he nor the man trying to replace him, Vishwanath
Pratap Singh of the National Front coalition, has offered a
solution. They are fearful of alienating the vote of Hindus, who
make up 82 percent of India's 880 milliion people, although Hindus
traditionally have voted for secular parties. The candidates also
want the Moslem vote, which usually has gone heavily to the
Congress Party.
   Singh had planned to visit Ayodhya on Thursday to cool religious
tensions, but changed his plans and made a short stop in Faizabad,
about four miles away.
   In Faizabad, Singh said the Hindu-Moslem dispute over the
Ayodhya site ``cannot be decided by the courts.'' He declined to
say how it should be decided.
   The question of proprietorship at Ayodhya has been dragging
through the courts for four decades.
   So far the only thing legally clear is that the initial
foundation for the new temple is slated for a 25-foot-by-23-foot
plot owned by a Hindu. This tiny plot could hold little more than
the front steps of the proposed temple.
   The rest of the envisoned two-story, three-domed structure would
engulf land whose ownership is under dispute, including the 17th
century mosque.
   ``We will not break down this structure,'' said Ashok Singhal,
referring to the the building Moslems call the Babri Masjid, or
Mosque of Babar. Hindus call it the Ram Janambhoomi, or Ram's
birthplace.
   ``It can be lifted _ honorably lifted _ and moved, so this
mosque, if it is a mosque, is not destroyed,'' said Singhal, a
senior trustee of the committee to build the new Hindu temple.
   Singhal said he hoped to make such an attempt and begin
contruction within a month, leaving the impression that it would be
deferred until after a new government is chosen.

<HEAD>Bishops Urge Palestinian Homeland, Approve AIDS Statement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops Thursday
called upon the United States to press for Middle East talks
leading to an independent Palestinian homeland. The statement drew
immediate criticism from Jewish leaders.
   On the last day of its fall meeting, the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops also approved a statement on AIDS that rejects
condom education in public schools and the distribution of clean
needles to drug addicts.
   The bishops unanimously approved a statement on the Middle East
that declares Palestinians have a right to participate as equals in
negotiations affecting their destiny and a right to territory.
   The statement called upon the Arab states and Palestinians to
recognize Israel's right to exist, and said there must be limits
negotiated on Palestinian sovereignty to protect Israel's security.
   The bishops urged the administration to increase talks with
Palestinians, ``clearly'' express its support for a Palestinian
homeland, press Arab states to normalize relations with Israel and
urge all foreign nations, including Syria and Israel, to withdraw
from Lebanon.
   Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston said the statement is a ``sorely
needed invitation to dialogue for the cause of peace in the Middle
East.''
   But it drew criticism from American Jewish groups, including the
Synagogue Council of America, which said the bishops' report
``prejudges what can only be achieved through the process of
negotiations.''
   Rabbi A. James Rudin and Judith H. Banki of the American Jewish
Committee said the bishops' call for sovereignty ``removes
incentives for flexibility and accommodation on the part of
Palestinian leadership.''
   The AIDS statement approved in a 219-4 vote by secret ballot
rejected the bishops' conference's earlier conditional support for
condom education in public schools, urging that youngsters be
taught chastity instead.
   ``We caution young people not to be trapped into the `safe-sex'
myth, which is both a lie and a fraud,'' said Archbishop Roger
Mahony of Los Angeles, chairman of the committee that drafted the
statement.
   The statement also opposes universal mandatory AIDS testing,
calls for increasing federal funds for AIDS research, and denounces
violence and discrimination against AIDS patients.
   The statement said it builds on a 1987 document approved by the
conference's Administrative Board, but it drops a controversial
assertion in the earlier document that the church could tolerate
education about condoms in public school AIDS-prevention classes,
as long as sexual abstinence outside marriage was presented as the
``only morally correct and medically sure way'' to prevent the
deadly disease.
   Some bishops said the assertion could be misinterpreted as
condoning extramarital sex and artificial birth control.
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, newly elected
conference president, said in an interview that priests could still
counsel condom use in individual cases if it seemed the only
recourse, but the bishops decided against a general statement.
   On similar grounds, the bishops said supplying clean needles to
drug addicts to prevent infection from contaminated needles could
encourage drug abuse.
   Jay Blotcher, a spokesman for the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power in New York, said not giving youngsters information about
condoms is ``abandoning them to death.''
   Much of the debate Thursday focused on whether God should be
thought of as having a role in determining who gets AIDS. In the
end, the bishops rejected several proposed amendments on the matter.
   ``Without condoning self-destructive behavior or denying
personal responsibility, we must reject the idea that this illness
is a direct punishment by God,'' the bishops said.
   In other business Thursday, the prelates voted 175-12 to give
bishops the discretion to allow laypeople to assist at marriages
where priests or deacons are not available.
   Earlier in the week, the bishops approved a rite allowing
laypeople to conduct Sunday services, though not Mass, in the
absence of a priest. Both rules still must be approved by the
Vatican.
   Also earlier in the week, the bishops:
   _Approved a strong anti-abortion resolution, making a special
plea to Catholic legislators to work to eliminate legalized
abortion and saying that no Catholic could responsibly take a
pro-choice position.
   _Approved a statement on food policy that decried the loss of
the family farm, said the growing concentration of farmland in the
hands of large corporations threatens the common good, and called
for more rights for farmworkers and less use of chemical
fertilizers and pesticides.
   _Endorsed a plan to increase the participation of black
Catholics in the church.
   _Elected Pilarczyk, who had been confererence vice president, to
a three-year term as president. Archbishop William Keeler of
Baltimore was elected vice president.

<HEAD>Negotiator Says Agreement on Verification Procedures Seems Near</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief U.S. negotiator at talks with the
Soviet Union said Thursday that progress has been made on
verification procedures and that there is a good chance two
never-ratified arms control treaties can be initialed at the
U.S.-Soviet summit meeting planned for next summer.
   Ambassador C. Paul Robinson told the Senate Foreign Relatons
Committee that the negotiators ``have an excellent foundation for
completing our work in time for the summit next year.''
   The two pacts _ the 1974 Treaty on the Limitation of Underground
Nuclear Weapon Tests and the 1976 Treaty on Underground Nuclear
Explosions for Peaceful Purposes _ were signed by the United States
and the Soviet Union but have never been voted on by the Senate.
   Opponents of the treaties as originally negotiated contend that
verification provisions in the treaties are insufficient to
guarantee against cheating.
   The two treaties would limit the maximum yield of nuclear test
explosions to 150 kilotons.
   But now, Robinson said, verification technology has advanced to
the point that a supplemental agreement on verification procedures
appears to be within reach.
   Another U.S. official said, however, that the United States will
block an attempt by 41 other nations to amend the 1963 Limited Test
Ban Treaty to establish a comprehensive, permanent ban against all
nuclear weapons testing.
   Kathleen C. Bailey, an official of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said the United States will exercise its treaty
rights to prevent the transformation of that treaty into a
comprehensive test ban in the belief that testing is essential to
ensure the reliability of the nation's nuclear deterrent.
   Test ban advocates disagreed, saying that testing is not needed
to make sure nuclear weapons are reliable and asserting that such
tests result in the production and deployment of more destructive
nuclear arms.
   ``The U.S. position on nuclear testing is clear,'' Dr. Bailey
said. ``Nuclear testing is indispensable to the maintenance of the
credible nuclear deterrent that has kept the peace for 40 years.
... Testing is necessary to ensure the reliability of our nuclear
deterrent and improves the safety, security and survivability of
our weapons.''
   She said a comprehensive test ban can be contemplated only when
deep and verifiable strategic and conventional arms reductions have
been achieved.
   But the committee's chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said
that if a complete test ban goes into effect ``the weapons are less
likely to be reliable and therefore less likely to be used.''

   Former Beatles Paul McCartney, George
Harrison, Ringo Starr, and John Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, have
settled a series of lawsuits among themselves and their record
companies, ending a decade of legal fights.
   The settlements involving Apple Records, EMI Records and its
American subsidiary, Capitol Records, were announced Wednesday by
Bhaskar Menon, chairman of EMI Music Worldwide and Capitol-EMI
Music Inc.
   As part of the agreement, terms were not disclosed and none of
the parties commented beyond a statement in which Menon praised the
Beatles ``unique legacy in the history of popular music.''
   The rock 'n' roll group disbanded in 1970. Nine years later, the
Beatles' recording company, Apple, sued EMI and Capitol Records,
which hold licensing rights to their music. They sought $50 million
in damages for underpaid royalties from alleged failure to report
the sale of 19 million records from 1969 to 1979.
   Apple filed two more lawsuits in 1987, charging that the
Beatles' recording of ``Revolution'' had been used to advertise
athletic shoes without the group's approval and that EMI was
delaying release of Beatles songs on compact disc.
   ``If they have indeed come to the end of the long and winding
road, it's wonderful,'' said Elliot Mintz, a spokesman for Ono. ``A
number of attorneys on both sides of the Atlantic have probably put
their children through college on this,'' Mintz added.

<TEXT>
   An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease
suspected of causing 17 illnesses and three deaths after a class
reunion has scarred the image of this agricultural community as a
wholesome convention site.
   ``There's concern, grave concern, over what this will mean to
the community,'' said Darlene Hamilton, manager of the Chamber of
Commerce of Lamar, population 8,600, which depends heavily on
tourism and conventions.
   City administrator Roy Lauricello said the town still was
reeling from a decision by a bus manufacturer to lay off 200 people
last year.
   Eighty-five people were laid off Monday when the Best Western
Cow Palace Inn closed voluntarily while health officials took more
than 200 samples from air conditioning ducts, water and the cooling
system, breeding grounds for the bacteria that cause the disease.
   The samples are being analyzed at the federal Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, which expects to have preliminary
results next week. Health officials expressed confidence that the
Cow Palace will then reopen, after any sources of the bacteria are
sterilized.
   More than 250 people from 21 states attended a Lamar High School
reunion Sept. 22-24, held for classes of 1941 and earlier at the
Cow Palace. The motel has about 300 guests per night and brings an
average of one convention a week to Lamar, a highway crossroads
town 220 miles southeast of Denver.
   Six cases of Legionnaires' disease have been confirmed among 17
people who came down with pneumonia-like symptoms after attending
the reunion. Three of those stricken have died, and two of the
deaths involved confirmed cases of Legionnaires'. The other four
people with confirmed Legionnaires' disease recovered.
   Two other people got the disease after staying at the motel
prior to the reunion. However, health department officials said
Thursday those cases cannot be linked directly to the motel.
   Health Department spokeswoman Ann Lockhart said all of the cases
are suspected to involve Legionnaires' disease, but the health
department has to await laboratory confirmation.
   The health department canvassed those who attended the reunion
or worked at the motel, but is not trying to track down other Cow
Palace guests.
   Dr. Dan Rodrigue of the state Health Department said hundreds of
people may have been exposed, but only those with compromised
immune systems, such as the elderly, catch the disease.
   Symptoms usually appear in two to 10 days and include fever,
headache, appetite loss, muscle aches, coughs, abdominal pain and
fluid in the lungs, which sometimes leads to the disease being
misdiagnosed as pneumonia. A doctor must confirm the diagnosis with
a blood test.
   Dave Edelman, manager of the motel, said he has lived there for
14 years and neither his family nor employees became ill. Neither
have local civic leaders, who attended meetings at the motel.
   Nevertheless, the motel sat vacant this week, the indoor pool
and hot tub empty. A pale green light streamed in through a
skylight on dozens of empty tables set for guests.
   ``I don't know what we're going to do. I don't know if we can
survive this,'' said Edelman.
   Hamilton said the Business and Professional Women of Colorado
canceled its convention after news of the disease broke, costing
Lamar the money that would have been spent by 250 people. She is
worried about the Colorado Cattlemen's Association and state
convention of the Knights of Columbus next spring, but those groups
say they have made no decisions to cancel.
   Hamilton said the town is considering an expensive advertising
campaign to rebuild its image.
   ``These things stick in people's minds,'' Hamilton said. ``It's
not going away next week or next year.
   ``The damage is already done. No matter what the outcome of the
investigation, the damage is done.''
   Rodrigue, who worked without a mask while collecting samples in
the motel, said he would not be afraid to stay there once the
source of infection is discovered.
   Dr. Timothy Mastro of the CDC said a contamination usually is
neutralized with heat or chlorine, but may require continuing
periodic treatment.
   The bacterium is found in soil and grows in water, such as
air-conditioning ducts, storage tanks and rivers. Legionnaires'
disease takes its name from an outbreak at a Pennsylvania American
Legion convention in Philadelphia in 1976 that killed 34 people.
   This was the first case in Colorado, the Health Department said.

<TEXT>
   Hungary has completed the dismantling
of the electronic barrier along its westernmost border, an official
said Thursday.
   Hungary began dismantling the electronic signaling devices and
barbed wire fencing along its 220-mile border with Austria on May
2, physically dismantling part of the Iron Curtain between East and
West.
   Brigadier-General Janos Szekely, the national commander of the
Hungarian border guards, told representatives of 14 political
groups that the electronic signaling devices had been removed
completely, the state MTI news agency reported.
   It was not clear from the brief report whether the barbed wire
and other fencing has also been removed completely. The removal of
all barriers originally was scheduled to be completed by Dec. 1,
1990.
   Hungary's move to dismantle the border barriers followed
legislation allowing Hungarians to travel freely. This summer, tens
of thousands of East Germans used the open stretches of border to
flee to the West until Budapest announced it would allow the East
Germans to cross legally.

   Israeli soldiers fatally shot an armed
Palestinian in a roundup of the Red Eagles guerrillas Thursday and
killed a masked Arab activist during violent protests that erupted
after the raid, the military command said.
   Fifteen other Arabs were shot and wounded in demonstrations as
Palestinians marked the end of the 23rd month of a revolt against
Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   A general strike called by underground uprising leaders
paralyzed business and traffic and shut schools throughout the
occupied lands.
   The army command said a military force on routine duties in the
West Bank town of Nablus spotted a ``suspicious movement'' near a
house in the Jneid neighborhood before dawn Thursday.
   Israel media said troops surrounded the one-story house and used
a loudspeaker to order the suspects to come out. When they refused,
soldiers broke in through a metal door.
   ``There were six young men inside and one pulled out a pistol.
He was shot and killed, and the others were arrested and taken for
interrogation,'' an army statement said.
   The army said the victim, Iman Mohsein Al Ruzeh, and the
detainees belonged to the Red Eagles, a guerrilla group backed by
the radical Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a PLO faction that opposes Yasser Arafat's peace
initiative.
   The army said Al Ruzeh, 23, was wanted for alleged involvement
in the assassinations as well as for firebomb attacks, kidnappings
and violent interrogations of suspected collaborators.
   It said Jaber Mohammed Suleiman Fuash, 19, wanted by security
forces for involvement in the killing of eight Arabs, was among the
detainees.
   The Red Eagles are believed responsible for the slayings of nine
Nablus Palestinians suspected of ``moral offenses'' or assisting
Israeli authorities, as well as of other attacks against Israeli
troops, the army said.
   ``The nine were killed after severe torture, including killings
by axes and knives,'' the statement said.
   Nablus has been the site of a large portion of slayings of Arabs
accused of helping the Israeli authorities since the uprising
began. Of 143 Arabs killed on such charges, 23 were slain in
Nablus, with most of the slayings blamed on the Red Eagles or
another guerrilla group, the Black Panther Brigades.
   Israeli officials claim some of these gangs operate under direct
orders of the PLO, but Palestinians say at least some of the
murders were carried out in defiance of Arafat's orders.
   The raid was followed by violent clashes in Nablus in which one
Palestinian was killed and four others wounded. An Israeli border
policeman suffered moderate injuries in a stone-throwing attack
after which the army clamped a curfew on the city of 120,000, the
largest in the West Bank.
   Eleven other Palestinians were shot and wounded in Gaza,
hospital officials said.
   Thursday's deaths brought to 613 the number of Arabs killed by
Israeli gunfire in the uprising. Forty Israelis have also been
slain.

<HEAD>Democrats Welcome Wilder, Dinkins to Spotlight Once Jackson's Alone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic Party establishment on Capitol
Hill stood beaming Thursday with L. Douglas Wilder and David
Dinkins, clearly pleased to have mainstream elected officials
moving into a spotlight once held exclusively by Jesse Jackson.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and the entire Democratic leadership of
Congress smiled broadly as Wilder and Dinkins stepped forward at a
news conference in an ornate room off the Senate floor.
   ``Americans are prepared to accept candidates on the basis of
their individual talent,'' said Mitchell.
   Wilder and Dinkins needed strong support from white voters and
they got it by concentrating on running campaigns that stressed
mainstream positions on issues. Both campaigned as fiscal
conservatives who were tough on law and order questions.
   And both kept Jesse Jackson at arms length.
   Never totally comfortable with Jackson, establishment Democrats
dive for cover when he becomes involved with left-wing leaders
around the world. Only a week before the 1989 elections, President
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua called Jackson to ask him to intervene
with President Bush to obtain support for disbanding the Contra
forces.
   Democratic Party leaders can rest easy, aware that neither
Wilder nor Dinkins is likely to get any phone calls from Ortega.
   Other 1989 election winners were present _ House members who won
contests throughout the year to fill vacancies _ but most of the
attention was on Wilder and Dinkins, who scored racial
breakthroughs on Tuesday.
   While his Republican opponent had yet to concede and a recount
was likely, Wilder was claiming victory in the race for governor of
Virginia, a triumph that would make him the first black elected
governor of any state.
   Dinkins is the first black elected mayor of New York City.
   In both cases, the margin of victory was smaller than many polls
had predicted, a result that prompted speculation that race remains
a potent issue in American politics.
   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown, the first black to
head a major party, dismissed the speculation as ridiculous.
   ``All the questions now are, `Why didn't Wilder do better?' and
`Why didn't Dinkins do better?' It's a ridiculous question,'' he
said. ``The fact is that we have elected a Democratic mayor of the
city of New York, who happens to be black, and we've elected a
Democratic governor of the state of Virginia, who happens to be
black.''
   Even as Wilder and Dinkins celebrated their triumphs, talk
turned to what impact their emergence would have on Jackson, the
two-time presidential candidate who has been largely unchallenged
as the most prominent black in politics.
   Jackson campaigned for Dinkins in the New York City Democratic
primary but made few appearances for him during the general
election campaign and stayed clear of Virginia, where he and Wilder
agreed his presence would hurt more than help.
   After the election, Jackson sounded resentful of the emphasis
being placed on the distance Wilder and Dinkins put between him and
their campaigns.
   ``We stepped back strategically,'' said Jackson, speculating
that if Greeks had risen to prominence in the party after Michael
Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign ``no one would be trying to
find the disconnection, because the connection would be so very
apparent.''
   ``If we're members of the same team, does it matter who scored
the touchdown,'' said Jackson as he made the rounds of
post-election interview shows. ``If we're members of the same team,
if we win the championship, all of us get the ring.''
   Brown, who worked briefly on the Jackson presidential campaign,
said the victories of Wilder and Dinkins ``have little to do with
whether Jesse Jackson is going to be a pre-eminent spokesman. ... I
think Jesse Jackson will be a significant factor in the politics of
this country for as long as he wants to be.''
   Eddie Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political
Studies, a think tank that concentrates on studying political
trends among blacks, said he doubted Wilder or Dinkins would be in
a position for some time to challenge Jackson for pre-eminence as a
national figure.
   As a governor and as mayor of the nation's largest city, they
are on ``a different track'' than Jackson, said Williams.

   A San Francisco attorney criticized for his
one-time membership in a club that excludes women told senators
Thursday he fought to ease that restriction and vowed to be fair if
confirmed as a federal judge.
   ``I am more sensitive now than I was about the need for a
federal judge to conduct the courtrooms of the United States in a
way to insure fairness,'' Vaughn Walker told the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   The vow came at a hearing into the long-stalled nomination of
Walker as a judge in the Northern District of California.
   Walker has been fighting for confirmation for almost two years
while critics have argued that his former membership in the
exclusive Olympic Club should disqualify him.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., has asked the committee not to
recommend confirmation of Walker, who has strong support from Sen.
Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio and the acting chairman of the
committee, told Walker he has doubts as to whether the resignation
from the Olympic Club, dated Feb. 15, came soon enough to indicate
Walker really disapproved of discrimination practiced by the club.
   Until 1968, the club barred blacks from membership. Critics say
it now has few blacks among its 4,700 active members. It still
refuses to admit women to full membership.
   Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was a member but
resigned when his name was mentioned as a possible nominee for the
high court.
   In testimony before the committee, Judge Diane Wick of Municipal
Court in San Francisco called Walker ``a fair, thoughtful and
compassionate human being.''
   Judge Ina Gyemant of Superior Court in San Francisco said Walker
helped her with her first campaign, even though her opponent was a
Republican man.
   ``I have never found him to be unfair and I do believe that he
would be unbiased,'' she said.
   Metzenbaum questioned Walker closely on why his resignation
letter was not marked as received by the Olympic Club until April
15 when he said that it was dated Feb. 15. Walker said he gave the
letter to a former club official, David Dawson, to deliver and
never saw it again.
   Republican senators expressed dismay at the two years that the
Walker nomination has been pending.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said the questions about when
Walker's nomination became effective were ``to me just
extraordinary.''
   ``What's going on here is unethical, it's unfair and it's just
dirty politics,'' Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., declared.

<HEAD>Advisers Cite Possible Major Drawback to Linear Accelerator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advisers told Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins on Thursday that they have found a possible major drawback
to using a linear accelerator instead of nuclear reactors to make
tritium, a key ingredient in nuclear warheads.
   The 12-member Energy Research Advisory Board said in an interim
report to Watkins that the need for huge amounts of electricity to
run an accelerator could offset the machine's environmental, safety
and possible cost advantages over nuclear reactors.
   The panel is still studying the matter and is due to issue a
final report next February.
   If substantiated, the panel's interim finding could add weight
to the Bush administration's argument _ challenged by some members
of Congress _ that new nuclear reactors, not an accelerator, are
the best answer to the nation's tritium needs. The administration
has proposed spending $6.8 billion to build two new reactors.
   A linear accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which
subatomic particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash
into a target, in this case lithium clad in aluminium. The
resulting collision produces tritium, a radioactive gas used in
nuclear weapons to boost the warhead's explosive power.
   Government-owned nuclear reactors at the Savannah River Site in
South Carolina are the only source of tritium for U.S. nuclear
warheads. Those reactors, built in the early 1950s, have been idled
for repairs and safety improvements, and they are not expected to
last much beyond 2000.
   The administration says new production capacity is needed to
assure the readiness of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, although some
nuclear scientists dispute that.
   In the face of the administration's opposition to the
accelerator option, scientists at the Brookhaven and Los Alamos
national laboratories and at Westinghouse-Hanford Co. in Washington
state said earlier this year that an accelerator could produce
needed amounts of tritium more cheaply, quickly and safely than new
reactors.
   Watkins then asked the advisory board for an independent
assessment of an accelerator's potential.
   In its report, the board said one of its chief concerns is that
a linear accelerator would require between 800 megawatts and 900
megawatts of continuous power _ roughly equal to the entire
electric output of a large commercial power station.
   The board called that ``an amount that is not only costly but
may not be readily available in the time frame of the years 2000 to
2040'' when the accelerator would be working.
   It said a new power station, possibly a nuclear reactor, might
have to be built just to provide electricity for the accelerator.
In that case, the evironmental and safety advantages of an
accelerator would be ``totally submerged,'' the panel said.
   ``It may be simpler, in fact, to use a nuclear reactor to
produce tritium directly ... rather than have it, or a fossil
plant, produce electricity to operate the accelerator,'' the report
said.

   Increasing winds Thursday blew more
tumbleweeds into town, while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
contemplated how to stop an invasion that buried homes and blocked
streets.
   ``They're still coming,'' said Police Chief Brooks Johnson.
``The wind is picking up. They've been baling this morning, but
they're losing ground now.''
   Johnson said some streets that were blocked by tumbleweeds were
cleared Thursday. Officials were worried about fires from the
tinder-dry brush and traffic accidents, but Johnson said none had
been reported.
   ``Most of the people slow down and let the thistle blow across
the road before they drive through,'' he said.
   Two years of drought exposed the banks of the nearby Oahe
Reservoir, providing a perfect spot for the Russian thistle
commonly known as tumbleweed to flourish. High winds Tuesday night
launched the invasion; Thursday's forecast called for northwest
winds gusting to 35 mph.
   Crews have been trying to bale the weeds already in town, but
corps officials said Thursday they're not sure how to battle the
brush left along the reservoir.
   One option is a controlled burn, but the extent of the weeds and
the cool, windy weather could pose problems, said Mike George, a
natural resource specialist with the corps.
   Another is to chop the stringy weeds so they won't wrap around
one another into mounds that grow, snowball-fashion, as they're
tossed across the prairie.
   He estimated that several hundred acres of weeds remain on the
banks of the Missouri River.
   George said a combination of weather and geography led to the
flurry of tumbleweeds, which buried some homes in the north-central
South Dakota town of about 4,000 people.
   ``They grow all summer long, and at the first frost they die,''
he said. ``They break off right at ground level and get blown
around by the wind.''
   Other town need not worry he said, adding, ``Mobridge is fairly
unique in that it sits right on the river.''
   George said the weeds first appeared in the United States during
the late 1800s in South Dakota. The scrubby tumbleweeds have a
prairie charm that captivates the imaginations of tourists, he said.
   ``We get visitors to the lake all the time, and the two things
they just freak at are prairie dogs and tumbleweeds,'' he said.
``Only in South Dakota would you have a town taken over by
tumbleweeds.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Treasury Secretary Donald Regan told a
House panel Thursday that a planned bill to limit computer-driven
stock trading doesn't go far enough and suggested a ban on one form
of the market strategy.
   He targeted index arbitrage, in which speculators try to take
advantage of inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets
by simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other.
   Critics claim index arbitrage widens price swings and drives
small investors out of the market.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the
telecommunications and finance subcommittee, plans to introduce
legislation to restrict program trading during times of extreme
market turbulence.
   But Regan, the former head of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said the
proposal ``is more of a partial solution to the problem and, if
enacted, may not cure it.''
   He told the subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee that the problem is stock index futures _ futures
contracts tied to the performance of large groups of stocks.
   Regan suggested doing away with the commodity aspects of index
futures ``to lessen volatility'' or making ``the stock market
derivatives have the same rules as stocks.''
   Regan, who now heads the Alexandria, Va., investment firm of
Regdon Associates, told the panel, ``There are just a few traders
who are selfishly rigging the market for their own benefit,'' said
   Regan, head of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. before becoming Treasury
secretary under then-President Reagan, was part of a panel of
investment company executives that called for restraining program
trading.
   The witnesses split in their recommendations of what action
Congress should take.
   ``The problem we're addressing is volatility, not the program
trading problem,'' Philip J. Purcell, chairman of Dean Witter
Financial Services Inc., said.
   Although his firm has halted index arbitrage for customer
accounts, Purcell noted: ``The public should recognize that any
steps taken to curb program trading will not cure volatility.''
   Program trading _ almost instantaneous transactions through
computerized buy and sell programs _ has been a topic of dispute
for years but the debate heated up after the Oct. 13 stock market
slide.
   When the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped more
than 190 points last month, many critics said the situation was
worsened by program trading _ especially index arbitrage.
   The panel members agreed that market volatility scares investors
out of the market, making it more difficult for U.S. companies to
raise capital through the sale of securities.
   Most of Wall Street's large investment houses recently have
revised their policies on index arbitrage.
   And the New York Stock Exchange has called on large,
institutional investors to curb program trading while ways to
handle the bursts of stock orders it generates are considered.
   Markey's plan would grant emergency powers to the Securities and
Exchange Commission to temporarily halt program trading during
extreme market turbulence.

<HEAD>Thrusters Fire as Galileo Starts First Trajectory Change on Jupiter
Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three weeks after its launch from a
shuttle, the Galileo spacecraft fired its thrusters Thursday to
begin the first of about 30 course changes needed for its
roundabout six-year trip to Jupiter.
   ``We've started the first trajectory correction maneuver,''
mission director Neal Ausman said after the three-day series of
thruster ignitions got under way at 8:31 a.m. PST.
   During the maneuver, Galileo is firing four of its 12 thrusters
in a series of pulses, he said. No individual pulse exceeds two
minutes, each set of pulses takes about 45 minutes, and the entire
maneuver will be completed Saturday night.
   Two other thrusters may be used to correct the spacecraft's rate
of spin and the direction toward which it points, said Ausman, of
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The trajectory change is meant to aim Galileo for its flight
past Venus in February. The spacecraft, launched from space shuttle
Atlantis on Oct. 18, will swoop by Venus once and Earth twice so
the planets can act as ``gravity slingshots'' to propel Galileo
toward Jupiter during the $1.9 billion mission.
   On Thursday, Galileo was about 31 million miles into its looping
2.4 billion-mile journey to the solar system's largest planet,
Ausman said. It was about 4.6 million miles from Earth and 58.5
million miles from Venus, traveling at 60,376 mph relative to the
sun.
   In July 1995, Galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe.
The orbiter will circle Jupiter for 22 months starting in December
1995, the same month the probe will parachute into the Jovian
atmosphere, making measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed
by intense pressure.
   About 30 course corrections involving thruster firings spread
over 135 days will be required en route to Jupiter, Ausman said.
   Galileo has ignited its 3.5 inch-long thrusters on other
occasions, but those firings were to adjust spin or direction,
Ausman said. The three-day maneuver that started Thursday is
Galileo's first trajectory correction, he added.
   Ausman said the West German-built thrusters have to fire in
pulses to avoid contaminating sensitive parts of Galileo. The
thrusters are attached to the spinning part of Galileo, and can
fire only when they are not above sensitive areas on the
non-spinning section of the spacecraft.
   The thrusters also are fired in pulses because NASA fears
continuous firing might make them overheat and burn through, a
problem that developed on the same type of thrusters on two
satellites in recent years, Ausman said.

<HEAD>Ozal Names Loyal Supporter to Head New Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Turgut Ozal was sworn in as Turkey's
second civilian president Thursday and named a loyal follower to
succeed him as premier in an apparent attempt to maintain control
from his new, weaker post.
   Ozal named Parliament speaker Yildirim Akbulut just hours after
he was inaugurated.
   Elected by Parliament, Ozal assumed power from Kenan Evren,
leader of the 1980 military coup, who completed a seven-year
presidential term and by law could not run for re-election.
   The choice of Akbulut was dictated in part by fear that
factional fighting could disintegrate the governing Motherland
Party that has been held together by Ozal's leadership, political
analysts said.
   Akbulut quickly announced a Cabinet almost identical to the
previous one. Two state ministers were left out and seven new ones
were added.
   The 450-member Parliament, where the Motherland commands a
majority of 283 seats, will have a vote of confidence on the new
government sometime next week. The legislature will also elect a
new speaker.
   Included in the Cabinet were just about anyone likely to mount a
campaign for party leadership, which is to be decided in a
convention Nov. 17.
   Ozal, 62, was elected Turkey's eight president on a third ballot
Oct. 31 with the votes of 263 Motherland deputies.
   Opposition Social Democrat and centrist True Path parties
boycotted the inauguration ceremony just as they did the Parliament
sessions for the election of the president.
   The opposition has maintained that Ozal, blamed for 75 percent
inflation two years running and his popularity shrunken in the wake
of charges of nepotism and corruption in government ranks, lacked a
clear mandate necessary for the presidential post.
   They also claim he would transform the job with little executive
power into an imperial presidency, running the Motherland Party
from behind scenes, in violation of the constitution.
   In the presidential oath, accompanied by a 101-salvo cannon
salute, Ozal pledged to be free of bias. He said later, in an
inauguration address, that he would be true to his oath ``at the
cost of my life'' if necessary.
   Ozal first acquired political fame as deputy premier of the
military government when he initiated the 1980 economic rescue
program. He became premier in 1983 general elections restoring
civilian rule and Turkey enjoyed export-led growth under his
free-market economic policies.
   But high inflation, the price of the boom, has made economic
planning difficult, the poor have become poorer and the middle
class has shrunk.
   When he was elected president Ozal's public support was around
17 percent, according to public opinion polls.
   Akbulut, 52, served as interior minister in one of Ozal's
Cabinets until he was elected parliament speaker following 1987
general elections.
   The premier-designate is known as a moderate in the party which
includes liberal, Moslem fundamentalist and ultra-nationalist
factions.
   Akbulut raised the number of ministers to 30 from previous 25,
adding five more state ministerships.

<HEAD>Iraq to Open Waterway Linking Basra, Gulf</HEAD>

   Workers have dredged a 14-mile river to
open Iraq's largest port to major commercial traffic from the
Persian Gulf for the first time since the war with Iran began in
1980, an official said Thursday.
   Millions of tons of silt were removed from the Shatt-Al-Basra
River to make it navigable for medium and small-size vessels from
the southern port city of Basra to the gulf, said Sami Ajmi Kadum,
director-general of the government-run al-Muthana Irrigation Co.
   He said cargo ships with hulls up to 33 feet deep will be able
to navigate the waterway beginning Nov. 15, opening up the
war-battered south to expanded trade under Iraq's postwar
reconstruction drive.
   The waterway, which connects with the 30-mile-long Khor
Al-Zubair River that leads to the gulf, is an alternative to the
disputed and still-blocked Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, Iraq's main
outlet to the gulf before the war. It is also about half the
distance.
   The $12 million project was launched in October 1988 in a drive
to reopen Basra to commercial shipping, two months after the
cease-fire in the 8-year war with Iran. The port was shutdown when
the war began in September 1980.
   Kadum said millions of tons of silt have been dredged from the
channel between Basra's Maqal port and Khor Al-Zubair to the south.
There the waterway links with the Khor Al-Zubair river that runs
into the northern waters of the gulf through Umm Qasr, near the
Kuwaiti border.
   Kadum said the Shatt-Al-Basra was widened to 315 feet and its
depth increased by 19{ feet. It is fed by the Euphrates River and
Iraq's southern marshes.
   Iraq has demanded the Iranians allow the Shatt-Al-Arab, the
southern boundary between the two countries, to be reopened under a
United Nations cease-fire resolution.
   But Iran has refused to do so until Iraq agrees to abide by a
1975 treaty that draws the border down the middle of the waterway,
which is still blocked by war debris.
   Iraq says it abrogated the treaty a few days before war broke
out and insists that the border runs down the eastern, Iranian
shore.

<HEAD>Iran Says U.S. Release of Some Frozen Assets Not Sign of Good Will</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Iranian official said Thursday
that Washington's decision to release $567 million in frozen
Iranian assets was not a sign of U.S. good will.
   Since the repayment was ordered by a claims tribunal, ``it has
nothing to do with the U.S. administration's good will,'' Mahmoud
Vaezi, deputy foreign minister for European and American affairs,
said in Iranian news reports monitored in Cyprus.
   Iran has linked any effort to help free 18 Westerners held
hostage by Islamic groups in Lebanon to the U.S. releasing Iranian
assets frozen since 1979.
   The assets which Washington said Monday that it would release
are only a small portion of what Iran claims. President Bush said
Tuesday he hoped the action will prompt Iran to obtain freedom for
U.S. hostages, though administration officials said the decision to
transfer the money was unrelated to the hostage issue.
   Iran says the assets frozen a decade ago are up to $12 billion,
including the value of weapons purchased before the 1979 Islamic
revolution but never delivered.
   The assets were frozen after militants stormed the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran Nov. 4, 1979, and held American diplomats and other
personnel hostage. Fifty-two captives were released 444 days later.
   Earlier Thursday, in the first public reaction to the U.S.
decision, the Tehran Times newspaper said in an editorial that the
release was insufficient.
   The newspaper, which is close to Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, did not elaborate on the ``goodwill'' Iran is seeking
before mediating a release of the hostages held by Shiite Moslem
zealots.
   Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatists in Iran, told a
news conference last month that Iran would help secure the release
of the captives, including eight Americans, if Washington unblocks
Iranian assets.
   The money was held in a fund to guarantee American bank claims
against Iran. Most of those claims were settled in the past few
weeks, U.S. officials said.
   In addition to the Americans, the hostages in Lebanon are four
Britons, two Swiss, two West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.

   Investigators on Thursday recovered $17
million in artworks stolen from Pablo Picasso's granddaughter,
finding them at the home of a restaurateur, who was then arrested,
police said.
   Two other men _ both security guards at Marina Picasso's villa
in Cannes _ also have been arrested in the theft of the 13 works on
Sunday, police said.
   The restaurateur, Fernand Laugier, 47, was arrested in nearby Le
Pradet and charged with fencing stolen goods. The security guards,
Serge Clouzeau and Daniel Jaguin, were charged with serious theft.
All three men remained jailed Thursday night.
   Clouzeau was on vacation when the theft took place Sunday
morning and Jaguin had gone shopping for a loaf of bread, leaving
the villa unguarded for 40 minutes. Ms. Picasso was not home.
   Police identified the missing works only as seven paintings by
Pablo Picasso, a Breughel, an Odilon Redon, three lesser-known 19th
century works and a bust by sculptor August Rodin.
   The works have an estimated value of $17 million. All were
recovered Thursday and transferred to Nice, where the investigation
continues, police said.
   Ms. Picasso was spending the weekend in the Alpine town of
Megeve when the theft occurred at her 1900s-style Pavillon de Flore
in the Basse Californie section of Cannes.
   Ms. Picasso has made no public comment since returning to Cannes
on Monday. She is the daughter of Paul Picasso, the painter's son,
and his first wife, Olga Kokhlova.
   Investigators with the Nice police said early in the case that
all signs pointed to someone with intimate knowledge of the
property.
   There were almost no signs of a break-in, the sophisticated
burglar alarm did not function, and none of the five guard dogs
raised a fuss.
   Three current and former employees at the villa, including
Jaguin's girlfriend, were questioned Tuesday and released.

<HEAD>Quake Creates A Different Kind Of Disaster Victim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The earthquake that tore through Northern
California has been a postgraduate school for veteran Red Cross
worker Al Green, who says the disaster has produced a ``different
kind of clientele.''
   ``This has been a real learning experience for me,'' said Green,
who runs an Army base shelter that opened after the Oct. 17
earthquake.
   Shelters normally are designed to close quickly, said Green, 64,
a volunteer from Camden, Ohio, who has worked on 24 disasters.
   ``We figure a shelter will be closed in four days,'' he said in
his office at the Presidio while children played on the barracks
porch. More than three weeks have passed since the 7.1-magnitude
quake struck, killing 66 people and causing an estimated $7 billion
damage.
   In other disasters, said Green, the victims belonged to
``families where their houses were destroyed. They received
temporary shelter and then were gone. Here, it's also people who
lived in hotels, apartments, maybe on the streets. Some keep coming
back.''
   Red Cross officials estimated about 6,000 people needed help
after the quake. There are about 300 people now at the three
shelters on the Army base and fewer than 200 in a downtown shelter.
   While Green talked, a woman wearing a robe walked down the hall,
apparently after washing her hair. Outside, a man, his wife and
another woman watched children playing.
   The scene was almost pastoral compared to the more tense
atmosphere in the Red Cross shelter in downtown San Francisco,
where single men are housed and were shouting matches and even
brawls are not unknown.
   ``We only have men here,'' shelter manager Norma Brandt said.
``The bed count is now 125, down from a top of 300. Some of the
people we helped have gotten jobs and everyone staying in the
shelter has been verified as a quake victim.''
   No questions were asked in the immediate aftermath of the quake,
said Red Cross spokesman Bob Page.
   ``We just helped anyone one who needed it,'' said Page. ``A few
days ago, we started to limit shelter to those who could prove they
lived in a residence before the quake. Then again, your home before
the quake could have been a park bench.''
   As if to underscore the new limit on who may live there, a man
who had recently been told to leave yelled at Page as Page walked
to his car, telling him it would be ``smart'' to check under the
hood for explosives.
   Other men outside ticked off a list of complaints, ranging from
the food to the lack of showers.
   Michael McCabe, 37, has lived in the shelter since Oct. 25 when
he returned from a trip to find his Marina apartment destroyed.
   ``I lost everything, even my car,'' said McCabe, taking notes
for a book on the earthquake.
   McCabe said some of the men's gripes were legitimate.
   ``We had just cold cereal for breakfast this morning. Last night
it was chicken patties. We get lots of potatoes _ even had them
three times a day once.''
   San Francisco had a homeless problem before the quake and
officials have warned that unless low-income housing wrecked in the
disaster is replaced, the situation will only get worse.
   An estimated 80 percent of the housing left uninhabitable was
marked for the poor. Brad Paul, deputy mayor for housing, said
1,170 housing units were declared unsafe and 3,000 more were found
to need repairs.
   Worse still, city spokesman Erik Shapiro said the earthquake
destroyed ``a good part of the city's homeless program.''
   The program paid for a night's lodging for transients at certain
hotels. Shapiro figured the quake demolished 25 percent of those
hotel rooms.
   It isn't as if San Francisco hasn't gone through this before.
The massive quake in April 1906 left far more homeless.
   By winter, some 25,000 people still lived in tents around the
city. The Army Corps of Engineers eventually designed wooden
``earthquake shacks.''
   Why not again?
   For one thing, a lot in 1906 cost only $250.
   ``The opportunities for finding cheap land are much reduced from
those days, when many parts of the city were totally undeveloped,''
said Paul.

   A consumer health group asked Congress on
Thursday to cancel immediately a contract that makes Philip Morris
Companies, Inc. part of a National Archives campaign to celebrate
the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights.
   ``This joint venture smears the Bill of Rights with the blood of
all Americans killed as a result of smoking Marlboro and other
Philip Morris cigarettes,'' said Sidney Wolfe, director of Public
Citizen Health Research Group in a letter to Sen. Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M.
   Bingaman heads the Government Affairs Committee's subcommittee
on government information which has jurisdiction over the Archives.
   Guy L. Smith, vice president of corporate affairs for Philip
Morris, said in a telephone interview, ``The campaign has nothing
to do with cigarettes. It's about the celebration of the Bill of
Rights.''
   Don Wilson, archivist of the United States, said in a brief
written statement, ``The dialogue regarding our relationship with a
private corporation is a prime example of why the Bill of Rights is
important.''
   Wilson said he entered into the agreement because he wanted ``to
make this charter of freedom available to all Americans'' and
Philip Morris could support the educational effort.
   Philip Morris' Smith said his company already has gotten more
than 200,000 phone requests for copies of the document which Philip
Morris will provide.
   Wolfe, who founded the Health Research Group in 1971 with
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said, ``The National Archives'
decision to formally join Philip Morris' effort to wrap itself in
the Bill of Rights and obscure its deadly role in American and
worldwide society must be reversed.''
   The campaign gives Philip Morris the opportunity to be ``back on
the air again,'' despite a government ban on broadcast
advertisements for tobacco products, he said at a news conference.
He acknowledged the campaign doesn't include explicit advertising.
   Under the agreement, Philip Morris will donate $600,000 to the
National Archives Trust Fund and be allowed to publish or broadcast
announcements and promotional materials referring to the Archives.
The Archives will assist by providing recordings of famous
Americans' voices to be used in the campaign.
   A nationally televised public service announcement that is a
part of the campaign includes the voices of the late President
Kennedy, former Sen. Barry Goldwater and the late Martin Luther
King Jr. over images of the Bill of Rights and scenes from civil
rights demonstrations. The announcement identifies Philip Morris as
the sponsor.
   ``We are only identified at the very end and we consciously
separated the identification of the company from the messages about
the themes of the Bill of Rights,'' said Smith.
   ``What would Martin Luther King or Harry Truman think if they
knew their voices were being made available by the National
Archives in order to improve the image of a company with the deadly
record of Philip Morris?'' asked Wolfe in his letter.
   Wolfe said Archives staff members have told him $475,000 of the
company's contribution will go for an exhibit gallery in the
National Archives building and the remaining $125,000 will give the
company the first charter membership in an association, as yet to
be established, that will solicit corporate donations to do the
work of the Archives.
   Wolfe criticized commercialization of ``space in the building
which houses the symbols of our nation'' and said the formation of
``a National Archives Corporate Boosters' Club'' raises questions
about the importance Congress places on the basic documents of
American history if it won't provide adequate public funding for
the work of the government repository.

   Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, passed his
last formal leadership post to his chosen successor Thursday and
the Communist Party laid out an austere economic plan for the next
two years.
   Deng, 85, resigned as chairman of the party's powerful Central
Military Commission in favor of party chief Jiang Zemin. He still
heads the State Military Commission, a virtual mirror of the party
group, but said in a letter released Thursday he also would leave
that job.
   The move solidifies Jiang's position and appears at least to
suspend a reported power struggle between him and President Yang
Shangkun. Jiang, 63, had not held a national post until his
elevation to party leader after the pro-democracy movement was
crushed in June.
   In Washington, Richard Solomon, the assistant secretary of state
for East Asian affairs, said the United States was not surprised by
Deng's move and added, ``I suspect he will remain an influence.''
   ``You could say that the change wouldn't have occurred if there
wasn't a certain element of stability there,'' Solomon commented.
   Foreign diplomats and Chinese sources agree Deng is likely to
remain the leading voice in party and government affairs, as he has
been since leaving the Politburo and Central Committee in 1987.
   Yang, an 82-year-old former general with strong army
connections, was named vice chairman of the Central Military
Commission, which sets military policy. He is reported to have
sought the chairmanship to consolidate his power base.
   In another concession to Yang, a mastermind of the June military
crackdown, his younger brother Yang Baibing, an army political
commissar, was appointed secretary-general of the commission.
   Although Deng described Jiang, a former Shanghai party boss with
a weak power base in Beijing, as the ``nucleus'' of the new
leadership, many feel the party leader's political fortunes are
tied to Deng's physical health.
   Xinhua, the official news agency, quoted Deng's resignation
letter, dated Wednesday, as saying: ``As early as 1980, I proposed
reforming the leadership system of the party and state and
abolishing the life-long tenure of leading posts.
   ``I have insisted on not taking up day-to-day affairs and have
been looking forward to completing the succession of the older
generation by the younger generation as soon as possible and
realizing my aspiration of completely retiring from the leading
posts.''
   The Central Committee praised Deng as the ``chief architect in
all aspects of the party's and army's works.''
   A lengthy communique said he was ``an outstanding Marxist, a
staunch communist, a brilliant proletarian revolutionary statesman
and military strategist and a long-tested leader of the party and
state.''
   It said economic reforms Deng began a decade ago would continue,
but for at least two years the people must ``lead a thrifty life''
to fight inflation of nearly 20 percent annually, too-rapid growth
and corruption.
   The party outlined goals of lower consumption, tighter financial
control, realigned industrial structure and increased production.
   Deng's letter, in turn, lauded Jiang, who became head of the 48
million-member party after Zhao Ziyang was dismissed in June. Zhao,
Deng's former protege, was accused of being too close to the
pro-democracy movement.
   Of the party leadership, Deng said it had created ``a leading
nucleus headed by Comrade Jiang Zemin and it is now already
carrying out its work effectively.''
   Although it is possible Yang has been shunted aside, his strong
military ties are important because the army's power was enhanced
by the brutal June crackdown in which hundreds of people were
killed.
   In addition to having his brother beside him as the military
commission's secretary-general, he has an ally in the army chief of
staff, Chi Haotian, said to be his son-in-law.
   During the student-led protests that began in April, Deng and
Yang were the party military commission's chairman and junior vice
chairman, respectively. They prevailed over Zhao, the first vice
chairman, in having martial law declared and ultimately sending in
troops.
   Such a graphic illustration of how leaders could summon the army
to support their policies gave the commission new eminence in the
party power structure.
   In the southwestern city of Chengdu on Thursday, an official
said six people had been executed for participating in riots in
June. The executions brought to at least 18 the number of people
put to death in China after the pro-democracy movement was crushed.
   At Beijing University, which was a center of protest, students
with party membership were summoned to a meeting Thursday and
ordered to tell classmates not to use Deng's resignation as an
excuse for ``rash'' action, a student said.
   No incidents were reported on campus.
   ``We admire Deng Xiaoping, but it's good that he's stepping
down, since he's so old,'' said a student who was active in the
protests. ``He's a skillful statesman. We don't hate him, because
he wants reform in his heart, even though he took such harsh
measures back in June.''
   He said of Jiang: ``We don't dislike him. He's more like the
lesser of two evils.''

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas on Thursday said
the Afghan government resurrected a 9-year-old list of executed
political prisoners as a ploy to distance themselves from their
Marxist predecessors.
   Lord Nicholas Bethell, a British member of the European
Parliament, turned over a copy of the list to officials of the
insurgents' Afghan government-in-exile in Pakistan.
   Bethell said Afghan President Najib gave him the list containing
thousands of names on a visit to Kabul last week where he secured
the release of three rebel prisoners.
   An Afghan rebel spokesman in Pakistan, Najibullah Lafrey, said
the list was first published in 1980. ``I'm not sure what the
purpose of this is, except to try to distance themselves from the
past,'' he said.
   It contained names of thousands of people secret police executed
in the 20 months after the April 1978 coup that brought Communists
to power. It included two former prime ministers, Noor Ahmad
Etimadi and Mohammad Musa Shafiq.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979. They
installed a new leader, then remained to help fight a growing
anti-communist insurgency before withdrawing this year.
   Afghanistan's first Communist leaders were Nur Mohammad Taraki
and Hafizullah Amin of the Khalq faction of the People's Democratic
Party of Afghanistan. Both eventually were assassinated.
   The Soviets replaced Amin in 1979 with rival Babrak Karmal of
the party's Parcham wing. Najib, of the same faction, became head
of secret police for the next five years.
   Najib was installed as party chief in 1986 after Karmal stepped
down for health reasons.
   When Karmal issued the list of secret police victims in February
1980, it was seen as an attempt to discredit Karmal's predecessors.
It is still available in Kabul bookshops.
   Lefrey charged the list was being resurrected to further
distance Najib from his party's Communist revolutionary roots.
   The Kabul government in recent years has attempted to shed its
Marxist taint in favor of Islam, Afghanistan's dominant religion,
in an effort to broaden its support.
   But the guerrillas have fought bitterly to topple it and
establish an all-Moslem government.
   Bethell told The Associated Press that said some Kabul lawmakers
``mentioned there had been a list of 11,000 in the early years of
the revolution'' but he did not know whether his was a carbon copy
of the earlier one.
   ``While Najib was head of Khad he did much worse than what was
on that list,'' Lefrey charged. ``Some think the number of people
who have been executed is 70,000 to 80,000 in the past 10 years.''

   The absence of federal seafood inspection puts
U.S. fishermen at a competitive disadvantage and leaves consumers
unsure about the quality of fish, witnesses told a congressional
hearing Thursday.
   House Democrats representing coastal districts are pushing the
Bush administration to back a plan for federally funded inspections
to provide consumers the same quality assurances available for
chicken and beef.
   Administration officials told the Subcommittee on Fisheries and
Wildlife Conservation and the Environment that they have reached no
decision on the issue.
   ``The administration has not come to the conclusion that it is
not needed right now,'' said James Brennan of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration. But he added, ``The administration
has not come down on a position on what it wants to do.''
   Brennan's comment drew a sharp rebuke from the subcommittee
chairman, Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., who said, ``I don't think
we've had a matter of consequence before this committee on which
the administration has had a position.''
   The cost of a federally funded seafood inspection program could
range from $50 million to $80 million, according to Lester Crawford
of the Agriculture Department's Food Safety Inspection Service.
Currently the seafood industry pays about $6 million _ as much as
$100,000 per year for an individual company _ for seafood
inspections.
   Brennan said one reason for the administration's reluctance to
provide financing is that seafood inspection is a direct benefit to
the industry because it promotes consumer confidence.
   ``In essence we're talking about how to promote the U.S.
industry and whether the U.S. industry should pay for it,'' Brennan
said.
   Studds said that the beef and poultry industries benefit from
government-financed inspections while fishmermen must pay for their
own.
   Over eight years, the subcommittee said, consumption of
commercial seafood rose by 20 percent a year to a record high in
1987 of 15.4 pounds per capita.

   Farmers are completing a corn harvest
estimated at a three-year high of 7.59 billion bushels, up 54
percent from last year's drought-reduced crop and up 2 percent from
the forecast a month ago, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Drought reduced the 1988 corn crop to 4.92 billion bushels. In
October, the department estimated this year's production at 7.45
billion bushels, a 51 percent increase from last year.
   At 7.59 billion bushels the harvest would be the largest since
8.25 billion bushels in 1986. The record was the 1985 crop of
nearly 8.9 billion bushels.
   ``Harvest progressed rapidly in the 17 major producing states
during October and was 88 percent complete by Nov. 5, compared with
91 percent last year and the average of 78 percent,'' the
department's National Agricultural Statistics Service reported.
   Corn yields were estimated at 116.6 bushels per acre harvested,
up from 114.4 forecast in October and 84.6 bushels in 1988 but
still below the record of 119.4 bushels per acre in 1987.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop. It is essential for the production of meat, poultry and
dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 4.1 percent in
1988, are expected to go up about 6 percent this year, according to
USDA economists. The USDA has not issued its 1990 forecast, but
some analysts tentatively indicate food prices won't match this
year's rise, the steepest since a 7.8 percent jump in 1981.
   Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable
oil, was estimated at 1.94 billion bushels, up 25 percent from last
year's harvest of 1.54 billion bushels and 1 percent above the
October estimate of 1.93 billion bushels.
   The record soybean output was 2.26 billion bushels in 1979.
   Yields were estimated at an average of 32.8 bushels per acre
this year, compared with 26.9 bushels in 1988, the October forecast
of 32.6 bushels and a record 34.1 bushels per acre in 1985.
   The department's all-crops production index was reported at 104
percent of its 1977 average used for comparison. Last year,
reflecting the severe drought, the index plummeted to 89 percent.
The record reading was 117 percent set in 1981, 1982 and 1985.
   Cotton production was indicated at 12.1 million bales, down 21
percent from last year's output and 2 percent below the September
estimate of 12.3 million bales. The new estimate was up about 1
percent from October. The cotton record was 18.9 million bales in
1937.
   No new estimates of 1989 production of wheat and other crops
harvested earlier were included in the report.
   In a related report on supply and demand for major commodities,
analysts said total corn use in the 1989-90 marketing year that
began on Sept. 1 is expected to be about 7.625 billion bushels,
including domestic and export requirements, an increase from 7.5
billion forecast in October.
   With demand exceeding 1989 corn production, that will mean a
further drawdown of U.S. stockpiles to about 1.9 billion bushels
left over by next Sept. 1, down from inventories estimated at 1.93
billion bushels at the beginning of the marketing year.
   Still, that represents only a slight dip in the U.S. corn
stockpile, compared to last season's decline, when it plummeted
from 4.26 billion bushels on Sept. 1, 1988, to the 1.93 billion
bushels on hand this Sept. 1.
   Analysts said total corn use in the coming year will be boosted
by larger exports than had been anticipated, about 2.15 billion
bushels instead of the 2 billion that was forecast last month.
Larger imports by the Soviet Union are expected to account for a
much of the increase.
   The report said U.S. corn prices may average in the range of $2
to $2.40 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, down from $2.54
last season. The October forecast was $1.85 to $2.25 per bushel.
   Other 1989 crop estimates based on Oct. 1 indications, compared
with 1988 output, included:
   _Sorghum, 628.9 million bushels and an average yield of 59.8
bushels per acre, compared with 577.6 million and 63.8 in 1988.
   _Rice, 156.4 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,697 pounds
per acre, compared with 159.5 million and 5,511.
   _Peanuts, 4.13 billion pounds and a yield of 2,523 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.98 billion and 2,445.
   _Potatoes, total, 367.3 million hundredweight and a yield of 292
hundredweight per acre, compared with 356.4 million and 283.
   _Tobacco, 1.47 billion pounds and a yield of 2,105 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,160.
   _Sugarbeets, 26 million tons and a yield of 19.6 tons per acre,
compared with 24.8 million and 19.1.
   _Sugarcane, 30.4 million tons and a yield of 35.2 tons per acre,
compared with 29.9 million and 35.4.

<HEAD>Security Tightened to Curb Crime Before Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government on Thursday
stepped up security to curb a wave of crime that opposition leaders
say is a serious threat to next month's elections and the country's
transition to democratic rule.
   Police patrols were reinforced in this capital of 5 million
people, especially in areas where banks and shops are concentrated.
Police carrying submachine guns and wearing bulletproof vests were
seen in Santiago's center.
   Police said all vacations and days off were temporarily
suspended in the 29,000-member force.
   The government's reaction came after a series of often violent
robberies of banks, supermarkets, shops and private residences, and
several incidents of violence related to the current campaign for
the presidential and congressional elections scheduled for Dec. 14.
   Patricio Aylwin, the opposition presidential candidate, highly
favored by most polls to win, suggested radical pro-government
groups may be behind the crime wave.
   ``An atmosphere of violence and unrest only serves those who
know are going to lose'' the election, Aylwin said in southern
Chile, where he is campaigning.
   The election will mark the restoration of civilian rule in
Chile, which has been ruled by an authoritarian military regime
since the 1973 coup led by right-wing President Gen. Augusto
Pinochet.
   Police records show violent incidents have occurred almost daily
for five weeks. On Wednesday, two armed men wearing ski masks
entered the home of Enrique Silva, a leading opposition politician,
severely beat his wife and fled.
   Wilson Tapia, Silva's son-in-law, said the men first demanded
money and jewels but then fled with only a box containing family
documents and souvenirs. Tapia said ``the men did not look like
common criminals.''
   Earlier this month, similar incidents occurred at the homes of
two well-known television journalists.
   In the most serious political incident, Jecar Neghme, leader of
a radical leftist group, was assasinated Sept. 30. No arrests have
been reported.
   After the incident at Silva's residence opposition leaders said
the series of violent crimes may be part of an effort to interfere
in the election campaign.
   The coalition of 17 parties supporting Aylwin said in a
statement: ``These criminal actions constitute a suspicious pattern
of provocations and an apparently well-planned effort to scare and
alarm citizens.''
   Mario Astorga, Vice President of Silva's Radical Party, claimed
his party has information that members of the government's secret
police ``are operating in this situations.'' He did not elaborate.
   Former Finance Minister Hernan Buchi, the pro-government
presidential candidate, said the incident at Silva's home ``is more
than just a common crime. It can be interpreted as an attack on the
process of democratic restoration.''
   He said ``the government has the obligation'' of investigating
and arresting the attackers.
   The government said it will ``ensure the country's tranquility
and security and will maintain public order'' during the campaign
and until the inauguration of the new government next March 11.
   Col. Cristian Labbe, the government's Secretary General, accused
the opposition of trying to ``make political gains from a situation
that worries the entire country.''
   Pinochet was obliged to call the election after last year's
referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal to extend
his rule until 1997.

<HEAD>Aerosol Deodorants Will Be Illegal After 1995 Unless Safe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aerosol deodorants will be banned in
California within six years, unless their makers can find
alternatives to harmful air pollutants emitted by the spray cans, a
state regulatory agency ruled.
   The decision Wednesday by the Air Resources Board was its first
step in adopting a plan to reduce pollution from a variety of
consumer aerosol products. The board ordered an 80 percent cut in
hydrocarbons found in spray cans by Jan. 1, 1995.
   ``This landmark action requires manufacturers to use more
environmentally acceptable substitutes if they choose to continue
selling aerosols and will likely set a precedent for other consumer
product actions that follow,'' board Chairwoman Jananne Sharpless
said in a statement.
   Hydrocarbons, one of many sources of smog and other pollution
that scientists say harm human lungs, are used as a propellant in
many spray products.
   Only a very few hydrocarbons are known to harm the Earth's
ozone. They became popular after 1978 when chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, were banned in the United States because of their danger to
the ozone layer.
   Representatives of the aerosol industry attacked the decision,
saying it would force them to withdraw some products from the
California market.
   Other new regulations under consideration for household products
and for fuels and industrial processes include a proposed
regulation to control smoke from wood stoves in homes.
   Aerosol products, from hair spray to pesticides, will come under
board scrutiny in coming months, Sharpless said. Wednesday's
decision applied to deodorants.
   The agency is not attempting to ``pass a judgment on any
particular type of product'' or put manufacturers out of business,
she said.
   Sharpless called higher prices that could result from the
regulation the price consumers must pay for a safe environment.
   The board heard from a number of industry representatives who
said the deadlines were unrealistic and that some companies may
have to take their products out of the California market.
   The board, nonetheless, voted 6-2 to adopt the
deodorant-antiperspirant regulation. The dissenters, Dr. Eugene
Boston of Fullerton and Mayor Roberta Hughan of Gilroy, said they
were voting ``no'' because they wanted a tougher regulation.
   The 1995 ban is part of a complex regulation that would allow
exceptions for manufacturers to keep some polluting aerosol
products on the market until 1999.

<HEAD>Foley Sees Congressional Pay Raise Despite Budget Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: SUBS last two grafs to CORRECT pay history; expands lead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said Thursday
that Congress will consider giving itself a pay raise even if it
fails to resolve the budget crisis that has the Pentagon
threatening tens of thousands of layoffs.
   But other lawmakers said passing the pay raise and ethics reform
package is already a politically dicey proposition and could fail
unless Congress first puts the government's fiscal affairs in
better order.
   Foley, D-Wash., has been meeting with leaders of both parties in
an effort to push through a pay raise this year as part of a
package that also would tighten congressional ethics regulations,
including clamping down on accepting fees for speeches to interest
groups.
   Foley and House Republican leaders have been working with the
White House to craft a package acceptable to the Senate and to
President Bush. Last week, Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
indicated the president's willingness to look at such a proposal
but the president himself was silent.
   ``I think when the time comes... the president will be
forthcoming in his support,'' Foley said.
   Members of Congress are paid $89,500 a year. A plan to boost
salaries by 51 percent was killed earlier this year after a storm
of public protest.
   The House leadership has been briefing members this week on
their new plan, which includes a pay raise of about 8 percent to go
into effect January 1 and another 25 percent boost a year later.
The raise would apply to members of Congress, federal judges, and
top executive branch officials.
   Foley said he thought the package could be brought before the
full House as early as next week. He said it would move forward
even if Congress has failed to address government-wide spending
cuts ordered last month because lawmakers have failed to reduce the
federal deficit.
   ``That is a separate matter ... I don't think we are likely to
see any direct connection between the two,'' Foley said.
   Those cutbacks, required by the Gramm-Rudman law, cut many
domestic and military programs. Pentagon officials testified this
week that the 2.1 million active duty armed forces would have to be
reduced by about 229,000 in the next year.
   The Democratic-controlled Congress and the president are
currently in negotiations over a deficit-reduction bill which would
cancel those cutbacks. House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta, D-Wash., said he hoped to produce a bill by the end of
next week.
   If that effort fails, he said he thought passage of a pay
increase was unlikely.
   ``Whether people like it or not, the two issues are tied very
closely together,'' he said.
   What could become untied in the future is the salary of House
and Senate members.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine., and Republican
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said this week the Senate would accept,
perhaps without even a vote, a ``cost-of-living'' adjustment _
which is what the House leaders are calling the 8 percent raise
next January.
   Senators generally are wealthier than House members, and their
rules allow them to keep more speaking fees than their colleagues
across the Capitol.
   ``There's not a lot of support in the Senate for a pay raise,''
Mitchell said.
   If the Congress approved a pay raise for the House and not the
Senate, ``It would be odd,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who
said he supports raising Senate salaries and eliminating the
acceptance of honoraria.
   But it would not be unprecedented. From Dec. 21, 1982 through
July 1, 1983, House members were paid $69,800 and the Senate
$60,662.

<HEAD>Trenton Mayor Arthur Holland, Former U.S. Mayors Conference President,
Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Arthur Holland, a former president of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors who headed the city's government for
26 of the last 30 years, died Thursday after a long struggle with
cancer. He was 71.
   Holland died at St. Francis Medical Center in Trenton, where he
was admitted Sept. 12.
   The popular mayor was known as ``Honest Art'' and ``Mr. Clean''
for his scandal-free administrations. His open-door government
often involved personal meetings with residents, and he developed a
national reputation as an advocate for urban America.
   Gov. Thomas H. Kean ordered flags on state buildings lowered to
half-staff.
   City Council President Carmen Armenti, who unseated Holland in
1966 and was in turn defeated by him in 1970, became acting mayor.
   Holland, who had had several bouts with cancer, revealed in June
that he had inoperable lymphatic cancer. That same month, he
completed a one-year term as president of the mayors' group.
   Holland said he would not run for re-election as mayor, but
promised to continue working as much as possible. He kept a full
schedule until his hospitalization.
   Born in Trenton, Holland spent six years at a seminary, but did
not enter the priesthood.
   He began his city government career in 1951 as deputy director
of public affairs. He was elected to the City Council in 1955 and
won his first mayoral election in 1959.
   To demonstrate the sincerity of his commitment to civil rights,
Holland in 1964 moved his family into a run-down, racially mixed
neighborhood.
   Possibly hurt by the move, Holland suffered his only mayoral
defeat in 1966 in the loss to Armenti.
   In the next four years, Holland taught at Rutgers University and
worked as consultant.
   During that time, Trenton endured race riots that followed the
1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   Holland recaptured City Hall in 1970, and received few
challenges after that.
   He is survived by his wife of 27 years, Betty, who
unsuccessfully ran for Congress last year against Republican
incumbent Christopher Smith. He is also survived by the couple's
three sons, Matthew, Christopher, and Timothy; and two daughters,
Cynthia and Elise.
   A public viewing was scheduled Sunday at City Hall, and a
funeral was set for Monday at Sacred Heart Church in Trenton.

<TEXT>
   A Bush administration official testified
Thursday against a proposal that the government issue ``work
authorization cards'' on request both to citizens and to aliens
eligible to work in this country.
   Such cards would be used largely by immigrants, distinguishing
those who are in this country legally from those who are here
illicitly.
   ``This could lead to discrimination against those individuals
who do not have the card,'' said Paul W. Virtue, acting general
counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   He added that such a card might be viewed as a national identity
card, which Congress has forbidden.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., who sponsored the proposal for
a work authorization card, said that Social Security cards are used
much like identity cards.
   Morrison said the card he proposed would help prevent fraud and
discourage employers from discriminating against various groups.
   They spoke at a hearing of the subcommittee on Immigration,
which Morrison chairs. The subcommittee is part of the House
Judiciary Committee.
   Opposition to Morrison's idea also came from the General
Accounting Office, an investigative agency of Congress, and from
the American Civil Liberties Union.
   But there was favorable comment from the National Restaurant
Association.

   President Yang Shangkun gave a dinner for Henry
Kissinger on Thursday and the former secretary of state thanked him
for a cold remedy provided a year ago.
   Reporters allowed to cover the beginning of the meeting at a
government-run hotel overheard this exchange between Kissinger and
the 82-year-old former general:
   Kissinger: You look very well. I haven't seen you for a long
time _ one year. You gave me some medicine. ... It was very

   Yang: The best way to overcome a cold is to have a good sleep,
then no cold tomorrow.
   Li Jinhua, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said Kissinger
renewed acquaintances earlier in the day with Premier Li Peng and
Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin.
   She said the former secretary of state and Jiang ``held friendly
and cordial talks on major issues of mutual interest.''
   ``Both were very glad to meet again in Beijing and recall their
friendship,'' Ms. Li said.
   Li Peng and Kissinger ``exchanged views extensively and in-depth
on issues of economic construction and other issues of mutual
interest,'' she said.
   Kissinger is making what is believed to be his 15th trip to
China since a secret visit in 1971 that set the stage for
normalization of relations between the two countries.
   He was scheduled to meet on Friday with senior leader Deng
Xiaoping and Li Tieying, the education minister.

<HEAD>Harvest Above Expectations, but Imports Still Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Thursday that
the Soviet Union's 1989 grain harvest turned out larger than
predicted but that Moscow still must import huge amounts of grain
in the year ahead.
   Currently, the department expects the Soviet harvest to total
208 million metric tons, an increase of three million tons from the
previous forecast.
   That would compare with 195.1 million tons in 1988 and would be
the fifth largest Soviet harvest on record, exceeded by 237.4
million tons in 1978, 223.8 million in 1976, 211.4 million in 1987,
and 210.1 million in 1986.
   Production of rye, barley, oats, corn, sorghum and millet _
so-called coarse grain _ was indicated at 105.5 million tons, up
2.5 million from the previous forecast in October. Wheat output was
unchanged at 89 million tons, but miscellaneous grain was increased
by 500,000 tons to 13.5 million.
   Total grain imports by the Soviet Union in the 1989-90 trade
year, which began July 1, were estimated at 37 million tons, up
three million from earlier. That would still be short of the 39
million tons imported in 1987-88 and the record 55.5 million in
1984-85.
   No specific breakdown showing U.S. shares of the Soviet trade
was included, but the report noted that Moscow was recently cleared
to buy 16 million tons of U.S. grain in 1989-90 under a long-term
agreement.
   However, the agreement year began on Oct. 1, so the comparisons
are not exact. In 1988-89, the Soviets bought a record of 21.7
million tons of U.S. wheat and corn, and so far this year have
purchased 8.1 million tons for 1989-90 delivery.

   A congresswoman Thursday questioned the Navy's
decision to make the skipper of the USS Iowa eligible for another
major command in light of inquiries into the battleship blast that
killed 47 sailors.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said she was asking Navy Secretary
Lawrence Garrett III to explain the ``alleged selection'' of Capt.
Fred P. Moosally for sequential major command.
   The Navy investigation concluded that gunner's mate Clayton
Hartwig of Ohio ``most likely'' caused the April 19 explosion by
inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one
of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   Members of Congress, Hartwig's family and shipmates have
criticized the report. Oakar has asked the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to review the Navy's
findings.
   The Navy screening board that took the action on Moosally
includes Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who headed the service's
investigation into the explosion, Oakar said.
   ``I realize that consideration and possible selection of Capt.
Moosally does not commit the Navy to consider him for sequential
major command, but I question the propriety of such action while
there are several congressional and Navy investigations ongoing,''
Oakar said.
   Moosally, Oakar said, received a non-punitive ``letter of
admonition'' Oct. 3 after an administrative hearing on the Iowa
explosion.
   A sequential major command for a Navy officer would be a move
from commanding a cruiser or battleship to another similar command,
Navy officials said.
   ``The selection or non-selection of an individual is predicated
on his or her past performance and an individual's entire career
and his or her performance during that entire career is
considered,'' said Cmdr. Craig Quigley at the Pentagon.
   ``If someone is selected, that means they are just eligible,''
Quigley said.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of a House Armed
Services subcommittee that's reviewing the matter, cited an FBI
report that said its laboratory inquiry was inconclusive about what
caused the explosion.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee will question Milligan,
Moosally and Robert J. Powers, who heads the criminal division of
the Naval Investigative Service, at a hearing Nov. 16.

   A senator delayed action Thursday on President
Bush's choice to be ambassador to Barbados, saying the nominee's
only qualification was that she made large contributions to the
Republican Party.
   ``I'm out to put an end to this ... ambassadorial spoils
system,'' Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee about the nomination of Joy Silverman.
   ``There are no qualifications for this lady,'' Sarbanes said.
``There's nothing there. There's no `there' there.''
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-N.Y., defended the nomination, saying
Bush made it because of his friendship with Mrs. Silverman not
because she was a large GOP contributor.
   Sarbanes, exercising his rights under the rules of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, blocked committee action for at least
a week. But some Republicans said they feared the Senate might be
prevented from acting at all because the current session of
Congress is nearing an end.
   Sarbanes said Mrs. Silverman, and her husband, Jeffrey, gave
about $300,000 to the national Republican Party in 1987 and 1988.
That figure, he said, didn't include other large contributions to
GOP candidates in New York state and New York City.
   Jeffrey Silverman's company, Ply Gem Industries Inc. of New York
City, made other large contributions to Republican causes, many of
which have not been identified, Sarbanes said.
   The Silvermans also arranged a $100,000 corporate loan in
December 1988 to President Bush's inaugural committee about the
same time Mrs. Silverman was making clear her interest in an
ambassadorship, Sarbanes said.
   The interest-free loan, which had been solicited with about 200
others for ``seed money'' to plan and arrange inaugural events, was
repaid a month later, Sarbanes said.
   The Silvermans are members of Team 100, people who have
contributed $100,000 or more to the Republican National Committee.
   Sarbanes said the many prominent figures who wrote letters
urging that Mrs. Silverman be named an ambassador cited no other
qualifications than her abilities as a GOP fund-raiser.
   In her submission to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Mrs. Silverman said she was qualified for the post because she had
``assisted my husband by planning and hosting corporate functions.''
   Sarbanes has opposed several of Bush's nominees on grounds they
had no apparent qualifications except their large political
contributions.
   He said there are 41 women in the senior service of the U.S.
Foreign Service, all highly qualified and experienced. None has
been named by Bush as an ambassador.

<HEAD>Namibians Crawl, Ford Rivers to Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One woman crawled to the polls. Some
people waded across rivers. Others camped overnight at polling
stations as Namibians displayed a fierce determination to vote in
their first open elections.
   Namibians have peacefully endured hours of searing heat, wind
and dust in milelong lines to vote for an assembly that will write
a constitution paving the way for independence from South Africa.
   ``Perhaps I can, hopefully, in the end of this exercise, say
that this has been the most democratic elections in the world,''
U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari said Thursday after
touring polling booths in northern Namibia.
   The United Nations is supervising the independence process in
the territory, which South Africa has ruled for 74 years. No date
for independence has been set, but independence is expected to be
early next year.
   By Thursday, the third day of 5-day elections, more than 60
percent of the 701,483 registered voters had cast ballots,
according to Ahtisaari and territorial officials.
   Ahtisaari flew to the northern Ovambo district, Namibia's most
populous area, and was told that 75 percent of those registered in
the region already had voted.
   ``I think it indicates how dedicated the Namibians are, how
anxious they have been to use their democratic right in this
election,'' he remarked.
   Namibia's South African administrator, Louis Pienaar, predicted
Wednesday the voter turnout would be nearly 100 percent by the time
polls closed Saturday.
   Lines were much shorter Thursday, but the queues snaking along
sandy village and township roads during the previous two days
showed the variety of peoples who populate the territory.
   Diminutive Bushmen, clay-covered Himba women with animal-skin
aprons, tall Herero women in Victorian-style dresses, and city
dwellers in T-shirts declaring ``My vote is my secret'' _ all stood
in line, quietly, patiently and with good humor.
   No reports of serious political violence and few instances of
intimidation emerged. Election code violations have occurred, such
as anonymous smear pamphlets aimed at discrediting the South-West
Africa People's Organization, the election favorite.
   SWAPO President Sam Nujoma said before voting began that the
organization would accept any outcome certified by the United
Nations.
   The key election issue is whether SWAPO will win two-thirds of
the vote necessary to write a constitution without consulting the
other nine parties.
   Polling stations in the northern region have no electricity or
phones. Some were set up by teams flown in by helicopter. Water
trucks and candles were brought in.
   Near Oshakati, a lame woman who had come without friends crawled
toward the polling booth Wednesday. In another Ovambo village a
crippled man pushed himself along with his hands.
   A U.N. official in the northeastern town of Rundu said voters
crossed the Okavango River in small canoes or waded across it.
   People who live in neighboring countries can vote if they or
their parents were born in Namibia or if they resided in the
territory for four years.
   U.N. Regional Director Linda Cohen said the Kavango people, most
of whom haven't voted in a century of colonial rule, began arriving
at the Rundu polling station more than eight hours before it opened.
   ``They were just excited. They wanted to be the first,'' she
said. ``They've been waiting a long time for this to happen.''

   East Berliners reacted with astonishment to the
announcement Thursday that their Communist government was allowing
them to travel freely to the West for the first time in decades.
   ``Is it really true?'' asked Mario Schmidt.
   ``Show me the ADN report,'' the 18-year-old demanded, seizing a
copy of the news as reported by East Germany's official news agency.
   ``Why don't they just tear the wall down right away?'' said
student Birgit Grosspetzsch, 18, referring to the Berlin Wall built
in 1961 by East Germany to keep its citizens from going West.
   Late Thursday, about 100 East Germans gathered at the
Brandenburg Gate, the huge monument just over the Berlin Wall in
East Berlin.
   ``Open the gate! Open the gate!'' they chanted.
   Two sisters whose last trip West was to the funeral of their
grandmother in West Berlin in 1966 were so happy that tears of joy
brimmed in their eyes.
   ``We're going to the friends in West Berlin as soon as we can,''
said the older sister, aged 56. ``Really great,'' added her
44-year-old sister.
   West German police said about 100 East Germans had already
crossed through Berlin Wall crossing points, while other East
Germans apparently waited for police offices that issue visas to
open in the morning. The government announcement came after the
offices closed.
   Guenter Schabowski, a member of the ruling Politburo, announced
that East Germany's heavily fortified frontier with West Germany
would be opened as a provisional step until a law is passed to
allow greater freedom of travel.
   The decision means all East Germans ``can travel over all East
German border checkpoints,'' including through the Berlin Wall,
Schabowski told reporters in East Berlin.
   Schabowski did not say when the law would be passed.
   Several young people thought the news would help to stem the
mass exodus to the West. More than 200,000 have fled for the West
so far this year, including 50,000 who have escaped through
Czechoslovakia since Saturday.
   ``I think that even some of those who left recently will come
back now,'' said a 25-year-old electrician who gave his name only
as Thomas.
   He had just heard the news from his mother, who made immediate
plans to visit his brother, one of the tens of thousands of people
who have fled West in recent weeks through Hungary and
Czechoslovakia.
   ``I'll be off to visit my brother in Munich,'' he beamed. ``But
I'll come back. I think many people will think about that now,
where so much is changing here.''
   Another mother, Brigitte Hinze, made immediate plans to take
underwear to her 19-year-old son, who fled to West Berlin through
Prague last week. She was carrying the garments in a plastic bag,
ready to mail off, when she heard the news.
   ``Now I'm going to visit as soon as I can,'' she said, her voice
shaking. ``I'm so happy.''
   Uwe Landgraf, 28, made plans for a trip to Paris. ``Now I no
longer feel locked in here.''
   Sabine, a 22-year-old secretary, also named France as her first
destination.
   ``Now I can get to know countries that we only ever saw on maps
or heard about at school,'' she said.
   Several of those hearing the news at East Berlin's Schoenhauser
Allee metro station said they believed West Germans also would be
happy.
   ``They can't cope any more,'' Thomas said.
   West German officials have said their reception centers are
overflowing with the East Germans who have come West just since
their Communist government allowed them out through Czechoslovakia
last Friday.
   Although relaxing travel restrictions would satisfy one of the
central demands of dissatisfied East Germans, others remain.
Demonstrators have demanded free elections and the end of the
Communists 40-year monopoly on power.
   ``One party, that's a dictatorship, and nothing will change,''
said an 80-year-old widow. ``We need a multiparty government.''
   ``We've got to get the right people in there _ then we can start
talking,'' said Wolfgang Karek, 50, a newspaper vendor and
part-time musician.
   Communist leader Egon Krenz on Thursday urged a new law ensuring
free and democratic elections. But he did not say whether he was
urging a true multiparty system.
   Despite the jubilation over the prospect of free travel, East
Berliners remain skeptical of promised reforms, having heard too
many promises from the Communists before to believe in fundamental
change now.
   ``The changes are not yet really what we want,'' said a canteen
worker in his 50s. ``We need completely new people _ we've seen
where it led with the old lot.''
   ``You can forget him,'' a 70-year-old retired trade worker said
of Krenz. ``Just a puppet like all the rest of them. For the
moment, he's the only man possible, but he won't last.''

<TEXT>
   Three scientists, including former space
shuttle astronaut Sally K. Ride, on Thursday challenged the Bush
administration argument that nuclear-tipped sea-launched cruise
missiles cannot be detected on vessels.
   In an article in Science Magazine, the scientists endorsed a
Soviet argument that a total ban on those missiles could be
verified under a proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)
now under superpower negotiation.
   ``The verification of arms control limits on nuclear-armed SLCMs
(sea-launched cruise missiles) does not present insuperable
problems and can be accomplished at a level of both effectiveness
and intrusiveness, which is likely to be characteristic of the
other verification provisions of START,'' said the article by Ride
and fellow physcists George N. Lewis and John S. Townsend.
   Ride left the shuttle program and is a professor of physics at
the University of California at San Diego.
   Matt Murphy, a spokesman for the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said officials were studying the article and
had no immediate comment.
   Navy officers in particular have opposed including the missiles
in START because they do not want Soviet inspectors aboard U.S.
submarines and because they say it would be easy to circumvent a
ban or reduction.
   The article contested that contention, proposing a detailed plan
to inspect missiles at their point of origin, tag and seal them,
and provide for inspections no more intrusive than others
envisioned under START.
   Last September, the Soviets withdrew their insistence that the
sea-launched cruise missile ban be included in START, but said they
wanted a separate SLCM deal.
   Bush administration officals have said a START pact, to reduce
superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent, might be
ready by the time of a planned summit next spring or summer.
   The United States has approximately 370 nuclear and 1,670
long-range Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles that can be fired
from about 70 U.S. surface ships and submarines and have a range of
about 1,600 miles, the article said.
   The Soviet Union has an estimated 400 short-range nuclear SLCMs
and has deployed a smaller number of nuclear SS-N-21 missiles, with
a range of about 1,800 miles, it said.
   The article said that such missiles ``cannot be readily, or
safely, moved about or hidden on such ships.''
   ``Furthermore, conversion of a Tomahawk from conventional to
nuclear, although technically feasible, would be a complex and
time-consuming operation that, pratically speaking, could be
performed only at a factory,'' it said.
   ``Considerations such as these, taken together, suggest that
SLCM verification is not the intractable problem it is often
presented to be and that effective monitoring of SLCM deployments
is possible without an unprecedented degree of intrusiveness,'' it
said.
   ``Inspecting, tagging and sealing of SLCMs would be carried out
in a special verification facility,'' it said.
   At each facility, superpower inspectors would assure that
missiles were not nuclear and could not be changed at sea. Gamma
ray levels from nuclear-armed SLCMs are sufficient to alert
inspectors to deception, it said.
   Additionally, it said, scientists at the U.S. Sandia National
Laboratory had developed a tag that could give each missile a
distinctive ``fingerprint'' that would be read by shining a light
at it from different angles.
   Similarly, it said, a tamperproof seal consisting of optic
fibers had been developed to allow inspectors to assure that a
missile had not been armed with a nuclear warhead.
   To break the ban, it said, ``a potential cheater'' would have to
build a secret production facility, conduct clandestine tests, and
covertly transport and deploy the missiles.
   ``Each of these steps would involve risks. Collectively they
would represent a substantial level of activity, which would be
difficult to hide,'' it said.
   Moreover, it said, ``the military significance of covertly
produced nuclear SLCMs should not be exaggerated. Nuclear-armed
SLCMs would need to be hidden on land rather than at sea, and ``in
a rapidly developing crisis, covert SLCMs would not be available
for use.''
   ``There would be little incentive to attempt such cheating,
since doing so would provide little in the way of reliable,
available military capabilities that are not already provided by
other weapons. ...'' it said.

   The Army said Thursday that it had grounded
its fleet of AH-64 ``Apache'' attack helicopters after a flaw was
discovered on two of the gunships during maintenance inspections.
   The Army said in a statement released at the Pentagon that the
grounding of the 526 choppers, expected to last a few days, was a
precautionary measure because a cracked retention nut was found on
the two helicopters.
   The Apache is the Army's newest and most sophisticated
helicopter gunship.
   Army spokesman Maj. Barry Bomier said no accidents had been
reported because of the problem, adding that it was the fourth
grounding of the entire Apache fleet.
   The fleet, based throughout the United States and Europe, was
grounded twice in 1986 and once earlier this year after an accident
in which a piece of sheet metal struck a gunship's rotor blade.
   The grounding will remain in effect until an analysis of the
part is completed at the U.S. Army Aviation Systems Command in St.
Louis, Mo. The analysis should result in information to identify
the proper procedure for maintenance crews to follow, Bomier said.
   The part, known as the main rotor hub retention nut, holds the
rotor onto the shaft of the aircraft, Bomier said.
   The co-pilot of an Army Nation Guard AH-64 was killed and the
pilot seriously injured in a June 29 crash in northern Florida when
the tail rotor came off the aircraft.
   The Army said its investigation found that a piece of sheet
metal used to help secure a door had been improperly stored and
that the piece of metal became dislodged and flew into the AH-64's
tail rotor system.
   The choppers, built by McDonnell Douglas _ formerly Hughes
Helicopters _ cost about $13 million each.
   The gunship was commissioned to replace the Cobra as the Army's
primary attack helicopter. The twin-engined Apache, designed to
destroy enemy tanks, carries Hellfire and Hydra 7 missiles and a
30mm cannon.

<HEAD>Food Costs Lead Wholesale Prices to 0.4 Percent Rise</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS September to October in 12th graf, Economists said</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in October
as the biggest spurt in food costs in 22 months offset the positive
effects from moderating energy prices, the government reported
Thursday.
   While the increase in the Labor Department's Producer Price
Index was double what economists had been expecting, most of them
stressed that they saw no reason for worries that inflationary
pressures are threatening to get out of hand.
   The 0.4 percent October rise was down from a giant 0.9 percent
September increase and many economists predicted that the news on
inflation will continue to improve in coming months as a slowing
economy takes more pressure off prices.
   For the first 10 months of this year, prices at the wholesale
level have been rising at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, compared
to an increase of 4 percent in 1988.
   Stacy Kottman, an economist at Georgia State University, said
that he looked for wholesale inflation to return to an annual rate
of 4 percent in 1990.
   ``Assuming that food and energy prices remain relatively stable,
we expect further moderation in prices,'' he said. ``We don't see
any reason for prices to vault upward.''
   Virtually all of the price pressure last month came from a sharp
1.4 percent jump in food costs, reflecting a 18.9 percent surge in
vegetable prices that analysts blamed on weather problems in
California and Florida. Fruit, pork and fish prices also took a
jump upward.
   The overall food advance was the biggest since a 1.5 percent
spike in January 1988, but analysts noted that food costs had
actually dropped in three of the previous four months. They called
the October increase a temporary aberration and not a signal of
spiraling food costs ahead.
   Energy costs, which had soared 6.5 percent in September,
moderated in October, posting a modest 0.2 percent advance.
Gasoline prices rose 2.3 percent but the cost of natural gas fell
2.5 percent while home heating oil prices edged down 0.5 percent.
   Wholesale prices, excluding energy and food costs, were up a
tiny 0.1 percent in October. Many analysts consider this figure a
better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures because both food
and energy prices are volatile from month to month.
   New car prices fell by 1.4 percent in October as the new models
were introduced, reflecting efforts by automakers to overcome
sluggish demand by keeping a lid on price increases.
   Economists said the October wholesale price report provided
support for the decision this week by the Federal Reserve to lower
interest rates in an effort to spur the economy.
   While the Bush administration has been pressuring the central
bank to lower rates in order to keep the country out of a
recession, the Fed had been resisting those moves because of fears
that inflationary pressures were still too high.
   But many private economists said they believed the Fed's rate
reduction this week was appropriate given widespread evidence of
economic weakness, particularly in the U.S. manufacturing sector,
and reports showing that inflation is moderating.
   However, Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell said
Thursday that he believed that inflation needs to be reduced
further, calling the current rate of increase in consumer prices
``too high.''
   He called for consumer price increases to be shaved to the range
of 3 percent, saying this goal would be acheived in the first half
of 1990. So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an
annual rate of 4.4 percent.
   Analysts said that Angell's comments indicated that the Fed may
be prepared to wait awhile before following this week's interest
rate cut with further reductions.
   The Producer Price Index reflects the cost of goods one stop
short of retail. Before adjusting for normal seasonal variation,
the PPI stood at 114.8 in October, meaning that a marketbasket of
goods costing $100 in the base year of 1982 would have cost $114.80
last month, up from $109.40 a year ago.

<HEAD>New U.S. Ambassador Says Libyans Pose No Special Security Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new U.S. ambassador to Malta said
Thursday she does not believe that visiting Libyans in Malta pose
any special security risk for next month's superpower summit.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are
scheduled to hold shipboard meetings off Malta on Dec. 2-3.
   Ambassador Sally Novetzke, who presented her credentials
Thursday to President Vincent Tabone, also said she considers it
unlikely any meeting would be arranged between Bush and Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi during the summit.
   The Socialist Party leader and former prime minister, Karmenu
Mifsud Bonnici, on Wednesday called on the government to try to
arrange a Bush-Gadhafi meeting in an effort ``to reduce tensions
between the two countries.''
   The Bush administration has said previously it was not prepared
to hold talks with Libya. It said last month that Libya is still
providing funds, weapons, haven and training facilities to
terrorists.
   Bonnici was the prime minister in April 1986, when Malta gave
Libya advance warning of the U.S. air raids on the Libyan cities of
Benghazi and Tripoli.
   However, Libya apparently did not act on the information.
Then-President Reagan said the bombing raids were intended to
punish Libya for its alleged support of international terrorism.
   The Socialists were voted out in 1986 after 16 years in power
and the conservative government of Prime Minister Eddie Fenech
Adami has moved closer to the United States and Western Europe.
   Mrs. Novetzke said the fact that Libyans are allowed to freely
visit Malta does not pose any special security risk for the summit.
``It is not a worry,'' she said.

   About 1,000 protesters burned
effigies of President Corazon Aquino and Uncle Sam on Thursday and
carried banners reading ``Yankee Go Home'' in demanding that the
country's six U.S. bases be closed.
   The protest in front of the U.S. Embassy took place before Mrs.
Aquino met President Bush in Washington for two hours of talks that
included the future of the military bases, whose lease expires in
1991.
   U.S. and Filipino negotiators are expected to begin talks in
Manila next month on extending the bases. Mrs. Aquino refuses to
say whether she wants a new agreement.
   Sen. Wigberto Tanada, a member of the pro-Aquino coalition, told
the rally that even if Mrs. Aquino supported a new agreement, the
Senate would disapprove it.
   The constitution requires approval of any bases agreement by
two-thirds of the 23-member Senate. Tanada told the crowd 10
senators were committed to dismantling the bases in 1991 and he

<HEAD>Judge Approves $2.35 Million Pan Am Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday approved a $2.35
million settlement for 117 female flight attendants who sued Pan
American World Airways for using stricter weight standards for them
than for men.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said the settlement was
fundamentally fair and highly favorable to the attendants despite
objections from six women whose damage claims were fully or
partially denied.
   The settlement will be shared by 117 women who were suspended,
fired or denied promotions because of the weight policy, said
Kathleen King, an attorney for the Independent Union of Flight
Attendants.
   Pan Am also agreed to liberalize weight standards for current or
future employees.
   The former policy used a 1959 insurance company table of heights
and weights, but judged men under the standard for large frames and
women under the standard for medium frames. A 5-foot-7 woman was
allowed to weigh 139 pounds under the medium standard, but would
have been allowed to weigh 150 under the large standard.
   The flight attendants' union sued Pan Am in 1984, and won a
ruling from Henderson three years later in a non-jury trial that
the policy was biased.
   The ruling was the first to find discrimination by an airline
that had weight policies for both men and women, Pan Am attorney
Richard Schoolman said at the time.
   Henderson ordered the airline to use a large-frame standard for
all employees hired while the policy was in effect, through the end
of 1984.
   Pan Am appealed Henderson's ruling, denying it had
discriminated. The appeal is being dropped as part of the
settlement, without any admission of discrimination.
   The settlement retains Henderson's previous order on weight
standards and also increases some of the standards adopted by the
airline in 1985, when it started setting weight requirements
according to an employee's individual build. In addition, women
hired after 1985 get another three-pound allowance at ages 35, 45
and 55.
   Although $2.5 million was less than the women might have gotten
in individual damage claims, Henderson said it was reasonable in
light of the time an appeal would have taken and the risk that the
entire amount would have been thrown out on appeal.

<HEAD>Cheney Approves Cutback in Number of Dependents</HEAD>
<HEAD>Desk: SUBS last graf with three grafs to reflect new Pentagon statement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has approved a
proposal from the top U.S. commander in Panama to cut the number of
military dependents in the troubled region, the Pentagon announced
Thursday.
   Cheney's decision means that the majority of U.S. service
personnel in Panama will not be accompanied by family members and
that only about 300 to 500 men and women in so-called ``key and
essential positions'' will be allowed to bring dependents.
   The withdrawal of dependents began last spring following a
series of incidents, including harassment and assaults against
Americans.
   But the new military commander in the region, Gen. Maxwell
Thurman, suggested a further speed-up in the withdrawal following
the failed coup attempt on Oct. 3 against Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the Panamanian leader.
   Specifically, Thurman recommended that tour lengths for U.S.
servicemen and women be shortened and that those without families
be given the shorter tours, thereby reducing the number of
dependents.
   ``The changes were made to reduce the number of families in
Panama by reducing the number of personnel authorized to bring
family members with them. This action was recommended as a force
protection measure to ensure the security and quality of life of
all U.S. military members and their families in Panama,'' said
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
   Last May, U.S. officials began evacuating military dependents.
As of July 1, some 6,300 Defense Department personnel had either
been sent home or relocated onto U.S. bases in Panama.
   But there are still roughly 11,000 American dependents in the
country.
   The United States has 10,000 soldiers permanently assigned to
Panama, 2,500 military personnel there on temporary duty, 7,700
military dependents, 2,700 U.S. civilian Pentagon employees and
3,300 civilian dependents.
   The 30-month tour for those service personnel accompanied by
families has been shortened to 24 months, while those without
dependents will now serve a 12-month tour instead of 24, the
statement said.
   Thurman reportedly recommended the change to heighten the sense
of military readiness among his troops in Panama, where the United
States has pressed for the removal of Noriega, who is wanted in the
United States on indictments charging drug trafficking.
   Williams said he did not know when the new rotations would
begin, but a Pentagon statement said the tour lengths of those
already stationed in Panama ``will be adjusted on a pro rata basis
by the services.''
   In a statement issued later in the day, the Pentagon said it
expected to have the number of service personnel with families
reduced to 300 to 500 level by mid-1990, but that several hundred
families should be able to leave within the next month.
   The statement said there is ``no accurate way'' to determine how
many dependents might be in the country if only 300 to 500 service
personnel accompanied by family members were allowed to be in
Panama.
   It added that the new policy only affects military dependents,
but that a plan is under review that would also apply to the
dependents of civilian employees of the Pentagon stationed there.

   The Soviet government broke its silence Thursday
on the rapid changes convulsing East Germany with praise for its
ally's leadership shake-up and its first steps toward Soviet-style
reforms.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said that
although it was not the Soviet Union's place to comment on another
country's internal affairs, it was clear East Germany was
undertaking a ``renewal of socialism.''
   ``They're improving the situation in the sense that they're
moving toward perestroika on their own terms,'' he told a news
briefing, referring to the reforms President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
began on coming to power in 1985.
   Millions of Soviets learned in TV, radio and newspaper reports
of the dramatic overhaul of East Germany's ruling Politburo and new
leader Egon Krenz's promises of democratic reforms.
   The official news agency Tass quickly reported that the East
German government had thrown open all borders and that its citizens
could travel or emigrate anywhere.
   Vyacheslav Mostovoy, a correspondent reporting on Soviet
television's widely watched nightly news program Vremya, said East
Germany's Central Committee had begun mapping political and
economic reforms in a ``program which the whole country awaits and
on which the future of the republic largely depends.''
   Mostovoy, reporting from East Germany, stressed the elevation of
reformers to the Politburo. He quoted Krenz as saying in a speech
that the East German communist party leadership had earlier taken a
negative approach to changes in the Soviet Union and other
socialist countries.
   Krenz's predecessor, Erich Honecker, had been cool to
Gorbachev's reforms and resisted implementing them in his own
country. But Krenz told Gorbachev in a telephone call last month
that ``there are important lessons to be learned from Soviet
perestroika in the German Democratic Republic.''
   During a visit to Moscow, Krenz discussed possible applications
in East Germany of Soviet-style reforms.
   ``We wholeheartedly support the revolutionary process of
perestroika in the Soviet Union,'' he told reporters, adding he
especially wanted to explore its aim of making socialism ``more
attractive.''
   In its reports on East German developments, Radio Moscow focused
on that government's plans for a party conference and Krenz's call
for more democracy.
   Tass issued at least four reports. One report said the changes
the Central Committee is discussing ``came from the street'' and
that the party must admit its mistakes or lose its right to govern.
   Tass ran excerpts of Krenz's 86-page speech Wednesday to the
Central Committee, highlighting his remarks on the former
government's hostility toward the Soviet reforms.
   It quoted Krenz's condemnation of the old Politburo's ``negative
wait-and-see attitude and partly dogmatic and haughty attitude to
processes taking place in the Soviet Union and other socialist
countries.''
   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia also gave readers
details of Krenz's speech and reported the continuing mass exodus
of East Germans.
   On Wednesday, Vremya showed Mostovoy standing against the
backdrop of an outdoor public protest in Berlin and describing the
``exceptionally important political events'' in East Germany this
week.
   ``The process of reform and renewal that started just a few
weeks ago is continuing with unusual quickness,'' Mostovoy said in
a report of about three minutes that came halfway through the
45-minute show.
   Mostovoy praised the East German press for ``covering events in
detail and objectively'' and noted that thousands of people left
the country in the past day as part of the continuing exodus to
West Germany.
   Pravda carried a brief report on East Germany, listing the new
composition of the Politburo and noting the government's appeals to
citizens to keep the country functioning normally.

<TEXT>
   In South Carolina, unlike Puerto Rico, much of
the death brought by Hurricane Hugo came at the peak of the storm's
impact, a U.S. government report concluded Thursday.
   The national Centers for Disease Control looked at 29 injury
deaths associated with Hurricane Hugo, as reported by officials in
25 South Carolina counties. Thirteen of those deaths, the CDC said,
occurred during the ``impact phase'' of the storm's assault on the
state Sept. 21-22.
   The pattern was different in Puerto Rico, where the storm struck
days earlier. There, only two of nine deaths occurred during the
storm's impact; most of the deaths were electrocutions among repair
workers after the storm.
   The CDC said, however, that in both Puerto Rico and South
Carolina, the historical hurricane pattern of death by drowning in
storm surges did not hold. The CDC reported just one storm-surge
drowning in South Carolina, a 60-year-old woman who died in her
mobile home.
   Five other people drowned while trying to bring boats inland at
Charleston.
   The other impact-phase deaths in South Carolina included four
people crushed in mobile homes, one person killed in the collapse
of a house and two killed by falling trees.
   Most of the 16 injury deaths after the storm involved nine
people who were killed in five separate house fires. The fires were
blamed on the use of candles during power outages.
   Four people were electrocuted during clean-up and repair work,
two people were killed by falling trees and one died in a chain-saw
mishap.
   With the South Carolina deaths in mind, the CDC on Thursday
recommended more efforts to educate the public in hurricane areas
about the hazards of candles, the need to evacuate mobile homes and
the hazards of boating during the approach of a killer storm.
   After the deaths in Puerto Rico, the CDC last month recommended
greater precautions for electrical workers repairing hurricane
damage.

<HEAD>Former FDA Official Says Food Labeling Bill Doesn't Go Far Enough</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former FDA official said Thursday current
proposals to revise food nutrition labeling requirements don't go
far enough and would omit labels on more than 60 percent of the
food Americans eat.
   Sanford A. Miller, former director of the Center for Food Safety
and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration, told a
food industry group the proposed legislation doesn't cover
restaurant food or meat and poultry.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
have introduced the ``Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of
1989,'' and hearings on the bill are scheduled to begin next week
in the Senate.
   ``I am most concerned because the bill simply does not go far
enough,'' said Miller, dean of the graduate school of Biomedical
Sciences at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San
Antonio.
   ``Essentially the bill ignores two-thirds of the foods we eat
regularly, many of which are high in fat and sodium, two of the
nutrients for which many people have concern,'' he told a luncheon
sponsored by the Chocolate Manufacturers Association.
   Metzenbaum, in an interview, defended the legislation, saying,
``Our bill deals with practically all the foods on your grocery
shelves, everything from misleading claims on cereal boxes to the
saturated fat content in potato chips.''
   ``It does not address labeling of meat and poultry but we hope
the agricultural committees will follow our legislative lead,'' he
added.
   Twenty-three groups, including the American Cancer Society and
the American Heart Association, have endorsed the proposed
legislation.
   One consumer group said the Chocolate Manufacturers wants to
derail or dilute a proposed requirement to include a detailed
breakdown of foods' fat content.
   ``The CMA doesn't want the disclosure of saturated fats,'' said
Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs for the Center for
Science in the Public Interest.
   ``We believe that there should be nutritional labeling on meats
and poultry as well as food under FDA jurisdiction but attempting
to acccomplish all that in a single congressional session would
cause the bill to collapse under its own weight,'' he said.
   ``A lot of the industry concerned are looking to try to make the
bill weaker,'' said Waxman, ``but we're going to fight to keep this
bill as a strong consumer information and protection bill.''
   The legislation would require that nutrition labeling on all
processed food under the FDA's jurisdiction list the serving size,
number of servings per container, total calories and a breakdown of
calories by total and saturated fat. Also required would be amounts
by servings of fats _ total, saturated and unsaturated _
cholesterol, sodium, complex carbohydrates, protein, dietary fiber
and other nutrients.
   Any health claims on labels would have to be sustantiated by a
consensus of scientific reasoning and use terms defined by the
secretary of health and human services.

   It's every kid's worst nightmare: a
spinach cook-off.
   The culinary countdown is part of the Crystal City Spinach
Festival, an annual event that draws thousands to this South Texas
town of about 8,500. They're welcomed by _ who else? _ Popeye.
   An 8-foot concrete statue of the spinach-chomping cartoon sailor
sits in front of City Hall, symbolizing Crystal City's love affair
with the dark green leafy stuff.
   ``We're expecting 50,000,'' said Bella Delgado, a spokeswoman
for the Crystal City Spinach Festival Association. ``They come from
all over the world. I don't know why, they just come.''
   This year's gala starts Friday and lasts through Sunday.
   Spinach fanatics from as far away as London have called to
inquire about the festival. Official guests include former San
Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros, U.S. Rep. Albert Bustamante of San
Antonio and state Rep. Ernestine Glossbrenner of Alice.
   The Spinach Festival also features sports contests, live music,
a carnival, parade, chili cook-off, Miss Spinach pageant and the
ever popular spinach cook-off.
   To cap the celebration, Festival-goers will see a real-life
Popeye leap from a plane with a group of skydivers during the
festival.
   Chefs put forward their best recipes to make such taste treats
as spinach casserole, spinach dip, spinach salad and spinach quiche.
   What about the kids in this spinach-loving town? Well, they come
around, according to Ms. Delgado, who didn't like spinach herself
until age 16.
   ``I didn't like spinach at first, but now I do,'' she said. ``I
had to try it.''

   State Trooper Robby Anger's Lamaze class
in natural childbirth techniques emphasizes relaxation. But try
telling that to a cow.
   Anger and fellow Trooper Mark O'Donnell got a call from a
motorist Thursday telling them a Holstein cow was giving birth on
the shoulder of Route 36 in Dansville, about 45 miles south of
Rochester.
   ``The mother was very protective when we got there _ we didn't
know it was two of them,'' O'Donnell said. ``Then we could see two
legs and the head coming out.''
   Troopers are routinely trained to help humans give birth, but
neither Anger nor O'Donnell had ever helped anything give birth,
they said.
   ``Robby's wife is pregnant _ he's going to Lamaze classes, so he
stayed with the mother to help and I ran up to the nearest farm to
wake somebody up,'' O'Donnell said. ``We figured it was good
practice for him.''
   The mother, it turned out, didn't need much coaching and
wouldn't let the troopers near her. After she cleaned up her newly
born calf, O'Donnell set up a roadblock so oncoming cars wouldn't
hit it.
   Both mother and newborn are reportedly doing fine, O'Donnell
said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday signed a bill
providing $67 billion for veterans, housing, environment, space and
other programs for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Bush said in a statement that the measure included a $500
million increase, to $11.4 billion, in Veterans Administration
medical care.
   ``Those men and women who have served in the military can expect
to receive the benefits they deserve,'' Bush said, noting that the
nation is about to celebrate Veterans Day.
   The bill provides $12.4 billion for NASA, $1.7 billion more than
last year's level. Of the total, $1.8 billion would go to
development of the planned space station, $250 million less than
the Bush administration sought.
   It makes available $5.6 billion for the Environmental Protection
Agency, a $400 million boost over 1989. The Superfund hazardous
waste cleanup program would get $1.5 billion and anti-pollution
efforts $817 million.
   Veterans' medical care would receive $11.4 billion, $551 million
more than last year. Housing programs would be bolstered by $2.3
billion over 1989 levels, to $15.1 billion.
   The legislation also increases, to $124,874, the size of home
mortgages available from the Federal Housing Administration in many
communities with high housing prices.

   The automobile industry can meet gasoline
mileage standards proposed for the mid-1990s and beyond, but doing
so would disrupt plans to improve vehicle performance and size, the
Department of Energy says.
   In a letter to Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nevada, the department said
the domestic new car fleet could meet or exceed a 32.8 miles per
gallon average by 1995 and the 38.2 mpg average by 2001. Those are
the standards Bryan seeks in a bill that would update federal
fuel-economy requirements.
   ``This certainly puts the gloom and doom comments of the
industry into perspective,'' Bryan, chairman of the consumer
subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation, said Thursday. ``The automobile industry may have
cried wolf one too many times.''
   Tim McCarthy, federal liaison director for the Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Association, said he had not seen the Energy
Department letter. Told of its contents, he said it appeared to
support the industry's contention that implementing the Bryan
standards would require a major overhaul of production plans for
the next decade.
   ``The problem with the Bryan approach is when you're trying to
produce a full line of vehicles that meet various industry and
family needs, it becomes difficult if not impossible'' to achieve
his standards, McCarthy said. ``If you want to produce 10 million
tiny cars a year, they do have a niche in the market but it's not a
huge niche.''
   Bryan's bill would require each manufacturer to improve its
average fuel economy by at least 20 percent beginning with the 1995
model and 40 percent by the year 2001.
   In a Sept. 6 letter to the Energy Department, Bryan posed a
series of questions about the industry's ability to comply.
Industry spokesmen contend the proposed standards are unrealistic.
   In its response, signed by Deputy Undersecretary Linda G.
Stuntz, the department said domestic vehicle manufacturers could
achieve an average of 32 to 33 mpg for new passenger cars by 1995
``if they modified product plans to make maximum use of available
technology and return to 1987 levels of vehicle size, performance
and luxury.''
   ``While it is theoretically feasible, we do not believe it is
practical to return to the earlier (1987) levels of performance and
size by 1995,'' the department's letter said.
   ``To do so would greatly disrupt current product plans and
lessen manufacturers' ability to apply the available fuel economy
technology and, at the same time, achieve emissions, safety and
possibly alternative fuels goals,'' the letter said.

   Police reported more bombing attempts
Thursday against Parliament members who elected Rene Mouawad as
Lebanon's new president, and Mouawad pursued talks on forming a
Cabinet of national reconciliation.
   Sources among Western diplomats said Thursday the diplomats will
shun Gen. Michel Aoun, head of the Christian Cabinet for the past
13 months, who has refused to recognize the election of the
president election last weekend.
   ``There has been a decision to boycott Aoun,'' said one
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   French Ambassador Rene Ala was the last diplomat to visit Aoun
on Sunday. Aoun dismissed as unconstitutional Parliament's election
in north Lebanon that day and refused to leave the presidential
palace in suburban Baabda to allow Mouawad, a Maronite Christian,
to settle in there.
   Police reported Thursday that a 66-pound bomb was defused
minutes before it was set to explode late Wednesday outside the
apartment of Christian deputy Michel Sassine in east Beirut's
Ashrafiyeh neighborhood.
   A police spokesman said a small bomb did explode Tuesday under
the car of Christian deputy Nasri Maalouf in east Beirut's Hazmiyeh
district and another went off overnight under the car of Druse
deputy Toufik Assaf in west Beirut.
   The attacks caused damage but no casualties, said the spokesman,
who cannot be identified under standing regulations.
   At least six bombs have targeted deputies in Beirut since Nov.
3. Five of them exploded. No one claimed responsibility and each
side blamed the other.
   Mouawad's election was under terms of a peace plan that would
cede more political power to the Moslem majority and end Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war. Aoun complained that the plan lacked a
timetable for total withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops here. He
fought the Syrian forces for six months until an Arab
League-sponsored cease-fire in September.
   The Syrians are in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.
   Mouawad, 64, set up headquarters at the prime minister's office
in Syrian-policed west Beirut, becoming the first Christian
president to operate from the city's Moslem sector in 31 years.
   Mouawad met with Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite
Moslem, and then with Salim Hoss who headed the predominantly
Moslem Cabinet before the presidential election.
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, supports Mouawad and submitted his
Cabinet's resignation Monday to facilitate formation of a new
government.
   Husseni later told reporters that ``consultations are
continuing. The objective is the formation of a national
reconciliation government which, most probably, will be an expanded
one.''
   Mouawad also met with Moslem and Christian deputies and with
former ministers.
   Syrian soldiers ringed the area to protect the new president,
causing a traffic jam.
   Mouawad's meetings came a day after a car bomb explosion near
his intended residence killed four people and wounded 19.

   Secretary Jack Kemp's proposals for reforming
the scandal-ridden Department of Housing and Urban Development won
passage in a House subcommittee Thursday with bipartisan support.
   The housing subcommittee of the House Banking Committee approved
a bill including most of the elements of Kemp's reform package, and
both Democrats and Republicans said the full committee may send the
measure to the House floor next week.
   ``The HUD reform package approved today will change
significantly the way the department operates,'' said Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y. ``The measure will eliminate much of the
possibility of fraud and abuse at the department.''
   Schumer, who sat with another subcommittee that investigated the
billion-dollar scandals involving mismanagement, influence-peddling
and fraud at HUD, said the reform package would bring ``openness
and disclosure'' to the department's grant-selection process.
   Among the Kemp proposals included in the approved package were a
requirement that consultants on HUD projects be registered, subject
to criminal penalties; establishment of a department chief
financial officer and comptroller for the Federal Housing
Administration; limits on FHA mortgages for second residences and a
requirement that HUD waivers of regulations be disclosed.
   The panel added to Kemp's initiatives a requirement that HUD
provide documentation in support of all funding decisions, and a
requirement that HUD consider the value of low-income tax credits
received by developers on projects for which they may also benefit
from other HUD subsidies.

   The Navy conceded Thursday that its employees
violated regulations in accepting free training from IBM Corp.
   A House subcommittee, which has been investigating mismanagement
of the Navy's automated data processing service, said at least 128
Navy officials were improperly trained by IBM in San Jose, Calif.,
from 1985 to 1987.
   The disclosure came just one day after the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, and the Defense
Department testified that the Navy showed partiality toward IBM in
awarding millions of dollars of computer contracts.
   ``It's as if all the laws and regulations are being evaded, and
that we have very serious problems in terms of having open and fair
competition in government procurement,'' Rep. John Conyers, Jr.,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Government Affairs subcommittee on
legislation and national security, said Thursday.
   ``It is my opinion that acceptance of the IBM vendor training
was not in accordance with the controlling regulations,'' Roger T.
McNamara, assistant general counsel on ethics at the Navy, told the
House subcommittee.
   ``Consequently, government travel funds should not have been
authorized in the first instance for such a purpose. However, they
were,'' he said.
   Specifically, he said IBM's selection of employees to attend the
training program violated Defense Department and Navy rules on
accepting free vendor training.
   The training represented an impermissible gratuity, McNamara
said.
   Alvin F. Easter, program manager for IBM's Data Processing
Management Institute, defended its program, saying none of the
company's ``executive education offerings ... were devised for the
Navy _ or any other particular customer or set of customers.''
   Easter said federal employees, including the Navy, made up ``but
a small fraction of the attendees at these San Jose Executive
Education classes during the entire period being considered by the
committee.''
   The House subcommittee, GAO and Defense Department inquiries
were prompted by a November 1988 letter from six IBM competitors in
which they said they had been frozen out of much of the Navy's
multibillion-dollar computer market.
   The companies complained to then-Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci that Navy officials had tailored the bid specifications so
that only IBM could win although many of the companies offer
``clones'' or duplicates of IBM systems at lower prices.
   The five-page letter was signed by executives of the Amdahl
Corp.; Memorex Telex Corp.; PacifiCorp Capital Inc.; VION Corp.;
NCR Compten; and Storage Technology Corp.

   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder's margin over
Republican Marshall Coleman in the governor's race widened slightly
Thursday as more counties certified results and errors in
unofficial tallies were corrected.
   Changes in vote totals from six jurisdictions boosted Wilder's
total by just under 300 votes, while cutting slightly less than 800
from Coleman's total. Late Thursday, the unofficial statewide total
stood at 896,553 for Wilder to 889,971 for Coleman _ a margin of
6,582 votes for the Democrat.
   Many Virginia jurisdictions continued retabulating the vote
Thursday in preparation for certifying the returns to the state
government.
   Availability of official tabulations made the biggest difference
in Newport News, where Wilder picked up 274 votes and Coleman lost
119. That official total boosted Wilder's statewide margin by 393
votes.
   Certified vote totals in Henry County and in Chesapeake and
Norfolk changed each candidates' tallies by a small number of votes.
   The biggest change in unofficial tallies was in Fairfax County.
   The registar's office on Thursday said the county's unofficial
totals were Wilder 127,184 and Coleman 99,126. These figures were
the same as AP reported late Tuesday after the election.
   On Wednesday, the AP had obtained totals from the registrar's
office giving Wilder 127,197 and Coleman 99,835 _ which would have
raised Coleman's statewide total. The registrar on Thursday said
the Tuesday night figures were the correct, unofficial totals.
   Official Fairfax totals will not be available until Friday.
   Correcting a data entry error by the AP in Prince William
County's totals boosted Wilder's tally by 34 votes.
   Official certification of the statewide vote is scheduled Nov.
27.

<TEXT>
   A state legislator's 19-year-old son was
charged Thursday with shooting a hunting arrow into his mother's
heart, killing her, during a predawn dispute at the family
farmhouse.
   A criminal complaint filed in Dodge County Circuit Court charged
Chad E. Goetsch with first-degree intentional homicide in the death
early Wednesday of his mother, Carolyn Goetsch, 51.
   Goetsch told authorities he shot his mother accidentally while
playing with a hunting bow at the farmhouse, according to the
complaint.
   But Goetsch's father, state Rep. Robert R. Goetsch, said in the
complaint that his son shot his wife, then pointed an arrow at him.
   ``My son was going to kill me,'' the lawmaker said in the
complaint. He said he grabbed the arrowhead and broke it off,
cutting his hand.
   Robert Goetsch said he and his son fought, passing through a
hall and several rooms. At one point, the legislator's 14-year-old
daughter, Shana, grabbed a knife to protect herself, authorities
said.
   Shana Goetsch called authorities, who arrested Chad Goetsch at
the home outside Juneau, a town of about 2,000 people about 50
miles southwest of Milwaukee.
   Mrs. Goetsch was pronounced dead at the scene. Robert Goetsch
was treated at a hospital for cuts on his hands and face, and
released. No charges were filed in connection with his injuries.
   If convicted of homicide, Chad Goetsch faces a mandatory
sentence of life in prison.
   Circuit Judge Daniel W. Klossner set bail at $200,000 cash, and
ordered the young man to undergo psychiatric evaluation at Mendota
Mental Health Institute in Madison. A public defender was appointed
to represent him.
   Robert Goetsch did not attend Thursday's hearing.
   Chad Goetsch is a freshman at Marquette University in Milwaukee
and does not live at home. He is Mrs. Goetsch's biological son, and
was adopted by Robert Goetsch when the couple married 15 years ago,
relatives have said.
   Shana told authorities that she had heard her brother threaten
her parents' lives in the past, the complaint said.
   During a domestic dispute at the Goetsch home in November 1987,
authorities said they found a note in Chad Goetsch's room that
said, ``Nothing would please me more than your death ...,'' the
complaint said. The letter was signed with Chad's initials.
   In a fight in September 1988, Chad Goetsch punched his mother in
the eye and choked his father, the complaint said.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Pittston Co. and United
Mine Workers met jointly for the first time Thursday with the
government ``supermediator'' named to resolve the bitter and often
violent 7-month-old strike.
   No significant progress was reported in a session said to be
largely dedicated to setting the groundrules for intensive
negotiations set to begin Monday.
   ``I'm absolutely convinced that both sides want a contract,''
mediator W.J. Usery said after the session. ``We need the jobs. We
need people back to work and we need paychecks.''
   Usery, a former labor secretary and veteran mediator, spent 75
minutes in a joint meeting with the two sides and then had several,
shorter talks with company and union representatives in separate
rooms. Both sides agreed to negotiate throughout next week and also
to refuse to discuss the substance of those talks with the press,
Usery said.
   The walkout began in April and has kept 1,700 miners in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky of the job. Their picketing
has been marred by sporadic violence and the union has been heavily
fined for defying court orders restricting its demonstrations.
   The biggest issue in the dispute is over Pittston's payments of
health and retirement benefits, a fight whose outcome could have
far-reaching effects in the coal industry.
   The session was the first at which UMW President Richard Trumka
and Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas sat face-to-face with their
respective negotiating teams as well as the first joint meeting
with Usery, who was named as mediator two weeks ago by Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   Trumka and Douglas both had praise for Usery after the meeting
but no substantive progress to report.
   ``We weren't dealing with substance,'' Trumka said. ``We're just
going over ground rules.''
   Douglas said he was willing to do ``whatever I can do to help
with the process.''
   Douglas participated in the entire joint session but left a
short time later, leaving behind the rest of the Pittston team.
``I've got to get back,'' he said when leaving, presumably
referring to Pittston's headquarters in Greenwich, Conn.
   Usery said he did not want Trumka and Douglas at the talks next
week unless a settlement appeared within reach.
   As for Usery, Douglas said he was ``very impressed'' with the
mediator and Trumka added: ``If anyone can get this job done I
think Bill Usery can.''

   West German politicians praised
communist East Germany's decision Thursday to open its borders and
said the Berlin Wall had lost its purpose.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, on a state visit to Poland, said he
wanted to meet soon with Egon Krenz, who became the East German
leader last month. ``We will be in contact with the East German
leadership shortly after my return,'' he said.
   Of the open borders, Kohl said only, ``It is too soon to tell
what will develop out of the decision.'' Other leaders were more
enthusiastic.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, leader of the opposition Social Democrats,
said it ``means that after 28 years, the Berlin Wall has lost its
function.''
   Friedrich Bohl, a government leader in Parliament, said East
Germany should ``start tearing down the Berlin Wall tomorrow.''
   Officials in East Berlin have said the decision to allow freer
travel did not mean the wall had lost its purpose.
   Guenter Schabowski of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo
told reporters Thursday it still had value as the demarcation line
between the two military alliances, the Warsaw Pact and NATO.
   Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, general secretary of the West
Germany's Free Democratic Party, called the opening of borders ``an
historic hour for the German people.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday refused to bar the
Navy from starting construction on a submarine acoustical testing
facility in a prime fishing and recreation area in southeastern
Alaska.
   U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Green denied a motion for a
preliminary injunction by the Tongass Conservation Society and six
other organizations to stop the Navy's planned Southeast Alaska
Acoustic Measurement Facility, known as SEAFAC, in Ketchikan
Gateway Borough.
   The Navy plans to build measurement sites in the center of
western Behm Canal, northwest of Back Island and shore facilities
on Back Island.
   The Navy anticipates tests would be under way for up to 75 days
a year and during these periods access to some areas of Behm Canal
would be restricted or prohibited.
   The organizations argued that the project will threaten the
environment of the Behm Canal area and threaten sport and
commercial fishing and recreational activities in the area.
   They said the Navy failed to meet the requirements of the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires an
assessment of the project's impact.
   Green ruled that the Navy fulfilled the mandate of NEPA by
giving ``serious consideration'' to the socioeconomic impacts of
SEAFAC and that national security interests would be compromised by
issuing a preliminary injunction.
   The judge noted that the Navy has taken a number of steps,
including scheduling testing for times that avoid major fishing
events. The Navy also has agreed to notify the community in advance
of testing dates to allow people to plan around the restrictions.
   The Navy is having increasing difficulty monitoring noise levels
of submarines at the two existing facilities serving the Pacific
fleet _ Carr Inlet in Washington and Santa Cruz Island in
California.
   The Navy says it cannot adequately monitor the Trident class of
nuclear subs because of increasing surrounding noise levels in the
areas and because the subs are quieter than earlier models.

   Venezuela and Guyana have moved closer
to solving a 157-year-old territorial dispute following a meeting
between presidents of the neighboring South American nations, state
radio said Thursday.
   Guyana's Desmond Hoyte and Venezuela's Carlos Andres Perez
agreed Wednesday in Caracas to appoint a mediator to settle the
dispute that involves 60 percent of Guyana's land, including all of
its mineral-rich western region.
   Since 1832, 11 years after gaining independence from Spain,
Venezuela has laid claims to the territory.
   Venezuela said the British, who first made claims on the land
that became Guyana in the late 16th century, had taken territory
that had belonged to the Spanish Empire for decades. The Dutch, who
had a competing claim in the region, ceded the territory to Britain
in 1814.
   Tense relations attributed to the land claim did not subside
with Guyana's independence from Britain in 1966, and only began to
improve when Hoyte came to power in 1985.
   Hoyte and Perez chose Alister McIntyre, vice chancellor of the
University of the West Indies, as mediator.
   Before returning home later this week, Hoyte was expected to ask
Venezuela to resume shipments of oil on credit to Guyana. Venezuela
suspended shipments earlier this year, citing Guyana's unpaid $25
million bill.

   The State Department barred the leader of the
Contra rebels from holding a news conference on Thursday, citing
legal constraints on use of federal funds that bought his ticket to
Washington.
   Israel Galeano, who goes by the nom de guerre Commander
Franklin, had scheduled an afternoon press conference to discuss
the rebels' position on elections in Nicaragua and their decision
to fight back against attack by the ruling Sandinistas, said Greg
Mueller, a conservative activist who set up the news conference.
   But Franklin was told by a lawyer at the State Department there
that he could not go to the news conference, participants said.
   The reason given was that his trip was being paid for by
taxpayer funds which cannot be used to influence public opinion,
according to Franklin and to State Department officials who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   But Mueller accused U.S. officials of trying to ``muzzle''
Franklin out of fear he might say something to jeopardize talks
between Contra representatives and the Sandinistas that began
Thursday at the United Nations.
   A State Department official said the caution on use of U.S.
funds stems from revelations in the Iran-Contra affair that changed
the climate for trotting out the U.S.-backed Contras to present
their points of view.
   ``Iran-Contra changed the entire approach to these kinds of
activities,'' the official said.
   A department lawyer cited the law as prohibiting use of taxpayer
funds to influence public opinion, said the official.
   Dave Hirschmann, research director for the conservative Council
on Inter-American Security, said his non-profit lobbying
organization had offered to pay for Franklin's ticket, but that the
administration blocked that offer.
   Some 25 reporters who showed up at the news conference were
informed by an associate of Franklin that he could not come because
he had to take a call from those involved in the talks at the
United Nations in New York, said Mueller.
   That was not the case, Franklin said through Hirschmann.
   ``The State Department has a history of constantly trying to gag
them,'' Mueller said. He said Franklin had planned to release a
letter, which he delivered to vice President Dan Quayle later. The
letter stated the Contras throught it ``would be foolish'' to lay
down their arms before the scheduled Nicaraguan elections next Feb.
25 because they need to defend themselves against attack by the
leftist Sandinistas.
   In New York, at the first direct talks between the contras and
Sandinistsa in more than a year, the Sandinistas said they would
meet Contra demands for a truce and amnesty if the rebels agree to
begin disbanding by the end of the month.

   East Germany opened the Berlin Wall and its other
borders Thursday, and its cheering citizens crossed freely to the
West for the first time since 1961.
   Late Thursday, exultant East Germans began passing through
Berlin Wall checkpoints and others entered West Germany at other
border crossings. Jubilant people pranced and danced atop the
Berlin Wall, a sight unthinkable only hours earlier.
   Hundreds were seen on the Friedrichstrasse subway to West
Berlin, and East Germans also were allowed for the first time at
Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Friedrichstrasse crossing run by the
Allied military.
   Many hugged and kissed total strangers, while cars packed with
East Germans and others paraded down the streets of West Berlin in
a carnival-like atmosphere.
   ``It's crazy! It's crazy!'' yelled one young man as he sat in
the back seat of a car with his parents after a brief trip through
the once-impenetrable Berlin Wall.
   His parents said they just wanted to see the West _ and then
drive back. They declined to give their names.
   ``We heard it on TV, we just decided to go over and have a
look,'' said the young man's father. ``We want to show our son a
little bit of Kurfuerstendamm.''
   The Kurfuerstendamm is one of Europe's most elegant shopping
strips. For decades, East Germans locked up behind the
now-crumbling Iron Curtain could only dream of seeing it.
   All apparently were arriving without visas, although visas
technically were necessary under regulations announced earlier in
the day. A spokesman for the West German border police in
Braunschweig said the East Germans had been allowed over the border
there without visas.
   About 100 East Berliners gathered at the Brandenburg Gate, just
inside the wall, and chanted: ``Open the gate! Open the gate!''
   With decades of fortified frontiers apparently at an end, the
wall that symbolized East-West division for decades may become a
mere monument to the Cold War.
   Since it appeared during an August night 28 years ago and East
Germany's borders were sealed, 191 people are known to have died
while fleeing to the West.
   Egon Krenz, East Germany's new leader, also advocated a law
Thursday that would ensuring free and democratic elections in his
communist nation, which has been disrupted by pro-reform
demonstrations and weakened by mass flight to the West.
   The Central Committee scheduled a Communist Party conference for
Dec. 15-17. Party conferences are forums for making major changes
in policy and the last one was held in 1956.
   More than 200,000 East Germans, nearly 1{ percent of the
population, have left so far this year _ 50,000 since Saturday
alone. Most are young, skilled workers vital to the economy.
   Hundreds of thousands of people who stayed home have filled the
streets to demand democratic reforms and an end to 40 years of
rigid one-party rule.
   As the news spread the number of East Germans heading for
Bavaria through Czechoslovakia rose dramatically. The official East
German news agency ADN reported up to 4,000 per hour entering
Czechoslovakia at the Schoenberg crossing, 10 times the number of
people entering Bavaria a few hours earlier.
   Guenter Schabowski, a member of the ruling Politburo, said the
borders were being opened until a law was passed to allow East
Germans greater freedom of travel.
   Schabowski did not say when the law would be passed. He also
said East Germany was not yet ready to remove all its barriers.
   The Central Committee decision means all East Germans ``can
travel over all East German border checkpoints,'' including through
the Berlin Wall, Schabowski told reporters.
   He said those seeking to emigrate could go to West Germany
directly without having to pass through a third country. East
Germans have fled through Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   Anyone merely wanting to visit the West would need a visa,
Schabowski said, but they should be issued quickly. He did not
mention limits on time that could be spent abroad.
   Offices that issue travel visas had closed for the night by the
time Schabowki made the historic announcement, so no further
information was available.
   East Germans reacted with astonishment and jubilation.
   ``Is it really true?'' asked Mario Schmidt, 18.
   ``Now I no longer feel locked in here,'' said Uwe Landgraf, 28,
who hoped to travel to Paris.
   ``I think that even some of those who left recently will come
back now,'' said a 25-year-old electrician who identified himself
only as Thomas.
   Erich Honecker, the 77-year-old leader Krenz replaced last
month, supervised the building of the wall before he became
Communist Party chief. Every U.S. president since John F. Kennedy
has urged that it be torn down.
   President Bush called Thursday's announcement a ``dynamic
development ... clearly a big development in terms of human
rights.''
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said the
decision amounts to ``the symbolic destruction of the Berlin
Wall,'' and urged East Germany to ``take the final step and tear
that wall down.''
   ``The wall is the most tangible symbol of the failure of
communism,'' he said.
   West German leaders hailed the decision. Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
on an official visit to Poland, said: ``We will be in contact with
the East German leadership shortly after my return and I would like
to meet very soon with Mr. Krenz.''
   Fifteen prominent Communist intellectuals and officials in East
Berlin wrote to the Central Committee suggesting the wall be torn
down.
   ``It is also imaginable, even in the foreseeable future, that
the wall will become a relic of the past'' if an agreement is
signed with West Germany that would prevent ``damage to the East
German economy,'' they said. The letter was published Thursday in
the Berliner Zeitung, a party newspaper.
   As protest and flight gathered momentum this week, the
leadership took increasingly desperate steps in an attempt to turn
the tide.
   On Wednesday, Krenz purged the old guard from the party
Politburo and slimmed it down from 21 members to 11.
   An ADN dispatch said the party conference next month would
consider personnel changes in the 163-member Central Committee.
   Krenz, 52, touched on multiparty elections in a speech to the
Central Committee that official newspapers published Thursday. He
recommended a ``new election law that ensures free, democratic
general elections with a secret ballot'' and proposed ``public
supervision in every stage of the balloting.''
   He did not say whether he wanted a true multiparty system in
East Germany, but has said previously the supremacy of the
Communist Party is not open to debate. Officials define the current
election system, which guarantees the Communists virtually
unanimous approval, as democratic.
   The new leader also promised laws on freedom of assembly,
association and the press. He gave no details, but said independent
groups might have a role in politics.
   East Germany's pro-democracy opposition has made free elections
its main demand. Plans have been reported to legalize New Forum,
the largest group.

<TEXT>
   A federal jury on Thursday convicted a
margarine heiress and a Colombian co-defendant of helping her
unemployed boyfriend run a cocaine ring out of her mansion.
   Sandra Filbert Amos, the 35-year-old granddaughter of the
founder of Mrs. Filbert's Margarine, and Guillermo Moran, a
32-year-old Colombian living in New York City, face a maximum
sentence of life in prison.
   U.S. Attorney Breckenridge Willcox said prosecutors would
probably recommend at least 10 years in prison without parole for
each of the defendants. U.S. District Judge Joseph Howard set
sentencing for Feb. 14.
   Amos and Moran were each found guilty of two counts of
distribution of cocaine and one count of conspiracy to distribute
more than five kilograms of cocaine.
   Prosecutors said Amos helped Jeremia Dennis Case, her unemployed
boyfriend, set up the drug ring at her Easton mansion on Maryland's
Eastern Shore because she wanted to overcome his feeling that the
disparity in their incomes hurt their relationship.
   Case has pleaded guilty to drug charges, and is awaiting
sentencing.
   Defense attorney Russell White had argued that Amos was guilty
only of possession. He said Case distributed cocaine, while Amos

   Amos' $750,000 five-acre estate, including the mansion, has been

   Willcox said, ``There's sort of a bigger message here. Even
relatively uninvolved participants in a major conspiracy, people
who don't actually lug the cocaine around, even if they are knowing
participants, they are going to be convicted and serve as much time
as the major participants.''

   Thousands of .22-caliber semiautomatic pistols
called Scorpions, which may switch without warning to an automatic
function, are being recalled by the manufacturer under an agreement
reached with federal authorities, the government announced Thursday.
   ``A flawed part used in the manufacture of the Scorpion .22
semiautomatic pistol may cause the gun to malfunction, including
turning the semiautomatic into an automatic,'' Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms Director Stephen E. Higgins said in a
statement.
   In a semiautomatic weapon, a separate pull of the trigger is
required for each shot. In an automatic weapon, one pull of the
trigger can dispatch numerous shots. Congress in 1986 banned sales
of automatic weapons made on or after May 15, 1986, to all
purchasers the armed services and law enforcement agencies.
   The Scorpion is manufactured by Intratec, U.S.A., a Miami-based
firearms firm, according to ATF spokesman Jack Killorin.
   The company says it has sold about 20,000 of the guns and has an
additional 27,000 in a warehouse. The ATF will supervise the recall
and repair to make sure the guns are working properly before they
are allowed back on the market, ATF spokeswoman Dot Koester said.
   The bureau became aware of the problem several weeks ago, when
consumers began to complain, Koester said, adding that she did not
believe the malfunction had caused any injuries.
   ``A guy takes it out into the backyard to shoot a can and all of
a sudden his garage door falls apart,'' she said, giving an example
of the type of complaint he ATF received on the gun which generally
sells for about $200.
   After the complaints started coming in, the ATF ``sent some of
our agents out to buy them off the shelves to test them, and we
found the same thing,'' Koester said. ``Some of them may be all
right, but nobody knows for sure.''
   ``ATF has obtained an agreement from Intratec to recall the
Scorpions and to repair them,'' the bureau said in a statement.
Dealers and owners were advised to contact the manufacturer
concerning the recall.
   The malfunction in the gun stems from ``not using enough heat
when they tempered one part of the firearm,'' Koester said.
``According to our firearms technology people, this can be easily
remedied.''
   Intratec had given blueprints of the gun to ATF before it began
producing them in April 1988, she said, adding that such an action
went beyond government regulations and was not required.
   ``Unfortunately their blueprint did not take into account this
flaw of the heat,'' she said.
   Negotiations with the firm that resulted in the recall took two
days, Wednesday and Thursday, she said.
   Asked if the gun's occasional automatic firepower might make it
attractive to criminals who would try to buy it, Koester said, ``We
hope not.
   ``The gun really is a danger because it does malfunction,'' she
said. ``It's not dependable that it will shift into automatic. It
really is a broken gun, so it would be really stupid of them to do
that.''
   The same company manufactures the Tech 9, another semiautomatic
pistol that is equipped with a threaded barrel for silencers.
``That's the one the Jamaican posses, for example, like.''
   The company is located at 12405 130th Street, Miami.

   An Austrian paleontologist and
anthropologist said Thursday that his studies confirmed a skull
long assumed to belong to composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was
authentic.
   Gottfried Tichy, a professor at Salzburg University, said that
in 3{ years of study he found no indications the skull was not
Mozart.
   The skull has been kept in the Mozarteum School of Music in
Salzburg since early this century and was assumed to be that of the
composer.
   Tichy said he carefully examined not only the skull but
contemporary portraits of Mozart, historical accounts of his life,
medical reports and correspondence.
   Tichy told The Associated Press he came up with many pieces of
evidence and found ``no excluding reasons for it not to be''
Mozart's skull.
   He said the skull belonged to a man aged 30 to 40 and had
specific characteristics seen in portraits of Mozart. Tichy said it
also showed signs of a hemorrhage that could have explained
headaches Mozart reportedly complained of in his later letters.
   Mozart died at age 35 in 1791.

   There were wild scenes at Checkpoint Charlie, the
most famous crossing in the infamous Berlin Wall, when hundreds of
East Germans arrived Thursday night and tried to get through.
   Minutes after West German television said it had heard East
Germans were allowed to cross at Checkpoint Charlie, about 300 East
Berliners arrived carrying only their identity papers.
   Watched by cheering West Berliners, waving from 50 yards away,
the East Germans tried to persuade their border police to let them
through.
   ``I just want to go over and have a good time,'' one man said.
``We've got to get back to work tomorrow.''
   ``Let us have a beer over there,'' a woman said. ``We'll come
back.''
   ``We're coming right away!'' the East Germans shouted to West
Berliners on the other side.
   Suddenly, the border guards relented and hundreds of people ran
through toward the customs hall, waved on by East German officials.
   At the last barrier, the crowd encountered locked doors. Guards
urged everyone to be patient and distributed cards to be filled out.
   ``Just so we know who went through,'' one guard explained.
   ``This is a historic day!'' a man yelled. ``We're going to be
able to tell our children about this!''
   Then came disappointment. Border guards said no one could go
through without a visa stamp from East Berlin police, which they
could get only when police stations re-opened Friday morning.
   ``This is kindergarten,'' one youth grumbled.
   Eventually, the crowd was persuaded to turn back, but
34-year-old Angelika Wachs slipped through the door when it was
opened to let an Associated Press correspondent through.
   ``Ja-a-a-a,'' she whispered gleefully, then came tense seconds
as the East German guard checked her newly issued passport, which
contained a visa allowing her to visit West Germany beginning next
week.
   When she got past the controls and saw the screaming, cheering
West Berliners gathered to welcome any arrivals from the East, she
cried: ``This is unbelievable! I can't believe it!''
   She raced off to find a ride to a friend's house in the West
Berlin district of Charlottenburg.
   Later, hundreds more East Germans arrived at Checkpoint Charlie
and, finally, they too were let through. The flood of new arrivals
continued into the night, a historic night.

   A roadside bomb exploded and wounded two
soldiers as an Israeli army motorized patrol passed near a village
in southern Lebanon, the military command said.
   In a separate incident, a Soviet-made Katyusha rocket fired from
Lebanon landed in northern Israel, and others hit just north of the
border, the army said.
   Israel radio said a Lebanese man was slightly wounded from a
rocket blast in south Lebanon. No injuries were reported in Israel.
   The bombing occurred west of Kaukabe, the army said, about eight
miles north of Israel's border and inside its self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon.
   The army did not say who was responsible for Thursday's attacks,
which coincided with a Palestinian general strike in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip to mark the start of the 23rd month of an
uprising against Israeli rule.
   Israel established the 6- to 10-mile security zone in 1985 after
ending a three-year occupation of Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   Operators of a government-owned nuclear
production plant said Thursday that area residents were exposed to
virtually no tritium as a result of an accidental release of the
radioactive gas.
   Richard Neff, manager of environment, safety and health at the
Mound Nuclear Production Plant, said off-site air samples showed a
slight increase over normal levels of tritium, which is radioactive
hydrogen.
   But the maximum dose to each of the 2,400 residents under the
radioactive cloud from Wednesday's release was 0.00012 millirems,
he said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's standard of
safe dosage is 25 millirems a year.
   ``You're getting down to a range where it is essentially
nothing,'' said Neff, adding that such levels are difficult to
measure. ``The chance of a person getting cancer from this is
roughly equivalent to smoking 14 cigarettes.''
   Neff said that of the 52 workers evacuated from the building,
six had shown low levels of radiation in their systems. But he said
further testing revealed that those levels may have been the result
of the workers' regular handling of tritium.
   ``We don't have any concentrations greater than what we would
expect from normal operations,'' he said. ``We don't see any
workers who we feel have any significant exposure from this event.''
   Jim Morley, Dayton-area manager for the U.S. Department of
Energy, said DOE will investigate the incident.
   The radioactive gas was released into the air and fell over a
three-mile area northwest of the plant, extending over a section of
downtown Miamisburg and the Great Miami River.
   The plant enriches tritium gas, which is used in combination
with plutonium to act as a trigger for nuclear weapons. A total of
3.7 grams of tritium was released through an exhaust vent, about 10
times what the plant normally releases in a year.
   The release occurred when a quartz window in a bell jar
containing tritium shattered during a laser-drilling operation.
   About 2,200 workers are employed at the Mound Plant, which is
operated for the Energy Department by EG&amp;G Mound Applied
Technologies.

<HEAD>Major Case Squad That Found Four Bodies Disbands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sheriff Thursday disbanded a squad
of about 20 officers from nine counties brought together for a
murder investigation that turned up four bodies buried in barns.
   Livingston County Sheriff Leland O'Dell said the investigation
would continue with help from the Missouri State Highway Patrol,
but that other counties could not afford to continue providing
help. The North Central Missouri Major Case Squad, activated Oct.
13, worked 3,237 hours and checked 367 leads, he said.
   Officers began digging on the northwest Missouri farm of Ray
Copeland after he and his wife, Faye, were arrested Oct. 9 in an
alleged cattle swindle. They remained jailed on $25,000 bond each,
charged with conspiracy to steal.
   The Copelands have not been named as suspects in the deaths of
four transients whose bodies were found in shallow graves on two
other farms on Oct. 16 and 25.
   However, authorities say Copeland had done odd jobs on those
farms and the four victims had connections to a Springfield mission
where Copeland sometimes appeared to hire help. Investigators
compiled a list of 20 people who had worked for Copeland since
1986, and eight are unaccounted for.
   The digging began after a drifter, Jack McCormick, called an
anti-crime hotline in Nebraska to say he had found a human skull
and legbone on Copeland's farm, Patrol Sgt. Larry Stobbs said.

<HEAD>Former Indian Activist Ordered Deported</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Indian activist Robert
Satiacum was ordered deported to the United States on Thursday,
hours after he was convicted of fondling a 10-year-old girl in an
unrelated case.
   The U.S. government has been trying to extradite the former
chairman of the Puyallup Indian Tribe in Washington state for
several years on embezzlement and racketeering convictions.
   ``I am bound in law to issue you with a deportation order,''
said immigration adjudicator Garry Braunwarth. ``I have no
alternative. The law permits no discretion.''
   Satiacum, 60, who contended he was persecuted in the United
States, lost his bid for refugee status in Canada Nov. 2, allowing
the deportation proceedings to reopen.
   The deportation hearing did not deal with Satiacum's conviction
for sexual touching. Satiacum is to be sentenced on that charge
Nov. 17. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years.
   Lawyers for the Canadian government and Satiacum argued Thursday
over whether he should be deported before he served his sentence on
the sex charge.
   Satiacum's lawyer, Mark Hilford, said the deportation hearing
should be adjourned pending a decision from the Supreme Court of
Canada on Satiacum's claim for refugee status.
   ``It's improper for Immigration Canada to be seen as attempting
an end-run around the Supreme Court of Canada,'' he said.
   Satiacum, who fled to Canada in 1982, faces a lengthy jail
sentence in the United States. His problems began with his battle
over selling tax-free cigarettes on Indian land and escalated from
there.
   He was originally granted political asylum in Canada in 1987 but
the decision was overturned this year.
   Satiacum, who has diabetes and a bad heart, spent three years in
jail while he fought efforts to extradite him.
   Thursday morning, County court Judge Cathy Ryan convicted him of
touching a person under 14 for sexual purposes. ``This verdict is
worse than the verdict of murder,'' a weary-looking Satiacum said.
``It takes away my whole future.''
   Satiacum continued to maintain his innocence, saying he did not
touch the girl in April 1988 while he was staying at a house in
suburban Richmond owned by her grandmother. He said he may appeal
the verdict.
   The girl testified she awoke to find Satiacum with his hand
beneath her underwear. Satiacum testified he had tripped over the
girl, who was asleep on the floor, and fell partly on her but did
not molest her.
   ``I reject Mr. Satiacum's evidence as untruthful,'' the judge
said.

   President Bush has ordered U.S. armed forces
in Germany to give ``all possible assistance'' to help the West
German government cope with the flood of refugees from the East,
the White House said Thursday night.
   ``The United States is responding urgently to a request from the
government of the Federal Republic of Germany for assistance in
accommodating'' the influx of refugees from East Germany, said
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   He noted an earlier announcement by the Pentagon that refugees
will be offered temporary housing for up to six months at three
facilities of the U.S. Air Force in West Germany.
   ``Processing has begun at a U.S. Air Force contingency hospital
at Donaueschingen in the Black Forest,'' he said.
   In addition, the commander of the U.S. Army in Europe
headquartered in Heidelberg ``has inventoried all available
facilities and established a task force, which is in direct contact
with the Federal Government in Bonn,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The president has instructed all U.S. military authorities ...
as well as our embassy in Bonn, to make available to (West Germany)
all possible assistance,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The president salutes the Federal Republic for opening its
doors to so many seeking to resettle in the West and pledges our
full support and assistance.''
   The other facilities in the Pentagon announcement were another
contingency hospital at Zweibruecken in Rhineland Pfalz and a
housing unit at Bitburg awaiting modernization. All are located
away from U.S. military bases.
   The three can house 980 people, the Pentagon said.

   Edhie also helped bring the present government of President
Suharto to power.
   He had been in ill health and under medical treatment since

   Torsten Ryl simply flashed his identity card early
Friday, and for the first time in his life the East German waiter
entered West Berlin.
   ``At the stroke of midnight, they (East German border officials)
told us `The procedure has been shortened, and all you need is a
stamp,''' he said.
   With that, Ryl walked into the West at the Checkpoint Charlie
crossing through the Berlin Wall, where guards had forcibly kept
East Germans out for 28 years.
   ``I've never been here before,'' said Ryl, who like hundreds of
others early Friday took advantage of their Communist government's
decision to open the country's borders.
   ``It's not my intention to stay here, but we have to have the
possibility to come over here and go back again. I have my
apartment and my car over there,'' Ryl said.
   A middle-aged West German reached over and gave him 20 marks
($11) and said with a grin: ``Why don't you go get yourself a beer
first?''
   Several thousand people greeted Ryl and the other East
Berliners; West Berliners held impromptu dances atop the wall and
hoisted people up from the other side of the divided city to join
them.
   Thomas Moll, 21, said he was allowed to cross into West Berlin
in less than five minutes.
   ``I just can't believe it,'' he said. ``A lot of people thought
it was just another trick.''
   Moll said he also intended to return home after having a look
around West Berlin.
   It seemed as if each East Berliner who crossed the demarcation
line was greeted with cheers _ many by hugs and kisses _ by the
crowd at Checkpoint Charlie.
   Traffic jams built up on western side at the checkpoint, and
people streamed out of the Kochstrasse subway stop on the West
Berlin side to join the party.
   There were similar scenes as other border checkpoints.
   ``It's just unbelievable,'' sobbed a middle-aged woman, who said
she just wanted to take a walk in West Berlin.
   Thousands celebrated on the Kurfuerstendamm, a boulevard in West
Berlin's upscale shopping district.
   East German Trabant cars were welcomed by cheers and honking
horns as they slowly wended their way down the boulevard, now the
scene of the wildest celebrations since the Berlin Wall was born in
the Cold War.

<TEXT>
   The head of a Justice Department unit that
prosecuted anti-war protestors during the Nixon administration was
forced to retire following a conviction for sexual batttery, it was
disclosed Thursday.
   Guy L. Goodwin, who traveled the country in the early 1970s
obtaining controversial indictments against anti-war protestors and
political radicals, retired last year following his conviction in
Wichita, Kan.
   Goodwin's case was noted in a report released Thursday by the
Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility. The
report did not identify Goodwin by name, but the case had received
publicity in Wichita.
   Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that the report referred to Goodwin.
   Goodwin was arrested in an adult bookstore on Feb. 9, 1988 after
making a sexual advance to a male undercover police officer,
according to accounts in the Wichita Eagle and a summary of the
incident in the Justice Department report.
   Goodwin pleaded no contest to a sexual battery charge and was
fined $100 and placed on probation. Sexual battery is touching in a
sexual context.
   Goodwin joined the Justice Department in the late 1960s and
gained noteriety for heading a Justice Department unit started by
the Nixon administration to investigate ``revolutionary
terrorists.''
   Grand jury investigations that Goodwin conducted around the
country returned scores of indictments against anti-war activists
but resulted in only a few convictions.
   Most of the charges were either dismissed or defendants were
acquitted. Defense attorneys frequently alleged prosecutorial
misconduct, including the use of agents provacateurs.
   One of the more noted cases was the unsuccessful prosecution of
Dr. Benjamin Spock, the pediatrician, child-care writer and
anti-war activists, in Boston.
   In another case, eight members of the Vietnam Veterans Against
the War were accused of plotting to disrupt the 1972 Republican
National Convention in Miami.
   All eight defendants were acquitted and later filed a suit
charging that Goodwin violated their constitutional rights by lying
to a judge during the grand jury investigation that preceded their
indictment.

   Prospective jurors were questioned about
drunken driving Thursday in the murder trial of a man accused of
killing 27 people, mostly children, when he slammed into a church
bus with his pickup truck.
   Carroll County Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite dismissed two
people during jury selection in the trial of Larry Mahoney, 36,
after they said they had lost relatives to accidents involving
drunken drivers.
   Three other prospective jurors said they had relatives who had
been in legal trouble for driving under the influence. They were
not immediately released from the jury pool.
   ``Obviously, that's going to be a very great topic for
individual questioning,'' said defense attorney William Summers.
Before the trial, Summers said he would look for jurors who had an
understanding of the widespread incidence of drunken driving.
   The 1988 accident was considered the deadliest in U.S. history
to be blamed on drunken driving.
   Prospective jurors were also asked about previous jury service
in the second day of jury selection in this county seat about 40
miles northeast of Louisville. Other questions included whether
they were related to anyone involved in the trial and issues
expected to be raised during the trial.
   Some jurors were dismissed for such routine reasons as a family
sickness or full-time student status.
   Attorneys plan to interview prospective jurors privately next
week.
   Mahoney is accused of driving the wrong way on Interstate 71 on
May 14, 1988 when his pickup truck slammed into a bus from the
Radcliff Assembly of God church. Twenty-seven people, all but three
of them children, died in the fiery crash.
   Mahoney was found to have a blood-alcohol content of .24, nearly
2{ times the limit of .10 for being considered legally intoxicated.
   Mahoney is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton
endangerment, 12 counts of assault and one of driving under the
influence.
   If convicted of all charges, he faces a maximum sentence of 27
life prison terms plus 450 years.
   Jury selection was expected to last at least through next week.

   A Justice Department official resigned in 1988
following an investigation of suspicions that he disclosed
classified information to a foreign government, said a report
released Thursday.
   The annual report of the department's Office of Professional
Responsibility said a counterintelligence investigation did not
produce sufficient evidence to prosecute the official but
determined he should be dismissed.
   The report did not identify the official, but Roger Pilon,
former head of the Justice Department's Office of Asylum Policy and
Review, confirmed he was the subject of parallel investigations by
the FBI and the Office of Professional Responsiblity in 1988.
   Justice Department and FBI officials refused to comment on the
case. But a source who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed
that Pilon had been the subject of an FBI counterintelligence
investigation.
   Pilon insists that he is innocent of the allegation that he or
his wife, Juliana, passed a secret State Department document about
communist influence in South Africa to the South African government.
   And Pilon produced a 1988 letter from a senior Justice
Department official stating that he was being reinstated after the
investigations.
   ``No implication adverse to you should be taken from the
investigations,'' said the letter by Dee V. Benson, then the
principal associate deputy attorney general.
   Pilon said he accepted reinstatement at the department, which
restored his security clearance, but he then left to join the Cato
Institute, a libertarian think tank where he is now a senior fellow.
   ``Something is going on and it stinks if people like us can be
dragged through the mud,'' said Pilon. ``It's been a nightmare, a
Kafkaesque nightmare.''
   Pilon said FBI agents showed him the State Department documents
while his wife was undergoing a FBI background check for
appointment as an assistant secretary of the interior.
   The agents ``plopped this document on my desk'' and said ```That
document is now in the hands of South Africa. You gave it to your
wife, your wife gave it to the South Africans.'''
   Pilon said he and his wife, then an analyst at the Heritage
Foundation, both passed government polygraph tests, commonly called
lie detector tests. But the investigation dragged on and his wife
was never nominated for the job at the Interior Department.
   The Jan. 8, 1987, document in question was a secret assessment
of the influence of communism in South Africa produced by the State
Department. Pilon had worked at State as policy director of the
Bureau of Human Rights before joining the Justice Department in
March, 1987.
   Pilon said he suspects the FBI had monitored a conversation
between his wife, who studied United Nations affairs, and an
official of the South African mission in New York.
   The phone calls with Chris Camp, a public affairs attache at the
South African mission, took place in January or February of 1987,
Pilon said.
   ``She had been trying to get documents from him about communist
activity at the United Nations. He wanted material she had been
working on.''
   ``Undoubtedly there was a conversation (about) an exchange of
documents,'' Pilon said, who insisted his wife never passed along
he document FBI agents had shown him.
   Pilon said the FBI is apparently still investigating what
happened to the document. Two of the same FBI agents had recently
approached a friend, Pilon said, and asked about the document.
   ``I can only speculate as to what's going on here. I really
don't know,'' Pilon said.

   The Soviet government advised the West on Thursday
to dismiss any speculation about a reunified Germany now because
that ``is out of the question.''
   In the first government comment on the changes convulsing the
Soviet Union's ally, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov praised East Germany for its leadership shake-up and its
first steps toward Soviet-style reforms.
   He told a news briefing that although it was not the Soviet
Union's place to comment on another country's internal affairs, it
was clear East Germany was undertaking a ``renewal of socialism.''
   Gerasimov called East Germany an ``important, one might say,
strategic ally'' of the Soviet Union and said Moscow is closely
following events there.
   In its account of the briefing, the official news agency Tass
reported:
   ``Commenting on deliberations in the Western press about the
possible reunification of Germany, ... (Gerasimov) said,
specifically, that this matter `cannot be viewed apart from the
overall situation in Europe, which is, as of yet, split into two
alliances.'
   ``He appraised the deliberations in the press as an `occupation
not related to practical policy.'''
   Gerasimov said, ``If we remain on real ground, any unification
of Germany is out of question now.''
   Germany's division into communist East Germany and capitalistic
West Germany followed the collapse of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany
in World War II. East Germany now is being shaken by mass demands
for more democracy and by an exodus of East Germans to West
Germany, prompting the changes there this week.
   Gerasimov said Thursday that the East German leadership is
``improving the situation in the sense that they're moving toward
perestroika on their own terms,'' referring to the reforms
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev began on coming to power in 1985.
   Millions of Soviets learned in TV, radio and newspaper reports
of the dramatic overhaul of East Germany's ruling Politburo and new
leader Egon Krenz's promises of democratic reforms.
   Tass quickly reported that the East German government had thrown
open all borders and that its citizens could travel or emigrate
anywhere.
   Vyacheslav Mostovoy, a correspondent reporting on Soviet
television's popular nightly news program Vremya, said East
Germany's Central Committee had begun mapping political and
economic reforms in a ``program which the whole country awaits and
on which the future of the republic largely depends.''
   Mostovoy, reporting from East Germany, stressed the elevation of
reformers to the Politburo. He quoted Krenz as saying in a speech
that the East German communist party leadership had earlier taken a
negative approach to changes in the Soviet Union and other
socialist countries.
   Krenz's predecessor, Erich Honecker, had been cool to
Gorbachev's reforms and resisted implementing them in his own
country. But Krenz told Gorbachev in a telephone call last month
that ``there are important lessons to be learned from Soviet
perestroika in the German Democratic Republic.''
   During a visit to Moscow, Krenz discussed possible applications
in East Germany of Soviet-style reforms.
   ``We wholeheartedly support the revolutionary process of
perestroika in the Soviet Union,'' he told reporters, adding he
especially wanted to explore its aim of making socialism ``more
attractive.''
   In its reports on East German developments, Radio Moscow focused
on that government's plans for a party conference and Krenz's call
for more democracy.
   Tass issued at least four reports. One report said the changes
the Central Committee is discussing ``came from the street'' and
that the party must admit its mistakes or lose its right to govern.
   Tass ran excerpts of Krenz's 86-page speech Wednesday to the
Central Committee, highlighting his remarks on the former
government's hostility toward the Soviet reforms.
   It quoted Krenz's condemnation of the old Politburo's ``negative
wait-and-see attitude and partly dogmatic and haughty attitude to
processes taking place in the Soviet Union and other socialist
countries.''
   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia also gave readers
details of Krenz's speech and reported the continuing mass exodus
of East Germans.
   On Wednesday, Vremya showed Mostovoy standing against the
backdrop of an outdoor public protest in Berlin and describing the
``exceptionally important political events'' in East Germany this
week.
   ``The process of reform and renewal that started just a few
weeks ago is continuing with unusual quickness,'' Mostovoy said in
a report of about three minutes that came halfway through the
45-minute show.

   Hungary has granted asylum to two
Soviet bloc citizens, the first refugees to benefit from its
decision to join the U.N. Convention on the rights of refugees, a
newspaper said Thursday.
   The trade union daily Nepszava identified them as a Soviet from
the Ukraine and a Bulgarian. Their names were not available.
   It quoted Laszlo Albrecht, deputy head of the Refugee Affairs
Department, as saying 44 applications for political asylum were
filed, with one case rejected and 41 still under review.
   Albrecht said the Soviet citizen was jailed and then fired from
his job after taking part in demonstrations, and later fled to
Hungary, according to the paper. It quoted him as saying the
Bulgarian suffered discrimination after defending the rights of the
Turkish minority in his country.
   On March 14, Hungary became the first Soviet bloc country to
join the U.N. Convention on refugees' rights. It came into force
June 12. On Oct. 15, a government decree bringing the country's
legislation in line with the convention went into effect. The two
people are the first to have formally been granted asylum in
Hungary under these terms.
   Hungary accepted the convention for European refugees only. It
commits authorities not to return anyone to a country where his
``life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race,
religion, nationality ... or political opinion.''

<TEXT>
   Governors meeting with Bush administration
officials said Thursday that work on national education goals is on
a ``very, very fast track'' and they are now ready to work with
Congress.
   The meeting between leaders of the National Governors
Association and White House officials was a follow-up to the
education summit between President Bush and the nation's governors
in September.
   Congress and educators had been excluded from the two-day
discussions in Charlottesville, Va. that concluded nationwide goals
are needed to improve learning.
   ``The involvement of the Congress is essential in my opinion,
and in the opinion of the White House and others, as we seek to
form a true coalition between the Congress, the states and the
executive branch of the White House in trying to build a consensus
to improve education in the country,'' said South Carolina Gov.
Carroll Campbell after the White House meeting.
   Not only will Congress be courted, but the governors decided to
seek the advice of experts and recommendations from educators and
business executives communities at a Dec. 7 meeting.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, NGA chairman, said Congress will be
asked to begin immediately to work on legislation that would bring
more flexibility to what is now considered rigid regulations
attached to many federal programs.
   Loosening restrictions on federal funds was one target chosen at
the Charlottesville meeting.
   Other summit goals were to improve early childhood programs,
reorganize school systems to make educators more accountable, keep
drugs out of schools, bolster on-the-job education, improve
literacy and reduce dropouts.
   Branstad said Thursday's meeting with Chief of Staff John
Sununu; Roger Porter, the president's domestic policy adviser;
Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget;
and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos was ``very constructive'' and
``we've agreed that we're going to continue to work to develop the
national goals for education.''
   After the Dec. 7 Task Force on Education meeting, the governors
will hold state hearings and discussions in their respective states
in December and January, said NGA Vice Chairman Booth Gardner of
Washington state.

   Here are excerpts from the toasts President
Bush and Philippines President Corazon Aquino exchanged at Thursday
night's state dinner:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>PRESIDENT BUSH</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Part of the enduring friendship between our nations has been
on our shared sacrifices as we fought together side by side _ a
poignant reminder in these turbulent days of the cost of freedom.
...
   ``We want to help the Philippines strengthen its democracy and
continue its economic recovery, and we've offered our belief that a
new long-term security agreement will enhance our mutual security.
... A new agreement will preserve bipartisan support for this
continued economic and military aid.''
   ``Part of America's love of the Philippines is based on pure
unabashed sentiment and optimism. Americans have cheered the people
power ... revolution, which galvanized the world, inspiring
freedom-loving people everywhere. And you, Mrs. President, proved
that ballots are stronger than bullets, and that while democracy
can be delayed, ultimately it cannot be denied.
   ``And your accomplishments since 1986 are monumental: a new
constitution in 1987; free elections for thousands of local and
national leaders, the restoration of press freedom and other civil
liberties, and in just a few short years the Philippines has gone
from a deep recession to steady economic growth. And we urge you to
continue with the free market reforms needed to spur Philippine
economic development.
   ``Political and economic freedom are the destiny of the
Philippine people, and the destiny of the American people must be
and is to stand with you.''
   ``You have said that being a grandparent makes you happier than
being president. Well, Cory, if you'll excuse the informality, that
just's one more thing that you and I agree on,'' he said, raising a
glass and toasting to U.S.-Philippine friendship and ``to a better
world for our grandchildren and for children everywhere.''

<BYLINE>PRESIDENT AQUINO</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ``I have returned to the United States in a world much changed
by startling events. In Central Europe the men of iron vision are
loosening peacefully their long grip on power.''
   Recalling her own country's revolution, she said, ``The memory
of that stirring event is engraved in the heart of all Filipinos
who lived through it and deeply impressed in the memory of the
world.''
   ``The Philippines is a small country and cannot claim to affect
directly events beyond its borders. Certainly not across half the
world in Europe. Yet it is not too much to say that the images of
heroism spawned by our people power revolution gave dominated
peoples throughout the world a glimpse of certain possibilities
that they are now exploring _ the possibility, for example, that
armor and infantry do not exhaust the varieties of power; that
perhaps people by peaceful numbers and unshakeable resolve may
sometimes tilt the balance in their favor _ as they saw it happen
in my country and as it has happened in other parts of the world
since then.
   ``For the first time in a long time something different has
happened in the world, and perhaps the Philippines had something to
do with it. If so, then we have simply returned the favor for the
support we received from friends of liberty throughout the world.''
   ``Anything new is fragile and I share the apprehension of
President Bush that on this bright new age of tolerance and
freedom, the darkness may yet fall abruptly. It has happened in one
country. ... We must remain prepared for that dark contingency, yet
we must do everything prudent possible and prudent to encourage
those who are working for change.
   ``In this desire for constructive change and movement toward
democracy, we are one with the United States. We look to the United
States as the natural leader in this great movement. She has ever
been in the forefront of the modern struggle for both peace and
freedom.''
   Referring to Bush, she said, ``As a man who lived through war,
he knows the price of peace; as I who lived through tyranny know
the irreplaceable value of freedom.''
   ``This sense of new possibilities must inform the future
relations of the United States and the Philippines, and guide the
discussions we shall have. It is time for something new to happen
in the world, and we are all so privileged to be a part of it.''

<TEXT>
   Islamic fundamentalists stunned
pro-government candidates by taking 34 of the 80 seats in
Parliament in Jordan's first general election in 22 years,
according to results reported Thursday.
   Fundamentalists rolled up huge totals in Wednesday's election
while powerful former government officials struggled to win and
sometimes failed.
   The outcome appeared a setback for King Hussein, who urged
voters not to mix religion with politics.
   It also was a disappointment to Jordanian women, who ran and
voted in their first national election. None won of the 12 women
among 647 parliamentary candidates won.
   Victors included men once imprisoned on political grounds and
one convicted in an attack on an Israeli airline office in Athens.
   The new Parliament seems certain to be more assertive than the
often passive legislature dissolved last year. Hussein retains
ultimate power, however, and martial law in effect since the 1967
Arab-Israeli war continues.
   Parliament must approve all laws and can dismiss governments,
but the king can dissolve the legislature and rule without it, as
he has done for much of the past 15 years.
   Israeli officials, who regard Hussein as a moderate Arab leader,
expressed some concern about the election results. One said, on
condition of anonymity: ``What we are speaking about is a
substantial opposition to the king from the right. ... This might
bring a problem for the king.''
   In the vanguard of the fundamentalist campaign was the Moslem
Brotherhood. Its 26 declared and several allied candidates called
for social justice, stricter Islamic morality and the destruction
of Israel.
   ``The people want Islam and it is not strange ... to have such a
large number of Moslem candidates winning,'' Brotherhood spokesman
Ziad Abu Ghanimeh said.
   Fundamentalists often have allied themselves with Hussein, a
descendant of the prophet Mohammed, against secular leftists, but
have pressed him for restrictions on Western-type entertainment,
more social welfare programs and greater separation of the sexes.
   Final results gave 22 seats to Brotherhood candidates. Other
Islamists won 12 seats, and some of the 20 or so pro-government
figures also had links to the Islamic movement.
   Leftists, Arab nationalists, tribal leaders and others took the
rest of the seats.
   Parliament's makeup gives the varied opposition a clear majority
over royalists. In their campaigns, many winners demanded
prosecution of former officials accused of corruption and, because
of the nation's $8.3 billion foreign debt, of economic
mismanagement.
   The 80 seats are divided among 20 districts, and more than 40
candidates ran in some of them.
   Three men who resigned powerful posts to run barely made it.
   Former Deputy Premier Taher Masri edged out a Brotherhood
candidate in his Amman district but finished far behind the leader,
another fundamentalist.
   Thouqan Hindawi, former head of the Royal Court, won a seat in
Irbid but got only half as many votes as the top candidate, a
member of the Brotherhood. Abdul-Raouf al Rawabdeh, former mayor of
Amman, finished eighth in the same race, just enough to win a place
in Parliament.
   Those losing included Hamdi Tabaa, the former trade and industry
minister, and the former public works minister, Shawfiq Zawaideh.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
applauded the renewal of the electoral process in Jordan.
   ``We fully support the process of poliitcal reform that
accompanies it. We note that the polling proceeeding peacefully and
in a fair and orderly fashion,'' he said.
   He added that the United States looks forward to working with
the new government in Jordan once it is installed.
   After four days of price riots in southern Jordan in April,
Hussein moved up the election date and increased personal and press
freedom.
   Although political parties are banned, the government did not
enforce the prohibition and many ran slates of candidates openly.
   One new member of Parliament is Mansour Murad, convicted in
Greece of participating in a 1969 attack on an Athens office of
El-Al, the Israeli airline, in which a Greek child was killed and
11 people were injured.
   Greek authorities freed Mansour in 1970 in an exchange for 55
hostages on a hijacked Olympic Airways jetliner.
   The election formalized Jordan's separation from the West Bank,
which held half the seats in the parliament elected two months
before Israel captured the territory in 1967. Last year, Hussein
renounced Jordan's claims to the West Bank in favor the Palestine
Liberation Organization.

   Unseasonably high temperatures warmed the Northwest and Florida

cities. Scattered rain fell in the East and the Midwest.
   Snow showers fell from northern lower Michigan and upper
Michigan to western Wisconsin and southeast Minnesota. Rain
continued along the northern Pacific Coast.
   Scattered rain fell from western New York state to northern
Illinois and southern Wisconsin.
   The mercury climbed to 90 degrees in Hollywood, Fla., snapping
by 3 degrees the record for the date set in 1983.
   Records were also set at the Miami airport (89 degrees, 88 in
1958); Pendleton, Ore. (72, 70 in 1971); and Lewiston, Idaho (66,

   The high temperature for the nation was 91 degrees at the North
Dade County Airport near Miami.
   In contrast, a cold front moving across the Atlantic Coast
states brought lower temperatures west of the front. A frost
warning for Thursday was in effect for the mountains of western
South Carolina.
   High-wind warnings remained in effect for the eastern slopes of
the mountains of northwest Wyoming and in Wyoming for the upper

   Hundreds of U.S. and Bolivian agents
raided 11 cocaine labs in eastern Bolivia and arrested 25 people as
drug trafficking suspects, police said Thursday.
   Six airplanes and eight helicopters on Wednesday ferried the
agents to the cattle ranching town of San Ramon, 250 miles
northeast of La Paz, where they arrested 17 people and raided and
destroyed 11 clandestine laboratories for producing cocaine
hydrochloride, police said.
   It was the biggest single sweep since a 3-month operation in
1986.
   Other raiders invaded dozens of homes and shops in the country's
second most populous city, Santa Cruz, 355 miles east of La Paz,
and arrested eight people, including two Colombian chemists, police
said.
   About 350 members of Bolivia's U.S.-trained anti-narcotics
force, called the Leopards, and 30 U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agents took part in the raids, police said.
   They appeared to signal an intensification of Bolivia's
anti-drug efforts, in line with President Bush's recent call for an
all-out international effort against narcotics trafficking.
   ``The purpose of these raids is to dismantle Bolivia's principal
cocaine- producing operations,'' said Don Ferrone, U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration station chief for Bolivia, after
returning from the raid.
   ``It is a new strategy and we are going right at the biggest
organizations and they will have serious problems in the future.''
   Two of those arrested in San Ramon were Argentines carrying
automatic weapons and grenades, the DEA said.
   Dozens of other people were initially caught up in the sweeps
but were cleared of suspicion and quickly released.

<HEAD>House Panel Warned Against Piecemeal Health-Care Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoping to move beyond Medicare's doomed
catastrophic illness program, a House committee on Thursday
examined a series of proposals to rework the nation's health care
system and avoid piecemeal reform.
   Douglas Fraser, chairman of the private Committee for a National
Health Insurance, told the House Select Committee on Aging that the
nation's health-care delivery system is ``an absolute shambles''
that leaves many people unprotected and saddles others with huge
costs.
   ``We have to make fundamental changes,'' said Fraser, former
president of the United Auto Workers union. ``Patchwork will not do
it.''
   He said there is growing support for a national health insurance
program, even among major employers who no longer can keep up with
rising health-care costs.
   Committee Chairman Edward Roybal, D-Calif., who himself has
proposed a health-care reform package, said the hearing was
designed to find solutions to ``the nation's cost, quality and
access problems and for building an American health system.'' Up to
37 million Americans are uninsured and many more are underinsured,
particularly against the staggering costs of long-term care, he
said.
   Roybal cited the year-old Medicare catastrophic coverage program
as an example of a piecemeal attempt to improve the health-care
system. Congress is on the verge of scrapping all or part of the
program after being inundated with complaints that its cost were
too high and its benefits unneeded by some senior citizens.
   The blue-ribbon U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive
Health Care, established as part of the catastrophic legislation,
also is looking for answers to the problems of the uninsured and
the costs of long-term care.
   Deborah Steelman, chair of the Advisory Council on Social
Security, which also has been asked to examine the nation's
health-care system, told the Aging Committee that determining who
will pay for new health-care benefits is always the ``sticky
wicket'' but that the government could do much more with what it
already is spending.
   Fraser's group is pushing a plan that would retain the Medicare
program for the elderly and cover everyone else through a
state-administered program financed perhaps through payroll taxes,
private insurance premiums, alcohol and tobacco taxes and state
sources.
   Another plan was advanced by Paul Rogers, a former congressman
who co-chairs the private National Leadership Commission on Health
Care. The commission's plan would retain Medicare and private
insurance programs and add a state-administered universal access
plan for the uninsured, financed by fees paid by employers and
people with income above 150 percent of poverty.
   ``Limited access, soaring costs and uncertain quality interact
with the malpractice crisis to form a tightly woven web,'' Rogers
said. ``We need to take the best features of this intricate design
and weave them into a renewed system of health care.''
   Graham Scott, former Ontario deputy minister of health, told the
committee that Canada's national health insurance program is
immensely popular at home, but success there ``does not mean that
it is necessarily the answer for the United States'' because of
cultural differences.

   The infant boy born to a pregnant shooting victim
died Thursday, two weeks after his mother was shot to death and his
father wounded when they were held up outside a childbirth class.
   Christopher Stuart died at 4:34 p.m. at Brigham and Woman's
Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Cathleen O'Donnell. She
declined to release the cause of death.
   The Suffolk County coroner and officials at the district
attorney's office were not immediately available for comment.
   ``Everybody in the city of Boston was really praying beyond hope
that Christopher would make it,'' Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn
said Thursday night.
   The baby had struggled for life in the hospital's neo-natal
intensive care unit since his delivery by emergency Caesarian
section hours after his mother was shot Oct. 23.
   Carol Stuart, 30, a lawyer who was seven months pregnant, was
shot in the head by a gunman who held up the couple in their car
after they left the hospital near the Roxbury section of Boston.
   Charles Stuart, 29, who managed to contact rescuers with his
cellular car telephone, was shot in the abdomen and listed in
stable condition Thursday at Boston City Hospital, a spokesman said.
   At the father's request, family members declined Thursday night
to comment on the infant's death.
   ``It's a very difficult time for all of us and we're just trying
to follow Chuck's wishes,'' said Mrs. Stuart's brother, Carl
DiMaiti.
   The attack on the Stuarts, who traveled from their suburban home
to the city for its medical facilities, launched a city-wide search
for the assailant, who was still at large Thursday night.
   ``There aren't words to describe the sadness and tragedy,''
O'Donnell said. ``This horror struck in Boston on a city street and
that's difficult for a hospital that values life so much.''
   Residents in the Mission Hill neighborhood where the attack took
place expressed little hope this week that the gunman would be
caught, but Flynn said Thursday that police were pursuing strong
leads.
   Flynn said he didn't know if prosecutors would attempt to bring
double-murder charges if a suspect was arrested, ``but the
senseless, tragic act resulted in the deaths of two innocent
people, as far as I'm concerned.''
   ``It hits home when you lose a little baby to the senseless
violence that's taking place in our communities,'' the mayor said.
``We have to recommit ourselves in the memory of all people who
have been innocent victims of violence to make the streets safe for
everyone.''

<TEXT>
   China castigated the U.S. Congress on Thursday
for pressing ahead with plans for sanctions against Beijing, saying
sanctions would ``cast a new shadow'' over Chinese-American ties.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua also singled out
Washington as being ``too deeply involved'' in the pro-democracy
movement here last spring that was suppressed by Chinese troops.
   If sanctions against China are adopted, ``it will cast a new
shadow over Chinese-U.S. relations and ... will hurt the feelings
of the Chinese people,'' she told a weekly news conference.
   Negotiators from the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives
agreed on Tuesday to stiffen proposed sanctions against China to
protest the June crackdown.
   The measure asks two years of trade sanctions, including
suspension of trade assistance; a halt to certain insurance for
firms doing business in China, and a freeze on exports of
satellites, semimilitary items such as helicopters, and certain
nuclear material and components.
   The bill condemns the ``unprovoked, brutal and indiscriminate
assault'' on the protesters, which it said left at least 700 dead.
   China has said about 300 people died.
   ``At present, Chinese-U.S. relations are in a period of great
difficulties,'' Ms. Li said. ``China should not be held responsible
for the difficulties. The reason for these difficulties is that the
U.S. has gotten itself too deeply involved in the turmoil and
rebellion that happened not too long ago in Beijing.''
   China insists the protests were whipped up by
``counterrevolutionaries'' seeking to overthrow the communist
regime, and says foreign forces supported the uprising.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping also told visiting former President
Richard Nixon last week that the United States was ``too deeply
involved'' in the demonstrations, and China was ``the real victim''
of the events at the time.
   The U.S. government rejects the charges. A State Department
spokesman said this month that the protests ``were clearly the
result of domestic developments in China.''

   U.S. action against Norway because of its
persistence in hunting whales has been indefinitely postponed, a
spokesman for Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said Thursday.
   Reed Boatright, Mosbacher's spokesman, said a decision had been
due next Monday on whether Norway was violating U.S. law by
interfering with the ban of the International Whaling Conference on
commercial whaling. He said there would now be negotiations with
Norway's new government, headed by Conservative Prime Minister Jan
P. Syse.
   The Norwegian Labor government ousted last month allowed the
taking of 17 whales this year, which it said were for scientific
research. U.S. conservationists, who campaign against all whaling,
say that Norwegian whalers used to take about 2,000 a year and that
17 are not enough for any scientific or commercial purpose.
   Syse's trade minister, Kaci Kullmann Five, had a meeting with
Mosbacher on Thursday. Afterwards, she said Norway would take five
whales next year.
   ``There will not be any certification on Nov. 13,'' Mrs. Five
said in an interview. ``No date has been set.'' She said she
expected ``positive developments'' in future talks.
   Boatright would not say if the United States agreed with Mrs.
Five on further whaling. He said that after negotiations with
Norway, Mosbacher will make a recommendation to President Bush. If
Bush certifies that Norway is interfering with the international
ban, he may restrict or even halt Norwegian shipments of fish to
the United States.
   Roger Payne, senior scientist at the World Wildlife Fund,
predicted a strong reaction from conservationists in the United
States who campaign vigorously to end all whaling.
   ``The conservation community will be jumping all over the
administration if it agrees to that,'' he said, referring to the
Norwegian insistence on continued whaling.
   ``The Norwegians are the only ones doing any whaling except the
Japanese. This would prevent the Japanese from being isolated.''
   Conservationists say the Japanese take about 300 whales a year,
also for what they say are scientific purposes.

<HEAD>White House May Bypass Senate With `Recess Appointments'</HEAD>

   The Bush administration, frustrated by Senate
delays on its nominations, may give some of its 119 languishing
nominees ``recess appointments'' not requiring Senate action, White
House officials said Thursday.
   Such a parlimentary end run around the Senate's
advice-and-consent powers would surely anger Democatic leaders and
worsen already-strained relations between President Bush and
Congress.
   White House personnel director Chase Untermeyer said he was
preparing recommendations for Bush on the procedures for making a
possible batch of recess appointments during Congress' upcoming
year-end break.
   ``I've done it on my own without the direction of the president
or the chief of staff (John Sununu),'' said Untermeyer. However, he
added, ``I've not been told to stop.''
   Untermeyer said there were 119 presidential appointments pending
as of late Thursday.
   Another White House official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said, ``We're not anxious to do this. This is only a
last resort. But it is something we may be compelled to do,'' said
a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Under the Constitution, the president can temporarily sidestep
the Senate's confirmation powers by appointing a person to fill a
vacancy while the Senate is in recess.
   The provision was put into the Constitution to enable the
government to continue to function when the Senate took long
recesses _ sometimes, in the early days of the Republic, for months
at a time.
   Someone granted such a ``recess appointment'' may serve, under
the Constitution, until the end of the next session of Congress.
   Were Bush to appoint someone during the upcoming yearend recess,
that individual could keep the job at least until the end of 1990
without the Senate having a say.
   Nearly all presidents have made recess appointments from time to
time. And it is a favored tactic for giving political supporters
short-term jobs like ambassadorships near the end of a presidential
term.
   However, the device has never been used in a wholesale fashion
before.
   ``The president really hasn't wanted to resort to this. But
neither did he realize that some many of his nominees wouldn't be
acted on this late on,'' said a White House official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Such a move has high political risks and would escalate the
battle between Bush and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine.
   Up until now, Bush himself has not advocated such a drastic
step, White House sources said. But senior advisers might urge him
to take such a course in an effort to break the Senate logjam, the
sources said.
   Untermeyer's work on the question first was reported in Thursday
editions of The Washington Times.
   Among the pending nominations are Richard G. Austin as head of
the General Services Administration, Barbara Everitt Bryant as
director of the Census Bureau, Brian W. Clymer as urban mass
transportation administrator, Michael Paul Gavin as assistant
secretary of commerce and a host of ambassadorial and judicial
appointments.
   Some of the delayed nominations have been controversial.
   For instance, Bush's choice of James Cason for a top Agriculture
Department post has drawn opposition from environmentalists and
many senators for what they allege to be a pro-development bias.
   And some ambassadorial appointments have been blocked by Senate
Democrats who claim they have few qualifications other than large
contributions to Republican campaigns.
   In fact, on Thursday, Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., vowing to end
an ``ambassadorial spoils system,'' sought to kill Bush's
nomination of Joy Silverman as ambassador to Barbados. `There are
no qualifications for this lady. There's nothing there,'' Sarbannes
told the Senate.
   The nomination of Victor Stello Jr. to be assistant secretary of
energy for defense programs has been stalled since July over
criticism of his record at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. And
the nomination of Vaugh R. Walker to be a federal judge in Northern
California has been snarled in neoptism charge. He is Bush's cousin.
   At a news conference on Tuesday, Bush accused the Democratic-led
Congress of ``blocking everything I do'' and has often vented his
frustration at the slow pace of Senate consideration of his
nominees.
   And Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater earlier accused the Senate
of holding up dozens of presidential appointments ``for artificial
reasons.''
   At the same time, however, Mitchell has accused Bush of
foot-dragging on other key government positions.
   The Maine Democrat told the Senate recently that Bush had failed
to ``make nominations for nearly half'' of the key executive branch
jobs and that Bush's criticism was ``unfounded and unfair.''
   Many of Bush's ambassadorial nominations have been delayed in
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee _ where Democratic leaders
have accused the president of seeking to fill many of the posts
with political supporters rather than experienced diplomats.
   If Bush does choose to make recess appointments, the Senate
loses its power to deny the individual the post for more than a
year. But there are other ways that Congress can make its will felt.
   ``If the recess appointee wanted to get paid, it might be a
problem,'' said an official in the Senate parlimentarian's office,
who spoke on the condition of anoymity.

   Charles Feather cried as he told how he
pulled a seriously burned baby girl and a pregnant woman from their
apartment after a Navy jet crashed, setting the complex on afire.
   ``I saw the plane pop and all the lights go off,'' said Feather,
a maintenance supervisor at an apartment complex beside Pine
Village Apartments, where the plane crash touched off a raging fire.
   ``I found the baby girl, and she was burnt,'' he said. ``Then I
found the pregnant woman, and the paramedics showed up.
   ``I just wanted to help. People tend to help other people out in
situations like this,'' he said.
   Others who lived in the apartment complex or had friends living
there stood on an embankment on Smyrna-Roswell Road watching the
rescue efforts and relating similar stories.
   Jim McDonald was in his Pine Village apartment when the plane
crashed. His voice filled with emotion, McDonald said he felt lucky
to be alive.
   ``I was upstairs when I heard a dull thump,'' he said. ``I went
downstairs and opened the door and saw fire trucks and a bright
orange glow. ... I saw a wing tip and a big ball of fire. The whole
back corner of the building was in flames, and I saw somebody lying
near the flames.''
   He said he was unable to make his way to the ``silhouette or a
shadow of a person'' he saw.
   Martin Singleton, who was not at home when the plane crashed,
said his apartment was destroyed in the flames.
   ``I was worried about not having a coffee table in my apartment.
Now, I don't have an apartment,'' he said.

   Closer-than-predicted margins in Virginia's
gubernatorial election and New York's mayoral contest may have a
simple explanation, some pollsters say: Survey respondents lied.
   That could explain why black candidates in the two races ran
less well Tuesday than expected. The theory is that voters who
opposed them hesitated to say so for fear of appearing bigoted.
   It even has a name: ``The Bradley effect,'' for Los Angeles
Mayor Tom Bradley, a black Democrat who led in the polls in his
1982 race for governor only to lose narrowly to his white opponent,
George Deukmejian.
   ``I think a lot of people cast their votes on race, and it's
something that's not easily measured by polls,'' pollster Brad
Coker said Wednesday. ``People are not going to freely admit
they're racists to strangers.''

   Major airlines officials are raising strong
objections to congressional moves to reimpose government control
over their industry.
   A Senate subcommittee heard testimony Wednesday on legislation
that would alter several practices sponsors say have driven small
airlines out of business and kept others from starting up.
   Calling for even stronger action, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, introduced the Airline Reregulation Act that would allow
the government once again to regulate fares, routes, and services.
The industry was deregulated by Congress in 1978.
   ``I don't know if complete reregulation is the answer,''
Metzenbaum said. ``But I do know it's time we owned up to the fact
that airline deregulation was a mistake.''

   Trucks and railcars are hauling garbage into
America's breadbasket and then carrying food on the way back with
little or no cleaning in between, according to testimony on Capitol
Hill.
   Witnesses told a House panel of trucks that carry meat and solid
waste on alternate trips, trailers that haul food along with
insects left from garbage runs and diesel fuel from one shipment
seeping into flour in the next cargo.
   ``Would you like your bacon and eggs delivered on any of these
trucks?'' Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., asked the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials
on Wednesday.
   The subcommittee is considering legislation on hazardous
materials safety, including a ban on so-called ``backhauling'' of
garbage to Midwestern dumps after shipments of food to the east.

   Only President Bush's promised signature is
needed for the first minimum wage increase in nearly a decade,
following Congress' lopsided approval of a bill raising the rate to
$4.25 by April 1991.
   The measure _ which includes a subminimum wage for teen-agers
new to the job market _ cleared the Senate on an 89-8 vote
Wednesday, exactly a week after it passed the House by an equally
overwhelming vote of 382-37.
   Bush, who struck the compromise plan with congressional
Democrats last week, is expected to sign the bill before
Thanksgiving, perhaps as early as next week.
   ``The nine-year logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken,''
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said after the Senate vote. ``The
working poor are about to receive an increase, although it is not
as much as they deserve.''

   The National Endowment for the Arts is

violate a new federal anti-obscenity law.
   Artists Space, the private Manhattan arts institution that is
sponsoring the exhibition, notified NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer
on Wednesday that its 23-member board had unanimously rejected his
request to relinquish the tax-paid grant.
   In response, Frohnmayer said the endowment will withhold the
$10,000 in grant money pending a legal opinion from the Justice
Department.
   ``We haven't paid out the funds, and we don't intend to do so,''
Frohnmayer said in a telephone interview.

<TEXT>
   This is ratings ``sweeps'' time, and you face
considerable Nielsen-boosting sex, violence, and bad manners on TV.
But there are occasional respites, and a nice one for the family
lies ahead on NBC Sunday night.
   It's ``Polly,'' an updated adaptation, with music and a black
cast, of ``Pollyanna,'' the 1960 Disney movie that was so goshdarn
positive it made the Up With People singers seem the Grumble
Chorale.
   This two-hour TV version, which dips into ``The Cosby Show''
cast for its button-cute star, Keshia Knight Pulliam as Polly, and
Phylicia Rashad as her stern spinster aunt, suffers from a similar
case of sugary.
   Still, it's oddly refreshing to see such unabashed innocence and
good will on prime-time TV, if only as an antidote to all the
``fact-based'' TV movies that air later and are mostly routine
salutes to grim.
   This ``Polly,'' written by William Blinn and directed and
choreographed by Debbie Allen, former colleagues in TV's ``Fame,''
is a gentle tale that through its young star slips in a plea for
racial harmony.
   Set in 1955, in times of racial segregation, it takes place in
the mythical, tidy, all-black Alabama town of Harrington, a hamlet
run and virtually owned by Polly's lovely, no-nonsense aunt.
   The aunt played by Rashad _ who in real life is Allen's sister _
believes that life is a very serious matter. Woe betide anyone,
even the town preacher (Larry Riley), heard making a joyful noise.
   All this starts changing when young Polly, left an orphan by a
car crash that killed her parents, arrives from Detroit to live
with her aunt, and quickly becomes best friends with a local orphan
boy (Brandon Adams).
   Young Polly is a small ray of sunshine whose faith in humanity,
regardless of race, is unshakeable. She brings out the good in
everyone.
   But of course that proves a turning point when she befriends a
rich, frowsy old white woman (Celeste Holm) who, as the Caucasian
counterpart of Polly's aunt, runs and virtually owns a nearby
all-white town.
   Such predictability can be overcome with a good script. Problem
is, Blinn, normally a fine writer, has sort of a tame teleplay here.
   Instead of showing the world through the child's shiny brown
eyes, the script is littered with distracting subplots, including
the love of a young music professor (Dorian Harewood) for Polly's
aunt.
   Worse, a supposedly mean old man (Brock Peters) the kids
encounter has a kindly twinkle in his eyes. A mean old man isn't
supposed to have such a twinkle, only a soul of garlic.
   A little more grittiness, less pasteurization, and more sharply
drawn characters would have greatly helped this show. But it's
enjoyable, anyway, for two reasons.
   One is the fine cast, most of whose members have stage
backgrounds. You only wish the script had offered them more.
   The other is the music, particularly Harold Wheeler's tasty
orchestrations of the gentle ballads or rollicking gospel songs.
With two first-rate dance numbers as part of the show, the tunes
help propel ``Polly.''
   They also make you wish this were a full-fledged musical, not a
story with music. It's a little frustrating. As in ``Tap,'' which
had the potential to be a great dance movie, most musical numbers
in ``Polly'' end too quickly and seem unwisely abbreviated.
   Oh, well. ``Polly'' is a good family show, and cheers to NBC for
commissioning it.
   A warning: shoo your tykes away when it ends. For all will
return to normal sweeps-month routine then, and NBC will air its
grim ``Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker.''
   It is a TV movie based on the true story of Richard Ramirez, the
satanic ``Night Stalker'' of Los Angeles who butchered or raped
more than a dozen people during a deadly spree in 1985.
   Ramirez, convicted of 13 murders, was sentenced to death on
Tuesday.

   THE GREAT AUDIENCE QUESTION _ For those who want to know if
ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' is going to dispense with its studio
audience, the answer from ABC News President Roone Arledge is
probably yes _ but not every week.
   He says the studio audience was made part of the program's
format ``because we were going to do a lot of Town Meeting-type
segments,'' but that hasn't often happened. Now, he says, ABC
executivies are pondering whether to have a studio audience only on
those weeks they feel the program needs it. ``We're in the process
of deciding that right now,'' he says.
   THE REAL AND THE RE-CREATED AT CBS NEWS: Thursday's scheduled
``48 Hours'' program on teen sex included excerpts of a girl
telling a Wisconsin hearing that she had an abortion without
parental consent. Tomorrow, ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung''
re-creates what a Massachusett teen-ager went through _ including
counseling and legal advice _ when seeking an abortion without her
parents' consent.

<HEAD>Weaker Corporate Profits Were No Surprise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You have to wonder about the stock market as an
economic forecaster if what they're saying is true: that the recent
market slump has its origins in corporate profit weakness.
   Why? Because the slowing in the growth rate of profits has been
going on for a long time, and with so pronounced a trend that no
informed investor could have been surprised. The red flags were
flying high.
   Even ordinary workaday consumers, those without any particular
knowledge or even interest in corporate profits, must have known,
because it was their stubborness that forced sellers to compete
with lower prices.
   In 1988, based on the Standard &amp; Poor's composite index,
corporate profits showed a 36 percent increase. In this year's
first quarter the rate was down to 22 percent, year over year. In
the second quarter it was under 10 percent.
   Aerospace, apparel, automotive, electrical, metal and oil and
gas companies have been strained. Record profits for the automotive
companies are a matter of history now. In electronics, Wang and
Control Data suffered sharp reversals.
   Theoretically, the stock market sees ahead at least six months,
but in this instance the professionals allegedly were surprised by
events that began at least six months ago and which are likely to
continue for months more.
   The economy is sluggish. Consumers are watching dollar and
credit balances. Reports show they are not losing their buying
confidence, but instead are sharpening their perspective on prices.
They are forcing price cuts.
   The signs are all about. Anheuser-Busch says it is ready to
match competitor discounts. Instead of almost constant sales, Sears
is promoting ``everyday low pricing.'' McDonald's and other
fast-food outlets are finding that customers sometimes prefer to
buy frozen foods and microwave them at home.
   Everyone is aware by now that the car companies are in a fix,
and are willing to talk deals. Knowing this, customers are driving
more hard bargains than new cars. And in some parts of the computer
market it's the same way.
   Such behavior is an extreme contrast to the inflationary
situation that existed through much of the 1970s, when customers
competed to buy and thereby forced up prices _ which in turn caused
other buyers to stampede before prices went even higher. In that
case, the consumer lost on every deal.
   In today's marketplace, competition is among sellers rather than
customers, and customers are winning on almost every deal.
   After one of the longest economic expansions ever, millions of
Americans have bought all the luxuries they need. Anything
additional is optional. If they see a bargain they might buy, but
they are ready to do without too.
   Meanwhile, many companies are involved in a marketplace brawl
that has little to do directly with consumers _ except to put them
in an even better bargaining position.
   Such companies are fighting to retain market position, the
better to greet the eventual upturn. They are reluctant to cut
production sharply; instead, they maintain high production and sell
at low or no profit.
   Holding market position can be extremely costly, of course, but
a lot of companies today are like breakfast cereal companies,
forced to hold onto their shelf position because if they don't they
might never get it back.
   Such a position is a rare one for the consumer because it has
the added benefit of forcing lower both inflation and interest
rates. And in the long run the harsh competition might be good for
producers too.
   In the meantime, however, it isn't very good for corporate
profits, and everyone seemed to have sensed it except the so-called
professional stock traders, who should have been watching that
signal most closely of all.

   In the home of producer Arthur Baker, near
Woodstock, N.Y., are crates containing more than 10,000 records. In
midtown Manhattan, the location of Baker's Shakedown Studio, nearly
as many musicians have passed through.
   Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Miles Davis and Paul McCartney are
but a few of the artists with whom Baker has worked, remixing songs
or producing albums.
   Rappers, rockers, crooners and funksters have all gotten a boost
from Baker's studio expertise and pounding drum sound that's best
described by the Hall and Oates album he produced, ``Big Bam Boom.''
   Disappearing behind the control board doesn't appeal to Baker.
Emotional, hard-headed and opinionated, he believes in the producer
as collaborator, even star.
   ``The producers who turned me on were (Kenny) Gamble and (Leon)
Huff, Thom Bell and all those Philadelphia guys,'' Baker said in a
recent interview at Shakedown.
   ``Norman Whitfield of Motown was a big influence. All those
producers made producer-oriented music. The producers would write
the songs, arrange them and do the whole thing. That's what I
aspire to be.''
   Baker has no catch phrase like Phil Spector's ``Wall of Sound''
or Motown's ``Sound of Young America.'' If anything, the producer
sees walls as something to be broken down, not constructed. That's
why he calls his new record ``Merge.''
   ``My album is representative of the music I like,'' Baker said.
``If you come out to my house and see my records, you know my
influences. This album is the merging of lots of different music.
   ``What I focused on was writing really good songs and making an
album that I found listenable and enjoyable. The next album I'd
like to combine some different elements and make new music.''
   Shirley Lewis, Tiny Valentine and John Warren are featured
singers. Al Green's soaring vocals carry the album's first single,
``The Message Is Love,'' but the song took months to record.
   ``We first did a reading and then he sang it through and it was
really good,'' Baker said. ``He said, `OK, Al Green ain't going to
sing it much better than that ...' But he didn't get the melody, he
rewrote it.
   ``He goes back and sings the medody but it's horrible. I ask
him, `Do you think we can get the other Al Green?' He sang it again
and it was great. Then I had to do some more over-dubbing. We ended
up doing two takes in Boston and four in Memphis.''
   Conflicts in the studio don't faze Baker, who has seen them from
all angles, settling creative differences and causing some, too.
Cocaine was a problem, he admits, and nearly ruined his career
after a run of hit records in the mid-1980s. He's counting on
``Merge'' to bring him back.
   ``The only way I cn do anything is to go in and write songs. I
had a bad reputation. People were saying I was difficult. But I
helped create things like multiple edits and songs without bass
lines. I think I can be innovative again.''
   Baker, a Boston native, made his breakthrough in 1981 with
Africa Bambaata's ``Planet Rock,'' an early rap record. He was soon
one of the industry's hottest producers and remixers, asked to edit
extended versions of songs from Springsteen's ``Born in the USA''
album. Dylan, McCartney and Hall and Oates also wanted his services.
   In 1985, he helped produce the ``Sun City'' record, assembling a
remarkable collection of musicians _ including Springsteen, Davis,
U2's Bono and Ruben Blades _ to perform material attacking South
Africa's apartheid system.
   In a studio crammed with stars, no one was revered more than the
reclusive Davis, who glided past an awestruck Bonnie Raitt and
contributed a horn part to a jazz track that appeared on the album.
   ``We asked Miles if it was OK to have a guy in the studio with a
video camera,'' Baker recalled. ``He starts playing and while he's
playing, he goes, `You can't come in here, you're the wrong color.'
I thought he was talking to the video guy, who's white.
   ``Then he says, `This ain't your country,' and we realized what
he was doing. We stopped and said that was great and asked if he
would mind doing something like that again.''
   But Baker also has unhappy memories of drunken sessions with
Dylan, feuds with Hall and Oates, and drawn out legal battles with
New Edition that he said contributed to his drug problems.
   Now, he's hoping to produce work that equals his best material
and will stick around as long as the blues records that fill his
home.

government's 3-year-old crackdown on insider trading.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Securities and Exchange Commission hallways
in Washington and 50th floor trading rooms above Wall Street, it is
remembered simply as Boesky Day.
   On Nov. 14, 1986, six months after arresting a pudgy investment
banker named Dennis Levine for insider trading, prosecutors
announced they had landed their biggest fish, Ivan F. Boesky.
   He stole $50 million through sleazy trades. He schemed to
conceal ownership of stocks and duped investors. He spun a web of
skulduggery that included junk-bond giant Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. and its master financier, Michael Milken.
   ``If my mistakes launch a process of re-examination of the rules
and practices of our financial marketplace, then perhaps some good
will result,'' Boesky said after paying $100 million in fines and
restitution and agreeing to plead guilty to one criminal charge.
   Ivan Boesky's wish has come true.
   In the three years since Boesky Day, Wall Street has drastically
changed the way it does business.
   The insider trading scandal has been a dominant theme in a
decade when investment firms grew fat on multibillion-dollar
takeover deals and rewarded baby-faced college graduates with
six-figure salaries.
   For some, fraud and greed were a byproduct of success. For the
Justice Department, prosecuting well-dressed criminals created a
battle subculture reminiscent of Eliot Ness vs. Al Capone in
Prohibition-era Chicago.
   Criminal and civil prosecutions unprecedented in the history of
the nation's financial markets snared violators from a 24-year-old
junior analyst to a 63-year-old magazine editor.
   Watching the scandal unfold was like watching a movie, and it
became the breeding ground for cinema, books and television.
   When police handcuffed a broker on a trading floor in the 1987
film ``Wall Street,'' it resembled a day in February 1987 when
prosecutors seized a veteran trader at venerable Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co. while disbelieving colleagues watched. The incident proved an
embarrassment for prosecutors, however, when they had to drop the
case against the trader for lack of evidence.
   The scandal also became the testing ground for aggressive use of
the criminal racketeering law dubbed RICO, previously reserved for
Mafia thugs and drug lords, to prosecute investment bankers in
Brooks Brothers suits.
   Prosecutors used the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law to force Drexel into a deal it couldn't refuse:
Plead guilty to securities felonies or face severe fines and a
potentially embarrassing trial.
   Perhaps most significant, the scandal forced Wall Street to
reassess and reform in a decade of unbridled paper wealth built on
a mix of youth, money, ambition and myopia.
   ``I was so focused on my career and getting ahead that I really
lost touch with reality, lost perspective,'' Levine, now 36, told
business students in New York this summer.
   Since Levine's arrest, more than 30 people and three companies
either have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a range of
financial crimes in cases brought by the Manhattan U.S. attorney.
   The crackdown led to a vastly expanded use of criminal
securities laws to include stock manipulation and disguising
securities ownership, behavior previously handled by the civil
courts.
   Milken, the Wharton MBA who pioneered Drexel's domination of
high-yield securities known as ``junk bonds,'' has been indicted
under RICO for dealings with Boesky.
   Prison terms have climbed, to four years for Florida takeover
specialist Paul Bilzerian, convicted in June. Boesky is up for
release in April from a three-year term at a minimum-security
prison in Lompoc, Calif. Levine was paroled in September 1988 after
serving 17 months of a two-year term.
   ``There's not a lot of sympathy for guys who make $500 million a
year cheating,'' said Harvey Pitt, a Washington securities lawyer
who represents Boesky. ``Judges have become a lot tougher.''
   Former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani orchestrated the
corruption crackdown and used it as a springboard for an
unsuccessful bid for New York City mayor. The securities unit of
the federal prosecutor's office has grown to 20 people from three
in 1986.
   ``They've overindicted and indicted for conduct which should not
be charged as criminal,'' said Stanley Arkin, a New York lawyer who
has defended several Wall Street figures targeted by Giuliani.
   ``I think when you rape, rob, pillage, extort, these things have
an inherent kind of evil to them _ far more than an inappropriate
tax straddle or a conflict between a lawful and an unlawful
rumor,'' Arkin said.
   On Wall Street, the insider trading scandal has changed the way
business is transacted. Arbitragers who speculate in stocks of
potential takeover targets and the investment bankers who finance
the deals say the days of careless information-swapping are gone.
   ``Bankers just won't pick up calls from arbitragers. They just
screen them out,'' said a 27-year-old investment banker at a major
Wall Street firm who spoke on condition he not be identified.
   Market participants say they have seen a decline in long runups
in the stock price of takeover targets before a deal is announced,
possibly indicating less information is leaked in advance.
   Investment firms have increased the number of compliance
officers monitoring trades and spent millions on new technology.
The New York Stock Exchange has boosted its market surveillance
staff to 109 from 85 in 1986.
   ``Taking the action against Boesky, taking the action against
Drexel has put the Street back on an even keel,'' said Gary Lynch,
the former SEC enforcement director who helped spearhead the major
insider trading cases and is now a private attorney in New York.
   Investment firms have hired lawyers who wield significant
policy-making power. Firms have rewritten rules and added ethics
lectures to training programs. Many brokerages now require
employees to clear personal stock transactions in advance to avoid
any possible suggestion of wrongdoing.
   For those on their way to Wall Street, top business schools
including Harvard have added required ethics courses.
   ``I certainly think it heightened the awareness of Wall Street
for the potential for disaster if business isn't being conducted in
the right way,'' said Joel Cohen, head of mergers and acquisitions
for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Kidder closed its arbitrage department after paying $25.3
million to settle civil insider trading charges stemming from the
Boesky scandal.
   ``There was an `it can't happpen here' attitude before that,''
said Kidder's general counsel, John Liftin. ``To find there was a
willful violator in the middle of things was a real shock to
everybody.''
   The scandal has produced drama ranging from courtroom face-offs
to an alleged plot to kill Boesky.
   When Milken pleaded innocent, hundreds of reporters and
spectators jammed Manhattan federal court. Drexel loyalists sported
hats reading ``Mike Milken We Believe in You'' and cheered their
hero.
   When speculator John Mulheren Jr. feared he was about to be
implicated, he loaded an assault rifle with the intent of shooting
Boesky, police said. He was seized en route. Mulheren since has
been indicted for securities fraud. He still faces weapons
possession charges.
   The highest drama, however, may be yet to come, a courtroom
confrontation featuring high-priced Milken attorney Arthur Liman
grilling Boesky on the witness stand at Milken's trial, set for
next year.

   The Virginia Legislature laid out a pitifully thin welcome mat
when Lawrence Douglas Wilder arrived at Richmond's Capitol Square
nearly 20 years ago. Even so, in the minds of some reluctant
colleagues that day, he promptly tripped over it.
   Wilder, then the only black elected to the state Senate since
Reconstruction, had barely taken his oath when he implored
replacement of the official state song, noting its lyrics extol
plantation life under ``old Massa'' and refer to the commonwealth
as ``where this old darkie's heart am longed to go.''
   ``The words burned in my ears,'' said Wilder. His words, in
turn, burned the ears of his white brethren. He was the only member
of the Senate who was not invited that year to the annual bash for
legislators at the exclusive Commonwealth Club, where he had once
worked as a busboy.
   Some things haven't changed in the Old Dominion in the two
decades since. ``Carry Me Back to Old Virginia'' is still the state
song, though rarely sung. But Doug Wilder won't find the footing
nearly so cruel in January when, barring an unexpected change in
last Tuesday's vote count, he will take his next oath at the state
capitol. The finest red carpet will be out for the new governor.
   Preliminary vote totals show that Wilder, a 58-year-old
Democrat, beat J. Marshall Coleman, a white Republican, by the
thread-thin margin of 5,000 votes.
   Coleman has said he will demand a recount. Assuming it confirms
Wilder as the winner, he will be the first elected black governor
in the history of the Republic.
   It would be naive to suggest that some people didn't vote for or
against Wilder on the basis of race. But the marvelous thing is
that no one in Virginia, a state ruled by segregationists a
generation ago, made race an issue in this campaign _ nasty as it
was on other fronts.
   Political analysts will have a field day postulating how
Virginia became the first state to elect a black governor _ not
California, where Tom Bradley came whisker-close in 1982, then
faded in 1986, and not Michigan, where Republican William Lucas
also lost in 1986.
   Pro-choice abortion activists, who campaigned hard for Wilder
with newfound voice and financial muscle, will trumpet his victory
as evidence of a shifting political tide. So will black activists
and national Democratic leaders still smarting from the Reagan and
Bush landslides.
   But any simplistic explanation simply will not do, for that
would ignore Wilder's ground-breaking achievements on a long,
patient climb to power over two decades _ not to mention the
remarkable social and political metamorphosis of the entire state.
   The Old Dominion, it is sometimes said, is now the New Dominion.
   Wilder has been a relentless, leave-nothing-to-chance
campaigner, and it could be argued that 1985, the year he won the
lieutenant governorship, marked his most important political
passage. White party leaders had pleaded with him to withdraw from
the race, lest he sink the ticket headed by Gerald Baliles, the
governor he now succeeds. Instead, Wilder began a 3,719-mile auto
tour of the state, handshaking his way through 338 cities and towns
and all 95 of the state's counties.
   Two-thirds of his $750,000 war chest that year was spent on
television ads, including one in which a beefy white policeman from
a small Virginia town delivered the endorsement of the Fraternal
Order of Police. Wilder won with 51.8 percent of the vote.
   He raised 10 times as much money for this year's governor's
race, which was a sweat-soaked reprise of 1985. He retraced his
path into virtually every country store, cafe and town hall. Some
advised him to stay out of remote, all-white regions. ``People said
I should never go out there with those people because I'd never be
seen again,'' he recalled. ``I go out there to those people, and
they say `Welcome home, Doug Wilder.'''
   In Farmville, Wilder renewed acquaintances with townspeople
beneath their monument to Confederate heroes and was led around by
Robert Bruce, a white attorney who has never lived anywhere else.
As Bruce put it: ``Folks are going to vote for him, but they aren't
going to talk about it. They aren't going to put a Wilder bumper
sticker on the truck.''
   That suited Wilder fine. His record is one of living within the
establishment while selectively challenging it, knowing when to
threaten, when to charm. He was never a street activist for civil
rights. He did not support Jesse Jackson's bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1984 or 1988, and spurned offers from
Jackson and other black activists to campaign for him.
   To those who think he has been too accommodating to the white
majority, he had a standard rejoinder: ``Jesse runs to inspire. I
run to win.''
   It may not have seemed that way in the beginning. He arrived at
the Legislature, already having risen from busboy to millionaire
criminal lawyer, wearing an Afro, and there was the early brouhaha
over the state song.
   Over time, the Afro gave way to a straighter silver mane, his
flamboyant attire to banker's suits. ``Someone said to me in 1985
that when he saw me wearing wingtips, he knew I was really
serious,'' he said.
   By then, Wilder was a committee chairman and one of the most
influential senators in the Legislature. He shepherded an array of
anti-discrimination laws and won a long battle to declare a holiday
honoring King _ although whites insisted that the day be shared
with Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.
   Wilder's rise, after all, took place in the city that once
served as the capital of the Confederacy, in a state that was
dominated for four decades by the segregationist political machine
of Harry F. Byrd Sr. A poll tax kept blacks effectively
disenfranchised until the mid-1960s, when the 24th Amendment to the
Constitution and the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 forced the
state to change.

   Yat-Pang Au enrolled at the University of
California at Berkeley this semester after a two-year battle
against a school admissions policy that he said discriminated
against Asian-Americans.
   His case has drawn new attention to affirmative action programs
designed to help minorities enter top colleges and universities _
because in some cases they have hampered rather than helped this
minority, which scholastically outperforms the general population.
   Au graduated at the top of his high school class and received
awards for 10 extracurricular activities. But his initial
application to Berkeley was rejected two years ago, his father
said, because of an affirmative action policy that put a 40 percent
limit on admissions based strictly on grades and test scores.
   In a single year, the number of Asian-Americans accepted as
freshmen at Berkeley dropped from 24 percent to 21 percent amid
cries of racism.
   ``I fight this not because it's my son but for Asian people as a
whole,'' said Au's father, Sik Kee Au, a businessman in San Jose,
Calif. ``One of the most important things in life for us is an
education.''
   The university has since revised its admissions policy, and the
younger Au enrolled there as a transfer student this semester as a
junior. His younger brother Yat Hon was admitted as a freshman.
   University officials say the new admissions policy maintains
high academic standards while reflecting the state's diverse
population, helping blacks, Hispanics and other low-achieving
groups. It has placated the once-angry Asian-American community,
but Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., wants more.
   Rohrabacher is sponsoring a resolution that would put Congress
on record as opposing quotas that appear to discriminate against
Asian-Americans.
   ``I believe that the issue here is not affirmative action but
one of equal opportunity for all students,'' said Rohrabacher in a
recent letter to the Asian Pacific Americans in Higher Education.
``Quotas and other forms of racial discrimination have no place in
our nation's schools and for that matter anywhere else.''
   University officials said the proposed resolution may hamper
efforts by colleges and universities to enroll more minorities.
   ``It would appear that Mr. Rohrabacher is using this resolution
as a way to get at affirmative action, which we obviously would
totally disagree with,'' said John Cummins, assistant chancellor
for public affairs.
   Most colleges and universities across the nation are seeking
ways to increase minority enrollment to prepare for demographic
projections that minorities collectively will become the majority
by the year 2000.
   Enrollment of minority undergraduate students this fall at
Bowling Green State University in Ohio increased 13.2 percent over
last year. Blacks account for 4 percent with 636, Hispanics make up
about 1 percent with 140, and other minorities, primarily Asians,
have gone from 96 to 118 of the 15,978 undergraduate students.
   At the University of Michigan, minority student enrollment
increased by 9.3 percent this year, from 4,991 to 5,454, a record
total. Officials said Asians comprise 6.8 percent of the student
body (after an Asian enrollment increase of 11.1 percent), blacks
6.5 percent, Hispanics 2.8 percent and American Indians 0.4 percent.
   The Chronicle of Higher Education said that in 1986, colleges
enrolled 90,000 American Indians, 448,000 Asians, 624,000
Hispanics, 1.1 million blacks, 9.9 million whites and 344,000
foreign students. The schools also have instituted special programs
to recruit and retain minorities.
   UC-Berkeley officials insist their new admissions policy merely
reflects the state's population, while upholding high academic
standards. The school receives about 22,000 applications for 4,000
spaces.
   Cummins said that since 1980, the state's population has
increased 500,000 a year and that between now and the year 2000,
there will be an additional 6 million residents, mostly minority _
Hispanic and Asians particularly.
   The Asian population has grown a phenomenal 70 percent since
1980 and now approaches 10 percent of the state's total.
   Statistics show that Asian-Americans at UC-Berkeley had the
highest graduation rates, nearly 95 percent in 1987, compared with
93 percent for whites. Other minorities, including blacks and
Hispanics, had graduation rates in the low- to mid-80s.
   By 1991, UC-Berkeley will admit 50 percent of its students based
on grades and test scores alone. Currently, 40 percent are in this
academic category.
   About 45 percent of the fall freshman admissions will be based
on criteria other than academic scores alone. The other criteria
will include race, disability and special talents, such as in
music, drama and debating.
   A third category will include athletes, the poor, regardless of
race or ethnicity, and older or re-entering students.
   Patrick Hayashi, who works with admissions at the university,
stressed that all applicants still fall within the top 12.5 percent
of high school seniors.
   ``Some people mistakenly think that our commitment to diversify
our student body has come at the expense of our academic standards.
That's simply false,'' said Hayashi. ``We are doing now exactly
what we've done for the past 50 years, selecting from the top.''
   The elder Au said that before the recent changes, ``it was very
clear'' UC-Berkeley ``had unfair practices for admissions.''
   ``But they are now gradually working to change that. I hope this
is the beginning of opportunity.''

<HEAD>Issues and Tactics of '89 Elections Could Spill Over Into 1990 Races</HEAD>

   Republicans already were having an off
off-year, and they knew there was worse coming.
   So they had an alibi ready when Democrats swept the season's big
three elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. The
outcomes ran to form, although the margins for a black governor in
Virginia and mayor-elect in the New York were narrower than the
pollsters anticipated.
   The Republican refrain was a tested and familiar one _ that
these losses were local, not portents of the national elections of
1990.
   But the hangover remedy didn't work this time.
   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater acknowledged as much,
even as he tried to play down the losses.
   These scattered elections had too much in common, in issues,
themes and tactics that could echo into next year's national
campaign for Congress and 36 governorships.
   Earlier in the year, Democrats had won five out of seven special
elections to the House; their majority will be 259 to 176 heading
into national mid-term elections in which the White House party
historically has lost seats in Congress.
   The 1990 elections also will shape the state governments that
will control the process of reapportioning congressional seats
after the census, another worrisome prospect for the GOP. It takes
a governor or control in at least one branch of the state
legislature to put a party in a bargaining position on
reapportionment. Republicans will control none of the above in the
two state governments shaped by Tuesday's balloting. Democratic
Govs.-elect James J. Florio of New Jersey and L. Douglas Wilder of
Virginia _ who still faces a recount _ will be working with solidly
Democratic legislatures.
   ``Take a look at what happened to underpin reapportionment for
1992,'' said Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
   Atwater said it would be a mistake to read national patterns
into local elections, but there were some:
   _The abortion issue boomeranged on Republicans, who once had
seen it work against Democratic candidates. President Bush, Atwater
and Republican congressional leaders discussed it at a Wednesday
political post mortem. Bush said in advance that he was not budging
in his own anti-abortion stance, enforced with two vetoes this fall.
   Atwater was quoted as saying that if abortion becomes the main
issue in the 1990 campaign, Republicans will lose.
   The Republican losers in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City
all were abortion foes, although each had tempered that opposition.
Wilder's campaign advertisements stressed the issue, saying he
would veto any attempt to take away a woman's right to choose. In
the closest of counts, that almost certainly gained him votes
crucial to his victory margin.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, said
extreme positions for or against abortion can only hurt candidates,
but that there is a common sense position in the middle.
   The Republican problem is that when their 1989 candidates tried
to move there, Democrats hammered successfully at their old,
absolutist positions, while anti-abortion groups denounced them for
trying to change.
   Democratic National Chairman Ronald H. Brown said Bush had dug
himself and his party into a hole on the issue.
   But the Democrats aren't home free, either. The official party
position is in favor of unrestricted abortion rights, but Brown
said that should not be a litmus test for their candidates. ``We
don't want to run Democrats away from the party because they won't
favor the platform line on this issue,'' he said.
   _Campaigns were tough, negative and sometimes personal, with
candidates and their advertisements concentrating on tearing down
the opposition. It is a proven tactic; President Bush used it in
1988.
   While Democratic leaders criticized that style of campaigning
and claimed the 1989 outcome would end it, Democratic winners used
it as aggressively as Republicans.
   ``Maybe I can have a role in seeing that it gets a little more
positive,'' Bush said Tuesday. How? ``Well, say I think it ought to
be a little more positive.''
   The argument now and probably next year is about who throws the
first stone, with each side blaming the other for negativism as
both sides go at it. While Brown said the voters are fed up with
negative politics he also said Democrats ``don't believe in
unilateral disarmament.''
   _Wilder became the first black elected governor, and David
Dinkins the first black mayor of New York, although by unexpectedly
narrow margins. Both ran as centrists; neither was vulnerable to
the tax-and-spend, soft-on-crime labels Republicans attached to the
Democratic ticket in 1988. Black Democrats were elected to succeed
white mayors in Cleveland, Seattle and New Haven, Conn. Even the
losing Republicans applauded the trend there and elsewhere;
Gingrich said the black victories were fundamentally good for
America.
   Atwater could point only to a handful of down-the-ballot
victories as evidence of success for black Republican candidates.
   And Eddie N. Williams, president of the Joint Center for
Political Studies, said Republicans still tend to send black
candidates on ``suicide missions,'' running them against heavily
favored Democratic officeholders. He said the Dinkins and Wilder
victories will help the Democrats attract black candidates and
solidify black support.
   There will be at least one major bid for another black
breakthrough next year.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young is preparing to run for governor of
Georgia in 1990. He'll seek the Democratic nomination on what is
likely to be a crowded ballot.
   If he won, two of 50 governors would be black. There are no
black senators, 24 House members.
   And Williams sees no prospect that those numbers will change
significantly next year. ``I don't know where there would be any
major advances in 1990.''

   Seven-year-old Justin Coles no longer cringes
when he goes to the doctor, and neither does his mother, thanks to
a program that provides free health care to children of the working
poor.
   Justin's parents earn $13,000 a year, too much to qualify for
state Medicaid yet well below the federal poverty level for a
family of five. Because the Coles fall through this ever-widening
crack, Justin receives treatment for recurring ear infections
through the Caring Program for Children.
   Before he was enrolled in 1986, ``We were relying on clinics. If
it would have been just your typical childhood illnesses I could
deal with that but with permanent hearing loss...'' said his
mother, Chris, her voice trailing off.
   ``He's very happy because he can see his doctor now. There was
that period of time when he was running from doctor to doctor and
clinic to clinic.
   ``The bottom line for him is it saved his hearing. I'm convinced
of this.''
   The program, sponsored by Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania and
Pennsylvania Blue Shield, has helped more than 13,000 youngsters in
four years. About 700 more are waiting to get in. Its success has
prompted nine states to start similar programs, and four more are
expected to follow suit soon.
   For Chris and Jim Coles, the Caring Program has removed the
stigma of being on welfare while letting them provide for their
son. His ID card resembles any insurance card, and is accepted by
most physicians.
   Mrs. Coles, 38, who has two children from a previous marriage,
works part time as a nurse's aide. Her husband, 37, a laid-off
steelworker, paints houses.
   ``We are the working poor. It's unfortunate, but we're not
alone,'' Mrs. Coles said. ``You have to make a choice. What's more
important to my child? His ears or having food on the table and a
roof over his head? That is absolutely what it came down to.''
   No one should have to make that kind of choice, said Fred
Rogers, host of public television's ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood''
and Caring Program honorary chairman. The program ``is not going to
solve all of the ills of our society, with its skyrocketing medical
expenses. But it certainly is a stopgap.''
   The Coles are among 37 million Americans the Census Bureau says
lack health insurance. About a third, or 12.5 million, are under
19. From 1980 to 1988, the number of children under 15 living in
poverty rose by 1.2 million, according to the Children's Defense
Fund.
   ``We have a national problem,'' said Dr. James Strain, executive
director of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
   ``The very poor people have access to care'' through the
government, Strain said. ``The children who have trouble are those
above the level that makes them eligible for Medicaid and children
who should be eligible but aren't.''
   The federal poverty level for a family of five, for example, is
$14,140 a year. Earning more than $7,700 disqualifies them for
Medicaid in Pennsylvania.
   ``You see why people go on welfare in this situation,'' said
Charlie LaVallee, director of the Caring Program. ``It's incredible
irony. People who are working, their children are worse off. That's
tragic in a land that has prided itself on the things we have
done.''
   The program was established in Pittsburgh in 1985 after two
ministers approached Eugene Barone, president of Blue Cross of
Western Pennsylvania, and described the anguish of unemployed
steelworkers. Barone discovered that 40,000 western Pennsylvania
children lacked health insurance, and that the problem spread far
beyond the families of former steelworkers.
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield agreed to match contributions dollar
for dollar, and to donate administrative costs, so children like
Justin could get not only treatment but regular checkups while
parents got back on their feet.
   Although the Caring Program doesn't cover specialized care for
chronically ill children and has no plans to do so, it hopes to
help them indirectly with a five-year, $341,000 grant awarded Oct.
30 by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the federal Office of
Maternal and Child Health.
   The money will be used to train doctors to treat such lifetime
ailments as diabetes or cystic fibrosis, said Dr. Woodie Kessel of
the federal office. And parents of chronically ill children will be
directed to service agencies and specialty clinics.
   The cost to the Caring Program of providing routine and
preventive treatment is $156 per child per year. Youngsters are
eligible as long as their families are above the Medicaid cutoff
but below the federal poverty level. The parents pay nothing to
participate in the program.
   The other states with Caring Programs are Alabama, Iowa, Kansas,
Maryland, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota and
Ohio. Four others plan to launch programs in January, but don't
want to be identified beforehand.
   ``It's not a quick fix and then get out,'' said Al Rohling,
executive director of the 1{-year-old Alabama Caring Program for
Children. About 3,000 children are waiting to get into the program,
almost as many as those currently in it; the state's eligible
population is estimated at more than 35,000.
   In central New York, 17,500 youngsters are eligible for the
Caring Program established Sept. 1. As of Nov. 1, 338 had been
approved for assistance.
   ``Are we going to wait until some federal program that may come
down a few years from now?'' asked Albert Antonini, president of
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Central New York Inc. ``The needs are
out there.''
   Acutely aware of those needs, the pediatrics academy is pushing
for federal health insurance for all Americans under 21 and for
pregnant women. Coverage would be furnished by parents' employers
or a state insurance fund.
   ``When we solve this problem, we can home in on the next group
that is really vulnerable,'' like senior citizens, LaVallee said.
``We have to keep attacking this with full strength.''

<HEAD>Cold Water Off Hawaii's Coast Turns Fish Farming High-Tech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) _ Hawaii conjures up images of
free-spending tourists lolling in the warm Pacific Ocean, but the
state hopes icy water pumped from the ocean depths will also boost
the islands' economy.
   ``Hawaii is in a unique position, because unlike the rest of the
coastal states, the ocean bottom drops sharply from shore,'' said
Kari Berg, manager of Hawaii Ocean and Science Technology Park on
the island of Hawaii. ``The water down there is free of germs and
real cold, so it can be used for everything from salmon farming to
cold storage.''
   The commercial HOST Park was dedicated in July and soon will
begin renting land, cold seawater and facilities to aquaculture
firms, several of which have done research next door at the Natural
Energy Laboratory of Hawaii.
   The 15-year-old laboratory is a pioneer in aquaculture. It draws
cold, germ-free water from a depth of 2,200 feet to grow everything
from strawberries to giant clams, and studies ocean thermal energy
conversion _ using temperature differences between surface and deep
water to generate electricity.
   The commercial park was a natural extension of the lab, and the
two will likely be merged by next year's Legislature, Berg said.
   Weather and geography combine perfectly at Keahole Point, on
Hawaii's western shore, for ``ocean farming on land,'' she said.
The bottom drops to depths of 15,000 feet, and pipes bring the
nutrient-rich sea water _ which is colder than 50 degrees _ inland,
where it is used in a warm, dry climate to nourish a variety of
crops.
   Phil and Joe Wilson, brothers who formed Aquaculture Enterprises
in 1986, fill their ponds or ``raceways'' with the water and grow
mature Maine lobsters in 2{ years, shaving 4{ years off the natural
maturation rate.
   ``It's not a crazy concept. You can raise lobsters in the
tropics as long as you have cold water,'' said Phil Wilson.
``Besides being cold, having water this clean takes a lot of risks
out of the operation.''
   Moreover, by moving away from the ocean, the Wilsons can control
other factors. ``Lobsters don't grow in the winter in the wild, but
in a controlled temperature they grow year-round. You don't have to
worry about predators ... and it's easier to control disease
because there's no pollution.''
   The brothers are in a demonstration phase now, but within three
years they hope to farm 20 acres and produce 500,000 ``Maine''
lobsters annually.
   Other companies cultivate abalone, salmon, lettuce, kelp and
microalgae for health food and pharmaceuticals.
   The commercial park has 547 acres, and the lab takes up 322
acres. Berg said leases for about half the available land are being
negotiated, but price is a barrier for many interested firms.
   Tenants spend $10,000 to $80,000 an acre to grade and develop
the rough volcanic terrain, and pay the state rent plus a
percentage of their profits. The state and county also stand to
profit from taxes and created jobs.
   ``Especially when they see the initial expense, it's hard to
convince a salmon fisher who has nets in the ocean that he'd be
better off with ponds on land, but he would be,'' Berg said. ``They
don't know the advantages _ such as year-round production _ until
they test it out. That's why we encourage them to start small at
the lab, which acts as an incubator.''
   The cold sea water and controlled environment are also ideal for
land crops, such as strawberries. In prototype strawberry fields,
cold sea water is pumped to the surface and through pipes in the
ground to cool soil surrounding the plants. That way, the
strawberries become dormant as they would in winter. When the cold
water stops running, the sun warms the fruit and it thrives. Drip
irrigation for the strawberries is provided by fresh water
condensation that forms around the pipes carrying the sea water.

<HEAD>Scientists Seek Chink in Bugs' Armor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Using modern-day nuclear magnetic resonance
imaging, Jacob Schaefer has found what may be a chink in
cockroaches' prehistoric armor.
   The ``cross-link'' is the place where chemicals are produced to
make the ultra-hard exoskeleton, said Schaefer, a Washington
University chemist. ``Once formed, these bonds are permanent and
very hard to break.
   ``My collaborators are now isolating the essential enzymes and
metabolites that help make the structure. Hopefully, they may be
able to develop an inhibitor molecule, one that thwarts the
enzyme's mode of action.''
   In other words, an insecticide that would kill the pests by
keeping them from developing the hard shell that holds them
together.
   That may be easier said than done.
   ``There may not even be a compound that will work,'' said team
member Karl J. Kramer, a Kansas State University chemist who works
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research
Service. ``Now that we know a little bit more about the structure,
maybe we'll have a little more luck, eventually.''
   In NMR, a sophisticated radio receiver-transmitter called a
spectrometer identifies atoms by their distinct response to a
magnetic field, so scientists can determine the makeup of a sample,
such as an insect's shell.
   ``It's now time for the organic chemists and the pesticide
chemists to look at that structure and come up with something that
can use it,'' said Kramer.
   A new approach to the problem has been called for by people
concerned over insects' ability to adapt to poisons and even
biological controls.
   ``The short-sighted and irresponsible use of pesticides and
antibiotics is producing strains of monster-bugs that are resistant
to our chemical weapons,'' said Robert L. Metcalf, professor
emeritus at the University of Illinois who is outspoken on the
subject of pesticide misuse.
   ``I doubt if we will ever be able to eradicate insect pests
entirely,'' he said. ``Insects in every case become resistant to
chemicals after a period of continued exposure, and they become
resistant to the biological controls. But we can improve our
methods of less toxic controls and it is clear we don't want to
keep relying on chemicals that are poisonous to both insects and
man.''
   Pesticides have found their way into groundwater and killed
fish, wildlife and people. The World Health Organization estimates
500,000 poisonings of humans and 20,000 deaths worldwide from
insecticide each year.
   Metcalf said Schaefer's pioneering use of NMR ``a unique
approach and an exciting contribution to the new-wave of
insecticide research.''
   Schaefer emphasized that much work needs to be done before his
findings can be of direct benefit. ``We hope to find that the
cross-link is different in each kind of insect. Any insecticide
will have to be selective.
   ``You don't want to kill every insect in the field _ some of
them are beneficial. But now, at least, scientists can make a
reasonable guess about what chemicals to look at.''
   One of the problems in the past, he said, is that there was not
enough communication between the disciplines in the scientific
community. Chemists, biologists and entomolgists tended to go their
separate ways.
   ``My whole strategy is to hook up with the best I can find in
every field. So far, we haven't worked with microbiologists doing
genetic engineering. But we're at least in the talking stage now.''

<HEAD>Music Volume `Comfort Level' Seems To Affect Driving Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   That rap or heavy metal music blaring from
teen-agers' car stereos may not be the distraction some people
think.
   People tend to react faster when music is at a personal
``comfort level,'' said Wichita State University psychologist
Marilyn Turner, who has tested about 100 people in a driving
simulator. Subjects were told to brake when a red bulb lit, with
music playing at different levels up to 80 decibels.
   An airplane landing nearby generates 120 or more decibels, rock
concerts generally produce 90 or more, and ear damage can occur at
95 decibels.
   ``In general, we found that people reacted fastest when there
wasn't any music at all,'' Ms. Turner said. ``And we expected as
the music got louder they would get slower in their reaction time.
What happened is that as they got to their preference level, they
actually got a little bit faster.''
   Gender difference also shows up in the tests, she said. Men have
the fastest reaction time when there isn't any music, and women
react fastest when the volume was right for them. Men tend to want
the volume higher than women.
   Turner plans to expand the study to see what effect volume has
on reaction time when people are trying to remember directions,
listening to music they prefer and listening to music they don't
like.
   When someone turns down the music to look for a street address
or in heavy traffic, she said, ``Really, all a person is doing is
saying, `Hey. All of a sudden my driving task isn't automatic any
more.'''

<HEAD>Scientist's `Pet' Microorganisms Eat Hazardous Waste</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLAQUEMINE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralph Portier calls them pets, but others
think his microorganisms may be an answer to hazardous waste
problems.
   ``The bugs feed upon phenol and other organic materials found in
nearly all carbon-based substances. ...These bugs eat and digest
bad materials and produce environmentally neutral byproducts,''
said Portier.
   The Louisiana State University researcher and three engineering
firms have cleaned up a hazardous waste pond and 30,000 cubic feet
of contaminated soil at Georgia Gulf's Plaquemine plant. ``The
water is impeccably clean, but the water was the least of the
problems. The big problem was the sludge and chemicals underneath
the water. That soil is now as safe as garden soil,'' he said.
   ``This is ... the first time we were able to use this natural
process to resolve a large-scale hazardous waste disposal
problem,'' said Vince Tretter, environmental manager at the plant.
   Portier's developments in adapting microorganisms to eat toxic
materials also is planned for a Superfund cleanup at the Old Inger
hazardous waste site near Darrow. It will be the first such use in
a Superfund site.
   ``Only about 60 percent of the sites can be approached from a
microbiology point of view, but the economics are quite attractive
when it can work. It cost about one-third to one-half the cost of
incineration,'' Portier said.
   The microorganisms could be used to clean up oil spills, too, he
said.
   ``Our imagination is the only limit to the future application of
this technology,'' said Peter Perez of Environmental Remediation
Inc., one of the firms involved in the cleanup. He believes
microorganisms will eventually be used to clean up a large
percentage of the nation's Superfund sites.

   Tests on the skin of a chameleon
heading for space on Wednesday could help scientists understand
more about cell structure and offer clues to down-to-earth human
problems like osteoporosis.
   ``In space, cells apparently make their normal products but
sometimes these products can't get out,'' said Roy Hammerstedt. He
hopes to learn if cells that secrete hormones malfunction in low
gravity because their structure is changed.
   The experiment will treat chameleon cells with hormones that
change skin color from green to brown or brown to green. If the
cells' structure changes in microgravity, one-thousandth normal,
the hormone won't trigger the change.
   ``Chameleon skin color change is hormonally dependant and
requires its own type of internal cell structure,'' said
Hammerstedt, a biochemist with Penn State University's NASA-funded
Center for Cell Research.
   ``We picked a skin model because it has many of the same
features as some of the more fragile cells we're interested in.''
   Researchers also believe a hormone imbalance causes
osteoporosis, muscle atrophy and other ailments, he said.
Astronauts have experienced bone and muscle problems that mimic
arthritis, osteoporosis and other diseases.
   Wesley Himer, a Penn State biochemist and director of the cell
research center, has found in experiments on U.S. and Soviet space
missions that growth hormone secretions in rats are reduced by half
in space. Experiments in space are useful because microgravity
speeds some cell processes, Hammerstedt said.
   His is one of 12 experiments to be launched Wednesday aboard a
Consort 2 rocket from White Sands, N.M. The seven- to eight-minute
journey will carry the 12-foot-long, 1,004-pound experiment module
to an altitude of 200 miles.
   Other experiments were submitted by Battelle Advanced Materials
Center in Columbus, Ohio; Kansas State University and the
University of Colorado-Boulder; Thiokol Corp.; Instrumentation
Technology Associates; the University of Alabama in Huntsville;
McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co.; and Phillips Petroleum Co.
   Consort 2 is the second launch from White Sands devoted to
experiments. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has
funds for another this fiscal year. Consort 1 flew March 29 with
six materials science experiments.

   The Senate has given final passage to
legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25 by April
1991, the first increase in the floor wage since 1981. President
Bush is expected to sign the bill next week.
   The 89-8 Senate vote Wednesday came eight days after Bush and
congressional Democrats agreed on the plan to boost the minimum
wage by 45 cents next April 1 and another 45 cents a year later.
   The measure, passed overwhelmingly by the House last week, also

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. is giving
Micron Technology Inc. a license to make the latest generation of
computer memory chips, a boon to Micron and to buyers who want
American-made chips.
   In its announcement Wednesday, IBM said it is continuing to
discuss a similar licensing arrangement with U.S. Memories Inc.,
the consortium launched in June to rebuild the American share of
the world memory chip market.
   IBM was the world's first company to announce volume production
of the 4 million-bit dynamic random access memory chip, known as
the 4-megabit DRAM.
   The deal helps Micron, a Boise, Idaho-based company that might
not have been able to come up with the design and process
technology for the new generation of chips by itself.
   It also benefits computer users by ensuring that there will be
another American supplier of the chips. IBM is the world's largest
maker of chips but uses its entire production internally. It also
buys chips from outside suppliers, including Micron.
   ``This agreement shows IBM's dedication to preserving American
supplies of vital semiconductor components,'' Joe Parkinson,
Micron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
   The only U.S. companies besides Micron that sell DRAMs on the
open market are Texas Instruments Inc., which has a
research-sharing agreement in DRAMs with Japan's Hitachi Ltd., and
Motorola Inc., which is closely allied in DRAMs with Japan's
Toshiba Corp.

   Tabacalera SA, which administers Spain's tobacco monopoly, will
buy RJR Nabisco's 50.5 percent interest in three Spanish food
companies: Galletas Artiach SA; Marbu SA; and Nabisco Brands Espana
SA.
   Tabacalera already had owned the portion of the three businesses
that RJR Nabisco didn't own. In 1987, Tabacalera bought a 49.5
percent stake in the food companies.
   Also under the agreement, Tabacalera will buy Nabisco's wholly
owned Nabisco Brands Portugal Comercio E Industria LTDA and certain
trademark rights in Spain and Portugal.
   The companies sold to Tabacalera market a range of food
products, such as biscuits, baking powder, flour, puddings and cake
mixes.
   RJR Nabisco began its asset sales earlier this year after
Kohlberg Kravis completed its acquisition of the food and tobacco
giant.
   Kohlberg Kravis agreed to sell $5.5 billion in assets in return
for financing the deal, which was the most expensive takeover in
history.
   Most recently, RJR Nabisco announced the sale of its Baby Ruth,
Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle Foods Corp. for
$370 million.
   Previously, RJR Nabisco sold: five European food businesses for
$2.5 billion; Del Monte's canned food business for $1.48 billion;
Del Monte fresh fruit operations for $875 million; its Chun King
division for $52 million; its Associated Biscuits International
Ltd. for $44 million; and Nabisco's biscuit business in Scandinavia

   The company that is introducing facsimile machines
to the nation's post offices was born out of frustration.
   It was 1985 and Edd Helms was in Atlanta trying to rework a bid
proposal due the next morning from his Miami-based electrical
contracting firm.
   Late at night, Helms asked the hotel desk for its fax number so
he could receive documents from his main office.
   ``They said, `What's a fax?''' said Helms. ``I was stunned. I
thought they were kidding.''
   Helms' company lost the bid, but the incident sparked the idea
for Hotelecopy Inc., which has installed fax machines in more than
1,700 hotels nationwide.
   On Monday, Hotelecopy moved into a new arena as the U.S. Postal
Service's first customer fax machine opened in New York City under
a one-year program that will bring the devices to about 8,000 post
offices nationwide.
   ``The fax machine is what the personal computer or automatic
bank tellers once was,'' said the Hotelecopy president. ``It will
become so integrated into American life that we will wonder how we
got along without it. The post office has recognized that.''
   Hotelecopy, which has contracted with MCI Communications Corp.
for telephone connections to the machines, will install the credit
card-operated fax machines in 54 post offices in the Northeast. It
also plans to submit bids later this month to provide service for
the remaining regions of the country.
   Customers will be charged $12.75 for three minutes of
transmission, which is equivalent to about seven pages.
   Hotelecopy will pay the Postal Service $150 a month rent for
each location and an undisclosed percentage of revenue.
   Hotelecopy, which made its first public stock offering in
September, had revenue of about $5 million last year.
   Even before Hotelecopy was founded, Helms, 43, said he was
extolling the virtues of the fax.
   By the early 1980s, Helms said he decided to place purchase
orders for his contracting company exclusively by fax. He then gave
his suppliers three options: buy a fax, lease one from Helms or
lose his business.
   Today, the Hotelecopy fax network moves about 50,000 pages a
day. Helms recently expanded the service to include translation
services and secretarial work.
   ``A businessperson faxes down a document to us in Miami and we
send back the translation,'' said Helms.
   Hoteleticket Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, has also placed
airline ticket machines in about 50 hotels, from luxury resorts to
chain establishments. The units can print a ticket and boarding
pass within 10 minutes of order, said Helms.
   ``There is a whole new definition of what fast is and what good
service is,'' said Helms. ``People today want things immediately
and they don't what to go out of their way to get it. Time is too
precious.''
   Helms estimates fax machines are used in about 25 percent of
U.S. businesses but fewer than 1 percent of homes.
   ``Think of the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker. You
think they have a fax? But soon they may not be able to do without
access to one,'' said Helms. ``That's the void the post office will
fill. The fax-less will no longer have to do without.''

<HEAD>Ad Club Picks Federal Express ``Fast-Talker'' Ad As Best of '80s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Federal Express Co. commercial that featured
an incredibly fast-talking businessman was the best advertisement
of the 1980s, according to a survey of the board of the ad trade
group The One Club.
   The Orwellian ``1984'' commercial for Apple Computer Inc. and a
series of Rolling Stone magazine print ads noting the differences
between some perceptions about its readers and reality also were
ranked among the best ads of the decade, the group said Wednesday.
   Ads for Levi Strauss' jeans, Nike shoes, the wine coolers
Bartles &amp; Jaymes and California Cooler and Miller Lite beer also
made the list.
   The One Club, an association of advertising copywriters and art
directors, developed its ranking based on responses to surveys in
which each of its 13 directors was asked to rank personal favorites
from the past decade.
   None of the directors' ad agencies placed an ad on the decade's
best list.
   Of the 12 best ads, 10 involved television commercials, one was
a print campaign and one used billboards.
   Mike Hughes, vice chairman and creative director of The Martin
Agency of Richmond, Va., said the directors generally were trying
to identify ads that broke from convention and spawned imitators of
their own.
   But he said 1985 commercials for Levi's 501 jeans, which showed
young people in urban settings cast in a blue-shaded hue, had a
style copied widely. ``A lot of commercials became blue,'' he said.
   Hughes said the top-rated ``Fast Talker'' ad from Federal
Express in 1982 brought activity to a halt in many households each
time the commercial aired.
   A separate Federal Express campaign from 1980 that showed top
executives anxious to get a package delivered picking up the phone
and saying ``Hello-o-o Federal'' broke the ad taboo of ``Never make
the customer look silly,'' Hughes said.
   Apple's ``1984'' ad showed a dreary scene of prisoners filing in
for a televised address by a dogmatic leader. The gloom was
shattered when a woman tossed a club that broke the screen. The ad
ran only once _ during the telecast of the 1984 Superbowl football
game _ but Hughes said no other ad has had more impact on one
airing.
   Authorship of a memorable ad in the 1980s did not necessarily
mean an ad agency kept the assignment. Ally &amp; Gargano, which made
the two winning Federal Express ads, is no longer the Federal
Express agency, and Apple has dropped Chiat-Day, which made
``1984,'' as its agency.
   But Chiat-Day offices, now known as Chiat-Day-Mojo, were
responsible for five of the 12 best ads, according to the One Club
survey.

<HEAD>Whittle Considers High-Tech TV Network for Doctors' Waiting Rooms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The media concern Whittle Communications thinks
it's not enough to have taken over the magazine racks in doctors
offices with its series of magazines. Now it wants to get patients
to watch its TV programs as they wait for their appointment.
   Whittle said Wednesday it is developing a closed-circuit,
advertiser-supported television network for installation in 100,000
medical waiting rooms nationwide.
   The company disclosed it was developing the new TV project on
the same day it launched the first in a series of non-fiction books
that contain advertising and are being given for free to 150,000
civic and business leaders.
   Whittle executives hope to decide by year's end whether to
proceed with a large-scale test of the new TV project, which they
said could be the company's largest to date and one of the biggest
in broadcasting, with a potential audience of 30 million a week.
   The Knoxville, Tenn.-based company, which is 50 percent owned by
Time Warner Inc., is already in 60,000 doctor's offices with either
its Special Reports magazines or sponsored posters.
   The TV project has the potential to generate more annual revenue
than the $90 million expected from Whittle's other television
project, the Channel One daily news show for teens that Whittle
plans to launch in March in 1,000 middle and high schools, Whittle
executives said.
   Alan Greenberg, vice chairman of Whittle and the executive in
charge of the new TV project, said the system would deliver
programming live by satellite to doctors' waiting rooms. The rooms
would be equipped with advanced viewing systems _ possibly
high-definition TV sets, multi-screen sets or wide-screen TV.
   ``We want to offer something as different from existing TV
technology as color was from black-and-white,'' he said.
   He said it has not been determined what kind of programming
would be carried on the system, but said that possibilities under
study include a health-related program or an entertainment program.
   Whittle would produce the program, which may last an hour or so,
and the show would be repeated continuously during the day, he
said. A new show could be produced every week or two, he said.
   The project could involve more than $250 million in technology
alone, well above the $150 million being spent on Channel One.
   Greenberg said the TV project is a logical extension of
Whittle's involvement with publications targeted to people in
medical waiting rooms.
   Special Reports, a series of six quarterly publications, are
read by about 60 percent of the people visiting the 17,000 doctors'
waiting rooms where the magazines are available, he said.
   The audience is predominantly women with children, an appealing
target for many advertisers that is often hard to reach in large
numbers with other media.
   He said Whittle has received ``very positive vibes'' from the
medical community about its plans for a TV network.
   If the TV project is launched, Greenberg said, advertisers would
probably be given the chance to buy packages that would include ads
in the magazines and on the TV network with the guarantee that
competing brands would not appear.
   He said it had not yet been determined how much advertising time
would be sold on each program, but said it would probably be less
than the 16 minutes of network and local advertising carried each
hour on broadcast television.
   Whittle plans to decide in late December whether to undertake a
large-scale test of the system, Greenberg said. The test could
begin in mid-1990, he said, and if that proves successful, the
project could be launched nationally the following summer.
   The main stumbling blocks, he said, are assurances that the
programming can be delivered on time and the cost of technology.
   The first book in what Whittle is calling The Larger Agenda
series is ``The Trouble with Money'' by William Greider, who wrote
``The Secrets of the Temple,'' which explored the Federal Reserve
System.
   The books in the series are slimmer than most regular books so
that harried opinion-makers will read them, said Whittle editor
William S. Rukeyser.
   Greider's book runs 96 pages with 18 pages of advertising, all
of it from Federal Express Co., the air courier based in Memphis,
Tenn.
   Federal Express also is shipping the books for free to 150,000
government and business leaders over the next few days.
   In addition, the book will be available without advertising for
$11.95 in 150 selected Waldenbooks stores later this month.
   Rukeyser said Whittle hopes to publish one new book in the
series every two months.

<HEAD>Fed Lowers Key Interest Rate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve, after weeks of complaints
from the Bush administration about high interest rates, has nudged
a key interest rate lower in a move analysts predicted would
trigger widespread declines in a variety of consumer and business
borrowing rates.
   Economists were looking for commerical banks to cut by one-half
percentage point their prime lending rate, which is used as a base
to calculate more than one-third of their business and consumer
loans.
   One bank, Southwest Bank of St. Louis, said Wednesday that it
was cutting its prime lending rate from 10.5 percent to 10 percent.
While the move was not immediately followed by the country's
largest banks, analysts predicted that it would be, perhaps later
this week.
   Many economists predicted that the easier Fed monetary policy
would accelerate a move to lower mortgage rates.
   Wall Street was buoyed by the Fed's actions with stock prices up
sharply on investor optimism that the central bank was moving to
keep the economy from slipping into a recession. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks closed with a gain of 26.23 points
at 2,623.36.
   As usual, the Fed made no announcement of its decision to move
toward an easier monetary policy.
   However, analysts said there was little doubt that such a
decision had been made, given the fact that a bellwether interest
rate, the federal funds rate, traded again Wednesday at 8.5
percent, down from 8.75 percent when the week began.
   The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each
other to make overnight loans. Because it is directly influenced by
the Fed's decisions on the amount of cash to make available to the
banking system, it considered the best gauge of Fed policy
intentions.
   ``It is clear that the Fed has eased,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co. ``The central bank is acting to prevent
the economy from heading into a serious downturn.''
   Federal Reserve officials refused comment on a report in
Wednesday's Washington Post that the decision to ease was made
during a telephone conference call Monday among members of the
Federal Open Market Committee, composed of Fed board members in
Washington and presidents of five of the 12 regional Federal
Reserve banks.
   The FOMC, which gathers in Washington eight times a year to map
monetary strategy, will meet Tuesday and some economists expressed
surprise that the Fed took action this week instead of waiting for
the regularly scheduled meeting.
   The quarter-point drop in the federal funds rate this week is
the fifth small decline that has occurred since late May when the
central bank began to reverse a year-long effort to drive interest
rates higher as a way to fight inflationary pressures.
   President Bush and others in the administration have been
complaining that the central bank has been moving too slowly to
lower interest rates. White House Budget Director Richard Darman
warned in August that if the economy does slip into a recession, it
will be the fault of the Fed's tight-money policies.
   Some economists, however, said Wednesday that the Fed was wrong
to buckle to political pressure, warning that the action could make
inflationary pressures worse in 1990.
   ``I am very disappointed in the Fed and very pessimisitc about
the chances of keeping inflation down,'' said Cynthia Latta, an
economist with DRI-McGraw Hill. ``They may be thinking that they
can loosen, rescue the economy and then tighten again, but
experience has shown that doesn't usually work.''
   Other economists were not as pessimistic, saying that if the Fed
had waited to ease until it got inflation down further, it would
have run an even greater risk of dumping the economy into a
downturn.
   ``Central banks in the past have made big errors in fighting
inflation for too long and then watching as the economy tumbles
into a widespread, broad recession,'' Sinai said. ``That just
intensified the downturn and forced the central bank to pump up the
economy with easy money, creating a bust-boom situation.''
   Various analysts said they believed that a hallmark of the Fed
under Chairman Alan Greenspan has been a gradual approach to either
tightening or loosening monetary policy and for that reason they
said that the 0.25 percent drop in the federal funds rate would not
be followed quickly by further decreases.
   But even the modest reduction will be enough to prompt
reductions in the prime rate and other business and consumer
borrowing rates, economists predicted.
   Mortgage rates have already dropped into single digits with
fixed-rate mortgages averaging 9.82 percent last week, according to
a survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Some economists forecast that rates could drop by another
one-half percentage point by the end of the year in response to the
Fed's easier credit moves.

<HEAD>Guidelines Unveiled For Punishing Corporate Wrongdoers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Sentencing Commission has unveiled
draft guidelines for punishing corporate wrongdoers that would
dramatically increase fines for companies convicted of federal
crimes.
   The draft guidelines, published Wednesday in the Federal
Register, contain elaborate formulas for calculating the fines that
companies would be required to pay for a variety of federal crimes.
   Only 350 companies, mostly small, are convicted of federal
crimes each year.
   But in recent years large frauds committed by big corporations
have increased the average fine paid by companies from $48,000
between 1984 and 1987 to $195,000 last year, according to studies
performed by the commission.
   ``There is no question this is a dramatic increase in criminal
fines,'' said Mark Cohen, an assistant professor of management at
Vanderbilt University and former staff member of the sentencing
commission who studied corporate fines.
   Cohen said his study of fines ``suggests that currently if you
impose a $1 harm you'll pay 20 cents to a dollar in criminal
fines.''
   ``But under these guidelines, it looks like the criminal penalty
will be between two and three times the harm. That could be as much
as a tenfold increase over current practice.''
   The commision said in a draft policy statement that ``punishment
of a convicted organization will provide a strong incentive for
owners and managers of organizations to strengthen internal
mechanisms for preventing officers and employees from committing
crimes and for detecting and punishing such crimes that are
committed.''
   The proposed guidelines, which contain two basic options for
calculating fines, will be open for public comment until Feb. 15.
The commission, which was created by Congress in 1987, will submit
final guidelines to lawmakers on May 1, 1990.
   The guidelines would become law unless Congress enacts
legislation overturning or altering them.
   The new guidelines contain a number of factors that must be
taken into account when calculating how much money a company would
be fined.
   Aggravating factors include whether top executives aided or
condoned the crimes or whether these officials tried to block a
government investigation.
   An offense that ``presented a substantial risk to the continued
existence of a financial or consumer market'' would also expose a
company to additional fines.
   Fines would be reduced for mitigating factors such as a
reasonable lack of knowledge of the crimes by high-level executives.
   In the case of companies found to be created solely to perform
criminal activity, the fine should be large enough to divest the
firm of its assets, according to the proposal.
   Two years ago, the sentencing guidelines for individual
defendants took effect. They require courts to calculate the
sentences according to elaborate formulas taking into account
criminal history and the circumstances of the crime.

<HEAD>S&amp;Ls With Insufficient Capital Must Report To Government By Mid-January</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-S&amp;L Convention, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Savings and loan institutions with
insufficient capital must advise the government by mid-January how
they plan to meet tough new money requirements or face operating
restrictions, the government said.
   The new capital standards were announced Monday by the Office of
Thrift Supervision, created by the savings and loan bailout law
passed by Congress last summer. The agency announced guidelines
Wednesday for thrifts unable to meet the standards.
   ``Those institutions that will fall below the new standards on
Dec. 7 must submit an acceptable capital plan to raise their
capital levels or be subjected to operating restrictions including
growth and capital distribution limitations and regulatory
approvals of changes in management and the board of directors,''
the OTS said.
   It said the plan must be submitted to the OTS district director
within 60 days of Nov. 7, the day the standards became effective.
Institutions that subsequently fail to meet the requirements will
have 60 days after falling out of compliance to file plans.
   The plans must show what actions the institutions will take to
meet the new standards no later than Dec. 31, 1994.
   The OTS has said that as many as 800 thrifts with assets
totaling $600 billion would not be able to meet the standards,
which are intended to provide a bigger cushion of capital to absorb
losses before an institution fails and its deposits become eligible
for federal insurance coverage.
   Anticipating the new standards, many thrifts have been selling
assets and reducing their size recently.
   Thrifts may apply for exemptions from capital directives or from
specific sanctions or penalties imposed for failing to meet their
capital standards, the guidelines said. Such requests must be
accompanied by acceptable capital plans demonstrating that the
standards can be met.
   In addition, the plans must:
   _Demonstrate that the thrift's increases in capital will meet or
exceed interim targets for capital levels and can be measured on a
quarterly basis.
   _Set forth the manner and timing in which capital increases will
be achieved.

<TEXT>
   Here are key provisions of the legislation to
increase the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour while creating a new
subminimum wage for certain teen-age workers. The bill becomes
effective next April 1.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE RATE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The minimum wage, $3.35 an hour since January 1981, would
increase to $3.80 on April 1, 1990 and to $4.25 on April 1, 1991.
The Labor Department last year estimated that nearly 4 million
Americans worked at the minimum wage.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE SUBMINIMUM</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Workers 16-19 may be paid the subminimum for their first three
months in the work force, and for an additional three months if
receiving formal training. No one over 20 or with six months total
job experience may be paid the subminimum. The subminimum will be
$3.35 an hour when the minimum wage rises to $3.80. It will be
$3.61 an hour when the minimum wage reaches $4.25. Migrant seasonal
farmworkers are exempt from the subminimum and the entire
subminimum provision expires in April 1993.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TIP CREDIT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Employers may now pay workers who receive tips 40 percent of the
minimum wage provided the tips bring the hourly pay at least to the
minimum. That will be 45 percent on April 1 and 50 percent a year
later.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Small businesses with gross sales of $362,500 currently are
exempt from the federal minimum wage law, although all but eight
states have their own minimum wage laws and their exemptions vary.
The federal exemption would expand to $500,000.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>OTHER EXEMPTIONS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The bill continues the more than four pages of hundreds of
special exemptions already in the law. Examples are some farm
workers, including tobacco leaf harvesters, casual babysitters,
newspaper delivery workers, amusement park employees, wreath
makers, employees at small radio stations in cities with a
population below 25,000 and mollusk and crustacean harvesters.

   Nissan Motor Corp.'s ads for its new
Infiniti models will retain their focus on fuzzy images of nature,
such as ponds of pensive trout and gentle cloudbursts, rather than
the high-performance luxury cars.
   ``There are more rocks and pussywillows to come,'' William
Bruce, Nissan's general manager for the Infiniti line, said at a
ceremony Wednesday marking the day the Japanese cars officially
went on sale.
   Infiniti has two models, the Q45 full-size four-door sedan, with
a base price of $38,000, and the M30 sports coupe at $23,500 _
expensive but less costly than European luxury cars.
   Nissan officials such as Bruce believe the cars are so good that
they, along with Toyota Motor Corp.'s new Lexus luxury line, will
force other prestige automakers to offer incentives to buyers or
cut prices, as BMW and Jaguar already have done.
   But Infiniti's ads have avoided direct shots of the cars.
Instead, they soft-focus on falling rain, birds in flight, crashing
waves, hay fields and rock outcroppings, giving just a passing
glimpse of the cars.
   A meditative text accompanies the moody images. The idea is to
pique buyers' interest and get them into showrooms.
   Enough already, many observers say.
   ``What they've clearly been trying to do is develop an
anticipation for the vehicle itself, and they're creating a mystery
about it,'' said Arvid Jouppi, an auto analyst with Keane
Securities in Chicago.
   But he said that now that the car is on sale, ``Sooner or later
they've got to bring it out in the ads.
   ``You may talk to the girl on the phone, but you don't propose
to her that way. Some things you need to do face to face,'' Jouppi
said.
   Ronald Glantz, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco, said anyone prepared to pay for a luxury car will take
the time to compare the Infiniti to the Lexus and other cars
regardless of what ads are like.
   ``I'm not enough of an (advertising) expert to say whether this
feel-good advertising will work,'' Glantz said. ``But this is not
like getting Joe Sixpack to stir from his television. The guy who
is going to spend $40,000 is going to check it out.''
   Lexus, whose models list for $2,000 to $3,000 less than
Infiniti's, was introduced Sept. 1. Through Oct. 31 its dealers
sold just under 8,000 cars, about what Lexus predicted.
   Infiniti officials have avoided sales projections, however, and
there are just 50 Infiniti dealers in 30 markets in the country.
Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia are among the areas without
dealers.
   Bruce said the company had been extremely selective,
intentionally starting slowly to ensure quality service and
workmanship. But he predicted Infiniti would have 100 dealers
within a year and up to 165 in five years.
   As for when TV watchers will get more than just a glance of the
cars, he said surveys of car buyers and dealers would be the
determining factor.
   ``We'll let the market reaction tell us what to do. Let's watch
the next three or four months and see how the market reacts, and
we'll go from there.''

   Major airlines officials are raising strong
objections to congressional moves to reimpose government control
over their industry.
   A Senate subcommittee heard testimony Wednesday on legislation
that would alter several practices sponsors say have driven small
airlines out of business and kept others from starting up.
   Calling for even stronger action, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, introduced the Airline Reregulation Act that would allow
the government once again to regulate fares, routes, and services.
The industry was deregulated by Congress in 1978.
   ``I don't know if complete reregulation is the answer,''
Metzenbaum said. ``But I do know it's time we owned up to the fact
that airline deregulation was a mistake.''
   Metzenbaum appeared as a witness before the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation's aviation subcommittee, which was
discussing an airline competition bill opponents said also would
bring regulation back.
   That legislation, sponsored by Sens. John Danforth, R-Mo., and
John McCain, R-Ariz., would force big airlines to give up their
computerized reservations systems, stop them from booking flights
on smaller airlines as if they are their own, end the selling of
slots at major airports and strengthen the government's ability to
increase competition.
   ``Instead of a proliferation of choices, consumers are
increasingly faced with little or no choice'' in airline service,
McCain said.
   Robert L. Crandall, head of American Airlines, told the
committee the proposals would ``diminish, not enhance,
competition.''
   He acknowledged that computer reservations systems give airlines
who own them a competitive advantage, but he denied this was
because of anything mechanically built into the systems, which are
provided to travel agents for booking flights.
   ``Why should we be deprived of an advantage we have earned?''
Crandall asked.
   He said the government should concentrate on building more
airports and other facilities to increase competition instead of
restricting successful airlines.
   ``The message I hear is that we are free to be innovative, free
to risk capital, free to compete, as long as we lose money,''
Crandall told the committee. ``If we are successful, the rug is
likely to be pulled out from under us.''
   James W. Callison, a senior vice president of Delta Air Lines,
said forced divestiture of reservations systems would produce
increased air fares.
   Callison said a provision of the bill that would prevent
airlines from linking up with small commuter airlines would punish
airlines that have not taken over smaller carriers.
   ``Delta's connection carriers operate as independent companies,
not owned by Delta, and are major examples of small business at its
best,'' he said.
   Edward R. Beauvais, chief executive of the small America West
Airlines, indicated general support for the bill and suggested it
also call for an Internal Revenue Service investigation of frequent
flyer programs.
   ``These programs, although quite popular, are among the most
antithetical to the spirit and goals of airline deregulation,''
Beauvais said.
   He noted businesses often pay for the tickets, but employees can
use the frequent flyer tickets without being taxed for the benefit.
   ``The programs do not promote new business, they simply allow
airlines to charge higher prices for the business that they are
already receiving,'' Beauvais said. Most U.S. airlines, including
America West, award flights and other benefits for customers who
regularly fly with them.
   Beauvais also proposed that airlines be prohibited from paying
extra commissions to travel agents who book a high number of
passengers on carriers whose reservations systems they are using.

   Under the growing threat of an outside takeover,
United Airlines pilots are again talking with management and
possible investors about an employee buyout of the company.
   Directors of United's parent company, UAL Corp., have given
Chairman Stephen Wolf the go-ahead to explore a deal, Hank
Krakowski, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, said
Wednesday.
   The pilots in October spearheaded an attempted employee buyout
of the airline company, but the bid failed for lack of financing.
   Krakowski said the pilots have met with management, and the
union is ``continuing to explore any and all options in its effort
to gain employee control of the airline.''
   ``All I can say is the pilots are seeking employee ownership
with the current management team,'' Krakowski said. He did not,
however, exclude an effort with other parties.
   Investor Saul Steinberg, who was a passive investor in UAL and
recently sold a sizable stake, met with pilot representatives
Tuesday and indicated he might participate in a bid ``under the
right circumstances,'' the Chicago Tribune quoted an anonymous
source as saying.
   Steinberg last week sought government clearance to acquire more
than a 15 percent stake in the company.
   Gus Oliver of Coniston Partners said he is aware that UAL
directors have given Wolf the go-ahead to explore buyout
possibilities, but it doesn't change his goals.
   He said: ``... There has been no change in our plans'' to gain
control of UAL. We've been talking to all interested parties and
will continue to do so.''
   Coniston, a New York investment group, met Wednesday with
representatives of United's Machinist union.
   The meeting in Washington was to hear what the group was
planning for UAL, said spokesman Jim Conley of the Machinists,
United's largest union representing 25,000 of its 70,000 workers.

   Directors of UAL issued a statement last month indicating the
board would not consider any offer under $300 a share _ the
per-share price that failed in October.
   UAL stock gained $5.25 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange
trading Wednesday to $185 a share.

<HEAD>Turner, Others Turning Yellow Brick Road Into Gold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turner Entertainment Co., which owns the movie
``The Wizard of Oz,'' is off to see the banker to turn the Yellow
Brick Road into gold.
   The 50th anniversary of the release of the movie has ignited a
marketing mania of movie memorabilia. Turner Entertainment, which
also owns ``Gone With the Wind,'' stands to make millions from Oz
license rights alone.
   Turner has re-released the original movie to theaters across the
country and is selling a special Oz anniversary videocassette. The
tape includes 17 minutes of previously unseen footage of Buddy
Ebsen, the original Tin Man. The role went to Jack Haley after
Ebsen suffered an allergic reaction to the Tin Man's makeup.
   The video, introduced in early October, already has sold more
than 2 million copies at $24.95 each.
   Turner has produced a catalog to help fans skip through the
merchandising department of the Emerald City in the privacy of
their homes. It includes a special ``Wizard of Oz'' jean jacket for
$250, as well as a similar ``Gone With the Wind'' jacket.
   ``It's amazing the amount of interest people have about the Oz
collection,'' said Shelley Charles, general manager of the CNN
Turner Store. ``It just keeps going.''
   So far 49 companies have received licenses to market products,
ranging from Franklin Mint heirloom dolls, which retail from $135
to $245, to lunchboxes and playing cards. Several hundred people
are on waiting lists for official Oz silk-sreened color prints from
artist Melanie Taylor Kent which sell for $2,500 each.
   The Western Costume Co. in Hollywood is producing 500 pairs of
ruby slippers, replicas from the original mold of those Judy
Garland wore as Dorothy, for $5,000 a pair.
   ``We're getting 20 calls a day and we've only made three pair so
far,'' said company President Paul Abramowitz. ``This (the Oz
movie) is one of the great dreams of America. People want a piece
of it.''
   A reproduction pair of ruby slippers is on display at the CNN
Turner Store, not for sale. But a ruby slipper rhinestone pin can
be purchased for $150.
   Turner Entertainment is not the only entity profiting from Oz
mania. Auction houses selling props from the film also have
profited.
   One of the supposedly original seven pairs of ruby slippers sold
for $165,000 last year. The pointed Wicked Witch's hat Margaret
Hamilton wore sold for $33,000. Dorothy's twister-proof gingham
dress went for a non-bargain basement $22,000. And the Cowardly
Lion's can of ``witch remover'' brought in $20,000 for a New York
City collection house in June.
   There's even new interest in Oz author L. Frank Baum. ``The
Dreamer of Oz,'' an NBC-TV movie scheduled to air at Easter, is due
to start production next month with John Ritter as Baum.
   Baum was 44 when ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' was published in
1900 and made him wealthy. He died in 1919 and his creation is
still a moneymaker.

<HEAD>Georgia-Pacific Gets ICC Clearance to Include Railroads in Takeover
Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. has received government
clearance to include four railroads controlled by Great Northern
Nekoosa Corp. in its bid to acquire the paper products company.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the clearance, which
is required when the holder of a railroad seeks to acquire another,
said Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith.
   ``This is part of the process,'' Ms. Smith said Wednesday.
``Both Georgia-Pacific and Great Northern control railroads, and
this is a clearance necessary for approval to acquire Great
Northern's railroads.''
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific now controls four ``short line''
railroads, used primarily to transport products and raw materials
to and from company facilities in California, Arkansas, Louisiana
and Mississippi.
   Great Northern, based in Norwalk, Conn., also controls four rail
lines _ two in Georgia, one in Mississippi and one in Wisconsin.
   Georgia-Pacific last month announced a $3.13 billion offer to
acquire Great Northern. The Atlanta company has offered $58 a share
for each of Great Northern's approximately 54 million shares of
outstanding stock.
   Great Northern is expected to respond to the offer next week.
The tender offer expires at midnight EST Nov. 29.
   Stephen Hill, Great Northern's director of investor relations,
declined to comment on the ICC decision and on his company's
continued consideration of the Georgia-Pacific offer.
   ``We have to issue a formal response next week, and we will,''
Hill said.
   Since the announcement of Georgia-Pacific's takeover bid, Great
Northern's officers have been named in two separate federal
lawsuits challenging anti-takeover measures taken by the directors.
The lawsuits were filed in Portland, Maine, where Great Northern is
incorporated.

<HEAD>Court Suspends Chemical Giant's Gene Technology Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German court has blocked
plans by a leading chemical concern, Hoechst AG, to start
production of insulin with the help of genetic engineering.
   An administrative court in the city of Kassel issued a temporary
injunction Wednesday saying the giant West German company cannot
roceed with its plans as long as there is no federal law governing
gene technology. Such legislation is not expected to go into effect
before the start of 1991.
   The ruling, which reversed an earlier decision, sparked concern
about West Germany's ability to compete in the high-technology
field of genetic engineering.
   The court gave no final verdict on the substance of the case,
based on the suit filed by two citizens in 1985 against the Hesse
state government's license for the insulin project.
   The spread of genetic technology is opposed by environmental
groups and parts of the German general public.
   Hoechst, which is based in Frankfurt, said it will suspend
construction on the project for the time being and said it does not
expect a quick settlement of the dispute.
   The company said it views developments ``with great concern
because the future of the industrial use of genetic technology in
Germany thus remains in limbo.''
   Hesse state governor Walter Wallmann said the court verdict
affects ``the position of all of West German industry'' and urged
federal authorities to speed work on the legislation.
   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily newspaer said the
delay, ``which could last for years, is even more painful for the
company because its competition abroad can meanwhile gain
experience with the new technology.''
   The 70-million-mark (about $38 million) Hoechst project involves
making human insulin for diabetics from genetically altered
bacteria. Pilot production was due to start early next year.
Hoechst currently makes insulin from the pancreas of pigs.
   Wednesday's court decision can be challenged only in West
Germany's Constitutional Court. Hoechst officials headquarters in
Frankfurt declined to say whether they plan an appeal.

<TEXT>
   Police on Thursday charged 10 individuals and
their employers Natwest and UBS Phillips and Drew in connection
with irregularities in a 1987 sale of $1.3 billion worth of Blue
Arrow PLC stock.
   The announcement followed the arrest and release earlier
Thursday of an unspecified number of individuals. The 10 defendants
were charged with conspiracy to defraud and they are scheduled to
appear before City of London Magistrates Court on Friday, police
said.
   The investment firms Natwest Investment Bank Ltd., County
Natwest Ltd. and UBS Phillips and Drew Securities Ltd. also were
charged with conspiracy to defraud, as well as with conspiracy to
contravene Section 13 of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act
1958, police said.
   The police, and the Serious Fraud Squad, a central governmental
unit charged with investigating financial crime, have been
conducting an investigation into what is known as the Blue Arrow
affair.
   The investigation began after the Department of Trade and
Industry released a report in July on the events during and after
the sale of shares to existing stockholders.
   The report severely criticized National Westminster PLC, its
County Natwest unit, and Union Bank of Switzerland's UBS Phillips
and Drew for their conduct in the transaction.
   County Natwest was British employment agency Blue Arrow's
adviser in its 1987 bid for Manpower Inc., a much larger U.S.
employment company.
   When a $1.3 billion stock sale to finance the bid flopped,
County Natwest obscured how much of the stock was left in the
investment firms' hands.
   A series of top-level resignations followed publication of the
trade department's report, including that of the chairman of
National Westminster, Lord Boardman, and three board directors.
   Police said the people charged were Charles Nigel Villiers,
Jonathan Cohen, Stephen Clark, David Reed, Nicholas Weston Wells,
Alan Michael Keat, Philip Martin Domville Gibbs, Christopher Graham
Stainforth, Paul James Smallwood and Timothy Frank Brown.

   A New York investment group offered to buy
Allegheny International Inc. for $683.8 million, slightly less than
the $700 million it bid in July for the consumer products maker.
   Japonica Partners, in a letter to Allegheny International's
board of directors released Wednesday after the stock market
closed, said it would consider paying $700 million for the company
if it is allowed to review certain undisclosed financial
information.
   The lower offer reflects Japonica's belief that the company's
value has deteriorated by $100 million since the beginning of the
year, Japonica said.
   Allegheny International's board had not responded to Japonica by
last night, a Japonica spokeswoman said. Tim O-Brien, a spokesman
for Allegheny, said the company was reviewing the offer and had no
immediate comment.
   Meanwhile, Allegheny International, which has been operating
under Chapter 11 protection of the federal Bankruptcy Code, today
announced that the Wells Fargo Bank has withdrawn $400 million in
financing.
   The company had been counting on the money to cover some of its
claims and continue operations while it develops a reorganization
plan to emerge from bankruptcy court protection. Allegheny
International said other financing alternatives were being explored.
   A disclosure hearing on Allegheny International's most recent
plan to reorganize its debts was scheduled for this morning in
Pittsburgh. The company has been operating under Chapter 11 since
February 1988.
   Japonica, which was created by two former vice presidents of the
investment bank Goldman Sachs, is best known for an unsuccessful
bid earlier this year to acquire CNW Corp., a Chicago-based holding
company with railroad interests.
   Japonica's proposed offer includes $90 million in equity from
Japonica Partners, $70 million in other investor financing, $335.8
million in bank financing, $135 million in ``excess cash,'' and $53
million in debt reinstatement and tax and loan offsets, Japonica
said. It contains no high-yield financing, the so-called junk bonds
that have been under attack on Wall Street lately.
   Japonica said it was confident it could raise the financing.
   Proposed investors also include the Steinhardt Group, a New York
money management firm that holds a stake in USAir Group, and
several ``global institutions,'' Japonica's letter stated.
   Steinhardt is also a creditor in Allegheny International's
bankruptcy case.
   Allegheny International last month filed two alternate plans to
emerge from bankruptcy. The company has filed a total of eight
plans in its efforts to reorganize but has met consistent
opposition from creditors and shareholders. Its debts currently
total about $500 million.

   Chemical Banking Corp. is considering moving at
least 3,000 employees to New Jersey when the lease on its Park
Avenue headquarters runs out in 1994, according to a report
published today.
   The bank said in a letter to city officials last month that, due
to the high cost of Manhattan real estate, its front office staff
would be reduced from 4,700 to 1,600, the Wall Street Journal said.
   Senior Vice President Peter Brooke wrote that ``a plan has been
developed which retains a small `flagship' headquarters facility in
Manhattan containing staff who have an absolute need to be located
there. All other staff would be located in a second facility in New
Jersey.''
   A copy of the letter, dated Oct. 25, was obtained by the Journal.
   A bank spokesman confirmed that a plan had been drawn up to
move, but stressed that Chemical's headquarters would remain in the
city.
   The bank has a nonbinding option with Hartz Mountain Industries
to construct a building in Secaucus, N.J., according to a Hartz
Mountain official.
   City officials have since shown bank officials city-controlled
sites in Queens. The Journal quoted unidentified sources as saying
Chemical has shown little interest in moving operations to boroughs
other than Manhattan, where they would be eligible for the deepest
tax breaks.

   Stock prices rose slightly today in a generally
positive response to the latest statistics on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.87 to
2,626.23 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 486 up, 386 down and
562 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.08 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 0.4 percent in October.
   Excluding food and energy prices that are subject to large
fluctuations from month to month, the increase was 0.1 percent.
   Analysts said those figures provided fresh support for hopes
that inflationary pressures would remain subdued enough to keep
interest rates from rising significantly and allow for continued
economic growth.
   The Federal Reserve seemed to signal in advance its favorable
view of the inflation outlook with a move this week to relax its
credit policy slightly.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up { at
42[; USX, up [ at 34}; General Motors, up \ at 45, and Eastman
Kodak, up ] at 42}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.26 to 187.74. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .20 at 370.92.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 26.23
points to 2,623.36.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 1,076 up, 408 down and 473 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 170.15 million shares, against 163

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government received a
check worth $1.1 billion Thursday for the sale of the state-owned
steel company to the private sector.
   Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the money would be used
to reduce debt, thereby helping the government save about $200
million a year in interest payments.
   The check, believed the be the largest ever written in South
Africa, represented proceeds from the sale of 1.85 billion shares
in Iscor, the country's largest steel and iron producer. Shares
were sold at 2 rand each _ or roughly 76 cents _ to 300,000
purchasers.
   However, a controlling interest in the company was offered to a
range of major financial institutions and not made available to the
general public.
   About 54,000 Iscor employees, many of them blue-collar workers,
received 100 shares free.
   Iscor will continue to be run by its current management. The
board of directors will be determined by the major institutional
shareholders.
   The Iscor shares were listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange
for the first time on Wednesday, the largest listing in the
exchange's 101-year history.
   The result was a day of hectic trading that saw Iscor stock rise
from an opening price of 2.25 rand to 2.27 rand at the close. The
exchange said 32 million Iscor shares changed hands, by far the
most highly traded new listing ever on the exchange.
   Du Plessis said the privatization would enable the government to
spend less on interest payments and gain revenue by taxing Iscor.

<HEAD>Wang Announces `Reordering' of Business, Layoff of 2,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc., the struggling computer
maker that cut about 5,000 workers this year and posted financial
losses, today announced it would lay off 2,000 more workers as part
of a ``fundamental reordering.''
   ``Immediate and deliberate action does not call for another
reorganization,'' Richard Miller, president of the Lowell-based
company, said. ``Rather it demands a revolution _ a radical and
fundamental reordering of the way in which every individual at Wang
follows through on their respective responsibility to our
customers,'' he said in a news release..
   The company's new approach, according to Miller, will eliminate
bureaucracy to put Wang in closer touch with the needs of its
customers.
   ``We must become increasingly more efficient in the way we
work,'' Miller said.
   The result will be the elimination of approximately 2,000 jobs
throughout the company by Jan. 1. A severance package for these
employees will result in a onetime charge of $30 million against
earnings in the company's second quarter, which ends Dec. 31.
   Wang last month reported a first-quarter loss of $62.1 million,
and Miller said at the time he expected losses to continue through
the second quarter. But he predicted the company would return to
profitability by the fourth quarter next June.
   Wang Laboratories earlier this year had cut about 5,000
employees, lowering its workforce to approximately 25,000.
   The high-tech industry has suffered other setbacks. Data General
Corp. announced last month it would eliminate 2,200 jobs, and
Digital Equipment Corp. recently offered voluntary severance to 700
workers.
   ``To survive and prosper in the maturing market of the next
decade, Wang Laboratories must acknowledge that our customers are
our lifeline,'' Miller said.
   Miller said Wang would change the way it operates in various
phases of its business, including product development, technical
service support and the process of taking orders for products and
shipping them.

<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. on Thursday announced it
has agreed to sell its stake in Rothmans International PLC to the
subsidiary of a Swiss-based holding company for the equivalent of
$860 million.
   Philip Morris, a major consumer products company, said it
expects to realize a pre-tax gain of more than $450 million on the
sale.
   Under the transaction, Compagnie Financiere Richemont AG will
pay Philip Morris 610 million pounds in 10.25 percent
sterling-denominated notes maturing in 1994.
   Philip Morris purchased a 29.9 percent equity interest in
Rothmans, a London-based tobacco company, and related trademark
rights in 1981 for $350 million. Philip Morris said it will retain
the trademark rights in the United States.
   ``Our investment in Rothmans has increased in value and has
generated cash returns, but it has also been more passive than we
anticipated in 1981 and we now consider it preferable to divest
it,'' said Hamish Maxwell, chairman of Philip Morris.
   Philip Morris' three main operating segments are tobacco,
packaged foods and beverages. Its products include Marlboro and
Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes, Maxwell House coffee, Kraft-brand foods
and Miller beers. The company has its headquarters in New York.

<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices, pushed up by the steepest
increase in food costs in 22 months, rose 0.4 percent in October,
the government reported today.
   The increase in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index was
markedly smaller than the 0.9 percent jump in September but was
still surprisingly high to many economists.
   The September and October advances followed rare monthly
declines in July and August.
   Prices have been on a roller coaster this year, first surging
ahead and then easing during the summer after food and energy costs
moderated.
   For the first 10 months of the year, wholesale prices have been
rising at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, compared with an increase
of 4 percent for all of 1988.
   Food costs rose a steep 1.4 percent in October, following
declines in three of the four previous months. Analysts said the
jump in food costs reflected in part bad weather that affected
California and Florida vegetable crops.
   Vegetable prices shot up 18.9 percent. Other big advances in the
food category were a 9.5 percent increase in pork costs, a 5.6
percent rise in fish prices and a 4.9 percent increase for fruit.
   The overall 1.4 percent advance in food costs was the biggest
advance since a 1.5 percent rise in January 1988. But analysts said
the one-month increase in the volatile food category was not
alarming given the fact that food costs had been falling.
   Economists said they continued to believe that slower economic
growth would translate into lower inflationary pressures in the
months ahead.
   ``Assuming that food and energy prices remain relatively stable,
we expect further moderation in prices in 1990,'' said Stacy
Kottman, assistant director of economic forecasting at Georgia
State University.
   Energy costs, which had been the driving force behind the
September spurt in the overall index, moderated in October to a
slight 0.2 percent increase, far below the 6.5 percent surge in the
previous month.
   Gasoline prices were up 2.3 percent after a 10.6 percent jump in
September. The cost of natural gas dropped by 2.5 percent while
home heating prices fell by 0.5 percent last month.
   Wholesale prices, excluding energy and food costs, were up a
tiny 0.1 percent in October. Many analysts consider this figure a
better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures.
   New-car prices, which had also been a major factor in the
September inflation report, fell by 1.4 percent in October at the
start of the new model year.
   Before adjusting for normal seasonal variations, the wholesale
price index stood at 114.8 in October. This meant that a
hypothetical marketbasket of goods that cost $100 in the base year
of 1982 would have cost $114.80 last month, up from a cost of
$109.40 a year ago.
   Many economists are looking for price increases to be moderate
for the rest of this year and into 1990 as inflation is held in
check by a slowing economy. This forecast is based on a belief that
there will be no special factors pushing up costs, such as the 1988
drought that caused food prices to soar.
   As 1989 began, policymakers at the Federal Reserve were pushing
interest rates higher in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures.
   However, they switched tactics in May and started lowering rates
in an effort to keep the economy from tumbling into a recession.
   The latest round of interest rate declines came this week when
the Fed boosted the amount of cash reserves available to the
banking system. This allowed the federal funds rate to fall from
8.75 percent to 8.5 percent. This rate, which is the interest banks
charge each other to make overnight loans, is a key short-term
lending rate which is closely watched for clues to Fed policy
intentions.
   The Fed action came after weeks of complaints from the Bush
administration that the central bank was moving too slowly to lower
interest rates and would have to shoulder the blame if the economy
toppled into a recession.
   Economists predicted the Fed's move would translate into lower
consumer and business loan rates, including an expected cut in the
benchmark prime lending rate from 10.5 percent down to 10 percent.
The prime rate is used as a base to calculate more than one-third
of all business and consumer loans.

   Grain and soybean futures opened steady to
slightly lower this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading in corn and soybeans is expected to be subdued as
investors await the release this afternoon of the U.S. Agriculture
Department's crop report.
   The report may show larger than previously expected corn and
soybean crops. A lack of export business may also put a damper on
prices, said analyst Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc. in
Chicago.
   Wheat prices are expected to get some support from the National
Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast, which calls for dry
weather in winter wheat crop areas.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to a \ cent higher with

<TEXT>
   Britain today banned milk sales by more than 900
farms because of lead-tainted feed that killed 18 cattle, and the
government blamed the contamination on a criminal conspiracy.
   Hundreds of Dutch farms also were affected after dozens of
cattle died of lead poisoning.
   In Brussels, European Economic Community Agriculture
Commissioner Ray MacSharry ordered an immediate investigation into
the alleged conspiracy that is believed to stretch across several
EEC nations.
   MacSharry will contact ``all the relevant authorities in
Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands and West Germany,'' said an EEC
Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   British Agriculture Minister John Gummer said a shipment of rice
bran used as cattle feed started in Rangoon, Burma, and was
contaminated with lead from other cargo aboard the ship on its
journey to the Belgian port of Antwerp.
   Authorities in Antwerp diverted the feed to Holland for
destruction, he said. But instead it passed through several hands
and was turned into maize pellets that ended up being sold by a
feed importing company in Britain and the Netherlands.
   ``There has been a major criminal conspiracy,'' said Gummer said.
   ``It has meant that there are 300 farms in Holland which are
under restriction and I have no doubt that by the time we have
completed the material here during the day, we may have as many as
1,000 farms or just over that in Britain,'' he said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
   The Agriculture Ministry said milk from the 940 affected British
farms, mostly in southwest England, is being collected separately
for testing and thousands of gallons have been withheld from public
sale.
   The ministry said milk from 200 farms had been tested and 89
were found to have milk above the trigger level for concern about
lead contamination but below the safety level of 200 parts of lead
per billion.
   Officials said most of the farms which had received the feed had
now been traced.
   On Wednesday, Gummer urged the European Commission to open a
full-scale inquiry into the alleged conspiracy.
   National Farmers' Union deputy president David Naish said
farmers had suffered heavy losses.
   ``There are going to be some very substantial civil claims _
initially against the suppliers of the feed and then going back
further down the chain,'' he said.
   In The Hague, Dutch Agriculture Ministry spokesman Mat Thissen
said that the Dutch authorities had thoroughly investigated the
origin of the tainted rice bran after more several dozen cattle
died of lead poisoning in the northern Netherlands last month.
   ``The (feed) component was traced to a firm in Dronten (in the
central Netherlands), then to back Antwerp and also Hamburg,''
Thissen told The Associated Press, adding that he hoped the inquest
would be completed by next week.
   He disputed part of Gummer's account, saying there was no
evidence yet indicating that the cattle feed had been shipped to
the Netherlands to be destroyed.
   Thissen said the Dronten firm had exported part of the tainted
rice bran to Britain, but he did not know the quantity involved.

   Stock prices were mixed today in a sluggish
response to the latest statistics on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 26.23 on Wednesday,
slipped back 3.89 to 2,619.47 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 659 up, 624 down and 528
unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 0.4 percent in October, a bit
more than had been expected.
   Excluding food and energy prices that are subject to large
fluctuations from month to month, however, the increase was 0.1
percent.
   Analysts said those figures provided fresh support for hopes
that inflationary pressures would remain subdued enough to keep
interest rates from rising significantly and allow for continued
economic growth.
   The Federal Reserve seemed to signal in advance its favorable
view of the inflation outlook with a move this week to relax its
credit policy slightly.
   Consolidated Freightways fell 2\ to 28[ in active trading. The
company said its results for the fourth quarter would be around the
break-even point, or possibly a loss.

   Volume on the Big Board came to 71.83 million shares at

<TEXT>
   Steve Wynn, the golden boy of Nevada gaming, is
putting the finishing touches on his $630 million Mirage resort,
just down the Strip from where this city's glitz ignited his
imagination 37 years ago.
   Employees began reporting for orientation earlier this month to
work out the kinks before the doors open to the public Nov. 22. The
Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran fight follows at the resort Dec. 7.
   Wynn's 30-story showplace cost more than 100 times the value of
the cluster of casinos that dotted the Strip when he first visited
here in 1952. And it has sparked a multibillion-dollar building
boom unprecedented in the city's history.
   New resorts are popping out of the desert and renovations and
expansions are under way at many of the city's older properties.
   Some operators admit privately they're fixing up and adding on
because of the challenge of the 3,049-room Mirage.
   Wynn, 47, is the majority shareholder of Golden Nugget Inc.,
which owns the Mirage. Sometimes he refers to the Mirage as ``the
joint,'' a throwback to the jargon of another era when his father,
Michael, dreamed of opening a bingo parlor in this growing gaming
town.
   Other times he refers to the Mirage as an ``experience'' or a
``wonderment the world will flock to see.''
   Guests arrive via a palm-lined entry that features a 54-foot
volcano, three lagoons and waterfalls _ hardly your typical desert
environment. The lagoons and waterfalls are fed by pipes that pump
100,000 gallons of water a minute.
   Valets whisk arriving cars into a labyrinth of tunnels under the
resort.
   ``Just like a James Bond movie, huh?'' Wynn joked as his
Mercedes whipped along the underground maze during a pre-opening
tour.
   The top five floors of the 30-story resort contain 260 penthouse
suites for coveted casino customers. And for his ``stratosphere''
players, Wynn has six ground-level private bungalows, complete with
their own swimming pools.
   The swimming pool is a quarter-mile around and nearby is a
dolphin habitat approved by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   Registering guests will find themselves facing a giant fish tank
whose inhabitants include 4-foot sharks.
   ``The sharks will, of course, prompt a lot of bad jokes about
what will happen if you don't pay your markers,'' Wynn laughed.
   The casino covers the space of two football fields, but will be
broken up by thatched huts containing such operations as the cage,
the pit and a bar to make the area appear more intimate.
   In one area of the casino, customers can play nickel slots and
order pizza or pasta. Nearby, a small room provides
``stratosphere'' customers their own private casino, with $1,000
chips the smallest available.
   ``We'll let you gamble there as high as you've got the nerve,''
Wynn promised.
   The hotel's 1,500-seat showroom will feature illusionists
Siegfried and Roy, who returned earlier this month from a tour of
Japan and a stint at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.
   The volcano and waterfalls in front of the Mirage are designed
to block the view of other resorts across the Strip.
   ``I'm burned out on neon,'' said Wynn, whose Golden Nugget Hotel
in downtown's Glitter Gulch is also void of any neon. ``I think
it's cheap. To me, neon is yesterday Las Vegas.''
   It was the neon that captivated Wynn in 1952 when he came to Las
Vegas with his father, who hoped to start a bingo parlor in the
city. Old-time gaming figures blocked the elder Wynn, sending him
and his son home to Maryland, nursing busted dreams.
   Wynn later returned to Las Vegas, bought an interest in the
Frontier Hotel, then bought stock in the Golden Nugget and
eventually took control of the Nugget.
   Wynn is confident his new property will be profitable, despite
the high cost, saying it can earn the necessary $1 million a day.
   Wynn said the high-rise came in on budget despite some guesswork
on exotic frills.
   ``What we could not budget intelligently was the atrium, the
volcanoes. There was no way of knowing those costs in advance. What
do you do? Look under the Yellow Pages for volcanoes?''
   Donald Trump's new 1,200-room Taj-Mahal in Atlantic City is
expected to cost $1.2 billion when completed next year. Wynn says
his Mirage would have cost $1.5 billion to build in Atlantic City
or New York City, where construction costs are higher.
   Wynn, who's had off-and-on battles with Trump, said he wants to
be known as a hotel operator, not ``the star.''
   ``I want people to say that Steve Wynn built the best hotel in
the world. I don't want to say I own it. I want to be the guy that
designed it. That's my edge.''

<HEAD>Drexel to Cut 300 Jobs by Year's End</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., joining the ranks
of Wall Street firms forced to cut back their payrolls in the face
of high costs, will eliminate about 300 jobs by year end, a
spokesman confirmed Thursday.
   A Drexel spokesman said over 100 people already have been let go
from the firm's fixed-income and equities departments. The
remaining cuts are expected to come from Drexel's corporate finance
and junk bond operations.
   But unidentified sources cited in Thursday editions of the Wall
Street Journal said employees are braced for cuts of up to 800.
Drexel's spokesman responded that he doesn't ``see it getting up
that high.
   The Drexel dismissals follow similar moves begun earlier this
week by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which began laying off
employees in a cutback that could total 800 before 1990 begins.
   Wall Street firms, particularly retail brokerages catering to
individual investors, have been under increasing pressure to trim
costs in the face of rising operating expenses.
   Most firms are expected to show a decline in trading profits
this year due to the stock market's October plunge and the general
pressure on takeover stocks, which had been driving the market
higher.
   Separately, Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. has begun charging customers a
``handling fee'' on all individual stock and bond trades. The firm
is among the last of the major brokerages to do so, and a Bear,
Stearns spokesman indicated that the firm has not raised its
commission fees in 20 years.
   The fee, which amounts to $2.50 per trade, is expected to cover
costs and add about $1 million a year in income to the firm's
balance sheet.

<HEAD>Royal Dutch-Shell's Third-Quarter Profit Falls 16 Percent; BP's Drops
34 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Companies and British
Petroleum Co. PLC, two of the world's largest oil companies, posted
sharply lower third-quarter profits Thursday, hurt by sagging
results in two main businesses.
   Royal Dutch-Shell, the world's second largest oil company behind
Exxon Corp., said its net income for the three months ended Sept.
30, fell 16 percent to 652 million pounds, or $1.04 billion,
compared with 778 million pounds, or $1.2 billion, in the same
period a year ago. The company does not report consolidated
per-share earnings.
   Revenue rose 12.5 percent to 16.2 billion pounds from 14.4
billion pounds in the comparable 1988 period.
   London-based British Petroleum, which owns Cleveland-based
Standard Oil Co., said its net profit for the three months fell 34
percent to 211 million pounds compared with 318 million pounds a
year ago.
   Revenue for the fourth-largest oil concern totaled 7.6 billion
pounds, up 14 percent from 6.65 billion pounds in the same 1988
period.
   Both companies' chemicals businesses suffered due to lower
demand and prices for chemical products, while refining and
marketing results fell as refined product margins and sales volumes
declined.
   The companies' financial statements are based on British
accounting methods and cannot be directly compared with those of
most American companies. Inventories are valued on the basis of
first in first out (FIFO), instead of the typical American system
of last in first out (LIFO).
   On the American basis, Royal Dutch-Shell's third-quarter net
income fell 20 percent to 667 million pounds, from 837 million
pounds a year ago.
   Royal Dutch-Shell, based in The Hague, the Netherlands, said a
38 percent drop in chemicals earnings offset substantial gains in
oil exploration and production.
   Refining and marketing results also slipped lower while
corporate charges jumped 64 percent to 115 million pounds from 70
million pounds a year ago, the result of currency losses totaling
101 million pounds, more than triple year-earlier losses.
   For the first nine months of the year, Royal Dutch-Shell's net
income advanced 31 percent to 2.93 billion pounds from 2.23 billion
pounds. On the American basis, it rose 12 percent to 2.68 billion
pounds from 2.4 billion pounds. Revenue gained 12 percent to 46.5
billion pounds from 41.6 billion pounds.
   British Petroleum's third-quarter profit on an American
accounting basis fell 34 percent to 264 million pounds from 402
million pounds. Per share earnings came to 4.2 pence a share, or 7
cents, compared with 5.2 pence, or 8 cents in the comparable period
last year.
   British Petroleum said higher crude oil prices only partially
offset lower production and higher production costs and taxes.
Chemicals earnings declined, reflecting weaker product demand, and
refining and marketing results fell 29 percent as U.S. margins
slipped.
   For the nine months, net profit amounted to 1.3 billion pounds
compared with 938 million pounds in the year-earlier period.
Revenue gained 10 percent to 21.6 billion pounds from 19.6 billion
pounds.
   On an American basis, earnings totaled 1.02 billion pounds
compared with 1.13 billion pounds. Earnings per share amounted to
23.5 pence compared with 15.5 pence.

<HEAD>May Department Stores Posts Flat Earnings; Gap's Profit Up 29 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The May Department Stores Co., one of the country's leading
retailers, on Thursday said its third-quarter income grew only
slightly over last year's profit, which was boosted by an $18
million one-time gain.
   Specialty apparel retailer Gap Inc. reported its profit jumped
29 percent in the third quarter, helped by strong sales at its
flagship stores and at GapKids.
   May earned $97 million, or 69 cents a share, in the three months
ended Oct. 28 compared with $100 million, or 68 cents, in the
comparable 1988 quarter.
   The $100 million from last year's third quarter contained a gain
from May's sale of real estate and pre-payment of a long-term debt.
Without that gain, net income would have been $82 million, or 56
cents a share.
   Sales for the quarter were $2.27 billion, up 9 percent from
$2.08 billion in last year's third quarter.
   ``Sales maintained a good pace throughout the entire period and
we are pleased with the results,'' said David Farrell, chairman and
chief executive officer. ``We are well positioned for the important
1989 Christmas season.''
   May owns 14 regional department store chains around the country
and a national chain of discount shoe stores. The company's
best-known chain is Lord &amp; Taylor.
   The St. Louis-based retailer recently completed the o dry districts
only to
pre-empt a campaign it expected from the pro-drinking forces.
   Sunday pub openings are permitted in England as well as in
Scotland and Northern Ireland which have separate licensing
regulations.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain futures closed lower and soybeans were
higher in quiet trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading in corn and soybeans was subdued as investors awaited
the release of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's latest crop
report.
   The report was expected to show a larger than previously
expected corn and soybean crop.
   Corn prices received some support from commercial demand, with
two processors making sizable purchases.
   Soybeans performed better, with increased activity in the oil
market, and the movement of beans into storage, said Pat O'Connell,
an analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat prices were forced lower due to a lack of export business,
although some support was received from the National Weather
Service's six- to 10-day forecast, which calls for dry weather in
winter wheat crop areas.
   At the close, wheat was a { cent to 1{ cent lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.03\ a bushel; corn was 1}
cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at $2.36\ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $1.42\ a bushel;
soybeans were 2{ cents to 5 cents higher with November at $5.68 a
bushel.

   Stock prices drifted lower today in a sluggish
response to the latest statistics on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 26.23 on Wednesday,
dropped back 10.04 to 2,613.32 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 670 up, 751 down and 505
unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 0.4 percent in October, a bit
more than had been expected.
   Excluding food and energy prices that are subject to large
fluctuations from month to month, however, the increase was 0.1
percent.
   Analysts said those figures provided fresh support for hopes
that inflationary pressures would remain subdued enough to keep
interest rates from rising significantly and allow for continued
economic growth.
   The Federal Reserve seemed to signal in advance its favorable
view of the inflation outlook with a move this week to relax its
credit policy slightly.
   Consolidated Freightways fell 2[ to 28\ in active trading. The
company said its results for the fourth quarter would be around the
break-even point, or possibly a loss.
   Among the blue chips, Philip Morris rose \ to 41~ and Merck
gained 1[ to 79\, but American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped | to

   The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday its
fourth-quarter earnings rose by 56 percent, reflecting strong
attendance at its theme parks and booming results from its home
video unit which had big sales on its release of the movie
``Bambi.''
   Disney said its profit rose 35 percent for the year with big
contributions from all of its main businesses, which include filmed
entertainment, consumer products and theme parks and resorts.
   In filmed entertainment, for instance, the company had higher
than expected profits from movies like ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids,'' and ``Dead Poets Society.''
   For the quarter ending Sept. 30, Disney earned $212.7 million,
or $1.54 per share, compared to $136.4 million, or 99 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose by 33 percent to $1.3 billion from
$1 billion.
   For the fiscal year, net income was $703.3 million, or $5.10 per
share, compared to $522 million, or $3.80 per share, last year.
   Full-year revenue climbed 34 percent to $4.6 billion from $3.4
billion.
   Operating income climbed 62 percent to $373 million for the
quarter and 39 percent for the fiscal year to $1.2 billion.
   Disney chairman Michael Eisner and president Frank Wells noted
in a statement that more people attended Disney theme parks than
ever, and spent more on average. The new Disney-MGM Studios
attraction in Florida was a major contributor to the sector's
earnings, they said.
   Eisner was brought in to run Disney at the end of the fiscal
year 1984, in which the company earned $98 million on revenues of
$1.7 billion. Since then, annual revenues have increased at an
average rate of 35 percent, profits are up sevenfold, and the stock
is worth about eight times as much per share after adjusting for
stock splits.

<HEAD>Former Beatles And Their Record Companies Settle Lawsuits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Beatles Paul McCartney, George
Harrison and Ringo Starr and the wife of the late John Lennon have
settled a series of lawsuits among themselves and their record
companies, ending a decade of legal fights.
   The settlements between the members of the group, Lennon's widow
Yoko Ono, Apple Records, EMI Records and Capital Records were
announced Wednesday in a statement by Bhaskar Menon, the chairman
of EMI Music Worldwide and Capitol-EMI Music Inc.
   As part of the agreement, neither side commented about the
settlements, and terms were sealed.
   ``The parties have agreed, as a specific term of the settlement,
that neither they nor their representatives or advisors will be
permitted to make any comment or statement regarding the settlement
other than it appears in this announcement,'' Menon said in the
statement.
   The Beatles, one of the most popular and prolific bands in the
history of rock'n'roll, disbanded in 1970.
   In the formal statement Menon praised the group's contribution
to music.
   ``The Beatles' recordings are a unique legacy in the history of
popular music which EMI has been privileged to represent since
1962,'' Menon said.
   ``We are most delighted to have resolved all the differences
which arose between us in recent years, and look forward to the
continuation of our long standing and close relationship with the
artists and Apple.''
   The Beatles' Apple Records filed its first suit in 1979 against
EMI and its American subsidiary, Capitol Records, alleging the
company underpaid royalties by not reporting the sale of 19 million
records from 1969 to 1979. The group sought $50 million in damages.
   Apple also sued EMI in 1987, alleging it was delaying a release
of Beatles material on compact discs, and also challenged royalty
rates paid to individual group members.
   ``If they have indeed come to the end of the long and winding
road, it's wonderful,'' said Elliot Mintz, a spokesman for Ono.
``It's such a confusing myriad of issues that even people who have
been close to the principals have a difficult time grasping it.
   ``A number of attorneys on both sides of the Atlantic have
probably put their children through college on this,'' Mintz said.

<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pair of IBM employees who thought they
had pulled off an undetectable theft were arrested in a parking lot
trying to peddle discount computer parts to undercover officers.
   Jay Robert Wetterer, 36, and Steven Mark Shoeppe, 34, both of
Boca Raton, were held Thursday at the Manatee County Jail on $10
million bail each.
   Circuit Judge George Brown said the high bond was justified by
the value of the stolen goods and the suspects' extensive
out-of-state contacts.
   The theft of $1.8 million in computer chips and other parts _
one of the biggest ever at International Business Machines Corp. _
began when Wetterer and Shoeppe tried to take advantage of a glitch
in inventory records, said Sam Jones, spokesman for the Tampa Bay
region of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
   Wetterer, a senior buyer who worked for IBM for eight years, and
Shoeppe, a cost engineer for 10 years, allegedly took the chips and
tried to sell them at a reduced price, Jones said.
   After lengthy negotiations, state undercover agents arranged to
buy 910 parts from Wetterer and Shoeppe for $300,000 in the
Sarasota parking lot, authorities said.
   Each faces two counts each of dealing in stolen property, grand
larceny, grand theft and crimes against computers.
   In June 1988, IBM officials announced they were moving the
company's personal computer manufacturing plant from Boca Raton to
Raleigh, N.C.
   During the relocation, about 1,300 memory-boosting computer
parts were incorrectly labeled and sent to a repackaging plant in
West Palm Beach.
   ``So the officials from the West Palm Beach office said, `Get a
hold of our man Wetterer and let him straighten it out,''' Jones
said.
   ``Apparently (Wetterer) felt everything was so busy, that no one
would notice them missing,'' Jones said. ``Not only would the
company not know they were missing, they would not be able to trace
them.''

   Two major British banks, Lloyds Bank PLC and
National Westminster Bank PLC, on Thursday announced they were
increasing their reserves to cover potential losses on loans made
to developing countries.
   Lloyds Bank said it was increasing specific provisions for loans
made to problem countries by the equivalent of $1.9 billion to
counter what it called a ``continued deterioration'' in the
servicing of the debt.
   Later, National Westminster Bank announced it added a further
$914 million to its specific provisions for lending to 27 countries
with repayment difficulties.
   In the third quarter, major U.S. banks took similar measures to
bolster their protection against losses amid widespread perception
that economic and political difficulties in the Third World might
make it impossible for countries to repay their debt.
   The additional provisions will lift Lloyds' cover on medium- and
long-term debt to problem countries to 85 percent of its $5.7
billion exposure.
   Natwest said the new provisions would raise its overall level of
cover on its $3.5 billion of exposure to 72 percent.

<HEAD>Wang Announces `Reordering' of Business, Layoff of 2,000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Wang Laboratories Inc., declaring
computers no longer represent a boom industry, announced Thursday
his company would undergo a ``fundamental reordering'' and cut
2,000 more workers from its payroll.
   The cutback was the latest sign of a high-tech industry slowdown
that has contributed to a softening of the region's economy.
   ``Some fundamental things are happening that will drive all
(computer) companies to do things differently or they will fail,''
Wang president Richard Miller said.
   Miller was named president of Wang in August, succeeding
Frederick Wang, who had been ousted from the job by An Wang, his
father, company founder and chairman.
   Prior to Thursday's announcement, the company already had cut
about 5,000 jobs this year and announced plans to sell $200 million
in assets. Furthermore, Wang reported a first quarter loss of $62.1
million in the first quarter that ended Sept. 30, and Miller
predicted more losses for the second quarter.
   Miller said under the company's new approach, Wang will cut its
bureaucracy to get in closer touch with the needs of its customers.
   ``We are eliminating the layers between the field and
laboratory,'' he said. ``We will eliminate entire functions _
functions that I view as stifling.''
   For example, he said, the company's product development programs
often duplicate efforts, with no single group taking
responsibility. As a result, products often have been introduced
late.
   But Miller said departments will be combined, leading to a
streamlined approach.
   The reorganization of the company will mean the loss of about
2,000 by Jan. 1, lowering the Wang workforce to just over 22,000,
he said.
   About 1,000 of the layoffs will occur in Massachusetts, mostly
at the company's headquarters in Lowell, with the rest being
scattered around the world.
   A severance package for these employees will result in a onetime
charge of $30 million in the company's second quarter, which ends
Dec. 31.
   Miller said the restructuring announced Thursday would cut
annual costs by about $115 million, but he stressed that the
company was not simply calculating how much needed to be cut in
order to be profitable.
   The Massachusetts high-tech industry has suffered other
setbacks. Data General Corp. announced last month it would
eliminate 2,200 jobs, and Digital Equipment Corp. recently offered
voluntary severance to 700 workers.
   ``I think restructuring is becoming a common word in this
industry,'' Miller said.
   Miller said much of Wang's bureaucracy grew while the high-tech
industry was booming. But now the industry has reached a
``maturing'' stage with slower growth, he said.
   The bureaucracy ``just built up because of the luxury of very
big margins in a high growth industry,'' he said.
   But while Miller pointed to the fluctuations in the computer
industry for many of his company's problems, analysts said some of
the trouble _ particularly poor customer service _ has been unique
to Wang.
   ``They have had this problem with service and support for a long
time,'' said Steven Wendler, an analyst with Gartner Group Inc. in
Stamford, Conn. ``Rick Miller is a breath of fresh air.''
   Also, Wendler said, after the company completes the cost-cutting
measures, ``the hemorrhaging, financially, will stop.''
   ``A lot of Wang customers have the shakes right now,'' he said.
   George Elling, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Inc. in New York, said during the 1970s and early 1980s, Wang
did not pay attention to customer service because it became
confident as a leader in word processing equipment.
   ``They had something everyone wanted,'' he said. ``People were
willing to put up with poorer service.''
   ``Wang was too slow to recognize they needed to change,'' he
said.
   Part of the change, Miller said, will include more focus on
software and other computer applications.
   ``Most customers are not crying for new technology,'' he said.
``They are crying for new applications of technology.''

<HEAD>Government Withdraws Nuclear Plants From Electricity Privatization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday it would withdraw
nuclear plants from the planned privatization of the nation's
electricity industry.
   Energy Secretary John Wakeham, speaking in the House of Commons,
said the move was necessary to ensure the public sale of the
industry is held before the next national elections, which must be
called by mid-1992.
   Wakeham said high costs associated with nuclear energy also were
a key factor in the decision to keep the plants under government
control.
   The electricity privatization, which had been expected to raise
up to $43 billion, would be the largest yet under Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's successful program.
   Since the privatization program began, the government has sold
billions of dollars worth of state-owned companies _ including
Jaguar PLC and British Airways PLC _ to promote capitalism.
   But the electricity sale and the planned sell-off of Britain's
water industry are highly controversial. Opponents say such vital
utilities, particularly nuclear plants, should stay in state hands
for security reasons.
   Britain's 18 existing nuclear plants will be placed under the
control of a government-owned company after the government
privatizes their current parent, the Central Electricity Generating
Board, Wakeham said.
   The overall plan involves breaking up the Central Electricity
Generating Board into privately held generating companies called
National Power and Power Gen and into a single distribution company
called National Grid Co.

   Assets of the nation's 478 money market mutual
funds rose $3.92 billion in the latest week to a fifth straight
record level, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $363.81 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $2.37 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 235 general purpose funds rose $1.49 billion to $119.15
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds increased $165 million to
$157.4 billion, and assets of 146 institutional funds rose $2.27
billion to $87.26 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.07 percent from 8.12 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.14 percent from 8.19 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
42 days, up from 41 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was 6.40
percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.08 percent from 5.09 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.16
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.12 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.21 percent on 1-year CDs, down
from 8.22 percent; 8.14 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.16
percent; and 8.14 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged.

<TEXT>
   Air Canada's president on Thursday argued for
freer airline travel in Canada and the United States, saying it
should be liberalized in the same way as trade between the two
nations.
   ``We'd like to have a greater presence here in North America,''
said Pierre Jeanniot, president and chief executive officer of
Canada's largest airline. ``Let's not exclude air travel out of
free trade. We should work towards integrating this air market.''
   Air travel was excluded from the historic free-trade agreement
between the United States and Canada which took effect at the
beginning of this year.
   Jeanniot said Canadian airlines should be given rights of
cabotage in the United States, and U.S. carriers should be accorded
the same rights in Canada. Under cabotage, which is not currently
allowed, airlines would be permitted to carry passengers between
two cities within a foreign country.
   Air Canada would be able to fly, for example, between Boston and
Chicago or Atlanta and San Francisco, while now it can only operate
between those cities and Canadian destinations. Likewise, a U.S.
carrier such as American Airlines or USAir could carry Canadian
passengers between Montreal and Toronto.
   Other airline executives, such as Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank
Lorenzo, have recently advocated cabotage for U.S. and European
carriers to help cope with the growing globalization of world air
travel.
   Jeanniot, speaking to a small group of reporters in New York,
said the freer U.S.-Canada air ties could become part of a wider
liberalization including European and Asian airlines.
   ``If we (the United States and Canada) can't bring it about,
what's the hope for the rest of the world?'' he asked.
   Jeanniot suggested that, to alleviate government fears, the
granting of cabotage rights by the two countries could be started
on a limited basis, perhaps as an experiment for a year. U.S. and
Canadian airlines could start by flying between foreign cities from
which they already operate, he said.
   ``I don't want to be United Airlines; I don't want to fly
everywhere in North America,'' he said.
   While the Canadian government has shown itself to be ``quite
progressive'' about the issue of cabotage, the Bush administration
appears to be concerned about potential internal competition from
low-cost Asian airlines, Jeanniot said.

<TEXT>
   As takeovers and expansion attempts make cash
flow even more important to airline executives, leaders of the
Association of Flight Attendants tried Thursday to come up with a
strategy to secure higher pay and job security for their members.
   Susan Bianchi-Sand, president of the 27,000-member union, said
its board of directors is focusing on short-range planning because
of what is happening in the airline industry.
   Recent events include UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines,
pursuing a buyout or recapitalization of the nation's
second-largest carrier; Eastern Airlines struggling to make a
comeback in the face of an eight-month-old strike; and a number of
airlines, including United, battling to increase service to Europe
and Asia.
   ``We will be going to the table with newer and stronger
proposals for job security,'' said Ms. Bianchi-Sand, whose union
represents flight attendants on 18 airlines, including United. ``We
will want guarantees that the contract stays intact if a company is
bought.''
   Flight attendants' pay has fallen at carriers that have been
hard pressed by competition, she noted.
   In recent years, attendants have accepted pay cuts of as much as
20 percent to help carriers such as Republic Airlines, Western
Airlines and Braniff Inc. to survive. Republic and Western have
since been merged into larger carriers, while Braniff recently
filed for bankruptcy reorganization for the second time in seven
years.
   Also forcing down salaries has been two-tier wage scales, with
new flight attendants accepting starting salaries far below those
given their senior colleagues.
   Jack Hunter, an airline analyst for Howe Barnes Investments Inc.
in Chicago, noted that salary for B-scale attendants is $950 a
month, and that most contracts call for flight attendants to remain
at the lower scale for five years.
   ``The attendants will be trying to cut the B scale from five
years to three years'' in future negotiations, Hunter said.
   But that will be a difficult task because of airline expansion
plans and takeover activity, he said.
   Last year, most major airlines had strong profits, with
Dallas-based American Airlines showing a $476 million profit and
Chicago-based United $372 million.
   ``The airlines are trying to cut their costs,'' Hunter said.
``And they think that the only way they can keep expanding is
buying new airplanes. And the only way they can do that is a strong
cash flow.''
   Ms. Bianchi-Sand said her Washington, D.C.-based union also will
emphasize the issue of flight attendant health in future
negotiations with the carriers.
   ``There are issues of reproductive concerns because of
radioactive cargo, and cabin air quality apart from the smoking
issue,'' she said.
   Fumes are generated by cabin materials, Ms. Bianchi-Sand said,
and flight attendants are plagued by back problems caused by
pushing food carts that weigh more than 200 pounds.
   Perhaps one of the most difficult tasks for the union is
reaching a contract with United for its 14,000 flight attendants.
   Following the failure of a $6.75 billion takeover effort by
United's top management, its pilots union and British Airways PLC,
the attendants demanded a resumption of the federal mediation that
was suspended in August due to the buyout efforts.
   United's flight attendants joined the buyout bid in its latter
stages, a move Ms. Bianchi-Sand described as primarily a protective
strategy.
   ``We felt it was better to be part of the process instead of
letting someone else determine the fate of the airline,'' she said.
   Resuming contract talks could lead to a walkout if the
negotiations are as unsuccessful as they have been for the past two
years, union officials say.
   ``They had enormous demands for concessions that did not fit
reality,'' said Ms. Bianchi-Sand. ``They were seeking work rule and
benefit concessions that were not acceptable to membership.''
   Hunter says he believes flight attendants' negotiators will find
their work more difficult as airlines continue to cut costs to
maximize profits.
   ``In the future, you will see a situation of 10-year contracts
for flight attendants,'' he said.
   ``Attendants will be allowed to work 10 years only, there will
no longer be attendants working for years beyond that. The unions
will fight that hard.''

   The dollar rose Thursday against most major
currencies except the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid for gold at 4 p.m. EST of $386.30 a troy ounce, down from
$387.50 late Wednesday.
   Dealers said the dollar had little reaction to a
larger-than-expected 0.4 percent rise in U.S. wholesale prices in
October. Analysts had expected an increase in the Producer Price
Index of 0.2 percent.
   ``You saw most of the market react rather subdued to the PPI
report,'' said David Ethridge, vice president of foreign exchange
at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ``It wasn't a shock.''
   Currency traders said the dollar remained strong despite the
market's perception that the Federal Reserve is relaxing its credit
policy, which likely would encourage lower interest rates. Falling
interest rates usually depress the dollar's value.
   The key factor was selling between other currencies that pushed
down the dollar vs. the Japanese yen, said Keith Raphael, an
assistant vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York.
   He said the yen rose against the West German mark and also
gained ground against the dollar in the morning. The selloff ran
out of steam when the dollar hit 142.25 yen and traders bought
dollars in an afternoon rally, traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 142.70 Japanese yen, down 0.27
yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar rose to
142.85 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 143.13, down from
143.18 late Wednesday.
   Raphael said the dollar rose against the British pound because
the Bank of England expressed concern that pressure to increase
wages could lead to a recession.
   In London, the British pound edged up to $1.5863 from $1.5860
late Wednesday. Later in New York, the pound fetched $1.5823, less
than $1.5885 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8523 West German marks, up from
1.8445; 1.6250 Swiss francs, up from 1.6168; 6.2810 French francs,
up from 6.2515; 1,354.25 Italian lire, up from 1,347.25; and 1.1670
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1698.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.8475 West German marks, up from 1.8450;
1.6212 Swiss francs, up from 1.6170; 6.2545 French francs, up from
6.2510; 2.0815 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0805; 1,351.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,349.50; and 1.1675 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1695.
   Gold bullion rose in London to a late bid of $386.25 a troy
ounce from $384.75 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $387.30
from $384 late Wednesday.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold fell to $387.10 from
$388.80 the day before.
   Earlier, gold fell $1.08 an ounce in Hong Kong to $386.72.
   Silver bullion rose in late London trading to a four-month high
of $5.33 a troy ounce from $5.25 late Wednesday.
   On New York's Comex, silver contracts for current delivery
closed at $5.28 a troy ounce, down from $5.295.

   The stock market pulled back Thursday after the
rally of the two preceding sessions faltered amid worries about
corporate earnings.
   Traders showed little enthusiasm over government statistics on
inflation that most analysts described as favorable.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen more
than 41 points Tuesday and Wednesday, dropped 19.67 to 2,603.69.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
660 up, 815 down and 487 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 143.39 million
shares, down from 170.15 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 172.02 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.4 percent in October, a bit more than had
been expected.
   Excluding food and energy prices that are subject to large
fluctuations from month to month, however, the increase was 0.1
percent.
   Analysts said those figures provided fresh support for hopes
that inflationary pressures would remain subdued enough to keep
interest rates from rising significantly and allow for continued
economic growth.
   The Federal Reserve seemed to signal in advance its favorable
view of the inflation outlook with a move this week to relax its
credit policy slightly.
   Still, analysts said stock traders seemed preoccupied with
worries about recent weakness in corporate earnings.
   Energy stocks, for example, were mostly lower as Royal
Dutch-Shell Group and British Petroleum posted lower profits for
the third quarter.
   Royal Dutch Petroleum shares dropped 1} to 64|; Shell Transport
| to 40\, and BP | to 57\.
   Among other international oils, Exxon was down ~ at 45[; Chevron
1{ at 61{; Mobil ~ to 55}, and Amoco ] at 47~.
   Elsewhere, Consolidated Freightways fell 2} to 27|. The company
said its results for the fourth quarter would be around the
break-even point, or possibly a loss.
   One exception to the overall trend was Walt Disney, up 1| at
124{ on higher quarterly earnings.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included Procter &amp;
Gamble, down 2{ at 126|; Coca-Cola, down } at 73}; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down | at 43|; General Electric, down \ at
54\, and International Paper, down { at 47[.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $9.39 billion, or 0.28
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .73 to 186.75.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.92 to 383.22, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.57 at 336.58.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged
up .02 to 454.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 370.41, down .31.

<HEAD>Money Supply Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply were mixed in the week ended Oct. 30, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose by $3.1 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,181.1 billion from a revised $3,178.0
billion the previous week.
   But an even broader measure, M3, fell $700 million to a
seasonally adjusted $4,033.2 billion from $4,033.9 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell $2.2 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $786.6 billion from $788.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 over the past 52 weeks has been 4.0
percent, which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7
percent. The growth rate in M3 over the same period has been 4.0
percent, also within the Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5
percent. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early
1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,156.3 billion, an 8.2
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,017.3 billion, up 4.0 percent, while M1
rose 4.5 percent to an average of $782.3 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $186 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$289 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $293.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Nov. 1, down from $293.7 billion two weeks earlier.

<TEXT>
   Copper prices continued their surge Thursday on New York's
Commodity Exchange amid investors' concerns over labor conditions
in Chile.
   On other markets, grain was mostly lower and soybeans higher;
energy and sugar futures were higher; gold was off while silver
gained and livestock and pork futures were mixed.
   Copper settled .70 cent to 1.35 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in November at $1.1640 a pound.
   Miners at Chile's four largest mines have voted to strike if the
government adopts a law that would reorganize state-owned Chile
Copper Corp. The proposal would give members of the military
government power over mine operations after the government leaves
office and reduce the power of unions.
   Helping to boost prices was the perception the metal had been
oversold in recent weeks because of settlement of labor disputes in
Canada and Mexico, said analyst Don Tierney of Stanley Bell &amp; Co.
in New York.
   Expectations that Monday's report on stocks in London Metal
Exchange-approved warehouses will show a decline also helped
prices, as did prospects that interest rates are going down, which
would increase demand, Tierney said.
   Grain futures were mostly lower and soybeans were higher in
quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading in corn and soybeans was subdued as investors awaited
the release of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's latest crop
report.
   The report, released after the close of trading, estimated the
1989 corn harvest at 7.59 billion bushels, up 54 percent from last
year's drought-shriveled crop. The estimate was up 2 percent from
prospects a month ago when the department estimated this year's
production at 7.45 billion bushels.
   Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable
oil, was estimated at 1.94 billion bushels, up 25 percent from last
year's harvest of 1.54 billion bushels and 1 percent above the
October estimate of 1.93 billion bushels.
   Wheat prices were forced lower due to a lack of export business,
although some support was received from the National Weather
Service's six- to 10-day forecast, which calls for dry weather in
winter wheat crop areas.
   Wheat was a { cent to 1{ cent lower with December at $4.03\ a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to } cent higher with December at
$2.36{ a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1\ cent higher with December
at $1.42{ a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 4} cents higher with
November at $5.67} a bushel.
   Precious metals futures were mixed in active trading on the
Comex as investors in gold decided to take profits and invest in
silver.
   Over the past three days, gold increased in value by $10, and a
correction was overdue, said Tierney.
   He noted that silver has had minor changes in value, trading up
or down in a minor range until Thursday when traders bailed out of
gold and bought silver in the expectation its price would go up.
   Gold settled $1.80 lower with December at $389 a troy ounce;
silver was 1.3 cents to 1.7 cents higher with December at $5.308 a
troy ounce.
   Sugar prices rose on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange
on technical factors and continued concern that Brazil will not
meet its export obligations.
   Prices also were boosted by reports the United States may
increase its import quotas, which would be a boost to the world
market, said analyst Kim Badenhop of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
Inc. in New York.
   Sugar was .16 cent to .21 cent higher with January at 15.01
cents a pound.
   Energy futures climbed on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 5 cents to 20 cents higher
with December at $19.92 a barrel; heating oil was .20 cent to .50
cent higher with December at 58.92 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.35 cent to .71 cent higher with December at 52.22 a gallon.
   Livestock prices were up and pork futures were lower on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle was .13 cent to .35 cent higher with December at
74.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .40 cent higher
with November at 83.17 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .30
cent lower with December at 47.52 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .30 cent to 1.30 cent lower with February at 63.17
cents a pound.

   PacifiCorp president A.M. Gleason shrugs
off the suggestion that his company's $1.7 billion bid for Arizona
Public Service Co. reflects an aggressive campaign to acquire
electric utilities across the West.
   ``I guess we don't consider ourselves aggressive. We consider
ourselves people who are willing to act on logical opportunities,''
Gleason said Thursday, a day PacifiCorp offered to buy Arizona's
largest utility from troubled Pinnacle West Capital Corp.
   PacifiCorp, the parent company of Pacific Power and Utah Power,
already is the third-largest utility in the West, serving 1.2
million electric customers in seven Western states.
   Acquisition of Arizona Public Service would give it some 1.8
million electric customers in eight states and annual revenue from
electrical operations of about $3.6 billion.
   PacifiCorp still would fall far short of the electric revenue
generated by the West's two largest utilities, Southern California
Edison Co. of Rosemead, Calif., and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. of
San Francisco.
   The move to acquire Arizona Public Service comes less than a
year after PacifiCorp's successful 17-month campaign to acquire
Utah Power. It is the latest in a long line of carefully considered
acquisitions that have built PacifiCorp into a $3.5 billion company
over the last 35 years.
   With the acquisition of Utah Power, PacifiCorp doubled its
electrical revenues and customer base, pushing earnings from
electrical operations to 73 percent of its $3.5 billion overall
revenue. The balance of PacifiCorp's earnings come from NERCO Inc.,
a mining and development company; Pacific Telecom Inc., a telephone
company; and PacifiCorp Financial Services Inc.
   Profitable Arizona Public Service attracted the attention of
PacifiCorp executives when Pinnacle West announced it might file
for bankruptcy because of losses from its MeraBank subsidiary.
   In announcing the cash offer, Gleason said acquisition of
Arizona Public Service would broaden the benefits realized by
customers and shareholders in the acquisition of Utah Power.
   Pacific Power would furnish power to meet peak demand in the
summer in the Southwest and Arizona Public Service would do the
same in the winter, when demand peaks in the Northwest, Gleason
said.
   With the cost of constructing new power plants sky high, he
said, the deal would create the equivalent of a major generating
plant.
   PacifiCorp's history of acquisition and diversification dates to
1954, when Pacific Power &amp; Light Co.'s president Paul B. McKee
engineered the acquisition of Mountain States Power Co. The deal
gave Pacific Power more customers in Western Oregon outside the
Portland area, along with new customers in Montana and northern
Idaho.
   In 1961, a merger with California Oregon Power Co. doubled
Pacific Power's electrical business again.
   Meanwhile, the company built a business from the two small
telephone companies it acquired along with Mountain States.
   ``What we did in the area of diversification was not set out to
diversify, but rather we took assets that we had within the
enterprise and built on them,'' Gleason said.
   ``In the 1954 electric merger we acquired two small telephone
properties. We used them as the growth vehicle to build Pacific
Telecom.
   ``By the mid-'70s,'' he said, ``we had made coal sales from our
coal holdings which we originally acquired for power plant
purposes. We ended up with more proven reserves than we needed for
power plant purposes, so we started selling coal. So NERCO then
grew out of that coal sales activity and our ability to mine coal
for our own purposes.''
   PacifiCorp relies on coal for 65 percent of its electrical
generating capacity, with hydroelectric power providing 15 percent.
A merger with Arizona Public Service would reduce PacfiCorp's
dependence on coal and hydroelectric power, but increase its
reliance on nuclear power from about 0.3 percent to nearly 10
percent.
   The deal also would position PacifiCorp to serve lucrative
markets in the Southwest, said Arnold Belosic, an analyst with
Bear, Stearns Cos. Inc. in New York.
   Belosic said the key to success in electric utilities is
expanding generating capacity without spending enormous amounts of
money on new plant construction.
   PacifiCorp simply sees the Arizona Public Service deal as an
opportunity the company could not pass up, Gleason said.
   ``It developed, we felt it had value, so we reacted,'' he said.

   Braniff Inc. may reactivate some of the
beleagured carrier's grounded fleet while continuing to seek a
buyer, a company official said Thursday.
   A skeletal group of executives are considering expanding the
Orlando-based carrier's charter services, leasing some of its
aircraft or establishing some kind of maintenance operation, said
Tom Volz, senior vice president for marketing.
   ``We're formulating a realistic business plan,'' said Volz.
   Braniff dismissed most of its remaining 1,800 employees after
shutting down its 46 daily flight schedule shortly after midnight
Monday.
   After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sept. 28, the
carrier drastically cut back flights and laid off nearly 2,900
workers.
   Volz said 200 to 300 employees were still working Thursday,
including some 50 administrative people in Orlando and more than
150 in an accounting department in Dallas, the carrier's former
headquarters.
   Braniff Chairman William G. McGee and Chief Financial Officer W.
Howard Mackinnon have been trying to negotiate a possible $100
million sale to investors led by securities expert John Latshaw of
Kansas City. Company officials Thursday declined to give the
progress of the talks.
   ``There seems to be continued interest,'' said Volz.
   He said he had ``no knowledge at this time of any other action''
on a possible buyout or other short-term operations plan.
   Braniff, which was losing about $1.5 million a week before
filing for bankruptcy, already operates charters out of the
Bahamas, Salt Lake City and Dallas.
   Company officials are also trying to determine its work force
needs, Volz said.
   ``We hope to have some answers by early next week on those
questions,'' he said.

<HEAD>IMF Director Optimistic About Mexico Debt, Urges Faith in Brady Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The managing director of the International
Monetary Fund said Thursday he is optimistic about Mexico's ability
to pay some of its debt, mainly because of his faith in the program
under which the size of the country's debt is being reduced.
   Michel Camdessus said the so-called Brady plan to reduce the
debt of Third World nations is working, albeit slowly.
   For Mexico, a committee representing more than 400 banks was
formed to deal with $52 billion of that country's debt. The banks
were given a choice of reducing the total, reducing interest rates,
making new loans or some combination of the three.
   ``As far as Mexico is concerned, I am optimistic of their
ability,'' Camdessus told reporters. ``Not only because the answer
of the banks is positive in general, but because the program is so
high-quality and because the program is being implemented
thoughtfully.''
   Camdessus, who was visiting Atlanta to speak at a private dinner
held by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and to meet with former
President Jimmy Carter, defended the debt reduction program devised
by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and urged critics to
give it time to work.
   ``I think the Brady plan is an extremely important and positive
part of the debt strategy,'' he said. ``It is just starting
working. It remains to be seen if it will be a full success or a
partial one.
   ``What I have seen so far is quite encouraging,'' said
Camdessus, whose organization is funded by 152 industrialized
nations.
   For the strategy to work, he said, it will take full cooperation
from commercial banks, creditor countries and the IMF.
   Camdessus said he was opposed to tinkering with the Brady plan,
and disagreed with a banking group that on Wednesday called on
creditor governments to reduce debts owed them by ``middle income''
debtor nations.
   Horst Schulmann, head of the Institute of International Finance,
said creditor governments should negotiate delays in repayments of
loans owed to them, stretching them out beyond 10 years.
   Schulmann, whose organization represents 150 banks in the United
States, Japan and Western Europe, said such help has been given to
the poorest nations, and now should be extended to others.
   Said Camdessus: ``I'm not in favor of a permanent process of
change of the strategy. I understand very well the very good
intention and probably the good analytical reasons of Mr. Schulmann.
   ``But we have just launched a few months ago the Brady strategy.
We're just in the process of implementing that.''
   To rethink that strategy now, he said, would be ``the most
efficient way of organizing its failure.''
   In remarks prepared for his Thursday night speech, Camdessus
stressed the importance of reducing U.S. inflation and increasing
the nation's savings rate.
   ``The world economy can only take full advantage of the
increased sense of international responsibility among major
industrial countries if the United States maintains its commitment
to play its part in fostering conditions favorable to worldwide
economic prosperity,'' he said.

$29.9 million in its third fiscal quarter, citing higher interest
expenses associated with the privatization of the carrier last year
and higher operating costs.
   TWA, which is owned by takeover specialist Carl Icahn and based
in this New York suburb, said its loss for the three months ended
Sept. 30 contrasted with a profit of $88 million for the quarter a
year earlier.
   The results a year ago included a one-time gain of an
unspecified amount from litigation between TWA and the estate of
the late Howard Hughes, a previous owner. The latest figures fail
to reflect about $98 million in unrealized gains in TWA's
investment portfolio, the airline said.
   Revenue in the quarter was virually unchanged at $1.27 billion.
   The nation's sixth-largest carrier said its operating profit
tumbled to $60.7 million in the latest quarter from $141 million a
year earlier.
   It said its operating expenses climbed to $1.21 billion from
$1.13 billion because of the expiration of concessions previously
granted by the Machinists union, general salary increases, fuel
price increases and increased costs due to improvements in
trans-Atlantic service.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, TWA said it lost
$117.3 million in contrast to a profit of $132.7 million a year
earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 4 percent to $3.48 billion from $3.33
billion a year earlier.
   Though TWA is privately owned, it reports its earnings because
it has publicly traded bonds.

<HEAD>Grundfest Leaving SEC for Stanford Law School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph A. Grundfest, a member of the
Securities and Exchange Commission since 1985, announced Thursday
he was leaving the agency by early next year.
   Grundfest, in a letter to President Bush that was dated
Wednesday but disclosed Thursday, said he planned to leave
government service ``no later than Jan. 31'' to join the faculty at
Stanford University.
   The SEC is a five-member board that oversees securities markets,
regulates the sale of stocks, bonds and stock options, and enforces
securities laws.
   Grundfest is the third member of the five-member SEC to announce
his resignation this year.
   Former SEC Chairman David S. Ruder left in September to return
to teaching law at Northwestern University. Charles C. Cox also
stepped down in September to take a job with a Chicago consulting
firm.
   Richard Breeden, a former top White House aide, was nominated by
President Bush as Cox's numerical replacement and was designated
chairman after he was sworn in Oct. 11.
   Mary L. Schapiro, serving on the commission since December 1988
as a recess appointment by then-President Ronald Reagan, was
nominated Wednesday by Bush for a full five-year term. SEC
nominations require Senate confirmation.
   There will be another vacancy to fill after Grundfest leaves.

<HEAD>Allegheny International Scraps Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. on Thursday
scrapped its latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection after
Wells Fargo Bank withdrew its commitment to provide $400 million in
financing.
   The small-appliance maker said at a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court it would revert to a previously filed backup plan that would
repay virtually all creditors in new stock.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Joseph L. Cosetti pledged to force lawyers
to work through the weekend to get an amended form of the stock
plan ready for a vote by creditors even if no alternative source of
bank financing can be found quickly.
   Meanwhile, The Pittsburgh Press reported Thursday that a group
that reportedly included shaving king Victor Kiam has offered to
buy Allegheny for $683.8 million.
   Kiam would become the new chief executive under the proposal
made by Japonica Partners, a New York investment firm, sources
familiar with the deal told The Press.
   Japonica made an offer for Allegheny in July and put more
substance behind the bid Wednesday in a letter to Allegheny's
board. The July offer gave no indication of how the bid would be
financed or how the reorganized company would be operated.
   At Thursday's hearing, lawyers for Allegheny and its major
creditors said they did not put much credence in the Japonica
proposal. Bruce McCullough, a lawyer for Allegheny, said the
company's board is ``not going to waste a lot of time on it.''
   Cosetti called Japonica's offer ``almost impertinent'' and said
it would not hold up consideration of management's newest plan.
   The skepticism stems from doubts about whether Japonica could
raise the money it says it is willing to pay for Allegheny.
   Japonica made its offer in conjunction with Steinhardt Partners,
a New York money management firm. Japonica said it was confident of
lining up financing from several banks, none of which was
identified.
   Japonica contended its bid is more sensibly financed than
Allegheny management's plan. All but $53 million of the $683.8
million price would be paid in cash. Unlike Allegheny's latest
plan, Japonica's would not use high-yield, high-risk debt
securities known as junk bonds.
   On a different front, Kiam, Remington Products' president and
pitchman, has recently worked on a possible bid for Allegheny in
conjunction with the equity committee in the company's bankruptcy
case. That effort is not related to Japonica's offer, according to
Gary Blu, the lead lawyer for the equity committee.
   Kiam was out of town Thursday and not immediately available for
comment, his secretary said.
   Wells Fargo previously expressed concern that the management
plan contained too little equity, but it had given no indication it
would withdraw its financing.
   Allegheny has been operating under Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy
protection since February 1988.
   Last month it filed two alternate plans to emerge from
bankruptcy. The company has filed several plans in its efforts to
reorganize but has met consistent opposition from creditors and
shareholders. Its debts currently total about $500 million.

<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. said Thursday it
agreed to sell its Ticketron Sports &amp; Entertainment division to the
Carlyle Group, a private merchant banking firm based in Washington,
D.C.
   Terms were not disclosed.
   Control Data said it will retain its Automated Wagering Services
operation, which supplies on-line wagering systems to state
lotteries and off-track betting jurisdictions. The operation was
formerly part of Ticketron.
   Ticketron is the nation's oldest computerized ticketing service
company. Last year, Ticketron sold over 19 million tickets
generating about $450 million in gross ticket receipts and $41.4
million in revenue, while breaking even for Control Data.
   ``Carlyle's strengths will build on Ticketron's solid market
presence and reputation for customer service and make it an even
stronger competitor,'' said Lawrence Perlman, president and chief
operating officer of Control Data. ``The sale allows Control Data
to focus more resources on the growth of its Automated Wagering
Services operation and other businesses.''
   Carlyle is owned by the Richard King Mellon family and by the
Carlyle managing directors, which include Frank Carlucci, former
U.S. defense secretary.
   Earlier this year, Carlyle led an investor partnership that
bought Coldwell Banker Commercial Group from Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
   The Ticketron sale is expected to be completed in 30 days.

<HEAD>Red Cross Cancels Blood Drive at Eastern Airlines After Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross canceled a blood drive
last month for non-striking Eastern Airlines employees after,
officials said, union members threatened to halt future donations.
   Mary Ackerly, director of the Red Cross corporate communications
in Atlanta, said the organization canceled its Oct. 27 blood drive
at Eastern's reservations office in Marietta after union officials
urged them not to cross picket lines.
   She said 50 units of blood were expected to be collected during
the drive.
   ``We were told (by AFL-CIO officials) that if we went ahead with
the drive we could expect further problems from other unions,'' she
said.
   ``Faced with the potential of such a significant loss of its
donor base, the Red Cross decided to cancel the blood drive,'' she
said.
   Ms. Ackerly said union workers donate 40,000 units of blood or
one-fifth of all blood donations to the Red Cross' 82-county region
in Georgia and parts of Alabama.
   Richard Ray, president of the Atlanta Labor Council of the
Georgia AFL-CIO, said he asked Red Cross officials last month to
stop the blood drive.
   Ray said union organizers would not have objected to
non-striking Eastern workers donating at the Red Cross office ``on
neutral ground.''
   ``We are in no way trying to keep anyone from giving blood to
the Red Cross,'' he said.
   Eastern workers have been on strike since March, sending the
company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.

<HEAD>Former Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker Says No Recession Ahead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Volcker, former chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, said he doesn't foresee a recession in the
near future, but warned that Americans should re-examine their
habits of overspending and dependence on foreign capital.
   Volcker, who oversaw the nation's monetary policy under the
Carter and Reagan administrations, pointed to the recent Japanese
acquisitions of Columbia Pictures and Firestone Tire as warning
signals.
   ``Japan has been lending us a lot of money and buying a lot of
our companies,'' Volcker said. ``It has financed a large part of
our deficit. It has also permitted our consumption to proceed.''
   Volcker, now chairman of the James T. Wolfensohn investment
banking firm, was in Birmingham to speak at Birmingham-Southern
College.
   Volcker said the nation's economy will likely continue its
current seven-year expansion, the longest peacetime growth period.
He noted that the unemployment rate has hit a 15-year low, prices
are stable and inflation is remaining steady at about 4 percent.
   ``The chances are good, in fact, that we will avoid a recession
in the next year, and if we play our cards right, we may have an
expansion for years to come,'' Volcker said.
   Despite his optimistic forecast, the former policy-maker warned
that the economy's built-in risks _ the federal and trade deficits,
reliance on foreign capital and a low savings rate _ continue to
threaten growth.
   Volcker said the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, was a sign
of problems in the economic system but that investors did not heed
the warning and continue to shrug off the twin deficits.
   With a higher savings rate, Americans could finance more of the
economy themselves, he said.
   ``There are more risks than usual in our economy,'' he said.
``They are pretty well known.''

   Star Tribune newsroom employees approved a
six-year contract Wednesday night, hours after their second strike
deadline in as many days, but union leaders could find little
positive to say about the deal.
   Guild Chairwoman Margaret Zack said the vote was 233-70.
   A lack of support from other unions at plant helped spur the
reluctant membership to accept the contract after several hours of
discussion, union leaders said.
   ``It's a bad deal. It's a rotten deal,'' said Jay Weiner, vice
chairman of the negotiating committee. But Guild members feared
they would be replaced in a prolonged strike, he said.
   ``We could have struck, but without the other unions it would
have been extremely difficult,'' said strike coordinator Steve
Brandt, who characterized the contract as ``punitive.''
   ``It simply doesn't meet the needs of people trying to keep
their standard of living intact,'' he said.
   Star Tribune spokeswoman Bette Fenton said the newspaper was
``back to work as usual.''
   ``We had hoped from the very beginning that we were able to
reach a fair and equitable settlement and we're pleased that we've
done that,'' she said.
   Brandt said the contract covers six years and includes bonuses
in each of the first three years, and pay raises of 3.2 percent in
the fourth year, 3.1 percent in the fifth year and 3.0 percent in
the sixth year.
   For top scale reporters, photographers, copy editors and
district circulation managers, the bonuses would be $2,000 in the
first year, $1,750 in the second and $1,500 in the third, Brandt
said.
   The pay raises for top-scale employees would amount to about $26
a week in each of the last three years, he said. Weiner said the
package averages out to a 1.6 percent annual increase in pay scales
over six years. He called it ``worse by far'' than the recent deal
struck by Guild employees at the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch.
   Supervisors worked on scaled-down editions of Thursday's paper
until union members returned at about 10:15 p.m., Brandt said.
   The union's original strike deadline was 4 p.m. Tuesday, but
that was extended to 4 p.m. Wednesday. As the deadline passed,
union negotiators said they were waiting for the company's response
to a new offer they had made.
   Other provisions of the tentative pact as described by Brandt
include:
   _Six employees would be removed from Guild jurisdiction, rather
than the 26 originally proposed by the company.
   _Mileage would increase 1 cent a mile, to 22 cents; the Guild
had sought an increase to 28 cents.
   Union members have been working without a contract since their
three-year pact expired July 31. The Minneapolis unit covers about
300 newsroom employees and about 60 circulation and promotion
workers.
   Under the old contract, top minimum weekly salaries for Star
Tribune Guild members have been $315.50 for copy aides; $742.50 for
circulation district managers; $812 for reporters, photographers,
copy editors and promotion personnel; and $895.75 for some editors,
the Guild said.
