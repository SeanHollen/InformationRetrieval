   The Navy has equipment capable of recovering the
cargo door that sank in 16,800 feet of water after tearing away from
a United Airlines jumbo jet, an undersea technician said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has not decided whether
to attempt to recover the door from the Pacific Ocean 85 miles
southwest of Honolulu, said member Lee Dickinson. He said, however,
that examining the front cargo door would be ``very helpful to us in
our analysis.''
   Navy radar tracked a large object falling into the ocean about 45
seconds after the pilot of United's Flight 811 reported an in-flight
emergency early Friday soon after taking off for Auckland, New
Zealand, Dickinson said Tuesday night.
   Investigators suspect the cargo door popped open at 22,000 feet,
tearing away with a large section of fuselage. Nine passengers
seated on the right side of the Boeing 747 jet were swept to their
deaths.
   The first lawsuits stemming from the accident were filed here
Wednesday.
   Mae S. Sapolu, a United flight attendant from Honolulu, filed a
state court lawsuit seeking unspecified damages from Boeing Co.,
maker of the jumbo jet.
   According to court documents, Sapolu was serving drinks in
business class when the hole opened in the right side of the
aircraft. Sapolu said she was thrown to the floor and had to cling
to the leg of a seat to keep from being swept out of the plane.
   Edwin Geoffrey Tudor a passenger from New South Wales, Australia,
also sought unspecified damages in his lawsuit filed in U.S.
District Court, accusing from United and Boeing of neglect in
maintaining the Boeing 747.
   Sapolu and Tudor said they suffered physical injuries and
emotional distress.
   Capt. David M. Cronin turned the crippled jet around and flew it
100 miles on two of four engines, landing safely at Honolulu
International Airport.
   ``The radar picked up something that could be a large piece of
metal, possibly the cargo door,'' Dickinson said.
   ``That information is going back to Washington, D.C., to see if
we can indeed determine ... that was the cargo door, and its exact
location.''
   ``We have the location at the surface of the water,'' he said.
``You're talking about three miles (down), one can only guess where
that is.''
   Paul Wolcott, a technician and submersible launch pilot at the
University of Hawaii's Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory, said it
would be difficult but probably not impossible to find the cargo
door.
   A search for the door probably would begin with a towed
underwater sonar sled to determine possible locations of the door
and then the use of a remote operation vehicle equipped with a
camera to pinpoint the location, Wolcott said Wednesday.
   The Navy has ROVs capable of hooking a line to the door so it
could be pulled to the surface, he said.
   The least likely possibility because of the tremendous expense
involved would be the use of the Navy's San Diego-based Sea Cliff,
one of the world's few manned submersibles capable of reaching that
depth, Wollcott said.
   Dickinson said the NTSB's field work was nearly completed and
investigators would leave Hawaii by Thursday.
   Jim Guyette, United's executive vice president for operations,
said the damaged jetliner will be repaired, although there was no
estimate on when it will be returned to service.
   The air frame will be fixed in Hawaii and the engines will be
repaired in San Francisco, Guyette told a news conference here
Wednesday.
   About 10 of the passengers who were on Flight 811 remain in
Hawaii as well as a few survivors of the missing and United is
paying all expenses, Guyette said.
   Two United flight attendants are the only ones on the plane who
remain hospitalized.

   Gaining weight accompanies gaining office
for many members of the General Assembly.
   Lunches with lobbyists, snacks during committee meetings and
rounds of receptions and late-night dinners at the state capital's
leading restaurants make staying thin as tough as _ and sometimes
tougher _ than getting re-elected.
   Just talk to Delegates Gene W. Counihan, Elijah E. Cummings,
Howard P. Rawlings, and William R. McCaffrey.
   The foursome top the scales at 1,200 pounds collectively and, in
a well-publicized weigh-in, they vowed to lose weight by the end of
the assembly's 90-day session.
   ``There are just too many opportunities for too much eating,''
said Counihan, who put on 25 pounds during his first year in
Annapolis six years ago and has steadily gained since then.
   Delegate Richard A. Palumbo, who picked up a few pounds each
session until he hit 200, said he understood his problem graphically
when he started looking at photographs taken during his Annapolis
career: ``Me getting fatter and fatter and fatter.''
   ``It's hard. There is food everywhere,'' Palumbo said. ``You go
to a reception and you are talking with someone about something
important to them. They have a drink in their hand, you have a
drink. They are plucking shrimp off a shrimp tree, so you pluck
some, too. ... You end up eating both sides of an issue.''

   Wildlife specialist Peter T. Bromley has a
way to get rid of mosquitoes in the yard: put up a bat house, which
is similar to a bird house except it attracts a different type of
winged occupant.
   ``A bat might eat up 2,000 mosquitoes every night,'' said Bromley
of the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service at Virginia Tech. ``If
you have six or seven bats in your house, that's more than 10,000
mosquitoes.''
   Besides, a bat house can be entertaining for homeowners, Bromley
said.
   ``On a summer night, you just have to get a lawn chair, sit it
outside and wait to see if a bat flits out the bat house,'' Bromley
said.
   ``They're great fliers, so they have aesthetic appeal. Plus, it's
fun to have guests look at your bat house and say, `There's no hole
in the front.' Then you can say, `That's a bat house,' and have a
lot of fun talking about it around your place.''
   Virginia Tech said people can get free plans for a bat house by
sending in a self-addressed, stamped envelope. But so far, the
Extension Service has not been going bats answering requests: it
hasn't received any inquiries yet.

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law that lets voters pick ``none of
these candidates'' would be erased under a proposal by a state
assemblywoman who says the option made Nevada ``the laughingstock of
the United States.''
   Assemblywoman Eileen Brookman on Tuesday asked the Assembly
Elections Committee to amend a bill she has introduced to repeal the
option.
   During the 1986 Democratic primary for state treasurer, ``none of
these candidates'' got more votes than five hopefuls. However, the
``none'' voting is advisory only, and doesn't stop a person from
winning a race.
   ``I think we are the laughingstock of the United States because
of this,'' she said. ``I'd like to have this amended and the law
repealed.''
   The 1975 Legislature created the option. Sen. Don Mello, who
introduced the original bill then as an assemblyman, said the
category was intended to boost voter turnout.

<TEXT>
   Volleyball and bowling leagues, two big
attractions this time of year in northern Iowa, will play second
fiddle tonight to NBC-TV's ``Late Night With David Letterman.''
   Letterman's show will feature the town of Bolan _ all 16
residents.
   ``I don't think there's anybody in Worth County that won't be
watching it,'' said Diane VanHorn, a secretary in the county
sheriff's department.
   At JJ's tavern in Northwood, home of about 2,000 people, Larry
and Judy Jorgensen are planning a ``Bolan Bonus'' night, featuring a
``Bolan cocktail'' and a ``Bolan burrito.''
   ``We were going to promote Wednesday night as `Northwood _ the
suburb of Bolan,'' Jorgensen said.
   Mrs. Jorgensen said the usual crowd that comes to her place after
volleyball and bowling leagues will likely stay a little longer to
watch ``Late Night'' on the color TV above the bar.
   ``If I had any influence with those people in New York, I'd have
them put the Bolan people on at the very end of the show so
everybody will stay longer,'' she said.
   Area residents are proud of the Bolanites, who will be seated
together in the ``Late Night'' audience before being introduced. One
or two will be on stage with Letterman.
   The show and all the national attention has given the little town
a big-city attitude.
   Bolan residents have arranged for friends to stay at each of
their homes, and they've hired additional security officers to
protect their belongings while they are being wined and dined in New
York.
   Sheriff Chuck Storffregen's deputies also will patrol the town at
all hours until the homeowners return.

   Four young daughters of a poor factory
worker swallowed rat poison in a suicide attempt aimed at easing the
family's economic plight and enabling their brother to get an
education, police said today.
   The youngest girl, 6, died. The others, aged 8, 10 and 13, were
in serious condition.
   Their mother, Kim Ok-soon, found the girls in the family's rented
two-room apartment when she returned from grocery shopping Monday.
Their 3-year-old brother was nearby _ unharmed.
   Police said the eldest daughter, Soon-mi, 13, regained
consciousness and told police the sisters decided to kill themselves
because it would leave more money for the parents and for education
expenses to raise their brother.
   Seoul newspapers quoted the girls' teachers as saying they
studied hard and were quiet, model students. But a neighborhood
store owner said Soon-mi recently told him she could not afford
$5.80 worth of notebooks and pencils she needed for school and asked
to pay later.
   The father, Yang Tae-bum, 44, supported the family of seven on
$362 a month in factory wages, police said.

<HEAD>Walls To Go Up In Warsaw For Uncensored Graffiti</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Graffiti has become such a scourge in
Warsaw that city authorities intend to erect walls where people can
scrawl whatever they please without fear of censorship, a spokesman
for the mayor says.
   In Poland, graffiti usually carries a political message and is
most often quickly painted over by authorities with dull hues that
accentuate the eyesore.
   Graffiti and other vandalism cost the city more than $1.8 million
last year, and slogans scrawled during a ``happening'' Friday near
Warsaw's main department store caused $9,000 in damage, authorities
say.
   Municipal officials decided Monday to build the free-speech
graffiti walls at locations still to be decided, said Zbigniew
Kopka, the mayor's spokesman.
   ``Everyone will have a chance to express themselves, if only the
paint is no longer sprayed on the walls of our buildings or
underground passageways,'' he said Tuesday.
   Scrawling on walls has a long tradition in Poland.
   A cross-and-anchor symboly with the initials ``PW'' for ``Poland
is Fighting,'' became a national symbol of resistance during World
War II.

   Call it toothy gold, a get-rich quick plan for
an area devastated by the crash of the oil market.
   Across Louisiana's marshes, once flush with profits from black
gold, small patches of land increasingly are being turned into
alligator farms, with investors hoping to quintuple their
investments in short order.
   ``Year before last, there were just under 9,000 farm-raised
gators sold'' by 37 farms, said Dave Taylor, alligator research
coordinator for Louisiana's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.
``That number is going to reach 60,000 quickly and could be up to
100,000, certainly, within five years.''
   That's in addition to the 24,000 wild alligators trapped each
fall in carefully supervised hunts.
   Spurred by prices of $37 a linear foot for hides, 21 new farms
have opened in the past two years, and ``We expect them to produce
18,000 gators,'' Taylor said. The waiting list for permits for new
farms is about 100.
   Jerry Jones Jr., 28, went into business two years ago near
Sweetlake and expects to put 12,000 hides a year on the market. His
farm is state-of-the-art: automated cleaning, water-source heat
pumps, carefully supervised diets.
   The result is quicker growth at less cost. ``We have some are 5-6
feet long in a year and six months. We have 8-month-old gators that
are 26-30 inches.''
   Skins of wild alligators average seven feet in length, and are
used for luggage. Farm-raised gators are skinned at two years old
and about four feet long. Their hides are used for shoes, purses,
belts and other smaller high-fashion accoutrements requiring smaller
patterns on the hides.
   For about $30,000 a potential farmer can put up a couple
windowless cinder-block buildings on concrete slabs and be ready to
raise 1,000 gators a year. It would take another $25,000 to $30,000
to operate until the gators grew enough to sell. At current prices,
1,000 four-foot hides would bring $148,000.
   ``The minimum requirements are 1 square foot per alligator up to
two feet in length and 2 square feet up to four feet in length,''
Taylor said. Buildings must be able to hold a few inches of water
and be kept about 89 degrees.
   The first thing is to gather alligator eggs from wild nests,
paying landowners for the eggs and committing 17 percent of the
hatch for return to the wild at 4 feet long. That's a carefully
researched percentage designed for zero growth in the population of
1.5 million wild alligators _ reached after the alligator was taken
off the endangered species list in the mid-1970s.
   The wild nests aren't easy to find, and female alligators guard
their eggs _ about the only time in their lives they show maternal
instincts.
   No task for the timid, Taylor agreed. ``But everybody's got to
learn some time or another, if they want to get into farming.
   ``Obviously, what would be best, for a guy's first involvement,
would be to hire someone with a little experience in locating nests
from the air. That's the only way to go: rent a helicopter and go
find them and pick them up.''
   The success of farming ventures will almost certainly drive
prices down, and there are risks any time a market depends on
fashion or something volatile, he said. ``I don't think the bottom
will fall out of the price. I don't think they'll go to $2 a foot.
But it certainly could go to half of what it is now.''
   Jones, a former trapper, commercial diver and underwater welder
who now devotes full time to his farm, agrees with Taylor's
analysis. ``A lot of these farms, you'll see what happens. Prices
are good right now, but with all these hides coming on the market,
it's going to have to go down.''
   But Jones believes he will survive when others fail because his
expenses are low. ``Look at it this way, you've got an electricity
bill of $500 a month to raise 1,000 alligators, and my bill is $150
a month to raise 12,000.''
   His major problem is finding enough nutria _ small water rodents
_ to feed the gators. Nutria often are dyed like beaver, and Jones
said, ``The price of skins is so low, right now, that you can't get
all you want. Last year I got 40,000 pounds, and I could have used
140,000.''
   He had to supplement with fish and horse, and young alligators
don't grow as quickly on that diet. In addition, too much fish gives
alligators gout.

   It appeared the French and English languages
could live together in Quebec after separatist fervor abated nearly
a decade ago, but the struggle resumed in December and French
appears to have won.
   New issues arise constantly, such as whether the inside of a bus
is really outside for sign purposes, and the answer almost every
time is that the signs must be only in French. The English-speaking
minority, although disgruntled, appears to accept that the fight is
lost.
   ``Resigned is probably the right catchword,'' said Donald Taylor,
a psychology professor at McGill University.
   Language is ``a symbol of identity and it also is a resource that
has associated power, and status, and success and access,'' he said.
``So these apparently minor events evoke very primary feelings.''
   Quebec was a battleground of culture and language in the 1970s
between the 81 percent with French heritage and a minority with a
cultural kinship to Ontario and the other English-speaking provinces.
   Power shifted to the French-speaking majority in those years but
the separatist tide ebbed after 1980, and with it the dispute over
language, when Quebec voters rejected a sovereignty referendum.
   Then came a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada in December
that a 1977 Quebec requiring all signs to be in French was
unconstitutional. The court said French could be required to
predominate on all signs but other languages could not be prohibited.
   The provincial government, which has broader powers than state
governments in the United States, overrode the decision with new
legislation for the language on signs.
   Bill 178, as it is known, requires that all outdoor signs still
be solely in French, but for the first time since 1977 allowed
bilingual indoor signs. Premier Robert Bourassa described it as a
compromise.
   Rallies by activists of both communities have accompanied the
latest round. English signs posted in the street risk being
spray-painted and a fire blamed on arson heavily damaged the offices
of Alliance Quebec, the main English-language lobby.
   Fewer street protests are held now, but the conflict continues as
regulations under Bill 178 are interpreted to restrict indoor
bilingual signs more than originally believed.
   ``It's taken 21 years, but the Quebec language war is finally
over. And the English have lost,'' political columnist Don
MacPherson wrote in Montreal's English-language daily Gazette.
   Jeff Kelly of Alliance Quebec said in an interview: ``My concern
about Bill 178 is its silliness. You don't like a law to be silly.''
   As an example, he cited the Bourassa government's determination
that the inside of a bus is really an outside location and thus not
a proper site for bilingual signs.
   ``A lot of people in both communities were spoiling for a
fight,'' Kelly said. ``The signs became symbols. Certainly the signs
themselves are not what's at play.''
   A prevailing view in Quebec is that the vigorous political fight
of the 1970s spawned a new entrepeneurial spirit in the French
community, as seen in the province's support for the new free trade
agreement with the United States.
   Business administration became the major of choice at
French-language universities. Bourassa's provincial Liberal Party
trounced the nationalist Parti Quebecois in 1985 elections.
   Many English speakers opposed to learning French left the
province and, expecially among the young, bilingualism is becoming
the norm.
   Alliance Quebec figures put the rate of bilingualism among the
English community, which is centered in Montreal, at 60 percent in
1986 compared with 37 percent in 1971.
   Until December, the issue of signs was portrayed as being no
longer controversial.
   Since then, however, English speakers have described the denial
of bilingual signs as a major violation of individual rights and the
French say the restriction is necessary to preserve their culture in
North America.
   ``The language is the essence of culture,'' said Claude Filion, a
Party Quebecois member of the Quebec legislature. ``This compromise
(Bill 178) is unacceptable to both the Francophone and the
Anglophone.''
   Filion said any relaxation of the sign law erodes French as the
main language of the province.
   ``Our position is that Mr. Bourassa should have maintained the
status quo,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet activist Andrei D. Sakharov has been told
that Russian helicopter gunships fired on their own ground troops to
prevent their capture by Afgan rebels, his son-in-law said Tuesday
night.
   In the Soviet Union, Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, who led the last
contingent of Soviet troops out of Afghanistan on Feb. 14, said the
allegation was ``monstrous.''
   Sakharov has no evidence that Soviet airmen fired on their own
soldiers, ``but he has heard it and he believes it,'' said his
son-in-law, Efrem Yankelevich.
   Yankelevich refused to allow The Associated Press to speak
directly with Sakharov, who with his wife, Yelena Bonner, is staying
with his in-laws in suburban Newton.
   ``He didn't specify from whom (he heard) this kind of
accusation,'' Yankelevich said. ``He's not the first to make these
accusations.''
   Sakharov first made the charge in an interview with a Canadian
radio station during a recent visit, according to an article in the
Soviet military newspaper Red Star.
   Gromov told the newspaper Tuesday that he had never seen a Soviet
unit attack another to prevent capture and interrogation by the
Mujahadeen rebels.
   ``I state definitely that there had not been nor could have been
facts so monstrous,'' Gromov said.
   Yankelevich responded, ``On the basis of the facts (available to
Sakharov), he has no reason to retract his statement.''
   Sakharov and Mrs. Bonner arrived in the United States from Canada
on Feb. 18 on their first such visit together. It is not known how
long their visit will last.

   Even Al Capone and Maxwell Smart were no match
for Victoria Principal in a TV movie called ``Naked Lie,'' whose
strong performance helped CBS remain out of last place for the
fourth time in five weeks.
   ``The 31st Annual Grammy Awards'' also helped CBS take second
place last week. NBC has won every week except for one tie with CBS.
Never mind that the Grammys had its lowest rating ever, 16.0, and
ranked 26th. It still did better than CBS usually does on Wednesday
nights.
   Another strong performer for CBS was a special two-hour
``Dallas'' that wound up with the highest-rated episode of the
durable night-time soap so far this season. It had a 17.9 and was
ranked 17th.
   Principal's thriller ``Naked Lie'' vanquished NBC's ``The Revenge
of Al Capone'' and ABC's reunion movie ``Get Smart, Again!'' to win
Sunday night and finish ninth in the weekly A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   Otherwise, the usual suspects rounded up the top 10: ``The Cosby
Show,'' NBC; ``A Different World,'' NBC; ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``60
Minutes,'' CBS; ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS;
``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC. NBC's ``Dear John''
finished 10th, behind ``Naked Lie.''
   NBC, which at 36 straight weeks is creeping up on CBS' record
40-week victory streak from 1962-63, won the week that ended Sunday
with an average, prime-time rating of 16.2. CBS had a 14.6. ABC had
11.7.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions.
The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   Taking the three network news anchors to Japan for Emperor
Hirohito's funeral didn't seem to produce extra ratings. The ``CBS
Evening News'' had a rating of 11.7 and a 20 share. ``ABC World News
Tonight'' had an 11.5 and 20 share. ``NBC Nightly News'' had an 11.0
and 20 share.
   The lowest-rated prime-time network shows of the week were:
``Mission Impossible,'' ``Dolphin Cove,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Almost
Grown,'' ``Beverly Hills 75th Anniversary,'' ``Great Circuses of the
World,'' ``TV 101,'' ``HeartBeat,'' ``A Fine Romance'' and
``Murphy's Law.''

<HEAD>Does Da Mayah Want Good English? You Betcha!</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If youse talk like dis and don't know nuttin'
about grammah and good English, don't let Mayah Edward I. Koch know.
Yup, you be axin' for it.
   This spring, the mayor and schools chancellor Richard Green are
beginning a program to exorcise what Green calls ``speech demons''
from the lexicons of young New Yorkers who don't know or use
standard English usage.
   ``Axe'' instead of ``ask,'' for example. And ``pitcher'' instead
of ``picture,'' ``brang'' for ``brought'' and ``meetcha'' for ``meet
you.''
   And, as Koch himself used to say, ``liberry'' instead of
``library.''
   ``It was brought to my attention that I was saying `liberry.' I
wasn't aware of it,'' Koch admitted Tuesday.
   The program grew out of Koch's conversations with some of the
nearly 1 million students in the city school system.
   ``It's New Yorkese _ it's white, Hispanic, black,'' Koch said,
responding to suggestions that the new language program was aimed at
ethnic or racial groups.
   ``The language in some cases was un-understandable,'' Koch said,
coining a word of his own.
   The mayor had asked Green to come up with a program to tackle the
problem, and last week Green outlined it for Koch and provided a
list of the most commonly mispronounced and misused words and
phrases.
   The effort starts this spring with a one-day ``Putting Your Best
Speech Forward Day,'' during which teachers in all grades will focus
on the list of speech demons. A poster contest will produce graphics
that will be circulated throughout the system.
   The long-term plan includes more debating, oral reports, public
service announcements and a booklet of classroom activities aimed at
improving English.
   All this, Green wrote, should lead to ``substantive improvement
of oral communication skills.'' (Say what? Better speaking, you
betcha).
   Koch said for young New Yorkers to compete with the best students
across the nation and get good jobs, they must be able to speak
English properly and ``at the same time maintain your own heritage
and wherever possible to learn the language of your ancestors.''
   Some linguistic experts say such ``non-standard English'' is a
kind of dialect that isn't considered incorrect in the students'
social setting.
   Professor John Mayer of New York University's English Education
Department said the effort could stigmatize some students. The
chancellor's list, he said, included many phrases used by blacks and
Hispanics.
   In his memo, Green pointed out that the program will make clear
that ``our purpose is not to devalue anyone's home language. We will
encourage students to recognize that to be successful in school and
in the workplace, they must be able to use formal English
effectively.''
   ``This has nothing to do with accents,'' Koch said, although the
list shows ``cau-nuh'' for ``corner.'' ``It has nothing to do with
diction, it has to do with syntax, grammar. And the expressions
they're going to concentrate on are effectively New Yorkese, and
they cut across economics and race and ethnicity.''

   An example of the ``speech demons'' targeted for
extinction in the New York City schools:
   ``Fred says he wasn't doin' nuttin'. So, I says to him, `I'm
goin' to da liberry, I'll meetcha there.' But he didn't know where
da liberry was at. I axe him, `Are youse foolin' round? It's like,
in midtown, you know. Pacifically, at da cau-nuh of 41st and Fifth.'
He axes me if I was on'y goin' to da liberry. No, I says. `What-cha
doin' next?' he axed. `First,' I says, `I'm goin' to da museum to
see some pitchers. Then, I'm goin' to see Lorenzo _ he be sick, and
he ain't got no food. I brang some soup for him.' I says I think
this is da right thing to do. `Yup, you betcha,' Fred says.''
   Now, the same encounter rendered in proper English.
   ``Fred said he wasn't doing anything. I told him, `I'm going to
the library. I'll meet you there.' He didn't know where the library
was. I asked him, `Are you fooling around? It's in midtown.
Specifically, it's at the corner of 41st Street and Fifth Avenue.'
He asked me if I was going only to the library. No, I said. `What
are you doing next?' he asked. `First,' I said, I'm going to the
museum to see some pictures. Then, I'm going to see Lorenzo _ he's
sick and he has no food. I brought some soup for him.' I said I
thought this was the right thing to do. `Yes, you're right,' Fred
said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Drug Smuggler To Hand Over Millions or Face An Extra
10 Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>READING, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge gave a convicted drug smuggler
this choice: hand over nearly $2.95 million or have another decade
added to your 8{-year jail sentence.
   Ronald French, 37, did not say in court Tuesday whether he would
pay up _ the law gives him a year to come up with the cash _ or
serve the extra time.
   The seizure, ordered by Judge John Murchie at Reading Crown
Court, was the heaviest so far under Britain's new Drug Trafficking
Act, which allows courts to confiscate the proceeds of illegal drug
smuggling.
   The court convicted French in August of plotting to smuggle 790
pounds of marijuana into Britain with the help of an Air France
employee.
   His sentencing was postponed until Tuesday for an inquiry into
his assets.
   During a hearing on the assets, Murchie was told of French's
various aliases, his 21 bank accounts in Switzerland and Spain and
his companies or other interests in Luxembourg, Panama, Liberia and
South Africa.
   The judge said Tuesday that he assessed French's assets from drug
smuggling at $4.3 million, with $2.95 million recoverable.

   The Merce Cunningham Dance Company opened its
season at the City Center on Tuesday with the premiere of ``Five
Stone Wind,'' and the choreographer himself was among the dancers.
   For much of this 55-minute work, the stage is full of dancers but
all are motionless except one or two. The primary motif consists of
standing on one foot while stretching, bending and rotating the
other leg.
   This is not a dance that flows. There are many entrances and
exits, from five different points. Only occasionally do dancers move
in unison or as duet partners.
   Cunningham, who will turn 70 in April, does arm stretches, bends
and turns, usually in the back of the group, once on stage alone.
One would expect him to look silly among his trim, young dancers.
But he fits the tone of the dance and makes one think about the
effectiveness of one or two more mature dancers in the bunch.
   Cunningham is inventive enough, even pursuing one choreographic
idea, to keep one interested throughout. Also, we like long dances
so the evening isn't spent mainly in intermissions between short
dances. Still, we became restless before the end.
   Costumes are leotard tops and skirts or pants, later leotards
only for the women, in varying colors chosen by Mark Lancaster. The
score was created by John Cage, Takehisa Kosugi and David Tudor and
has a few painfully loud bursts of sound.
   The first part of ``Five Stone Wind'' had its premier in Berlin
last June. The complete work bowed at the Festival d'Avignon in
France in July.
   The evening began with Cunningham's 1968 ``RainForest.'' The
company's City Center season runs through March 12, and two other
premieres are scheduled: ``Cargo X'' and ``Field and Figures.''
   The company will perform at the Leicester Festival in England
March 16 to 18, at the University of Arizona in Tempe April 1 and 2,
Kennedy Center in Washington May 1 through 7 and C.W. Post College
on Long Island May 12. During July and August the company will dance
in Italy and France.

   Art Donovan, a former Baltimore Colts
football player and perpetual jokester, tried a joke out on an
anti-abortion crowd but no one thought it funny.
   Noting that he weighed 17 pounds at birth, Donovan said, ``If
anybody should have thought about having an abortion, it was my
mother.''
   When no one laughed, Donovan, the rally's keynote speaker,
quickly turned serious, saying he was against abortion because he is
Irish Catholic and ``my church told me'' abortion is wrong.
   Thousands of demonstrators rallied Monday night at Maryland's
State House to protest legalized abortion.
   Donovan is author of a biography entitled ``Fatso'' and appears
frequently as a guest on NBC's ``Late Night with David Letterman.''

   It wasn't exactly ``God Is My Copilot,'' but
only because that seat was taken by an instructor as Archbishop
Roger Mahony took off in a $400,000 helicopter given to the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles.
   Mahony, 53, will use the helicopter to drop in on the 275
parishes in the nation's most populous Roman Catholic archdiocese,
which covers an area larger than Israel.
   ``It's part of the Southern California scene now. Traffic is
really a problem,'' said the archbishop, who took the gift out for a
spin Tuesday.
   The helicopter, blessed by the archbishop and sporting a St.
Christopher medal on the instrument panel, was donated by a group of
businessmen.
   The helicopter has generated criticism from some advocates for
the poor who say the money could have been better spent in the
archdiocese, but Mahoney said the gift won't cost the archdiocese
anything.

   Aspiring actor Rob Camilletti has pleaded no
contest to two counts of vandalism for smashing a photographer's
camera equipment outside the home of his girlfriend, Cher, a
prosecutor said.
   His attorney entered the plea Tuesday. Camilletti, a former New
York bagel maker, pizza chef and bartender, faces up to one year in
jail and a $2,000 fine when he is sentenced March 14.
   Camilletti's run-in with free-lance photographers who were
staking out Cher's home occurred last July. He was accused of trying
to run photographer Peter Brandt down in a Ferrari and damaging his
camera equipment. A prosecutor said she will move to dismiss a
reckless driving charge.
   Cher, 42, and Camilletti, 24, have been companions since meeting
at a New York nightclub on her 40th birthday.

_ his casino.
   The 1,250-room Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort _ compete with
Arabic-style domes, an amusement park and a heliport _ will be the
biggest gambling casino in the world, Trump said Tuesday.
   Trump said the Atlantic City, N.J., casino will be worth $1
billion when about 4,000 workers finish building it in early 1990.
Construction began in 1983. Trump bought the property several months
ago.
   His plans: a 3,000-seat fast food restaurant, a 5,000-car garage,
a 42-story hotel, and a sports arena with enough space to park eight
blimps.
   ``I want people to walk in and freak out,'' he said.

Abdul-Jabbar told police the tourist was bothering him.
   Judge John L. Wiehn on Tuesday set sentencing for March 29.
Abdul-Jabbar could be fined up to $1,750, sentenced to 10 months in

   Konrad Lorenz, the world-renowned
scientist and author who won a Nobel prize for his pioneering work
in the field of human and animal behavior, has died at age 85, the
Academy of Sciences said Tuesday.
   Lorenz, who died of kidney failure Monday night, was famous both
for his research and for the best-selling works on behavior that won
him a worldwide reputation as a great humanist.
   Among his best-known books is ``On Aggression.''
   In 1973, Lorenz' behavioral research won him the Nobel Prize for
Medicine along with the scientists Karl von Frisch and Nikolaas
Tinbergen.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said Tuesday the nation had lost a
``pioneering researcher and a humanistic thinker.''
   In science, Lorenz was known above all for his discovery of a
process known as imprinting, or the rapid and almost irreversible
learning process that occurs in early childhood, bonding animals to
their biological mothers.
   But he showed the process could be changed, demonstrating that
mallard ducklings, for example, would happily follow a human who
greeted them shortly after birth and imitated quacking.
   To millions, Lorenz was famed as the ``father of the gray
geese,'' a man whose detailed studies of geese and other birds and
animals led him to some penetrating and often gloomy conclusions
about humanity and its future.
   His most controversial findings suggested that innate and
instinctive behavior in animals, such as aggression, might be
instinctive in humans as well.
   ``He was a man of genius, the founding father of ethology,'' said
French behavioral scientist Remy Chauvin, who was close to Loren.
   ``For me, he was a father figure,'' said Austrian scientist Bernd
Loetsch, a student of Lorenz. ``The thrust that this tiny land made
in science and environmental thinking owes much to him.''
   Born Nov. 7, 1903 in Vienna, the son of a well-known surgeon,
Lorenz gained his first doctorate in medicine in his native city at
the age of 25.
   Five years later, after studies in Vienna and New York, he held a
doctorate in zoology and psychology on the basis of a thesis on the
flight of birds.
   Between 1923 and 1939, Lorenz devoted months to learning the
``language'' of the many birds he kept in his home.
   Chauvin said Lorenz was prompted to work with animals in nature
after his studies in the United States, where he noticed that the
behavior of caged white rats he studied there differed from that of
wild rats he had observed in Austria.
   ``He slept with geese, lying down beside them, to put their
behavior in perspective, but also for observations on man and the
child, without prejudices,'' Chauvin said.
   In 1939, Lorenz was given a professorship in the German town of
Koenigsberg, today the Soviet port of Kaliningrad.
   While there, he wrote papers considered to reflect Nazi views of
science, making him the target of criticism years afterwards.
   In 1973, accepting the Nobel prize, Lorenz apologized ``most
deeply.''
   ``Many highly decent scientists hoped, as I did, for a short time
for good from National Socialism, and many quickly turned away from
it with the same horror as I,'' he said then.
   In 1941, Lorenz was drafted. Captured by the Russians in 1944, he
spent four years as a prisoner of war, a time he later described as
``midway between being a teacher, a joker, a clown and a
soul-soother.''
   Returning home in 1948 with a manuscript written on sacks of
cement and published years later as ``The Back Side of The Mirror,''
Lorenz founded a center for behavioral research in Altenberg.
   In the 1950s, he worked mostly in West Germany, where he headed
the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Bavaria from
1961 to 1973.
   Beginning in the 1960s, Lorenz authored a series of best-selling
books including ``On Aggression,'' which was put out in German in
1963 and in English in 1966, ``The Eight Deadly Sins of the
Civilized World,'' ``Comparative Behavioral Studies,'' ``The Decay
of the Humane,'' and ``The Evolution of Thought.''

<HEAD>Most Senators Spurn Inviting Offer from Inouye</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of Sen. Daniel Inouye's colleagues on a
Senate panel have spurned his invitation to join him on a six-nation
tour, despite his promise that the taxpayer-paid trip will mix
pleasure with business.
   Inouye, D-Hawaii, the new chairman of the Senate Appropriations
defense subcommittee, has invited 17 panel members to accompany him
to the Middle East and Europe for an ``on-the-scene evaluation of
the changes which are occurring in several areas of significance to
our nation's defense requirements.''
   But Inouye's letter of invitation also notes other attractions in
Germany, Italy, Egypt, Spain, Israel and Turkey.
   ``I also intend to make a special effort to allow time for visits
to museums, art galleries, and religious and historical sites in the
capitals and the countryside of these countries,'' Inouye wrote.
   Citing protocol demands, he suggested that the senators bring
along their spouses on ``what I know will be a most enjoyable and
productive trip.''
   ``Far from being a `congressional junket,' this trip will take us
to areas which I believe we need to visit to understand the
dimensions of the problems confronting U.S. national security and to
meet the responsibilities we face as members of the subcommittee on
defense,'' he said.
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter, which
proposes the trip for the Senate's Easter vacation the last two
weeks of March.
   Only Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., has definitely signed up,
although three senators, Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; Bennett Johnston,
D-La.; and Jake Garn, R-Utah, are undecided, according to an
informal head count. The rest say they have no plans to go.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said Tuesday that he has declined
because ``I took those trips when I was chairman'' of the
subcommittee.
   The itinerary calls for three nights in Munich, three in Rome,
two in Istanbul, three in Cairo, three in Jerusalem and one in
Madrid.
   The route was designed to allow members to see ``fracture zones''
of the geopolitical world, said Inouye, whose subcommittee oversees
spending for the Defense Department and the CIA.
   Along the way, the senators would share Easter services with
American forces aboard a ship in the Persian Gulf and review
fundamental changes under way in the Middle East peace process.
   The congressional party will fly on an Air Force jet ``to ensure
that we accomplish the objectives of our trip and to add a measure
of security,'' Inouye said.
   The government picks up all expenses for members of Congress.
They receive daily per diem at the same rate as U.S. diplomats
abroad. For example, the daily rate is $163 in Munich and $98 in
Cairo.
   Congressional spouses travel free with their mates on military
aircraft, but they must pay their own expenses. A State Department
official familiar with the trip, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said arrangements such as the exact dates are not yet firm.
   In the Senate, foreign trips on behalf of a committee must be
approved by the full committee chairman, while those on behalf of
the full Senate must have the approval of the chamber's majority and
minority leaders.
   Inouye has yet to request formal approval of the trip from Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the appropriations committee,
according to Marsha Berry, the committee spokeswoman.
   Byrd, also a member of the defense panel, will not accompany
Inouye. Byrd, said spokeswoman Tina Evans, ``plans to travel to West
Virginia; that's the only traveling he'll do in March.''
   Lautenberg wants to accompany Inouye because ``he's new on the
committee and he wants to see all the installations,'' said his
spokesman, Steven Schlein.
   At least 13 subcommittee members said they have no plans to go,
most of them citing prior commitments and more pressing business at
home.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., isn't going in part because he
doesn't like being in a ``large delegation. ... He tends to prefer
trips that are more focused,'' said his spokesman, Paul Jacobson.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., declined because he recently returned
from the Middle East, an aide said.
   Senators have other plans for the recess, according to the
members or their aides: Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.; Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa; James McClure, R-Idaho; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Thad Cochran, R-Miss.

   Gena Spero might be legally insane. But if she
takes the medication that calms her, she could be in prison for the
rest of her life.
   The drug dilemma has kept the 25-year-old Spero shuttling between
jail, mental institutions and courtrooms since Jan. 10, 1983, the
day she allegedly strangled 21-year-old Gina Sindoni, whose nude
body was found in a bathtub.
   After Spero was charged in the slaying, she was diagnosed as a
paranoid schizophrenic and placed on antipsychotic medication. She
was found competent to stand trial if she relied on such drugs.
   Spero, now a psychiatric patient at Medfield State Hospital, is
taking her lawyer's advice to refuse the drugs he calls a ``chemical
straitjacket'' that would give her the equilibrium to face her
accusers in court.
   Attorney Stephen Colella said that only without the drugs would a
jury see her insanity unmasked, accurately reflecting his client's
condition the day Sindoni was killed.
   Several forensic psychiatrists questioned the ethics of Colella's
advice, including Dr. Bernard Katz, who teaches at Boston University
and Harvard.
   He called the medication Spero would take ``mind-restoring, not
mind-altering'' and said he wondered about the welfare of such
patients.
   ``I feel it's a bad investment on the part of any attorney who
recommends this to a patient. ... Mental illness can be a very
painful and troubling and extremely uncomfortable condition for many
people,'' he said.
   In a recent interview, Colella said: ``They argue that if she's
not yelling and screaming, therefore she's cured. ... If the
criminal charges were to go away, she would still be a person who
should be committed because she's a danger to herself and society.''
   Colella backs his legal tactic with a 1981 decision by the state
Supreme Judicial Court that a psychiatric patient could refuse
medication.
   District Attorney Kevin Burke disagrees with Colella, and
persists in hoping a judge will find Spero competent to stand trial
so he can try her for murder.
   But she can't be ordered to take antipsychotic drugs, and at her
annual reviews for mental competency, a judge has continued
hospitalization.
   ``It's in the best interest of justice to have this case tried,''
Burke said. ``Either this is a case of murder, which we allege, or
we have a defendant who would be found not guilty by reason of
insanity. And the only way that will be resolved is through a
trial.''
   For three years, Spero was incarcerated at the state prison for
women at Framingham until a judge ordered her moved to Medfield
State Hospital.
   Spero was a student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst
when the killing occurred. Sindoni was attending Hampshire College.
The two women had been friends about seven months and had shared a
house with other women in Northampton for a time.
   Spero had a history of mental troubles and checked into
psychiatric hospitals on several occasions, Colella said.
   Spero's arms are scarred with self-inflicted razor cuts and
cigarette burns, Collela said. She hears voices and hallucinates.
Since her hospitalization at Medfield, doctors there said she also
suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy, Colella said.
   Temporal lobe epilepsy, for which Spero takes medication, is a
psychologically debilitating illness that can cause sufferers to
become suddenly angry or to exhibit other erratic behavior.
   Such attacks themselves would justify a defense of innocent by
reason of insanity, Colella said.
   But nobody knows the extent of Spero's problems. Over the years,
she has been diagnosed with a variety of mental illnesses. A week
before the slaying she sought psychiatric treatment, but she left
before being admitted to the center.

   The Rev. Charles E. Curran will not appeal a
judge's ruling that the Catholic University of America may bar him
from teaching Catholic theology because of his dissenting views on
sexual ethics.
   ``I have lost, but the university, its faculty and students may
have lost more than I,'' Curran said after Superior Court Judge
Frederick H. Weisberg ruled in Catholic's favor on all issues raised
by Curran in his landmark breach of contract lawsuit.
   The District of Columbia judge said the school has the right to
make its own decisions in its struggle to balance its commitment to
academic freedom with obedience to the Vatican.
   Curran was strongly criticized by Vatican officials for his
positions on abortion, homosexuality and other matters of sexual
ethics during more than two decades teaching at Catholic.
   ``The court's opinion confirms what the university itself has
asserted in this case _ that full academic freedom, as understood in
American higher education, does not now exist at Catholic
University,'' Curran said.
   ``I have fought for academic freedom at Catholic University for
more than 20 years,'' he said. ``I have lost. As far as I am
concerned, this was the last battle.''
   Curran maintained the university violated his contract when last
April it stripped him of his canonical mission, which the Vatican
requires to teach Catholic theology.
   That action came two years after the Vatican declared Curran was
no longer suitable or eligible to teach Catholic theology.
   Curran contended that the canonical mission requirement had
fallen into disuse when he began teaching at Catholic in 1965. He
said a 1981 church rule making them mandatory didn't apply to him
because it wasn't in effect when he joined the faculty.
   The judge ruled that Curran should have understood that his
contract changed at that time, requiring him to maintain a canonical
mission.
   Weisberg also said the CUA faculty handbook, which by District of
Columbia law constitutes a contract, does not specify that
professors have full academic freedom.
   Curran said he feared the ruling would place limits on academic
freedom in other Catholic universities in America.
   But university officials said they felt vindicated.
   ``It doesn't surprise me, to tell you the truth,'' said the Rev.
William Byron, president of the university. ``This is really what I
expected, because we never breached his contract.
   ``I regret that this ever came to litigation, but it's nice not
to lose.''
   Curran, who remains a tenured professor at Catholic but cannot
teach there, has taught as a visiting professor at Cornell
University and is currently at the University of Southern California
at Los Angeles.
   Byron said the offer remains open for Curran to teach at Catholic
if he will accept an alternative assignment.
   But Curran said that will never happen. ``It's a matter of
principle,'' he said. ``I could not do that.''

<HEAD>Farm Prices Dip Since January, But Still Higher than Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department's preliminary
figures for February show that prices farmers get for raw products
declined 0.7 percent from their January average but still were 14
percent above a year ago.
   Lower prices for soybeans, lettuce, milk and corn were mostly
responsible for the decline from January, the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said Tuesday. Higher prices for
tomatoes, strawberries, potatoes and hay partly offset the decline
in the other commodities.
   ``Prices of food grains increased from January to February while
feed grains and oilseed prices decreased,'' the report said. ``The
all-wheat price moved to the highest level since April of 1981, but
the average corn and soybean prices dropped from January to
February.''
   Tomato prices moved up sharply during the month, and the February
average for cattle and calves was the highest since May 1979.
   The report also included revisions showing that prices received
by farmers actually rose 2.8 percent from December to January
instead of the 1.4 percent gain reported a month ago.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told Congress, meanwhile,
that the farm economy as a whole ``is continuing to make real
progress in recovering'' from the hard times of the early and
mid-1980s.
   Last year's drought helped reduce supplies of major crops,
including corn, soybeans and wheat, which has resulted in higher
prices.
   ``The higher prices have helped maintain a high cash income level
for those farmers with supplies to sell and for the sector as a
whole,'' Yeutter told the House Budget Committee.
   ``However,'' he added, ``the drought dealt a severe blow to many
producers in drought areas who lost much of their crop and who did
not have prior-year crops to sell. It also placed a heavy burden on
livestock, poultry and dairy producers who were faced with higher
feed costs.''
   According to the preliminary February price figures, based mostly
on midmonth averages, the index for livestock and livestock products
as a group declined 0.6 percent from their January average but still
were up 5.4 percent from February 1988.
   The department's all-crops price index for February was down 1.4
percent from January but averaged 27 percent above a year ago.
   No new price figures for farm production costs were included in
the February report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages
because of budget cutbacks.
   Although the projections are subject to change, USDA economists
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $48
billion to $52 billion this year, compared with a near-record of $57
billion in 1988. That is the difference between cash receipts and
cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise
moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier
production items.
   Food prices in 1988 rose an average of about 3.7 percent, and
USDA analysts say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is
likely in 1989.

   President Bush has announced his intention to
appoint a Californian, Jack C. Parnell, to the No. 2 post at the
Agriculture Department.
   Parnell, 53, has been director of the California state department
of food and agriculture since 1987 and has been high on the
preference list of Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to be
deputy secretary.
   Reports had circulated last week that although Yeutter favored
Parnell some officials at the White House were leaning toward former
Kentucky governor Louie Nunn. Yeutter, however, branded as ``totally
untrue'' reports of him bickering with the White House over the
appointment.
   Parnell, whose appointment is subject to Senate confirmation,
would succeed Peter C. Myers in the $89,500-a-year USDA job.
   The announcement on Tuesday said that before Parnell became
California state director of food and agriculture he was head of the
state's department of fish and game, 1984-87, and that from 1966 to
1983 he was a pedigree livestock auctioneer.
   Parnell also was owner and publisher of the California
Cattlemen's Magazine, 1966-72, and field editor for Pacific Stockman
and Stockman Weekly, 1964-66. The announcement said Parnell ``has
also managed and operated diversified agricultural operations.''

   FBI efforts to end discrimination against
blacks, Hispanics and women within the bureau will produce
measurable results within a year, Director William S. Sessions says.
   ``I have made it clear throughout the FBI _ not just to top
management _ that all forms of discrimination are repulsive and will
not be tolerated,'' Sessions told a House Judiciary panel Tuesday.
   He told the subcommittee that he would fight not only hiring
discrimination but racial harassment and a practice that Hispanic
FBI agents say has repeatedly blocked them from advancement within
the bureau.
   The Hispanics say they are often thrown into stopgap roles for
which Spanish-speaking agents are needed and as a result miss out on
in-depth investigative experience that leads to promotion.
   The FBI, responsible for enforcing the nation's civil rights
laws, has 8,723 special agents, of whom 419 are black, 453 are
Hispanic, 119 are of Asian background and 40 are American Indians.
   Sessions told the panel that represents an increase of 27 black
agents and 54 Hispanics since October 1987.
   Trainees not yet in the field are included, however, and FBI
officials were unable to say immediately how many employees have
been added overall since 1987, thus leaving unclear the percentage
increase in minorities if any, noted Rep. Craig T. James, R-Fla.
   ``We may have lost ground as far as agents in the field and may
need to catch up,'' James said.
   ``We have a catch-up program,'' Sessions said. He said, however,
that he would be able to present the lawmakers with measurable
improvement over the current situation within a year.
   Discrimination suits against the bureau, one brought by 238
Hispanic agents, have resulted in disclosures of bias.
   Bureau recruiters have been barred from using the facilities at
the University of Michigan law school because of findings in the
Hispanic agents' suit, although Sessions still plans to deliver the
commencement address at the school this year.
   Members of Congress are urging the FBI to settle the lawsuits
quickly.
   ``They have in my opinion been embarrassing,'' said Rep. James F.
Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis. He urged Sessions to get ``these problems
behind us because, in my opinion, we all have more important things
to do.''
   Sessions said he would increase the authority of the FBI's Equal
Employment Opportunity chief and give the official ``direct personal
access to me upon request.'' If managers balk at proposed changes,
he said, ``the EEO officer will be instructed to come directly to
me.''
   ``There will be no ambiguity about the role of this new office in
the FBI,'' Sessions said.
   Problems in local offices should be directed to resident EEO
counselors swiftly, Sessions said. He promised steps to make these
counselors, some of whom have come under criticism, ``more
responsive to the needs of their peers.''

<HEAD>Gulf Minesweeping Force Cut in Half</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has decided to call home
three of the six mine-sweeping ships it deployed to the Persian Gulf
during the height of fighting between Iran and Iraq, defense sources
say.
   The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said Tuesday the State
Department already had begun notifying friendly nations in the
region of the decision.
   The Pentagon now expects the three minesweepers to depart the
gulf by the middle of March, the sources added.
   ``The ships are being withdrawn because the threat has really
lessened'' since a cease-fire took effect last August, said one
ranking Pentagon official.
   ``But we're not withdrawing all of them because there is still an
occasional floater (underwater mine) out there. We're scaling back
at what we deem a prudent pace.''
   The decision to halve the number of minesweepers in the region
comes as American allies such as England and Italy are calling home
their naval forces, and when the U.S. Navy has stopped side-by-side
escorts for convoys of oil tankers.
   It also comes as the Joint Chiefs of Staff debate a proposal to
stop paying danger pay to U.S. sailors working inside the Persian
Gulf, and as Kuwait prepares to drop American registry for six of
the 11 tankers that the Navy had been protecting.
   ``We don't see any of the real issues being settled between Iran
and Iraq in peace talks, but on the other hand we don't see the
truce breaking down, either,'' said one administration official.
``So everybody continues to scale back.''
   In a related development, the four-star general who heads the
U.S. Central Command told Congress on Tuesday that the Soviet Union
was attempting to curry greater favor with _ and influence over _
Iran.
   ``There are signs that their relations are already improving,''
said Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the head of the command responsible
for U.S. forces in the Middle East.
   ``It is important that we avoid a precipitous drawdown of U.S.
military forces that would send the wrong signal as regards the
United States commitment to sustaining peace in the region,''
Schwarzkopf told the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee.
   ``The United States must not lessen interest in the region nor
permit that perception to develop.''
   The defense sources said Tuesday they expected the three
minesweepers that would be recalled would be the ones deployed from
the West Coast _ the Esteem, Conquest and Enhance. The other three
ships _ the Fearless, Inflict and Illusive _ traveled to the region
from ports on the East Coast.
   The Korean War-vintage craft were ordered to the gulf in the
summer of 1987, shortly after the reflagged Kuwaiti tanker Bridgeton
struck a mine while steaming in a U.S. convoy. The ships did not
arrive until November 1987, however, because they were towed across
the Pacific and Atlantic to hold down engine wear.
   The Navy has been criticized for its slow pace in replacing the
aging minesweepers with a more capable, modern mine-sweeping vessel.
But the six ships have found and neutralized a number of suspected
Iranian mines.
   The administration of former President Ronald Reagan agreed in
the spring of 1987 to extend American military protection to 11
Kuwaiti tankers after they re-registered under the Stars and
Stripes. Kuwait, a friend of the United States and a key ally of
Iraq, had seen its ships become a special target of Iranian forces.
   After eight years of fighting, Iran and Iraq finally agreed to a
truce last August and to date, the cease-fire has held.

<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court ruling allowing cities to be
sued for monetary damages in some cases is being called a moderate
decision that will protect local treasuries against bankrupting
negligence judgments.
   Lynn Branham, a professor at the Thomas M. Cooley Law School in
Lansing, Mich., who has studied the case, called Tuesday's ruling
``a moderate, middle-of-the-road approach.''
   She said municipalities still have some protection ``because mere
negligence will not suffice, but individuals are protected and on
occasion can reach into a city treasury's deep pockets to recover
for violations of their rights.''
   The justices ruled unanimously that local governments may be
forced to pay when their ``deliberate indifference'' lets
inadequately trained employees violate someone's rights.
   But in a case from Canton, Ohio, the court set tough standards
that are expected to head off a wave of successful lawsuits
nationwide.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said a city or
town cannot be held legally accountable when an inadequately trained
public employee violates someone's rights unless the harm is
directly linked to the city's deliberate indifference.
   White said creating any less-stringent standard of proof would
open local governments to ``unprecedented liability'' and saddle
federal courts with ``an endless exercise of second-guessing
municipal employee-training programs.''
   Past Supreme Court decisions make clear that a much-used federal
civil rights law may not be invoked to sue a local government every
time one of its employees violates someone's rights.
   The court previously had ruled that the local government is not
liable unless the injury stemmed from some unconstitutional official
policy.
   In Tuesday's ruling, the court for the first time said a local
government's valid official policy may be challenged successfully _
if the policy is subverted by inadequate training.
   The decision is a setback, but not a final defeat, for Canton
officials who sought to kill a lawsuit by a woman who says police
violated her rights by failing to get needed medical attention while
she was in their custody.
   Geraldine Harris sued Canton over an April 26, 1978, incident in
which she was stopped for speeding while driving her teen-age
daughter to school.
   The 52-year-old woman repeatedly slumped to the stationhouse
floor during a stay of 30 or 40 minutes but police officers did not
call for medical help, saying they believed Mrs. Harris was merely
excited and would calm down if left alone and permitted to see her
family.
   Mrs. Harris later was diagnosed as suffering from stress
reaction, anxiety and depression. She was hospitalized for a week,
and received subsequent outpatient treatment for the next year.
   A jury awarded Mrs. Harris $200,000 after deciding that she
unreasonably had been denied medical attention by police.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, although ordering a new
trial in Mrs. Harris' case, ruled that Canton could be liable for
monetary damages because its police officers were not trained
adequately to summon medical help in such cases.
   The justices returned Mrs. Harris' case to the 6th Circuit Court,
which can now order a new trial or dismiss the suit.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled 6-3 that railroads and airlines may punish strikers by
giving their jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on the
job or return to work before the strike ends.
   _Voted 9-0 in a case involving two Canadian citizens with bank
accounts in Washington state to make it easier for the federal
government to give tax information and financial records to a
foreign government.
   _Reinstated a convicted Florida murderer's death sentence, ruling
5-4 that he should have been barred from mounting a successful
constitutional attack in federal courts.

   The U.S. dollar firmed against the Japanese yen
Wednesday, while share prices declined in active trading.
   The dollar opened at 126.97 yen, the day's low, and moved up to
127.81 yen at one point before closing at 127.68 yen, up 0.53 yen
from Tuesday's close.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 300.17-point
loser Tuesday, shed another 21.30 points, closing at 31,964.30.
   Traders attributed the comeback to an 8.03-point gain in the Dow
Jones industrial average in New York overnight and to correction of
the previous day's loss, which they attributed to technical factors
unrelated to economic news.
   Tuesday's loss in the Nikkei, the market's main barometer, was
the biggest since Nov. 28, when it shed 380.27 points. The index had
been reaching new highs in recent trading days.
   In foreign exchange trading, the dollar opened the day at 126.97
yen, down 0.18 yen from Tuesday's 127.15-yen finish.
   Dealers said the dollar strengthened because of high demand at
the start of the new month.

<HEAD>Drought Looms Over California While Floods Threaten Ohio, Mississippi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spring flooding is threatening the Ohio and
lower Mississippi River basins and several areas along the Canadian
border, while California and the Missouri basin face the possibility
of more drought, the National Weather Service reports.
   Spring snowmelt conditions were detailed Tuesday by the weather
service in a report that agency scientist Michael Hudlow said
presented ``hydrological extremes'' in various parts of the nation.
   California faces the most crucial test in the next couple of
months with the possibility of a third consecutive dry summer for
the first time in this century.
   On a national basis the potential for drought doesn't appear as
severe as last summer, said Hudlow, ``but there are some areas that
definitely bear watching.''
   Meanwhile, portions of Kentucky and other southern states have
already experienced flooding and have saturated soil that could pose
a continuing danger in the runoff season.
   There also is potential for spring snowmelt flooding in northern
North Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and New
England, Hudlow said.
   In addition to California and the Missouri Valley, the spectre of
drought hangs over the Boston and New York metropolitan areas and
the Delaware River Valley, said Hudlow.
   He noted that some potential good news was included, with both
the 30-day and 90-day weather outlooks indicating a chance for
above-normal moisture in California.
   But that is not a guarantee, and the mountain snowpack that
provides most summer moisture to the Golden State is well below
normal. California's reservoirs are already low, following two dry
years, and in some parts of the state stream flow appears likely to
fall to less than 20 percent of normal, he said. The weather over
the next two months is critical, Hudlow said, noting that by May the
state enters a normally dry season.
   Hudlow, the weather service's director of hydrology, rejected the
suggestion that global ``greenhouse'' warming could be the cause of
this dryness.
   He attributed the conditions to the regular variability of
climate, as well as changes in the movement of the jet stream that
steers storm systems in from the Pacific Ocean. In addition, he
said, unusually cold water conditions in the Pacific are likely
having an effect in reducing California's moisture.
   The second area of potential drought is the Missouri Valley,
where last summer's dryness lowered reservoir levels and damaged
crops.
   ``A lot hangs in the balance of the next few months'' for this
area also, said Richard DiBouno of the Army Corps of Engineers.
   He said the snow cover is about 84 percent of normal over the
Missouri Valley, but it would take five years of normal moisture to
refill reservoirs depleted by the recent drought.
   In addition, he noted that the Missouri is a major supplier of
water to the lower Mississippi, so continued dry conditions could
affect regions downstream.
   Southern Florida also was cited by Hudlow as a major dry area,
and the threat of water supply shortages also covers Boston, New
York and the Delaware River basin.
   On the other side of the coin, flooding already has occurred in
the Ohio and lower Mississippi River valleys, Hudlow noted. The
ground is saturated in those areas and spring snowmelt could result
in further flooding problems.
   Major storms could lead to flooding in areas from east Texas
eastward into the southern Appalachian Mountains and north to the
Ohio valley, he said.
   In addition, a heavy snowpack poses the potential for dangerous
flooding in drainage areas around Lake Superior westward through the
upper Mississippi, Rainy, Souris and Red River basins.
   Flooding is also possible, but less likely, in the Adirondack
region of New York state, the Green Mountains of Vermont, White
Mountains in New Hampshire and in northern Maine, Hudlow said.

<HEAD>Postal Service Welcomes Legislation on Government Look-Alike Mail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service wants to zero in on
direct-mail groups that try to look like the government and sound
like the government in order to get consumers to open their
checkbooks.
   Private fund-raising appeals made to look as if they are from
government agencies are among the biggest consumer complaints
inadequately addressed by current law, Jack Swagerty, assistant
chief postal inspector for criminal investigations, told a Senate
Governmental Affairs subcommittee Tuesday.
   Swagerty told the Subcommittee on Federal Services at a hearing
that he endorsed legislation introduced by Sens. John Heinz, R-Pa.,
and David Pryor, D-Ark., requiring eye-catching ``look-alike'' mail
to carry a clear notice on the envelope disclaiming any connection
with the federal government.
   The bill would deal with ads such as those that appear to come
from the U.S. mint, from agencies offering surplus property or from
the Interior Department offering ``some inside track for obtaining
mining rights in public lands,'' Swagerty said.
   Currently, the Postal Service can do little to stop thousands of
pieces of mail it finds deceptive.
   For example, a private group's fund-raising appeal that said
``important Justice Department request enclosed'' was not deemed
illegal because the contents showed that it was not actually from
the government, said Tim Mahoney of the Postal Service.
   Under the proposed legislation, the envelope _ as well as the
contents _ would require a notice that it is a private solicitation.
   Under penalty of fines, the bill would require a similar
disclaimer for envelopes with official-looking seals or colors and
for organizations with important-sounding names such as the
``Federal Record Service.''
   The record service sent letters ``worded to intimidate
unsuspecting parents into believing they must obtain a Social
Security number for their newborn child,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., told the panel. He said the group charged $10, even though
anyone can get a number from the government at no charge.
   An entity called the Social Security Protection Bureau sponsored
a $50,000 sweepstakes, prompting a confused constituent to ask Heinz
when the government got into the ``gambling business.''

   Two witnesses in the hijacking trial of Fawaz
Younis said they and their families were uprooted from the Middle
East and given new identities to protect against possible terrorist
reprisal for their testimony.
   The Lebanese passenger and Jordanian flight attendant are among
four witnesses who have so far identified Younis as the leader of
five heavily armed men who stormed aboard a Royal Jordanian Airliner
on June 11, 1985, and held about 70 passengers and crew members
hostage for 30 hours.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. instructed courtroom
artists not to sketch the two witnesses as they testified Tuesday.
   Two American passengers also have identified hijackers, who took
control of the airplane in an effort to publicize their efforts to
force Palestinian refugees to leave Lebanon.
   Younis, 30, has pleaded innocent to a six-count sky piracy
indictment. The trial in U.S. District Court is a test of a 1984 law
in which the United States asserts ``long-arm'' jurisdiction over
cases involving Americans taken hostage overseas.
   The protection given the witnesses and their families shows the
lengths to which the government has gone to bring Younis to trial,
beginning with his dramatic capture on a boat near Cyprus two years
after the hijacking.
   One of the protected witnesses, Mouin Ajam, 24, said he
originally went to jail for five days rather than testify. ``I was
concerned about the danger to my parents,'' said Ajam, a Lebanese
who was one of the passengers.
   Ajam, his wife and their infant son are living under new
identities at an undisclosed location.
   Flight attendant Sawson Odetalleh, 22, testified that federal
authorities had moved her, her mother, sister, brother-in-law and
five nieces and nephews to this country under new names to guard
them against revenge.
   ``If I would come out to testify in the USA, I would be sure 100
percent that it would jeopardize my family,'' the Jordanian native
said.
   Miss Odetalleh testified that shortly after the hijackers rushed
onto the aircraft, one demanded that she identify plainclothes
Jordanian security guards on board and asked a colleague to hand him
a knife.
   ``If you don't show me the marshals, I will cut your fingers and
make your face ugly,'' she testified that the hijacker, not Younis,
told her.
   Later, the same hijacker approached her with two hand grenades,
Miss Odetalleh testified.
   ``This one will kill you, this one will burn you. Which do you
want?'' she quoted him saying.
   At another point, the same hijacker placed her between himself
and a window, explaining that he wanted a shield in case snipers
started firing, and also wrote his nickname on her leg with a pen.
   Defense counsel Francis D. Carter tried to show that Ajam and
Miss Odetalleh benefited from their agreements to testify against
Younis.
   But they argued that they had sacrificed important parts of their
lives in order to testify.
   ``We can't see my parents, they can't visit us. They can't know
where we are. That's hard for the mothers,'' Ajam testified.
   ``I left my memories. I left my language,'' said Miss Odetalleh.
``It is hard to be in the witness program ... You start from zero.''
   More than two years after the hijacking, Younis was lured on
Sept. 13, 1987, to a sailboat and arrested in international waters
13 miles off the coast of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea, testified
David W. Johnson, who led the team of a dozen FBI agents aboard the
boat.
   Younis was interrogated for four days aboard the Navy munitions
ship USS Butte and then flown to Andrews Air Force Base near
Washington, Johnson testified.
   Carter sought to convince the jury that the FBI coerced a
confession from Younis, who was seasick and suffering from two
broken wrists after his arrest.

   A Boeing 747 front cargo door that may have
popped open during a United Airlines' flight, sending nine
passengers to their deaths, had a recent history of problems,
federal investigators said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that the
Navy had tracked a falling object it believed to be the cargo door
on radar to a point 86 miles south-southwest of Honolulu, where the
ocean is 16,800 feet deep.
   The cargo door would be ``very helpful to us in our analysis,''
NTSB investigator Lee Dickinson said at a late-night briefing,
although he did not know whether an attempt would be made to
retrieve it.
   Meanwhile, a similar United jumbo jet scheduled to land Tuesday
in Honolulu from Sydney, Australia, was delayed 18 hours because of
a faulty rear cargo door, the airline said.
   While the repair took only a short time, it extended the
allowable working time for the flight crew beyond the Federal
Aviation Adminstration limit, so the flight was delayed until a
rested crew was available, a United spokesman said.
   The forward cargo door on the 18-year-old 747 that ripped open at
22,000 feet after leaving here for Auckland, New Zealand, on Friday
had electrical problems more than once in December and had to be
closed manually, said Lee Dickinson, investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   A seal on the same door was repaired in January, he said.
   At an NTSB news briefing Monday night, Dickinson would not
characterize the seriousness of the problems that were found by NTSB
investigators by checking the aircraft's maintenance records.
   United Airlines spokesman Rob Doughty said the electrical
problems are not considered serious and were on a list of deferred
items that do not affect the airworthiness of the plane.
   ``That's a list that includes things like a reading light not
working,'' he said.
   As for the faulty door seal, it is something that would be fixed
before the plane was allowed to fly, he said.
   FAA spokeswoman Bobbie Mardis in Oklahoma City, where the
maintenance records are kept, said the recent cargo door repairs
were not listed on the jet's service difficulty report, possibly
because they were minor or were completed recently and had not yet
been logged.
   FAA records show that two other airlines reported faulty Boeing
747 cargo doors in the past five years.
   One was on a Pan American 747 that departed London's Heathrow
Airport in March 1987. The airliner returned to the airport after
the crew was unable to pressurize the cabin following takeoff,
according to the records.
   A worn part on a cargo door latch was blamed for the problem.
   In the other case, the rear cargo door warning light blinked on a
Trans World Airlines 747 during departure from O'Hare International
Airport in Chicago in December 1983. Ice on a master lock pin was
the cause, investigators said.
   The United jet's cockpit voice recorder indicates that the pilot,
Capt. David M. Cronin, had no warning before the plane rapidly
decompressed, Dickinson said.
   On the recording, the cockpit crew discussed only emergency
procedures after the accident, not a possible cause or warning, he
said. Cronin managed to turn the plane around and land safely in
Honolulu on only two of the four engines.
   For Cronin, 59, the ill-fated Flight 811 was to be his
next-to-last before retirement, according to his daughter, Karen
Twigg-Smith, who lives on the island of Hawaii.
   Cronin, a 34-year veteran pilot with United, told his daughter
that he credits ``the Heavenly Father watching over him.''
   ``That's one of the first things he told me when I first talked
to him,'' she said.
   United has refused to allow Cronin and the other 17 crewmembers
of Flight 811 to talk publicly about the flight, although he is
expected to participate in a news conference in San Francisco on
Thursday.
   Of the 354 people aboard the plane, 27 were treated at hospitals,
mostly for minor injuries caused by flying debris. Two remained
hospitalized Tuesday, both United crewmembers.
   In Washington, aviation industry and government safety experts
recommended Tuesday that the Federal Aviation Administration require
$800 million worth of mandatory work on older airliners to ensure
safety of the nation's aging airliner fleet.
   The unprecedented program would affect more than 1,300 early
Boeing 747, 737 and 727 models at a cost of over $600,000 each.
   United's Flight 812 from Sydney, which was delayed because of a
rear cargo door problem, was scheduled to arrive in Honolulu at 1:10
a.m. Tuesday, according to United's reservations desk.
   United spokesman Sean McNamara in Sydney said engineers replaced
a safety pin in the cargo door as a precaution in line with a
company order to check all of the airline's aircraft.
   The federal investigation of Flight 811 has focused on the cargo
door latching mechanism, and airlines around the world took Boeing
Co.'s advice and checked the cargo doors of their 747s.
   ``What this is from us is by no means interfering or speculating
on the probable cause of the accident,'' Boeing Spokesman David
Jiminez said Monday. ``It's more of a prudent act on our part to
keep customers appraised of what we know.''
   United's headquarters in Chicago issued a statement that more
than 900 cargo doors in a fleet of 399 operational aircraft were
inspected, and seven repairs were required. Doughty said no repair
was urgent and all would have been performed in normal maintenance.

<HEAD>Bush Defends not Telling China about Invitation to Dissident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush says he's not bothered by the
row over the Chinese dissident who couldn't come to dinner and says
he won't clear such social invitations in advance with the country
hosting his visit.
   Discussing the communist government's decision to bar
astrophysicist Fang Lizhi from attending a dinner he hosted in
China's capital city last weekend, Bush said he hoped that people
wouldn't make too much over the incident.
   ``That's not the whole question when it comes to the United
States' commitment to human rights,'' the president said during a
photo session while meeting with members of his Cabinet.
   Asked whether the flap could have been averted if the U.S.
government had notified the communist government in advance of those
invited to the Texas-style barbecue at the Sheraton Great Wall hotel
_ as the Chinese have suggested _ Bush said, ``They may have a
point, that it might have been avoided.''
   But when asked if he would tell a communist host government ahead
of time about invitations to dissidents, he replied, ``No, and I
think they understand that.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended Bush's advocacy
of human rights during the two-day visit to China but acknowledged
``there is some degree of difference'' between Bush's handling of
the issue and the way former President Reagan dealt with it.
   Reagan met with dissidents during his visit to Moscow in 1988,
and the former president often gave human rights a high profile
during his public statements in foreign settings.
   Fitzwater said that Bush believes he should push human rights in
talks with communist leaders but that it should not be pursued to
the exclusion of other concerns.
   Questions have been raised about how much emphasis Bush will
devote to human rights in the wake of the flap over Fang.
   Fitzwater said that Bush chose to voice his complaint _ quietly _
to Chinese Vice Premier Wu Xuequian on Monday, the day after Chinese
police barred Fang, 52, from attending the event.
   Fitzwater said that Bush ``does feel that there are any number of
ways to call attention to our human rights policy, but to make the
views known diplomatically in a quiet way that does not disrupt or
infringe on many of the other objectives that need to be raised with
these countries.''
   ``So there is some degree of difference there,'' Fitzwater said,
``but I'll let you define'' it.
   Fitzwater said that Bush's invitation to Fang and a handful of
other dissidents was intended to make a human rights statement, and
said that the president had pushed the issue ``in any number of
ways.''
   ``I suppose maybe the proof is in the pudding, in the sense that
China today is saying the United States is to blame for the
diplomatic row,'' he said. ``Which is true. ... Which is to say that
the president invited dissidents to this banquet for a reason.''
   Four other dissidents attended the banquet, but kept a low
profile there.

   Senators are asking Edward J. Derwinski about
his exposure of a South Korean informant in a congressional bribery
case, but the nominee to run the new Veterans Affairs Department
says his nomination is proceeding well.
   After almost two hours with the Veterans Affairs Committee on
Tuesday, Derwinski said, ``I don't see anything, as a result of this
meeting, detrimental or negative.''
   The senior Republican on the committee, Frank Murkowski of
Alaska, said the nominee was ``healthy and handles himself well.''
But the chairman, Alan Cranston, D-Calif., declined comment.
   The department is being formed on March 15 by elevation of the
Veterans Administration to Cabinet status. Derwinski has been
nominated for both the jobs of administrator of the VA and the
secretary of the department.
   Derwinski was undersecretary of state for security assistance,
science and technology when President Bush chose him in January to
handle the veterans department.
   Derwinski also served 12 terms in the House as an Illinois
Republican.
   Tuesday's session went over a 1977 episode in which Derwinski
tipped off the Korean embassy that an agent of the Korean Central
Intelligence Agency was about to defect to the United States.
   Derwinski at the time was a member of a House committee
investigating the ``Koreagate'' scandal _ bribes by the Korean
government for members of Congress to ensure their support.
   The agent, Sohn Young Ho, was spirited away from his New Jersey
home by FBI agents just a half-hour before colleagues from the
Korean Central Intelligence Agency arrived.
   After his testimony, he received a new identity in the
government's protected witness program.
   In 1978, Derwinski denied being the source of the tip and
declined to testify before a grand jury. The House Ethics Committee
did not pursue the matter, saying that doing so would compromise
intelligence sources and methods.
   But in 1983, appearing before the Senate Foreign Affairs
Committee for confirmation as counselor to the State Department,
Derwinski admitted being the tipster.
   Derwinski said he did not realize there was any danger to the
agent, whom he did not identify to the embassy.
   The committee was to cover the same ground in public this
afternoon.

   Premier was a cigarette designed for people who
hate cigarettes: a butt that didn't cause cancer, that didn't cloud
the air with smoke, that didn't even dribble ashes.
   It also didn't taste very good. And that apparently is what made
the planned billion dollar project go up in smoke.
   On Tuesday, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. announced that after five
months of test marketing in Missouri and Arizona, it had snuffed out
Premier because it ``has not achieved adequate consumer acceptance.''
   During its short life, Premier neither satisfied cigarette
smokers nor placated cigarette haters. Despite its label, it was not
exactly smokeless. It gave off a steamy vapor reminiscent of
cigarette smoke.
   It was a clever bit of engineering, so high-tech that it was
probably the first cigarette to come with instructions on how to
smoke it.
   Its advantages seemed impressive. It produced almost no tar, so
it probably did not cause lung cancer. And no smoke curled off its
lighted tip, so non-smokers were less likely to become upset.
   But like many compromises, this one seemed to please nobody. To
smokers, it did not taste, feel or look enough like a real
cigarette. And to doctors who worry about smoking's effects, this
one was still a coffin nail because it almost certainly would have
caused heart disease.
   Smokers who tried it complained it was hard to light, it went
out, it did not burn down like a normal cigarette and it was hot to
hold. But worst of all was the flavor.
   ``People smoke for taste. It's very bland, and you have to draw
until you get a headache to get any taste out of it at all,'' said
Dave Grinstead, tobacco buyer for the Shop &amp; Save chain in Missouri.
   ``I thought the project initially was revolutionary in concept,''
said analyst Lawrence Adelman of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``But the
technology wasn't there yet to satisfy consumer requirements.''
   Reynolds maintained that people needed to smoke two or three
packs to develop a taste for Premier. But instead, retailers said
smokers often bought a pack, smoked one or two, passed around the
rest and never came back for more.
   Doctors noted that even though Premier lacked cancer-causing tar,
it delivered nicotine and carbon monoxide like other cigarettes.
Those things cause heart disease, which is an even bigger smoking
hazard than lung cancer.
   ``Given the fact that more people die from cardiovascular disease
associated with smoking than from cancer, it's like comparing
jumping from the 10th floor of a building with jumping from the
seventh floor,'' said Dr. Gregory Connolly, director of the
Massachusetts Office for Nonsmoking and Health.
   Dr. Dietrich Hoffmann of the American Health Foundation, a
long-time opponent of cigarettes and member of a panel that reviewed
Reynolds' scientific data on Premier, said the product represented
``some progress for those who cannot be turned off smoking.''
   While Premier clearly seemed aimed at answering some of the major
health complaints about cigarettes, Reynolds never actually made any
health claims. Instead, the brochure that came with a pack called it
``the cleaner smoke'' and said it reduced many of the
``controversial compounds'' found in ordinary cigarette smoke.
   In fact, Reynolds could not flatly state that the new cigarette
was safer. That would have been an admission that regular cigarettes
are unsafe, something the tobacco industry has never acknowledged.
   Here's how Premier worked: Instead of packed tobacco, the end of
the cigarette contained a round piece of charcoal. Behind the
charcoal was an inch-and-a-quarter long hollow aluminum capsule
surrounded by tobacco. Inside the capsule were tiny beads containing
dried tobacco, glycerin and two secret flavorings.
   When the smoker lit up and took a drag, he sucked hot air through
the metal capsule. The heat vaporized the glycerin and nicotine in
the dried tobacco as well as the flavorings. The vapor then passed
through two filters and into the smoker's mouth.
   Analysts estimated the company spent about $325 million to
develop and test market Premier, and Reynolds had said a full
nationwide launch would have raised the cost to $1 billion.
   Several analysts speculated that the timing of Premier's demise
was due to the recent buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co., which needs to cut costs at RJR to pay off the debt
it took on in the record $24.53 billion takeover.
   But others said Premier was doomed no matter what.
   ``I think the consumer reaction was so negative that it pretty
much was a foregone conclusion,'' Adelman said.

<HEAD>Tough Clean-Air Bill Promised by July 4</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate clean air supporters have promised to
write a tough, new anti-pollution bill by July 4, an announcement
made while environmental experts were telling a House panel that
healthy adults and children are now at risk from dirty air.
   The House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee was told
Tuesday that the nation faces a health emergency, with 150 million
Americans now living in areas with unsafe levels of ozone and carbon
monoxide.
   Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, representing the American Academy of
Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association, said children
are especially vulnerable to air pollution because their airways are
more narrow than those of adults, and because of their increased
frequency of respiratory infections.
   He said studies of children in summer camps show those exposed to
ozone at concentrations even below current allowable levels
developed temporary respiratory problems.
   ``Children's often high levels of activity put them at risk for
acute respiratory effects due to ozone exposure,'' Landrigan said.
   Dr. Thomas Godar, representing the American Lung Association,
said Americans mistakenly ``accept dirty air as one of the facts of
life.''
   ``Ozone can cause immediate, short-term changes in lung function
and increased respiratory symptoms in healthy adults and children
who exercise moderately or heavily during periods of elevated ozone
concentrations,'' he said.
   ``Significant decreases in lung function and symptoms such as
coughing and pain ... are experienced by exercising individuals
exposed to ozone for one to two hours at levels comparable to those
frequently found'' in unsafe air quality areas, he said.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who will sponsor the Senate's clean air
bill this year, announced that sections of the legislation will be
introduced at these time intervals: toxic air pollutants, April 3;
new air quality standards, including controls on auto emissions, May
1, and acid rain control, June 1.
   He said a complete bill should be written before Congress' July 4
recess.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, sponsor of
clean air legislation that died last year, told senators,
``Americans are suffering from a manmade phenomenon that can be
controlled. We have developed the technologies of control. We have
the resources to apply those technologies. Until now, we have lacked
the political will to do so. We must now develop that will.''
   Clean air legislation has been stalled for a decade, as
supporters of industry and environmental groups _ and different
regions of the country _ have fought to a standstill.
   Only one witness at the House hearing, representing General
Motors, said that there was no conclusive evidence that current air
quality levels caused lasting health problems.
   The chief of General Motors Research Laboratories, Dr.
Christopher C. Green, said the potential health effects from
exposure to current levels of ozone and carbon monoxide ``have been
the subject of considerable overstatement.''
   The Environmental Protection Agency said 62 areas have failed to
meet air quality standards for ozone and 59 for carbon monoxide, a
list based on readings from 1985 to 1987. The list does not yet
include 28 cities that exceeded the safe ozone levels last summer,
according to EPA data.

<HEAD>Bush Must Overcome Nunn's Influence To Win on Tower Nomination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In lobbying senators to support John Tower for
secretary of defense, President Bush has the difficult task of
overcoming the reputation Sen. Sam Nunn has built over the past 16
years as the Senate's bipartisan leader on defense issues.
   ``That's probably the toughest single obstacle the president
faces,'' Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., said Tuesday.
   Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who has been chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee since 1986 and a member of the panel since
1973, led the committee's Democrats in a 11-9 party-line vote last
week to reject the Tower nomination.
   Since then, he has made the case against Tower on national
television, in private meetings with other senators and in the
written report of the Armed Services Committee. But he insisted
Tuesday that he has not been ``strong-arming anybody'' to vote
against Tower.
   ``I'm not saying my prestige is on the line,'' said Nunn, who has
been described by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell as ``one of
_ if not the most _ respected'' members of the Senate.
   ``I give them my views and I don't make any bones about where I
stand,'' Nunn said. ``But I'm not asking them to vote on anything
other than their conscience.''
   Nunn's views are that the FBI report on Tower provides evidence
of a ``clear pattern of alcohol abuse'' and that the former Texas
senator's recent work as a high-paid consultant to defense
contractors raises serious conflict-of-interest questions.
   Those views carry substantial weight, primarily because of Nunn's
reputation among both Democrats and Republicans as a senator who
does his homework and who speaks with authority on defense issues.
   ``I have never known him to do anything in Congress that would
appear to have self-serving, narrow political implications when
dealing with national defense or foreign policy,'' former Alabama
Sen. Jeremiah Denton said Tuesday.
   Denton, a conservative Republican who served on the Armed
Services Committee with both Nunn and Tower, said he supports Tower
for secretary of defense but, unlike some Republicans, does not
believe Nunn's opposition is motivated by partisan politics.
   Nunn has resisted Republican efforts to paint the Tower
nomination as a partisan fight waged by the Democratic-controlled
Congress in an effort to weaken the new president.
   ``The Republicans, if you agree with them, they say you're a
patriot, but if you disagree, all of a sudden it's partisan,'' said
Nunn, who during the Reagan years consistently ranked as one of the
Senate's top Democratic supporters of the Republican president.
   Nunn said he realized when Tower was nominated that he would be
subjected as committee chairman to a barrage of criticism,
regardless of whether he supported or opposed the nomination.
   ``Either I would be the scapegoat because I was taking on the
president, or I would be the chairman of the Armed Services
Committee covering up the alleged transgressions of the nominee,''
he said.
   The criticism intensified Tuesday when the Wall Street Journal
reprinted a Dec. 4, 1972, article from The Atlanta Journal detailing
an Oct. 31, 1964, automobile accident in which Nunn pleaded guilty
to leaving the scene of an accident.
   In an accompanying article, the newspaper said: ``If the Senate
is entitled to pass judgment on John Tower's personal history, then
the public is also entitled to know the salient facts about those
who judge Mr. Tower.''
   Nunn acknowledged that his ``driving and judgment were impaired''
on the evening of the accident because he had too much to drink. But
he said an accident 24 years ago is not relevant to the Tower
nomination.
   ``The implication is that if I have an automobile accident in
1964, then I'm not qualified under the Constitution to render advice
and consent in 1989,'' Nunn said. ``I don't think that logic holds.''

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Commodity Programs Likely Budget Target</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says he
is still looking for areas to reduce his budget by $1.1 billion, but
believes most of the money will come from commodity programs.
   President Bush has called for the reduction, but not specified
which programs should be cut, leaving Congress with only Reagan
administration proposals.
   Yeutter assured the House Budget Committee on Tuesday he was not
wedded to the Reagan proposals.
   For example, he said ground water and food programs cut in the
proposed Reagan budget will be restored.
   He said Farmers Home Administration programs and those of the
Rural Electrification Administration, however, will be reduced along
with commodities.
   After the hearing, Yeutter told reporters that cuts in
commodities wouldn't be arbitrary.
   ``We have to go through a sophisticated analysis to determine the
extent of the changes. It may vary from commodity to commodity,'' he
said.
   ``We have to decide the best way to achieve the reduction while
still keeping a safety net for farmers. It's not an easy trick,'' he
said.
   He mentioned cutting target prices, but said they may not be cut
by the same percentage for every commodity. He also suggested that
there may be a reduction in permitted acreage.
   Yeutter told committee members who asked specifically about the
school lunch program that it was unlikely to see any reduction,
though President Reagan had suggested it be cut by $950 million.
   The secretary said he wanted to evaluate it and all nutrition
programs run by the department, but he doubted that there would be
any cuts in them.
   Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., gave Yeutter a list of programs for
low-income Americans which he said the committee over the years has
agreed must never be cut, including school lunch and other child
nutrition programs.
   An area Yeutter said should get more money is the Export
Enhancement Program.
   ``Export expansion and long-term market development are of key
importance to U.S. agriculture,'' he told the committee.
   Discussing the ongoing negotiations under the General Agreement
on Trade and Tariffs, known as GATT, Yeutter said the United States
is still committed to removing trade barriers worldwide.
   But he said the difficulty in achieving that end was demonstrated
at the midterm review of the Uruguay Round last December in Montreal
when the United States was unable to get other countries to go along
with its desire to do away with government subsidies.
   Following a meeting with Yeutter on Monday, Australian trade
chief John Duffy said the United States had softened its position,
and ``put the ball very much in the European Community's court.''
   Yeutter said after the hearing Tuesday that Duffy was correct in
saying that the ball was in the hands of the EC, but said the United
States had not softened.
   ``We formulated our proposal in a more palatable way,'' Yeutter
said.
   Trade talks resume in Geneva in April.

   President Bush has scrapped a planned trip to
his family retreat in Maine this month because of an impending birth
in the First Family.
   ``You just don't travel those last few days,'' insisted First
Lady Barbara Bush, who said she told the president to forget about
plans for a pre-Easter visit to Kennebunkport, Maine.
   And that was that.
   The family dog, Mildred K., or ``Millie,'' an English springer
spaniel, is expecting _ and due sometime between March 15 and 20.
   While awaiting the new canine arrival, Mrs. Bush says she plans
to ride around the White House grounds on one of the two new
``Flying Pigeon'' bicycles that she and the president were presented
during their visit last week to Beijing.
   It's the same kind of bike that she and Bush used to ride in the
mid-1970s when they lived in the Chinese capital, where cars are few
and most people get around on bikes.
   The president was head of the U.S. mission there from 1974-75.
   The oval on the South Lawn of the White House is exactly one
quarter mile, Mrs. Bush said. She said it was a good place to use
the new bicycle.
   When they were presented with the gift bikes, Chinese Premier Li
Peng suggested that that the Bushes ride the bikes around the White
House grounds.
   The president, who gave Li a pair of black Texas boots in return,
said he and Mrs. Bush would probably ride the bicycles in
Kennebunkport.
   Li indicated that the boots, boasting flags of the United State
and China, probably would not get as much of a workout. He said it
wasn't a custom in China to go around with boots bearing flags, but
he might wear them if he ever visited the United States.

   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater selected an unusual
way to announce his engagement.
   ``The Chinese security dislocated my fiance's jaw,'' Fitzwater
complained, thereby confirming what many associates knew but which
Fitzwater had never before announced.
   Chinese security guards, during Bush's visit last week to
Beijing, engaged in what appeared to be a favorite pastime: pushing,
shoving and pummeling U.S. news media.
   At one point, Carol Powers, a photographer who works for the
White House, was slammed into a door.
   Mrs. Bush shouted at the security folks to ``calm down.''
   ``This girl's job is to take my picture,'' she said. ``She works
for my husband.''
   Said a blushing Fitzwater of Ms. Powers, his fiancee: ``We
haven't really made an official announcement. But we are engaged.''
   He said the decision had been made ``the weekend before we left''
for the China trip. No date has been set.

   When the president went on Chinese television earlier this week,
he became the first foreign leader ever to do so.
   Chinese officials said the live, unedited interview reached
between 400 to 600 million Chinese, an audience even Johnny Carson
would envy.
   But Bush had a hard time making it to the TV studio on time. His
meeting with Chinese Communist party leader Zhao Ziyanf dragged on
and on.
   The session went 25 minutes beyond its scheduled close. Bush's
motorcade, racing at speeds up to 60 mph, sped to the TV studio and
arrived with less than five minutes to spare before air time. Bush
sprinted up the outside stairs to the studio.
   He was rushed in, some makeup quickly applied to his face. The
time of the interview was selected by U.S. officials: it followed an
Italian soccer match and came before Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck
cartoons.
   ``We all agreed it was the best possible time,'' said Andrew C.
Koss, an official at the U.S. embassy in Beijing.
   ``The majority of viewers were tuned in to watch Mickey and
Donald,'' he said.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan defends
his decision to fight inflation with higher interest rates even
though the Bush administration disagrees with the central bank's
reading of the economy.
   Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee on Tuesday that the
current inflation rate is not ``doing clear, significant, corrosive
harm to the economy at the moment.''
   ``But it has built into it the seeds of an acceleration that if
not dampened ... can become very damaging,'' he said in his first
public statement since the Federal Reserve escalated its
anti-inflation fight Friday by increasing a key bank lending rate.
   He said the central bank expects inflation to increase this year
to the 4.5 percent to 5 percent range, up about half a percentage
point from last year.
   However, Fed policy makers are worried that a pickup in wage
increases and rising material costs will cause businesses and
consumers to include the expectation of inflation in their plans.
When that happens, prices will rise faster, he said.
   ``Our basic goal is to make sure that inflation does not
accelerate inordinately and ultimately phases down,'' he said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in testimony before the
House Budget Committee, softened previous criticism of Federal
Reserve tightening, but he did not retract his statement that the
administration sees less danger of inflation.
   ``It's two people looking at the same statistic and coming to a
slightly different conclusion,'' Brady said.
   Greenspan, while not explicitly acknowledging the
administration's comments, said in response to a question from Sen.
William L. Armstrong, R-Colo., ``I think I get it from all sides.''
   In the budget committee, Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., and
Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., praised the Fed for its stance toward
inflation, but Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., told Greenspan, ``I'm
afraid you're laying the seeds for a recession.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said he believed the Fed's strategy
of gradual increases in interest rates would not work and that ``far
more ratcheting down'' of the economy will be needed to achieve the
Fed's stated goal of zero inflation.
   ``You've got to almost create a self-fulfilling prophecy and
create a recession,'' he said.
   Brady, Greenspan and White House budget director Richard Darman,
who spoke to the Senate Appropriations Committee, all said that
Congress and the administration can help the Fed curb inflation and
also permit interest rates to drop by agreeing on a credible plan to
cut the budget deficit.
   Greenspan said President Bush's budget, if adopted, would trigger
lower interest rates even if it eventually produced a deficit higher
than the $100 billion Gramm-Rudman target for 1990.
   ``I may say I would like to see Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets met
literally (but) I don't think that is required to bring a
significant reduction in interest rates,'' he said.
   ``If, after the fact, the real number is $110 billion or $120
billion, in that vein, I would think that would be a major
improvement which the markets would take very positively,'' the
Federal Reserve chairman said.
   But, the reduction from the 1989 deficit of about $165 billion
must not be accomplished with accounting tricks and must hold out
the reasonable prospect for further reductions, he said.
   ``What cannot have a positive effect is finding some set of
bookkeeping gimmicks which largely meet Gramm-Rudman for fiscal 1990
and then paper over `91, `92, `93,'' he said.

<HEAD>Agency Says Food Supply Safe from Cancer-Causing Fungus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government confirms the drought helped
increase the cancer-causing fungus aflatoxin in the 1988 corn crop
in the Midwest, requiring some corn to be diverted to feed non-dairy
cattle.
   But the government disputed concerns raised in a report by The
Wall Street Journal last week that aflatoxin-tainted corn is moving
through the nation's food chain because of inadequate sampling and
unreliable testing.
   In a statement Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration said the
agency ``does not believe such concern is warranted because there is
plenty of aflatoxin-free corn available for human consumption, and
several layers of protection are in place.''
   Aflatoxin is linked to the development of liver cancer in
laboratory rats. Last year's heat and drought provided ideal
conditions for development of the fungus that produces aflatoxin.
   Primary concern has centered around possible contamination of the
milk and corn supply.
   The FDA said the agency reaffirmed to state health officials last
fall its aflatoxin limit of 0.5 parts per billion for milk.
   States and the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments,
which has prime responsibility for testing milk, expanded monitoring
and as a result some milk in Texas, Minnesota, Iowa and southern
Illinois had higher levels of aflatoxin than allowed and had to be
dumped, the FDA said.
   The level of aflatoxin allowed in corn is 20 parts per billion,
and about 6 percent _ 95 samples out of 1,650 _ of the field corn
tested in recent months had higher levels, the FDA said. This corn
cannot be used for human consumption but can be diverted to feed
non-dairy cattle, the FDA said.
   In addition to FDA testing, which is concentrated in high risk
areas, tests are conducted by the U.S. Agriculture Department and
the states, manufacturers and millers who buy corn for food products.
   The FDA also tested about 100 corn products on store shelves _
including cooked cereal, dry cereal, tortillas, corn chips and
popcorn _ and all were negative, agency spokesman Bill Grigg said.
   FDA tested about 263 samples of corn flour and corn meal and
found 2 percent, or six samples, to have more than 20 parts of
aflatoxin per billion. FDA policy requires that these products be
removed from the market.

   Tests found excessive amounts of lead and
barium in the water from drinking fountains in USA Today's
newsrooms, but the cause of a high number of miscarriages among
employees remains undetermined, a spokeswoman for the newspaper says.
   Employees were notified of the levels in excess of the
Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines in a memo distributed
Monday, spokeswoman Sheila Gibbons said.
   But there was such a disparity in the levels of lead and barium
in the tests that the newspaper has asked for a new series of tests
of the drinking water, Ms. Gibbons said Tuesday.
   Ms. Gibbons said the water tests are part of an overall
environmental check which began a few months ago when the newspaper,
owned by Gannett Co. Inc., learned informally that a large number of
pregnant women on its staff had miscarried.
   ``We are looking at several things in the newsroom environment,''
she said. ``Preliminary tests have been made on building materials
and carpeting as well as the water.
   ``So far there has been nothing conclusive,'' she said.
   Concerns over the miscarriage rate at the newspaper's
headquarters here surfaced more than two months ago after an
informal survey found that 14 women who work on the 14th and 15th
floors of the building had suffered miscarriages since September
1987.

   Leroy W. Dubeck hopes that giant ants and
man-eating plants will soon invade the nation's classrooms. But the
physics professor insists he's no mad scientist bent on revenge: His
only gripe is ignorance.
   With international comparisons showing U.S. students dead last in
scientific knowledge, the Temple University professor believes
American youngsters might profit from spending some classroom time
studying science fiction film thrillers.
   ``The purpose is to tell kids that this thing called science can
be fun, and it can help me understand the world around me,'' said
Dubeck in a telephone interview.
   He has published a 185-page curriculum, ``Science in Cinema:
Teaching Science Fact Through Science Fiction Films,'' consisting of
lesson plans exploring the scientific truths and falsehoods in 10
sci-fi films that Dubeck and co-authors Suzanne E. Moshier and
Judith E. Boss say have proven excellent for teaching science.
   The curriculum, published by Columbia Teachers College Press, was
field tested in a dozen Philadelphia area schools in 1987-88. Test
results of the 398 students exposed to the sci-fi curriculum showed
that youngsters came away with a better understanding of scientific
process and felt more positive about science.
   ``The greatest impact was on attitudes,'' said Matthew Bruce,
professor of science education at Temple who conducted the testing.
   ``Children are turning off to science in droves. This curriculum
could retard that, although in and of itself it probably can't
reverse it.''
   Films in the curriculum were selected for their cinematic
quality, their availability on videocassettes, and their ability to
trigger discussions of scientific issues.
   For example, the immensely popular ``Star Wars'' isn't much good
for teaching science.
   ``Too much of it is fantasy,'' said Dubeck. ``It gets all hung up
with reincarnation, and `the force.'''
   But students can get a new twist on astronomy and physics from
``Forbidden Planet,'' the 1956 classic. Can a spaceship possibly
travel faster than the speed of light? Where does Robby the Robot
get his incredible energy?
   ``The Andromeda Strain,'' a 1970 film about a killer microbe from
outer space, could generate discussions about the problems
scientists are having in conquering AIDS.
   Students can learn about plant life from ``The Day of the
Triffids,'' a 1963 British offering featuring man-eating mutant
plants from outer space.
   And ``Them!'' a chilling 1954 film about a world of giant ants,
depicts accurately the habits of real ants and can get students
talking about whether radiation could possibly create such mammoth
mutations.
   Other films in the curriculum included ``The Day the Earth Caught
Fire,'' ``Destination Moon,'' ``When Worlds Collide,'' ``The Day the
Earth Stood Still,'' ``Five Million Years to Earth,'' and
``Colossus: The Forbin Project.''
   Dubeck, a science fiction buff who owns copies of more than 250
such films, has taught a course on ``Science, Science Fiction and
Film'' at Temple since 1977, and thought the idea might work for
high school students as well.
   With $162,000 in grants from the National Science Foundation, the
new curriculum was tried in 13 Philadelphia-area public and
parochial high schools and one middle school last year. Dubeck and
Moshier, a professor of biology at the University of Nebraska,
trained 24 high school science teachers to use the curriculum during
the summer of 1987.
   Multiple choice exams at the beginning and end of the school year
showed that 80 percent of the 398 students in classes using science
fiction films outscored 373 students in ordinary classes in science
knowledge, knowledge of scientific process, and in attitudes toward
science careers.
   Classes using the curriculum saw four to six films during the
year, mixed in with traditional science education. In no case did
the films and accompanying discussions take up more than 5 percent
of total class time, Dubeck said.
   Perhaps above all, wrote Dubeck, many science fiction films
depict science as solving problems, rather than causing them.
Students often perceive chemistry simply as the cause of pollution,
and physics connotes the risk of nuclear accidents.
   ``If science seems to many to have failed in the real world,'' he
wrote, ``it still offers hope and fulfillment of dreams in science
fiction.''

<HEAD>Drug Use Among Seniors at Lowest Level Since 1975</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug use among high school seniors is
declining, even though more than half of all students still had used
an illegal drug at least once, according to a new report.
   ``The news is very encouraging,'' said Charles R. Schuster,
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which sponsored
the study. ``But we don't want to imply that the war is won.''
   ``The problem is there are still pockets, primarily among those
who have dropped out of high school, where drug use remains at very
high levels,'' he said.
   Some 16,300 high school seniors from 135 schools nationwide were
polled in the survey.
   The survey, which has been conducted every year since 1975, found
that the share of high school seniors who reported having ever used
an illegal drug dropped from 56.6 percent in 1987 to 53.9 percent in
1988. That's the lowest level recorded since the survey began, when
the rate was 55.2 percent.
   Peak illegal drug use occurred in 1981, when 65.6 percent of
seniors reported having indulged at least once, according to the
survey.
   The proportion of seniors who reported using an illegal drug
within the previous year dropped from 41.7 percent in 1987 to 38.5
percent in 1988, and the percentage reporting use within the
previous 30 days dropped from 24.7 percent to 21.3 percent in the
same period, the survey showed.

<NOTE>Connaught Laboratories Recalls 46,000 Vials of DTP Vaccine</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connaught Laboratories of Swiftwater, Pa., has
recalled 46,000 vials of DTP vaccine as a precautionary measure
because of a labeling error, the company and the Food and Drug
Administration said.
   DTP vaccine is used routinely to immunize infants and children
against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.
   The recall was begun because four vials of equine influenza,
found in a plant warehouse, were mislabeled as DTP vaccine. Equine
influenza vaccine is used in immunizing horses against several
strains of flu.
   As a safety precaution, the company notified 1,865 customers to
return all vials with the lot number 8M91039.
   The FDA said less than 20,000 of the 46,000 vials in the lot were
actually shipped to doctors, pharmacists and distributors nationwide.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young, in a statement, said the
labeling error is not believed to constitute a health hazard because
Connaught officials believe they have located the only mislabeled
vials.
   ``Parents should not be unduly alarmed, nor should they interrupt
their children's immunization schedules, but we feel that the action
of the company to recall the marketed vaccine is prudent,'' Dr.
Young said.

<TEXT>
   Bryant Gumbel, who has snipped at David
Letterman, Connie Chung and Linda Ellerbee and others, is at it
again, this time firing a rocket at fellow ``Today'' show staffers
such as Willard Scott and Gene Shalit.
   In a 6-month-old memo made public by New York Newsday on Tuesday,
he accused weatherman Scott of holding NBC's top-rated morning talk
``hostage'' to his ``bad taste.'' He said consumer advocate David
Horowitz is a ``walking cliche.'' He said Shalit's movie reviews are
often too late and his interviews ``not very good.''
   Medical correspondent Art Ulene's theme weeks were dubbed
``boring,'' and many of New York-based consumer correspondent Betty
Furness' reports ``too local.''
   Jane Pauley escaped mention.
   Her co-host, who wrote the memo last August when he was
negotiating his three-year, $7 million contract, could not be
reached for comment Tuesday because he was on vacation.
   It's not the first time Gumbel's grumbles have made news. In a
September issue of Sports Illustrated, he recounted his
disenchantment with Chung, Ellerbee and Letterman, among others.
   Even Pauley, who keeps a scrupulously happy face, seemed
exasperated by Gumbel's long-time war of words with the host of
NBC's ``Late Night,'' which stemmed from Letterman's bullhorn
disruption of a prime-time ``Today'' special. During an interview
with Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas of ``Miami Vice,''
Letterman shouted from an upper floor of the NBC building, ``I'm
Larry Grossman, president of NBC News, and I'm not wearing pants!''
   NBC's producer later confirmed that the bit had been arranged,
though not cleared with the ``Today'' stars. Pauley said even she
wasn't angry at Letterman, and she was the one doing the interview
when the disruption occurred, not Gumbel.
   That didn't keep Gumbel from launching and continuing a feud with
Letterman that escalated to the point of Gumbel questioning
Letterman's manhood, during a news conference last summer. Letterman
has since said the feud is a joke, but anyone who's seen Gumbel
discuss the matter would be hard to convince.
   Scott was the target of Gumbel's toughest jabs.
   ``This guy is killing us and no one's even trying to rein him
in,'' Gumbel complained, and suggested ``nuking'' the assistant who
supplies Scott with viewers' birthdates for Scott's birthday
greetings to centenarians.
   Scott called Gumbel's comments ``old stuff.''
   ``It's all water over the dam,'' Scott said. ``I don't think he's
a happy man. We're all here to have fun and make money.''
   Shalit said: ``I love what I do and I'm proud of my work. People
always have something to say in any creative organization. It
doesn't bother me. Besides, I think Bryant is a terrific guy.''
   Furness said she reports only on stories that are of national
interest. Ulene said Gumbel is a smart guy about television, though
he apparently doesn't understand the importance to viewers of, say,
Cholesterol Week. Horowitz said he stands on his record.
   Gumbel also griped to executive producer Marty Ryan about Ryan's
alleged ``lack of guidance and a lack of willingness to stand on
folks and make sure they do what's necessary.''
   Ryan, who was the recipient of the memo, told Newsday it was
``stolen'' out of a computer file and that ``Bryant and I always
have candid exchanges about the show.''
   NBC News President Michael G. Gartner declined to comment, but
was supportive of Ryan in his regular, weekly interoffice newsletter
to the staff.
   Gartner has his share of negative press coming. An article in
March's Manhattan,inc. magazine, due on newsstands Thursday, says
many at NBC News fear Gartner, who signed on last summer, is a
short-term ``hatchet man'' brought in by budget-conscious parent
corporation G.E.
   Gartner's most visible-to-viewers action so far was to
consolidate NBC's ballyhooed new ``Sunday Today'' with ``Meet the
Press,'' a move credited with prompting former NBC White House
correspondent Chris Wallace, one of NBC's few big-name news stars,
to jump to ABC.

<TEXT>
   At the request of its Moslem minority, the
government of this predominately Christian country has banned the
sale and possession in Kenya of Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   James Njiru, minister for national guidance and political
affairs, said Tuesday that the banning was based on ``a short
review'' of the book, which many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   The review, Njiru said, ``clearly indicates that the content of
the book is offensive to Moslems who constitute an important section
of the Kenyan community.''
   About 6 percent of this African country's 20 million people
belong to the Islamic community, which had asked the government to
institute the ban.
   Other countries that have banned the book include India,
Pakistan, Egypt and South Africa.
   Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has called on Moslems to seek
out and kill Rushdie, who is in hiding, and his government has
threatened to break diplomatic relations with Britain unless it
denounces the author.
   Britain is among more than a dozen European countries that have
recalled their ambassadors from Iran over the death threat.

   Andy Timar, longtime representative of
The Associated Press in Hungary and a senior correspondent of the
national news agency MTI, has died after a brief illness. He was 65.
   Timar died Tuesday at a Budapest hospital he had entered Sunday
for tests after becoming ill. He died in his sleep after developing
respiratory problems.
   From 1946 to 1947, Timar worked with the English-language section
of the Hungarian delegation to the Allied Control Commission, which
governed Hungarian affairs immediately after World War II.
   He then joined the press department of the British Embassy in
Budapest.
   Timar first worked for the AP as a stringer in 1957 and was hired
as its representative in Hungary in 1962.
   He had worked for MTI since 1962, first in the agency department
that sent news abroad, then as an editor on the English-language
Daily News newspaper.
   Timar was a serious student of languages, art and history and
traveled widely throughout the world in his years with MTI and the
AP. He also had been active for years in the Budapest foreign press
club.
   He is survived by his wife, Piroska.

<HEAD>National Network Discourages Using Deformed Babies As Donors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Severely deformed babies facing certain death
should not be routinely considered as organ donors, even though
hundreds of children desperately need new hearts and livers, the
national transplant network said.
   Directors of the United Network for Organ Sharing adopted a
policy Tuesday discouraging, at least for now, use of anencephalic
infants as organ donors. The board noted, however, ``it is unwise to
recommend a moratorium.''
   The issue of whether to take organs from anencephalic infants _
babies born without most of their brains _ has troubled experts for
some time, but some say it is the only way to save other dying
babies and children for whom there are few organs.
   ``We're certainly not going to take organs from a live person,
but in our hearts and in our minds we know these people are not
alive,'' said Brian Broznick, director of the Pittsburgh Transplant
Foundation and a proponent of anencephalic donors.
   Broznick and many other procurement officials are distressed that
they must refuse organs from anencephalic infants until all brain
activity ceases. By then, the organs often are not fit for
transplantation due to infection.
   Anencephalic infants are born with only part of a brain stem,
which controls respiration. Because they do have slight brain stem
activity, they are not legally brain dead, a necessary state before
organs can be removed from a human body.
   Half the 1,000 to 2,000 anencephalic babies delivered each year
in the United States are stillborn. The other half generally die
within one week.
   ``Not all parents would do it (donate),'' said Art Caplan,
director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of
Minnesota. ``But I'm sure there would be a significant number of
donors.''
   Broznick, in fact, believes there probably would be enough organs
to accommodate the 400 to 500 children awaiting liver transplants in
this country.
   ``We could probably take care of all those kids, and we can't do
anything about it,'' he said. ``By the same token, we could offer
this couple (with an anencephalic baby) an opportunity for something
positive to come out of this life that they've tried to bring in.
It's a real sad situation.''
   Only one anencephalic child has ever had its organs removed for
transplantation in the United States. That case occurred on Oct. 16,
1987, at Loma Linda University Medical Center in California.
   The heart recipient, a boy who was born the day of the operation,
is doing well at home in British Columbia, said Loma Linda
spokeswoman Anita Rockwell.
   The hospital has had a moratorium since August on cases involving
infants suffering from the incurable birth defect. However,
anencephalic infants reportedly have been used as organ donors in
Canada, Europe and Japan.
   Because of the growing interest in the infants as donors, the
United Network for Organ Sharing's ethics committee began studying
the matter last year. The panel recently presented its
recommendation to the network's 32-member board of directors, which
adopted the position during a regular meeting Tuesday in New Orleans.
   The board said further study is needed and could prompt a
re-evaluation of its position.
   ``We must have agreement on how you diagnose death and
brain-death in anencephalic infants before we can go any further,''
said Caplan, an ethics committee member.
   The Virginia-based United Network administers the National Organ
Procurement and Transplantation Network.

<HEAD>Elizabeth Taylor's Doctors Targeted in Prescription Drug Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are investigating allegations that
some physicians prescribed excessive quantities of drugs for actress
Elizabeth Taylor, the District Attorney's Office said.
   The Oscar Award-winning actress is not herself the target of a
criminal investigation, spokesman Al Albergate said Tuesday.
   Miss Taylor admitted in a 1987 magazine interview that she had
undergone treatment for addiction to painkillers and alcohol. A call
to Miss Taylor's publicist wasn't answered after hours Tuesday.
   Albergate said the investigation involves allegations that at
least two doctors during the past year prescribed excessive amounts
of various opiates, barbiturates and stimulants to her ``without
medical justification.''
   He did not identify the drugs or the doctors, nor did he say when
the probe began or what prompted it. Miss Taylor has not met with
authorities, he said.
   The doctors could be charged with illegally prescribing drugs, a
violation of the state's Health and Safety Code, he said.
   The state Attorney General's Office also is investigating and
submit its reports to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's
Office, Albergate said.
   ``We are not commenting on it in any way,'' said Alan Ashby, a
spokesman for the Attorney General's Office. He did say that a
recent law requiring doctors to submit drug forms to the state
justice department makes it possible to monitor prescription drug
usage more carefully.
   Miss Taylor, who turned 57 Monday, was honored last Thursday in
Palm Springs for her philanthropic work. She addressed speculation
about her health, saying she fractured her back last summer and it
took a long time to heal.
   ``But I'm fine now,'' she said.
   Her appearance followed a month-long seclusion that spawned
rumors that she had gained weight and underwent treatment for drug
or alcohol abuse.
   Her publicist, Chen Sam, said recently that Miss Taylor was
suffering back pain and had been admitted to St. John's Medical
Center in Santa Monica for X-rays.
   Miss Taylor hurt herself in June when she fell on the set of the
film ``Young Toscanini'' in Rome. She has suffered recurring back
problems since childhood when she fell off a horse during the
filming of ``National Velvet.''
   In a 1987 interview, Miss Taylor said she would have died had she
not sought treatment for her use of Demerol and alcohol.
   She won best actress Oscars in 1960 for ``Butterfield 8'' and in
1966 for ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''

<TEXT>
   Riot police overpowered and arrested 28
leading dissidents who tried to reach the North Korean border today
for talks with communist officials on reuniting the divided Korean
peninsula.
   Police seized the dissidents after a six-hour standoff on the
main highway from Seoul to the Panmunjom border truce site. They
forced their way onto the dissidents' bus and took them to a nearby
police station.
   ``Get away, get away,'' some of the dissidents shouted as they
were taken off the bus at the station. Dissident leader Lee Jae-oh
and some other protesters kicked and punched police trying to take
them away.
   The radical United National Democratic Movement of Korea had sent
delegates to try and reach the border truce site for talks with
North Korean officials on reuniting the peninsula that has been
divided since 1945.
   North Korean radio, in a report monitored in Tokyo, said its
delegates waited at Panmunjom for two hours for the dissidents. It
accused the South Korean and U.S. governments of blocking
reunification.
   ``Indiscriminate violence by the South Korean rulers ... at the
U.S. imperialists' instigation, is unbearable, undemocratic and an
act counter to unification,'' the radio said.
   South and North Korean officials are to meet Thursday at
Panmunjom to try and work out terms for a meeting between their
prime ministers _ which would be the highest level contact ever
between the two Koreas.
   Dissident leaders reject the Seoul government's efforts to ease
tension with the north and earlier announced plans to conduct their
own talks. North Korea backed the dissidents in an apparent move to
embarass Seoul.
   Lines of riot police with shields blocked the main highway from
Seoul today when the dissidents' bus reached the Naeyu checkpoint 12
miles from the border.
   Troopers with shields immediately surrounded the bus to stop
dissidents from getting off and the protesters stayed aboard for
about six hours, partly blocking the highway.
   Angry dissident leaders, leaning from the bus windows, repeatedly
denounced the United States, charging that Washington keeps troops
in the south to prop up the Seoul government and perpetuate division
of the peninsula.
   ``Withdraw Americans blocking unification,'' the dissidents
chanted.
   A dissident leader read a statement denouncing South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo's government and charging that it does not
want union with the north.
   Roh has been holding talks with North Korea on improving
relations as part of a major initiative to reduce tensions on the
peninsula.
   ``The government and the U.S.A., if they really want peaceful
unification of the nation, should not use force in blocking us,''
the dissident spokesman said.
   South Korean dissidents are demanding immediate reunification
with the communist north, claiming all the south's political
problems stem from the peninsula's division.
   In Seoul today, Roh delivered one of his strongest warnings yet
to radicals and dissidents saying South Korea can no longer tolerate
attempts to overthrow its democratic system.
   ``We have reached a stage where we can no longer tolerate
attempts to topple the government through class revolution,'' he
said in a speech marking the 70th anniversary of a nationwide
uprising against Japanese colonial rule.
   ``All of us who share responsibility in this land must take a
clear-cut attitude toward anti-democracy groups that shake our free
society from its very foundation,'' he said.
   Dissidents were blocked Tuesday near the Panmunjom border site
when they tried to meet with North Korean officials to make
arrangements for today's planned meeting. U.S. military border
guards were involved in the scuffle.
   The United States has about 42,000 troops in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty.

   A Vermont woman was arrested on an abandonment
charge for allowing two homeless men to babysit for her 4-year-old
son at a bus terminal while she smoked crack on a street, police
said.
   Deborah Longueil, 23, of Brattleboro, also was charged with
endangering the welfare of a minor after she showed up at a police
station Tuesday and reported her child missing.
   Police had begun searching for the mother and they found the boy
with the homeless men in the Port Authority bus terminal Monday
evening.
   Before Longueil was booked, she ``said she was looking for the
kid all night _ in hotels, movie theaters and the Port Authority,''
said Sgt. Bernard Poggioli of the Port Authority youth services.
   ``But she wasn't looking too hard,'' Poggioli said. ``We have
people on the street who say they saw her doing crack. ... After 26
hours and you're not looking for your kid, I'd say that's
abandonment.''
   Port Authority police patrol the bus terminal, where dozens of
homeless people beg and sleep among thousands of commuters and
long-distance travelers.
   A police officer saw the two men with the child Monday evening
and became suspicious, said Juvenile Officer Manny Rivera.
   The men said the boy's mother had left him with them while she
went out to work as a prostitute, according to Rivera.
   ``They didn't even know her name, or the child's,'' said
Poggioli. ``They called her Sarah.''
   The two men, John Best, 39, and Nicholas Villardi, 31, were
arrested for trespassing. Rivera said the area in which they were
found is reserved for people with bus tickets.
   Police said they also discovered that Best was wanted on drug and
weapons possession charges here.
   The boy was handed over to the Bureau of Child Welfare.
   Armando Arrastia, a spokesman for the Port Authority police, said
the child's aunt and grandfather, who previously had custody of him,
were in New York and planned to go to Family Court today to try to
get the boy back.
   Poggioli said Longueil was wanted in Vermont on shoplifting
charges and once ``went through drug rehab.''

<HEAD>Younger Daley Struggling to Escape His Father's Long Shadow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard M. Daley, owner of the most famous last
name in Chicago politics, rarely invoked his father's memory during
his Democratic mayoral primary campaign. But with his victory
secure, he made sure to pay his dues.
   ``Today, when I was walking down to vote with my wife ... when I
looked up, I know he was looking down on me,'' Daley said Tuesday
night of six-term Mayor Richard J. Daley.
   In unofficial returns, the younger Daley garnered 57 percent of
the vote in the primary to oust Mayor Eugene Sawyer and move to the
April 4 general election
   The elder Daley was the boss of big-city machine politics, the
purveyor of patronage, the last of a political breed, dying in 1976
three months into his third decade in office.
   His son, who often sat in the mayor's seat as a youngster,
recalled that his father had told him that in politics, ``you're
going to have ups and downs. You're going to win; you're going to
lose.''
   And despite the sterling showing Tuesday, the younger Daley has
had some of both, in politics and in life.
   He had to fight to overcome the shadow of his father as he worked
his way through his father's old high school and law school.
   But those difficulties paled compared to the great personal
tragedy Daley and his wife, Maggie, endured when their 33-month-old
son, Kevin, died in 1981 after a long battle with spina bifida.
   The couple's three other children, Nora, 15, Patrick, 13, and
Elizabeth, 5, stood alongside their 46-year-old father and his wife
on the victory platform Tuesday night. In a poignant moment, he
thanked each, then added, ``and especially, Kevin, who is always in
our hearts. And to the best campaigner in the family, my wife,
Maggie.''
   Daley also went through a hurtful defeat in a 1983 three-way
primary between himself, then-incumbent Democratic Mayor Jane Byrne,
and Harold Washington, who won and went on to become the city's
first black mayor.
   ``I've been on both sides of these election nights,'' he recalled
Tuesday. ``I know what it's like to win, and I know what it's like
to pour your heart into a campaign and lose.''
   It took Daley three tries to pass the bar exam to become a
lawyer, a sore point exploited during the campaign by Jesse Jackson
and other opponents.
   Daley responded with a brusqueness many say is reminiscent of his
father.
   ``I flunked the bar exam. So what? Maybe I should have committed
suicide,'' he said.
   Besides, he added, a passing grade only would have led to charges
that ``my father had it fixed for me.''
   To be sure, Daley has been helped by his name _ getting elected
to the Illinois Senate at age 29, and as Cook County state's
attorney three times, including the first win against a party-slated
candidate.
   But there's no easy way to say how strong his father's effect has
been, said Eugene Kennedy, a Loyola University professor and author
of a biography of the elder Daley entitled ``Himself.''
   ``There's nobody like his father. ... But Rich has acquired a
confidence in himself and his judgment that resemble the father in
some ways. And he's overcome enough adversity on his own ... to
establish a separate identity, to start the long climb out from
under his father's shadow,'' Kennedy said.
   The eldest of seven children, Daley had his first political post
as an 18-year-old page for the Illinois delegation to the 1960
Democratic National Convention.
   In the state Senate, he showed more acumen than many gave him
credit for, and forged alliances with anti-machine reformers on
social-welfare legislation affecting nursing homes and abolishing
taxes on certain foods and medicine.
   Frank Kruesi, a top aide, said Daley studied hard as a legislator
and knew his material.
   ``Rich has been handicapped by the fact that people have trouble
getting past his name,'' Kruesi said.
   ``If his name were Richard J. Schwartz, he'd be lionized for the
work he's done as a legislator and as state's attorney.''

   For the fifth year running, a Texan has
walked down the runway as the winner of the Miss USA contest.
   ``They called my name and I was shocked,'' Gretchen Polhemus said
after she won the pageant Tuesday night.
   The 23-year-old cattle broker and real estate agent from Fort
Worth said she thought her runner-up, Jill Scheffert of Oklahoma
City, was the winner.
   Richard Guy, director of the Texas USA pageant, said the state's
fifth winning entry in the Miss USA Pageant just showed that
``classy, elegant, today women'' are victorious.
   Guy was in the Texas cheering section waving a Lone Star flag.
   He and his partner, Rex Holt, have developed into pageant gurus,
coaching the last five Texas contestants, as well as the 1977 Texas
entry, to victory through their agency, Guyrex Associates.
   Guyrex last week was featured on an ABC-TV ``20-20'' segment that
detailed the rigorous training given winning contestants represented
by the agency.
   A ``20-20'' team was filming Guy again Tuesday night.
   Miss Polhemus was crowned at the conclusion of a dazzling,
internationally televised two-hour production on CBS from the Mobile
Civic Center. Dick Clark and Angie Dickinson served as masters of
ceremonies.
   ``I'm so proud of her,'' Miss Polhemus' mother, Pat, said,
hugging a ``lucky'' stuffed toy cow.
   Prizes and gifts amounting to $200,000 goes with the title.
   The other finalists, besides Miss Oklahoma, were Miss New Jersey
Deborah Lee Husti; Miss Louisiana Elizabeth Primm; and Miss Georgia
Michele Nemeth.
   After the winner was crowned, the contestants went to a
coronation ball.
   Fifty-one women from each state and the District of Columbia
competed.
   Miss Polhemus said she will pursue an entertainment career while
continuing her real estate and livestock businesses in Fort Worth.
   The program was highlighted by a dance number with broadway star
Tommy Tune and the 51 contestants stepping to ``Is It True What They
Say About Dixie?''
   Miss Polhemus inherited the crown from Miss USA Courtney Gibbs,
22.
   The 11-member judging panel consisted of author Jude Deveraux;
modeling manager Bonnie Kay; Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, pilots of
the experimental Voyager aircraft; actress Stella Stevens; tennis
player Roscoe Tanner; Linda Shelton, an aerobics instructor; Lillian
Glass, author of ``Talk to Win''; actor Richard Anderson; Cecilia
Bolocco, Miss Universe 1987; and former Olympic diver Jennifer
Chandler.

<HEAD>Measles Hit Some Colleges Hard, But Outbreaks Are Scattered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Measles has hit some colleges this winter, but
federal health officials said outbreaks of the disease normally
associated with childhood are scattered and no cause for great alarm.
   Students lined up for measles vaccine last week at the C.W. Post
campus of New York's Long Island University, and free inoculations
were offered this week at the University of Texas.
   A measles outbreak caused Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C., to
cancel its basketball season and Ohio's Kent State University
stopped sending nursing students to local hospitals for fear of
giving patients measles.
   ``We're definitely having measles outbreaks right now, but it is
unfortunately nothing new,'' said Dr. Diane Simpson of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control's immunization division. ``We do get
outbreaks on college campuses and high school campuses (each year).''
   Most states require children to be inoculated for measles before
entering school, but some still reach college without immunity.
   In some cases, Simpson said, the vaccine doesn't take; in others,
colleges may not have required proof of immunization.
   At C.W. Post, where 19 cases were reported as of Monday,
immunization rules are now being strictly enforced, said spokeswoman
Mary Ring.
   Measles cases at Siena College in New York and the University of
Hartford in Connecticut prompted the East Coast Athletic Conference
to ban spectators from the scheduled March 9-11 basketball
tournament.
   Measles can be transmitted easily at colleges because of close
living quarters, said Valerie Cox, assistant director for nursing
services at the University of Texas.
   Only three cases have been reported at the University of Texas,
but 154 cases were reported recently in Lubbock, many of them in
public schools and at Texas Tech University, where the outbreak
prompted immunization of 5,200 students.
   The CDC also reported measles at Bradley University in Illinois.
   Through last week, 244 measles cases had been reported nationwide
since Jan. 1, up from 204 at the same time last year, according to
CDC statistics.
   But Simpson said those figures may not reflect the recent college
outbreaks or other recent outbreaks among younger children.
   Measles, or rubeola, is usually marked by a rash, fever, cough,
congestion, and red, sensitive eyes. Complications can occur without
proper treatment.
   In the late 1970s, CDC measles specialists believed the once
common childhood disease could be eradicated in the United States by
fall 1982, but in the last six years, 1,497 to 6,282 cases have been
reported annually.

   The ethics investigation of House Speaker Jim
Wright was expanded to include an allegation that he threatened to
expose a federal thrift regulator's homosexuality unless Texas
thrift executives gained access to Washington officials, The
Washington Times reported today.
   Wright said through a spokesman the allegation was
``preposterous,'' the newspaper said.
   The Times quoted sources as saying Wright was accused of
threatening federal officials in Washington with ``blowing the
whistle'' on a federal thrift regulator's alleged homosexuality
unless Texas thrift executives were allowed to meet with Washington
officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Executives of at least two Texas savings and loan associations
felt they could not get fair hearings at the bank board's Dallas
office, where the federal official in question worked, the Times
said. The Texas thrift executives were complaining of
over-regulation, and some of them were friends of the speaker, the
newspaper said.
   Wright's spokesman, Mark Johnson, told the newspaper, ``The
speaker never threatened to expose anything. It's a figment of
someone's imagination, someone with an obvious ax to grind.''
   Wright has been investigated by the House Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct since last fall regarding alleged attempts to
influence federal regulators on behalf of several Texas savings and
loan executives. He also has been accused of accepting a Fort Worth
condominium at a price below market value, of ordering a member of
his staff to work on his book and of using the book's royalties to
skirt limits on outside income.
   Wright has denied any wrongdoing. A report was submitted to the
House ethics panel last week by its counsel, and the panel must
decide whether it believes any of the charges were substantiated.
   The Times said the new allegation was brought to the committee's
attention in December or January.

<HEAD>Public TV Station Plans Service To Make Television Vivid For The
Blind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public television station has developed a service
that makes TV vivid for the blind and visually impaired by having a
narrator describe a program's setting and action during pauses in
dialogue.
   The service, developed by Boston's WGBH-TV, which also pioneered
closed captions for the hearing impaired 15 years ago, broadcasts
the added narration over a special channel that can be tapped by
people with a stereo television or a video cassette recorder.
   The station tested the service last year and is seeking funding
to make it available in January 1990 to the nation's estimated 12
million visually impaired people.
   ``I never realized when I watched television, from a listening
perspective, that I was missing so much,'' Kim Charlson recalled
Tuesday. Blind since the age of 11, the 31-year-old Watertown
resident was among thousands of visually impaired people across the
country who tuned to the service's trial run.
   Television ``is a major means of communication in society,'' Mrs.
Charlson said. ``There's so much on television, you tend to feel
left out when you can't access it. I really commend them that
they're trying to do it, and do it right.''
   Descriptive Video Services allows anyone with visual impairment _
or even sighted people stepping away from their TV set _ to follow
the show. With a stereo television set or VCR tuned to the Separate
Audio Program channel, they can hear a narrator describe a program's
scene and action during musical interludes or breaks in dialogue.
   WGBH enlisted nine other public TV stations to test the service
from January to July 1988 on the PBS ``American Playhouse'' drama
series.
   A viewer tuned to the play ``Lemon Sky,'' for example, could hear
as the credits rolled: ``A mountain silhouette in the distance, palm
trees closer. A boy's bike between a high, brown wooden fence. In
the foreground a white, mid-'50s convertible gleaming in the sun,
its top down.''
   Then later, after a character spoke his lines: ``He strolls away
from the car toward the house, pausing in the doorway.''
   ``I see it as something that can become widely popular and should
be,'' said John De Witt, who evaluates high-tech aides for the blind
at the American Federation for the Blind in New York.
   ``It's not a question only of people who are totally blind,'' De
Witt said in a telephone interview. ``There are millions of people
who have very poor vision and cannot see small details on the
screen, people who are losing their vision at any time of life.''
   The establishment of the Separate Audio Program channel about
five years ago makes the new television service possible. About 10
percent of American homes can tap the audio channel now, and Laurie
Everett, director of Descriptive Video Services, predicted access to
the channel would be common by the turn of the century.
   ``In a couple of years you won't be able to buy a television that
isn't stereo,'' she said.
   WGBH is trying to raise $300,000 to launch the service nationally
five hours a week and needs $1 million annually to keep it going,
Ms. Everett said.

<TEXT>
   Operators of two bookstores where
firebombings may be linked to sales of ``The Satanic Verses''
pledged not to stop selling the book despite the violence, which
caused modest damage but no injuries.
   Bookstores throughout the country have been threatened if they
carry the book that Moslems call blasphemous. The bombings at Cody's
and Waldenbooks in Berkeley and at a weekly newspaper in New York
City early Tuesday were the first signs of violence in the United
States.
   At eight bookstores in Santa Barbara in Southern California,
employees opening for business Tuesday found crudely worded, poorly
typed notes warning that something ``bad'' would happen to
shopowners selling the novel. The notes were signed ``American
Moslems.''
   Cody's owner Andy Ross found no such threat, but he said he had
little doubt the firebombings were connected to the novel that
prompted Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini to issue a death order for the
Moslem author, Salman Rushdie, and the book's publishers.
   ``I can't imagine any other reason why people would be lobbing
bombs through bookstores _ Cody's or anyone's,'' said Ross.
   But Ross reiterated an announcement issued last week that the
store wouldn't give in to pressure.
   ``We do not have it now, but we will be selling it,'' he said
while surveying the damage to his shop, a landmark dating from the
1960s Free Speech movement that originated in Berkeley.
   Waldenbooks manager Bob Gammon also had no plan to halt his order
for the book, although he might if he received threats or feared for
public safety. He said there was no evidence that the book was to
blame for the bombings. Waldenbooks sold out ``Verses'' the day
after the Khomeini's threat, he said.
   In New York, an incendiary device was tossed through the window
of the Riverdale Press in the Bronx, heavily damaging the building,
authorities said. No one was inside at the time.
   The firebombing may have been in retaliation for an editorial the
paper ran last week supporting the right to read the novel, said
firefighter Tom McTigue.
   Four hours after the Molotov cocktail bombings at the Berkeley
bookshops, a pipe bomb was found in Cody's. It was destroyed by a
police bomb squad without further damage to the bookstore, said
police Lt. Michel De Latour.
   He said there were no suspects and few leads. One man, Brett
Rideout, 44, told officers he was sleeping in his van outside Cody's
when he heard crashing glass and a car race off.
   Workers spent the day repairing damage at Cody's, which was
limited to broken glass, a few scorched shelves and some damaged
books. Ross said he planned to leave a charred end case in place for
a while as a reminder of the incident.
   In Albany, N.Y., meanwhile, novelist William Kennedy recited the
first three pages of ``The Satanic Verses'' at a reading Rushdie was
to have attended at the State University of New York. Other writers
also read from the book and from the new novel, ``John Dollar,''
published by Rushdie's American wife, Marianne Wiggins.
   ``This is a solidarity movement to show that writers must be
allowed to find their admirers and their enemies'' without being
threatened, Kennedy told the 150 people who attended the reading.
   Iranian clerics have put a $5.2 million bounty on the 41-year-old
Rushdie's head and he is in hiding with his wife in Britain under
police guard.

<HEAD>Government Nazi Hunter Says 250 Major Suspects Being Investigated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of suspected Nazi war criminals
migrated to Australia after World War II and about 250 are under
active investigation for major atrocities, a government-appointed
Nazi hunter said today.
   Bob Greenwood, head of the Special Investigations Unit, told The
Associated Press he has more than 500 names on file, all immigrants
who took out citizenship when immigration formalities were virtually
non-existent.
   Greenwood previously had said his department was investigating
almost 400 names supplied by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Vienna,
Austria.
   He said he was shocked at the level of atrocities committed by
some people who now regard themselves as Australians.
   Most of the crimes Greenwood is investigating were committed by
Eastern Europeans, he said, refusing to go into detail.
   ``We have in excess of 540 people and about half, or 250, are
under active investigation,'' Greenwood said. ``We are dealing with
people who came to Australia after World War II, took out
citizenship or became longstanding residents, who had committed war
crimes.''
   The government enacted legislation last year to prosecute Nazi
war criminals but exempted Australian war veterans and Japanese.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke appointed Greenwood after a radio
program on the government-funded Australian Broadcasting Corp.
alleged that former Nazis sought refuge in Australia after 1945 and
were now living comfortably.
   Opposition Liberal Party member Peter Baume says he has found out
with the help of Australia's Freedom of Information Act that some of
the suspected war criminals are guilty of killing thousands of
people.
   The Brisbane Sun newspaper said Greenwood may be forced to seek
more time from Attorney-General Lionel Bowen to complete files on
Australian citizens suspected of committing wartime atrocities.
   He initially began investigating 70 names, but more were provided
by Wiesenthal, who spent part of the war in a Nazi death camp. The
newspaper said the first of 12 major prosecutions are expected in
June.
   Opponents of the War Crimes Act have argued that war crimes
trials would be too time-consuming and expensive. Critics also have
argued against the reliability of Soviet evidence in such exercises.
   Greenwood is due to report his findings within one month but he
told the Brisbane Sun newspaper, ``We still have a long way to go.''
   He said most suspects were from Europe's Baltic states and had
worked with the Nazi regime to carry out crimes against Jews, the
handicapped and others as part of Hitler's ``purification program.''
   Greenwood expressed shock at some of the atrocities.
   ``Australia accepted hundreds of thousands of people from all
over Europe, so some (alleged war criminals) obviously have come to
Australia,'' he said.
   ``In hindsight, there were not enough resources to adequately
screen immigrants. Australia was crying out for immigrants in the
immediate post-war years and just filling the ships to bring them to
Australia,'' which now has double the population of 16 million.
   Greenwood has traveled to the United States, Israel, Canada and
Britain to pursue his investigations.

<TEXT>
   California's Tinseltown may be the best
known Hollywood, but at least 11 others around the country don't
want their name to be taken in vain.
   Representatives of the other Hollywoods held a summit here
Tuesday to plot their opposition to the movie capital's attempt to
trademark the community's name and collect royalties for its use.
   ``They should just back off, honestly,'' said Mara Giulianti,
mayor of this seaside city of 125,000, just north of Miami. ``I
don't believe a make-believe Hollywood can compete with the things
we're doing.''
   Trademark opponents offered historical arguments, civic pride,
the U.S. Constitution and a bit of showmanship _ a 7-foot egret that
is this city's mascot _ to buttress their campaign to keep their
name in the public domain.
   The West Coast's Hollywood Chamber of Commerce applied in 1986
for a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and
comment will be accepted until March 18.
   Maria Chiaro, city attorney for Florida's Hollywood, said
opponents may seek an extension to force Hollywood, Calif., to prove
ownership of the name.
   A trademark would guarantee power to regulate promotional,
educational and legislative activity under the Hollywood name and
would allow the trademark holder to charge royalties, she said.
   Ms. Giulianti began uniting the other Hollywoods last week, and
representatives from Florida, Maryland, Alabama, Texas, New Mexico,
South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, Illinois and
Arkansas gathered here. They agreed to draft a resolution for a
joint fight and may form an unofficial sister cities program.
   ``We feel a protest loud and clear will be warranted,'' said the
mayor, wearing a rhinestone ``Hollywood'' pin in her jacket lapel.
   Rodney Thompson, a St. Mary's County commissioner from Hollywood,
Md., 50 miles south of Washington, D.C., said the trademark issue
``would have ramifications down the road which would be hard to
swallow.''
   ``Let's kindle the fire a little hotter because I'm hot,'' said
James Ross Dover of rural Hollywood in northeast Georgia.
``Hollywood vs. Hollywood. Let's see how the fight turns out. Right
now, it's looking a little better.''
   His unincorporated community was founded in 1807, which he
claimed makes it the oldest Hollywood in the United States. The name
Hollywood was registered with the Los Angeles County recorder 80
years later after having been adopted from an estate near Chicago
that is now part of Brookfield, Ill.
   Bill Welsh of the Hollywood, Calif., Chamber of Commerce said the
proposed trademark would merely help the chamber garner royalties
from the sale of souvenirs to pay for upkeep of attractions like the
1,800 stars in the Walk of Fame and the big, white Hollywood sign.
   ``We are not going to make them pay to use the name,'' said
Welsh. ``We have tried time and again to tell that lady (Hollywood,
Fla., Mayor Giulanti) and other people down there ... and we just
can't seem to get the point across.''
   But even some in Los Angeles expressed sympathy with the
trademark opponents. The Hollywood, Calif., Citizens Association has
suggested filing a counterclaim to the application.
   ``Do not make the name Hollywood synonymous with profit,'' the
association officers wrote. ``It would be a disservice to all
average citizens of Hollywoods everywhere who live and raise
families and proudly say, `Hooray for Hollywoods.'''

<HEAD>Scathing Criticism of Communist Party in Soviet Magazine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an attack unprecedented in the state-run press,
a prominent sociologist has accused the ruling Communist Party of
spreading ``political lies'' that have deceived the Soviet people
for generations.
   Igor M. Klyamkin's article in February's editions of Novy Mir
magazine comes as the Soviets prepare for next month's national
elections _ the first in which voters will have more than one
candidate to choose from.
   In an obvious reference to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's push
for ``democratization'' as part of his reform campaign, the author
asserts that genuine democracy will not be possible unless the 20
million-member party permits open dissent in its ranks.
   Klyamkin hints at the central paradox of Gorbachev's
``democratization'' push _ that it is occurring under the aegis of a
party that has declared itself society's sole legitimate ruler.
   The author does not openly call for the creation of a multiparty
system, but that seems the inescapable conclusion many will draw
from his criticism of anti-democratic practices he says the
Communist Party has engaged in starting from the days of Soviet
founder Vladimir I. Lenin.
   ``The major reason for lies starting to dominate society was that
the majority, whatever it was composed of, was fated to limit
interparty democracy and violate the rights of the minority. This
was discovered even when Lenin was still alive,'' Klyamkin wrote.
   ``The political lie,'' he said, ``leads to catastrophe when some
organization or group of people has a full monopoly on power and
information, where nobody can catch them deceiving others, or to put
it more simply _ when there is no democracy.''
   The article seems certain to fuel debate about the party's role
in political institutions being created this year as part of
Gorbachev's plan to define more clearly the responsibilities of
party and government.
   Later this month, Soviet voters are to elect a new 2,550-seat
Council of People's Deputies that will choose a more active Supreme
Soviet parliament and the country's president, the government
position held by Gorbachev, who also is party general secretary.
   Klyamkin said the political reforms are flawed by measures
``which even the most vivid imagination cannot call democratic.''
   The political changes give the party and other officially
recognized organizations the right to directly fill one third of the
seats in the new assembly and, unlike current practice, impose a
two-step system for the election of Supreme Soviet deputies, who
since 1937 have been directly chosen by voters but who will now be
elected by the Council of People's Deputies.
   ``There are no free elections yet, and I'm not sure that there
will be any soon,'' wrote Klyamkin, who works at the Institute of
Economics of the World Socialist System, a Kremlin think tank.
   He also said anti-democratic traditions in the party had not
palpably changed in the nearly four years that Gorbachev has been at
the helm and that open debate on major issues is still muzzled by
the quest for ``monolithic unity.''
   The article was the latest published by official media
criticizing the role of the party in society.
   In January, the Leningrad-based magazine Neva said Gorbachev's
campaign for economic and social change was being sabotaged by a
``new class'' of party and government bureaucrats, and that the
leadership was powerless to stop it.
   Despite the party's claim that it serves the people and is the
``vanguard of society,'' the average Soviet ``practically never had
access to the real levers of power and doesn't have it now either,''
biologist and plant director Sergei Y. Andreyev wrote in Neva.
   In a speech Friday in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, Gorbachev
used traditional formulas in describing the party he leads as the
``vanguard social force,'' but said it should be society's guide,
and not its commanding officer.

<HEAD>Woman Who Sent Letters To Fox Held; Woman Reappears at Letterman
House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who allegedly sent threatening letters to actor Michael
J. Fox was being held without bail, and a woman who had been charged
with trespassing at talk show host David Letterman's house was
arrested again for returning.
   In Los Angeles, a judge ruled that Tina M. Ledbetter, 26, poses a
risk to Fox and his pregnant wife, Tracy Pollan, in ordering her
held without bail Tuesday.
   She pleaded innocent to five felony counts of making terrorist
threats. Ledbetter had been free on $50,000 bail following her Feb.
3 arrest.
   In New Canaan, Conn., Margaret Ray was arrested Tuesday on
trespassing charges, marking the third time in recent months that
she has been apprehended inside Letterman's home.
   New Canaan police said they received a complaint of an ``unwanted
person'' in Letterman's home. Police said the complaint was not
filed by Letterman, the host of ``Late Night with David Letterman''
on NBC.
   Spokesmen for NBC and Letterman's manager, Jack Rollins, referred
all questions to New Canaan police.
   Ray, 36, was charged with first-degree criminal trespassing and
possession of marijuana. She was being held on $5,000 bond at the
New Canaan police station, pending arraignment today in Norwalk
Superior Court.
   Ray was arrested Friday for criminal trespassing when she was
found wandering in the foyer of Letterman's home.
   Superior Court Judge Edward Leavitt released her Monday on a
promise that she report twice a week to a bail commissioner and seek
further psychiatric treatment.
   Last spring Ray set up housekeeping in Letterman's home and was
arrested while driving his sports car after identifying herself to a
toll collector outside New York City as ``Mrs. David Letterman.'' In
September, Leavitt ordered Ray to undergo psychiatric treatment.
   Many of the more than 5,000 letters to Fox, signed ``Your No. 1
Fan,'' threatened that he and his wife would die if he didn't
divorce her, Deputy District Attorney Norm Shapiro said.
   Fox, who has won two Emmys for his portrayal as the conservative
son of liberal parents on NBC's ``Family Ties,'' hired a security
guard for himself and Miss Pollan.
   The letters began in February 1988, several months prior to Fox's
July 1988 marriage to Pollan, and they continued after the marriage,
said Al Albergate, a district attorney's office spokesman.
   A bail hearing is scheduled for March 7. Ledbetter faces up to
four years in state prison.

<HEAD>Hollywood's First Feature Film Has Debut 75 Years Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Movie buffs and preservationists celebrated
Hollywood's first feature film with a showing of the long-lost movie
in the barn where it was filmed 75 years ago.
   On hand for Tuesday night's screening of ``The Squaw Man'' was
Betty Lasky, daughter of Hollywood pioneer Jesse L. Lasky. He made
the 90-minute melodrama about a British aristocrat's adventures in
America with Cecil B. DeMille, and the two men went on to found
Paramount Pictures.
   ``I first saw ``The Squaw Man'' five or six years ago,'' said Ms.
Lasky. ``It had been lost until then. Mr. DeMille hunted for it for
years.''
   Found in a vault at MGM, the film starring Dustin Farnum now is
at the Library of Congress, which helped arrange the special
screening.
   The barn had been rented by Lasky and DeMille for $75 and now has
been transformed into the Hollywood Studio Museum. It's the only
museum in Hollywood devoted to film history and contains such
memorabilia as Ben Hur's chariot, Mary Pickford's makeup case and
Mabel Normand's traveling trunk.
   ``This building played a very important part in the evolution of
movies,'' said Hollywood Councilman Michael Woo.
   Dan Sartell, a former assistant to Lasky who came from his home
in Jamesville, Wis., said Lasky would be thrilled to see the film so
well preserved, but might be disappointed with the current state of
the industry.
   ``In those days, men made films,'' said Sartell. ``Now, it's all
corporations.''
   A three-man musical group played the original background music
for, ``The Squaw Man,'' in which a British aristocrat confronts the
wild West and marries an Indian woman.

<HEAD>Thousands Converge On Capital To Protest Alleged Persecution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 4,000 Kosovo Slavs and their
children converged on Belgrade today to protest alleged ethnic
persecution by the majority Albanians in the impoverished southern
region, the state Tanjug news agency said.
   The flag-carrying, chanting Serbs and Montenegrins jammed steets
and interrupted traffic as they walked from the railroad station to
the downtown parliament.
   Taxi drivers, brandishing pictures of the popular Serbian party
chief Slobodan Milosevic, gave free rides to the elderly.
   Speaking to a rally in the capital Tuesday that drew an estimated
500,000 people, Milosevic vowed to arrest the organizers of protests
and strikes by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo _ an autonomous province
of the Serbian republic.
   Serbs who support Milosevic believe the Albanians in Kosovo,
which was ancient Serbia's heartland, want to unite the province
with neighboring Albania. About 90 percent of Kosovo's people are
ethnic Albanians.
   Growing ethnic nationalism has created the greatest threat to
Yugoslav unity since the 1980 death of President Tito, whose
leadership held the disparate nation of 23 million people together.
   An economic crisis has combined with the resurgence of ethnic and
religious rivalries to threaten the loose confederation of six
republics and two provinces.
   The republics of Slovenia and Croatia support demands by ethnic
Albanians for guarantees that Kosovo's autonomy will not be
restricted. The two are Yugoslavia's most liberal and economically
advanced republics.
   Macedonia supports the Serbs, the largest ethnic group in
Yugoslavia.
   Kosovo was outwardly peaceful Tuesday, except for scattered
Serbian protests, under emergency measures imposed Monday after a
week of unrest among the province's 1.8 million people.
   Official Yugoslav media said about 1,000 Slavs had announced
plans to leave Kosovo immediately, alleging harassment by ethnic
Albanians.
   Meanwhile, 500 ethnic Albanians in the Trepca lead-zinc mine in
Kosovo continued their strike to protest Serbian plans to change the
constitution in a bid to win greater control over their province.
   On Monday, 1,300 ethnic Albanian miners came out from pits after
an eight-day sit-in that forced the resignation of three Kosovo
Communist Party leaders they consider pro-Serbian.
   Doctors from Croatia said the exhausted miners would be unable to
work for at least a week.
   Tanjug said peace prevailed this morning in Kosovo's capital of
Pristina, where additional military vehicles and soldiers had been
sent on Monday.
   But in Sarajevo, capital of the republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
2,000 students lent support to Milosevic's drive for more control
over Kosovo, and demanded the resignations of the three leaders be
rescinded.
   Thousands of workers in Macedonia also sided with Serbia in more
protests today and sent messages of support to Belgrade students
saying ``Sarajevo Is With You'' and ``Slovenia Is Lying,'' Tanjug
said.
   About 1,000 Slovenian intellectuals held an anti-Serbian protest
Tuesday in Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, and about 100,000
Slovenians have signed a petition against the emergency measures in
Kosovo.

<HEAD>91-Year-Old Man Released From Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 91-year-old man described by federal law
enforcement officials as a ``financial top man'' among bookies has
been freed despite his refusal to cooperate in a criminal
investigation.
   U.S. District Judge William G. Young ordered Harry ``Doc''
Sagansky released from the Plymouth County House of Correction on
Tuesday, reversing an earlier decision. He did not comment on the
decision.
   ``It feels good to be out,'' Sagansky said as he left with his
son. ``I'm just going to go home and have some dinner.''
   His lawyer, Morris M. Goldings, described Sagansky as suffering
from depression last week in asking the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to review the case. Goldings said the appeals court
suggested that Young review the case.
   In court papers, Sagansky said he feared ``bodily harm'' to
himself and his family if he answered a grand jury's questions about
a case involving the New England Organized Crime Task Force.
   At one point, Sagansky said he would rather die in jail than
share his knowledge with law enforcement officials.
   The FBI in June 1987 said that Sagansky and two men reputed to be
potential leaders in the Boston mob were targets of a racketeering
investigation. But Goldings said his client was being sought as a
witness and was not a target of investigators.
   Sagansky invoked the Fifth Amendment before a federal grand jury
on July 1, 1987, and declined to answer questions. He was later
granted immunity from prosecution but still refused to answer
questions.
   He was ordered jailed by Young on Feb. 3, 1988, after discussions
with federal prosecutors concerning the federal witness protection
plan fell through.

<DATELINE>NEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The once-secret ``Helga'' portfolio of
paintings and drawings by Andrew Wyeth is for sale for $40 million.
   Leonard E.B. Andrews, the Newtown Square publisher and art
collector who bought the 240 works from Wyeth in 1986, said Tuesday
that his intention had been to show the collection to the American
public, ``and we've done that in spades.''
   The collection consists of nudes and other portraits of Helga
Testorf, a neighbor of Wyeth's. The works were created in secret for
15 years and caught the art world's eye when Andrews bought them.
   When he purchased the collection, Andrews said only that he had
paid ``several million.'' Estimates of the price have varied from $6
million to $20 million. Andrews said Wyeth agreed never to reveal
the price tag.
   Andrews said Wyeth ``is aware of (the sale) and understands my
reasoning.'' He said his reasons for selling include the lack of
facilities to house the collection.
   Andrews said he intends to sell the collection intact and not
piecemeal. He said he has been approached by American and Japanese
interests.
   The Helga works have been exhibited to more than 1 million people
at six museums across the country during the past two years but were
not favorably received by many critics and scholars.
   They are to be displayed this summer at the Brooklyn Museum in
New York. The collection also is committed for exhibition in Japan
throughout 1990.

   The number of poor families with children is
growing rapidly, increasing the number of youngsters without proper
health care, the National Association of Children's Hospitals and
Related Institutions said today.
   In a report, the group predicted that by the end of the century
one-third of all American children will live below the poverty line,
and that youngsters from such families are at the highest risk for
poor health.
   ``The No. 1 key to the poor status of our nation's children
relative to their health is insurance, and ... we see that 12
million of them, one in every five, do not have insurance, either
public or private,'' William Considine, chairman of the association,
said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   He said the study's authors found that 7 million children do not
receive routine medical care from the ages of 1 to 4. The parents
delay care, he said, ``because they cannot access the care because
of the inability of insurance.''
   Thus, Considine added, ``those children do not come to our
childrens' hospitals throughout the country until their course (of
illness) is well-developed, and it's at a state where it's more
costly and the consequences already more developed and set in.''
   The report also noted:
   _Nearly 40,000 of the 3.8 million children born in 1987 in the
United States died before their first birthday.
   _Since 1979, nearly a quarter of all pregnant women received
little or no prenatal care.
   _Low birth-weight infants in the U.S. have remained at 6.8
percent of the infants born, in contrast to 4 percent in western
Europe.
   _Child abuse and neglect increased by 55 percent between 1981 and
1985.
   ``We seem to be exploiting our children much more than we're
nurturing our children,'' Considine said.
   _The rate of suicide among people aged 15 to 19 has doubled in
two decades.
   _Less than 60 percent of children under the age of four received
the complete basic series of immunizations in 1985, and cases of
mumps, measles and whooping cough have increased.
   ``Only about 75 percent of all our children 1 to 4 are being
immunized to measles before that age of 4,'' Considine said.
``That's a shocking statistic to us. We have the technology and the
talent. We're just not getting that to our children,'' Considine
said.
   _The number of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome among
children has doubled in the last year.
   _Every year, 1.1 million teen-aged girls become pregnant in the
United States.

   Fifty drug smugglers were hanged in Iran
today, the official Iranian news agency reported.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said those executed _ 48 men and
two women _ had been found guilty of possession and sale of more
than 70,000 pounds of narcotics. Some also had been convicted of
other crimes such as arms smuggling and theft, according to an
agency report monitored in Nicosia.
   IRNA said 14 executions took place in the capital, Tehran, and
the others in Kerman, Tabriz, Hamedan, Sabzevar, Nahavand, Shiraz,
Qom, Neishapur, Gonbad, Isfahan, Birjand, Mashhad and Bakhtaran.
   The executions are part of a nationwide crackdown on drugs. Since
a new anti-drug law went into effect Jan. 21, Iran has reported 225
executions of drug smugglers.
   The new law carries the death sentence for possession of small
quantities of drugs, and gives addicts six months to kick the habit
or face jail terms.
   Tehran radio, also monitored in Nicosia, reported earlier this
month that 1,750 addicts were rounded up in Iran's western provinces
in a 24-hour period.
   It said 7,358 addicts had been registered since the drug law took
effect.
   Iran's official media has estimated there are 1 million drug
addicts in Iran, which has a population of 50 million. Unofficial
estimates put the figure at 2 million addicts.

<TEXT>
   Whimsical poet Richard Armour, who wrote
thousands of pieces of verse that poked fun at everything in his
path _ from poets to catsup bottles _ has died at age 82.
   Armour, who died Tuesday in a convalescent home here after a
battle with Parkinson's disease, once said he developed a love of
words while studying ``10 dead or deadly languages'' for his Ph.D.
in English in Harvard.
   A professor at Scripps College here, Armour once said he wore two
costumes: the cap and gown of the academician and the cap and bells
of a clown.
   He published 65 books, most of which featured at least some of
his more than 10,000 published poems. He also contributed to more
than 200 magazines in the United States and England, including the
New Yorker and Saturday Evening Post, and wrote a syndicated
newspaper column, ``Armour's Armory.''
   His aim as a writer, he once said, was to ``sum up in four lines
what a pedant would call a universal truth _ and to leave it
writhing.''
   About poetry he wrote:
   
   That poem is a splendid thing.
   I love to hear you quote it.
   I like the thought, I like the swing.
   I like it all. (I wrote it).
   
   His poems also explored the everyday:
   
   Shake and shake
   The catsup bottle.
   None will come,
   And then a lot'll.

<HEAD>Boxcars Bringing Nuclear Waste to Idaho After Four-Month Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two boxcars loaded with radioactive waste were en
route today from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant to a
temporary storage site in Idaho, relieving a waste buildup that
threatened to close the plant.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, who in October closed his state to
shipments of radioactive waste, lifted his ban on Thursday. He said
he would allow two boxcars a month for six months to unload at the
Department of Energy's Idaho National Energy Laboratory in Idaho
Falls.
   Andrus cited national security interests. Rocky Flats, operated
for the Department of Energy by Rockwell International, produces
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.
   The plant 17 miles from Denver could have been shut down as early
as this month. Gov. Roy Romer in October threatened to close it when
it reached its waste storage capacity.
   The boxcars, which Rocky Flats spokesman Ed Heintz said left
Tuesday for a trip that takes seven to nine days, contained 150
cubic yards of clothing and equipment contaminated with small
amounts of plutonium.
   ``We're real pleased to get it out,'' Heintz said. ``This gives
us another six months' breathing room to work on a permanent
solution with DOE and Congress.''
   Before Tuesday, 1,332 cubic yards of waste had piled up at the
plant, which is under a state-imposed limit of 1,601 cubic yards of
storage.
   One hundred-fifty cubic yards is about a month's worth of waste
generated under current plant production levels. When Rocky Flats is
operating at full capacity, it generates 200 to 250 cubic yards of
waste each month.
   Last week, Romer said he would allow Rocky Flats to continue
operations until late this year, depending on how much waste is
generated there.
   Romer and Andrus are pushing Department of Energy officials to
meet a target date of Sept. 1 for the opening of the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M., for permanent storage of nuclear
waste.

   Four gunmen kidnapped a Japanese businessman in
Vientiane, Laos, early today after breaking into his home and tying
up his wife and two maids, government officials said.
   Yoshiaki Asao, 61, branch manager of Mitsui and Co.'s Vientiane
office, was abducted, a company spokesman quoted Asao's wife as
saying.
   Goverment sources said four men participated in the kidnapping,
none of them Japanese.
   The company spokesman, Shuzo Uematsu, said no one has claimed
responsibility, nor had the company received any threats beforehand.
   At a news conference at Mitsui's Tokyo office, Uematsu said the
company contacted Asao's wife, Michiko, and confirmed the
kidnapping, but communication was too poor to learn details.
   Government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Mrs. Asao and the two maids were not injured.
   It was the second kidnapping of an overseas Mitsui executive in
three years.
   Nobuyuki Wakaoji, the company's Manila branch manager, was
kidnapped in the Philippines in November 1986 and released in March
1987. The company reportedly paid a ransom for his release.
   Last year, police said the Japanese Red Army, a terrorist
organization, had kidnapped Wakaoji.
   In the past four years, at least four Japanese have been abducted
abroad, including Wakaoji.
   Japan established diplomatic relations with Laos in 1976 and has
donated more development aid to Laos than other Western countries.
In fiscal 1987, Japanese aid to Laos reached $13.7 million.

   Aircraft manufacturers will be hard-pressed to
meet the anticipated demand for new planes to replace aging
jetliners, industry analysts say.
   The Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie already
have ``interesting challenges ahead'' in meeting the ``delivery
commitments already made,'' said Wolfgang H. Demisch of Union Bank
of Switzerland in an interview from New York.
   Some models ordered today won't be delivered until 1996, he said.
   ``At this point, pouring more orders into the funnel isn't going
to make more airplanes come out at the bottom,'' said Demisch. ``The
greater risk is that in this rush suppliers will be overstretched
and can't deliver as quickly as expected. Already there are
components in tight supply, and that's not going to get much
easier.''
   With the joint government-industry Aging Aircraft Task Force
recommending that the Federal Aviation Administration order $800
million in maintenance, analysts predicted the pressure to replace
older planes will increase.
   Paul H. Nisbet of Prudential-Bache said airlines saw the need to
replace planes several years ago as maintenance costs began rising.
   ``I think a lot of orders seen in the last two or three years
have been for replacement,'' Nisbet said. ``Before that, orders were
just for traffic growth.''
   Nisbet said he expected 600 to 700 new plane orders annually over
the next few years, including as many as 200 to 300 to replace older
planes.
   Boeing's stock has held firm in the $60 range during the latest
incident involving a plane it built, a United Airlines 747 in which
the fuselage tore open after takeoff from Honolulu to New Zealand on
Friday.
   Nine passengers were sucked to their deaths from the plane.
Investigators have focused on a cargo door as a likely cause of the
incident.
   George Shapiro of Salomon Brothers in New York said consumers
haven't blamed carriers or Boeing for the accident, the recent crash
of a British Midland Airways 737 that killed 44 or the Aloha
Airlines 737 that ripped open in April, sending a flight attendant
to her death.
   ``There's no question Boeing is going through a string of
unfortunate troubles, from crashes, holes developing in its planes
in flight, and with quality problems on new aircraft,'' he said,
``but Boeing has more planes out there than any other manufacturer
and they are getting older.''
   Boeing officials have denied any connection between the recent
spate of incidents.

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Called By Guerrilla Group As Peace Commission Begins Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest guerrilla group has
declared a unilateral cease-fire in the latest bid to end an
insurgency that has claimed 76,000 lives in the last quarter-century.
   Jacobo Arenas, leader of the leftist Colombian Revolutionary
Armed Forces, declared in a recorded message broadcast over radio
nationwide that the cease-fire began at 6 p.m. Tuesday.
   While no incidents had been reported early today, President
Virgilio Barco's administration has expressed pessimism about the
chances of stopping the insurrection.
   Right-wing death squads have sprung up in response to the leftist
guerrillas, and the rightists have been blamed for killing at least
1,000 people in the last three years.
   Also on Tuesday, a peace commission in Bogota began work toward a
general cease-fire to the insurrection, which has claimed 76,000
lives in the past 76 years.
   Raul Orejuela Buena, minister of government, said last week the
guerrillas were manipulating the Roman Catholic church-sponsored
commission and it had little more chance of success than the last
president, Belisario Betancur, experienced in pursuing a cease-fire.
   Betancur's government negotiated a truce with most of the
estimated 10,000 guerrillas in Colombia's five guerrilla armies, but
it collapsed under the weight of accusations by rebels and security
forces.
   Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, a former president from Barco's Liberal
Party, on Tuesday rejected the government minister's criticism of
the commission.
   ``Trying to save human lives and put an end to the spilling of
blood, I am disposed to hear all those of good faith and even bad
faith who might have something to suggest,'' he said in a statement.
   Two other rebel groups, the April 19 Movement and the Quintin
Lame, said last month they would like to begin peace talks, but the
remaining two have shown no inclination to negotiate.
   One, the People's Revolutionary Army, claimed responsibility for
a bomb that exploded Monday at the Bogota offices of an American
missionary group, the Summer Institute of Linguistics of
Duncanville, Texas.
   The National Liberation Army has said it will never stop fighting.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Coleman Young vetoed an ordinance offering
shelter in municipal buildings to thousands of homeless people,
calling it unnecessary, costly and potentially damaging to Detroit's
convention business.
   Tuesday's veto came a day after the City Council voted 8-0 to use
municipal buildings to provide shelter, heat, restrooms and security
for homeless people for 60 days.
   The ordinance would have opened up Recreation Department
buildings, the vacant Detroit General Hospital, Ford Auditorium and
a Civic Center meeting place where an estimated 40,000 people are
attending a convention of automotive engineers.
   ``To begin with, more effective and responsible plans for the
homeless already have been and are being implemented,'' Young said
in a statement. ``In addition, this ordinance is so broad and
far-reaching as to be unworkable.
   ``It would cost over $2 million to operate, it would seriously
curtail vital neighborhood programs run by the Recreation Department
and Police Athletic League, and it would seriously damage our
ability to bring meetings and conventions and the thousands of jobs
they create to the Civic Center,'' he said.
   Young said existing shelters had beds available every night and
that the city's Homeless Intervention Program has placed 400
homeless families in permanent housing. But advocates for the
homeless disputed that claim.
   ``We don't have any records of him placing anybody, and
especially not ... 400 people,'' said Theresa Smith, spokeswoman for
the Detroit-Wayne County Union of the Homeless. ``He's not done half
of what he says he's done.''
   Councilman Clyde Cleveland said Tuesday he expects the Council to
attempt to override Young's veto.
   Cleveland said he had not reviewed Young's veto message and could
not comment on it. He also would not predict whether an override
would succeed.
   Estimates of the number of homeless people in the nation's
sixth-largest city range from 12,000 to 60,000 out of a population
of 1.1 million.

<HEAD>Iraq Denounces Amnesty Report on Child Torture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Iraqi News Agency today
denounced a report by Amnesty International that said the children
of political prisoners have been tortured, abused and imprisoned in
Iraq.
   INA quoted an unidentified editor as calling the report by the
international human rights organization ``cheap allegations'' in an
``anti-Iraqi propaganda campaign.''
   The editor pointed to the planned political reforms announced by
President Saddam Hussein to dispute the charges.
   ``These lies aired by enemy circles come at a time when Iraq
announces its serious efforts through continuous meetings of the
political leadership to set the permanent constitution of the
country and to permit ... political parties ... and press freedom,''
said the report, which was monitored in Nicosia.
   Hussein has said political parties will be permitted and has
encouraged the press to be more critical.
   The new laws have not been announced, but former opposition
parties such as the Islamic Call and the communists will not be
permitted on the ground they had dealings with Iran, Iraq's foe in
the eight-year Persian Gulf war.
   The editor said Iraqi children get free education, health care
and social security.
   Amnesty International issued a report on Tuesday saying that
``children and young people have become the innocent victims of a
policy of political repression'' in Iraq.
   It said opponents of Hussein's government have sometimes had to
pay for their activities with ``the welfare _ and sometimes the
lives _ of their children'' between 1983 and 1988.
   Children as young as five months old have been imprisoned, and
hundreds have disappeared, the report said.

<HEAD>Likud Takes Labor Strongholds; Kollek Re-elected</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with more comments from Shamir and Peres,
dispute over vote count in mayor's race in Haifa. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The right-wing Likud bloc upset the Labor Party
in nationwide municipal elections, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
said today the voting indicates Israelis support Likud's anti-PLO
policies.
   Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader and finance minister,
insisted Tuesday's balloting had nothing to do with the Palestinian
issue and said he was willing to hold a separate referendum on the
subject.
   Other Labor leaders demanded a shakeup to halt a decline in their
party's standing since November, when Likud won the premiership in
national elections.
   Political analysts said the results showed Labor's historic
dominance of the grass-roots level had eroded.
   In a key race of Tuesday's election, Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek
was re-elected for a sixth term. But he lost control of the city
council as religious parties increased their representation to
nearly half the city council.
   The biggest gains were made by such ultra-Orthodox parties as
Shas, Agudat Israel and Degel Hatorah. Their success will probably
give them more power than the traditional, more moderate Orthodox
parties.
   The religious gains also could fuel tensions between secular and
observant Jews in the city, because Kollek will need to enlist the
support of the ultra-Orthodox to govern, Israeli news reports said.
   But the 77-year-old Kollek, who has been in office since 1965,
said he still expected to control the city. ``I will ... give other
people an ulcer instead of getting one myself,'' he said.
   Shlomo Lahat, Likud mayor of Tel Aviv, also won re-election.
   The results in Haifa, where Labor Mayor Aryeh Gurel was in a
tight race with his Likud rival, were uncertain after a dispute
developed today over the counting of ballots, Israel radio reported.
   Likud appeared to have won several Labor strongholds, including
the southern port of Ashdod and the town of Beersheba in the Negev
Desert.
   Israel and army radio said Likud also won several communities
around Tel Aviv that Labor had held, including Holon, Petach Tikvah
and Ramat Gan.
   Ultra-Orthodox religious parties scored gains throughout the
country, repeating their success of the November general elections,
according to unofficial results based on 43 percent of the vote.
   At stake were 147 local councils and mayoralities. In the last
national municipal elections in 1983, Labor won in 54 towns,
compared to 26 taken by Likud. The remainder went to local slates or
religious parties.
   Shamir, who had billed the elections as a referendum on Israel's
refusal to negotiate peace with the PLO, said on Israel radio the
results ``will signal to various people in the world, so they know
who is dominant in the Israeli political system, who is the one who
determines, who has the stronger voice.''
   ``There is no doubt that the elections ... show Likud is getting
stronger and at the same time the majority ... supports its
political positions.''
   Peres acknowledged in a radio interview that Labor ``has
definitely been dealt a blow, and I don't want to underestimate its
force.''
   But he disputed claims the results showed wide public support for
Likud's views on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Officially both Labor and Likud oppose Palestine Liberation
Organization participation in peace talks, based on a claim that it
is a terrorist organization. But there are growing calls inside
Labor to reconsider this policy now that PLO chairman Yasser Arafat
has said he renounces terrorism and recognizes Israel's right to
exist.
   Labor leaders, including Peres aides, have met recently with
prominent Palestinians in the occupied territories who are known to
be PLO supporters.
   Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of Labor said his party's losses
were a further sign of the decline of the party that has failed to
win any of the last four general elections. On the national level,
Labor and Likud have been governing in an uneasy coalition since
1984, with neither party able to score an outright victory in
general elections.
   About 48 percent of Israel's 2.7 million voters went to the polls
on Tuesday, down from 55 percent in 1983. Voters cast two ballots,
one for mayor and the second for a party slate for city council.
   In Jerusalem, Kollek won 64 percent, while his slate received 12
of 31 council seats, down from 17. Religious parties, meanwhile,
increased their seats from 10 to 15.
   Kollek lost his majority in part because of the boycott of east
Jerusalem's 80,000 Arab voters, traditionally Kollek backers. Fewer
than 2 percent went to the polls, compared to 18 percent in 1983.
   The boycott was ordered by the PLO-allied leadership of the
15-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip. The leaders called a general strike
Tuesday to enforce the order and urged Palestinians to punish those
who ignored the boycott.
   In the Arab sector, Islamic fundamentalists ousted the communist
leadership of the second-largest city, Umm el Fahem, causing concern
that anti-Israeli sentiment is spreading among Israeli Arabs.

   For decades, Venezuelans dreamed that
oil would cure the economic woes of their petroleum-rich country.
   That illusion, held even after oil prices began to plummet,
appears to have ended with the worst violence in Venezuela in 31
years.
   Increases of 30 percent to 50 percent in public transport tariffs
and price gouging by bus drivers acted as a detonator for an economy
in rapid deterioration.
   The slide in the price of oil, which accounts for 90 percent of
Venezuelan export revenue, coupled with a suffocating $33 billion
foreign debt.
   The nation pocketed an estimated $9 billion in oil revenues last
year, compared to $19 billion in 1981.
   Inflation this year is expected to reach 70 percent, up from 35
percent last year.
   President Carlos Andres Perez, who took power three weeks ago,
announced a sweeping economic reform package intended to breathe
life into the stagnant economy and persuade international bankers to
increase loans to the country.
   Some of those reforms included freeing interest rates, doubling
gasoline prices, and establishing a free-floating currency with a
consequent increase in the price of imports.
   The violence that erupted across the nation Monday showed the
difficulty the government will have implementing the economic
reforms.
   The reforms were backed by the International Monetary Fund, from
which Perez hopes to obtain a $1.5 billion short-term loan.
   Until now, Venezuela had avoided turning to the IMF for a
bailout. Perez himself called the organization the equivalent of
``economic totalitarianism.'' Venezuela has 18 million inhabitants
and was for years an island of tranquility in a sea of regional
violence, political instability and economic recession.
   Under Perez's first administration, from 1973 to 1978, oil prices
boomed and the country enjoyed an unparalleled prosperity. There was
full employment and inflation did not break single digits.
   Those memories were enough to guarantee Perez a landslide victory
in the election Dec.4, say political experts.
   ``Perez evoked for Venezuelans a bonanza, and now they've had a
rude awakening,'' said sociologist and university professor Anibal
Romero.
   Romero said he did not believe the disturbances threatened
Venezuela's democracy, saying the country had lived through worst
crises, including guerrilla movements in the 1960s.
   Jose Vicente Rangel, former leftist presidential candidate and
congressman, said the riots represented ``the beginnings of an end
of an era, of a style of life.''
   ``It's the breaking of the illusion that all politicians had that
this could never happen here. It did happen indeed, and it's proof
of the impoverishment of the country. We're not used to inflation,''
he said.

   The elephants of Point Defiance Zoo are
getting bigger homes at a $1.5 million cost, improvements
necessitated largely by a profoundly problematic pachyderm named
Cindy, the zoo director says.
   Cindy, a 24-year-old from Asia, is returning after six years on
loan to the San Diego Wild Animal Park. In fact, the San Diego zoo
is pleading with Tacoma officials to hasten Cindy's return, said zoo
director Tom Otten.
   It isn't so much that the four-ton Cindy wouldn't mate with any
of the bull elephants in San Diego, but three weeks ago she broke a
handler's collarbone with a slap of her trunk.
   ``From time to time, Cindy has made aggressive motions toward
keepers she doesn't like, and that's most of our keepers,'' said
Joel Edelstein of the San Diego zoo. ``We wouldn't fight the
decision to let her go.''
   The return has added urgency to the need to build bigger elephant
barns, using money from a prior bond issue.
   Otherwise, Otten said, ``We'll have to go out of the elephant
business.''
   Moyo and Thandi, the zoo's 8-year-old female African elephants,
also could use larger quarters, Otten said.
   Part of the plan is for construction this summer of a special
yard for Cindy with an elephant ``crush,'' a hydraulic steel device
to contain the animal while trainers trim toenails and tusks,
administer medication and take blood and fluid samples.
   The San Diego zoo does not have such a device, so trainers must
rely on each other to keep elephants still.

   Trains loaded with snow have been rattling
into this usually frozen capital in a costly battle to create the
winter that wasn't and save an annual tradition.
   A record warm winter threatened to melt away the Holmenkollen Ski
Festival, which begins Thursday, so organizers hauled in 5,600 tons
of snow by rail at about 1.5 cents a pound to rescue the event.
   ``Snow costs about the same per pound as wholesale sugar,'' said
Knut Almquist, secretary general of the Association for Promotion of
Skiing, which has organized the annual festival since 1892.
   Oslo and southern Norway experienced the mildest January ever
recorded. State meteorologist Oernulf Fremming said January was a
balmy 28 degrees above normal, and Oslo's February's average of 36.7
degrees was nearly 12 degrees warmer than the month's normal average
temperature of 24.8 degrees.
   The nice weather has left the Holmenkollen ski jump and
cross-country trail near Oslo without snow as its annual highpoint
approached _ four days of World Cup competitions that begin Thursday.
   Two of the week's major events, a World Cup 90-meter ski jump and
the annual ``Monolith'' cross-country ski race in Oslo's Frogner
Park have already been canceled.
   The state railroad NSB was hired to scoop up mountain snow from
the center of the country and ship it 186 miles by flatcar to
Holmenkollen.
   Railroaders joked that snow might be a important new cash crop.
   A giant Boeing Chinook twin-rotor helicopter had been slated to
carry flakes aloft and create its own blizzard above Holmenkollen,
but was grounded by fog, Almquist said.
   A lack of snow has not stopped Holmenkollen ski jumpers since
1925, and the association will do almost anything to save the event,
he said.
   ``It would cost more to cancel than to ship snow. Our insurance
pays for covering the ski area in snow but not for cancelling or
moving the event,'' he said of the more than $150,000 snow purchase.
   ``We'll take care of the snow if only nature will arrange the
cold weather,'' he said.
   High temperatures and a steady drizzle had threatened to wash
away transplanted snow _ but more recent colder weather and snow
flurries have raised hopes, he said.
   Tuesday's high in Oslo was 41 degrees, the low 36.
   The warm spell has left Norway's ski manufacturers, southern
resorts and even the ski association strapped for cash but brought
the railroad a windfall.
   ``We wouldn't mind seeing more ski races like this. It's great
for business,'' joked Per Kristian Flaten of NSB. ``We really do
hope the jumps and races go as planned after everyone's efforts.''
   NSB's Olav Hollerud, who engineered the snow lift, said 13 trains
have hauled 300 flatcars, each carrying 18.7 tons of snow, from the
mountains.

   William J. Bennett didn't quite hit the lottery
after resigning as education secretary last September, but he came
close, more than quadrupling his assets by speaking and writing.
   Bennett, nominated by President Bush to lead the government's war
on illegal drugs, says he now has assets of $460,630. In contrast, a
financial disclosure form submitted on his status as last Sept. 20
reflected assets ranging from $51,000 to $107,000.
   Bennett says he has set aside $130,000 this year for federal
income tax.
   According to financial statements Bennett submitted to the Senate
Judiciary Committee and the White House, he has cash on hand and in
banks totaling $340,500 plus personal property worth $28,000, a
savings plan worth $11,000 and a retirement annuity worth $81,000.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee opened confirmation hearings today
on Bennett's nomination to be director of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy.
   Bennett earned almost $240,000 from 24 speaking engagements that
brought him up to $14,000 per lecture, the statements show.
   In addition, Bennett said he has received $187,500 as an advance
payment from Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. against royalties on two books he
agreed to write in a contract signed last October.
   He is to receive $93,750 on delivery and acceptance of each of
the two manuscripts, and he is to receive royalties on the books
when they exceed the amount advanced to him, according to the
statements.
   ``I plan to complete work on the first book before I enter
government service,'' Bennett said, but he won't be able to write
the second one, which was to be completed within a year after the
first is done.
   That part of the contract is being renegotiated, but Bennett's
attorney, Bob Barnett of the Washington law firm of Williams &amp;
Connolly, refused to say Tuesday whether Bennett planned to return
any of the advance to Simon &amp; Schuster.
   ``We're still in the process of renegotiating the contract,''
Barnett said, adding that it should be completed by the end of the
week. He said details of the new agreement would be filed with the
Office of Government Ethics.
   Bennett also earned $44,670 in salary from The Madison Center, a
policy group that he created with $500,000 in start-up funds from
The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation of Milwaukee.
   Bennett has agreed that if he is confirmed as drug director, he
will disqualify himself from any matter involving Simon &amp; Schuster,
The Madison Center, the Bradley Foundation, the Aspen Institute for
Humanistic Studies, the Kraft Foundation and Georgetown University,
said Arnold Intrater, general counsel for the office of
administration in the executive office of the president.
   Bennett's wife, Elayne, works for a project housed at Georgetown
University but funded by the Bradley Foundation, according to
Bennett's disclosure form.
   In addition, he has agreed to resign from numerous positions with
non-profit foundations: president of The Madison Center, member of
the board of directors of the Bradley Foundation, the Institute for
Educational Affairs and the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge,
Pa., as well as a consultant to the Aspen Institute and the Kraft
Foundation, an adviser to the Free Congress Foundation and a member
of the board of advisers for the Center for Security Policy.
   In 1988, Bennett earned $12,500 as director of the Kraft
Foundation, $10,000 as director of the Aspen Institute and $1,250 as
director of the Bradley Foundation.
   Frank Q. Nebeker, director of the government ethics office, said
in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, ``We believe that Mr.
Bennett is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations
governing conflicts of interest.''
   However, that was contingent on Bennett's agreement to resign
from all outside positions and receive counseling from an ethics
official to assure that he does not use government time and
resources to complete his book or keep his former associations.
   The government ethics office didn't have much time to review the
form. The office received the form last Friday and approved it the
same day.

   About 40 people driven from their homes by a
freight train wreck were allowed back early today, ending the second
evacuation in two days.
   Investigators said speed, rough track and a faulty car may have
been factors in the 21-car derailment Sunday in which two tankers
containing 25,000 gallons of highly flammable butane caught fire and
forced the evacuation of 2,000 people.
   Hours after residents were allowed back in their homes Tuesday, a
tanker jumped the tracks again as it was being moved, causing no
fire but prompting another evacuation that ended after the car was
moved to a rail yard.
   Seven tankers are to be loaded onto flatbed cars later this week.
   ``It's wonderful to be back,'' said Jennifer Graner, who returned
to work today at a business near the second derailment site.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators said the city
of 230,000 narrowly averted disaster in the CSX Transportation Corp.
derailment and explosion next to a B.F. Goodrich Co. chemical plant.
   Chemicals stored outside the plant in large tanks and piped into
the building include highly flammable butadiene and styrene as well
as acrylonitrile, which can produce toxic fumes, said NTSB member
Jim Burnett Jr.
   ``That's one of the reasons for the high level of safety board
response to this situation, because the potential for a catastrophic
accident did exist here,'' he said.
   The safety board found ``some rough track conditions and
alignment difficulties'' on the tracks, which are owned and
maintained by Conrail and were last inspected by the railroad on
Feb. 23, Burnett said.
   The tracks next to the Goodrich plant had a speed limit of 40
mph, while tapes from the train place its speed at 43 or 44 mph,
Burnett said. He said the train crew reported it was going 39 mph
when the accident occurred.
   CSX spokesman Lloyd Lewis, asked if the train may have been going
at an unsafe speed, said, ``If the speed limit is 40 miles per hour,
which it was, and the speed tape says 43 or 44, you can conclude
that. It's like a highway.''
   Burnett said the engineer, conductor and two brakemen were tested
for alcohol or drug use. The tests were sent to a lab for analysis.
   He said investigators are also studying whether a hopper car that
carried sand may have played a role. It had 2{ inches of excess
lateral movement, which Burnett said ``is more than good maintenance
practice would deem ideal.''
   He added, ``We understand that this car was subject to some major
maintenance in October of last year and this was only the second
trip made with that car since then.''

   As any prosecutor can tell you,
there are rats and snakes in the public defender's office.
   A plan to exterminate the rodents, rabbits and reptiles that
burrow inside the trailer-office from a nearby field has backfired,
with the animals dying in the walls and floorboards and the lawyers
scurrying away.
   ``The place had become very malodorous,'' said Carl Holmes, chief
deputy public defender. ``It stunk.''
   Unable to work any longer, the lawyers, investigators and
secretaries sought temporary office space in the South Orange County
Municipal courthouse, a situation that created some problems with
attorney-client privacy.
   The county is paying $4,000 a day to hire outside attorneys to
handle misdemeanor cases because the public defenders have no place
private to speak with clients.
   Municipal Court Judge Pamela Iles said she doesn't blame the
public defenders.
   ``When we were pulling a dead rat a week out of the Public
Defender's Office it got to be too much,'' Ms. Iles said.
   County officials agreed the trailer is uninhabitable and said
they're working to find new office space as soon as possible.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new law passed by the District of Columbia
Council in an effort to fight the city's soaring crime rate would
impose a curfew of 11 p.m. on weekdays and midnight on weekends for
people under 18 years of age.
   The temporary measure passed Tuesday would allow police to detain
violators at police stations until a parent or guardian signs for
their release. Those not picked up would be held until 6 a.m. the
next day.
   The measure, introduced as emergency legislation by council
member Frank Smith, calls for fining parents and guardians of repeat
offenders $100 to $500.
   Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. has 10 days to sign the bill, which
would put it into effect immediately, or veto the measure. He has
taken no public position on it.
   City Corporation Counsel Frederick D. Cooke Jr. said his office
would study the legislation thoroughly before advising the mayor
whether or not to sign it.
   If approved, the curfew would expire after 90 days unless
permanent legislation is enacted.
   It would exempt young people engaged in ``specific business or
activity'' related to ``legitimate employment'' after the curfew
hours, but they would have to obtain an affadavit signed by a parent
or guardian and an employer.
   Some police officers said the curfew would be difficult to
enforce and would add to patrol officers' overburdened workload.

<TEXT>
   Venezuelans stood in long lines outside
the few open food stores today after two days of rioting that left
scores of people dead. The government told people to resign
themselves to a new way of life.
   The nation woke up under martial law, imposed late Tuesday by
President Carlos Andres Perez after the country's worst violence in
31 years of democratic rule.
   Perez also imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew, which government
spokesman Pastor Heydra said would last until peace had been
restored to the country.
   Citizens were prohibited from gathering in public places or
protesting publicly. Rights to privacy and freedom of the press were
suspended, and the military was given the right to detain anyone on
sight.
   ``I think Venezuelans should take this time to reflect on the
fact that Venezuela is a different country now, and we have to learn
different consumption habits and behavior habits,'' said Heydra.
   Reports from authorities and independent sources indicated the
death toll had surpassed 100 in violence touched off by protests
over price increases imposed to meet the demands of international
creditors.
   The El Nacional newspaper said today 80 people died in Caracas.
   At least 800 people were injured in what Perez termed an
``incredible tragedy.'' At least eight cities were placed under
military control.
   Authorities said thousands of people had been arrested.
   Perez, in office since Feb. 2, said in a television address
Tuesday night the riots were threatening the democratic process.
Even as he spoke, gunfire was heard in the streets, and rioting and
looting continued in this capital of 4 million.
   In the eastern shantytown of Petare, 17 people were killed in
battles between police and rioters. Victims were carried down from
the hills to be taken to hospitals while crowds watched, witnesses
said.
   Later Tuesday, the army moved into Petare and the hills of
January 23, a lower-income neighborhood on the west side of Caracas,
to take on snipers. Authorities said army units completed their
search before dawn but did not elaborate.
   Residents of the Palo Verde and La Urbina areas, both near
Petare, said they experienced ``hours of terror'' as pistol-armed
mobs came down the hills by the hundreds, sacked grocery stores and
a Portuguese restaurant, burning its furniture on the street before
the army intervened.
   ``I saw angry mobs shout at an army unit of approximately 200,
`We prefer to be killed by bullets than to die from starvation.'
Then shots started and I saw three fall dead. People covered the
corpses with blankets,'' said Jose Nunez del Prado, who lives in
Palo Verde.
   Nunez del Prado said that from his 12th floor apartment he saw 45
minutes of ``shooting between the submachine gun-armed unit and the
mobs, which shot pistols and rifles. It was a real war.''
   In nearby La Urbina, another mob tried to sack a McDonald's
restaurant. ``The army took action just in time because the place
was full of housewives and children,'' said resident Reinaldo Garcia
Cardenas.
   The capital looked like a ghost town, with only ambulances and
specially authorized vehicles operating. Army units stood at
downtown corners.
   The riots exploded Monday over increases in bus fares and
gasoline prices, announced in a recent economic package that
includes higher prices for food and basic items. Violence began in
Caracas and rapidly spread to other cities.
   The measures, announced two weeks ago, were required by the
International Monetary Fund before it would grant $1.5 billion in
badly needed credit. The country's foreign debt stands at $33
billion.
   Since 1958, Venezuela has been one of the most politically stable
countries in South America. In recent years, however, its oil-based
economy has been in a deep recession. Inflation is expected to
surpass 70 percent this year, up from 35 percent last year.
   Policemen in Caracas fired shotguns and tear gas for a second day
Tuesday to disperse crowds trying to gather in grocery stores.
   Metropolitan Police Inspector Omar Bolivar said ``rioters are
better-armed than we are. They have rifles, pistols, revolvers, even
submachine guns out there.'' A police commissioner was among those
shot to death Tuesday.
   One witness said looters carried 50 cow carcasses from a butcher
shop.
   Residents sacked and burned one of the city's largest shopping
centers in the wealthy suburb of San Bernardino.
   It was ``collective madness ... Some people brought cars and
station wagons to carry things away,'' a Radio Caracas Television
reporter said.

<HEAD>Singer Deletes ``Allah'' Song From Repertoire Following Threats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French singer Veronique Sanson has withdrawn a pop
song entitled ``Allah'' from her repertoire following bomb threats
to the concert hall where she is performing.
   ``We made this decision ... after having received sufficient
threats to make us not want to run useless risks,'' the singer's
spokesman, Jean-Pierre Domboy, said today.
   None of the callers to the theater identified themselves, Domboy
said.
   ``I received frightful threats,'' Ms. Sanson said in a radio
interview following her opening performance Tuesday night at Olympia
music hall.
   She said callers said they would place bombs in the concert hall
and threatened to kill her and the musicians.
   Authorities had no comment about the reported threats.
   The incident comes amid controversy over the novel ``The Satanic
Verses'' and Iranian threats to kill its author, Salman Rushdie.
Many Moslems say the novel is blasphemous.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe has said security precautions have
been taken since Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called
for Rushdie's death on Feb. 14. Joxe did not elaborate.
   Publisher Christian Bourgois, which will publish the French
version of Rushdie's book, is known to be under protection along
with three newspapers and weeklies that have published extracts.
   Ms. Sanson defended her song, a plaintive refrain about war and
misery.
   ```Allah' is absolutely not an insult, either for Islam or the
name of Allah,'' she said. ``It is, rather, a song of prayer and
love.''

<HEAD>Israeli Prime Minister Calls US Dialogue With PLO `Useless'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, in an
interview published today, called the U.S. dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization ``useless'' and said Chairman
Yasser Arafat and Adolf Hitler ``belong to the same family of
demagogues and totalitarians.''
   If Arafat flew to Israel as the late Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat did on a 1977 peace mission, ``we'd put him in prison,''
Shamir told The Washington Times.
   Interviewed in Jerusalem by Arnaud de Borchgrave, the Times'
editor-in-chief, the Israeli leader called King Hussein of Jordan,
with whom he has offered to negotiate terms for an Arab-Israeli
settlement, an ``element of stability'' in the Middle East.
   But, Shamir said, if a Palestinian state is to be established it
should be located on the East Bank of the Jordan River, where
Hussein's kingdom stands.
   ``If the Jordanian population one day decides to have a
Palestinian state there, it's up to them,'' he said.
   Although Jordan does not provide precise population figures it is
believed to be at least 70 percent Palestinian.
   The West Bank, meanwhile, which Jordan ruled from 1947 until the
territory was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, has nearly
1 million Palestinians and about 60,000 Jews.
   Shamir took a tough stand on these issues as the Bush
administration ponders its policy toward the Middle East. Israeli
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, who is also a hard-liner, is due here
for talks in two weeks with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Ending a 13-year ban, the United States opened a dialogue with
the PLO last December, over Israel's objections. There have been
five meetings so far in Tunisia, where the PLO maintains its
headquarters.
   Asked by the Times editor if the dialogue is a bad idea, Shamir
said: ``I think it's useless. Not healthy because it gives the PLO
more prestige and importance, and in such a way that it discourages
moderate elements who would like to find a path to real peace with
Israel.''
   Shamir said there were many moderate elements among the
Palestinians. ``But when they see the Americans talking to the PLO,
they cannot muster the courage to do anything else,'' he said.
   The U.S. talks with the PLO were based on a judgment by the
Reagan administration that Arafat had renounced terrorism, accepted
Israel's right to exist and subscribed to U.N. Security Council
resolutions upholding the right of all states in the area to live
within secure borders.
   But Shamir did not detect any change in Arafat's attitude.
   ``History is replete with such phenomena who, after a while,
disappear when they have outlived their usefulness,'' he said.
``Take Hitler. There was a time in the 1930s when Hitler was
celebrated the world over as some kind of savior. The end we know.
But the price was a very heavy one.''
   Asked if he were drawing a parallel between Hitler and Arafat,
the Israeli leader replied: ``They belong to the same family of
demagogues and totalitarians, enemies of the Jewish people, men who
think nothing of killing millions to achieve their objectives.''

   Mayor Robert Ulrich faces a runoff
against a former state legislator after finishing second in a
four-way election.
   Ulrich, 55, will face 50-year-old Dennis McDonald in the March 28
runoff, prompted when no candidate received more than 50 percent of
the vote Tuesday.
   McDonald received 15,101 votes to Ulrich's 13,849.
   McDonald and the two other candidates, Sherman Seaborn and Freddy
Lopez, led an unsucessful recall effort in 1987 against the
first-term mayor, a lawyer and bank board chairman who has staunchly
supported downtown redevelopment.
   During Ulrich's two years in office, the city completed
waterfront renovations and began building a major league baseball
stadium.
   Opponents complained that downtown has been improved at the
expense of neighborhoods and basic city services.
   McDonald, who served in the House in the 1970s, organized a
recall effort because of disgust over back-to-back tax increases.
His group tried to oust the entire City Council, but the effort
failed to collect enough signatures.

<HEAD>Personal Income Up 1.8 Percent In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal income shot up 1.8 percent
in January, the biggest increase in more than a year, while the pace
of consumer spending was nearly flat after a strong gain in
December, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said income rose $74 billion to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.28 trillion in January,
following a 0.9 percent increase in December and a 0.2 percent drop
in November.
   January's income gain was the biggest monthly increase since a 2
percent jump in October 1987.
   Personal consumption spending, meanwhile, edged up just 0.1
percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.35
trillion, following a 0.8 percent gain in December and a 0.4 percent
jump during November. The figures include virtually all consumer
spending except interest payments on debt.
   January's 0.1 percent increase was the weakest performance for
consumer spending since a 1.5 percent decrease last September.
   A slowdown in consumer spending would be welcome news because of
worries that demand has been outstripping the production
capabilities of factories coping with high operating rates and tight
labor markets.
   The increase in income was paced by a 1.2 percent gain in the key
component of wages and salaries, reflecting continued strong
employment.
   The recent income gains were bolstered by several special
factors, including a 4.1 percent pay raise in January for federal
civilian and military personnel, a 4 percent cost-of-living increase
in Social Security benefits in January, and a December increase in
farm subsidy payments, the Commerce Department said.
   But even excluding such special factors, personal income still
increased 1.6 percent in January and 0.8 percent in December.
   Americans' disposable, or after-tax, incomes rose 1.7 percent in
January, after rising 0.9 percent in December and falling 0.3
percent in November.
   With the income gain strongly outpacing the rise in spending, the
personal savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income,
rose to 5.8 percent from 4.3 percent in December.
   Spending was held back by a 3 percent decrease in spending on
durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last at least three
years. Purchases of services, which includes housing costs, were up
0.5 percent. Purchases of non-durable goods rose 0.9 percent.

<TEXT>
   Construction spending rose 0.4 percent in
January, led by a strong increase in work on non-residential
projects such as factories, offices and motels, the government said
today.
   Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$424 billion in January, following a 2.1 percent increase in
December and a 1.3 percent jump in November.
   January's 0.4 percent increase was the weakest performance since
a 0.3 percent rise last October. Rising interest rates have dampened
activity in most sectors, with fixed-rate mortgages averaging 10.78
percent last week compared with 9.87 percent a year earlier.
   In January, residential construction rose 1.1 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $204.6 billion, reflecting an unchanged pace of
building activity on single-family homes and a 3.7 percent gain in
apartment construction.
   Apartment construction generally has been sluggish in recent
months, held back by high vacancy rates and reduced tax incentives
for investment in such projects. The category had declined 0.9
percent in December.
   Non-residential construction, meanwhile, rose 4.3 percent in
January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $99.1 billion. Hotel
and motel building was up 8.7 percent and factory construction rose
7.3 percent.
   Activity in the industrial sector has been bolstered over the
past year as manufacturers expanded capacity to meet rising demand
generated by strong export sales, although the pace of exports
slowed during the last quarter of 1988.
   Construction of office buildings was up 2.2 percent during
January, while work on religious facilities rose 11.1 percent and
other commercial projects increased 5 percent.
   Government construction, meanwhile, declined 4.9 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $81.7 billion. The largest category for
government construction, highways and streets, was down 10 percent.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has commuted the
death sentences of 16 prisoners, including an activist who was the
subject of clemency appeals from the United Nations, the Justice
Ministry said today.
   The reprieves were hailed by human rights organizations as an
indication the government might be heeding widespread criticism of
the frequent use of capital punishment. There were 164 hangings in
South Africa in 1987 and 117 in 1988.
   The Justice Ministry gave no explanation for the action, merely
listing the 16 prisoners granted clemency. In each case, the death
sentence was commuted to a prison term, ranging from 10 years to
life.
   A ministry spokeswoman, Marie Pienaar, said the affected
prisoners included one mixed-race man and 15 blacks, among them Paul
Setlaba, who was convicted of committing murder during a 1985 black
consumer boycott.
   The ministry said the sentences were commuted by ``the state
president.'' But it was not immediately clear if that referred to
President P.W. Botha, who is recovering from a stroke, or his
replacement, acting President Chris Heunis. Setlaba's execution was
stayed by Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee in November, hours before
he was to be hanged.
   The stay followed appeals for clemency by human rights groups in
South Africa and by the U.N. Security Council, which depicted
Setlaba as an anti-apartheid activist caught up in political unrest.
   Details of the other reprieved prisoners' cases were not
disclosed.
   Brian Currin, director of South Africa's Lawyers for Human Rights
organization, commended the government for granting the reprieves.
He also said he was heartened that only two people had been executed
so far this year, compared to a monthly average of more than 10 in
recent years.
   ``These statistics, together with the 16 clemencies, give us hope
that the state is beginning to appreciate the need to review those
laws in South Africa that have resulted in the execution of so many
people,'' he said.
   Currin noted that Setlaba's last-minute stay was issued by
Coetsee after a Supreme Court judge had rejected an application for
a stay. The judge had asserted that there was no prospect of
clemency for Setlaba.
   The Black Sash civil rights group also commended the reprieves
but reiterated its call for a moratorium on all hangings while
experts consider the possible abolition of the death penalty.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ordered the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to reopen licensing hearings for a
nuclear power plant 25 miles from Philadelphia because the NRC
disregarded safety modifications.
   An opponent of the Limerick plant hailed Tuesday's ruling by the
3rd U.S. Court of Appeals.
   The court said the NRC's failure to consider safety design
alternatives could have affected the decision in 1985 to grant a
full-power operating license to Philadelphia Electric Co.
   Spokesmen for PECO and the NRC declined to comment on the effect
of the ruling.
   But Charles W. Elliott, an attorney for plant opponent Limerick
Ecology Action, said the ruling forces the NRC to reopen the
licensing procedure.
   ``It certainly sets a precedent. It says that the NRC can no
longer violate the National Environmental Policy Act by refusing to
consider safer reactor designs. There is now no excuse for PECO not
to implement design changes to reduce accident risk,'' Elliott said.
   The Limerick plant, which went on line at full power in 1985, is
one of three operating in the country within 50 miles of a major
metropolitan area.
   Limerick Ecology Action had challenged the plant's licensing in a
lawsuit in 1987. The challenge to the Limerick license was supported
by the state and the national Union of Concerned Scientists in
friend-of-the-court briefs.
   ``We feel it's a big victory,'' said Limerick Ecology Action
president David G. Stone. ``Not only will it help us, it helps other
cases around the country.''

   Leftist guerrillas today
attacked the main garrison of the easternmost province of La Union,
ignoring an army cease-fire and pleas to end the 9-year-old civil
war.
   Rebels late Tuesday also attacked a coffee processing plant that
local radio stations said belonged to the presidential candidate of
the rightist party favored to win elections scheduled this month.
   Insurgents of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said
they killed 67 soldiers and wounded 25 in the attack on the military
detachment in Santa Rosa de Lima, 110 miles east of San Salvador.
   The rebel report, broadcast on a clandestine radio station,
appeared to be greatly exaggerated.
   A military source, commenting on condition of anonymity, said
defenders of the detachment suffered ``some casualties'' but ``not
many.''
   The Armed Forces Press Committee, in a preliminary report, said
two guerrillas and one civilian were killed in the two-hour attack
on the garrison.
   The rebels also struck the Mecafe coffee processing plant outside
Nejapa, six miles north of San Salvador.
   A spokesman at the Nejapa Civil Defense post, contacted by
telephone, said the installation, which dries and bags coffee beans,
was completely destroyed by explosive charges detonated by the
rebels.
   About 20 soldiers stationed at the plant battled the attackers
briefly before retreating, said the spokesman, who commented on
condition of anonymity. He said no casualties were reported.
   Radio stations said the plant is the property of Alfredo
Cristiani, presidential candidate of Arena. The report could not be
immediately confirmed.
   Cristiani is favored to win the presidential election scheduled
for March 19. Arena has refused rebel demands to postpone the
elections.
   The military had said it would halt attacks at midnight and had
urged the guerrillas _ who are trying to negotiate participation in
national elections _ to also cease hostilities.
   The military announced the three-month halt in offensive
operations after the rebels offered to declare a unilateral
cease-fire of their own to help facilitate direct peace talks with
President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   However, the rebels rejected in their communique both the agenda
and venue for the talks that Duarte called for on Sunday.
   The armed forces said in a statement that the cease-fire took
hold at midnight Tuesday and would last until June 1, Duarte's last
day in office.
   It did not say whether the military would abide by the truce if
the guerrillas kept up their attacks.
   On Jan. 24, the rebels offered to take part in and respect the
results of the presidential vote if it was postponed several months.
They have boycotted the decade's five previous national elections.
   Duarte had called for a three-month cease-fire and for talks on
ending the civil war to begin Tuesday in Guatemala. He also said he
favored holding the presidential vote on April 30.
   The rebels rejected the site, saying talks should be Saturday and
Sunday in San Salvador. They also balked at an unilateral
cease-fire, insisting a lasting truce should be part of the
negotiations.
   An estimated 70,000 people have been killed and 500,000 to 1
million people displaced during the civil war.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government
has slashed defense spending and diverted funds to fight hunger,
illiteracy and provide homes for the homeless.
   The unprecedented reduction in defense spending was contained in
the government's budget for 1989-90, introduced in Parliament on
Tuesday by Finance Minister Shankarrao B. Chavan.
   Gandhi's government reacted to criticism that it is oriented
toward the rich by pledging to reduce official expenditures and
slapping new levies on cars, televisions, electronic goods, air
travel and hotel tariffs.
   Analysts said the budget was aimed at wooing the electorate, most
of them the rural poor.
   Gandhi came to power in 1984 after the assassination of his
mother and predecessor, Indira Gandhi. Under Indian law he is
required to call national elections by the end of the year.
   India will spend 2 billion rupees ($133 million) less on defense
in the 1989-90 fiscal year compared to the previous year's expenses,
Chavan said.
   India's armed forces, with the sixth largest army in the world,
has 1.3 million soldiers.
   The budget proposal calls for total spending of 821.6 billion
rupees ($54.7 billion) in the 1989-90 fiscal year, which runs from
April 1 through March 31. In 1988-89, the total budget was 735.6
billion rupees ($56.6 billion.)
   In February 1988, the exchange rate was an estimated 12 rupees to
$1. The current rate is 15 rupees to $1.
   Chavan pledged to spend 17 billion rupees ($1.1 billion) on
programs to fight hunger, illiteracy and provide housing for the
homeless. The amount is up by 5 billion rupees ($333 million) from
last year.
   The increased funds for such programs will be raised directly
from taxing the upper-middle classes, including an 8 percent
surcharge on annual incomes of more than 50,000 rupees or ($3,333).
   Government estimates for March 1988 indicate that 16.5 million
families, defined as a unit of five people, need housing in India,
meaning that 82.5 million people are considered homeless.
   Chavan said the nation was proud of the armed forces for bringing
``credit to our country when called upon to help other countries in
their hour of need.'' But he added: ``All of us recognize that there
is continuing need for implementing measures for greater cost
effectiveness.''
   India is spending 24 million rupees ($1.6 million) a day to
maintain 40,000 troops in neighboring Sri Lanka. They have been
stationed there since 1987 to enforce a peace accord aimed at ending
the 5-year-old Tamil separatist war.
   Besides maintaining its armed forces on the frontiers with China
and Pakistan, India is spending a huge amount to keep its control
over a Himalayan glacial ridge on the borders with Pakistan.
   The 50-mile-long Siachen glacier, the longest in the Himalayas,
is strategic because it overlooks China and Indian military
concentrations in the valleys nearby. There have been a series of
confrontations on the glacier since 1983. But the skirmishes
escalated into a major clash in September 1987, followed by several
more clashes.

   Democrat and Chronicle and Times-Union, Rochester, N.Y., on John
Tower:
   If, as some of his critics say, (John) Tower really is a
``problem drinker,'' ... then he can't be counted on to keep that
promise (not to take an alcoholic drink if confirmed as defense
secretary) _ however much he means to do so now.
   True, some people who drink too much just up and quit. But many
others need treatment. And the Senate can't assume that a guy with a
drinking problem will stop just because he says he will. ...
   It's too late for Tower to take back his promise. But the Senate
shouldn't be moved by it.
   What matters is the evidence. If it shows that Tower's drinking,
or his recent work for prominent defense contractors, would intefere
with his duties, he should not be confirmed.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on the Supreme Court private
violence ruling:
   The U.S. Supreme Court held the other day that states are not
obliged by the Constitution to protect children from abuse by their
parents. While that may be a technically correct ruling, many
citizens undoubtedly will feel that the decision somehow falls short.
   The case before the court involved a 4-year-old Wisconsin boy
whose father beat the child so severely that he suffered brain
damage that left him retarded and facing the rest of his life in an
institution.
   What's disturbing, aside from the father's inhumanity, is the
fact that state authorities knew that the child, Joshua DeShaney,
had been abused repeatedly before the final attack that put the boy
in a coma.
   The boy's mother, divorced from the father and living in another
state, sued Wisconsin on grounds of violating Joshua's
constitutional rights to life and liberty by not coming to his aid
when authorities knew he was being abused.
   While legally in the clear, Wisconsin authorities can hardly
escape bearing some moral responsibility for what happened to Joshua.

   Los Angeles Times on the Bush budget breakdown:
   President Bush sent his budget changes to Congress two weeks ago
with the flourishes appropriate to a kinder, gentler nation, but it
soon became apparent that his famed flexible freeze is more of the
same old formula of cutting domestic spending. ...
   The Congressional Budget Office is correct, however, when it
considers the ``base-line budget'' the amount of money, allowing for
inflation, that a program would have to get in the succeeding year
to provide the same service as in the previous year for as many
people as are eligible for the service.
   Bush has (claimed) that he has frozen defense spending and many
domestic programs in like fashion.
   But defense is getting an inflation adjustment of $10.2 billion
while the domestic programs are being held to the same dollar
amounts as in the current budget year. Thus his flexible freeze
really is a $9.6 billion cut from the base-line budget.

   Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune on acid rain:
   Americans can join Canadians in rejoicing over the announcement
by President George Bush during his recent visit to Ottawa that his
administration will seek an acid rain treaty, for it provides
recognition by the executive branch, after nearly a decade of
shilly-shallying, that the problem exists on both sides of the
border.
   It also denotes a postive step toward resolving a major foreign
policy issue disrupting northern-border relations. ...
   Bush's announcement, coupled with a budget address which included
a timetable for reducing emissions and proposed legislation to
strengthen the Clean Air Act, signaled a welcome change of attitude.

   Journal-World, Lawrence, Kan., on IRS Commisson Lawrence Gibbs:
   After 2{ years as head of the Internal Revenue Service, Lawrence
B. Gibbs is calling it quits.
   But it's not, he insists, because he's frustrated with his job.
In fact, Gibbs says, the IRS is getting better at processing tax
forms and providing customer service.
   But it's clear from his comments that there's still room for
improvement.
   Probably few federal bureaucrats have a more difficult job than
the person in charge of the IRS. It certainly appears that Gibbs'
successor has his work cut out for him.

   San Antonio Express-News on single-parent children:
   Bad news from the Census Bureau: The number of single-parent
households is up sharply since 1980, continuing a trend that goes
back three decades. More than 15 million U.S. children now live
apart from their mother or father.
   In 1960, only 7 percent of white children and 22 percent of black
were so labeled. In 1988, the figures were 19 percent and 54
percent, respectively. Thus an absolute majority of black children
are now being raised by a single parent.
   No government program can substitute for the economic and moral
benefits of growing up in a family with loving, authoritative role
models of both sexes.
   Until our culture finds a way to reverse the collapse of such
families, welfare dependency will continue to perpetuate itself.

   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on a U.S.-Mexico border ditch:
   The proposal to dig a ditch on the U.S.-Mexican border near San
Diego has swollen into an issue out of all proportion to its size or
importance.
   It should quickly be acknowledged for what it is: an
ill-conceived and poorly managed project. ...
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has so badly
bungled publicity that the original purpose of the four-mile-long
ditch is uncertain.
   Some say it is to improve drainage on a flat bit of mesa. ...
Others say the 8-foot-deep, 14-foot-wide ditch is intended to block
what is said to be the most popular route used by drug smugglers and
illegal aliens to drive across the border. ...
   There is a problem of drug trafficking and illegal entry across
our southern border. ...
   It is time for the U.S. to acknowledge that the long-term
solution to the border conflict lies not in more conflict but in
understanding and economic assistance _ in building fences, not
barriers.

   The Kansas City (Mo.) Times on Ralph Nader and thrifts:
   Ralph Nader, the consumer activist, is angered by the
administration's plan to restore stability in the thrift industry
because this plan is to be financed in part by the Treasury.
   Average taxpayers, Nader says, should not be made to bear any
part of the burden.
   Most of Nader's proposals read like something out of the
stagflation '70s, but one proposal _ for a .5 percent tax on stock
sales _ would be especially damaging.
   Taxing these transactions would be contrary to the interests of
every American who contributes and depends on a pension fund.

   The Evening Sun, Baltimore, on John Tower:
   John Tower ... promises he will quit drinking if he is confirmed
(as defense secretary). ...
   But under the present circumstances, taking the pledge begins to
resemble a man who, about to be thrown out of the house, desperately
promises his wife, ``I'll never take another drink!''
   But even if the no-drinking pledge is helpful, Sen. Sam Nunn
points out that a bad odor still hovers over Tower because of his
relations with defense contractors, whom he served at great profit
after leaving the Senate in 1984.
   Tower maintains his consulting business violated neither law nor
propriety. Dozens of other former lawmakers and bureaucrats, Tower
points out, have become consultants.
   But in the arcane world of national security, secrecy is the
critical edge of advantage. Even if he betrayed no secrets to
defense contractors, Tower unquestionably relied on his knowledge of
those secrets in giving the advice for which he was so handsomely
paid.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on John Tower:
   John Tower's pledge to swear off alcohol if he is approved as
secretary of defense is no justification for the Senate to confirm
his nomination.
   If he does still have a serious drinking problem, this pledge ...
is not enough. He would need rehabilitation. ...
   Even more troubling, however, are the potential conflicts of
interest involving Tower's dealings with defense contractors. He
left the Senate as an arms negotiator in 1984 to become a highly
paid consultant.
   Even though he reportedly did not violate any laws in his
consulting business, he profited handsomely from his willingness to
trade on his government position and his knowledge of government
secrets. ...
   John Tower has been a terrible nominee from the start. A more
thorough FBI investigation should have uncovered that.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee _ the body that would have to
work closest with Tower _ was absolutely right in rejecting his
nomination after its long and thoughtful hearings.
   Tower should step aside and President Bush should put the
interests of the Defense Department and the nation far ahead of his
loyalty to his longtime Texas friend.

   New Jersey Herald, Newton, N.J., on unnecessary Caesarean
operations:
   A study (by Public Citizen, a Washington consumer-advocacy group)
showing that approximately 500,000 Caesarean sections were performed
unnecessarily in U.S. hospitals during 1987 raised frightful
questions about the quality of medicine.
   The study ... reported that Caesarean operations ... climbed to a
new high for a 12th straight year.
   The ... group states that the use of Caesarean sections, rather
than normal labor, can increase the risk of death or illness for
mothers, substantially raise the cost of having a baby and exact a
``psychological toll'' on the mother.
   The C-section procedure of cutting through the abdomen and uterus
to deliver the baby averages more than $3,000 above the cost of
vaginal deliveries.
   If the medical profession cannot discipline its members against
unnecessary, dangerous and money-grabbing surgery, the undesirable
alternative for society may well be to invite government
surveillance and control of the profession.

   The Journal, New Ulm, Minn., on John Tower:
   Don't get the idea that John Tower was rejected as defense
secretary by the Senate Armed Services Committee just because he has
a reputation as a man who likes an occasional glass of wine and has
an appreciation for a well-turned ankle.
   Let's put it on a slightly higher level.
   Let's look at Tower's background in defense. As a senator, Tower
was chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and he was well-known
as a senator who ``never met a defense system he didn't like.'' (As
defense secretary), more likely he would be a rubber stamp for any
wish list the military gives him.
   After he left the Senate, Tower became a consultant to the
defense industry. In a couple of years he had received around a
million dollars in consulting fees from defense contractors. He and
defense contractors get along very, very well.
   This is the man who is supposed to go before Congress and make
credible, plausible arguments as to why we need this weapon or that
defense system, or why we should pay so much more money for this
project?
   The rumors of womanizing and drinking are the least of Tower's
problems. Let the Senate forget those rumors and judge the man
solely on his defense background.
   The vote against him should be overwhelming.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on sewage treatment:
   The new and higher Environmental Protection Agency cost estimate
for upgrading sewage treatment facilities prompted EPA Administrator
William K. Reilly to say, ``We must think cooperatively about how we
are going to solve waste water treatment problems.''
   He seemed to have in mind, with good reason, not only
collaboration in planning the execution of problems, but also
broader sharing of the enormous financial outlay required.
   In its report to Congress, the agency set this at $83.5 billion.
... The figure, incidentally, points up something we have cause to
be glum about: Congress approved the Clean Water Act in 1972, yet 17
years later the problems it addresses still plague the nation. ...
   With two-thirds of the nation's waste water treatment plants
deficient in some way, it is clear that we need to put more effort _
and that means more money _ into achieving what Congress intended 17
years ago.

   Bangor (Maine) Daily News on the Salman Rushdie affair:
   The ayatollah (Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran) is meddling directly in
the internal affairs of other states (with his execution order for
``The Satanic Verses'' author Salman Rusdie).
   He is using a new form of terrorism _ state-funded assassination
_ to intimidate into silence the resident of a country where freedom
of expression is cherished.
   He has created a new threat to world commerce. If one nation
dislikes a product or process allowed in another, Khomeini has
established his own corollary to caveat emptor: Paint a bull's-eye
on the head of the foreign manufacturer.
   What began as just another strange, almost comical episode in the
reign of Khomeini has evolved into a broad confrontation over
principles of personal and economic freedom.
   The U.S. and its European allies must maintain pressure on the
Iranian government to lift the death sentence on Rushdie, a British
citizen of Indian heritage who has been made an international symbol
of the value of freedom of expression. The Iranians must not be
allowed to make him a martyr.

   The Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on Hirohito's funeral:
   Few Americans would have blamed George Bush had he chosen to skip
Emperor Hirohito's funeral. ... The president had personal reasons
not to honor Hirohito's memory.
   Like millions of other Americans, he was drawn unwillingly into
World War II as a result of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. While
serving as a naval aviator, he was shot down by the Japanese over
the Pacific Ocean in 1944.
   Historians today dispute Hirohito's role in the Japanese
aggressions of that era. But there's no question the emperor at
least reluctantly endorsed Japan's decision to wage war against the
United States and other Pacific powers. ...
   By attending the funeral, Bush made it clear that what happened
in the Pacific nearly a half-century ago no longer has any bearing
on America's relationship with Japan. And that relationship _
despite all the grumblings about trade balances _ is one of
friendship. ...
   World War II is history. America's future is now inseparable from
Japan's. Nothing could demonstrate those realities better than
George Bush's presence in Tokyo.

   The General Assembly today approved $416
million for the U.N. peacekeeping mission to free Namibia from 74
years of South African rule.
   On April 1, the world body plans to begin implementing a one-year
plan to create the world's newest independent nation, in the process
settling the last major colonial problem in Africa.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I, when it
captured the former German colony. In December, Pretoria finally
agreed to cooperate with the U.N.'s one-year plan to make the
territory a sovereign state.
   The General Assembly was able to clear the last hurdle to
implementing the plan after its budget subcommittee, overriding
objections from several African nations, decided Tuesday night that
U.N. peacekeepers in Namibia may buy goods from South Africa as long
as it continues to be the cheapest supplier.
   Countries led by Zambia and Zimbabwe had delayed approval of the
assessment for the force by trying to make the United Nations heed
its own calls for trade embargoes on South African products.
   Britain, France and the United States opposed the restrictions on
purchases for the force, citing the higher cost of buying goods and
services elsewhere that are available from South Africa.
   Late Tuesday, the assembly's budget committee adopted language
that noted the embargoes but called on the United Nations to buy
from the lowest bidder among the ``widest possible sources of
procurement'' in the interest of ``economy and efficiency.''
   A dejected Zambian Ambassador Peter Dingiswayo Zuze said he
viewed the compromise as the ``best as can be.''
   U.N. fiscal controller Luis Maris Gomez pledged that the world
body would not buy helicopters from South Africa, as the black
African states had feared.
   He said peacekeeping troops would bring their own military
vehicles, but mine-resistant vehicles would be needed in the early
stage of the mission, and these would likely be leased from South
Africa.
   Other U.N. officials noted that South Africa is readily able to
supply the $10.2 million in gasoline and aviation fuel the Namibia
force will need.
   The black African states had proposed that fuel be bought from
Angola or the Congo _ a more expensive proposition.
   In December, the five permanent members of the Security Council
had clashed with the black African states over the size and cost of
the mission. The Africans wanted 7,500 peacekeepers sent, at a cost
of up to $700 million.
   The Security Council instead adopted the Big Five plan of sending
just 4,650 personnel, with the rest held in reserve.
   The Big Five _ the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France
and China _ pay 57 percent of all peacekeeping costs.
   The U.N. mission in Namibia is to oversee November parliamentary
elections in the territory also known as South-West Africa.
   South Africa agreed to grant Namibia independence as part of an
accords signed in December that also call for the withdrawal from
Angola of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops who have aided that
country's Marxist government in a 14-year-old war against South
African-supported rebels.

   An Everglades wildfire moved away from a major
interstate power line today after firefighters in a helicopter
dropped incendiary bombs the size of ping-pong balls to create a
buffer in the drought-parched region.
   Downpours that drenched parts of the southern Florida coast
Tuesday brought only a few light showers to the fire zone, but
optimism grew today with more rain in the forecast.
   ``We're probably in better shape than we have been all week,''
forestry division spokesman Jim Whitson said. ``It looks like we've
got some moisture coming into the state right now, and things have
cooled down considerably.''
   Fanned by steady 10 mph winds, the 3-day-old blaze burned an
estimated 12,000 acres before stalling at a drainage canal at the
Palm Beach County line northwest of Fort Lauderdale early this
morning, forestry officials said.
   Thick smoke from burning resins in sawgrass and melaleuca trees
forced the Florida Highway Patrol to close eight miles of highway
for about an hour Tuesday, and prompted complaints from as far as 30
miles away in Palm Beach, state forestry spokesman John Kern said.
   Firefighters dropped incendiary bombs from a helicopter to start
backfires designed to keep the 10-mile-long wall of flame away from
interstate power lines serving more than 3 million South Florida
residents.
   Florida Power &amp; Light Co. shut off power on the three
500,000-volt lines for four hours during Tuesday's operation. No
blackouts were reported. In 1985, a fire that burned more than
100,000 acres engulfed power lines and caused widespread blackouts
in southern Florida.
   Today, forestry officials on the western side of the Everglades
contained a 4,050-acre fire that burned through cypress and
palmetto-dotted scrubland, duty officer Debra Carter said. Officials
planned to use incendiary bombs on the blaze later today to burn
remaining fuel.
   That blaze was stalled just south of Alligator Alley, a two-lane
highway connecting Fort Lauderdale to the Gulf coast, said Fort
Myers forestry officer Roberta Smith.
   The two wildfires were the largest of more than 65 fires the
forestry division has fought since Monday with about 400
firefighters, said Charles Maynard, spokesman for the agency in
Tallahassee.
   Tuesday's rainfall caused flooding that closed the main runway at
Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport for two hours. The
rain also caused a rush-hour mudslide onto Interstate 95 that backed
traffic up for six miles.
   But little of it hit wilderness areas, where rainfall has
averaged less than half normal levels since last fall.
   The National Weather Service forecast scattered showers in some
parts of the state over the next few days, but nothing that would
alleviate the growing fire danger, Maynard said.

   South Carolina today banned hazardous waste
shipments from 32 states and Puerto Rico that have not begun
creating their own dumps.
   ``As trucks that come from an area that's banned ... we're going
to turn the truck back and, if at all possible, escort them back to
the state line,'' said Bill Culler of the state Department of Health
and Environmental Control.
   The ban applied to a commercial landfill operated here by GSX
Services. It is one of only two commercial hazardous waste landfills
in the Southeast.
   Most landfill customers had been notified of the ban, but the
department increased the number of inspectors monitoring the
landfill from three to 10 today to watch for unexpected loads from
banned states, Culler said.
   ``It will have a tremendous impact on our business,'' GSX Vice
President Roger Davis said. ``We just think it's a good business
decision not to challenge it.''
   The ban, announced Tuesday, affects such heavy landfill users as
Florida and North Carolina.
   It results from Gov. Carroll Campbell's Jan. 18 executive order
that South Carolina would prohibit, beginning March 1, the disposal
of waste from any state that refused to dispose of the waste itself.
   ``We hope our actions will encourage other states to move toward
developing their own hazardous waste management programs,'' said
Hartsill Truesdale, head of the state health department's hazardous
waste division.
   ``It was both the failure of other states to aggressively address
their waste disposal problems and the growing imbalance in waste
disposal that prompted Governor Campbell to issue this executive
order.''
   The massive GSX landfill on the shore of Lake Marion annually
accepts 135,000 tons of hazardous waste, such as solvents, acids and
other chemical garbage. About 70 percent comes from out of state.
   The other hazardous waste landfill in the Southeast is in Emelle,
Ala.
   The governor's spokesman, Tucker Eskew, said he believed
Campbell's message to other states would come across: ``If it's not
good enough for you, it's not good enough for us.''
   Campbell has said that any state would have to remove disposal
prohibitions before the ban could be lifted.
   North Carolina responded to the ban with the introduction of a
bill Tuesday that renews that state's search for a hazardous waste
treatment plant, though it fails to specify when a site would be
chosen.
   South Carolina state Sen. Phil Leventis, a longtime landfill
opponent, said other states should have working disposal sites
before being allowed to send South Carolina their waste.
   ``Anybody that promises us that with a little revision of a law
that their state is soon going to be handling its own hazardous
waste is simply telling us the check is in the mail,'' Leventis said.
   The banned states shipped about 45 percent of the waste handled
by the dump in 1987, according to the latest figures available.
   In addition to Puerto Rico, Florida and North Carolina, the
following states are affected by the ban: Alaska, Arizona,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington,
West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

<TEXT>WASHN:    Tower has been battling questions about his drinking habits,
allegations of womanizing and concerns about his acceptance of thousands
of dollars in defense consultants' fees.    The former Texas senator scheduled
an early-afternoon speech to the National Press Club to press his own case
for confirmation.    Speaking an hour before Tower's remarks, Mitchell
said he was troubled by Tower's work as a defense consultant. ``He received
payment while it was widely assumed that he might be a nominee for defense
secretary if President Bush were elected,'' the Democratic leader said.
   Turning to the controversy over Tower's personal conduct, Mitchell
said ``it is not moral perfection or the qualifications of senators that
are at issue here.''    ``Public officials have a right to a private life,''
he said. ``They do not have a right to engage publicly in behavior which

   Immigration agents today took into custody
27 more suspected illegal aliens on a flight bound for New York,
bringing to 175 the number seized in a three-day crackdown on alien
smuggling rings.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials in Atlanta,
whose jurisdiction includes Charlotte, said the 27 were on a
Piedmont Airlines flight from Phoenix.
   The 27, who are from Mexico, Brazil and El Salvador, were taken
off the plane during a stopover here at 6:40 a.m., the INS said.
They had flown to Phoenix on an America West Airlines flight from
Los Angeles late Tuesday, officials said.
   ``An irate citizen called our office (Tuesday) morning and
claimed to be a commuter aboard the Piedmont flight,'' said David
Carmichael, supervisory INS agent in Charlotte. ``The source
suggested we check Flight 1522.''
   Thomas Fischer, INS district director in Atlanta, said the aliens
caught today apparently paid $2,000 apiece for the trip, which he
described as part of a ``massive smuggling ring.''
   ``Los Angeles is literally saturated with aliens,'' said Neil
Jacobs, assistant INS director for investigations in Atlanta. ``The
word has spread that L.A. is not the place to obtain employment.''
   Fischer said this was the third time INS agents had apprehended
illegal aliens on the Piedmont flight. Fifteen people were caught in
Charlotte on Oct. 6, and 17 more Oct. 12, he said.
   On Monday, INS agents apprehended 79 suspected illegal aliens
aboard an Eastern Airlines that stops in Atlanta en route from Los
Angeles to New York.
   Sixty-nine more aliens were taken into custody in Los Angeles
Monday night as they attempted to board the same flight.
   The INS said a man believed to be a leader of a smuggling ring _
Jorge Guzman-Romero, a 42-year-old Mexican _ was arrested along with
the 69 in Los Angeles.
   Immigration officials stressed that several independent smugglers
may have been using Eastern's ``red eye'' Flight 80 to ferry illegal
aliens to the East Coast and that the group arrested in Los Angeles
was not necessarily linked to those seized in Atlanta.
   ``This was a concurrent, parallel investigation that will
continue until we close this route. We suspect there will be other
routes,'' Donald H. Looney, acting district director of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service in Los Angeles, said Tuesday.
   Authorities said the chief smuggling operators remain at large,
but they described Guzman-Romero as a leader.
   ``We're not as close as we'd like to be. We'd like to have (the
ringleaders) in handcuffs,'' said Thomas Gaines, INS assistant
district director for anti-smuggling.
   Guzman-Romero was charged with transporting at least three
illegal aliens. U.S. Magistrate Volney V. Brown declined to set bail
Tuesday, saying Guzman-Romero has no ties to the Los Angeles area.
   Gaines said investigators received tips that several groups used
Eastern's late-night flight to New York.
   ``We feel like we have a number of individual smugglers who are
utilizing a rather low airfare to move their aliens away from the
border from Los Angeles and on up to the East Coast,'' Gaines said
at a news conference.
   Smugglers often appear early at the ticket counter and pay cash
for a block of tickets, officials said.
   The 69 aliens caught in Los Angeles allegedly paid up to $4,000
for a package that probably included crossing the border, passage to
a drop house and the cross-country flight, Gaines said. He said he
didn't know if the package included finding employment.
   Fifty-four were from Mexico, seven from El Salvador and four each
from Colombia and Guatemala, Looney said.
   INS spokesman Joe Flanders said most of the people, if found to
be illegal aliens, would be given the choice of going home or
requesting a deportation hearing. He said some might be held as
material witnesses.
   Tom Thomas, a spokesman for the INS in Atlanta, said thousands of
illegal aliens may have been shuttled across the country on the
Eastern flight nearly every day for the past 30 days.
   Gaines refused to speculate on how many illegal aliens may have
used the flights but said the technique is not new, recalling at
least one sweep in recent years that netted 200 people.
   Both Thomas in Atlanta and Looney in Los Angeles said Eastern
Airlines was not a target of the investigation. Eastern cooperated
with the INS on the Atlanta arrests, officials said.

<HEAD>Hungary's Border Alarm System to be Removed By 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's electronic alarm system along
its border with Austria will be dismantled by January 1991, partly
because of too many false alarms, official reports said Wednesday.
   A report submitted to the Communist Party's Politburo said
guarding the borders poses a growing burden for guards ``thanks to
the fact that Hungary's ties with the world have expanded,'' the
government news agency reported.
   In an interview published in the government newspaper Magyar
Hirlap, the commander of the western Hungary border zone, said the
guards ``wholeheartedly support the initiative ... it is an outdated
system.''
   Col Istvan Franko quoted the guards as saying the technical
warning system posed ``a physical and mental stress for them.''
   Franko said that in the Sopron border region alone, 4,374 alarms
were registered last year, of which only 44 were actual border
violations.
   Ninety-three percent of the violations were committed by foreign
citizens, mainly East Germans heading for Austria.

<HEAD>Mass Trial of Alleged Leftist Terrorists Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trial began Wednesday for 253 people charged with
insurrection during the reign of leftist terror in Italy during the
1970s and early 1980s.
   Several defendants, including noted Red Brigade members such as
Barbara Balzerani, were convicted in the 1978 kidnapping and murder
of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro. Another noted defendant is
Renato Curcio, who headed the Red Brigade during the height of its
activity.
   If convicted on charges of insurrection and civil war, the
defendents face sentences of life imprisonment.
   About 40 defendants watched the opening proceedings from inside
steel-barred cages. Another 40 who are jailed refused to attend the
proceedings, exercising their right under Italian law to skip their
own trial.
   Many have renounced terrorism, but some vowed from their
courtroom cells to support ``the struggle of comrades in the Red
Army Faction'' _ the West German-based leftist terrorist movement.
   The Italian government says it has practically eradicated
left-wing terrorist activity. However, terrorists have carried out
spectacular crimes in recent years, including the 1988 slaying of an
Italian senator at his home.

   A U.S. Coast Guard technician who tried to sell $19
packets of the ``sand of Iwo Jima'' won't get into trouble because
no one responded to his advertisements, the military said.
   Electronics technician George Wills ran several classified ads
last month in the Pacific Stars and Stripes, a U.S. military
newspaper, offering a package that included the sand, a letter of
authenticity, a history of ``one of America's bloodiest battles'' in
World War II, and a color photograph of Mount Surabachi, where the
American flag was raised on invasion day.
   U.S. military officials, checking a possible ``misappropration of
property,'' found Wills innocent, said Maj. Anthony Rothfork,
spokesman for U.S. Forces Japan.
   ``He's had no responses to haced in the Stars and
Stripes and he will be taking out another ad saying that the sand,
photograph and letteris ad that he pl of authenticity are no longer available
for
sale,'' Rothfork said.
   Wills spent a year on the tiny Japanese island before being
transferred to Guam last year.
   He took with him a package of sand he scooped up on Invasion
Beach, Rothfork said, and when he advertised sales of such sand,
military officials in Guam investigated.
   ``At this point, the matter is closed,'' Rothfork said.
   The 3,500-yard beach is where 30,000 U.S. Marines came ashore on

   A court has acquitted two missionaries
from the United States and Canada on charges of proselytizing, and
they said after spending four months in prison awaiting trial that
they want to leave the Hindu kingdom as soon as possible.
   ``We've had enough of Nepal,'' David McBride of Columbia, Pa.,
told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``We are going to go home.''
   McBride and Mervyn Budd of London, Ontario, were acquitted
Tuesday on charges of preaching Christianity and causing a
disturbance to Hinduism.
   McBride, 33, and Budd, 26, arrived Wednesday in Katmandu from the
town of Phidim, 150 miles to the east, where they were arrested Oct.
27 at the end of a five-week trek of the Himalayan foothills.
   They were arrested on charges of proselytizing, punishable by up
to six years in prison.
   The constitution declares that Nepal is a Hindu state, and the
law bans conversion from Hinduism to another religion.
   McBride and Budd had pleaded innocent. The court ordered them
held because Nepalese law does not permit bail for foreigners who
face sentences of more than six months.
   Police had confiscated books on Christianity in the Nepali,
Limbu, Sherpa, Tibetan, English and German languages, as well as
cassette tapes they allegedly sold during their trek.
   Justice Ek Raj Acharya acquitted them because of lack of evidence.
   McBride's wife, Connie, embraced him after he arrived by plane in
Katmandu.
   ``For me ... it is a miracle that they are released,'' she said.
   ``I am happy to be out,'' McBride said. ``But there are a lot of
people that need to be out of that jail, too.''
   He said at least two-thirds of the 46 others in the prison were
innocent, ``at least that is what I think from my conversations with
them. They are not guilty but they have staying longer than me ...
Some of them can't afford lawyers. Some of them just stay there.''
   McBride and Budd were affiliated with the Operation Mobilization,
a London-based Christian organization.
   An official with the organization, Mike Wakely, said the two had
received 2,000 cards and letters from all over the world while in
jail. On Tuesday alone, he said, they received 243 letters.
   Their 90-day visas expired while they were in prison, but
officials were working to clear the paperwork so they could leave
Nepal.
   ``This will be just a formality. ... They would be free to go
(home),'' according to an official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Last month, three Hindus who converted to Christianity were
sentenced to one year in prison by a court in Bhadrapur, 190 miles
southeast of Katmandu, a Nepalese news agency reported.

   Authorities today searched for a paroled killer
suspected of shooting to death an undercover federal drug agent in
the officer's car.
   Everette Hatcher, 46, was shot three times _ in the eye, ear and
shoulder _ on a dead-end street in a remote area on Staten Island on
Tuesday night, police sources and the Drug Enforcement
Administration said.
   A backup surveillance team found the agent dead minutes after the
shooting, which neighbors reported hearing.
   The slaying was the first of a federal drug agent in the New York
area in more than a decade.
   The agent, assigned to the New York DEA office, had gone there to
meet Constible Farace, a 28-year-old New Yorker from whom he had
bought drugs before, said Robert Strang, a spokesman for the DEA's
New York office.
   The agent had not gone to buy drugs and was not carrying money or
drugs, Strang said.
   Strang said authorities believe Farace showed up at the meeting,
and he said the man is a suspect in the slaying. The DEA, the FBI
and police were searching for him. ``We believe he's on Staten
Island,'' Strang said.
   Farace, whose street name is Gus, had been released from prison
in Elmira in 1988 after serving nine years for manslaughter, said
police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. He was on parole
until 2002, the sources said.
   Asked whether the agent's cover might have been blown, Strang
answered: ``At this point we're not speculating anything. Anything
is possible.''
   ``His window was down, his foot was on the brake and it appeared
as if he had rolled down the window to talk to somebody,'' he said.
   ``We've had agents killed around the country, but this one here
is the first time we've had an agent killed here in over 10 years,''
Strang said.

<TEXT>
   The use of Soviet citizens to spy on one another
does not conflict with the principles of glasnost, according to a
KGB official.
   ``The organs of the KGB have always regarded and still regard the
organization of work with citizens' written and verbal information
as one of the forms of their participation in ensuring state
security,'' said A.P. Burakov, the KGB chief in Mariyskaya, 450
miles east of Moscow. He made his comments in Wednesday's editions
of the newspaper Izvestia in reply to a reader's query in another
newspaper.
   The reader asked the other newspaper, Mariyskaya Pravda, how the
use of KGB informants in virtually every work collective fitted into
the era of glasnost _ President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
greater openness in Soviet society.
   ``In accordance with the constitution of the U.S.S.R., every
citizen is obliged to render the necessary assistance and
cooperation in ensuring state security,'' Burakov said. ``An
overwhelming majority of the people to whom we have to appeal for
such help is willing to render it to us.''
   In a rare and candid glimpse into the workings of the secret
police force, Burakov also said the KGB had a network of what he
called ``free-lance employees.''
   However, he said, their number was few and that their activities
were confined to large enterprises that were carefully regulated.
   He did not elaborate on what the ``free-lance'' employees did,
but said regular agents of the KGB ``are acting openly and they are
known by many people.''

   Police seized about 9,000 sticks of
dynamite and other explosives in a jeep that stopped near the U.S.
Embassy early Wednesday, police said.
   Officers were questioning four men who said they were hired to
transport the explosives to the northern province of Ilocos Sur,
according to police Capt. Rodolfo Ribal.
   Ribal said the men told him they did not know what the explosives
were for. He said the shipment was seized when a ``suspicious
looking'' jeep drove by two police patrol cars parked outside the
U.S. Embassy.
   Ribal said the explosives were buried under other goods loaded in
the jeep. ``It's possible the explosives were intended for illegal
fishing or something else, but it's possible they intended to use it
(for terrorism) here,'' Ribal said in an interview.

<TEXT>
   A high-level advisory group once seen as the
best hope for crafting a bipartisan solution to the nation's budget
problems ended up deadlocked, issuing a final report today that
splits essentially along party lines.
   The seven Republicans on the National Economic Commission and the
one Democrat appointed by President Bush endorsed the president's
pledge against raising taxes and praised his budget submission to
Congress, calling it a ``workable plan for eliminating the deficit''
by 1993.
   However, the six Democrats on the panel who were appointed by the
congressional leadership signed a minority report calling Bush's
budget ``neither theoretically sound nor politically realistic.''
   The administration's $1.16 trillion spending plan for 1990
``rules out any discussion of additional revenues and relies heavily
on harsh and disproportionate reductions in domestic spending,'' the
Democrats said.
   The sharply divergent reports ended up echoing the current debate
between Bush and congressional Democrats, where both sides remain
far apart on solutions to a budget crisis which is expected to
produce a deficit of $170 billion this year.
   Asked if the administration was disappointed that the panel had
failed its mission to come up with a bipartisan formula for reducing
the budget deficit, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said:
   ``They did an excellent job in trying to carry out their mandate.
It was a very difficult debate and discussion that they held.''
   ``Some of the things in that report are very useful, and we'll
have to analyze it for a more detailed respnse,'' he added. ``They
did the best they could,'' Fitzwater said.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., called
the commission's report ``disappointing,'' but said it was not
surprising.
   ``With little support or leadership from the president or the
Congress, the commission was unable to face up to the difficult
issues,'' he said in a written statement. ``It had no choice but to
punt.''
   The commission, which now goes out of existence, was a deep
disappointment to supporters, who pushed legislation creating the
panel through Congress in the wake of the October 1987 stock market
crash.
   Their hopes were that a panel of the nation's top business, labor
and political leaders would be able to agree on a combination of
spending cuts and tax increases to solve a deficit problem which has
almost tripled the national debt over the past eight years.
   But while campaigning for the White House, Bush was openly
critical of the commission, which had the backing of his Republican
primary opponent, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. Bush vowed to reject any
final report which called for a tax increase.
   The commission's Democratic co-chairman, Robert Strauss, said he
had ``hoped for a great deal more,'' but that the commission's fate
was sealed by Bush's campaign against tax increases.
   Strauss and Republican co-chairman Drew Lewis had hoped at one
time to adopt an ambitious package that would cut $50 billion to $60
billion from the deficit, in part by raising taxes.
   But Strauss drew criticism from within his own party last fall
when he suggested cuts in government benefit programs, including
Social Security, would be needed to balance the government's books.
   Not everyone was disappointed in the outcome of the panel's work.
   Dean Kleckner, a Republican member of the commission who was an
outspoken opponent of tax increases, said the majority report
reflected the ``will of taxpayers throughout the nation.''
   ``Testimony to the commission from 85 witnesses and more than
1,300 responses from private citizens and groups this past 11 months
clearly indicated opposition to higher taxes and irresponsible
spending,'' Kleckner said.
   Sen. Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., another commission member, said he
was pleased that both the Republican and Democratic reports
criticized continued use of Social Security payroll taxes to mask
the extent of the budget deficit.
   Both reports called for a goal of not simply eliminating the
deficit but achieving surpluses to build up the funds necessary to
cover the retirement of the ``Baby Boom'' generation.
   Both reports endorsed the need to reform the congressional budget
process with the Republicans offering a detailed list of
suggestions, many of them long championed by Ronald Reagan and now
Bush.
   They include a constitutional balanced-budget amendment,
presidential line-item veto authority in spending bills, a
streamlined congressional process for making budget decisions and
two-year rather than annual budgets.
   Commission member Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., a former House
Budget Committee chairman, blamed partisanship by Republicans for
the group's failure to succeed.
   ``The president didn't want a bipartisan deficit reduction plan.
He wanted his own plan, the flexible freeze, and he insisted on it
from Republican members,'' Gray said in an interview. ``Instead of
something bold that could have moved us forward, we end up leaving
it to Congress and the administration to continue the fight.''
   While Bush criticized the commission during the campaign, he did
appoint the final two members in December, former Sen. Paul Laxalt,
R-Nev., and longtime friend Thomas ``Lud'' Ashley, a former
Democratic congressman from Ohio.
   After taking office, Bush decided against extending the panel's
March 1 reporting deadline for another six months, a step many on
the panel had urged as a way of keeping the commission alive in the
hopes that it eventually could reach a consensus.
   That decision basically sealed the panel's fate and with only a
few weeks remaining, the panel abandoned efforts for any compromise
and began drafting majority and minority reports.
   In addition to Strauss, Moynihan and Gray, the other Democrats on
the panel were Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca; AFL-CIO
president Lane Kirkland and Felix Rohatyn, a New York investment
banker.
   In addition to Kleckner and Lewis, who is chairman of Union
Pacific, the other Republicans on the panel were Sen. Pete Domenici
of New Mexico; Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota; Caspar Weinberger,
former defense secretary in the Reagan administration; and Donald
Rumsfeld, former defense secretary in the Ford administration.

   Michele Knight slopped a jumbo can of cream of
mushroom soup into a pot and stirred _ a sight you'd never see at
her Verdi restaurant, where a meal can cost an easy $40 and strains
of Puccini accompany the pasta.
   Robert Miller, a recovering alcoholic and drug abuser, biceps
bulging from his T-shirt, looked on along with Nancy Silverton, a
former pastry chef at star-studded Spago and Michael's in Los
Angeles and Maxwell's Plum in New York.
   Ms. Silverton resumed her demonstration of how to section an
orange.
   ``They taste so much less bitter if you cut them away from the
membranes,'' said Ms. Silverton, author of ``Desserts'' and about to
open her own restaurant.
   ``Sage! Black pepper!'' said Tevis Runyan, the executive chef at
Duc Duc Mousse Catering. ``We sure won't need any salt.''
   The slightly surrealistic scene played out last week at the Union
Rescue Mission, where some of the city's top chefs showed
soup-kitchen cooks like Miller how to ladle out tastier and
healthier fare to the 2,400 homeless people who crowd in daily for
free meals.
   Miller, a former Army and short-order cook who is halfway through
an eight-month drug and alcohol recovery program, watched Ruth
Hedges slam a head of lettuce down, pop out the core, slice away
brownish leaves and hold the remainder up for inspection.
   ``If you went to today's expensive restaurants, you'd only get
the inside third of that _ just the heart,'' she said.
   No one's proposing serving haute cuisine on Skid Row, said Ms.
Hedges, who runs a company that provides food to tony private
schools and theaters and whose Women's Culinary Alliance organized
the monthly teaching sessions.
   It's more a matter of souping up whatever is on hand _ like
turkey tetrazzini for 900, which incorporated two cases of cream of
mushroom soup, 100 pounds of pasta and a couple of cases of frozen
peas.
   At the classes, held during regular meal preparation hours in the
mission kitchen, the master chefs and the mission cooks face off
across a table to prepare food together. It is then served to the
transients who stream in off Main Street and hunker at the rough
wooden tables.
   Most of the lessons are simple: Don't over-saute, season food
before popping it in the oven, don't cook the taste and vitamins
out, said Ms. Runyan, the caterer.
   At the first session last month, for example, chefs from the
vogue City Restaurant and Angeli explained how to use up leftovers
by making vegetable frittatas _ Italian-style omelettes.
   ``You can use up all your old produce _ just throw it in the egg
mixture and bake it. Plus it's simple to do,'' Ms. Runyan said.
   ``The really important thing is that it is going to be
nutritionally balanced,'' said Ms. Hedges. ``Those people out there
have a lot greater nutritional needs than you or me. ... The meal
they get here may be their only one of the day.''
   Members of the Women's Culinary Alliance, a ``networking''
food-industry group, at first merely gathered leftovers to donate to
the mission, said Ms. Hedges.
   ``But then I came down here one day and I saw the kitchen, and I
realized that this was where we could really focus _ on education,''
she said.
   It looks as though the mission will get a whole new kitchen for
free, along with the cooking tips.
   Shel Brucker, president of Avery Services Corp., which designs
and supplies restaurants, unveiled the plans, and said he was
confident his suppliers would contribute materials so the
restoration could be complete by year's end.
   Miller, the former Army cook, said he welcomed the chefs' advice.
   ``It's more than just thrown together now,'' he said. ``There's
more of a menu, and the food is seasoned properly.''

<HEAD>Owen Says North Told Him He Had Authorization From Superiors</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: INSERTS 2 grafs of detail on Owen's questioning after 5th graf,

   Oliver North's courier to the Contras, Robert
Owen, testified today that North repeatedly told him he had
authorization from his superiors for all his activities on behalf of
the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Under cross-examination, Owen also said he met with at least half
a dozen CIA agents in Central American countries to discuss supply
efforts to the Contras at a time when Congress had banned military
aid to the guerrillas. The agents were referred to in the courtroom
by number.
   Owen detailed the political sensitivity of handling the supply
operation which involved shipping goods through Honduras and Costa
Rica before they got into the Contras' hands.
   In connection with efforts to build a clandestine airstrip in
Costa Rica, Owen said that Costa Rican officials ``wanted to be
helpful'' while trying ``to maintain a veneer of neutrality.''
   Owen agreed with North lawyer Brendan Sullivan during questioning
that North had said numerous times that in assisting the Contras he
was carrying out the instructions of ``his superiors,'' including
the president.
   After a brief recess, however, Owen was questioend closely by
prosecutors about whether North specifically mentioned any of the
superiors he was talking about. Owen replied that North never said
anything indicating that he was acting with the knowledge of
President Reagan or that the president told him to lie or that the
president told him to conceal what he was doing. Owen also said that
North did not specifically mention the names of former National
Security Advisers Robert McFarlane or John Poindexter.
   ``He always used the word `superior','' Owen said.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell asked for dates but Owen
was unable to provide them.
   Meanwhile, the government filed a memorandum in the latest
dispute over classified information in the case.
   Sullivan has renewed a motion to declare that a federal law
designed to protect state secrets from being spilled in the
courtroom is unconstitutional as applied to the North case.
   The process of handling classified material in court ``is not, as
North contends, a reason to conclude that the trial is unworkable,''
said the filing by John Keker, head of the prosecution team.
   North's lawyers said they first found out Monday night that memos
from Owen to North which the government claimed were classified had
already been made public.
   At a hearing Tuesday, Gesell said he will reconsider how he will
handle classified material at North's trial.
   ``For 2{ weeks, a jury has been ready to try this case and hasn't
been able to try it,'' said Gesell. ``Now I hear we are dealing with
classified documents that can be classified ex post facto,'' or
after the fact.
   The memos written by Robert Owen, a onetime courier for North,
were censored before the trial by U.S. intelligence agencies, which
claimed that release could endanger national security. However, the
same memos had already been turned over to a private group in a
separate legal case eight months before.
   Owen's lawyer, Thomas Hylden, turned over copies of the memos
last June to the Christic Institute as part of a lawsuit the
activist group filed alleging a criminal conspiracy to supply the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels. In the memos, Owen spelled out for his
boss a wealth of detail about the private Contra supply network
overseen by North.
   North is accused of lying to Congress and the attorney general
about secret Reagan administration efforts to aid the Contras when
Congress had banned U.S. aid to the rebels.
   The trial was halted Monday when North's lawyers wanted to use
the name of a Costa Rican official, former security minister
Benjamin Piza, from one of Owen's memos in cross-examining Owen.
Piza's name had been censored by U.S. intelligence agencies.
   Owen's lawyer, Thomas Hylden, had informed independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh's office on Feb. 10 that the Christic Institute
already had the memos. But North's lawyers said they didn't find out
about it until Monday night when they were notified by Hylden.
   Prosecutors working for Walsh said inaction by the office
security director and inattention on their part, rather than any
intent to hide information, was the reason North's lawyers hadn't
been notified.
   The defense alleged prosecutorial misconduct, but Gesell said he
was ``not trying to look for sanctions'' against anyone. However,
the judge said he was concerned about ``getting to the bottom of
what's going on'' regarding the use of classified information at the
trial.
   ``My concern is whether this presents an example of looseness in
governmental dealings with this problem of classified information,''
he said.
   The judge questioned whether all his pretrial work on rules for
handling such information would have to be done over.
   Gesell noted that he had a continuing motion from North's lawyers
asking whether a fair trial is possible under rules set by a law
governing disclosure of state secrets at trial.
   Gesell said ``the question of a mistrial is out of the
question,'' a reference to the difficulty in getting a jury that was
ignorant of North's testimony at the televised Iran-Contra hearings
in 1987.
   ``This case can never be tried again,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Vietnamese farmer Dien Tan Sang plans to return
to his impoverished homeland Thursday because his dreams of a new
life abroad quickly evaporated inside Hong Kong's cramped detention
camps.
   Dien, his wife and three children have languished in the camps
ever since they fled communist Vietnam and sailed north to this
British colony on the China coast seven months ago.
   With dim prospects for resettlement and a gnawing concern for his
parents back home, Dien has decided his family will join 68 other
volunteers and fly to Vietnam in the first large-scale repatriation
of boat people from Hong Kong.
   ``I'm not clear if they (Hanoi officials) will punish us or
not,'' Dien, 30, said at the spartan Argyle Street Holding Center.
``I'm not afraid.''
   U.N. officials have promised to closely monitor Hanoi's treatment
of the returning boat people, and Fazlul Karim, head of the U.N.
agency overseeing the repatriation, said: ``Even at the Hanoi
airport if they do not want to get down from the aircraft, they will
not be dragged down.''
   The fate of Dien is of more than passing interest to Hong Kong,
which is straining under the weight of more than 25,000 boat people.
If he is treated well, officials say, more Vietnamese may go back.
   If the repatriation is successful and ``word gets back ... we
hope this will lead to further requests by people in camps in Hong
Kong to return to Vietnam,'' Secretary of Security Geoffrey Barnes
said at a news conference.
   Hong Kong long has classified all boat people as refugees
eligible for resettlement, and between 1979 and 1988 only 22 of more
than 100,000 arrivals voluntarily returned home.
   But to stem the growing tide of Vietnamese arrivals, Hong Kong
adopted a new policy under which most boat people arriving after
June 15 are considered illegal immigrants subject to forcible
repatriation. Only a small fraction that can prove they fled
persecution are eligible for resettlement.
   More than 10,000 boat people have arrived since the change and
some have registered their displeasure with the new policy by
staging hunger strikes and refusing to be interviewed by Hong Kong
officials.
   A few have even asked for new boats to head for friendlier ports,
although the government is unlikely to honor the request.
   Other new arrivals appear convinced their future lies back home,
and about 300 names have been submitted to Hanoi, although some have
since backed out.
   After the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and Vietnam
signed an agreement in December to set up a program of voluntary
repatriation, a four-member Hanoi delegation came to Hong Kong in
February to issue travel documents for the first 81 boat people to
go home. That number later dropped to 73 after some people backed
out at the last minute.
   The group is to fly home on a jet chartered from Hong Kong-based
Dragon Air and be accompanied by at least one U.N. official. Each
repatriated Vietnamese will receive a kit of basic supplies such as
clothing and household utensils, said Karim, the head of the U.N.
commission in Hong Kong.
   ``Vietnam has said quite clearly ... there would be no
prosecution or any punitive or discriminatory measures,'' Karim said.
   U.N. officials will be allowed ``full access'' to monitor the
repatriated boat people, he said.
   Despite the assurances, only a tiny minority of boat people have
offered to go home, and it is unclear how many more may follow.
   In fact, the flow of boat people leaving Vietnam may again be on
the rise. During the first 23 days of February, 328 Vietnamese
sailed into the territory, compared with 114 for all of January and
91 in February 1988.
   ``It certainly points to the fact that (the new policy) in and of
itself ... is obviously not a deterrent,'' said one Western
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A key deterrent in the new policy is forcible repatriation of
boat people classified as illegal immigrants, but Vietnam only
accepts voluntary returnees.
   Akber Khan, a Hong Kong government spokesman, said before
repatriation of boat people classified as illegal immigrants can
begin, Hanoi must agree to accept them, offer assurances of safety
and allow international monitoring of the program.
   An international meeting to discuss repatriation of boat people
will be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, next month, and Hanoi is
expected to attend.
   Meanwhile, resettlement of the approximately 15,000 Vietnamese in
Hong Kong camps granted refugee status received a recent boost with
several countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada
and Great Britain, agreeing to increase the number they accept.
   Officials believe 4,000 refugees may be resettled this year, up
from 2,772 last year and 2,212 in 1987.

   A trade group official says tourism in the
nation's capital grew by a ``comfortable rate'' last year despite a
drug-related crime wave in the city.
   ``Fortunately, we haven't found it affecting us,'' said Marie
Tibor, director of tourism for the Convention and Visitors
Association, a trade group that encourages tourists to visit the
city. ``We've had a nice comfortable rate of growth.''
   About 19.6 million visitors came to the Washington area last
year, up 3 percent from the previous year, according to the
association's annual report scheduled for release next month.
``We've done better than some of the previous doom-and-gloom
forecasts,'' she said Tuesday.
   The district had a record 372 homicides last year, and police
said 60 percent of them were related to drugs. A total of 91 people
were slain in January and February of this year, compared with 54 in
the same period last year.

<TEXT>
   An Afghan guerrilla group said
Wednesday that insurgents captured about 250 government troops, two
helicopters and other Afghan communist weapons.
   The Afghan News Agency, an organ of the Hezb-i-Islami guerrillas,
said guerrillas also shot down a military transport plane and a
MiG-27 jet fighter with a U.S. Stinger missile.
   There was no independent confirmation of the reports.
   The guerrillas said they captured 168 soldiers of the Afghan
army's 20th Division in fighting Saturday along the strategic Salang
Highway. They said about 80 others were captured in other areas of
Afghanistan, but did not specify when or where.
   Guerrillas reportedly have blocked portions of the 240-mile
Salang Highway, which is a key supply route from the Soviet border
to the Afghan capital of Kabul.
   Two pilots defected with two Mi-35 helicopter gunships on Tuesday
in central Kapisa province, northeast of the capital, the agency
said.
   The agency said guerrillas also shot down two planes _ a
transport plane near the southeastern city of Kandahar and a MiG
fighter in the western province of Farah.
   A rival rebel group said Sunday that three communist regiments,
or about 10,000 troops, have surrendered to the resistance in
northern Afghanistan since Soviet troops completed their military
pullout on Feb. 15.
   The Soviets had intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979, one
year after a communist coup prompted the Moslem guerrilla revolt.
   About 250,000 government security forces hold key Afghan cities
but are encircled by the U.S.-backed guerrillas, who control most of
the countryside.
   Guerrilla leaders predict that communist troops soon will defect
in numbers large enough to cause the Kabul government to fall.
   In another development, a French nurse with the humanitarian aid
group Medecins Du Monde died in an avalanche southwest of Kabul, an
organization official said Wednesday.
   The Medecins Du Monde spokesman, who asked not to be identified,
said Kristof Cany, a male nurse, and an 18-year-old Afghan assistant
died Sunday in Afghanistan's central Wardak province.
   The two were walking between the Medecins Du Monde clinic and
living quarters when the snow roared down the mountain, the
spokesman said.
   Four French nationals worked at the clinic, which has been
treating war wounded for more than two years.
   Cany, 26, went to Afghanistan in October and was scheduled to
return to France this month. He was from Carmaux, France.
   The French spokesman said Cany's death is the first since
Medecins Du Monde began operating in Afghanistan in 1981.

   William J. Bennett Jr., President Bush's choice
to run the nation's war on drugs, said today that despite
pessimistic talk about his chances for success, he believes he can
help ``bring some change for the better soon.''
   At his confirmation hearing as director of national drug control
policy, Bennett told the Senate Judiciary Committee: ``I've been
struck ... these last few weeks, as I've met with people inside
government and out, by the pessimism, even fatalism, people have
about our mission in the war on drugs.
   ``Some have told me they wouldn't wish this job on their worst
enemy; others have made clear they think the war is already lost,''
he said. ``I think we must disagree. There are things that can be
done.''
   Bennett said he shared the concern of committee Chairman Joseph
R. Biden Jr., D-Del., about promising too much too soon.
   ``But at the same time, I remain convinced that concerted,
intelligent effort and strategy, if implemented, can bring change
for the better _ and bring some change for the better soon,'' said
Bennett, who was education secretary during the Reagan
administration.
   Biden extended some bipartisan support to Bennett, saying he
would run ``political interference'' for him if necessary.
   Biden told Bennett at the opening of his confirmation hearing
that ``as long as you make a good-faith effort to comply with this
statute (creating the post), you will have my personal and political
support ....''
   ``I personally will run all the political interference that you
need,'' said Biden, who worked for eight years to create the drug
czar position.
   Although the overwhelming tenor of the opening statements by
committee members was supportive of Bennett, Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., said he was ``somewhat troubled'' by the nomination and
might not vote for him.
   ``If we were to elect a national gadfly in this area, you would
have my vote,'' Simon said.
   The senator said that when Bennett was education secretary and
complained about the drug problem, he told other Cabinet secretaries
_ the secretaries of state and defense and the attorney general,
among others _ what they should be doing to fight the drug battle.
   ``In your own department, where you had a chance to do something,
you asked for a cut in one-half of the money for the drug problem,''
Simon said.
   ``If I vote no, and I think I may be the only one, I hope you do
a job that will make my vote wrong,'' Simon said.
   Bennett was introduced and endorsed by four senators and a House
member: Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Alfonse M. D'Amato,
R-N.Y.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; and Terry Sanford, D-N.C.; and Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control.
   Biden reiterated today his criticism of Bush for not giving
Bennett Cabinet status.
   ``At one time or another, you will have to go to the mat with
everyone of your Cabinet colleagues and you need to meet them on
equal terms in the decisive forum, the Cabinet Room,'' he said.
Biden described the job before Bennett as ``a Herculean task,'' and
said Bennett was ``bound to fail'' in some of his efforts.
   However, Biden said he would only criticize Bennett if he failed
to come up with a strategy to deal with the drug problem and did not
take full advantage of the powers his position holds.
   He said the position ``may be our last best chance to take hold
of an epidemic wave'' of drug abuse.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on
the Judiciary Committee, praised Bennett and said his initial doubts
about the wisdom of appointing one person to coordinate all federal
anti-drug activities had been relieved.
   In advance of the hearing, Biden said in a television interview
today that Bennett's pugnacious reputation as education secretary in
the Reagan administration will serve him well in his new job.
   Bennett is ``going to have to be combative, he's going to have to
be tough, he's going to have to be a real scrapper,'' Biden said on
ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``The very things that made Bill Bennett controversial as
secretary of education are things that may make him particularly
useful as the so-called drug czar,'' Biden said. ``He was never
afraid of controversy, he was never afraid of being critical.
   ``This first drug director is going to have to be willing to take
on other Cabinet members ... and going to have to be willing to be
controversial,'' the committee chairman said.
   According to the bill passed last year creating the post, the
director must compile in his first 180 days a comprehensive drug
control strategy encompassing all aspects of the battle against
illegal drugs, from law enforcement here and abroad to treatment
programs for addicts.
   It may be that he's already leaped the toughest personal hurdle,
as he quit his two-pack-a-day cigarette smoking habit, Tell said.
   Although Biden said he doesn't care about the smoking, Bennett
made a commitment Jan. 12, the day President Bush nominated him to
become drug director, to stop smoking by the time he took office.
   He kicked the habit by attending a stop-smoking clinic, called
``Breathe Free,'' when he, his wife Elayne and son John went to the
Coolfont resort in Berkeley Springs, W.Va., last week, Tell said.
   ``I went in his office and there's no ashtray,'' said Tell, but
there are some crutches _ a bowl of fruit and lollipops.

<TEXT>
   Baltimore's school district has bowed out of a
national program to overhaul the way ycnence is taught because the
superintendent says he doesn't want his teachers to lose classroom
time working on the"soject.
   Superintendent Richard C. Hunter said the district will not
participate in the four-year, $10 million project, an unprecedented
nationwide effort to help American students catch up with their
peers in other countries.
   Project 2061, sponsored by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science and several other scientific institutions,
will bring teachers together, often with top scientists, to rethink
the way science, math, and history are taught.
   Baltimore was invited to participate, along with the school
systems of San Francisco; San Diego and San Antonio, Texas; two
smaller systems in Georgia, and one in Wisconsin.
   ``To have Baltimore out there as one of the national leaders
would have been nice,'' F. James Rutherford, director of the
project, said in today's The (Baltimore) Sun.
   ``I must say, in a way it's sad, because Baltimore is really a
very special place. If it works, it will really be one of the most
important changes in education in a long time.''
   Hunter told Rutherford that he did not want to spare teachers
from the city's classrooms.
   The plan would have required 20 teachers to be out of class three
or four days a month, and meet during the summer as well, for the
next two to three years.
   ``I can't blame him,'' said Rutherford. ``Our project would put a
tremendous demand on a district. The superintendent felt that given
his agenda it was just too ambitious a project for him to get into.''
   Rutherford said the project, named for the year in which Halley's
Comet will return, plans to arrange for substitute teachers to help
districts that take part.

   Federal authorities said they will
seize the home of a 77-year-old blind man convicted last year of
selling crack cocaine from the house.
   Willie Frank Dudley was given two days Tuesday by the U.S.
Marshal's Service to move. He said he did not sell crack at the
house, but it was kept there. He denied having any involvement with
the drug himself.
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said.
   ``Blind people can be judges and bankers and can function in all
walks of life, and blind people also can become drug dealers, so
they're treated equally,'' Police Chief David Thompson said.
   Dudley has a criminal record that includes dealing crack cocaine
from the house, Thompson said. It was seized as a result of Dudley's
1988 arrest and conviction on the sale of crack.
   Dudley said he was blinded by a shooting in 1961 in front of the
house.
   The small wooden house and the half-acre of property are worth
about $20,000, Thompson said.
   The property was seized under the federal Controlled Substances
Act because police determined it had continually been used as a
storage place for crack cocaine, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Dorothea Beane.
   He can appeal the seizure by filing a claim of intent to hold
onto the property within 10 days.

   Rap musician Antonio M. Hardy, better known
as ``Big Daddy Kane,'' was arrested after he shot a man in the arm
while traveling aboard a chartered bus, police said Wednesday.
   Hardy, 20, of the borough of Brooklyn, was on his way from New
York City to an amusement park in North Hudson on Tuesday, where he
planned to make a music video. Sometime during the trip, he fired a
gun, state police said. The bullet ricocheted off a bus window and
struck 21-year-old Adrian M. White, said Sgt. Mike Downs.
   White, of Freeport, was treated at a hospital and released.
   Hardy pleaded guilty Tuesday afternoon in Schroon Lake Town Court
to third-degree assault and fourth-degree criminal possession of a

   A federal judge today threw out an NAACP
lawsuit seeking to remove the Confederate flag atop Alabama's
Capitol, ruling the banner did not violate the constitutional rights
of blacks.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Varner said the NAACP failed to show
that the flying of the flag somehow created a form of segregation.
   Former state Rep. Thomas Reed and 13 other black legislators
attempted to remove the flag in 1988 but were blocked by law
enforcement officers and arrested. They were convicted of
trespassing and fined.
   Later, Reed, state president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, and the NAACP sued to remove the
banner.
   ``Removal of the flag is suggested for the purpose of relieving a
feeling of Mr. Reed and his fellow blacks rather than for the
purpose of eliminating segregation in state government,'' Varner
wrote.
   He pointed out that Reed and other blacks were a part of state
government and had not been ostracized by any means.
   Gov. Guy Hunt has said he will remove the flag only at the
request of the Legislature, which has killed past such attempts.

   A former Red Army Faction terrorist was released
from prison Wednesday after serving 17 years of a life sentence for
killing a policeman.
   Manfred Grashof was convicted of killing a Hamburg policeman in a
1972 gun battle and of being an accessory to the murder of a second
police official during a 1971 bank robbery in Kaiserslautern.
   He was pardoned three months ago by former Rhineland-Palatinate
state governer Bernhard Vogel. The pardon specified the March 1
release date.
   Vogel said at the time that Grashof, 42, had ``clearly
demonstrated that he had renounced terrorism.''
   In June, Vogel pardoned Grashof's accomplice in the bank robbery,
Klaus Juenschke, who had also received a life sentence for murder.
   Terrorist pardons are an emotional issue in West Germany, with
proponents saying the government should show mercy where prisoners
repudiate violent crimes. Opponents contend terrorists should pay in
full for the bloody bombings and assassinations that rocked West
Germany in the late 1960s and 1970s.

   The mayor of Nagasaki received a bullet enclosed in

Hirohito bore some responsibility for World War II, a police

   It was the second time in a week Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima received

   The letter, signed by the unknown All Japan Patriotic Front, read
in part, ``You better quit soon. If not you may be killed,'' said
Akira Nagashima of the Nagasaki city police. Similar threatening
mail was delivered to Motoshima on Feb. 22.
   Nagashima said four policemen had been assigned to guard the
mayor to against rightist reprisals following his controversial
remarks about the emperor in December.
   At that time, Motoshima told a city assembly session that,
judging from historical accounts and his own wartime experience, ``I
believe the emperor shares responsibility for the war, as well as
all of us who lived in that period.''
   More than 100 sound trucks blaring rightist slogans drove through
Nagasaki streets to protest his remarks.

<TEXT>
   Richard M. Daley's Democratic primary victory over
Mayor Eugene Sawyer carried him to the door of the City Hall office
his father held for 21 years, but a new foe and an old nemesis want
to bar his entry.
   By defeating Sawyer Tuesday, Daley advanced to the April 4
general election and a contest Democrats have won without fail since
1931 _ including six straight terms captured by Richard J. Daley,
the late, legendary boss of Chicago politics.
   The 46-year-old white nominee faces third-party candidate
Alderman Timothy Evans, previously Sawyer's chief black rival and
now Jesse Jackson's choice. He also faces the Republican primary
winner, a title claimed by Edward Vrdolyak, who bucked GOP leaders
by launching a write-in candidacy a week ago.
   Daley, Cook County state's attorney, rarely invoked his father's
name during the primary, but he did in his victory statements and in
TV interviews this morning.
   ``I think my father's looking down upon me, on a beautiful, warm
day in Chicago ... very proud of me, and most importantly, proud of
the type of campaign that I ran in the last three months _ reaching
out to every community,'' Daley said.
   He dismissed suggestions that racial factors could split the vote
as it did in 1983, when he lost the nomination to the late Harold
Washington, the city's first black mayor.
   ``I'm not going to be vying for any one vote,'' he said. ``I'm
going to be vying for votes of everybody throughout this city. This
is a city made up of the black community, the white community, the
Asian community, the Hispanic community, and they're all stressing
issues. ... This will be a good clean election.''
   Daley recalled advice he received from his father, who died in
1976, three months into his third decade in office.
   ``You're going to have ups and downs, you're going to win, you're
going to lose,'' he recalled his father saying. ``Remember,
(choosing politics) is your decision.''
   With 2,843 of 2,911 precincts reporting, or 98 percent,
unofficial totals showed Daley with 481,370 votes, or 56 percent, to
367,919 votes, or 43 percent, for the black acting mayor. Three
other candidates shared the remaining votes.
   ``This is not the end of Eugene Sawyer,'' said the 54-year-old
Sawyer in conceding. ``I will continue to work ... to heal, to build
and to bring people together in this city.''
   Evans began the day today campaigning at an elevated train stop.
Pledging to crush the ``Daley machine,'' he asked the crowd
repeatedly ``Can we win?'' as supporters responded, ``Yes.''
   Vrdolyak had no formal appearances scheduled early today.
   Daley rode overwhelming white support to win, capping a
three-month campaign that was largely free of racial strife and, by
Chicago standards, rancor.
   But Vrdolyak, a former Democratic alderman and county party
chairman, could cut into that base if his write-in challenge is
successful. Vrdolyak won more than 80 percent of the white vote in
his unsuccessful 1987 third-party challenge against Washington.
   With 96 percent of 2,911 precincts reporting, unofficial results
gave Vrdolyak 10,711 votes, or 45 percent, to 10,234 votes, or 43
percent, to GOP endorsed candidate Dr. Herbert Sohn. Two others each
had 5 percent.
   ``You made history,'' Vrdolyak told cheering supporters. ``You
did something in seven days that no one has seen before. You showed
that you can write someone in for mayor of Chicago.''
   Sohn refused to concede and County GOP Chairman Jim Dvorak said
the race was too close to call. Because of the difficulty of
counting write-in votes, the outcome of the Republican race might
not be known before Thursday.
   If Daley faces Vrdolyak and Evans next month, the battle would be
reminiscent of the one Washington waged to become the city's first
black mayor.
   Washington narrowly won the 1983 Democratic primary when the
younger Daley and incumbent Jane Byrne split the white vote. He then
rode monolithic black support to squeak past Republican Bernard
Epton in a racially charged campaign.
   Washington gained additional support from liberal whites and
Hispanics to repeat in 1987, becoming the first mayor since the
elder Daley to win re-election.
   And also like the elder Daley, Washington died in office without
having annointed a successor, touching off a war between Sawyer and
Evans that caused a deep rift in the black community.
   Their struggle intensified after Sawyer was elected in December
1987 to succeed Washington by a City Council coalition of mostly
white aldermen. When the Illinois Supreme Court last November
ordered a special mayoral election to complete the final two years
of Washington's term, Evans said he would run a third-party bid to
give Sawyer ``a clear shot'' at Daley.
   But Sawyer supporters said Evans sabotaged the mayor's chances by
helping hold down black voter turnout and refusing Jackson's pleas
for black unity against Daley.
   ``The negative campaign launched by Alderman Evans ... lasted for
a long time _ and that caused some confusion in the black community.
It wasn't until really mid-January ... before we could bring it all
together and of course that had an impact,'' said Sawyer campaign
manager Reynard Rochon.
   In order to gain the mayoralty, Daley again will have to overcome
formidable opposition from Jackson, who engineered Sawyer's surge
among black voters in the waning days of the primary.
   Jackson said he felt no obligation to endorse Daley because he
did not receive Daley's backing when he ran unsuccessfully for the
Democratic presidential nomination last year.
   Evans and Jackson said the challenge would be to re-assemble the
coalition that elected Washington.
   ``Somebody has to rise above the eye-for-an-eye and break that
cycle of pain. ... The bitterness at this point is substantial,''
Jackson said.
   ``We believe that those who fought the Daley machine tonight
ought to be congratulated. They tried their best. We invite them now
to join with us,'' said Evans.

   A state appeals court today overturned the
murder conviction of Randall Dale Adams in the 1976 slaying of a
Dallas police officer, a case resurrected by the film ``The Thin
Blue Line.''
   In a unanimous decision, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said
prosecutors suppressed evidence during Adams' 1977 trial and used
perjured testimony.
   ``When deceit produces court rulings that have the effect of
denying one a fair trial, then the conviction should be vacated,''
wrote Judge M.P. Duncan.
   The appeals court ordered Adams transferred from prison to the
Dallas County jail. In Dallas, Assistant District Attorney Norm
Kinne said Adams will be held there while prosecutors decide whether
to retry him.
   ``We have one of the prosecutors reviewing evidence and
interviewing witnesses in the case. We're in process of determining
whether we have sufficient evidence for a retrial,'' the district
attorney said.
   Adams, 40, had maintained that he was innocent. He received the
death penalty in 1977 for the slaying of Officer Robert Wood, but
that sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1980. He has served
12 years behind bars.
   His case received wide public attention with ``The Thin Blue
Line,'' a documentary on the case in which the prosecution's chief
witness recanted.
   Defense attorney Randy Schaffer said he will seek Adams' release
on bail, and he predicted prosecutors would insist on a new trial.
``Not because they have any evidence,'' he said, ``but because of
the politics.''
   The appeals court reviewed the case on the recommendation of
state District Judge Larry Baraka, who said after a hearing in
December that Adams did not receive a fair trial.
   The appeals court said Adams' rights were violated when the state
knowingly suppressed evidence that a witness, Emily Miller, had
failed to identify Adams in a lineup; that a police officer advised
her she didn't identify Adams, and that the officer told her the
person she should have identified.
   The court also said Ms. Miller committed perjury by testifying,
outside the presence of the jury, that she had identified Adams in
the lineup.
   In his opinion, Duncan wrote: ``In the present case, the trial
court found the state was guilty of suppressing evidence favorable
to the accused, deceiving the trial court during applicant's trial,
and knowingly using perjured testimony. In each instance, the nature
of the evidence or testimony was such that beneficial results inured
to the state at the expense of due process.''
   Adams' mother, Mildred Adams of Columbus, Ohio, was overjoyed at
the news.
   ``We had planned on going down to TDC (Texas Department of
Corrections) over Easter break to see him,'' she told the Dallas
Times Herald. ``Now I just don't have the words to express myself.
We're just as happy as can be up here.''
   Adams' case was resurrected with the help of New York filmmaker
Errol Morris' documentary ``The Thin Blue Line,'' which strongly
suggested the slaying was committed by the prosecution's chief
witness, David Harris.
   ``I'm delighted,'' Morris said from Los Angeles. ``I very much
hope to be in Texas when he is released.''
   On Nov. 28, 1976, Adams, then 27, ran out of gas while driving
home from work. Harris, a Vidor 16-year-old who had stolen a car and
driven to Dallas, helped Adams get gas and spent the part of the day
with him.
   Wood was shot and killed that night by a motorist he had pulled
over on a traffic violation.
   Harris had testified that Adams killed Wood. But Harris recanted
in the movie and during a hearing in December. He is on Death Row
for another slaying.
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Parole on Friday had denied parole
for Adams after a special review. The board cited the violent nature
of the crime and use of a weapon.

   Sears' 824 stores across the nation began reopening today after a
42-hour facelift to complete price reductions on 1.5 billion pieces
of merchandise.
   ``People are backed up as far as we can see. It's wall-to-wall
people,'' said Bob Dumas, manager of the Sears, Roebuck and Co.
store at the Northland Mall in Columbus, Ohio.
   ``We have Christmas-quantity people, and we have better than
Christmas traffic,'' said Dumas, who estimated more than 1,000
people waited outside for the doors to open.
   Workers changed prices Tuesday on everything _ including light
bulbs, toasters and polished door knobs _ as Sears prepared for a
new retailing strategy it hopes will win customers.
   Employees also had to change signs and displays, take inventory
and clean up before the openings, which occurred at noon local time.
   ``The worst was the screwdrivers,'' said Chris Skinner, a high
school freshman who spent much of the day at the Northland Mall
store repricing baby booties and toddlers' dresses. ``You had to
take them all down, clean each one by hand, then put them all back.''all.
Otherwise, it will
use the strategy that retailers call ``everyday low pricing.''
   Sears, in adopting the strategy, joins a growing list, that
includes K mart Corp., Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target discount chain
and Montgomery Ward and Co.
   At the Columbus store, 700 workers scrambled to the tune of
``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' as they marked down items such as twin
canopy beds from $269.99 to $99.00, a Diehard automobile battery
from $72 to $64, and a Craftsman power drill from $59.99 to $32.62.
   Sears' new strategy meant reductions on 75 percent of its own
brands and the 1,000 other brand names it carries.
   ``I don't think they had any choice. They lost their customer
base,'' said Karen Sacks, an analyst with Standard and Poor's Corp.
in New York. ``I think Wednesday will be a madhouse at Sears. But
will they be able to re-educate their customers not to come in just
for a sale?''
   Monroe Greenstein, an analyst with the investment firm Bear
Stearns in New York, said the strategy paid off in Wichita, Kan.,
where sales rose 15 percent when Sears tested the idea last fall.
   ``And Sears will invest in an advertising campaign that, to not
hear about it, you would practically have to be comatose,''
Greenstein said.
   The cash register rings about 3,000 times a day in the
100,000-square-foot Columbus store, but the only sound in the last
couple of days was the clicking of pricing guns and muffled sounds
of store officials keeping in touch with walkie-talkies.
   About 100 high school students worked for $5 an hour to help
company officials in shirt-sleeves and scores of others with the
makeover.
   ``It's the most exciting thing I've ever been involved in in
Sears,'' said Bob Dumas, manager of the Northland Mall store and a
30-year Sears employee.
   ``It's no longer that old sea of yellow,'' he said, referring to
Sears' old yellow-with-black-lettering sale signs.
   The new signs, touting new, lower prices, are in vibrant red and
blue. In apparel, the signs are magenta and gray.
   ``They really needed to do something dramatic like that,'' Ms.
Sacks said. ``We'll just have to wait a year or two to see if it
works.''

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Refers Moonlighting Questions To Others</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Top 7 grafs new with decisions on outside income. Picks up 3rd

<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's ethics commission agreed today
there should be a uniform limit on the outside income earned by top
government officials but called on Congress to set the limit and let
the President exempt some activities, such as scholarly writing.
   The eight-member panel completed its fifth and final working day
still sharply divided over moonlighting by judges, members of
Congress, top executive branch officials and the most senior aides
in all three branches.
   Their compromise recommendation was that Congress limit outside
earned income to a fixed percentage of an official's federal salary.
A majority of the group favored a figure closer to the 15 percent
which nows governs the executive branch rather than the higher
amounts allowed in Congress and the judiciary.
   And they asked that Congress allow to the president to exempt
from the limit income from categories of work that do not raise
ethical issues or interfere with the full performance of official
duties.
   They tried but failed to agree on a list of exemptions. Former
White House counsel Lloyd Cutler suggested listing teaching by
judges, among others. But former Attorney General Griffin Bell, who
wanted to exempt royalties, objected to exempting teaching.
   ``When you get above 15 percent of salary for teaching, you're
not a fulltime government worker,'' Bell said. ``You're not in your
office when you're teaching and you need to be there so other judges
can talk to you.''
   With that compromise, the panel completed work on the
recommendations due to go to Bush by March 9. The issue of
moonlighting income was the most divisive it encountered in a review
of all federal ethics laws and rules. This issue had consumed more
than an hour of debate on Tuesday.
   The panel was wrestling with questions such as how much money a
federal judge should be allowed to make teaching at a law school,
and whether federal officials should be allowed to make more money
writing novels or songs than from the government.
   These questions about the proper limits of income earned outside
government work have divided the commission more sharply than any
others it has confronted in four day-long meetings.
   The panel could not decide Tuesday whether to recommend a ceiling
on all outside earned income or whether certain activities should be
exempt from any ceiling because they pose no conflict of interest.
   At one point, former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler argued,
``Suppose you write a popular song one night; that doesn't belong to
the government.''
   To which former Attorney General Griffin Bell replied, ``We don't
want a government of songwriters.''
   Last week, the panel tentatively approved applying the executive
branch's outside-income limit _ 15 percent of the government salary,
with no exemptions _ to top officials of all three branches. There
is no limit now for judges; the House limits members to 30 percent
of salary and the Senate to 40 percent.
   Cutler argued, ``If the next Ernest Hemingway is deep in the
Internal Revenue Service, all he can get out of it is 15 percent of
a GS-14 salary or he'd have to quit.''
   Judy Bello, general counsel to the U.S. special trade
representative, replied that the ceiling would only apply to top
officials, at GS-17 and above.
   Cutler, however, found other examples: ``Suppose you work for the
Defense Department on the MX missile and you develop an idea for
hybrid corn one night that's worth $1 million _ you've got to give
it away.''
   ``I will dissent from a cap unless there are some totally
excepted categories of earned income, such as writing a popular
song,'' he said.
   Cutler said he had been called by a federal judge whose teaching
and legal writings bring him income greater than 15 percent of his
federal salary. He said the judge said he would quit the bench if
the cap were enacted by Congress.
   ``A judge teaching at an accredited law school is a fine activity
and there is not the shadow of the possibility of a conflict,''
Cutler said.
   Bell, who is a former appellate judge, responded, ``If you want
to be a judge, you ought to be a full-time judge.''
   Bell also said exemptions would send the message that ``we don't
think it's unethical not to give your full-time effort to your
government job.''
   Bello also backed the ceiling. ``I wouldn't want to drive a good
judge off the bench, but ... I oppose watering down the current
law.''
   ``These activities do take time from your work,'' she added.
``And public confidence can be undermined if public servants are
taking time from work.''
   The panel's chairman, Malcolm R. Wilkey, a former appellate
judge, advocated the exemptions, particularly for judges to teach
law. ``This interplay between a live judge and a law school is very
vital to our society.''
   If there are no exemptions, Wilkey said, ``We'll lose the
brightest minds _ people who've got the extra energy to do more
work. They're the big contributors to our society and we'll lose
them from government.''
   Fred Fielding, who was White House counsel for President Reagan,
said the panel seemed to be ignoring other kinds of outside earned
income, such as breeding race horses or rose-growing. Seeing no
reason to discriminate in favor of some outside activities over
others, Fielding said he leaned toward a cap.

   The Bush administration missed two more
congressional deadlines Wednesday for staking out positions on major
defense issues, saying it wasn't ready to produce reports dealing
with Star Wars and the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Col. Miguel Monteverde, a Pentagon spokesman, said acting Defense
Secretary William H. Taft IV was notifying Congress that the March 1
deadline for the Star Wars report would be missed because the future
of the anti-missile defense system is being addressed in a much
broader White House strategic policy review.
   The Air Force, in a brief statement, said the report on the B-2
would not go forward Wednesday because it was ``still in
coordination.''
   An Air Force official who asked not to be named said, however,
that that report also was being delayed until the national security
review was completed.
   President Bush, in his budget address to Congress, announced last
month he had ordered the broad policy review and said he expected it
to be completed within 90 days.
   On Feb. 15, the White House cited the same review as the reason
it would not meet a deadline for choosing between two mobile nuclear
missiles _ the single-warhead Midgetman or a rail-car version of the
10-warhead MX.
   The missed deadlines come at the same time Bush has been unable
to win Senate confirmation of his choice as defense secretary,
former Sen. John Tower of Texas.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater and other administration
officials have insisted that Tower's troubles are not responsible
for the failure to meet the congressional deadlines.
   Rather, they assert that those deadlines were set much too early
for a new administration and that Bush wants to take the time to
review the nation's entire strategic posture.
   Other officials at the Pentagon, however, say little in the way
of policy formation is being accomplished at the Defense Department
because of the lack of leadership. Those officials, holdovers from
the Reagan administration, spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The first report that had been due Wednesday dealt with one
deployment option for a Star Wars system _ the so-called ALPS or
Accidental Launch Protection System.
   First suggested by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, ALPS would entail the construction
of a small missile-defense system capable of stopping a missile
fired by accident or by a terrorist group.
   The second report due Wednesday involved the Air Force's B-2, a
new bomber that is supposed to be almost invisible to radar. The
first of the bombers was unveiled in November but has not yet flown.
   The Air Force wants to build 132 of the planes, but estimated in
December that, counting research and development costs, the bombers
would cost more than $500 million each. Even if research and
development expenses are discounted, each plane will cost $305
million to build.
   Faced with that kind of expense, Congress said it wanted a report
by March 1 ``setting forth the total program cost, in constant and
in current dollars, of the Advanced Technology B-2 Bomber program.''

<TEXT>
   The city's third-party Progressive
Coalition is gearing up for an election in which it hopes to prove
that it can outlast its charismatic leader, Mayor Bernie Sanders.
   Sanders, often billed as the nation's only socialist mayor,
announced last fall that he would not seek a fifth term in city
elections March 7. He said he wants other Progressives to move up
the electoral ladder, in part to dispel the notion that the movement
is a ``one-man band.'' He plans to teach and write.
   Sanders, 47, was elected by 10 votes in 1981 over a 10-year Mayor
Gordon Paquette and a Democratic machine widely seen as having
atrophied. He promptly put his long-time leftist activism to work
building a political power base of his own in the Progressive
Coalition.
   He was re-elected three times by more comfortable margins,
winning in 1987 with 6,901 votes to 5,594 votes. And even his
critics, with a mixture of bemusement and grudging admiration, give
him credit for reinvigorating city politics.
   ``He brought a breath of fresh air to City Hall,'' said Patrick
Robins, owner of an office supply company and long-time Democratic
regular.
   U.S. News and World Report, not a publication known for radical
politics, picked Sanders in 1987 as one of the nation's 20 best
mayors. Meanwhile, Burlington, a city of 38,000 and the closest
thing Vermont has to a metropolitan area, has prospered and been
ranked high in national quality-of-life surveys.
   Love him or hate him, Robins said, ``Bernie Sanders will be a
tough act to follow.''
   A month ago, it looked as though Burlington's Progressive era
might end with Sanders' departure. The coalition picked as his
would-be successor Peter Clavelle, a city administrator with no
experience running for office and without the rhetorical flair and
propensity for bashing American corporate capitalism that has given
Sanders a national reputation.
   Clavelle, 39, faces tough opposition from Democrat Nancy Chioffi,
46, president of the Board of Aldermen and owner of a downtown
clothing and souvenir store. She has not only the Democratic
nomination, but support from Republicans. The GOP didn't even field
a candidate.
   Attacking Clavelle from the left is 48-year-old lawyer Sandra
Baird, whose fledgling Vermont Greens party advocates a moratorium
on ``development for profit.'' She denounces Sanders and Clavelle,
saying they've ``sold out'' to business interests.
   Initially, many political observers thought Clavelle was in
trouble, facing a single candidate backed by Democrats and
Republicans and likely to lose some of the hard-core left to Baird.
He also was criticized as bland, a mumbler unable to articulate
strong beliefs.
   But Clavelle appears to have turned things around, picking up
several key labor endorsements, solidifying support among peace
activists and Jesse Jackson Democrats.
   Clavelle, who helped develop several programs for women as chief
of the city's Community Economic Development Office, even picked up
an endorsement over his two female opponents from the local chapter
of the National Organization for Women. That was seen as a coup in a
university town with a strong feminist community.
   ``They're going to win, it's that simple,'' University of Vermont
political scientist Garrison Nelson said of Clavelle and the
Progressives.
   Nelson's view was supported by a poll published Sunday in The
Burlington Free Press, which showed Clavelle with 40 percent of
likely voters supporting him, 31 percent for Chioffi, 6 percent for
Baird, and 2 percent for Michael Hackett, an independent candidate
running on what he calls the ``tax revolt'' ticket.
   The telephone poll of 342 likely voters found 21 percent
undecided or refusing to answer. It had a margin of error of 6.5
percent. Those two factors appeared to leave open the possibility
that Chioffi still could win the race.
   Chioffi has emphasized her experience as a small business owner
and her belief that men and women and rich and poor are equal by
virtue of opportunity.
   ``(Clavelle) talks about helping the little guy, about helping
single mothers and poverty-stricken women,'' she told the Free
Press. ``I don't see anybody as being a little guy. Working people
are not little.''
   But that pitch of equality of opportunity has not resonated much
in a city schooled on eight years of Sanders' speeches about class
struggle.
   Clavelle says he will maintain the ideals of the city's
Progressives. He angered some of them when in his first batch of
campaign literature, he described himself as an ``independent''
rather than as a Progressive. And he does not embrace the socialist
label as Sanders does.
   But he says he wants to look out for the elderly, the poor and
``the little guy.''
   ``I'm no Bernie Sanders,'' Clavelle said. ``Our backgrounds are
different, our styles are different, but our political visions are
the same.''

   A man who police say once threw money to
children in poor neighborhoods and later was charged with trying to
sell cocaine changed his plea to guilty after seeing a jury of ``14
mothers with kids,'' his lawyer says.
   Kevin Allen Walker ``knows he made a mistake and he's ready to
pay the price,'' attorney Earl Gray said Tuesday. Walker, 27,
pleaded guilty Tuesday after an all-woman jury had been selected.
   ``We picked a jury and saw 14 mothers with kids and saw they were
against drugs,'' Gray said.
   Police said they found two pounds of cocaine, three guns and
$57,800 when they searched a car Walker was using.
   Walker had been accused of sending children in one of St. Paul's
poorest neighborhoods into frenzies by flinging bills as large as
$50s from the sunroof of his car. The act was captured on home video
by a neighborhood activist who shoed it to police.
   Gray denied the tapes pictured his client, but said the suspicion
it created brought Walker to the attention of the police. ``That's
why the cops went after him,'' Gray said.

<TEXT>
   A Northwest Orient DC-10 en route from Frankfurt to
Boston diverted to London's Gatwick Airport today after one engine
stalled, the airline said.
   Flight 47 touched down at Gatwick at 2:34 p.m. ``after a routine
two-engine landing'' and the 222 passengers and 10 crew disembarked
normally, an airline statement said.
   Airline spokesman Andy Plews said the No. 2 engine stalled on
takeoff from Frankfurt ``and instead of trying to restart the engine
in flight, the captain decided to divert to London Gatwick.''
   Mechanics checked out the engine on the tarmac, running it up to
full power in a test, ``and discovered that there was no problem
with it,'' he said.
   With its ``clean bill of health,'' Plews said, Northwest Orient
was assembling a new crew and planned to take off for Boston later
tonight.
   Meanwhile, he said, passengers were taken to an airport hotel for
dinner.
   Asked what might have caused the engine not to start, Plews said,
``We don't know, but it is possible for engines to do this
occasionally. It could be a lack of air flow through the engine
which can be caused by an atmospheric condition.''

   The Senate voted 99-0 today to confirm James D.
Watkins as energy secretary, handing the retired admiral the
``daunting challenge'' of refurbishing the Energy Department's
crippled network of nuclear weapons factories.
   The vote came less than four hours after the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee voted 19-0 to recommend that Watkins,
61, be made the first career military man to head the department
since it was created in 1977.
   J. Bennett Johnston, D.-La., chairman of the committee, told the
Senate that the job of reviving and cleaning up the nuclear weapons
complex was a top priority.
   ``It is perhaps the most daunting challenge that we have ever
given to anybody in the Cabinet ... anytime in the history of this
country,'' Johnston said.
   Johnston called Watkins ``a man of that substance and that
reputation,'' echoing the warm praise Watkins won during his
confirmation hearing last Wednesday.
   Although he has no experience in the conventional energy field,
Watkins developed an expertise in nuclear power during a 41-year
Navy career that included training in reactor technology as well as
the command of a nuclear submarine.
   Now he's about to enter battle against one of the Bush
administration's biggest challenges: revitalizing the Energy
Department's nuclear weapons complex and planning a long-range
cleanup operation that may cost $100 billion.
   The Energy Department spends about two-thirds of its budget,
which this year is $14 billion, on developing, building and testing
nuclear weapons for the Pentagon. The remaining one-third is spent
on conventional energy projects, mainly research.
   Key parts of the 12-state weapons complex are shut down because
of safety, technical and managerial concerns, leaving the United
States without the capacity to build nuclear weapons for the first
time since the dawn of the nuclear age.
   ``It's the most daunting management task I think we've ever given
to anybody I've seen in government,'' Sen. J. Bennett Johnston,
D-La., said during Watkins' Feb. 22 hearing.
   Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho, said that although the weapons
plant problems were created by past administrations, ``You, Admiral
Watkins, will be the man in the limelight or hotseat charged with
getting the situation effectively under control as quickly as
possible.''
   Watkins told his confirmation hearing the Energy Department's
weapons complex was ``antique, out-of-date, desperately in need of
change.'' He also ripped the department's management structure,
calling it ``a mess'' and vowing to install the core of a new
management team to oversee the plants within six months.
   Watkins is a 1949 graduate of the Naval Academy at Annapolis,
Md., and was hand-picked by the late admiral Hyman G. Rickover,
father of the modern nuclear Navy. He served as a submarine
commander, cruiser and destroyer force commander of the Seventh
Fleet and NATO commander of the Sixth Fleet before capping his
career as chief of naval operations, the service's top position. He
retired in 1986.
   The four-star admiral is not shy about stressing his relationship
with Rickover.
   ``I learned from him that the fulfillment of the mission of our
national defense and the protection of the environment were mutually
compatible objectives,'' Watkins told his confirmation hearing.
   He said one of his top priorities as energy secretary would be to
cultivate in department managers a commitment to safe operations of
the nuclear complex.
   ``All that fancy technology is useless, and perhaps even a threat
to society, unless we properly educate and train those entrusted
with its operation,'' he said.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo signed a new agreement to
buy the $5.4 billion Shoreham nuclear plant for $1 and dismantle it,
and a key lawmaker today said he likes the deal.
   Under the agreement, the Long Island Lighting Co. will let the
state tear down the never-used plant, which has had to wage
licensing battles since its completion in 1985 and nearly bankrupted
the utility with cost overruns and delays.
   ``It is time to end this matter once and for all and turn our
energies to new, productive measures for Long Island and the
state,'' Cuomo said Tuesday.
   Unlike a similar agreement last year, which was killed by state
legislators, Cuomo predicted this deal would succeed because it
largely bypasses the Legislature.
   State Senate Majority Leader Ralph Marino, a Long Island
Republican whose support for the plan is crucial to its success,
said today that he likes the deal. Shoreham is on Long Island, 55
miles from Manhattan.
   ``I think we should get the issue behind us, at least have some
kind of direction and this gives us stability,'' Marino said.
   Other reaction was mixed.
   Long Island business leaders contend the $2.5 billion loss that
Lilco plans to take on the plant during the next three years will be
passed to its customers, who already pay among the nation's highest
electric bills.
   Jack Kulka, of the Association for a Better Long Island, said his
business group was ``very, very skeptical'' because ``Shoreham
continues to rise from the dead.''
   But Suffolk County Executive Patrick Halpin, whose county is
where the plant is located, said: ``I am pleased that Long Island's
longest-running soap opera has finally gotten its cancellation
notice.''
   In December, the state Legislature refused to act on a deal
negotiated in June by Cuomo with the utility that would also have
had the state buy the plant for $1 and dismantle it. In that deal,
Lilco would have been guaranteed 5 percent rate increases for at
least three years, and possibly for a decade.
   At the time, key lawmakers said the deal was too expensive for
Lilco customers. Cuomo said the legislators were simply afraid to
face a politically tough situation.
   Under Tuesday's agreement, Lilco is guaranteed no particular
rates, which are decided by the state Public Service Commission.
Cuomo predicted the rates would be lower than proposed in the
earlier deal, probably less than 4.5 percent.
   ``Nobody is going to be responsible for the rates,'' quipped
Cuomo. ``It's wonderful.''
   Last week, however, the commission approved a temporary 5.4
percent rate increase for the utility.
   Cuomo said he made the new deal because he believed the federal
Nuclear Regulatory Commission was about to grant Lilco a license to
operate the plant at 25 percent of full power.
   The NRC last week announced a proposed rule change aimed at
revitalizing the nation's nuclear power industry by cutting down the
licensing process for plants to six years or less, compared with the
recent average of 13 years.
   Many utilities, swamped by debt from nuclear plant construction,
contend that long delays in obtaining an NRC license are a main
reason why no new plants have been ordered since the mid-1970s.
   The 800-megawatt Shoreham plant, which was proposed in 1966, has
thus far been unable to win anything more than a 5 percent testing
license from federal officials. That's largely due to the refusal of
Cuomo and Long Island officials to cooperate in emergency planning
for the plant.
   Cuomo and the officials long have argued that Shoreham should
never be allowed to open because the area around the plant couldn't
be safely evacuated during a nuclear emergency. Lilco disputed that.
   Tuesday's agreement is subject to approval by Lilco's board of
directors and shareholders, a process that utility spokesman Jim
Lois said would ``take approximately three months.''
   ``While the approvals for this agreement are being obtained, the
company will continue to vigorously pursue a full power operating
license for Shoreham before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,''
said a Lilco statement.
   However, it said it would operate the plant only if shareholders
veto the agreement, which also requires approval by the Public
Service Commission, the state Power Authority and the Long Island
Power Authority.
   Assemblyman Paul Harenberg of Suffolk called the new agreement
``very unfortunate'' and said Cuomo is ``forcing the public to pay
for the foolishness and imprudence of the investors of Lilco.''

   The Senate today voted 98-1 in favor of the
nomination of Dr. Louis Sullivan as Health and Human Services
secretary, saying he will be ``a caring advocate'' for millions of
poor Americans.
   The sole dissenting vote was cast by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
who said he was disturbed that Sullivan has declined to take a final
position on several abortion-related issues, including whether the
federal government should back medical research using tissue from
aborted fetuses.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, praised the Atlanta doctor's
commitment to providing health care for the needy and said his
policies at HHS will define President Bush's call for a ``kinder,
gentler America.'' Sullivan will be the only black in Bush's Cabinet.
   ``I am confident Dr. Sullivan is going to be a caring advocate
for these millions of Americans,'' Bentsen said as Republicans and
Democrats alike praised the nomination.
   Helms said that ``as a matter of conscience'' he could not vote
for Sullivan based on ``his failure or refusal to take a position on
a number of extremely important issues,'' all of which were related
to abortion.
   Helms said that because he supports the views of the
anti-abortion community, which opposes research using aborted fetal
tissue, ``I cannot turn my back on that opinion.''
   Sullivan won 19-0 approval in the Senate Finance Committee last
week and no opposition surfaced Monday at a courtesy hearing before
the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, which did not vote
separately on the nomination.
   As the 55-year-old blood specialist and medical school founder
moved toward confirmation, the Senate voted 99-0 to approve retired
Adm. James D. Watkins, as energy secretary. The action came a few
hours after the Energy and Natural Resources Committee endorsed
Watkins' nomination, 19-0.
   Meanwhile, in other action on Capitol Hill involving Bush
appointees:
   _William Bennett, the former education secretary who has been
named to the new post of chief drug enforcement executive, was
appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Chairman Joseph
Biden, D-Del., struggled eight years to create the position.
   _Edward J. Derwinski, the former Illinois congressman and
undersecretary of state, was appearing for the second straight time
before the Veterans Affairs Committee on his nomination to head the
new Veterans Affairs Department.
   Most senators on the two committees before which Sullivan
testified were highly complimentary of Sullivan, who founded the
Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta and will step down as its
president to take the HHS job.
   Few displayed much interest in Sullivan's views on abortion, an
issue that has caused controversy for the nominee since his remarks
in the Atlanta Journal Constitution that he favored abortion rights
and to Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., that he supported the Supreme
Court decision that legalized abortion.
   Abortion opponents pounced on the statements and demanded
assurances from the Bush administration that Sullivan's HHS policies
would conform to the views of the president when it came to abortion.
   At his confirmation hearing before the Finance Committee,
Sullivan apologized to Packwood, the ranking Republican on the
panel, for having ``misspoken'' his position on abortion.
   At each hearing he repeated that he shares President Bush's views
on the issue: He opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or
danger to the mother's life. He also said that, like Bush, he
opposes federal funding for abortions except when the mother's life
is threatened and would welcome a Supreme Court decision overturning
its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
   Sullivan, however, declined to take a final position on whether
the federal government should back medical research using tissue
from aborted fetuses. He said he would not do ``anything to
encourage abortion in order to get fetal tissue,'' but he said he
wanted to review an advisory committee's recommendations before
stating a further position on the issue.
   Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., an abortion foe, accused him of
``ducking'' the question and voted ``present'' on his nomination in
committee.
   Sullivan, a personal friend of the Bushes, is set to take the
reins of the largest department in the federal bureaucracy,
controlling a budget of nearly $400 billion and managing 114,000
employees.
   HHS, which administers a third of all federal spending, includes
Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, the Food and Drug
Administration and the U.S. Public Health Service.
   Sullivan was to be sworn in immediately after his confirmation,
although a formal ceremony is scheduled for March 10.

   Nellis Air Force Base officials are rethinking a
policy on dealing with juveniles after an 8-year-old boy was
arrested for hitting a security guard in the face with a pencil.
   Authorities say the boy was arrested by base security police,
charged with battery, read his rights and turned over to local
authorities. He was later released to his parents and the charges
were dropped.
   The arrest occurred after the boy tossed the pencil out the
window of a school bus, striking a sentry guarding the entrance to
the base on the northern edge of Las Vegas.
   The sentry was not hurt.
   Security guards boarded the bus and took the boy into custody
after he admitted tossing the pencil.
   Nellis officials said the boy was arrested under a new policy
designed to crack down on juvenile vandalism. They admit the boy's
actions may not have fallen under the vandalism category and say the
policy may be revised but not dropped.
   ``We could have handled it with more sensitivity,'' Maj. Victor
Andrijauskas, base spokesman, said Tuesday. ``Because of this
situation, the policy is being reviewed.''
   The boy's father, Sgt. Jim Warner, who works on the base,
declined to allow the family to discuss the matter publicly.

<TEXT>
   Radar has pinpointed an object believed to be the
cargo door that tore from a United Airlines jumbo jet, but federal
investigators say they aren't sure whether it can be retrieved from
under 16,800 feet of water.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said late Tuesday that
Navy radar tracked a large object 85 miles southwest of Honolulu
about 45 seconds after the pilot of Flight 811 reported an in-flight
emergency.
   Nine passengers were swept to their deaths when a 10-by-20 foot
section of the fuselage, including the cargo door, tore from the
right side of the Boeing 747 at 22,000 feet on Friday. Twenty-seven
others were treated for injuries.
   ``The radar picked up something that could be a large piece of
metal, possibly the cargo door,'' NTSB investigator Lee Dickinson
said Tuesday night.
   ``That information is going back to Washington, D.C., to see if
we can indeed determine ... that was the cargo door, and its exact
location.''
   Dickinson said the door would be ``very helpful to us in our
analysis,'' but added that he did not know whether the object could
be salvaged and the decision to try would be up to the full
five-member NTSB board.
   ``We have the location at the surface of the water,'' he said.
``You're talking about three miles (down), one can only guess where
that is.''
   Paul Wolcott, a technician and research submarine pilot at the
Hawaii Undersea Research Lab at the University of Hawaii, today said
the Navy is about the only agency with equipment capable of
recovering the door.
   Such a search would probably involve use of an underwater sonar
sled and a remote-controlled vehicle equipped with a camera, he
said. The vehicle could probably hook a line to the door so it could
be lifted to the surface, he said. The least likely possibility
because of the tremendous expense _ up to $40,000 a day _ would be
the Navy's Sea Cliff, one of the world's few manned research
submarines capable of reaching that depth, Wolcott said.
   Dickinson said the NTSB's field work was nearly completed and
investigators would leave Hawaii today and tomorrow.
   Earlier Tuesday, investigators reported that the same front right
cargo door had had a recent history of problems, including a seal
that was repaired in January.
   Investigators had not yet determined whether the recent repairs
were connected to the accident, said NTSB spokeswoman Drucella
Anderson.
   ``We just don't know that right now,'' she said.
   United Airlines spokesman Rob Doughty said the faulty door seal
had to be fixed before the plane could fly again, and other
electrical problems did not affect the plane's airworthiness.
   On Dec. 5, the door's electrical door-closing mechanism worked
intermittently, Doughty said. It was repaired, but failed again on
Dec. 13 and Dec. 22, he said. It was fixed in Chicago on Dec. 23 and
no further trouble was reported, he said.
   ``I might add, though, that it is completely proper to close this
door manually, and that's what was done,'' he said.
   Doughty said he did not know the details of the work on the
door's seal, but ``I don't think it was major.''
   Meanwhile Tuesday, United officials said a safety pin had to be
replaced in a rear cargo door of a Boeing 747 that was to fly from
Sydney, Australia. The repair delayed the arrival in Honolulu by 18
hours.
   Many passengers, however, said they did not mind the delay,
including Allen Hochberg of New York.
   ``How can you get aggravated at them for trying to save us?'' he
asked.

   A man who picked up parcels the Customs
Service had singled out as suspicious was charged with smuggling
more than $500,000 worth of anabolic steroids into the United States
from Brazil, authorities said.
   About 135,000 doses of the body-building drug in pill and
injection form were seized over the weekend, said Edgar Adamson,
customs agent in charge in Los Angeles.
   ``At one time, at one location, this is the largest shipment ever
confiscated, we believe,'' Adamson said.
   Lowell D. Coble, 49, was charged in federal court on Tuesday with
four counts of smuggling and possessing the drugs for distribution.
The charges are punishable by up to eight years in prison and a
$500,000 fine.
   Coble was freed on $25,000 bond, said Garry Grotewold,
supervisory deputy for the U.S. Marshal's office.
   Authorities said a Customs Service mail technician at Los Angeles
International Airport spotted several suspicious looking parcels
marked for delivery to a Southern California post office box.
   After Coble picked up the parcels and was arrested, authorities
found lists indicated he had customers throughout the United States,
according to a customs affidavit.
   ``Steroid seizures have been increasing rapidly during the past
three years, with about a tenfold increase every year,'' said John
Hensley, assistant regional commissioner for the Customs Service.
``Last year, customs seized over 2 million units of steroids
nationwide.''
   Steroids are used to increase strength and muscle bulk, making
them popular among body builders. They are illegal if bought, sold
or imported without a prescription.
   Health experts say prolonged use of the drug without proper
medical supervision can contribute to heart trouble, sexual and
reproductive disorders, immune deficiencies, liver problems,
psychological disturbances and growth disorders.

   The Marine Corps relieved 15 recruiters and
their commander of their duties in Pittsburgh for alleged
violations, including fabricating high school diplomas for recruits,
a newspaper reported today.
   The Pittsburgh Press quoted Marine Maj. Robert W. McLean, a corps
spokesman at Parris Island, S.C., as saying that six of the
recruiters face courts-martial on charges that will be filed within
the next few weeks.
   Punishment for the nine others ranged from forfeiture of pay to
letters of reprimand, he said.
   Investigators found recruiters provided as many as 17 diplomas
for recruits who never graduated from high school, the newspaper
said.
   In addition, the criminal records of some recruits were omitted
from enlistment papers, as were medical problems that could have
disqualified recruits from serving, the Press said.
   The investigation began in January after a suburban Pittsburgh
recruit became ill at boot camp on Parris Island and had to be
hospitalized for a severe ulcer his mother says she reported to the
recruiter, the newspaper said.
   Investigators later identified 82 others who may have been
recruited improperly.
   Thirty of the 83 recruits were discharged because of enlistment
problems, McLean said. The Corps retained 49 and has yet decided
what to do with the others.
   The head of the Pittsburgh recruiting office, Maj. George A.
Eberhart Jr., was relieved Feb. 14 of duties he had held since 1986.
   Maj. Donald Kappel, a corps spokesman in the Philadelphia
district headquarters, today confirmed that an investigation led to
the 15 recruiters being relieved of duty, but he declined to provide
other details.

<HEAD>Libya Could Easily Share Chemical Weapons: Webster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIA Director William Webster said Wednesday
Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi's chemical weapons plant is so big
that he could easily share its output with other radical nations.
   ``The production capability is far more than Col. Gadhafi could
ever need or use by any stretch of the imagination,'' Webster told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``Is this going to become just another form of currency, ... a
brokering capability?'' he asked.
   Webster also said Libya could have the capacity of targeting such
countries as Israel with chemical weapons if Gadhafi's forces obtain
air-to-air refueling capacity for their bombers.
   ``It moves it (the chemical weapons threat) off the battlefields
and puts it into the cities and strategic areas'' of the whole
Middle East, he said.
   Webster was asked by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., if elements of the
West German armed forces had aided Libyan efforts to obtain
air-to-air refueling capability.
   Webster said he would prefer to discuss the matter in a closed,
non-public session but told Helms, ``You're right on target.''
   Webster later declined to elaborate on his comment.
   Gadhafi has said the plant was built to produce pharmaceuticals,
not chemical weapons. Webster said that even if that were true the
facility could be converted to manufacture weapons within a day's
time.
   The CIA director did say, as he and other U.S. officials have
said before, that West German corporations as well as those from
other European and Asian countries have helped Libya acquire a
chemical weapons production capability, and that it ``would have
been virtually impossible'' for Libya to do that without such help.
   But he said the West German government _ after a period of
hesitation _ has become more willing to address the situation and is
moving to tighten export controls on the chemicals and technologies
needed to produce chemical weapons.
   Webster said that while there was an initial ``slowness'' on the
part of some countries to accept available intelligence information
that a problem of chemical weapons proliferation existed, that is no
longer true.

<HEAD>Actor Continues To Oppose Mandatory Helmet Law Despite Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Gary Busey, an outspoken
opponent of mandatory motorcycle helmet laws, said Wednesday that
his near-fatal crash had not changed his mind.
   ``I could be a vegetable'' if he had worn a helmet, Busey said
during a news conference, his first public appearance since the Dec.
4 accident. He conceded that helmets should be mandatory for riders
ages 16 to 21.
   But Busey, 44, said he will continue to oppose laws requiring all
motorcyclists to wear helmets. Claiming his position was
``pro-choice,'' Busey argued that helmets impair motorcyclists'
peripheral vision, hearing and neck movement.
   He said his brain surgeons told him a helmet would not have
lessened his injuries. He had a visible scar from his right ear to
the top of his head.
   ``I could have been more seriously injured'' with a helmet, Busey
said. ``I could have broken my neck.''
   Busey said he was suffering some ``post-traumatic amnesia,'' but
that ``I feel real good to be here. ... It's good to be alive.'' He
described his recovery as nearly 100 percent complete.
   He blamed his accident, in which his head struck a curb, on a
combination of excessive speed and an oil puddle.
   ``If I had been going 25 (mph), I would have seen the oil,'' he
said.
   Busey said he is eager to return to work on the film ``Howling at
the Moon,'' put on hold when he was injured.
   Busey underwent surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, then was
transferred to Daniel Freeman Hospital for rehabilitation.
   Busey gained fame from his performance in the title role in ``The
Buddy Holly Story'' in 1978. His other credits include ``Lethal
Weapon,'' ``A Star is Born,'' ``Carny'' and ``The Bear.''

   A judge Wednesday allowed R. Gene
Simmons, convicted of killing 14 relatives and two other people, to
waive his appeal and face possible execution March 16.
   Under a state Supreme Court ruling in an earlier Simmons case,
the waiver of his right to appeal will be reviewed by the high court.
   The execution was scheduled after Simmons was convicted of
capital murder in February for the slaying of 14 relatives whose
bodies were found in and around Simmons' property near Dover at
Christmastime in 1987.
   Last May, Simmons was convicted of capital murder for killing two
people during a 40-minute shooting rampage in Russellville on Dec.
28, 1987. He told the court at that time that he wanted to die and
did not want any appeals.
   Testifying Wednesday, Simmons said he knew about his rights and
wanted the execution to proceed without delay.
   Circuit Court Judge John Patterson granted his waiver request.

<HEAD>Excerpts from Deficit Commission Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the majority and
minority reports of the National Economic Commission, which were
submitted to President Bush and congressional leaders Wednesday.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>MAJORITY REPORT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   
   As the United States approaches the 1990s, and with the economy
continuing to expand dynamically, economic policy, shaped to some
extent by the Federal Reserve, should be designed not only to
sustain economic growth in the near term, but to help create the
national wealth that will be the basis for future growth.
   Budget deficits are a direct drain on the national savings pool.
To enable investment to grow rapidly, either private savings must
increase or the necessary capital must be borrowed from abroad.
   Nonetheless, the decade of the 1980s has been characterized by
high savings and low spending in most industrial countries,
contrasted with low savings and high spending in the United States,
including that by the federal government. Such imbalances cannot be
sustained indefinitely.
   One result of these spending-savings imbalances has been
historically large trade deficits in the United States and
correspondingly large trade surpluses in a number of other
countries. Large trade deficits, like budget deficits, drain
domestic savings as more and more of the income produced in the
United States flows abroad. One factor causing trade deficits is
that American consumers like to buy foreign goods, including capital
equipment. American manufacturers should become more competitive and
regain the favor of the U.S. marketplace.
   Another objective is to increase investment relative to
consumption in the economy. One of the best ways to accomplish this
is to adopt the recommendation that the capital gains tax be sharply
cut. ...
   Recent data suggests that the industrialized countries are
becoming more capital intensive. The country that is the farthest
along in this process, Japan, has a rate of productivity growth that
is almost twice that of the United States with real income growth
also twice as high.
   Americans must significantly increase savings that, in turn, will
be used to finance capital investment. Clearly, one task is to
reduce the budget deficits and factors that result in the federal
government being a drain on the national saving pool, and to do so
without raising taxes. This should reduce the real cost of capital
and stimulate even more investment demand.
   The next step is to set a course for creating government
surpluses or at least inhibiting future government deficits while at
the same time not inhibiting economic growth. This will be a long
term process.
   Whatever the benefits of deficit reduction, the nation must not
expect that a balanced budget, or even government surpluses, will
solve all our economic problems.
   Comparing the economic performance of the key industrial
countries over the past 15 years does not suggest that countries
with the lowest budget deficits are those that necessarily grow the
fastest, have the lowest inflation, have the highest savings rates,
have the lowest real interest rates, or the lowest trade deficits.
   There are many other factors besides balanced budgets that could
contribute to economic growth. Rapidly changing technology and
products, newly productive economic centers, and increasingly
integrated world markets suggest that an economic policy driven by a
single goal is not appropriate.
   Economic policy should not only address the traditional concerns
about capital investment and productivity in the industrial sector,
but also such hard-to-measure items as productivity in service
industries and educated labor forces.
   The budget should and will be balanced over time. Indeed, the
administration's budget lays out one workable plan for eliminating
the deficit.
   There are other alternatives reflecting different priorities, but
with equal or greater spending restraint, that could balance the
budget by fiscal 1993, as required by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH),
without raising taxes. ...
   The National Economic Commission has been working on this project
for approximately 11 months. We have heard from 85 witnesses and
read over 1,300 responses from private citizens and groups. Our
mandate was to recommend ways to eliminate the budget deficit while
not impeding economic growth.
   It is clear that the president would prefer to coordinate this
activity with Congress on a one-to-one basis. Indeed, this is the
manner in which this process should proceed.
   We should continue to reduce the deficit as a percentage of GNP.
We support the position that the deficit can be resolved through
restraints on the growth of federal spending without increasing
taxes or affecting low income, means-tested benefits. Therefore, we
recommend restraining spending increases while keeping growth strong
as the mainstay of budget policy.
   With an estimated $82 billion in additional revenues in fiscal
year 1990, it is clear that we do not have to and should not raise
taxes but, rather, should restrain the rate of growth in federal
spending.
   The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit targets represent arbitrary but
appropriate goals for budget policy over the next several years.
These goals, if realized, will be attained without any new tax
measures and should result in a federal deficit that continues to
decline significantly and consistently. ...
   We believe budget process reform should be an integral part of
any deficit reduction plan. Any agreement on the budget should be
accompanied by process reform to rebuild public confidence in
national fiscal and monetary policy. ...

   The National Economic Commission was given the responsibility for
making specific, bipartisan recommendations regarding:
   _Methods to reduce the federal budget deficit while promoting
economic growth and encouraging saving and capital formation, and
   _A means of ensuring that the burden of achieving
deficit-reduction goals does not undermine economic growth and is
not borne disproportionately by any one economic group, social
group, region or state.
   Deficit reduction is a relatively short-term objective, in that
the goal is to achieve a balanced budget within five years.
Promoting economic growth implies a perspective that extends into
the 21st century.
   The realities of the political constraints faced by the
commission during the presidential election and transition period
left no serious possibility of carrying out the first responsibility
on a bipartisan basis.
   The Democratic members of the commission concluded, reluctantly
and sadly, that the Republican members' understandable desire to
support the new president's plan for achieving deficit reduction
precluded any likelihood of bipartisan agreement.
   The constraints he imposed and his flexible freeze plan are
plainly and simply inconsistent with ensuring that the burden of
deficit reduction does not fall disproportionately on any one
economic group, social group, region or state.
   The fact remains, however, that the majority of commissioners
believe that our national savings rate is too low and that
continuing large budget deficits and huge, seemingly intractable
trade deficits threaten the nation's long-term prospects for strong
economic growth. The views in Part II of our report are directed
toward these longer-run concerns.
   What is at stake is how we as a nation enter the 21st century. We
can either slouch into the next century, or we can march into it all
flags flying. Our future posture will depend upon whether, in
Hamilton's term, we get our ``political arithmetic'' in order in the
next five years.
   Getting our political arithmetic in order means achieving budget
balance by fiscal year 1993 _ anything earlier being wishful
thinking _ and moving into surpluses thereafter. The surplus goals
are readily identifiable; they should be approximately equal to the
combined surplus of the Social Security trust funds.
   There is no option in the sense of an alternative use for the
surpluses. The revenue stream to finance the surplus already exists
in the form of payroll taxes that are high enough to put the Social
Security system on a ``partially funded'' basis.
   If the present practice of using these surpluses to pay for
current consumption continues, the pressure to return to a
``pay-as-you-go'' basis will become irresistible, and the payroll
taxes will be returned to a ``pay-as-you-go'' level.
   On the other hand, if we can summon the political will to save
the surplus, we will transform our economy and secure our future
beyond any present expectations.

<TEXT>
   Maureen Reagan provides some insights into her
father, the former president, and unleashes a number of gossipy
barbs in her new book, ``First Father, First Daughter.''
   She writes that former deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver
``came to my father's administration not because he believed in
Ronald Reagan's conservative movement ... but because Reagan was a
politcal train that happened to be leaving the station, and Mike
Deaver wanted to be on board,'' USA Today reported Wednesday.
   Her opinion of former White House chief of staff Donald Regan is
no higher: ``He seemed to suffer from that rare snobbery of the
greedy rich.''
   She said Regan had his office remodeled to include an outdoor
patio like the president's, and kept referring to him as ``cousin''
until Reagan joked he would be accused of nepotism if Regan didn't
knock it off.
   The official publication date of ``First Father, First Daughter''
is April 3 but copies of the book will be in some stores near the
end of next week, Jennifer Kittredge, a spokeswoman for the
publisher, said Wednesday.
   Ms. Reagan says her father was afraid to fly but overcame his
fear during his first bid for governor of California. She also said
the president joked that would-be assassin John Hinckley ruined a
good suit.
   In her book, Ms. Reagan paints a picture of life in the White
House as a fairy tale come true.
   But writing about her own life, Ms. Reagan says that in her first
marriage, at age 20, she was an abused wife who ``just sat there
receiving his blows, not wanting to believe I'd let myself get into
a situation like this.''
   She said she never told her parents about the beatings.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The right wing scored a decisive victory in
Israel's municipal elections and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Wednesday the voters had vindicated his refusal to deal with the PLO.
   The elections Tuesday extended the power of his Likud bloc on the
local level and gave major gains to Jewish and Moslem
fundamentalists.
   Teddy Kollek, the moderate Labor Party's best-known mayor, won a
sixth term in Jerusalem but lost control of the City Council.
   A preliminary count gave religious parties 12 of the 31 council
seats, up from 10 in 1983. Kollek's One Jerusalem slate got 11 or 12
seats, down from 17; four went to Likud and three or four to the
secular Citizens Rights Movement.
   More seats on the council will give religious parties greater
power to enforce demands that restaurants and theaters close on the
Jewish sabbath, but Kollek said he won't make concessions that ``do
not conform to the will of the majority.''
   At stake in Tuesday's elections were 147 mayor's offices and city
councils. Labor won 54 in 1983, Likud 26 and the rest went to local
or religious parties.
   Final results are not expected until later in the week, but Labor
estimates it lost control of at least 10 towns councils, including
several in traditional strongholds. Most were taken by Likud,
including five of the largest cities.
   Likud has been a major national force for 12 years, but Labor has
been perceived as the establishment party because it controls such
grassroots organizations as the trade union federation.
   Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader, said on army radio
Wednesday: ``We have definitely been dealt a blow, and I don't want
to underestimate its force. But five years ago, when we won a big
victory in municipal elections, it didn't mean anything for the
Knesset (parliament) elections.''
   Shamir said the Likud bloc, a small opposition faction for nearly
three decades until it upset Labor in the 1977 national elections,
``is turning into a central party that holds the power.''
   He said in a TV interview the voters had declared their support
for his refusal to negotiate with the Palestine Libration
Organization or accept Palestinian demands for statehood.
   ``The results certainly strengthen me and the headlines of the
Israeli papers have already reached the world media and the United
States, and nobody can tell me I speak in the name of a small part
of the Israeli public,'' he said. ``They know I speak in the name of
the majority of the Israeli public.''
   Shamir is scheduled to visit Washington in April.
   Yitzhak Galnoor, a political scientist at Hebrew University in
Jerusalem, said Shamir's linkage of the Palestinian issue to local
politics was part of a strategy agaist mounting pressure to deal
with the PLO. In a recent poll, 54 percent of the Israelis
responding favored negotiations.
   In Tel Aviv, Mayor Shlomo Lahat of Likud won a fourth term on a
pro-secular platform and in Haifa, which has been a Labor
stronghold, Labor incumbent Arieh Gurel clung won narrowly.
   Voters in Akko, a mixed Jewish-Arab city that has become a symbol
of coexistence, rejected Deputy Mayor David Bar-Lev of Likud, who
said all Arab residents should be expelled.
   Moslem fundamentalists entered Arab elections for the first time,
scoring dramatic victories over left-wing parties. About 400,000 of
Israel's more than 750,000 Arab citizens were eligible to vote.
   The Islamic Movement swept Umm el Fahem, the second-largest Arab
city. Green Islamic flags flew over the city Wednesday and residents
drove through town in their cars, creating a huge traffic jam, AP
photographer Max Nash reported.
   Some Jewish leaders expressed concern about the victory by Moslem
fundamentalists, whose advocacy of one large Islamic state in the
region challenges Israel's right to exist.
   Arab analysts said the Islamic Movement won support by building
schools and clinics. ``It's not a matter of religion, it's a matter
of services,'' said Lufty Mashour, editor of the Arabic-language
newspaper Sinara in Nazareth.
   Noting the rise of Jewish fundamentalism, he said: ``If they are
worried about the Moslems, they should by worried about the
ultra-Orthodox. The Moslems are less dangerous than the
ultra-Orthodox.''

<HEAD>Mother Relieved That State Will Pay For Son's Bone Marrow Transplant</HEAD>

   A woman whose 6-year-old son needs a bone
marrow transplant said Wednesday she is glad the state will pay for
the operation but bitter about how the state handled the case.
   ``It's a big relief. I'm just sorry my family had to go through
this. No family should have to go through that,'' Vargas said in an
interview in her apartment as her son, Derek Annese, fidgeted on the
couch beside her.
   After the Boston Sunday Globe quoted New Hampshire officials as
saying the state would not cover most costs associated with the
operation, Derek's plight became the subject of radio talk shows and
led to a public campaign to raise money for the operation, expected
to cost about $150,000.
   On Tuesday, Gov. Judd Gregg held a news conference to assure that
Medicaid would cover most of the cost.
   Derek, who lives with his mother and two brothers on about $800 a
month in public assistance, needs the transplant to give him a
chance to beat a precursor of leukemia. A bone-marrow donor has been
located and doctors at the University of Wisconsin are scheduling
the transplant, Vargas said.
   The boy's mother said Wednesday she has not heard from state
officials, learning the news from a radio newscast when she and
Derek returned to New Hampshire on Tuesday from a trip to Disney
World. The trip was courtesy of the Make-A-Wish program for gravely
ill children.
   Gregg said at the news conference that the newspaper account was
incorrect, resulting from a ``communications breakdown,'' and that
the state's decision to pay for the transplant ``is not a new
policy.''
   However, Globe reporter Bob Hohler stood by his story and was
supported by Derek's lawyer and doctors.
   ``I don't see how it could be a misunderstanding,'' Vargas said.
``They (state officials) told Wisconsin no, they told my
pediatrician no and they told my doctor in Boston (at the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) no.''
   ``They weren't going to pay for anything to do with the
transplant,'' she said.
   Derek made it clear he was tired of answering reporters'
questions but said he felt ``great.''
   Vargas said Derek was excited that a path was now clear for the
operation. But she said he may only now be learning of the gravity
of his illness.
   After Derek left the room, Vargas said it was only Tuesday night,
as the family watched news programs that had been videotaped for
them during their absence, that the boy heard one of his doctors say
he would die without the operation.
   ``And me and my sister both just looked right at him at the same
time, because it was the first time that it was loud and clear, and
we just didn't know what he was going to do,'' she said.
   ``But he just sat in the chair quietly and watched the rest of
the (newscast), and he asked me if all those people were helping
him. And I said yes.''

   Allegations that at least two doctors during
the past year improperly prescribed drugs for Elizabeth Taylor have
prompted an investigation, but the actress is not a target, the
prosecutor's office said.
   The doctors could face criminal charges if proof is found for the
allegations that excessive amounts of various opiates, barbiturates
and stimulants were prescribed ``without medical justification,''
district attorney's office spokesman Al Albergate said Tuesday.
   He did not identify the drugs or the doctors, nor did he say what
prompted the investigation. Miss Taylor has not met with
authorities, he said.
   The actress, who turned 57 Monday, appeared at a ceremony last
week after a month-long seclusion and addressed rumors about her
health, saying she hurt her back in a fall on a movie set last
summer and it took a long time to heal.
   ``But I'm fine now,'' she said.
   The two-time Oscar winner did not issue any response to the
report of the investigation. Miss Taylor said in a 1987 magazine
interview that she had undergone treatment for addiction to
painkillers and alcohol.

   Former Gov. George C. Wallace,
chronically ill since a would-be assassin's bullet left him
paralyzed 17 years ago, has returned to his university post, his son
says.
   ``He is going into the office three or four times a week,'' State
Treasurer George C. Wallace Jr. said. ``We are very pleased about
his turn for the better.''
   The elder Wallace, 69, was bedridden for several months beginning
late last year and seldom left his Montgomery home, his son said.
   The four-time presidential candidate returned to work in the Troy
State University development office in February, but stayed home
again last week to recover from bedsores, his son said. He was
expected to return to work next week, but declined a request for a
telephone interview.
   After Wallace finished his fourth term as governor 23 months ago,
he went to work for his old college roommate, Troy State University
Chancellor Ralph Adams.
   ``Governor Wallace has been performing his duties,'' said
university spokesman Bill Buchannon. ``His duties are the type that
can be done in the office or at home.'' Buchannon said Wallace
raises money for the university and does some public relations work,
but he would not be more specific.

   Country-gospel singer-songwriter
Stuart Hamblen underwent successful surgery to remove a malignant
brain tumor but still suffers from inoperable cancers on his brain
and lungs, his publicist said.
   ``They had given him only two months to live if he didn't have
the operation and he would be in great pain,'' said Hamblen's
publicist, Garth Hintz. ``They certainly extended his lifetime
beyond what it would have been without the operation.''
   The 81-year-old writer-singer underwent surgery Tuesday at St.
John's Hospital in Santa Monica.
   Hamblen, who lives in Canyon Country with his wife of 52 years,
Suzy, was the host of ``The Cowboy Church,'' on radio for 12 years
in Los Angeles. The program is still heard in reruns in several
parts of the country, Hintz said.
   Since entering the hospital Hamblen has been contacted by such
well-wishers as former President Reagan, the Rev. Billy Graham, and
movie cowboys Gene Autry and Roy Rogers.
   Songs written by Hamblen include ``This Ole House,'' ``It Is No
Secret,'' ``Till Then'' and ``Remember Me, I'm The One Who Loves
You.''

   NBC sportscaster Dick Enberg, visiting his
hometown for the first time in decades, called himself a
middle-of-the-road broadcaster.
   Asked about Howard Cosell's propensity for controversy, Enberg
said: ``He did a lot for sportscasting. I am basically a vanilla
announcer, but at times you have to take a stand, and Howard opened
the door for that.''
   Enberg, a football announcer with NBC, was in this community of
1,300 in Michigan's Thumb to attend a benefit for The Armada
Educational Foundation, to which he donated $2,000 Monday night. The
foundation raises money for such items as computers and microscopes,
said schools Superintendent Elliot Burns.
   ``The winners in this world are people who have dreams,'' Enberg
told an audience of about 500 people. ``The losers are the people
who laugh at those with dreams.''

   It all started with a leather coat for
country singer and actor John Schneider.
   ``I put about $1,000 in the leather, and then I gave it to him.
It wasn't fit to sell,'' said Paula Blankenship, a clothing store
and a tanning salon operator who has become the leather outfitter of
celebrities including Tanya Tucker, Hank Williams Jr. and Louise
Mandrell.
   Blankenship's sideline began two years ago when she met ``Dukes
of Hazzard'' star Schneider in Kentucky. She was making leather
belts at the time, and he said he'd like to have a leather coat.
   She recalls that she was still learning how to sew with leather
when Tucker ordered an outfit needed right away for an album cover
photograph.
   ``She drove to Oneida. She got here three hours after I talked to
her on the phone,'' said Blankenship. ``We made the outfit right
there on the spot. She helped me.''
   Tucker arrived at 6 p.m. and left about midnight with the costume
over her arm, Blankenship said.

   If a guy changing a tire can so fascinate
motorists that freeway traffic is backed up for miles, imagine what
rubberneckers would make of 1,700 giant yellow roadside umbrellas
planted by the artist Christo.
   If all goes as planned, that's just what drivers traveling the
steep, winding section of Interstate 5 known as the Grapevine will
see: miles of octagonal umbrellas, each 28 feet in diameter.
   Christo plans the display as part of a two-nation spectacle for
three weeks in October 1991. He wants to set up 1,300 blue umbrellas
in rural Japan and says he will pay the project's $10 million to $12
million cost.
   ``The umbrella is something extremely familiar to everyone around
the world,'' the Bulgarian artist said. ``It's so enchanting, so
uplifting. It has a fabulous connotation. The umbrella is very much
linked to the greatness of kings.''
   The California Highway Patrol is diplomatically embracing the
project even while worrying about the effect on California's major
north-south highway a little more than an hour's drive north of
downtown Los Angeles.
   ``It will be a traffic nightmare,'' said Capt. Patrick
Harrington, ``but it will be a thing of absolute beauty. ... We're
really excited about it.''
   Christo previously gift-wrapped the Florida islands dotting
Biscayne Bay in hot pink woven polypropylene, drew a giant curtain
across a Colorado valley, and shrouded Paris' oldest bridge in
champagne-colored fabric.

   As Nebraska celebrated its 122nd birthday
Wednesday, the history-minded recalled an incident that could be
called the Great Seal Steal.
   Before Nebraska became a state on March 1, 1867, Omaha was the
territorial capital, and a lot of people there opposed the decision
to make Lincoln the state capital. So they kept secreted away the
60-pound state seal.
   When the new Capitol was ready for occupancy on Dec. 1, 1868,
according to previously published reports, then-Secretary of State
Tom Kennard declared: ``We'll have to steal the seal! There is no
other way.''
   Kennard hitched up his horses and set out for Omaha on a Sunday.
He entered the territorial Capitol, wrapped up the seal and stashed
it under the seat of his buggy.
   He whipped his horses into action and by nightfall had crossed
the Platte River, the line of demarcation between forces pushing
Omaha or Lincoln as the state capital.
   Early the next morning, he appeared on the steps of the new
Capitol. There, on Dec. 3, 1868, he put the impression of the
insignia from the state seal to a proclamation declaring the capital
of Nebraska as Lincoln, County of Lancaster, Nebraska, and that it
was ``open for business.''
   For 121 years, that same seal has been used almost daily for
hundreds of official governmental transactions. The seal depicts a
steamboat ascending the Missouri river, a smith with hammer and
anvil, a settler's cabin, sheaves of wheat and stalks of growing
corn, and the Rocky Mountains in the background.

   Thousands of mourners wept openly
Wednesday at a funeral for 38 Sinhalese men, women and children who
were shot and hacked to death by Tamil rebels this week, police said.
   The crowd of about 2,500 Sinhalese rice paddy farmers flocked to
Welikande, a remote jungle village about 100 miles northeast of
Colombo, to mourn victims of Monday night's massacre.
   They dispersed peacefully after the ceremony, a police official
said.
   The government led by President Ranasinghe Premadasa was
represented at the joint burial by Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne
and Defense Secretary General Sepala Attygalle, according to a
police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The victims were buried in graves in an abandoned rice paddy.
Funeral expenses, including the cost of coffins, were paid by the
government.
   ``Almost every home has hoisted white flags to mourn the deaths.
There is tension in the village, but police and soldiers are on
alert,'' the police sergeant said.
   The victims of the massacre were all from Sinhalese rice paddy
farming families. Most came to Welikande in the early 1980s as part
of a resettlement program after their homes were flooded by the
Mahaveli hydroelectric dam and irrigation project.
   The sergeant said that Tuesday night a child died of wounds
suffered in the attack, bringing the death toll to 38 _ 22 men, five
women and 11 children.
   Police Tuesday blamed the attack on the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, the most powerful of the Tamil guerrilla groups that
have been waging a separatist war against the Sinhalese majority
since 1983. More than 8,500 people have died since the insurrection
began.
   The Tigers denied taking part in the massacre, the third in
northeastern Sri Lanka in 16 days. At least 81 people died in
attacks on Sinhalese civilians.
   Welikande is in North Central Province near the border with
Eastern Province. North Central Province is predominantly Sinhalese,
while Eastern Province is about evenly divided among Sinhalese,
Tamils and Moslems.
   Tamil militants say the government has been settling Sinhalese in
the area to tilt the ethnic balance.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, account for 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and say they are discriminated against by
Sinhalese in jobs, education and the use of the Sinhalese language.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, make up 75 percent of the
population and dominate the government and military.

   John Tower made an extraordinary public
confession of marital infidelity today but vowed to keep fighting to
win confirmation as defense secretary by invoking the words of the
commander at the Alamo: ``I shall never surrender or retreat.''
   In an appearance at the National Press Club, Tower also said he
regards his weekend oath to quit drinking if he wins confirmation as
``sacred...and I can assure you I will abide by it.''
   Tower fielded questions about his confirmation ordeal as Vice
President Dan Quayle conceded the Bush admininistration is currently
short of the votes needed to ratify the appointment, and as Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell announced his opposition.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Bush was continuing to lobby senators personally in search of
additional votes.
   Asked whether he had ever broken his wedding vows, Tower, twice
divorced and now single, said, ``As a matter of fact, I have broken
wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone in that connection.''
   Tower's second wife, Lilla, alleged ``marital misconduct'' in
court filings in the couple's divorce case.
   Tower's appearance marked the latest turn in the struggle by the
Bush administration _ as well as the former Texas senator _ to
salvage the nomination against solid Democratic opposition in the
Senate.
   Tower has been struggling against concerns about his drinking
habits, allegations of womanizing and questions over possible
conflicts of interest stemming from his employment as a defense
industry consultant.
   In his remarks, Tower also turned aside a question of whether his
appointment was a political payoff for having headed a commission
that gave Bush a clean bill of health in the Iran-Contra scandal of
the Reagan administration. He said congressional investigators also
found nothing to implicate Bush, and said, ``I wonder what kind of
payoff they're going to get.''
   Tower showed flashes of humor and grit by turn at the press club
rostrum.
   Asked how he felt about his predicament, he said ``a little bit
like the fellow who was immersed in tar and feathers and was being
ridden out of town on a rail. He said, really gentlemen if it were
not for the honor I'd rather hitchhike.''
   Asked whether he would ask that his name be withdrawn from
nomination, he replied by quoting from the last letter written by
Lt. Col. William Barrett Travis, whom he identified as the leader of
the Texans who fought and died at the Alamo: ``I shall never
surrender or retreat.''
   Tower paused briefly and said, ``I am a little sorry I brought up
the Alamo analogy. It just occurred to me what happened at the Alamo
just 10 days after Travis wrote that letter.'' Texas defenders were
wiped out by Mexican Gen. Santa Anna's forces.
   Asked what had angered him most about his confirmation fight, he
said there were no clearly defined standards against which he was
being judged. He noted that several senators have said that the
secretary of defense, as the commander of U.S. military forces
behind only the president, must adhere to a higher standard. ``I
accept that...but my question is how much,'' he said.
   He then asked whether it is ``acceptable for members late in the
evening who had a few drinks in hideaways...to come onto the floor
late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear
deterrence,'' or to accept speaking fees, campaign contributions and
paid vacations ``from special interests who have a vested interest
in the legislative process.''
   There was no letup in the political storm surrounding the
nomination, as Fitzwater charged Democrats with turning the
appointment into a partisan struggle.
   The spokesman claimed some senators are ``starting to have second
thoughts about the words they used'' to describe Tower.
   Quayle claimed progress for the administration lobbying campaign,
as well.
   ``We don't have 50 votes yet. But we're moving in that direction,
and I'll be the 51st,'' he said, referring to his ability to cast a
tie-breaking vote in the Senate, where the Democrats hold a 55-45
advantage.
   Key Republicans said they would meet later in the day to decide
whether to seek a delay in the beginning of the debate on the
nomination, which has drawn widespread opposition from Democrats.
   Tower has been battling questions about his drinking habits,
allegations of womanizing and concerns about his acceptance of
thousands of dollars in defense consultants' fees, and Mitchell
addressed those issues in his speech ion the Senate.
   The Maine Democrat said he was troubled by Tower's work as a
defense consultant. ``He received payment while it was widely
assumed that he might be a nominee for defense secretary if
President Bush were elected,'' the Democratic leader said.
   Turning to the controversy over Tower's personal conduct,
Mitchell said ``it is not moral perfection or the qualifications of
senators that are at issue here.''
   ``Public officials have a right to a private life,'' he said.
``They do not have a right to engage publicly in behavior which
could interfere with the discharge of their public duties.''
   ``A single lapse in judgment _ or perhaps even a few _ should not
disqualify an individual from public service,'' Mitchell continued.
   ``But when the lapses in judgment form a pattern of many
incidents spanning many years, and when there is insufficient
evidence to demonstrate that the pattern has been broken, then there
are reasonable grounds to question whether the individual possesses
the qualities necessary for the uniquely demanding job of the
secretary of defense.''
   Mitchell's position was widely anticipated, particularly since
all Democrats who have expressed an opinion on the nomination have
opposed it, and almost all Republicans have endorsed it.
   But at the same time, the Democratic leader said he hoped the
Tower struggle would not have ``an adverse impact on relations''
between the Democratic majority in the Senate and the administration.
   ``I do not believe any senator's decision should be based upon
partisan considerations,'' he said. ``This is a personal decision
for each senator to make...''
   Quayle made his comments during a photo session with Guatemalan
President Vinicio Cerezo.
   Asked if Tower's nomination could still be salvaged, he said, ``I
think so. I hope so.''
   He said he was not worried about Pentagon operations, saying,
``The Pentagon is ongoing right now'' under acting Secretary William
H. Taft IV.
   ``There will not be any interruption until we get a new secretary
of defense,'' Quayle said.
   The White House vowed to fight on in Tower's behalf, and
Fitzwater said Bush would be meeting with ``one or two senators'' on
the question today.
   ``We're still hopeful. We're still going to keep working it ...
We'll just keep up the good fight and see how it goes,'' Fitzwater
said.
   The debate over Tower has become increasingly partisan in recent
days. Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, after a meeting with Bush
at the White House on Tuesday night, said the opposition ``is an
affront to the president of the United States who was elected last
November to make these nominations.''

   Hundreds of cooking professionals at a gastronomic
gathering this week concentrated on the chemistry of cooking and the
history of their craft, but they didn't neglect the savory stuff:
144 ways to prepare chocolate.
   Some seminars explored centuries-old techniques that are back in
vogue; others taught how to reconcile cooking methods of the past
with today's busy, hurried careerists. One answer: video shopping to
replace time-consuming trips to the supermarket.
   ``People still want Momma's cooking but they don't want to spend
time doing it,'' Louise Natenshon, a convention official and cooking
consultant, said Wednesday.
   ``History to High Tech,'' the 11th annual gathering of the
International Association of Cooking Professionals, joins chefs,
restaurant owners and food writers on a wide mix of subjects from
the gastronomy of grains to formulas for preparing chocolate.
   Convention participants will attend workshops on such topics as
``The Future of Food'' and ``Can Recipes Travel Through Time?''
   Seminars in Chinese cooking showed how the ancient method of
cooking food over smoldering tea leaves is still in style.
   ``Smoking and grilling are ancient technologies but they're also
the wave of the future,'' Natenshon said. ``They add a different
kind of flavor, like Cajun cooking.''
   Several participants said they came to ``network'' as well as to
learn about cooking.
   ``I think the most exciting thing is that people who like to eat
are people who like life,'' said Janeen Sarlin, a cooking teacher
who is one of nearly 400 participants in the convention that ends
Saturday. ``If I learn just one thing, some new way of doing
something this week, it'll be worth it.''
   The convention could get a little technical. For example, an
early workshop in ``High-Tech Tips for Fail-Safe Recipes'' was
clearly not for the kind of cook who relies on Hamburger Helper or
macaroni and cheese.
   Shirley Corriher, an Atlanta-based cooking instructor and food
consultant held a roomful of students in thrall for two hours as she
addressed common cooking problems. First, she distributed lecture
notes that included a section on the ``basics of emulsion.''
   ``There are 128 or more sugars found in caramel,'' she said,
while whipping up fish, chocolate sauce and a cake brioche. ``And
the big secret for flakiness is `cold, cold, cold.' ... You've got
to get chocolate up to 118 degrees but you can't get it over 120 or
it separates out.''
   But it's not all hard work.
   Participants sampled some of the goodies and will be allowed to
kick up their heels during ``Wine Tasting _ A Personal Sensory
Analysis,'' ``Ways With Walnuts,'' or the ``Fisherman's Feast,''
billed as the ``finale'' which includes a ``bounty of fish from the
North Atlantic.''
   Albert Kumin's ``Luxuriate in Chocolate'' was the most popular
workshop, according to convention spokeswoman Valerie Bergman.
Kumin, a renowned pastry chef and confectioner, designed menus for
the White House.
   Carol Cutler, the author of eight cookbooks, was one of 93
participants who signed up for Kumin's class.
   ``I like the master classes but it's really the networking that
many of us come for,'' she said. ``Like if I have some problem with
yeast, I feel a lot more comfortable calling someone across the
country to ask about it if I've already sat down with them here.''
   The convention borrowed heavily from its New England locale.
Workshops included ``Traditional New England Cookery,'' ``Boston
Baked Beans, Brown Bread and Beta-Carotene,'' and ``Beyond the
Boiled Lobster.''
   And finally, for pressure cooker enthusiasts, there will be a
celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Presto pressure cooker,
what National Presto Industries spokeswoman Shelia Sandy calls ``the

   The event will be duly marked during the convention with a

<HEAD>Top Republican In Albany Likes Cuomo's Shoreham Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Senate majority leader said
Wednesday he supports Gov. Mario Cuomo's plan to buy the Shoreham
nuclear power plant for $1 and dismantle it.
   Republican Ralph Marino, who could kill the Democratic governor's
plan, endorsed it at a Capitol news conference, saying, ``I think we
should get the issue behind us, at least have some kind of
direction, and this gives us stability.''
   Under the agreement announced Tuesday by Cuomo and the Long
Island Lighting Co., the state would buy the $5.4 billion nuclear
plant for $1 and have the state Power Authority dismantle it. The
never-used Long Island plant has waged licensing battles since its
completion in 1985 and nearly bankrupted the utility with cost
overruns and delays.
   As part of the Cuomo-Lilco agreement, approval is needed from the
Power Authority's board of directors. At the moment, Cuomo doesn't
have the three votes he needs from the five-member panel. Marino
could give Cuomo the votes.
   One of the slots on the panel is vacant and a second will be soon
because the current member's term is expiring. Of the remaining
three members, one supports Cuomo's plan, one opposes it and one has
taken no position.
   For months, Cuomo has had two nominees for the board pending
before the state Senate for confirmation. Last year, under the
leadership of then-Senate Majority Leader Warren Anderson, the
nominations stalled as Cuomo and the state Legislature battled over
the Shoreham issue.
   Anderson has since retired and been replaced by Marino. Marino
could free up the nominations, and both votes are expected to be
votes in favor of Cuomo's deal.

<HEAD>Commissioner Says Don't Make Social Security Separate Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Social Security Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy
urged a House panel Wednesday to reject legislation that would make
the Social Security Administration a separate agency rather than a
part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
   ``I firmly believe that making SSA an independent agency would
hinder our efforts to continue and improve our record of
high-quality service to the public,'' Ms. Hardy testified.
   ``What independent agency status would do is invite, and expose
SSA to, direct pressure from interest groups, states, and members of
Congress,'' she said.
   If such a measure were to win eventual congressional approval,
she argued, it at least should be changed to provide that the agency
be run by a single administrator rather than a three-member board as
spelled out in the bill under consideration.
   Although not taking a position at the hearing for or against the
basic concept of making Social Security a separate agency, the
General Accounting Office backed Hardy's call for avoiding a system
that could result in management by committee.
   ``As we have testified in the past, we believe a more effective
form of leadership would be a single administrator,'' said Joseph F.
Delfico, director of income security issues in GAO's human resources
division.
   The General Accounting Office is Congress' own watchdog agency,
and Delfico was careful not to offend Rep. Andy Jacobs, D-Ind.,
chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security and
lead author of the legislation.
   Delfico's reference to past testimony illustrated that attempts
to make the Social Security Administration a separate agency are not
new.
   The idea enjoys considerable popularity, particularly among House
members, because of what they say is a widely held public perception
that making the Social Security Administration an independent agency
would separate it from politics.
   Noting that he had been supporting such proposals for years, Rep.
J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, told the panel:
   ``Despite the steady increase in the financial strength of the
system ... too many people still doubt that the system will provide
them with meaningful benefits when it is their time to retire. This
is because, deep down, they do not believe that the `politicans and
bureaucrats' have the will to leave the program alone.''
   Making the Social Security Administration a separate agency would
not exempt it from following the policies laid down by Congress,
which sets both benefit levels and the withholding taxes to pay for
them.
   Pickle introduced a measure to separate the agency in the 98th
Congress and similar bills have been introduced in each Congress
since, including the current 101st. A bill passed the House 401-0 in
1986, but was not taken up in the Senate.
   Pickle noted that the measure has little overt opposition in
Congress but ``for some reason or another it always gets bottled up
before we get it out.''

<HEAD>Abandoned Plant May be Source of Disease at Trailer Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OCOEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health officials are offering free
inoculations to try to curb an outbreak of hepatitis believed caused
by sewage flowing into a trailer park from an abandoned plant.
   Fifteen people, mostly children, have gotten the disease at the
Palms Mobile Home Park in this Orlando suburb since November.
   Orange County health officials say the wastewater discharging
from the abandoned plant that once served the park is virtually
untreated and could contain the infectious hepatitis virus.
   Rain causes water to back up from the plant into yards and
streets, where children play in it, said Teresa Madden, whose
6-year-old daughter recently had hepatitis.
   Bob and Gina Segebart said Tuesday that sewage from the plant has
been a problem since they moved into the park of about 125 mobile
homes three years ago.
   ``It makes me mad, really mad,'' said Gina Segebart. ``I think
the entire neighborhood is upset.''
   Bill Toth, health department spokesman, said the shots of gamma
globulin will give residents temporary immunity and lessen symptoms,
which include fever, jaundice, an enlarged liver and intestinal
problems.
   ``Our prime concern right now is there is a very real risk of
transmission through raw sewage,'' Toth said. ``If we can break the
chain of infection anywhere along the way, we can stop this thing in
its tracks.''
   Joe Passiatore, an assistant county attorney, said a loophole in
state law allows a private utility owner to walk away from a
malfunctioning plant. The owner, Brevard County businessman Mike
Minton, said he abandoned the plant early in February after trying
to sell it to Ocoee and to a private utility company.
   He said he tried to buy more land to expand, but the owners would
not sell, and so he gave the county, city and regulatory agencies 90
days notice that he would abandon the utility. Under state law, the
county became responsible for having someone take over its operation.
   County commissioners Monday authorized repairs until a judge can
appoint someone to run the plant. A cleanup began on Tuesday.
   Something would have been done months ago if the mobile home park
was not in a poor section, said resident Doug Walker.
   ``It is like we are not here,'' Walker said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Asked for Help in Work-on-Sunday Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was urged Wednesday to grant
unemployment benefits to a man who says even though he is not a
member of an organized religious group his Christian beliefs dictate
he not work Sundays.
   David A. French, a lawyer for William Frazee of Peoria, Ill.,
said his client's right to freely exercise his religious beliefs was
violated by the state's denial of unemployment pay.
   ``The belief must be sincerely held and it must be rooted in
religion,'' said French. But he said once state officials accept
that a person's refusal to work Sundays fits those conditions it
does not matter whether the person belongs to an established
religious group or sect.
   The task for the justices, who are expected to decide the case by
July, may have been complicated Wednesday when Illinois officials
changed the state's approach to the dispute.
   The Illinois Department of Employment Security previously said
Frazee's basis for not working on Sundays must be more than an
individually held religious scruple. The belief must be based ``on
some tenets or dogma accepted by the individual of some church, sect
or denomination,'' the agency said.
   But on Wednesday, Illinois Solicitor General Robert J. Ruiz
argued that Frazee was denied unemployment benefits not because of
the absence of affiliation to a religious group but because his
belief was ``personal'' rather than religious.
   ``The sincerity of a personal belief is not the same as a
religious belief,'' Ruiz said. ``Just because someone sincerely
holds a belief doesn't make it religious.''
   ``Even if he says that it comes from God?'' asked Justice Antonin
Scalia in a tone of disbelief. ``It seems to me you are just
questioning if he was sincere.''
   The state's shift in position also was challenged by Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.
   ``I don't understand why you are making this argument,'' she
said, adding that the state should have been forthright and
``confessed error.''
   Justice Anthony Kennedy said the state now seems to be
encouraging the court to ``affirm a patently unconstitutional
ruling.''
   And Justice Thurgood Marshall said the state appeared to be
asking the court to decide that Frazee's beliefs were not sincerely
religious even though lower courts and state agencies had not
questioned Frazee's sincerity.
   Frazee was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits
after he turned down a temporary job assignment in 1984 that would
have required him to work Wednesdays through Sundays.
   He said as a Christian he believed non-emergency work on Sunday
is forbidden.
   A state appeals court ruled against Frazee. It said, ``The
injunction against Sunday labor must be found in a tenet or dogma of
an established religious sect. (Frazee) does not profess to be a
member of any such sect.''
   Ruiz made no attempt Wednesday to defend that reasoning. Instead,
he said Frazee failed to provide enough evidence that his refusal to
work Sundays was predicated on a sincerely held religious belief.
   ``This gentleman may have sincere beliefs,'' Ruiz said. ``But
there is not enough evidence to support it.''
   The Supreme Court has held three times previously that states may
not deny unemployment benefits to people who refuse work because of
religious scruples. But in all three cases the workers based their
claims on adherence to the teachings of an established religious
sect.
   Most recently, the court ruled in 1987 that Florida authorities
violated a Seventh-day Adventist's religious freedom by denying her
unemployment pay because she refused to work on Saturdays.

<TEXT>
   As you cruise down the freeway and chat on
your cellular telephone with your sweetheart, lawyer, bookie or
broker, bear in mind that somebody _ anybody _ could be listening.
   The fact that conversations on cellular telephones can be easily
pulled from the airwaves with inexpensive radio scanners upsets a
lot of people, including a few state legislators who have proposed a
measure to make eavesdropping illegal. Action on the bill has been
put off for a year while a legislative committee studies it.
   At a hearing Tuesday for the Committee on Energy and Utilities,
one cellular phone user urged action.
   ``If there's no prohibition against listening in, why not just go
to a CB?'' asked lobbyist Steve Duncan. ``The point for me is that
my phone is not like a CB radio. I'm paying more to the phone
company to use my car phone than to use a phone at my home.''
   Duncan is one of scores of Washington residents who use a
cellular phone, for which he pays $150 a month in subscriber charges.
   Attorney Deborah Senn, a legislative researcher, said either
technology must solve the problem or lawmakers must address it. She
said the problem will only grow along with the popularity of
cellular car phones, which now are estimated to number 1 million in
the United States.
   Senn said legislators have heard from lawyers and physicians who
are especially concerned at eavesdropping because some of their
conversations are with clients and considered privileged.
   ``We're talking about a lot of sensitive phone conversations
where people might not even be aware that somebody could be
listening in,'' she said.
   Duncan acknowledged that a state law might not stop
eavesdroppers, especially since a 1986 federal law, which carries a
$500 fine for eavesdropping, seems to have had little effect.
   But he said at least ``bragging rights would stop'' among
eavesdroppers who have been known to tape conversations and play
them on commercial radio stations for entertainment. He said he
heard just such a program recently on a Seattle station.
   Tom McBride, another researcher for the legislative committee,
said radio scanners with a megahertz band of 800 to 900 are capable
of picking up cellular telephone conversations. He said the cellular
phone industry is working on ways to scramble conversations with
relatively affordable technology.
   European systems already are secure against eavesdroppers,
McBride said.

   Police fired shots in the air and lobbed
tear-gas Wednesday at a rampaging mob protesting Salman Rushdie's
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' in the northern city of Srinagar, news
reports said.
   At least 35 people, including 15 policemen, were injured in the
clashes, United News of India said.
   Also on Wednesday, a Swiss newspaper quoted the son of the former
Iranian shah as saying that any harm to Islam from the book is small
compared to that caused by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death
sentence on Rushdie.
   Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark met with 25 ambassadors from
Islamic countries Wednesday in Ottawa in efforts to help end the
death threat. The ambassadors responded by calling on Canada to ban
the sale of Rushdie's book. No progress was reported.

   In London, about 1,000 of the world's leading writers challenged
Khomeini's death sentence on Rushdie by declaring themselves
involved in the publication of his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``We, the undersigned, insofar as we defend the right to freedom
of opinion and expression as embodied in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, declare that we are also involved in the
publication,'' said the statement.
   ``We are involved whether we approve of the contents of the book
or not,'' added the statement, whose signers included America's Saul
Bellow and Arthur Miller, Mexico's Carlos Fuentes, Soviet writer
Anatoly Rybakov, and Nadine Gordimer and Andre Brink of South Africa.
   The statement appeared to be the most high-powered pledge of
solidarity yet by writers with Rushdie and his publishers, and was a
response to Khomeini's Feb. 14 call.

   Indian-born Rushdie, a British citizen, has been in hiding for
two weeks since the Iranian spiritual leader sparked an
international furor by ordering him killed.
   On Feb. 12, police in Pakistan killed six anti-Rushdie
demonstrators. A day later, a man in northern India was killed in a
demonstration. The most violent protests took place in the western
Indian city of Bombay Feb. 24, when at least 10 people were killed
in clashes with police.
   In Srinagar on Wednesday, an organization of Moslem youths
demanded that shops and businesses close in Srinagar in protest of
the novel, news agencies said. Most shops, offices and businesses
stayed open, the UNI news agency said.
   Police opened fire after protesters began throwing stones, UNI
said. At least six of the 20 injured demonstrators were
hospitalized, UNI said. Authorities said 15 policemen also were
injured when they were pelted by stone-throwing protesters, UNI said.
   Srinigar is 400 miles north of New Delhi. India, Pakistan, Egypt
and South Africa are among countries that have banned the book.
   In Switzerland, the weekly newspaper Weltwoche quoted Reza
Pahlavi as saying the campaign against Rushdie was a calculated
effort by radical factions in Iran to keep the current leadership in
power and sabotage overtures to the West after the end of the
draining Iran-Iraq war.
   ``As big as the damage to Islam by Rushdie may be, it is small
compared to the damage Khomeini is causing,'' said Pahlevi, 28, who
lives in the Washington area with his wife. He is the son of the
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who left power for an interim government
that was toppled in the 1979 Iranian revolution.
   In related developments:
   _ French singer Veronique Sanson has withdrawn a pop song titled
``Allah'' from her repertoire following bomb threats to Paris
concert hall where she is performing. Ms. Sanson said her life and
those of her musicians was threatened by callers to the Olympia
music hall after her opening performance Tuesday.
   _ About 200 university students in the Malaysian capital of Kuala
Lumpur rallied Wednesday against the book, carrying banners with the
message ``Kill Salman Rushdie.'' The one-hour demonstration was
peaceful.
   _ The Swedish publisher Bonnier plan to advance the
Swedish-language release date of ``The Satanic Verses'' from autumn
to summer, the national news agency TT reported Wednesday.

   Construction spending rose a modest 0.4 percent
in January as work on non-residential buildings such as factories
and offices offset a downturn in activity on government projects,
the government said Wednesday.
   Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$424 billion in January, the Commerce Department said. January's
advance followed a a 2.1 percent increase in December and a 1.3
percent jump in November.
   January's strength in construction came in the non-residential
sector, where building activity rose 4.3 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $99.1 billion.
   Hotel and motel building was up 8.7 percent for the month,
factory construction rose 7.3 percent, construction of office
buildings was up 2.2 percent and work on religious facilities rose
11.1 percent.
   Analysts said activity in the industrial sector has been
bolstered as manufacturers expand capacity to meet rising demand
generated by strong export sales, although the pace of exports
slowed during the last quarter of 1988.
   ``We are moving into a phase in the investment cycle where we are
doing real capacity additions to our industrial base,'' said William
Dunkelberg, dean of the School of Business and Management at Temple
University. ``There's an investment boom that's still on in the
country.''
   Residential construction rose 1.1 percent to a seasonally
adjusted $204.6 billion, reflecting an unchanged pace of building
activity on single-family homes and a 3.7 percent gain in apartment
construction.
   Apartment construction generally has been sluggish recently, held
back by high vacancy rates and reduced tax incentives for investment
in such projects. The category had declined 0.9 percent in December.
   Michael Sumichrast, an economist and editor of a construction
newsletter, said building activity has fared surprisingly well
overall in recent months considering rising mortgage interest rates.
   But while non-residential construction is likely to remain strong
in 1989, the rising interest rates ``will make it virtually certain
that housing will start declining fairly rapidly'' this year,
Sumichrast said.
   Fixed-rate mortgages were averaging 10.78 percent last week
compared with 9.87 percent a year earlier, according to a survey by
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Government construction declined 4.9 percent to a seasonally
adjusted $81.7 billion in January. The largest category for
government construction, highways and streets, was down 10 percent.

   A growing number of Americans are filing
simpler tax forms, apparently because the new tax law reduced or
eliminated several beneficial deductions.
   The number filing the long Form 1040 is down 4.2 percent this
year, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday. The number filing
the ``short'' Form 1040A is up 7.5 percent; 6.8 percent more
taxpayers are filing the simplest form, 1040EZ, than at this time
last year.
   ``These figures suggest that many taxpayers who filed Form 1040
in the past may be switching to the simpler, shorter forms,'' the
IRS said.
   The 1986 tax overhaul eliminated deductions for state and local
sales taxes and two-earner couples, and began phasing out the
deduction for consumer interest. It also reduced writeoffs for
medical expenses, and for millions of workers it cut or eliminated
deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts.
   Through Feb. 24, halfway through the filing season, the IRS had
received 30.8 million returns _ only about 28 percent of the 109
million expected to file this year. That is up 2 percent from the
30.2 million at this time last year. This year's receipts included
13.1 million Forms 1040, 8.5 million 1040A and 9.1 million 1040EZ.
   The IRS had processed almost half the returns and had approved
refund checks for almost 8.3 million taxpayers, up 9in the Black
Hills of South Dakota.
   Partly cloudy skies and mild temperatures prevailed in the
Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11 below
zero at Warroad, Minn., to 85 degrees at Avon Park, Fla. The morning
low for the nation was minus 33 at Warroad.
   Thursday's forecast called for widespread rain from Oklahoma and
southeast Kansas across the lower half of the Mississippi, Ohio and
Tennessee valleys to the South Atlantic Coast states, with
thunderstorms heaviest over Georgia and Florida. Rain also was
expected from western Oregon across much of California and Nevada,
with snow from Washington and eastern Oregon across the northern
Rockies, parts of the northern Plains and the upper Mississippi
Valley, the Great Lakes and Pennsylvania, New York and Vermont.
   Highs should be in the single digits and teens from Montana
across the northern Plains to northern Michigan, with temperatures
in the 20s and 30s across Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, much of the Great
Lakes and Pennsylvania to New England. Highs should be in the 60s
and 70s over much of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, the
central Gulf Coast states and northern Florida, warming into the 80s
over southern Florida. Elsewhere, highs in the 50s and 60s should be
the rule.

   Here is a transcript of remarks by former Sen.
John Tower of Texas, President Bush's nominee for secretary of
defense, at the National Press Club on Wednesday.
   Thank you, Peter, for that very kind introduction.
   Ladies and gentlemen, it's a great inspiration to me to see that
there are so many people, particularly people in the mass media,
with such a profound and deep-seated interest in defense management
_ (laughter) _ which is what I will talk about today along with
strategic review.
   And I know you're hanging on the edges of your chairs to hear
what I have to say about those two particular issues.
   I think that this doesn't really look much like a lynch mob _
(laughter) _ but as the saying goes, we'll know more later _
(laughter).
   I'd like to speak to you today about problems of broad scope and
long-term significance.
   In short, I'd like to talk about the questions that normally
occupy the mind of a nominee for secretary of defense.
   It's clear that a majority of the American people lack confidence
in the way the Pentagon is managing their defense dollars.
   The president is extremely concerned about this attitude, and has
charged me with restoring public and congressional confidence by
renovating the Pentagon's massive management structure and
conducting a fresh review of our forces.
   The primary responsibility of the secretary of defense is to
ensure that our military forces are prepared, and the policies that
guide them will ensure the security of the nation.
   His advice to the president and his proposals to Congress need
not be popular, but they must be right, for in no other agency lies
the responsibility for the security of this country and the lives of
so many men and women serving voluntarily throughout the world.
   The overall military force we've planned for is not the force we
can afford.
   It is therefore imperative that the secretary of defense bring
out every ounce of efficiency he can find in the department and
ensure that fewer dollars are spent wisely.
   It really is as simple as that.
   Significant and painful cuts will be made _ cuts that are
prudent, yes; cuts that do not endanger our security, certainly;
cuts that reflect a thoroughly worked-out strategic design,
absolutely; but cuts that will create a storm of debate both inside
and outside the Pentagon.
   But then, we are prepared to face such storms.
   We all understand the budget crunch.
   The reductions President Bush and I have agreed upon are both
necessary and significant.
   We've already determined that in order to meet the Gramm-Rudman
target, $6.3 billion will be taken from the fiscal year 1990 budget.
   These cuts come on top of four straight years of defense decline
in which our military budget dropped 11 percent in real terms.
   We must make certain that in making these cuts efficiencies are
enhanced and our security is ensured.

   We should be proud of the significant and necessary resurgency of
our military power under Ronald Reagan.
   I make no apology for my support of that effort.
   And I look back with considerable satisfaction to the deep,
bipartisan support that helped America regain her credibility in the
eyes of the world.
   But the 1980s are behind us.
   We do not disparage the real achievements of the Reagan
administration when we note that the 1990s offer us some distinctive
different challenges and threats and that our response to new
situations will not be the fall back on old ideas.
   Now, that's why I've spent much of the past month in the midst of
two important initiatives mandated by President Bush.
   First, a comprehensive review of America's national defense
strategy.
   And second, the development of a plan for implementing sorely
needed reforms of Defense Department management and procurement
practices.
   Our review of the strategic options open to President Bush has
gone virtually unnoticed in the general clamor surrounding my
nomination.
   It has been in the works for many weeks, and it is a very serious
undertaking.
   Given the choices and the cuts that lie before us, it only makes
sense to begin the administration by stepping back from our current
situation to see the world as a whole and by assessing the trends of
uncertainties that will affect global politics in the 1990s and
beyond.
   Nothing would be more dangerous than to enter into an exhaustive
reworking of our budgets and programs without first attempting to
understand the threats and challenges that are likely to shape that
future world.
   Moreover, we cannot risk a dangerous mismatch between resources
and strategies.
   Our review will ensure that that does not happen.
   In assessing our strategy, we must first look at dominant trends.
   Some are encouraging.
   Our friends and allies have grown in economic strength and
self-confidence.
   The Soviet Union seems to be undergoing unprecedented reform and
has told us of a ``new thinking'' in foreign and military affairs.
   In Latin America and Asia, the forces of democracy and the free
market appear to be boldly on the march.
   But this is not the whole picture.
   The future of Secretary General Gorbachev's reforms is cloudy,
not only because their success is in doubt, but because we cannot be
certain what his reforms really mean for Soviet foreign policy until
we see more concrete action.
   Moreover, Libya and other hostile states are procuring evermore
lethal weapons that seriously threaten world peace.
   The sobering truth is that, even if the Soviets become less of a
threat, the world will remain a dangerous place indeed.
   The defense strategy review has several aspects.
   The review will analyze how current trends and uncertainties
affect the appropriateness and effectiveness of our national defense
strategy for the 1990s.
   It will identify those elements that should continue to guide our
strategy and those elements that should be re-examined.
   The review will address specific force posture issues in light of
the re-examined national defense strategy and current budget
constraints.
   The goal will be a military force that provides the most
effective deterrent while offering the greatest competitive leverage
for our defense investment.
   The review will examine how arms control can be used to enhance
our national security objectives.
   It will examine the basic premises underlying our approach to
current and prospective negotiations and ensure that they are
consistent with our defense strategy and force posture.

   The issues that we confront in this defense strategy review are
some of the most difficult in government.
   We face critical choices in both strategic and general purpose
forces, ICBM modernization, SDI, the manning and composition of our
land, air, and naval forces, and the mix of active and reserve
components.
   We must make sound judgments about what national security demands
and what budget constraints permit.
   We must also take a dispassionate look at our arms control
policies.
   As we all know, arms control is not a disembodied program, but
rather one vital element of national security policy.
   We must be clear on the role arms control should play.
   Arms control agreements must enhance the security of the United
States and her allies.
   In the Bush administration, arms reductions negotiations will
complement our overall strategic design, not the other way around.
   Of course, as we review our defense strategy and capabilities, we
must remember one critical point: Rebuilding our military strength
over the past eight years was critical to our foreign policy
successes.
   Maintaining that strength in the 1990s will be no less so.
   It would be shortsighted, indeed, to conclude that because we now
seem face-to-face _ or seem to face a more peaceful world, we can
neglect a critical reason for current stability: America's military
power.
   The planet still holds serious threats to the free world.
   While there are hopeful signs, there is still more promise than
performance.
   The challenge of our strategy review is to assess how, with
limited resources, we can preserve our strength and our alliances
and meet our commitments around the world.
   As our defense strategy review will mold the forces of the
decades ahead, so too will it frame the most immediate concern of
the secretary of defense, reforming the way the department does
business.
   I have said plainly and repeatedly before the Republican Platform
Committee in July of '88, during my time with the Bush campaign, in
my meetings with the president and his key advisers, and most
recently, in my testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee,
that the Defense Department must take a cold, hard look at its
management and procurement practices.
   This is something to which the president and I assign urgent
priority.
   At the president's direction, we are well into an extensive
management review of the department.
   Over two years ago, the Packard Commission reported on the ways
and means to reform our system of buying weapons.
   The president and I embrace the commission's recommendations and
they will be implemented with the utmost urgency that they require.
   Over the years, literally mountains of paper and seas of ink have
been given over to management reform reports.
   The Bush administration has no intention of adding yet another
hollow call for a change.
   The president wishes us to build on the best from the past, to
take account of current realities, and to give him by May a course
of action for fundamental reform.
   We will detail specific actions that need to be taken to
implement changes in four key areas: People and organization;
defense planning, acquisition practices and procedures; and
government-industry accountability.
   We know that our system for buying weapons is encumbered by too
many people and too many layers of bureaucracy.
   There must be cuts.
   We know that running the department demands a highly skilled and
professional military and civilian work force.
   Here, there must be improvements.
   We know that the system is choked by a thicket of laws and
unspeakably ponderous regulations which cost time and money.
   Congress and the administration must address the problem.

<TEXT>
   We know that there are buying practices and procedures,
identified by the Packard Commission and a host of other experts,
that can give us better weapon systems in less time and for less
money.
   We must make the bureaucracy dance to a different tune.
   Allegations of corruption and abuse are all too common fare.
   The public's trust in the Pentagon must be restored.
   It must be made crystal clear that we have zero tolerance of
abuses and abusers.
   The Department of Defense sometimes moves like an arthritic
turtle, and can find the most innovative ways to maintain business
as usual.
   That has got to stop.
   The defense bureaucracy can be reshaped, but only if people can
be mobilized into action.
   Leadership can energize the individual initiative of every man
and woman in the department and shift the course of events.
   In managing the department, subordinates must have the authority
and the backing to do their jobs effectively.
   They should be held strictly accountable for the results of their
decisions.
   The issue here, of course, is one of competence and integrity.
   These attributes are not lacking in the Pentagon, and they need
only to be tapped by an aggressive and hard-nosed secretary.
   The same high standard of accountability should extend to the
private sector as well.
   We cannot tolerate people in government or industry who fail in
their responsibilities to the men and women of our armed forces.
   Our military depends on nuts and bolts and sheet metal.
   We cannot be satisfied by anything but the best.
   Our attitude must be one of zero tolerance of abuses of the
system.
   The guilty will bear the full brunt of the law.
   These efforts cannot take second place in the secretary's mind.
   They must sit at the center of his desk.
   They must be his day-to-day concern.
   I have no illusions that the way the department should be handled
will make the secretary a universally loved individual.
   Popularity, as you may have gathered, has never been my strong
suit.
   But, perhaps that in itself should be a powerful recommendation.
   As some of you have suggested in your news reports, I've spent a
great deal of time thinking about what I might do as secretary of
defense.

   I've shared my philosophy with the president, now let me address
this larger audience.
   The secretary of defense is a profound responsibility in terms of
the global scope of his concerns.
   In a narrower sense, however, the secretary makes decisions that,
taken together, determine whether our nation has the wherewithal to
act when we must.
   Defense decisions can have no criterion save the preparedness of
our military forces.
   There can be no favorite weapons, only effective weapons.
   Each service must understand that the secretary of defense is a
person who can and frequently does say no.
   And under current conditions, ``no'' is a word that must slip
easily off the secretary's tongue.
   There can be no favorite contractor, only effective and honest
ones.
   Defense contractors by their performance earn the responsibility
_ yes, the responsibility _ to craft America's weapons.
   The secretary of defense must select and lead top-notch
subordinates to fulfill his mandate.
   Indicative of the leaders the Bush administration will recruit is
our candidate for deputy secretary, Donald Atwood.
   A proven General Motors leader with extensive engineering and
managerial experience, Mr. Atwood exemplifies the high standard we
will demand in our defense appointees.
   And let me note that one of the things that recommend Don Atwood
is his experience with the defense industry.
   In his position as in others, ignorance of the defense industry
is no virtue.
   Ultimately, however, the secretary of defense is in charge.
   He will be the person who must ensure that the president's vision
and sound principles are brought to bear in defense decisions.
   He must ensure that the hard choices are faced, the necessary
cuts are made, the necessary reforms are carried on.
   And he will accept responsibility for the results of his
stewardship.
   A secretary, of course, cannot escape controversy.
   But if he makes sound choices, Congress and the American people
will be the first to applaud.
   When billions had to be backed out of the defense budget, Frank
Carlucci decisively cut programs and force structure, and Congress
properly praised him for his doing business as usual.
   A ``business as usual'' secretary is not good enough.
   I want it said, ``Tower never flinched.''
   Major and expensive systems will not survive the defense strategy
review.
   I cannot give you a ``cut list'' of weapons because such cuts
should follow, not precede, our strategy review.

<HEAD>East Germans Say They're Turning Tanks into Farm Equipment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany will convert some tanks into farming
equipment and transport vehicles as part of plans to reduce its
armed forces, a government newspaper said Wednesday.
   The newspaper report also intensified East German pressure on
NATO to match a flurry of disarmament initiatives launched by the
Warsaw Pact.
   East Germany's Deputy Defense Minister, Gen. Fritz Streletz, was
quoted by the Neues Deutschland newspaper as saying the elimination
of 600 tanks would begin in May.
   Some will be scrapped while others will be converted to farm,
construction and coal-carrying vehicles, the newspaper said.
   Calling it a unilateral disarmament move, East Germany in January
announced plans to reduce the number of its troops by 10,000 _ or
about 6 percent _ by the end of next year, and muster out six tank
regiments as well as a fighter squadron.
   Streletz said 80,000 troops were being discharged by East
Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia. He said more
than 2,700 tanks and 800 warplanes would be eliminated by ``these
socialist brother countries.''
   The Soviets have also announced they are pulling out about 50,000
of their own troops from East bloc countries including East Germany.
   The East bloc initiatives have put tremendous pressure on the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization to come up with its own
disarmament proposals to match those of the Warsaw Pact.
   Streletz charged that NATO was ``continuing to hold onto its
aggressive concepts,'' Neues Deutschland reported.
   ``We hope these (Warsaw Pact measures) provide a stimulus for
other European countries to take their own steps toward decreasing
their military potential,'' he was quoted as saying.

   But in making those cuts, I will not succumb to the temptation of
stretchouts and postponing the tough decisions, nor will I assume
that any weapon or any force structure is sacrosanct.
   With clear policy direction and consistent oversight, the
personnel of the Defense Department should be given the chance to do
their jobs to the best of their ability.
   We have over 2 million willing, capable, and dedicated people in
the department who, if given the chance, can play a major role in
providing for a strong and fiscally sound national defense.
   I intend to give them that opportunity and to hold them, as I ask
you to hold me, accountable for the results.
   Thank you very much.
   I'll be delighted to respond to your questions.
   Q. Thank you very much, senator. We do have a few questions here.
I'd like to begin with one. Senator Mitchell of Maine this morning
announced his opposition to your nomination. The majority leader's
vote carries a great deal of weight. Can your nomination make it in
light of it?
   A. I believe that the majority leader also said that individual
senators should make up their own minds, or words to that effect.
   So, I don't believe that he's trying to put the hammer on anyone
_ or I would not guess that he is, based on statement that
individual senators should come to their own conclusions.
   Q. Senator Hollings this morning said you had made pledges to
abstain from alcohol before and broken them. Can we believe the
latest one?
   A. I don't know what Senator Hollings is referring to.
   I don't recall any such.
   But the fact is this is not a pledge, it is an oath that I have
taken _ have taken for, to, and before the American people.
   And I regard such oaths as sacred.
   And I can assure you I will abide by it.
   Q. You said Sunday you've never broken a pledge in your life.
Does this include wedding vows?
   A. As a matter of fact, I have broken wedding vows.
   I think I am probably not alone in that connection.
   Q. Senator, have you considered waiving the privacy provisions of
the FBI report so that portions of it could be released to the
public?
   A. It's not up to me to waive the privacy provisions.
   The privacy provisions, I think, apply essentially to the people
who were interviewed, and I don't think it's within the purview of
my power to waive anything.
   I have not seen the FBI report, I don't know what's in it and I
can't comment on _ really on _ or express any attitude on what
should be done with the report in terms of revealing sections of it
or all of it or a redacted version of it.
   I simply have no way of making a judgment.

<HEAD>Iberia Puts Losses Due to Mechanics Strike at $50 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iberia Airlines has lost $50 million in
business since Jan. 1 due to a three-month strike by jet mechanics
over training, pay and work benefits, the airline's president said
Wednesday.
   Iberia President Narcis Andreu also told Parliament's industry
committee the recent discovery of nine cases of sabotage of jets had
forced extra inspections and the cancellation of at least 10
transoceanic flights, costing $4.3 million.
   Andreu took pains, however, to avoid blaming the sabotage on the
1,600 members of the the Spanish Association of Aircraft Maintenance
Technicians who have carried out many one-day strikes since Dec. 23.
   Andreu also said it had 7.3 percent fewer passengers between Jan.
1 and Feb. 27, compared with the same period last year. He
attributed the drop to the 25 percent reduction in its 350 to 450
daily flights since January caused by the mechanics' strike.
   The union has pressured Iberia for a separate agreement to
guarantee training to meet international specifications out of fear
its members could lose their jobs in 1993 when the European Economic
Community creates a unified labor pool and establishes common labor
standards.
   The jet mechanics form part of a contract that includes the
company's 21,000 ground employees.
   Andreu said he would not agree to the mechanics' union demands
for a separate agreement because it would lead to calls by other
groups within the ground employees for separate agreements,
``increasing conflicts in negotiations and eventually reducing the
company's competitivity.''
   He said 100 of the unions' mechanics had been fired for failing
to meet minimum services decreed by the Transport Ministry on strike
days. Another 353 mechanics had been sanctioned for disciplinary
reasons, he said.

<HEAD>Iran Bans Imports of Cigarettes, Tobacco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has banned imports of cigarettes and
tobacco due to the high cost of imports and scarce foreign exchange,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said that details on the ban,
such as when it took effect, were not available, but reported that
the ban was announced by the State Tobacco Company during a one-day
seminar in the tobacco-growing town of Tirtash, in northern
Mazandaran province.
   It said that Iran imported 15,400 tons of tobacco and cigarettes
during 1985-86 at a cost of $124.4 million, mainly from Bulgaria and
Switzerland.
   But during a five-year period, starting in 1982, tobacco
production in Iran grew from 21,000 tons per year, to 24,000 tons,
the agency said.
   Iranians can purchase cigarettes with government-issued coupons
for $4.50 per pack, the agency reported. But in the flourishing
black market the better brands of locally made cigarettes cost as
much as the equivalent of $15 a pack.
   Smuggled, U.S.-made Winston cigarettes, fetch the premium price
of about $18 per pack.
   Soaring prices have forced many smokers to buy single cigarettes,
which are sold at roadsides by enterprising men who buy cigarette
coupons from non-smokers and sell single cigarettes to make a
greater profit.
   Last year, the joke among Iranian smokers was that if cigarette
prices rose any higher, they would find roadside kiosks selling
single puffs of cigarettes.

<HEAD>Government Criticized for Food-Poisoning Scare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A parliamentary committee criticized the government
Wednesday for its handling of a salmonella-in-eggs crisis triggered
by a junior minister's remark that most British egg production was
infected.
   The Agriculture Select Committee said ``the likelihood of an egg
being infected with salmonella is very small'' but cautioned that a
sharp rise in salmonella poisoning cases from 10,000 in 1981 to
23,000 in the first 10 months of 1988 was ``cause for concern.''
   Egg sales fell 60 percent after the junior health minister,
Edwina Currie, said Dec. 3 that most egg production was infected
with salmonella. Confronted by lawsuits from farmers, Mrs. Currie
resigned, but the affair prompted a major public debate about food
hygiene.
   The committee said the government, and not just Mrs. Currie, was
to blame from failing to correct her ``wrong'' remark.
   Critics have accused the government of siding with food
producers, neglecting the interests of consumers and issuing
conflicting statements that confused the public.
   Last month, the government ordered an inquiry into food safety
after warning pregnant women against eating soft cheeses and
ordering farmers to slaughter salmonella-infected chickens.
   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke said Wednesday the government had
issued health warnings ``that were very clear.''
   ``I accept that we have got to do more to tell people about the
safe handling of food,'' he told the BBC.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ``shares the concern of the rest
of the government that the health of the public is properly
protected and British farming produces high quality food and also
that ... we keep things in proportion,'' Clarke said.
   The committee said ``more should have been done sooner'' by the
government to prevent eggs entering the food chain from farms
responsible for poisoning outbreaks.
   It urged the government to spend more on research to counter food
poisoning, bring in better procedures for tracing outbreaks to their
source and reduce contamination in animal foodstuffs.
   The government's chief medical officer, Sir Donald Acheson, said
in January that salmonella in eggs is a serious health problem but
``only a very few eggs are infected.''

   Q. As head of the Tower Commission investigating the Iran-Contra
affair, you gave George Bush a clean bill of health. Some say your
nomination is a payoff for that and that's why he is sticking with
you in the face of strong opposition. Your comment?
   A. I think that when you consider the fact that the commission
was made up of three people, Brent Scowcroft and Ed Muskie in
addition to myself, that that would be sort of impugning the
integrity of Brent Scowcroft and Ed Muskie.
   I don't know whether the questioner intended to impugn them
because I had an equal voice with them on this report.
   We found nothing to implicate the vice president.
   I might add that the joint congressional committee found nothing
to implicate the vice president.
   I wonder what kind of payoff they're going to get.
   Q. One Washington columnist, Jack Germond, this morning on the
``Today'' program said you were not a cuddly or very well-liked
member of the Senate when you were there. Do you think that the lack
of affection of your former colleagues is playing an inordinate role
in your current crisis?
   A. Well, that would only be guesswork on my part.
   As a matter of fact, I have heard various commentators say that
some of my old colleagues had some scores to settle with me and were
prepared to settle those scores.
   I don't believe that's true.
   I believe it might be true that I'm not universally popular with
all of them, but I don't think that would be considered a motivation
for their vote for or against me because I have some very good
friends that hold me in deep affection and have told me so that are
not going to vote for my confirmation.
   I know of some in the Senate who have said that they have very
little affection for me who are going to vote for me.
   So, I would have to discount that as a factor.
   Q. Do you believe, as some apparently do, that the opposition to
you is mostly partisan? And please explain what you think the
Democrats would gain by opposing your nomination.
   A. I think it remains to be seen whether or not the opposition
turns out to be totally partisan.
   I hope that some of my Democrat friends who've expressed
privately to me that they feel I'm highly qualified and that they
see nothing that has come to light to date to disqualify me, will
vote for me.
   But I want to make an additional comment.
   I think if it turns out that way, that it's a significant
development in American politics.
   I think it raises the question: Is character assassination a
legitimate and acceptable means of the exercise of political power?
   If that question is answered in the affirmative, we have ushered
in a new and rather ugly phase in American politics.
   Q. Do you believe the Senate's decision then on your confirmation
will be essentially a political one _ President Bush vs. Senator
Nunn?

   James Sullivan and two buddies in a fishing
boat outraced thundering, 15-foot Pacific Ocean breakers to rescue
two people clinging to the hull of a capsized skiff.
   ``None of us was scared until we got back to the dock, and then
we just started shaking all over,'' the retired welder said
Wednesday after he and 18 others from 11 states and two Canadian
provinces were recognized as heroes by the Carnegie Hero Fund
Commission.
   Sullivan, 60, of Rockaway Beach, Ore., said the incident on
Nehalem Bay on Aug. 8, 1987, was the most dramatic of several
rescues he has performed in his life.
   ``We don't have to do it. It's just one of those things. You take
a chance,'' he said in a telephone interview from a dockside bait
shop. ``I don't know what it is. When you hear about someone
floating around and you have a chance to get them, you do it. To
save someone's life makes you feel good.''
   Sullivan, David Morrow, 41, and Lloyd Komlofske, Sr., 38, both of
Clackamas, Ore., were crabbing from their 21-foot boat when a
distress call came over their CB radio.
   ``We just dropped everything and said, `Let's go!' '' Sullivan
said.
   The skiff with five people aboard overturned in 15- to 20-foot
breakers two miles from shore. The rescuers, struggling to hold
their craft and maneuver in the breakers, managed to pull aboard
Stephanie Dennis, 43, and John Gochenour, 29, both of Portland.
   ``We went through a breaker about that time,'' said Morrow, the
skipper. ``It went right over top of us, and then I couldn't find
the people anymore. I was scared I was going to run over the people
who were still out in the water.''
   Morrow piloted the boat beyond the breakers, turned around and
was attempting a second pass at the skiff when a Coast Guard cutter
arrived for the other survivors. Morrow headed for shore.
   ``We had a big breaker coming up behind us, and you have to stay
ahead of them,'' Sullivan said. ``We had to outrun the last one.''
   The Coast Guard saved two people. The fifth drowned.
   The awards Wednesday bring to 7,313 the number of people honored
since industrialist Andrew Carnegie established the fund 85 years
ago. The latest recipients or their survivors shared grants totaling
$47,500.
   They are:

<HEAD>US Looking for `Concrete Steps' from PLO; Shamir Critical</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with official saying PLO supplied counterterrorism information,
inserting new grafs 7-9</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

   The State Department said Wednesday it would
keep talking to the Palestine Liberation Organization and look for
``concrete steps'' toward peace in the Middle East.
   The five U.S.-PLO meetings since December have been described by
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir as useless. And in an
interview with The Washington Times, he said Chairman Yasser Arafat
and Adolf Hitler ``belong to the same family of demagogues and
totalitarians.''
   The State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, declined to
respond directly to Shamir's statement about the U.S. dialogue with
the PLO. However, Redman said it was the ``basic approach and
objective (to) hopefully produce concrete steps that contribute to
peace in the Middle East.''
   At the last session, on Tuesday in Tunisia, U.S. Ambassador
Robert Pelletreau criticized a raid by three PLO guerrillas in
southern Lebanon, about a mile from Israel's border.
   However, Redman made it clear that the talks would be continued.
   ``This dialogue is not an end in itself,'' he said. And when
asked to assess the results so far, Redman said, ``This is still
early going in the process.''
   Meanwhile, Edward S. Walker, a deputy assistant secretary of
state, indicated to a House subcommittee Wednesday that the PLO had
provided useful information regarding counterterrorism.
   Asked by Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., about a statement two weeks
ago by the State Department's top counterterrorism official that the
PLO had not furnished information on the Pan American jetliner that
crashed after exploding over Scotland in December, Walker replied:
``I couldn't make that same statement today.''
   However, other U.S. officials, speaking on condition they not be
named, said the PLO had not provided information on that flight. One
said Walker did not mean to indicate the information concerned the
PLO flight.
   Shamir said in The Times interview published Wednesday that if
Arafat flew to Israel as the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat did
on a 1977 peace mission, ``we'd put him in prison.''
   Interviewed in Jerusalem by Arnaud de Borchgrave, the newspaper's
editor-in-chief, the Israeli leader called King Hussein of Jordan,
with whom he has offered to negotiate terms for an Arab-Israeli
settlement, an ``element of stability'' in the region.
   But, Shamir said, if a Palestinian state is to be established it
should be located on the East Bank of the Jordan River, where
Hussein's kingdom stands.
   ``If the Jordanian population one day decides to have a
Palestinian state there, it's up to them,'' he said.
   Although Jordan does not provide precise population figures it is
believed to be at least 70 percent Palestinian.
   The West Bank, meanwhile, which Jordan ruled from 1947 until the
territory was captured by Israel in the 1967 war, has nearly 1
million Palestinians and about 60,000 Jews.
   Shamir took a tough stand on these issues as the Bush
administration pondered its policy toward the Middle East. Israeli
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, who is also a hard-liner, is due here
for talks in two weeks with Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Arens also may see President Bush.
   Ending a 13-year ban, the United States opened a dialogue with
the PLO last December, over Israel's objections. There have been
five meetings so far in Tunisia, where the PLO maintains its
headquarters.
   Asked if the dialogue is a bad idea, Shamir said: ``I think it's
useless. Not healthy because it gives the PLO more prestige and
importance, and in such a way that it discourages moderate elements
who would like to find a path to real peace with Israel.''
   Shamir said there were many moderate elements among the
Palestinians. ``But when they see the Americans talking to the PLO,
they cannot muster the courage to do anything else,'' he said.
   The U.S. talks with the PLO were based on a judgment by the
Reagan administration that Arafat had renounced terrorism, accepted
Israel's right to exist and subscribed to U.N. Security Council
resolutions upholding the right of all states in the area to live
within secure borders.
   But Shamir did not detect any change in Arafat's attitude.
   ``History is replete with such phenomena who, after a while,
disappear when they have outlived their usefulness,'' he said.
``Take Hitler. There was a time in the 1930s when Hitler was
celebrated the world over as some kind of savior. The end we know.
But the price was a very heavy one.''
   Asked if he were drawing a parallel between Hitler and Arafat,
the Israeli leader replied: ``They belong to the same family of
demagogues and totalitarians, enemies of the Jewish people, men who
think nothing of killing millions to achieve their objectives.''

   A man who set his girlfriend on
fire when she told him their relationship was over was convicted of
attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years and 10 months in prison,
lawyers said Wednesday.
   Uilson Miyashiro was convicted Tuesday of attempted murder for
dousing Cristina Lopes Afonso with alcohol and setting a match to
her, defense lawyer Fabiana Jacobs said by telephone from Curitiba,
520 miles southwest of Rio.
   Miss Afonso, 24, who suffered burns over two-thirds of her body
and has extensive scars on her face and arms, testified that
Miyashiro, a 42-year-old opthamologist, went berserk when she told
him in 1986 their relationship was over, Jacobs said.
   Miyashiro broke furnishings in their apartment and poured alcohol
over Miss Afonso and asked her to reconsider, the lawyer said. When
she refused, he struck a match and set her afire.
   Miss Afonso spent four months in the hospital. She has had 24
plastic surgery operations and is still in physical therapy.
   Cheers broke out in court when the sentence was announced. Miss
Afonso's supporters had been worried that Miyashiro would receive a
light sentence.

<HEAD>WASHN: Senator Nunn.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. Again, I think we have to see this thing play out and make our
judgments subsequent to the way the debate develops and the outcome
of the vote.
   So I think it's perhaps a little bit early to comment on that.
   Q. Senator, what has angered you most about the way your
nomination is being considered?
   A. When so many of my colleagues have said that I was publicly
qualified _ or publicly said that I was qualified, and some
Democrats who voted against me in the Senate indicated that, early
on, they had intended to vote for me, and had complimented me on my
expertise, my background and experience, and my record of
leadership, that I suppose one thing that I think engenders some
resentment is the fact that there was no clearly defined standard
against which I should be judged.
   The standard seemed to be developed and seemed to evolve to fit
the situation.
   Now, several senators have said that the secretary of state must
adhere to a higher standard than members of the United States Senate.
   I accept that.
   I accept that the secretary of defense must adhere to a higher
standard than members of the United States Senate.
   But my question is, how much lower an acceptable standard is
there for members of the Senate?
   Is it an acceptable standard for senators late in the evening
who've had a few drinks in the hideaways and offices of the Capitol,
a few steps away from the Senate chamber, to come onto the floor
late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear deterrence?
   Is it an acceptable standard for senators to accept honoraria,
PAC contributions, and paid vacations from special interests who
have a vested interest in the legislative process?
   I think, in the course of formulating a standard for the
secretary of defense or indeed for any other Cabinet officer, that
it is time that the Congress articulated what its own standards are.
   Q. Would it be advantageous to your nomination for the Senate to
delay its vote?
   A. Well, that's a judgment that I can't make.
   There are some who say that an early vote might be to my
advantage, others that say that if it plays out for a little while
longer maybe the situation would change.
   I can't make that assessment now.
   I am not a prophet.
   And I've found that sometimes prophesizing is a dangerous
business, so I will not engage in it now.

<HEAD>Purists Move to `Copyright' Neapolitan Pizza for 100th Birthday</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf to CORRECT date to 1889, sted 1898.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One hundred years after a Naples chef
presented the queen of Italy with a patriotic pizza, purists and
politicians want to ``copyright'' the simple recipe for a genuine
Neapolitan pie.
   Representatives from the Italian Association for Real Pizza, the
Association of European Pizza Makers and the province of Naples met
Tuesday to define exactly what makes a ``Neapolitian pizza.''
   ``All over the world, pizza is sold and consumed but often it is
a product that has nothing in common with the original Neapolitan
one,'' said Gennero Ambrosio, industry commissioner for the Province
of Naples.
   ``It is, of course, impossible to `copyright' a recipe, but to
define the characteristic ingredients of real Neapolitan pizza is a
step toward keeping a pizza with mushrooms or hot dogs on it from
being called a Neapolitan pizza,'' he said.
   On June 11, 1889, a young Neapolitan pizza chef set out for the
royal palace on a mule with his wife and a sack of ingredients to
try out a new recipe on Queen Margherita di Savoia.
   The queen enjoyed the dish and asked the chef, Raffaele Esposito,
what it was called. ``It does not have a name, but from now on it
will be called as your majesty,'' he is said to have replied.
   Esposito had departed from the traditional pizza ingredients of
the times: garlic, oregano and sardines or dried cheese. He instead
used red tomato sauce, white mozzarella cheese and green basil, the
colors of the Italian flag.
   So impressed was the queen by this patriotic culinary invention
that she awarded Esposito a certificate of merit on display now at
the Naples pizzeria of Esposito's great-grandson, Vincenzo Brandi.
   Real Neapolitan pizza, according to backers, is made with all
fresh ingredients _ and, if possible, ones from the Naples area. The
thin, crispy layer of dough is made from flour, salt and water and
is baked in ovens fired only by wooden logs.
   The true kinds of Neapolitan pizza are the Margherita, and the
marinara, which uses olive oil, tomato paste, garlic and oregano.
   According to the Real Pizza Association, 432 million pizzas are
cooked each year in the more than 12,000 pizzerias in Italy.
   Debates, ceremonies and festivals are being planned for the
centennial this summer in Naples to honor the city's pizza.
   ``The 100th birthday of the Margherita is the perfect opportunity
to increase public interest in the purity of the product,'' Ambrosio
said.

<HEAD>Bush Panel Seeks More Ethics Enforcement Through Smaller Penalties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's ethics panel agreed Wednesday
that adding lesser penalties will increase enforcement of
conflict-of-interest laws, which now carry felony sentences.
   ``This is much needed,'' said former Attorney General Griffin
Bell, vice chairman of the panel. ``It takes a harshness out of the
law and makes the law much more effective. Now when you have a close
case, you just don't prosecute. You don't do anything.''
   The panel's draft report predicted, ``By providing alternative
prosecutorial tools that can be more carefully tailored to the
offense, these sanctions may expand the number of enforcement
actions.''
   With a series of decisions at its fifth meeting Wednesday, the
eight-member panel wrapped up all but the final drafting of a report
it hopes to give Bush late next week. Most of the recommendations
require approval by him and Congress.
   The laws which prohibit federal officials from using their office
for personal gain and which limit lobbying by former officials now
carry felony penalties of up to two years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   The panel recommended that these and several other conflict
statutes be given misdemeanor penalties and civil fines as well as
felony sentences.
   Misdemeanor penalties can range up to one year in prison and a
$100,000 fine. They said the civil fines should be the larger of
either a specific amount set by Congress or an amount equal to the
financial gain the official reaped by violating the law.
   Civil fines can be imposed on the basis of the preponderance of
the evidence. Criminal convictions require meeting the tougher
standard of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The panel said willful
violations should still be punished as felonies, but negligent or
inadvertent violations should carry the lesser penalties.
   R. James Woolsey, a lawyer and former undersecretary of the Navy,
said scientific and technical people considering whether to work for
government have ``worried that any violation of these laws makes
them a felon. It's far more reasonable if a mistake does not lead to
a felony.''
   The panel sidestepped the hardest decisions about what had become
its most divisive issue: moonlighting by judges, members of
Congress, top executive branch officials and top aides in all three
branches.
   The members agreed there should be a uniform limit on the outside
income earned by all top officials but called on Congress to set the
limit and to let the President exempt some activities, like
scholarly writing.
   Their compromise recommendation was that Congress limit outside
earned income to a fixed percentage of an official's salary. A
majority of the group favored a figure closer to the 15 percent
which now governs the executive branch rather than the higher
amounts allowed in Congress and the judiciary.
   The judiciary has no limit; the House limit is 30 percent of
salary; the Senate limit, 40 percent.
   The commission also proposed that Congress allow the president to
exempt income from categories of work that do not raise ethical
issues or interfere with the full performance of official duties.
This idea emerged after the commission tried but failed to agree on
a list of exemptions.
   Former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler suggested listing
teaching by judges, among others. But Bell, who wanted to exempt
royalties from books or inventions, objected to exempting teaching
by judges.
   ``When you get above 15 percent of salary for teaching, you're
not a fulltime government worker,'' Bell said. ``You're not in your
office when you're teaching and you need to be there so other judges
can talk to you.''
   Other recommendations approved Wednesday:
   _That political appointees should have to publicly disclose their
home mortgage loans and debts to relatives, assets worth more than
$1 million and income over $250,000. Those debts are now exempt from
disclosure. The highest asset disclosure category now is over
$250,000 and for income is over $100,000.
   _That a three-branch commission, modeled on the sentencing
commission recently upheld by the Supreme Court, try to standardize
ethics forms between the branches and issue advisory opinions on how
to fill them out.
   _That a panel of private citizens be recruited to give the
president non-public advice on questions involving the appearance of
a conflict of interest which go beyond formal interpretations of the
laws.
   _That the law authorizing independent counsels to investigate top
executive officials should apply to members of Congress as well _ if
the law is retained, an issue on which the panel took no position.
   _That Congress set up a joint ethics staff to give the House and
Senate uniform advice on ethical questions.

   Q. Senator, you've taken a beating in the press. Embarrassing
stories have been written about your personal life. What are your
feelings about this?
   A. Well, I can't say _ well, I guess I should say I feel a little
bit like the fellow that was _ had been immersed in tar and feathers
and was being ridden out of town on a rail.
   And, he said, ``Really, gentlemen, if it weren't for the honor,
I'd rather hitchhike.'' (Laughter.)
   Obviously, it has not been comfortable.
   I think that there has been too much of an eagerness on the part
of some aspects of the media to rush into print or on the airwaves
with unsustained allegations.
   And, there's an old saying, of course, that the answer never
catches up with the charge.
   The charge might be a four-column head above the fold on the
front page, and the answer, when it comes, refuting the charge or
rebutting it or disproving it might come back on page 23, somewhere
in the patent medicine ads.
   So, it's not a comfortable situation.
   And, I think my own impression is that I wish there could be more
balance.
   If I had to look at any single medium and say that that's an
example of balance, I would have to recant some earlier things that
I have said about that organization and say that I think that really
the standard for balance and fairness has been exhibited by the
Washington Post.
   Q. Under what set of circumstances would you withdraw your name
for consideration by the Senate?
   A. William Barret Travis, who was the commandant of the Alamo _
(laughter) _ incidentally, tomorrow is Texas Independence Day _
(laughter) _ and I will be glad to read Travis' last letter from the
Alamo to anyone who would like to assemble with me tomorrow and
listen to it.
   But Travis, in that last letter from the Alamo, said, ``I shall
never surrender or retreat.'' (Applause.)
   Wait a minute.
   I'm _ (laughter) _ I'm a little sorry I brought up the Alamo
analogy because _ (laughter) _ because it just occurred to me what
happened at the Alamo _ (laughter) _ just 10 days after Travis wrote
that letter. (Laughter.)
   But the ultimate outcome was a happy one, because Sam Houston was
able to withdraw his army to the side to sort of there pounce upon
the superior army of Santa Ana and defeat it in one of the great
decisive battles of the world. (Laughter, applause.)

   A gunman who entered a bank wearing a stocking mask
was shot Wednesday by an FBI agent who was inside investigating a
holdup that had occurred two weeks earlier, the FBI said.
   The unidentified agent was showing bank photographs of the first
robber to employees at an AmeriFirst Bank branch when a gunman
walked in, said William Gavin, agent in charge of the Miami office.
   The agent noticed the man was carrying a weapon similar to the
one used in a Feb. 13 holdup at the branch and watched as the man
demanded money from a teller.
   The agent ordered the robber to drop his weapon and shot him when
he refused, and the fleeing gunman dropped both the money and his
weapon as he ran outside.
   William Whitaker, 27, was taken into custody after he dropped to
the ground in the parking lot and faces a federal bank robbery
charge, officials said. He was listed in good condition at Jackson
Memorial Hospital.
   The FBI, Metro-Dade police and hospital officials refused to say
where Whitaker was wounded.
   The FBI is trying to determine if the two robberies were
committed by the same man, said spokesman Paul Miller.

<HEAD>Good News for U.S. Makers in Korean Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last year's settlement of a trade dispute with
South Korea cleared the way for rapid growth in U.S. sales of
cigarettes and leaf tobacco to that thriving Asian market, according
to an Agriculture Department report.
   ``Cigarette manufacturers have clearly won by gaining access to
this market, which earned them $56.4 million in 1988 and holds
promise for even greater annual earnings in the future,'' the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service said.
   Shipments of ``unmanufactured'' leaf tobacco to South Korea last
year were valued at less than $10 million, but that was the most
since U.S. leaf exports were about $40 million in 1981. The $56.4
million in cigarette shipments was the most ever.
   ``U.S. cigarettes have historically faced stringent trade
restrictions in this market,'' the report said. ``Prior to 1986, it
was illegal for Korean citizens even to possess foreign cigarettes.
This prohibition was lifted in 1986, but U.S. cigarettes continued
to face tought trade restrictions.''
   The restrictions led the U.S. Cigarette Export Association to
file a complaint with the U.S. trade representative on Jan. 1, 1988,
charging that South Korea had violated the U.S. Trade Act.
   Under the 1974 law, the president can take action, including
retaliation, to obtain the removal of any foreign barrier found to
be in violation of international agreement or discriminatory.
   Negotiations produced a ``record of understanding'' signed with
South Korea on May 27, 1988, which eased restrictions on U.S.
cigarettes carried out by the Korean Monopoly Corp., or KOMOCO.
   ``Now, U.S. cigarettes are not subject to an import quota,'' the
report said. ``Import and domestic taxes have been reduced further;
restrictions on advertising and promotion have been reduced; price
restrictions have been removed; and cigarettes can be distributed
independent of KOMOCO.''
   The report added, ``Soon after the agreement was signed, U.S.
manufacturers began to sign sales agreements with Korean firms, and
U.S. cigarette exports began to explode.''
   In June 1988, U.S. cigarette shipments to South Korea increased
30-fold from May. For the entire year, sales totaled 2.4 billion
cigarettes, or ``pieces,'' a 670 percent increase from 312 million
pieces in 1987.
   ``In recent years, (South Korean) cigarette consumption has
increased an average of 5 percent annually,'' the report said.
``Increased consumption is attributable to the tremendous growth in
personal income and increased consumption by women and students.''
   The report also credits KOMOCO with ``an aggressive promotion
campaign'' to help boost sales of domestic brands, many of which are
using greater amounts of U.S. tobacco leaf.

<HEAD>Officials Calls Releasing Rapist `Bad Decision'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the state's parole program
conceded that it was a mistake to release a twice-convicted child
molester who was arrested again this week on charges of abducting
and raping a young girl.
   ``We made a bad decision on this case, no question about it,''
Guy Revell, chairman of the Florida Parole and Probation Commission,
said Tuesday.
   Frank Potter, 43, was paroled by officials both in Florida and
New Jersey in 1987. He was arrested in Tampa on Monday and charged
with abducting and sexually assaulting a 7-year-old girl as she was
on her way to school three weeks earlier.
   Twice before, Potter was paroled after serving time for sexual
assaults on children in Palmetto, Fla., in 1968, and in Lakewood,
N.J., in 1976.
   In all, Potter had been sentenced to 55 years in prison in both
states and served fewer than 20 years.
   Revell said a probation officer recommended in a memo in July
that ``Potter needs to be in a more structured situation than
regular parole,'' and recommended community control with an
electronic monitoring device.
   Revell said it was only a matter of time before Potter's sentence
was to end. So the commission gave him parole on condition he attend
a treatment program.
   ``And it didn't work out,'' Revell said. ``We tried and the man
violated. We tried to protect the community as best we could through
some sort of formal treatment program.''

<HEAD>Speaker Says Report of Threats `Preposterous'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright condemned Wednesday as
``preposterous'' a published report that he had threatened to blow
the whistle on a Texas federal savings and loan regulator said to be
homosexual.
   The report in Wednesday's Washington Times said that Wright,
D-Texas, made the threat in an effort to get better treatment for
Texas savings and loan institutions whose officials had complained
to him, and that the issue had figured in the report of a special
outside counsel investigating charges against Wright for the House
ethics committee.
   ``The story ... is preposterous,'' Wright said in a statement
read to reporters at his daily news conference. ``This entire report
is antithetical to my personality. I don't threaten people.''
   The allegation that Wright improperly sought to influence S&amp;L
regulators is one of six allegations against the speaker that are
the subjects of a nine-month ethics probe. The ethics panel is
expected to announce some action in the case the week of March 13.
   Wright acknowledged expressing concerns in 1986 and 1987 about
regulatory conduct in Texas to Edwin Gray, then chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees savings and loan
institutions. But he said the exchange was ``consistent with the
work done by members of Congress all the time.''
   Wright said he had submitted to the ethics committee an affidavit
and a letter from two people present at meetings with Gray and other
S&amp;L regulators in 1986 and 1987 who contend he made no improper
requests of the officials.
   Wright did not respond directly when asked whether he had raised
with Gray the allegations of homosexuality, saying only that he
would not ``indulge in rumors.''
   Published reports and sources close to Wright say the speaker
expressed concerns at the time that a top FHLBB official in Texas
was pressuring state S&amp;L executives to hire the regulator's
homosexual associates as consultants and attorneys.

   President Daniel Ortega on Wednesday
warned critics of his austerity plan not to instigate protests
similiar to the unrest in Venezuela.
   Ortega said the opposition and the ``Yankee empire'' would be the
first victims of such an uprising.
   His speech came the day after the Sandinista government devalued
its currency and raised fuel prices for the sixth time this year. It
also followed days of front-page stories in Nicaraguan newspapers
about violent protests sparked by similar austerity measures.
   ``If a situation develops here like that of Venezuela, if workers
lose their heads and fall into the trap laid by right-wingers, if
they lose faith in the revolution, they will rob and raid the
establishments of right-wing businessmen,'' Ortega said.
   The leftist Sandinistas took power in a 1979 revolution that
ended decades of the pro-U.S. Somoza family dictatorship.
   ``If there is someone trying to sow uncertainty and instability
in this country it is the Yankee empire through its spokesmen,
(political) parties, radio stations, businessmen and newspapers, who
clumsily launch that campaign without realizing they would be the
first victims of the wave they're trying to stimulate,'' Ortega said
in a speech opening the new semester at a local high school.
   The president blamed the United States and other industrialized
nations for the economic crises in Nicaragua and Venezuela.
   He said: ``In Nicaragua, right-wing groups, politicians and radio
stations speak against the economic measures, of the disaster of the
Nicaraguan situation,'' Ortega said.
   He called it the tolling of ``a bell calling the people to
insurrection.''
   ``They fail to understand that with these attitudes they are
playing with fire, which could end up burning them,'' he said.
   The riots in Venezuela came after the month-old government of
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez announced a sweeping
economic reform package under pressure from internatonal creditors.
   Although Nicaragua does not face the same pressure from
creditors, it is suffering from inflation that hit 20,000 percent
last year and Ortega's harsh austerity program resembles Venezuela's
in many ways.
   The Sandinista program, announced Jan. 30, includes devaluations,
cuts in public spending, higher fuel prices, massive layoffs of
public employees, restricting credit and slashing capital investment.
   ``Our country demands effort, sacrifice and productivity from all
Nicaraguans,'' Ortega said Wednesday.
   He said his economic program is working and that inflation, which
hit 97 percent in January alone was ``only 40 or 41 percent'' in
February.
   ``We were expecting a much higher inflation rate, but our
measures are showing results, thanks to the efforts of the popular
sectors and of responsible businessmen,'' he said.
   Nicaragua's currency, the cordoba, has been devalued six times so
far this year. Each time the cost of food and fuel has risen, in
part because food has to be trucked into the city from the
countryside.
   The latest devaluation was announced Wednesday, with the official
exchange rate now 4,200 cordobas to the U.S. dollar, up from 3,800
cordobas.
   Fuel prices also rose 1,000 cordobas, with a gallon of gasoline
now selling for 8,900 cordobas. Ortega said that fuel prices will
rise in the future but not by as much as over the last two months.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday directed a Pentagon
review of ``management practices throughout the department.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the review would
build on 1986 recommendations of a commission on defense management
appointed by former President Reagan.
   That commission, headed by industrialist David Packard, called
for a major overhaul of the military procurement system, claiming
weapons systems take too long to bring on-line, cost too much and
often do not perform as promised.
   ``The focus now is to identify specific actions to address
problems already clearly identified,'' Fitzwater said in a statement.
   It was not immediately clear from the White House's announcement
what Bush expected from the new review. Last Dec. 13, in a status
report provided to journalists, Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said
34 of the commission's 37 recommendations ``have already been
implemented or are now in the process of being implemented.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush's determination to stick by John
Tower in his messy struggle for confirmation demonstrates a
remarkable premium on personal loyalty and a stubborn belief that a
president is entitled to have the people he wants in his Cabinet.
   Despite allegations against Tower of excessive drinking,
womanizing and conflict of interest with Pentagon contractors, Bush
has never wavered in his support for his fellow Texan and longtime
friend to run the Defense Department.
   ``I've made my call,'' Bush said Wednesday. ``I've looked at the
record. I've known this man since 1959 and my support is
unequivocal. John Tower is in my view the best man for this job.''
   Thus, at the risk of a damaging political loss, Bush is heading
for a Senate showdown that he easily could lose. The episode
threatens to sour a honeymoon with Congress that already has been
strained by wrangling over the budget.
   The White House says the battle is stained by partisanship. But
with the Democrats holding a 55-45 edge in the Senate, a partisan
fight is the last kind of test Bush should want.
   It promises to get ugly, with Democrats and Republicans trading
sharp charges and insults.
   ``Strategically, this is the worst thing that could happen to
Bush. The longer this goes on, the more people are going to say
things they're going to regret,'' said Stephen Hess, a specialist in
the presidency at the Brookings Institution.
   ``A new president should try to engineer an early, decisive
victory when people are really noticing. He should do something he
wins,'' Hess said. ``It's almost as if George Bush has engineered a
defeat.''
   White House deputy chief of staff Andrew Card said Bush
``believes the president should have the right to put people in the
Cabinet ... unless it could be shown without any question that they
are not qualified.''
   In a statement aimed squarely at the Senate, Bush said, ``Look,
do what you've got to do but remember fair play, remember decency
and honor and then remember also historically the concept of advise
and consent, where reasonable doubt is given historically to the
president of the United States, who, after all, is responsible for
the executive branch of this government.''
   Over the past 200 years, only eight Cabinet nominees have been
rejected by the Senate and never in the first stages of a presidency.
   After examining FBI reports, Bush refuses to believe any of the
charges against Tower and argues that it's wrong for anyone to be
judged by rumors and innuendo.
   ``The president has known John Tower longer than anyone in the
United States Senate has known him,'' said Phil Trulock, the
Heritage Foundation vice president who was among a group of
conservatives that met with Bush on Wednesday. ``He knows, probably
better than anyone, the senator's short-fallings and his strengths.''
   Bush and Tower have a long history of political favors. Back in
1960, Bush was the Harris County chairman for Tower's first race for
the Senate.
   More recently, at the drop of a hat, Tower packed his bags during
the presidential race to campaign alongside Bush, particularly in
the big battleground state of Texas.
   When people were drawing up the names for a defense secretary
under Bush, Tower's name was always first.
   Washington's rumor mill has also buzzed with unproven speculation
that Tower's appointment was a political payoff for having headed a
commission that essentially cleared Bush of any significant role in
the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reagan administration.
   Tower brushed that idea aside Wednesday, saying congressional
investigators also found nothing to implicate Bush.
   ``I wonder what kind of payoff they're going to get,'' Tower
asked.
   Whatever the outcome, Bush has tried to limit the political
damage by refusing to be drawn into a name-calling, finger-pointing
fight with his Democratic opponents.
   ``The one good thing about the president is that he understands
politics and he knows that most people don't hold grudges and can
move from one issue to the next without a lot of bias,'' said Card.

   Communities should be allowed to protect
younger teen-agers by banning anyone over 18 from dance halls that
cater to minors, the Supreme Court was told Wednesday.
   ``Dallas is attacking the juvenile crime problem ... and the
influence older people can have on juveniles,'' Craig Lee Hopkins
argued in urging reinstatement of the Texas city's age limits for
patronizing certain types of dance halls.
   Hopkins said local governments do not infringe on people's right
to associate with whom they please by imposing such bans.
   There is ``no constitutional right of association reaching a
dance hall,'' he said. Even if there were such a right, Hopkins
added, the Dallas ordinance still served the compelling interest of
protecting younger teen-agers.
   But lawyer Daniel Sheehan Jr., representing a Dallas dance hall
owner, said, ``We are asking the court to recognize the right ... to
associate even if the purpose is social.''
   Although the word ``association'' does not appear in the
Constitution, a long series of Supreme Court decisions have
recognized such a right _ including political and familial
associations.
   But the court has never said that such constitutional protection
extends to ``social'' or recreational associations as well.
   A Texas appeals court recognized such a right in 1987, when it
struck down the Dallas ordinance that licensed certain dance halls
on the condition only teens aged 14 to 18 be admitted as patrons.
   The ordinance made exceptions for parents, legal guardians and
dance hall employees.
   The city appealed to the nation's highest court; a decision is
expected by July.
   All nine justices asked questions during a lively, hour-long
argument session Wednesday.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Sandra Day O'Connor seemed most impressed by Hopkins' arguments
that, even if 14-year-olds have a right to associate with people
older than 18, the city may create a ``safe harbor'' by inhibiting
that right in dance halls.
   At one point, a seemingly dubious Rehnquist asked Sheehan why the
dance hall age limits are any less constitutional than statutory
rape laws making it a crime to have sex with a minor.
   The Dallas ordinance was challenged successfully in state courts
by Charles M. Stanglin, who operates the Twilight Skating Rink.
   Stanglin has a ``Class E'' dance hall license, issued to those
dance halls catering to minors.
   He divided the floor of his skating rink so that patrons dance or
skate to the same music in full view of one another. People over 18
can be admitted to the skating rink but not to the dance hall.
   Contending that the ordinance may betray many Dallas residents'
religiously based bias against dancing, Sheehan asked, ``If the
problem is older teens corrupting younger teens, why (are they only
barred) on a dance floor?''
   Scalia, smiling broadly, suggested that the city ``may be moving
on roller rinks next _ one evil at a time.''
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun voiced surprise when the city's lawyer
said about 500 dance halls hold licenses.
   ``Do they do anything else in Dallas?'' Blackmun asked.
   The case is Dallas vs. Stanglin, 87-1848.

<HEAD>Commission Members Defend Base Closing Plans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Members of a presidential panel Wednesday
defended their plan to close U.S. military bases, telling lawmakers
the decisions were based on ``military value.''
   The commission's co-chairs, former Sen. Abraham Ribicoff,
D-Conn., and former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala., also disputed
lawmakers' claims that the decisions were based on faulty data or
conclusions.
   Ribicoff and Edwards, testifying before the House Subcommittee on
Military Installations and Facilities, defended the Dec. 30 report
of the Commission on Base Realignment and Closure.
   ``We did not just pluck these recommendations out of midair,''
Ribicoff said.
   Disputing charges that the commission played politics, Edwards
added, ``Military value is really the touchstone of the process.''
   Ribicoff and Edwards were supported by a top congressional
investigator, who said he has yet to find ``glaring errors'' in the
commission's data.
   Edwards and Ribicoff were on Capitol Hill to fend off criticism
of their report, which was proposed by Congress in an attempt to
solve the politically difficult problem of closing military bases.
   The base-closing panel, planning to close some 86 installations
and partially shut five others, expects its recommendations to save
$5.6 billion over 20 years.
   Congress is scheduled to vote within weeks on the
recommendations, which must be either endorsed in whole or refused
in whole.
   Most criticism has come from lawmakers facing base closings in
their areas. Some lawmakers say the decisions are based on bad
conclusions, and that transfer of some doomed bases' functions will
cost as much or more money than they will save.
   Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., said he orginally supported the
legislation calling for the commission's report. But Hopkins said he
has been concerned by calculations that show the closures might not
save money.
   ``If we're not, I'm not going to support it,'' he said.
   For example, the commission estimates reductions at Fort Dix,
N.J., will save $84.5 million a year. A report by the Secretary of
Defense's office predicts the change will cost $190 million in new
military construction, and $182 million in other ``implementation''
costs.
   Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Robert Stone, who provided the
cost estimates, defended them.
   ``There is an old adage that it takes money to make money. For
base closures, it takes money to save money,'' Stone told the
subcommittee.
   Ribicoff said the commission made its recommendations ``after
serious consideration.'' Criticism was expected, he said. ``Change
is not always welcomed. In fact, it can be threatening.''
   ``We were heartened by the substantial evidence showing that
communities do recover from the temporary dislocations that result
from a base closing. Many end up much better off,'' Ribicoff said.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., the subcommittee chairwoman,
asked Edwards about speculation some of the decisions may have been
motivated by politics.
   ``We were not only bipartisan. We were non-partisan,'' Edwards
replied.
   Frank Conahan, a ranking official of Congress' General Accounting
Office, said his agency has yet to find fault with the commission's
overall recommendations.
   ``We have not found any glaring errors,'' said Conahan, adding
the GAO's review will continue.

   A. I have already outlined some of the terms of reference for our
internal management reforms.
   Rather than try to go into detail with you because that's
currently under development, I think I should simply say that we
look forward to full implementation of the Packard Commission report
_ the Packard Commission recommendations, doing all that we can
administratively, and then at the point where we have done all that
we can administratively, go to Congress and ask for congressional
help and whatever statutory relief _ statutory changes _ that are
required to reduce the overlayered bureaucracy in the
micro-management that now exists and the maze of statutes and
regulations that are often in conflict with themselves.
   I think what is indicated probably is a recodification of all of
our procurement statutes.
   Q. Would you comment on the state of the current relationship
between the department and the defense supply industry. Should it be
improved? And how would you do that, especially in view of your own
personal perceived conflict of interest by some?
   A. Well, in terms of my own case, that's a perception of an
appearence.
   There is none because I have no continuing financial arrangement
with any defense contractor.
   I severed all my relationships with them as of the first of
December of last year, three months ago.
   And so, I have no continuing financial interests.
   I have no particular loyalty to any particular contractor.
   I think contractors must be held accountable for what they are
responsible for.
   And I believe that we should insist on value for the dollar that
we spend with them.
   And I think we should insist that they be honest in their
dealings with the Defense Department.
   And I believe that it's high time that they undertook a
substantial policing of their own industry and embarked on a
self-improvement program.
   And I think if that is not successful, then we have to impose
certain disciplines on the contractors ourselves.
   Q. What is your view of proposals to use certain elements of the
armed forces in the program to interdict drug shipments into this
country?
   A. I believe that we should use them as effectively as possible.
   I think that unfortunately there are a lot of misconceptions
about how effectively military assets can be used in interdicting
the drug traffic.
   Some have gone so far as to suggest that we take the entire force
of the United States Army that is currently based in the United
States and deployed along the border.
   I don't think that would be an effective means of the use of the
military.

<TEXT>
   Politicians and right-wing activists have
formed an organization promoting the re-election of military
President Augusto Pinochet, who was lost a referendum last year on
whether he should remain in office.
   Claudio Morales, a former councilman in Valparaiso, said the
group is made up of social leaders, independent politicians and
members of various right-wing parties who are ``convinced that the
best candidate we may have'' is Pinochet.
   The group was organized Tuesday night in Valparaiso, 75 miles
north west of Santiago.
   Several right-wing politicians and parties have also indicated
they would like Pinochet to run, but the Valparaiso group is the
first one especially organized to promote his candidacy.
   The 1980 constitution bars Pinochet from seeking re-election, but
in recent weeks the growing divisions among right-wing forces
prompted calls to find a way for him to run in the Dec. 14 election.
   The election was made mandatory by an Oct. 5 referendum, in which
voters overwhelmingly rejected a military proposal to extend
Pinochet's term until 1997.
   Supporters of a Pinochet candidacy say the constitution may be
changed to allow him to run, and the general's wife, Lucia Hiriart,
publicly supported such a constitutional amendment.
   Others say the constitutional restriction on re-election does not
apply to the 73-year-old president and army commander because he was
not elected in the first place. Pinochet seized power in a bloody
1973 coup.
   The government announced last week that it is considering a
plebiscite as early as June to approve unspecified constitutional
changes. There has been no indication, however, that the changes
would include one to allow Pinochet to run in December.
   Pablo Rodriguez, one of two right-wing politicians who have
formally announced their presidential candidacies, says he would
only withdraw from the race if Pinochet can run.
   Pinochet has admitted he cannot be a candidate under the present
constitutional terms. He told his supporters, however, that he will
tell them who to support in the presidential race.

   Jubilant Icelanders quaffed legal lager
for the first time in 74 years Wednesday when prohibition laws
banning the sale of full-strength beer officially ended.
   Lines formed outside some of the 17 state liquor stores that hold
the monopoly on selling spirits. When the doors swung open at the
Snorra Braut branch in central Reykjavik, there were cheers and
applause.
   Two new pubs timed their opening day to coincide with ``B-Day,''
and many restaurants and bars reported their tables were booked up
weeks in advance by Icelanders planning to celebrate their new
freedom.
   In one new pub in Reykjavik, The Beer Cellar, a bell was rung at
noon and customers were asked to observe a moment of silence before
taking a gulp.
   Alcoholic drinks became illegal in Iceland in 1915 following a
referendum, and although prohibition was repealed in 1933, beer
containing more than 2.25 percent alcohol remained outlawed.
   The weak beer never gained popularity, and Icelanders who wanted
to imbibe legally often resorted to the national drink called the
Black Death, a mind-numbing, clear liquid that is 40 percent alcohol
and tastes like vodka.
   Parliament finally passed a law legalizing beer in May, and gave
the island nation of 251,000 until March 1 to prepare for the change
that ended Iceland's isolation from its ale-loving Scandinavian
neighbors.
   After the moment of silence at The Beer Cellar on Wednesday,
Magnus Sveinsson, president of the Reykjavik City Council, cut a
ribbon and enjoyed the first glass of locally brewed suds. Each
customer got a free glass of beer _no mean feat, considering that
bars are charging $3.90 to $4.80 a glass.
   ``This is indeed a world event,'' Sveinsson joked to the cameras,
adding: ``I am convinced Icelanders will learn to handle beer,
seeing as Icelanders have always been open to foreign cultural
influences.''
   He urged people to take buses home, citing lines from ``I Think
I'll Walk Home,'' a song by pop star Valgeir Gudjonsson against
drunken driving.
   The song, commissioned by the state Board of Alcoholism
Prevention, was been played incessantly on radio and TV before
``B-Day.''
   Newspapers have carried ads warning that ``beer is alcohol,''
just in case any Icelanders have forgotten after 74 years.
   In Parliament a few days ago, Education Minister Svavar Gestsson
accused the media of hyping the occasion. He said all efforts to
educate the public about the evils of drink ``have proved in vain
against this terrible flood.''
   Police said they were on heightened alert for drunken drivers.
   Iceland prides itself on having relatively low alcohol
consumption, but intake has jumped from an annual 6.7 pints per head
in 1981 to 9.45 pints now.
   The state, which controls the liquor supply, is exacting hefty
levies on beer. A 24-can case of imported beer costs about $57.60.
   The price was expected to be even higher, but the government
decided it should not outprice hard liquor. Before legalization,
smuggled beer fetched about $70 for a 24-can case.
   Beer of above 5.6-percent alcoholic content remains banned, and
pleading lack of storage space, the government has also restricted
the number of importers to three _ Budweiser of the United States,
Tuborg of Denmark and Kaiser of Austria. Two local breweries are
providing another four brands.
   Beer was completely outlawed until 1980, when the law changed to
allow Icelanders arriving from abroad to bring in 12.2 pints of
foreign beer.

<HEAD>Researchers Kick Off Dietary Study Featuring Salmon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the interest of medical science, 12 men
have volunteered to dine on salmon every day for 40 days, stroll
through one of the most beautiful areas of the city twice daily and
get paid for their trouble.
   The arrangment is part of a 100-day dietary study conducted by
the federal government to determine possible beneficial effects of
fish oil consumption. Participants and researchers gathered
Wednesday to publicize the study and generate interest in similar
research.
   Entrees will include broiled salmon with dill, salmon pate on
bagels, salmon lasagna and salmon teriyaki.
   If the assignment, which began with breakfast Tuesday, makes your
mouth water, you're not alone. More than 2,000 prospective
volunteers applied for the 12 slots. A public service announcement
recruiting volunteers generated worldwide interest and media
attention.
   But the 100-day stint has its drawbacks. Participants are
confined to the dormitory-style ``metabolic unit'' of the Letterman
Army Institute of Research at the Presidio. Constantly under the
surveillance of staff, they are allowed only two hours a week to
visit with family and friends.
   Their diets are strictly controlled. Every bite is monitored. The
only unlimited substance is water, and even that is tabulated daily.
Partipants not only clean their plates, they must scrape them
squeaky clean. Along with forks and knives, rubber spatulas are
provided with each meal.
   ``This is really a scientific study,'' said Rodger O'Brien, 54,
of San Jose. ``They weigh everything going in and everything going
out.''
   On the first day, one participant drank the required glass of
milk and sent his color-coded tray back to the kitchen. He thought
he was done. Not so, supervisors said, handing him a spatula and
requesting that he squeegee out the last drops of milk.
   ``Clean your plate takes on a new meaning,'' said project manager
Ed Blonz.
   But so far the food is drawing rave reviews _ and salmon won't be
on the menu for 18 days yet. The first 20 days are spent
establishing what researchers call a ``stabilization diet'' of
balanced, low-fat meals with no fish.
   ``The food is excellent,'' O'Brien said. ``Any one of these
meals, if you bought it in a restaurant, you'd pay some bucks for
it.''
   Researchers hope that by feeding participants a diet rich in fish
oils, they will be able to determine the purported beneficial
effects of omega-3, or polyunsaturated, fatty acids.
   Unlike studies in which participants consume massive doses of
fish oil in capsules, research chemist Gary J. Nelson said this
project seeks to replicate ``a diet people could eat at home.''
   Previous research suggests that fish oils may be beneficial in
the treatment or prevention of heart disease, cancer and other
ailments, as well as in improving the body's immune system.
   ``You name it and somebody has claimed it,'' Nelson said.
   Salmon was selected for its relatively high fat content. Some
fish, like Dover sole, is only about 1 percent fat, compared to
salmon, which is 10 percent fat.
   And it tastes good.
   Late this month, volunteers will dig in to their first helping of
King Salmon. Salmon entrees served twice-daily will provide each
participant with about 25 times the amount of fish oil as the
average American.
   Their daily regimen includes two 2-mile walks around the Army
base each day. The wake-up call is 6:30 a.m., and lights must be out
at midnight. Volunteers share starkly-furnished double rooms, as
well as a library, ``quiet room'' and day room, complete with
stereo, VCR and pool table.
   ``I'm thinking about getting a pool tournament together,'' said
Robert Trujillo, 31, a self-employed market researcher who lives in
Los Gatos. ``Another guy is a carpenter and is going to be working
on projects for his home.''
   Trujillo said he has always had an interest in scientific
research and figured this way he ``could contribute something to
science without being dead.''

<HEAD>Picture Released of Another Secret Weapon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Air Force, continuing a selective
relaxation of the security shrouding its newest weapons, released a
photograph Wednesday providing a limited view of its new stealth
cruise missile.
   The black-and-white photo shows a B-52 bomber flying with four of
the new missiles tucked under each wing.
   The picture shows the missile has flattened sides instead of a
perfectly rounded shape; that the engine air inlet is cut into the
top of the missile instead of sticking up on a pylon from the
fuselage, and the wings and tail fins are folded up against the
missile body until it is fired.
   But the angle from which the photograph was taken does not allow
any other details of the weapon's design to be discerned, and the
Air Force said Wednesday it is not prepared to say more.
   Production schedules, budget figures and tentative dates for
fielding all remain classified, said Lt. Col. Rick Oborn, a Pentagon
spokesman.
   The release of the photo of the stealth cruise, known formally as
the Advanced Cruise Missile, or AGM-129A, is the third such move in
10 months. Last April, the Air Force released an artist's sketch
that revealed the ``flying wing'' design of the new B-2 stealth
bomber.
   Then last November, the service released a photograph _ albeit a
poor one _ of the super-secret F-117A stealth jet fighter.
   Wednesday's release appeared to be tied in part to an upcoming
test of the new missile over Canada. The United States and Canada
announced Feb. 1 that Canada had agreed to let the Air Force test
the Advanced Cruise Missile in arctic conditions.
   According to Air Force officials, who asked not to be named, the
first such test was scheduled Wednesday but had to be postponed due
to weather conditions.
   The standard cruise missile is a jet-powered flying bomb that
looks like a torpedo with stubby wings and a tail fin. The missile
carries a sophisticated guidance system that allows it to hug the
ground to escape detection.
   The stealth version of the cruise missile is supposed to be even
more impervious to detection, while also offering greater range.
   The term stealth is applied to a variety of techniques used to
foil radar. By employing unusual aircraft designs and new types of
manufacturing materials, a plane or missile can absorb or deflect
radar signals without bouncing them back to an enemy tracking system.
   Although most of the publicity about stealth technology has
centered on the B-2 bomber, the General Dynamics Corp. has been
under contract since 1983 to develop and build a stealth version of
the standard cruise missile.
   The McDonnell Douglas Corp. received a separate contract in 1987
to become a second producer of the missile.
   Congressional officials disclosed almost two years ago, in April
1987, the stealth missile program was suffering from serious
production quality problems and cost overruns. Although denied by
the Air Force, the Washington Post has quoted sources as saying the
program is three years behind schedule and will cost $7 billion
instead of $5 billion.
   Acting Air Force Secretary James F. McGovern, in a written
statement released Wednesday with the picture, said the stealth
cruise missile ``will improve the long-term effectiveness of the
(bomber) leg of the (nuclear) triad.''
   ``Incorporation of advances in propulsion and guidance
technology, along with low-observable (stealth) design features,
results in a system with improvements in range, accuracy and
flexibility.''

<HEAD>Baby Dies as Mom Wins Custody Battle With State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother who fought the state so she
could bring her terminally ill 3-year-old daughter home to die
learned of her victory in the custody battle just five minutes
before the girl died in a hospital.
   ``It was a very hollow victory,'' said Sara Rahdert, an attorney
who helped Cheryl Dutchak win back little Candice.
   Mrs. Dutchak fought for eight months to regain custody of her
daughter. A judge in Clearwater signed the order Monday and Ms.
Rahdert rushed it to the child's room at All Children's Hospital in
St. Petersburg, about 25 miles away.
   The mother read the order aloud. The hospital began preparations
to discharge the baby.
   Five minutes later, Candice died.
   ``It was almost like she was waiting for me to hand that order to
her parents,'' Ms. Rahdert said. ``I know that sounds strange, but
that was what it was lie.''
   Candice suffered health problems from birth, caused by a loss of
amniotic fluid during her mother's pregnancy. Doctors had
recommended abortion because the baby might not live. Complications
kept her in the hospital for two months. She lost her right leg at
the knee because of circulation problems and she had failing kidneys.
   Last March Candice suffered brain damage after a seizure. Doctors
said the seizure occurred when Mrs. Dutchak withheld medication at
home. Mrs. Dutchak said an emergency room doctor told her to
withhold the medication.
   In April the Florida Department of Health and Rehablitative
Services charged Mrs. Dutchak with child abuse and took the girl
away. The child abuse charge was dropped, but the state retained
custody until Monday.
   In September HRS agreed to a compromise: If Mrs. Dutchak proved
she was a fit mother Candice could go home.
   The mother did what the state asked, but it wasn't enough, Ms.
Rahdert said. Earlier this month HRS officials asked a judge to add
a few more requirements before Mrs. Dutchak could take Candice home.
   Then Candice's condition worsened. On Monday, doctors called Mrs.
Dutchak and said she was likely to die soon. Mrs. Dutchak called her
lawyer who sought an emergency custody order. But HRS District
Administrator Michael Becker agreed ``for humanitarian reasons'' to
release the girl to her mother, according to HRS spokeswoman Elaine
Fulton-Jones.
   Circuit Judge Jack Page signed the order transferring custody
about 12:45 p.m., the attorney said.
   ``I dashed from the courthouse ... to the hospital ... Cheryl
read the order out loud stating that they did get custody back,''
Ms. Rahdert said. `About five minutes after mom read this order out
loud to everyone in the room, including the child, the child died.''

<HEAD>WASHN: the military.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I think we have to continually seek to find better ways to
effectively utilize the military.
   We should not be engaged in the business of perhaps sometimes
degrading our military roles and missions in an ineffective
interdiction job of drugs.
   I can't claim any expertise in that area now.
   It's a matter that I will have to get into and get into in some
depth once I'm confirmed.
   Q. There's been some suggestion that the accusations against you
have been fueled by the Pentagon itself because of its fear and
concern about the reforms you would make. Any comments?
   A. If that's true, I would consider that to be a very, very
strong recommendation for my confirmation. (Laughter.)
   Q. Several hundred men and women are ousted each year from the
armed aervices because they are homosexuals. How would you _ would
you favor the creation of a panel to study whether the military's
ban should be ended?
   A. Well my visceral reaction is that it should not be, but it's a
matter on which I haven't done _ quite frankly, have not done much
thinking nor paid close attention to.
   I'm sure it is a matter that will come to my early attention and
that I will have to deal with it.
   I am not prepared to do so right now.
   Q. If confirmed, what effect will all the debate leading up to
the vote have on your ability to function as secretary of defense?
   A. I have been assured by my potential subordinates that it would
have no adverse effect on them in terms of following my direction
and my authority.
   I think when people suggest that I would be incapable or crippled
or in some way debilitated in the performance of my duty, to explain
how they think I would be.
   I think once you're given that authority, backed up by the
president of the United States, and you're engaged in the active
cooperation of Congress, that my effectiveness would not be
diminished.
   And two, there is a very clear perception in the military
community that I am being very, very unfairly treated and my
confirmation would be considered vindication.
   And I think to survive the kind of campaign that I have been
through actually indicates strength and not weakness.
   Q. Senator, could you tell us what specific defense or national
security programs are being delayed pending your confirmation?

<HEAD>Young West Germans Unworried By Soviet Military Threat, Poll Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 90 percent of young West
Germans believe the Soviet bloc is not a military threat and most
want their country to cut defense spending, according to a poll
released Wednesday.
   The survey, commissioned by ZDF television, appeared to be yet
another sign of the positive attitude many Germans are developing
toward the Kremlin, especially toward Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and his promise to withdraw troops from Europe.
   ZDF said the independent Forschungsgruppe Wahlen research company
surveyed 825 West Germans between 16 and 29 years old. The network
did not provide a margin of error for the poll, which was conducted
from Feb. 17 to Feb. 23.
   The poll said 87 percent do not feel militarily threatened by the
Warsaw Pact and 78 percent believe their nation should cut defense
spending, which has an annual level of about $30 billion.
   The results of the poll were described during a ZDF program
Wednesday night on the armed forces and provided in advance to The
Associated Press.
   Public opinion polls last year repeatedly said Gorbachev's
popularity far outstripped that of then-President Reagan.
   Many West Germans have come to regard the Cold War as being
nearly over, recent polls indicate. In addition, many appear smitten
with the ``Gorbymania'' orchestrated by the increasingly
image-conscious Kremlin.
   They also responded positively to Gorbachev's pledge earlier this
year to unilaterally cut armed forces by 500,000 troops in two
years, including a reduction of 240,000 soldiers in the European
theater.
   Gorbachev also said the production of arms and military supplies
would be slashed by 19.5 percent and 10,000 tanks would be
eliminated in Europe.
   The perception that the Soviet threat is diminishing has led to
growing questions about the need for U.S. military training flights
in West Germany and the routine maneuvers that chew up farmers'
fields and disrupt daily life.
   A key issue for the federal government in Bonn is whether to
replace the approximately 600 aging Lance nuclear missiles stationed
in West Germany.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government wants the decision delayed
until 1991 or 1992, to keep it from becoming an issue in next year's
general elections.

   L. Paul Bremer, the State Department's senior
terrorism expert, has resigned, sources said Wednesday.
   In addition, Rozanne L. Ridgway, assistant secretary of state for
European affairs, has also quit, said the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Bremer, a 48-year-old career ambassador, will remain temporarily
to conduct a personnel study, the sources said.
   Bremer is a former U.S. envoy to The Netherlands and in a 22-year
diplomatic career he served as chief assistant to three secretaries
of state _ William P. Rogers, Henry A. Kissinger and Alexander M.
Haig Jr.
   There was speculation that Bremer would take a job with
Kissinger's private consulting firm.
   Ms. Ridgway, retiring after 31 years in the foreign service,
asked Secretary of State James A. Baker III to take her name out of
contention for the post of U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization or for any other overseas job.
   A former ambassador to East Germany and Finland, she informed
Baker she wants to remain in the area with her husband, Coast Guard
Capt. Theodore Dening.
   Ms. Ridgway attended all five summit meetings former President
Reagan held with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and was
considered a senior expert on Soviet affairs.
   During the transition to the Bush administration, Ms. Ridgway was
understood to be in contention for a top State Department job, but
wasn't picked. No successor has been named to head the European
bureau, a post she has held since mid-1985.
   Bremer headed the Office to Counter Terrorism for 2 1@2 years.
His strong stand against terrorism, and criticism of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, complemented the views of George P. Shultz,
who was the Secretary of State during the period.

Police Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who allegedly left her 4-year-old son in
the care of two homeless men in the city bus terminal has a long
history of scrapes with the law, police and relatives say.
   Deborah Longueil, 23, was arrested Tuesday when she reported her
son missing 26 hours after she let two strangers take care of the
boy while she allegedly took drugs and worked as a prostitute.
   The boy, who had been found by police at the bus terminal, was
placed in city custody, and Ms. Longueil was arrested on a charge of
endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor.
   ``She said she wanted to see her baby,'' said Port Authority
police Sgt. Bernard Poggioli. ``When we told her she was being
arrested, she was shocked. Then the tears came.''
   There was less shock in Brattleboro, Vt., where a relative said
Ms. Longueil had grown up beset by problems _ difficult family
relations, drugs and drinking, young motherhood, a couple of minor
scrapes with the law.
   ``She had petty larceny here. Alcohol is her biggest problem, and
drugs. She got into drugs quite a bit,'' said Frank Longueil, the
woman's uncle. ``It started way back when she was a kid; her father
used to drink considerable. She and her mother didn't get along.
Just one of those bad scenes.''
   At the Brattleboro Police Department, ``We know who she is,''
said Sgt. Steve Rowell. A warrant for her arrest has been pending
since she failed to appear at a court hearing Dec. 27 on a
shoplifting charge.
   The charge is a minor one: Stealing two marble bookends and three
boxes of candles Nov. 12 from a stationery store in Brattleboro, a
misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $300 fine.
   Vermont District Court records list a few earlier cases: a $15
fine for shoplifting in 1982, probation for a burglary in 1983 and a
$25 fine in 1983 for carrying an open beer. The father of Ms.
Longueil's child has been in bigger trouble: Michael Young is in
state prison in Vermont for a burglary conviction, authorities said.
   Poggioli said Ms. Longueil once went through a drug
rehabilitation program. Her father, Sheldon, who came to New York on
Tuesday night, told reporters: ``She needs drugs.''
   She allegedly came to New York with her son, Adam, to flee the
arrest warrant, staying in cheap hotels.
   On Monday, Officer Bernard Frain saw the boy with two men in a
restricted area of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. They told him
they were baby-sitting while his mother worked as a prostitute,
police said.
   The men did not know the woman's name or the boy's. Police
arrested them on trespassing charges.
   When Ms. Longueil appeared Tuesday at the police station to
report her son missing, she said she looked for her child all night,
said Poggioli.
   ``But she wasn't looking too hard. We have people on the street
who say they saw her doing crack,'' he said.
   Gerald McKelvey, spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney,
said Ms. Longueil's arraignment was not scheduled as of Wednesday
afternoon. Fran Friedberg, a lawyer with the city's welfare office,
said a hearing also had not been set on the Longueil family's
request to gain custody of the child.

   Dr. Louis Sullivan took his place at the helm
of the largest federal department Wednesday after the Senate
approved his nomination 98-1. One senator called the new health and
human services secretary a ``compassionate professional.''
   The lone vote against Sullivan was cast by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., who criticized the Atlanta doctor for declining to take a
position on several abortion-related issues, including research on
fetal tissue.
   In other confirmation action Wednesday:
   _The Senate voted 99-0 to approve retired Adm. James D. Watkins,
as the first career military man to head the Department of Energy,
which devotes two-thirds of its budget to developing, building and
testing the nation's nuclear arsenal at a network of 15 major plants
in a dozen states.
   Watkins, 61, who retired in 1986 after 41 years in the Navy,
encountered no opposition during the confirmation process and was
widely praised on Capitol Hill as a fit choice for guiding the
Energy Department at a time of growing controversy over the
condition of its nuclear weapons complex.
   _Edward J. Derwinski, nominated to head the new Veterans
Department, told his confirmation hearing he still doesn't believe
he endangered anyone 12 years ago with an unthinking warning to the
Korean embassy that one of their agents was about to defect to the
United States.
   In initial questioning by the Veterans Affairs Committee, no
senator criticized his action in the Korean matter, but Chairman
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said, ``I do not intend to take a position
until the vote tomorrow.''
   _William J. Bennett, nominated to lead the fight against drug
abuse, told his confirmation hearing that a well-fashioned strategy
can ease the problem but that it ``will not disappear overnight.''
   Bennett appeared a virtual shoo-in for endorsement by the
Judiciary Committee, with his sharpest critic, Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., saying he was considering voting against the nomination but
that he hadn't made up his mind.
   Sullivan, a 55-year-old blood specialist, was roundly praised by
Democrats and Republicans alike for his commitment to the
health-care needs of the poor, demonstrated by his founding of the
Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta to train physicians to work
in medically underserved areas.
   ``I'm confident that Dr. Sullivan is going to be a caring
advocate for these millions of Americans,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the task of administering a
department with a nearly $400 billion budget and 114,000 employees
``must fall on the shoulders of a compassionate professional. I
believe that Dr. Sullivan is such a person.''
   The issue of abortion has been the most controversial for
Sullivan since his remarks in the Atlanta Journal Constitution that
he supported abortion and to Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., that he
favored retaining the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing the procedure.
   At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee,
Sullivan apologized to Packwood for having ``misspoken'' his
position and said he holds the same views on the subject as the
president: He is opposed to abortion except in cases of rape, incest
or danger to the mother's life; he opposes federal financing of
abortions except when the mother's life is threatened, and he favors
reversal of Roe vs. Wade.
   Packwood, who is strongly pro-choice, said he disagreed with
Sullivan's stand on abortion, but he said the issue has gotten undue
attention considering that the Department of Health and Human
Services has few abortion-related activities.
   ``In every sense this man is qualified to do a first rate job.
The issue of abortion ought to be irrelevant,'' Packwood said.
   Several senators said that while they admired Sullivan's attempt
to avoid any conflicts of interest by forfeiting nearly $300,000 in
severance pay from his job as president of Morehouse, the sacrifice
wasn't necessary and could discourage others from taking government
jobs.

<HEAD>Expanded Methadone Program Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal agencies on Wednesday proposed to
help fight AIDS among heroin addicts by allowing interim methadone
treatment in cities where comprehensive treatment programs have
waiting lists.
   The plan, to be published in Thursday's Federal Register, was
proposed by the Food and Drug Administration and the National
Institute on Drug Abuse to make methadone treatments available to
more addicts sooner and reduce exposure to AIDS through
needle-sharing.
   Also Thursday, final rules will go into effect to streamline
regulations governing methadone treatment programs and make other
changes, including elimination of the counselor-patient ratio at
treatment clinics. Previously programs had to have one counselor for
every 50 patients.
   Intravenous heroin addicts often share needles and, in doing so,
become infected with the virus that causes the deadly disease.
   Methadone, which is used to help relieve an addict's craving for
heroin, is taken by mouth, which eliminates the risk from needles.
   Although methadone is best used as part of a comprehensive
treatment program that includes counseling and other vocational and
rehabilitative services, many clinics have waiting lists of six
months or more, the agencies said.
   About 500,000 of the estimated 1.2 million intravenous drug
abusers in the country are heroin addicts, and three out of four
cities with methadone treatment clinics have waiting lists, the
institute said.
   Under the proposal, heroin addicts would be able to receive
methadone treatment seven days a week at out-patient clinics and
from mobile medical units, but the drug would not be provided for
take-home use. Participants would be counseled on avoiding acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   The proposal is based on a pilot program at Beth Israel Medical
Center in New York, which ``appears to have reduced the use of
needles,'' the two agencies said.

<HEAD>WASHN: your confirmation?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. I don't know of any that are being delayed.
   We're in the process now of trying to come up with the revised
budget based on the budgetary constraints of a zero budget for
fiscal year 1990.
   And that's ongoing right now and the numbers crunchers are hard
at work.
   Q. It appears that the Soviets must reduce their huge military
expenditures if Gorbachev's perestroika is to succeed. In that
event, is this any time for the United States and NATO to make
unilateral reductions in defense expenditures?
   A. I think unilateral reductions would be dangerous in the
extreme.
   We must not.
   We must continue to modernize and improve our forces.
   We cannot engage in a euphemistic orgy of neglect of our defense
establishments throughout NATO and the United States.
   The fact is, if perestroika succeeds, what will emerge will be a
much stronger Soviet Union.
   That omens well for the future if it is a more benign Soviet
Union, one that is not so bent on self-aggrandizement; a Soviet
Union that is prepared to live in peace and harmony with its
neighbors.
   That will be, of course, a very happy outcome.
   And then, perhaps, we can begin the business of beating swords
into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks.
   But it is altogether possible that what could emerge from a
successful reform effort that strengthens the Soviet economy would
be a further emboldened Soviet Union, ever more threatening and ever
more ominous.
   We must be prepared for either outcome.
   Q. In the event that you do not win confirmation, will you return
to consulting for defense contractors?
   A. I have no intention of ever returning to defense consulting
again in any circumstance.
   Following my career in government service, should it extend over
a period of a few years from now, or should it extend over a much
shorter period of time, it is my expectation that my involvement in
national security matters will be in the academic world primarily,
my involvement in defense matters.
   In all probability, if _ once I _ well, I won't say in
probability, I'd say it's a virtual certainty that once I complete
my public service _ I've spent virtually all of my adult life in
public service, only two, a little over two years, two and a half
years in the private sector and that's all, the rest of it has been
given over to public service.
   I've accumulated very little in this world, being a school
teacher by background _ or by trade, and a clergyman's son by
background.
   And I remember what John Nance Garner once said when he left the
vice presidency after having served as speaker of the House, vice
president of the United States, a distinguished career, he said he
was going to cross that Potomac heading west and never return again.
   He never came back, and he lived to be 95 years old. (Laughter.)
   However, I will not make that kind of flat commitment.
   It is my plan to load up my 1972 Dodge Charger 400 Magnum with
all my possessions, mattress strapped to the roof, and all that sort
of thing, and head back to Texas to _ as my permanent residence.
   But, I might be back from time to time in one capacity or another.
   Incidentally, in that my grandparents lived into their 90s, my
enemies can take small comfort that I will depart this world anytime
soon. (Laughter.)
   Q. Representative Aspin's plan to fund all strategic programs at
$31 billion over a 10-year period has been proposed. Is this the
type of proposal that ought to be coming from a secretary of
defense?

<HEAD>Congress Told Firefighters Need Better `Right-To-Know' System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters nationwide need a better system
for notifying them of hazardous materials so they can prevent
accidents such as the one that killed six Kansas City, Mo. firemen
last year, a House panel was told Wednesday.
   ``They had no warning that the fire they were trying to
extinguish was a time bomb waiting to take their lives,'' said Terry
Conroy, president of the Kansas City chapter of the International
Association of Firefighters.
   At a hearing before a House Government Operations subcommittee,
Conroy, other firefighting officials and several members of Congress
said that accident pointed to the need for tighter and more
coordinated regulation of hazardous materials as well as improved
training for firemen.
   The Kansas City firefighters were killed when a trailer loaded
with tons of blasting agent exploded at a highway construction site
Nov. 29. Lawmakers were told that a dispatcher warned the
firefighters that explosives might be in the area but was unable to
provide the specific location or the type of hazardous material
involved.
   Most of the criticism was directed at the regulatory system
spread among a host of federal agencies as well as state and local
governments.
   Current laws have created ``tremendous duplication and confusion
and, at the same time, leave gaping voids,'' said John Eversole,
commander of the Chicago fire department's hazardous incident team.
   Lawmakers were told that current ``right-to-know'' laws were
inadequate and that many companies do not comply with requirements
to report chemicals and other hazardous materials to fire
departments and other emergency planning agencies.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the employment and housing
subcommittee, suggested that Congress consider criminal penalties
for those failing to report hazardous materials.
   Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo., complained that the blasting agent in the
Kansas City accident was not on an Environmental Protection Agency
list of materials that must be reported to firefighters. Jim Makris,
an EPA official, said the agency would consider adding it to the
reporting requirement.

<HEAD>Witness Says North ``Assumed Worst'' on Congressional Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired general testified at Oliver North's
trial Wednesday that he and North decided in 1985 ``to assume the
worst'' _ that North's actions were covered by a law forbidding
official aid to the Nicaraguan Contras _ and to act accordingly.
   Earlier in the day, however, Robert Owen testified that he made
many trips between Washington and Central America for North,
carrying instructions from the presidential aide for how the
guerrilla war was to be fought, and carrying maps and money.
   Owen said North told him he acted with the knowledge and approval
of superiors. The courier testified at one point that North said he
had President Reagan's approval, but he said later that testimony
was wrong, that North never got more specific than ``superiors.''
   Retired Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, an ardent anti-communist who
directed spy activities in three wars, also testified he persuaded
Taiwan and another Asian nation _ with North's knowledge _ to give
$5 million each to the Nicaraguan Contras but the plan failed for
lack of a required signal from the U.S. government.
   At the time, the Reagan administration was under a
Congress-imposed ban, the Boland Amendment, against helping the
rebels conducting a guerrilla war against the Nicaraguan government.
The second Asian country was not identified.
   Singlaub said he proposed to North in December 1984 to solicit
funds in the Far East from Singlaub's ``close personal friends at
high levels sympathetic to the cause.''
   ``I explained that the policy of the United States was quite
clear, to support the Nicaraguan resistance, and that Congress'
temporary action stopped us,'' he testified.
   Singlaub, who will return to the witness stand Thursday, was the
fourth witness in the trial which resumed despite serious,
still-unresolved, national security issues that had halted testimony
for nearly two days.
   Defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan has renewed a motion to declare
that a federal law designed to protect state secrets from being
spilled in the courtroom is unconstitutional as applied to the North
case. Sullivan also has asked that the 12 criminal charges against
North be thrown out.
   On Wednesday, the government replied that the process of handling
classified material in court ``is not, as North contends, a reason
to conclude that the trial is unworkable.''
   While North's trial continues, one of the key figures who will
testify for the prosecution, former National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane, is to be sentenced Friday by U.S. District Judge Aubrey
Robinson. He pleaded guilty a year ago to four misdemeanors
involving withholding information from Congress about North's
activities.
   North is accused of lying to Congress about his activities on
behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras _ activities in which both he and
Singlaub were deeply involved _ in the 1984-1986 period when the
Boland Amendment banned such aid.
   ``I argued that it could not possibly apply to the office of the
president,'' Singlaub said. North, then a Marine lieutenant colonel,
was assigned to the president's National Security Council.
   ``Colonel North said he agreed, but could not get consensus _
some said it did apply some said it did not,'' Singlaub said. They
agreed that ``the best thing was to assume the worst: that it did
apply.''
   Singlaub said they worked out an arrangement under which he would
work with rebel leader Adolfo Calero and keep North informed.
   Owen, at one point in his testimony, said North told him that
everything he was doing was with the president's knowledge. But he
later said he ``misspoke'' and that North only referred to orders
from superiors.
   ``Colonel North never said anything about the president's
knowledge,'' Owen said under questioning by assistant prosecutor
David Zornow.
   Q. Did he ever tell you the president of the United States told
him to lie?
   A. No sir.
   Q. Did he ever tell you the president of the United States told
him to conceal what he was doing.
   A. No sir.
   Further, said Owen, North never invoked the names of the national
security advisers he worked under, McFarlane and Adm. John
Poindexter.
   North's defense is that he had authorization from superiors for
everything he did.
   Owen also said he met with at least half a dozen CIA agents in
Central American countries to discuss supply efforts to the Contras.
The agents were referred to in the courtroom by number.
   Singlaub, testifying about his efforts to get foreign funds, said
he was going to try a second time to get the Asian money for the
Contras, got assurance from then-Assistant Secretary of State
Elliott Abrams that a signal would be given, then was telephoned by
Abrams and told to call off the effort.
   Singlaub also testified that in March 1985 he went to Honduras
and met with Nicaraguan rebel leaders and base commanders, and
returned to give North a priority list of items that Contra
commander Enrique Bermudez suggested.
   Calero put $5 million into an account in Europe and the weapons
were bought and arrived in Central America by ship in 1985, Singlaub
said.
   In August 1986, days before the House Intelligence Committee had
a face-to-face meeting with North to ask about his activities,
Singlaub said, he offered a new list of weapons' prices to North who
told him he was ``no longer in the business'' and to send them to
the CIA.
   Singlaub said he wrote to CIA Director William Casey, his World
War II boss in the Office of Strategic Services _ the CIA's
forerunner _ and said the list ``was developed in conjunction with a
member of the NSC who is knowledgeable of the urgent need'' of the
Contras.
   Later he saw Casey ``who threatened to throw me out of his office
if I discussed the subject of Nicaragua in his presence. I told him
I would keep North informed. ... He indicated that was the proper
place.''

   An anonymous telephone caller Wednesday said a
kidnapped Israeli soldier would be freed if authorities released
Palestinian prisoners and compensate victims of the Arab uprising, a
Palestinian lawyer said.
   The soldier, Avi Sassportas, 21, has been missing since Feb. 16
when he disappeared en route from the army to his home in the
coastal city of Ashdod.
   He was dressed in his olive green army uniform and armed with an
M-16 at the time of his disappearance, media reports have said.
   The call to Fayez Abu Rahmeh, a pro-PLO lawyer from Gaza City in
the occupied Gaza Strip, was the second reported Wednesday. An
earlier anonymous call was received by the Agence France Presse news
bureau in Jerusalem, AFP reporters said.
   Both callers promised that a videotape of Sassportas would be
released, but none was reported found. It could not be determined if
the calls were made by the same person.
   Police coordinating the search for the missing paratrooper
declined to comment.
   According to Rahmeh, the caller said his group, the Palestinian
Arab Army, would release the soldier if Israel agreed to a series of
demands.
   The demands included release of Palestinians apprehended before
and during the uprising in the Israeli-occupied lands, and
compensation for families who had lost children or whose homes had
been demolished as punishment, Rahmeh said.
   He said the caller also demanded that Israel broadcast film the
caller contended exists on the March 1988 assassination of Khalil
Wazir in Tunis. Wazir, also known by his nom de guerre, Abu Jihad,
was the No. 2 man in Yasser Arafat's PLO.
   There have been allegations that Israel was responsible for the
assassination, but Israel never has publicly admitted involvement.
   The call to Rahmeh was the fifth known to have been made in the
Sassportas case.
   Last week, a PLO faction, the Democratic Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, the army
said. Israel radio on Tuesday received a call from a man who said
the soldier would be released if Israel freed 1,500 Palestinian
prisoners.
   Wednesday's call to AFP was the second this week.
   AFP journalist Jean-Luc Porte said the caller was the same man
who telephoned the agency on Monday to claim the abduction of the
soldier on behalf of the Palestinian Arab Army.
   The group was not publicly known before the call, but West Bank
army commander Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna said it has been operating
since the start of the 14-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The caller told AFP that a nine-minute videotape of the kidnapped
Israeli was delivered to the United Nations in Israel, but spokesmen
for the major U.N. agencies here said they had no information about
such a tape.

   A. I'd rather not comment on any proposals emanating from
Congress right now. (Laughter.)
   It reminds me of the story about Paddy O'Leary who was on his
deathbed, very ill, in extremis, and a priest was summoned to his
side.
   And the priest leaned over him and said, ``Paddy, do you renounce
the devil and all his works?''
   And Paddy looked up at the priest and said, ``Father, I'm in no
condition now to make any enemies.'' (Laughter, applause.)
   Q. A recent ABC poll indicated that the American people believe
that you should not have been nominated, but, since you have been,
that President Bush's choice should be supported. Does the Senate
run a risk if it votes against your _ votes against public opinion?
   A. I have never been one _ I would be hypocritical if I said
otherwise.
   I've never been one that believes that the Congress should simply
follow polling results because it is incumbent on members of
Congress to lead and to help shape public opinion, not simply
blindly follow a popular whim of the moment.
   So, I think senators should make up their mind based on their own
personal convictions, their own knowledge and understanding of the
issues at hand.
   Q. Senator, before asking my last question, I'd like to present
you with a certificate of appreciation from the National Press Club,
and I'd also like to present you with a Press Club paperweight. The
_ my last question _ and I must say that you've taken the wind out
of my sails a little bit. I know that upon retirement you had said
before that you'd like to be a linebacker coach for Tom Landry.
(Laughter.) Now what? (Laughter.)
   A. Well, just like I thought the Alamo analogy was unfortunate, I
think the Landry analogy is unfortunate as well. (Laughter.)
   I didn't say defensive line coach for Landry, I simply said for
the _ I really said for the SMU Mustangs.
   They haven't had a football team for the last two years because
of some rather shortsighted and unfair judgments rendered by the
NCAA. (Laughter.)
   But, I don't think I could do that on a professional level.
   I might apply at Southern Methodist University for that job,
which I understand is open now. (Applause.)

<HEAD>General Assembly Approves Namibia Independence Financing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Assembly on Wednesday approved
$416 million for the U.N. peacekeeping mission that will oversee
Namibia's passage to freedom after 74 years of South African rule.
   ``The show is on the road,'' declared Marrack Goulding, the
ndersecretary-general in charge of all U.N. peacekeeping operations.
   The one-year U.N. plan for Namibia's independence begins April 1.
   The 159-member assembly adopted by consensus a funding resolution
for a Namibia force that will consist of 4,650 peacekeepers, 500
police, and about 2,200 civilian staff and election monitors.
   The mission will oversee elections for a constituent assembly in
November that will organize a black majority-ruled government _
creating the world's newest independent nation and in the process
settling the last major colonial problem in Africa.
   U.N. officials confirmed publicly that South Africa will receive
a generous share of the U.N. funds as the force makes purchases in
the region, including $10.2 million in gasoline and aviation fuel.
   Some black African nations, led by Zambia and Zimbabwe, fought to
make the world body heed its own calls for trade embargoes on South
African products.
   ``We don't have any oil distribution in Namibia, so we have to
use the oil that is there,'' said Martti Ahtisaari, the U.N.
undersecretary-general in charge of the civilian phase of the
Namibia transition plan.
   ``For the military component, the maximum tasks come in the first
few weeks of the transition period,'' said Goulding.
   He said the military ``has to ensure that the South African
forces are confined to barracks; ... to start supervising the
withdrawal of South African forces down to 1,500; ... to start the
process of dismantling the command structures and taking into
custody the arms of the various local forces that South Africa has
set up in Namibia.''
   White-dominated South Africa has ruled Namibia since it captured
the colony from Germany during World War I.
   In December, South Africa signed accords with Angola and Cuba
agreeing to free Namibia if 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angola
are sent home by mid-1991.
   Marxist Angola adjoins Namibia.
   Namibia is one of the world's most sparsely populated areas, with
an estimated 1.3 million people occupying territory as large as
France and West Germany combined. The Ovambo people inhabit the
relatively fertile northern region and make up about half the
population. There are 75,000 white residents.
   The economy is dominated by mining, with diamonds, uranium and
copper the principal minerals.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Amount of Aflatoxin in Food Supply Unlikely to Hurt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
Wednesday that cancer-causing aflatoxin is unlikely to get into the
food supply in amounts great enough to hurt anyone.
   ``Anytime we have a drought, we are going to see more aflatoxin
problems,'' Yeutter told the House Appropriations subcommittee on
rural development, agriculture and related agencies. ``That doesn't
mean we're going to have more in the food supply ... or any that
slips in is going to hurt anyone.''
   Yeutter criticized a recent article in The Wall Street Journal
that said aflatoxin-tainted corn is moving through the nation's food
chain because of inadequate sampling and unreliable testing.
   He said the article implied that people are being cavalier about
the existence of the toxin.
   ``Everyone is going to do their best to minimize the risk of
letting aflatoxin into the food supply,'' he said. ``Nobody in the
food chain wants it.''
   Last year's heat and drought were ideal for development of the
fungus that produces aflatoxin, which researchers have linked to the
development of liver cancer in laboratory rats.
   The level of aflatoxin allowed in corn is 20 parts per billion.
   On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration said about 6 percent
_ 95 samples out of 1,650 _ of the field corn tested in recent
months had higher levels.
   That corn cannot be used for human consumption, but can be
diverted to feed non-dairy cattle, the FDA said.
   FDA tested about 263 samples of corn flour and corn meal and
found 2 percent, or six samples, to have more than 20 parts of
aflatoxin per billion. FDA policy requires that these products be
removed from the market.
   In answer to another question from the subcommittee, Yeutter said
he considers the chance of international trade reform to be better
than it has been in a decade.
   He said that there are some hurdles the United States and the
European Community must work out before talks in the Uruguay Round
resume next month in Geneva.
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic we'll get that worked out between now
and April,'' he told the committee.
   ``What happens in the Uruguay Round will determine what we should
have in farm legislation,'' Yeutter said.
   He said he doesn't anticipate any significant changes from the
1985 farm bill that is due to expire in 1990. He said Congress could
extend the 1985 law until the Uruguay talks are complete, or pass a
new bill and amend it as necessary after the negotiations.

<HEAD>Peru Rekindles Austerity Plan As Inflation Continues Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday installed the second
in a series of four monthly austerity measures aimed at reducing
record inflation by cutting subsidies on basic foods and
transportation.
   Consumer prices rose 42.5 percent in February, the National
Statistics Institute reported Wednesday, despite the austerity plan
launched Feb. 1.
   The measures Wednesday included a devaluation of 23.3 percent,
bringing the value of the official Peruvian currency, the inti, from
920 to 1,200 to the dollar.
   In addition, the prices of products subsidized by the government
were increased. Consumer prices for basic foods, such as wheat,
cooking oil and milk, were increased between 33 percent and 50
percent, and gasoline was increased 28 percent, according to the
government.
   The minimum monthly wage rose from 42,000 intis to 55,000,
equivalent to $46 at the official rate, and salaries for all state
employees and non-unionized private workers rose a similar
percentage.
   Analysts say Peru's working class and poor have been hit hardest
by rocketing inflation, which ran a record 1,722 percent last year
as a result of subsidy-fueled deficit spending under President Alan
Garcia, and a dramatic shrinkage of the economy last year estimated
at 8.4 percent.
   Venezuela's subsidy-cutting plan that raised prices on gasoline
prices and bus tickets this week set off widespread rioting that
left at least 100 dead.
   Garcia's administration has acknowledged inflation will continue
to grow in the short term due to the price and wage increases but
eventually decline with a decrease in government spending for
subsidies.
   The National Statistics Institute said inflation so far this year
has reached 109.9 percent. Consumer prices rose 47.3 percent in
January.
   Prior to the program of austerity installments, which concludes
in May, the government over the past year has been steadily cutting
back on the types of products its subsidizes.
   Now most imported products now must be purchased at the floating
free market exchange rate, which was 1,300 intis to the dollar and
unchanged by Wednesday's measures.

   Police said Wednesday that
three more people were arrested in the death of 14-year-old activist
Stompie Seipei, who purportedly was killed by Winnie Mandela's
bodyguards.
   Police Lt. Col. J.H. Labuscagne said the two men and one woman
will be formally charged in a Johannesburg court on Thursday. He did
not release their names but said the two men had links to Mrs.
Mandela's group of bodyguards, known as the Mandela United soccer
club.
   Three men who were part of Mandela United were charged earlier
with Seipei's murder.
   Mrs. Mandela is the wife of jailed African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela.
   Seipei was allegedly beaten in December by the bodyguards at her
home in Soweto, outside Johannesburg. His decomposed body was found
in a field in January, police said.
   Mrs. Mandela denied any wrongdoing on her part, but refused to
give a full account of her role in the controversy involving the
soccer club, which she established in 1986.

<TEXT>
   Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo, meeting
Wednesday with Vice President Dan Quayle, said leftist-ruled
Nicaragua should start democratic reforms before a final agreement
to disband the Contra rebels.
   Cerezo told reporters after his half-hour session with Quayle
that the U.S. officials ``still have reservations'' about the peace
agreement reached two weeks ago by the five Central American
presidents.
   Cerezo's session with Quayle and a similar meeting scheduled
Thursday with President Bush offered an opportunity to voice U.S.
concerns about Nicaragua's intentions in the agreement, U.S.
officials said.
   A chief complaint expressed by Bush administration officials is
lack of an enforcement mechanism to ensure the ruling Sandinistas in
Nicaragua live up to promised reforms.
   Quayle emphasized that concern Wednesday, and Bush is expected to
make the same point, administration officials said.
   Previous U.S. policy held that the U.S.-backed Contras provided
the goad which could push the Sandinistas into democratization.
   One major roadblock to a Nicaraguan peace plan has been an
inability to agree on whether disarmament of the Contras of internal
reforms in Nicaragua should come first.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega pledged in the agreement last
month to free political prisoners, hold early elections, allow
opposition parties access to the media and repatriate the Contras.
   But there was no timetable for those reforms and the five
presidents said they would agree on those details within 90 days.
   Cerezo, asked Wednesday when the Sandinistas should implement
reforms, said, ``They have to make the things before and at the same
time when we affirm the plans for the contras demobilization.''
   Cerezo said he assured Quayle the Contras would disarm ``in an
orderly manner.''
   Quayle encouraged continued meetings between the Central American
presidents and with U.S. representatives to further the peace
process, said an administration official who declined to be
identified.
   Cerezo said the Sandinistas need help from Europe and the United
States to rebuild their economy after almost a decade of internal
war and they know that assistance only will be offered if there is
peace throughout Central America.
   The vice president also brought up Guatemalan human rights with
Cerezo, said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity, but
the official offered no details.
   Administration officials wanted to discuss U.S. concerns over
continuing human rights abuses in Guatemala, State Department
sources said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they are
convinced human rights violations are not a matter of government
policy but that those guilty of politically-motivated crimes must be
brought to justice.
   Americas Watch, a private rights group, has said Guatemala's
record on the rights issue is far worse than the administration is
willing to concede.
   Juan Mendez, the executive director of Americas Watch, told
Congress last month that Guatemala ``continues to have one of the
worst human rights records in the Western Hemisphere'' despite more
than three years of civilian government.
   Mendez said the number of violent abuses in Guatemala rose last
year and rural areas continue to live under de facto military
dictatorship.

<HEAD>Bush Pitches For Tax Change</HEAD>

   President Bush drew on his recent Asian trip to
make a new pitch for lower capital gains taxes Wednesday, claiming
western Pacific businesses enjoy a competitive tax advantage over
U.S. companies.
   ``The `four dragons' of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South
Korea all exempt long-term capital gains from tax, total exemption.
Japan also had no tax on capital gains during its meteoric rise to
economic power,'' Bush told a business group at the White House.
   In his 1989 budget, Bush proposed that the tax on capital gains
be lowered to a maximum of 15 percent from its current rate of 28
percent or, in some cases, 33 percent.
   ``While I was in Asia, this recent trip, I had a chance to think
seriously about what sets our trading partners apart from us, and I
realized that we may have erected a barrier to our own success and
deprived ourselves of vital long-term investment that our
competitors have always enjoyed,'' Bush said.
   He returned Monday from a five-day trip to Japan, China and South
Korea.
   Speaking to about 250 members of the Small Business Legislative
Council in the East Room, Bush said, ``By taxing capital gains, we
impede our own progress and we turn the playing field into an uphill
climb.''
   Bush claims that lowering the tax on capital gains _ profits from
the sale of stock, real estate, works of art or other assets _ will
spur business investment, reaping for the Treasury more than it
costs.
   However, the idea has generated fierce opposition in the
Democratic-controlled Congress, where leaders have sought to portray
it as a new tax break for the rich.
   Bush on Wednesday insisted the tax break will increase revenues
$4.8 billion annually.
   Private economists are divided on whether lowering capital gains
taxes would increase or decrease revenues.
   While in Seoul, Bush cautioned the South Korean National Assembly
to do more in opening markets and avoiding protectionism.
   He made reference to that in Wednesday's address, claiming he had
stressed to Asian trading partners ``at every stop...the need for
keeping these markets open.''

<HEAD>War on Drugs Being Lost Internationally: Baker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told
Congress on Wednesday that the international war on illegal drugs
``is clearly not being won'' and might even be ``slipping
backwards.''
   The assessment was in the annual presidential report on global
drug trafficking, which Baker sent to Capitol Hill.
   The wide-ranging report, which singled out the new government in
Mexico for some praise, listed 17 countries or territories as major
illegal drug producers or transit points, yet found their
governments to be helping in the U.S. drug battle.
   The president's action, known formally as ``certification,''
means those nations will not lose U.S. military or economic aid or
become ineligible for loans and other trade preferences.
   At the same time, Bush recommended that Burma and Laos be added
to the list of nations ineligible for U.S. aid because of their
support for drug trafficking.
   That step, however, is virtually meaningless since neither
nation, or the others in the same list _ Afghanistan, Iran, Syria
and Panama _ receives any U.S. aid. The action, however, does permit
the government to impose tariffs or tighten custom rules against
certain imports.
   The study is expected to spark controversy on Capitol Hill
because of its treatment of Mexico and several other nations known
to be major drug exporters or transit points.
   Last year, the Senate voted 63-27 to punish Mexico for its lack
of cooperation in the battle against drugs, but the House killed a
similar measure. This year, Congress has 45 days to decide whether
it agrees with the president's findings.
   The most striking language came in the dim view taken by Baker of
the international battle against illicit drugs.
   The secretary said he and the president ``are both deeply
troubled by the state of affairs. ... Both here and abroad, the
international war on narcotics is clearly not being won. In fact, in
some areas, we appear to be slipping backwards.''
   Ann Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, said Baker's grim assessment was based on the
worldwide increases in marijuana, opium and coca production, as well
as a worldwide increase in drug abuse.
   ``These twin increases fuel ... an increase in power of drug
trafficking cartels _ and that worries us,'' said Ms. Wrobleski, who
discussed the report with journalists.
   In his letter accompanying the report, Baker pledged that the
battle against illegal drugs will ``remain a key element of our
foreign policy agenda'' and that both he and Bush will ``raise this
issue with foreign leaders'' in the effort to reduce the supply of
drugs bound for the United States.
   Under law, the president is required to certify by March 1 that
countries where major drug trafficking occurs are ``fully
cooperating'' with the U.S. effort to stem the drug trade.
   Baker noted that of the 17 countries found to be cooperating with
the United States, six ``can and must do more in the future to end
the drug trade.''
   The include:
   _The Bahamas, which was praised for a combined law enforcement
operation with the United States, but was cited for possible
government corruption and urged to make ``stronger unilateral
efforts to curb drug trafficking and consumption.''
   _Bolivia, which was lauded for a ``good effort'' with its coca
eradication program. The administration expressed concern, however,
that more must be done.
   _Colombia, which was praised for ``strong action'' against
cocaine refining and resistance to violent drug traffickers. It was
noted, however, that the ``judiciary remains intimidated'' by the
drug traffickers and little prospect for their arrest exists.
   _Mexico, which was cited for President Carlos Salinas' ``strong
public stance'' against drugs, as well as the efforts of his new
deputy attorney general. But corruption was seen as a continuing
problem, and the nation remains the United States' top source for
heroin and its No. 2 source for marijuana.
   _Paraguay, which was praised for a ``stronger commitment'' in
1988, but was still termed a ``significant drug transit point and
money-laundering center.'' Former Gen. Alfredo Stroessner was ousted
by a military coup in February. Although reports have surfaced that
the new president, Andres Rodriguez, has links to the
drug-trafficking industry, the list says the department does ``not
yet know'' what type of actions will be taken by his government.
   _Peru, which was lauded for ``some real progress in anti-drug
programs,'' but was urged to adopt an even stronger crop control
effort.

<HEAD>Governors Urge Bush to Act on Acid Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of governors and former governors urged
the Bush adminstration Wednesday to propose acid rain legislation
that would reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by at least 10 million
tons by the end of this century.
   Such emission reductions are needed for the legislation ``to be
taken serously in the acid rain debate,'' Gov. Rudy Perpich of
Minnesota, one of the meeting participants, told a news conference.
   Perpich is the new chairman of the Alliance for Acid Rain
Control, a coalition of governors, industry representatives and
environmentalists working toward reducing acid rain, which is caused
largely by industrial pollution and emissions from coal-burning
power plants.
   But Perpich and Anthony Earl, former governor of Wisconsin, said
the meeting with Richard K. Reilly, head of the Environmental
Protection Agency, produced no firm commitment from Reilly on
specific pollution reductions the administration might seek.
   Nevertheless, said Perpich, ``we are optimistic that this is the
year for acid rain legislation'' and an end to ``years of acrimony
and deadlock on this issue.''
   President Bush has said that one of his top environmental
priorities is to submit to Congress legislation aimed at reducing
the industrial and other pollutants that cause acid rain.
Congressional leaders have said they expect to vote on an acid rain
bill by summer.
   But some of the governors expressed concern that federal
legislation might punish states that already have taken aggressive
action or producers of western, low-sulphur coal.
   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, who also participated in the meeting,
said that federal legislastion should include ``flexibility'' for
different states to meet the emission reductions.
   For example, the governors said, the coalition opposed a federal
requirement for utilities to install expensive ``scrubbers'' to
reduce sulphur emissions or for the federal government to provide
subsidies for the installation of such scrubbers.
   Perpich said the group told Reilly that requiring scrubbers
``will double the cost of cleanup, ... weaken political support in
the West and South and increase global warming problems'' because of
increased carbon dioxide emissions.
   The governor declined to provide specific provisions they would
want to see in federal acid rain legislation except to say that it
should require specific emission-reduction requirements.
   Whatever acid rain legislation emerges from Congress, its
provisions must be strictly enforced, Perpich said the group told
Reilly.
   ``If utilities don't reduce their pollution as the law requires,
they should pay stiff taxes based on the amount of pollution they
are releasing into the air. We need to make the punishment fit the
crime,'' he added.
   Among those who met with Reilly were Scott Matheson, former
governor of Utah; Hugh Carey, former governor of New York and now an
executive at W.R. Grace Co.; Ned Helme, executive director of the
Center for Clean Air Policy; and former Wisconsin Sen. Gaylord
Nelson, an official of the Wilderness Society.

<HEAD>Two Candidates Runnning For Most Parliament Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An average of two candidates will be running for
each seat when Soviets cast ballots for a new parliament on March
26, an election official said Wednesday.
   Some voting districts will still only have one candidate, but
others will have three or four, said Dmitry Golovko, deputy director
of the central electoral commission.
   The new parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, will have
2,250 members and will elect a Supreme Soviet from within its ranks
to act as a full-time, two-house legislative body.
   ``Two candidates will compete for one seat in nearly 1,000
constituencies, and more than 200 have registered three or more
candidates,'' Golovko said.
   The complex process of nominating candidates from 1,500 regional
election districts began in December and ended on Feb. 23 with the
registration of candidates with the central electoral commission.
   Candidates put forward by official organizations, such as the
Communist Party and large trade unions, were registered on Jan. 29
for the 750 seats allocated to them under the new election laws.
   Golovko said 80 percent of the candidates belonged to the
Communist Party, a percentage higher than in previous elections; 20
percent were women and nearly 40 percent were workers or farmers.
   ``The Soviet people are playing an active part in this campaign
and have sent more than 7,000 letters and suggestions to the central
electoral commission over the past three months,'' Golovko said.
   He said many letters suggested improvements in the new election
law, which has confused many voters. Golovko admitted the law had
``some imprecisions'' that need clarification.
   ``The commission will analyze the current election campaign and
submit suggestions to the Soviet parliament to improve the Soviet
electoral law,'' he said.
   If a candidate fails to win a 51 percent majority, a new election
will be held in that district within two weeks of the March 26
election, Golovko said.

   Police said Wednesday they are hunting for a couple
who allegedly lured their victims to hotel rooms, slipped
sleep-inducing drugs into their drinks and robbed them.
   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
investigators identified the suspects as Yousef Mahmoud Salim Abudl
Hawa, 48, of Jordan and Eilien Konga, 28, of Thailand.
   He said investigators had given photos of the pair to newspapers.
   The robberies using the sleep-inducing drugs have occurred in
metropolitan Tokyo since 1986, the official said.
   The Asahi Shimbun and other nationally circulated Japanese
newspapers said the equivalent of about $78,000 has been stolen in
26 ``dead sleep'' robberies.
   The Asahi said that in one case, a 58-year-old businessman
invited Konga into his hotel room in July 1987, only to have his
beer drugged and about $30,000 stolen from his wallet.

<HEAD>Oil Slick In Antarctica Grows, Weather Hampers Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PUNTA ARENAS, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An oil slick in Antarctica caused by a
Peruvian scientific ship that ran aground has grown to more than a
half-mile long, and rough weather has hampered cleanup efforts, the
navy reported Wednesday.
   It was the first indication that the slick from the Sunday
accident, the second in a month in the region, is more serious than
originally thought. In another report earlier Wednesday, the navy
called the oil spill ``minor.''
   Winds reaching up to 80 miles per hour prevented efforts to right
the 1,980-ton Humbolt and clean up the slick of diesel oil leaking
from two of the ship's fuel tanks, the navy said in a communique.
   Frogmen from the nearby Uruguayan and South Korean Antarctic
stations finally succeeded Wednesday in checking the vessel's hull
after stormy weather prevented them from doing so for two days.
   The communique did not describe the extent of the damage, but a
navy spokesman in Punta Arenas, 1,500 miles south of Santiago, said
the damage does not seem to be serious.
   The spokesman, Lt. Cristian Carbone, said authorities are
confident they will be able to float the Humboldt soon.
   The navy communique said a Chilean air force helicopter flew over
the Humboldt on Wednesday and its crew reported that the slick
expanded to more than a half-mile long and 150 feet wide.
   On Monday the Chilean navy reported the slick to be 450 feet long
and 15 feet wide.
   The navy had also said earlier that stormy weather in the area
has prevented the beginning of a clean-up operation.
   The Humboldt ran aground around midnight Sunday at the entrance
of Marion Cove, on King George Island. All 64 scientists and sailors
aboard were rescued unharmed by the British Royal Navy's ice patrol
ship Endurance.
   On Wednesday, however, a group of sailors were back on the ship
to start preparing the operation to float it, according to the navy
communique.
   A cutter from the Chilean navy, the Yelcho, was scheduled to
reach the Humboldt at dawn Thursday, carrying personnel and
equipment both for the floating operation and cleanup.
   On Jan. 28, a ship from the Argentine navy, the Bahia Paraiso
(Paradise Bay), ran aground 300 miles from the site of the Humboldt
accident, creating a major oil slick. The slick was eventually
cleaned up in an international operation that involved ships and
personnel from Argentina, Chile and the United States.

   President Bush should convene a conference on
homelessness because a coherent national strategy to deal with the
problem is urgently needed, said Sen. Albert Gore, who introduced
legislation Wednesday to authorize such a meeting.
   ``Now is the time for President Bush to show the leadership this
issue demands,'' said the Tennessee Democrat.
   Citing studies predicting 18 million Americans will be homeless
by the turn of the century if current policies continue, Gore said
``a coherent, long-range strategy is urgently needed.''
   ``This isn't the only answer, but it is an essential ingredient
to the comprehensive, effective policy we need,'' he added.
   Gore, an author of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance
Act, said he welcomed recent trips to shelters for the homeless b
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp. Bush has pledged
to provide the $682.8 million authorized by Congress in that
legislation.
   ``The White House conference we are proposing today can provide
substantive direction for their good intentions,'' Gore said.
   Gore's proposal for a White House conference would authorize
meetings and require a report to include specific recommendations
for executive and legislative action on homelessness within six
months after the sessions.
   Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, who accompanied Gore at a news
conference to announce the proposal, said the conference would be
``welcome news'' to local and state officials who have been
providing shelter for the homeless after cuts in the federal housing
budget during the Reagan administration.
   Flynn had testified earlier as head of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors Task Force on Hunger and Homelessness at a House
subcommitteee on housing and community development hearing which
focused on the need for permanent affordable housing for low- and
moderate-income people.
   Flynn told the panel he had proposed a White House conference to
Bush.
   ``If we are ever to turn around these national figures of growing
homelessness, we need national leadership that cares about these
festering problems,'' said Flynn in a written statement.

   William J. Bennett promised senators Wednesday
to shun the role of a mere figurehead in the national drug-fighting
job to which President Bush has nominated him.
   However, commenting at his confirmation hearing, Bennett
sidestepped questions on a substantive issue _ legislation to ban
military-style assault rifles sometimes used by drug pushers.
   ``Why would you take this job to be a figurehead?'' Bennett asked
the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``The pay is not so good; the hours
are horrible and the subject matter is depressing.''
   Lawmakers questioned the former secretary of education closely on
whether as head of the government's war on drug abuse he would be
willing and able to engage in vigorous political infighting with
Cabinet secretaries who might be protective of their own power and
prerogatives.
   He promised that he would speak out within administration
councils.
   ``I don't think lack of candor has been my problem,'' the
outspoken Bennett told the hearing, drawing laughter from the
audience.
   The tone was more somber, however, when Sens. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., asked Bennett if he would support legislation that would
outlaw semiautomatic weapons such as AK-47s and Uzis favored by drug
pushers.
   Kennedy also quoted a 1988 memo in which Bennett had proposed
considering efforts to outlaw ``automatic'' and certain other
weapons.
   The current dispute in Congress is over semiautomatic weapons. It
is still possible for private individuals to own fully automatic
weapons but only after meeting an array of difficult-to-fulfill
requirements.
   ``What logical or reasonable way is there for a citizen to own an
AK-47?'' Kennedy asked Bennett.
   ``That's a good question,'' Bennett replied.
   ``I'm waiting for an answer,'' Kennedy said.
   ``I'll give you one in six months,'' Bennett said.
   Bennett also told lawmakers there can be no quick victory in the
war against narcotics.
   ``It will take more than 180 days to turn the tide around,'' he
said.
   Opening the hearing, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he understood that it would take time to
get the job done and that there would be some failures along the way.
   Biden said if Bennett used the full powers of his office to
combat drug abuse, ``we will run all the political interference you
need,'' but if the effort ran out of steam, ``then you have a critic
sitting up here.''
   Bennett appeared a virtual shoo-in for approval by the panel,
with his sharpest critic, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., saying ``I think
I might be the only one to vote no.'' And even he left the door open
to voting in support of Bennett's nomination as director of the
Office of National Drug Policy.
   The office was created under wide-ranging crime legislation
approved last fall and requires the director to draw up a national
strategy aimed at coordinating the war on drugs.
   The opening of the hearing entailed little more than opening
statements and primarily afforded senators a chance to air their
special concerns as well as lap up a sizeable helping of the
attention that the drug issue always provides. Sen. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., told the panel that ``everybody likes to mess with it
because you get seven-camera (congressional) hearings out of it.''
   In two hours of welcoming remarks by about a dozen lawmakers,
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., put in a plug for a $10 billion
prison-construction idea, saying rehabilitation of crime-prone
addicts was important but if they ``become career criminals, you
have to throw away the key.''
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, sponsor of a bill to outlaw
sale of military-style assault rifles, warned Bennett not to ignore
the tie between drug abuse and the use of semiautomatic weapons by
criminals.
   The ceremonial comments dragged on so long that Sen. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., merely inserted his statement in the record,
saying, ``Two hours of welcoming remarks are about as stupefying as
some drugs.''
   Simon said he remained undecided about whether to support the
veteran federal official as drug czar, saying he had once voted with
enthusiasm to confirm Bennett as head of the National Endowment for
the Humanities.
   ``I was less enthusiastic at the end of your term,'' Simon said.
   ``If we were to elect a national gadfly on the drug issue, you
would get my vote very quickly,'' Simon said. ``The more troubling
question is whether you can be an effective administrator.''
   Simon said he also was disappointed by Bennett's performance as
secretary of education.
   ``I want from your office not a blizzard of press releases,''
Simon said. ``I want a solid job on what is really a massive problem
in our society.''
   Humphrey said Bennett's habit of using his Cabinet post as a
``bully pulpit'' to crusade for upgrading education might be
described ``as the activities of a gadfly, a term which I don't
share, but nonetheless it has importance.'' He hailed the nominee's
``solid record of accomplishment.''

   President Bush on Wednesday formally notified
Congress of the composition of the National Space Council
established in the White House to oversee and coordinate space
policy.
   As Bush had revealed in his Feb. 9 budget message and speech to
Congress, the 10-member council will be headed by Vice President Dan
Quayle.
   Other members of the council will include Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher and the secretary of defense.
   Bush still is fighting to get John Tower confirmed by the Senate
for the Pentagon post.
   Bush said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
president's assistant for science and technology will participate in
council meetings ``as appropriate.''
   The council, among other things, will review and recommend
modifications of national space policy.
   In his budget message to Congress, Bush said that is
administration ``is committed to an aggressive program to maintain
and press ahead with `the American edge' _ U.S. leadership in key
areas of space activity.''
   In that message, Bush proposed to increase funding in fiscal 1990
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration by $2.4
billion, or 22 percent over the figure for 1989.

<HEAD>Crew Member Recalls Horror and Heroism Of Flight 811</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Plane Emergency</HEAD>

   Heroism by both passengers and crew saved
countless lives during the ``unbelievable horror'' when a United
Airlines jet ripped open over the Pacific, spilling nine passengers
to their deaths, a crew member said.
   ``I felt like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz when her house gets
picked up and everything gets blown away,'' purser Sarah Shanahan
said in an interview in Wednesday's editions of the Honolulu
Star-Bulletin.
   ``We had some flight attendants who had to hang on to the first
class stairwell when it actually happened. And, by golly, it held.
It helped to protect the lives of at least three people that I know
of,'' said Shanahan, 42, who has worked for United for 21 years.
   Federal investigators suspect the forward cargo door on the
Boeing 747 jet, United's Flight 811 bound for Auckland, New Zealand,
popped open during the flight Friday, tearing a 10-by-20-foot hole
in the plane's fuselage. The plane carried 354 people, including 18
crew members.
   ``I instantly knew that we had a hole in the airplane,'' said
Shanahan. She said her first reaction was to find oxygen to keep
from passing out.
   Because of the damage, the plane's emergency oxygen system did
not activate, investigators said. Shanahan said she searched
desperately for an oxygen bottle, finally finding one and taking ``a
few real strong inhalations'' to regain her strength.
   ``Then I stopped and I collected my thoughts for just a second. I
realized that the plane was flying. It was not in an uncontrolled
rapid descent.''
   Capt. David M. Cronin flew the crippled jet 100 miles on two of
four engines, landing safely at Honolulu International Airport 25
minutes later. Twenty-seven people were injured, with only two still
hospitalized Wednesday.
   Shanahan said it was ``truly a miracle that there were not more
injuries to people from things flying around in the cabin. There
were ice buckets, racks of glasses, cartons of juice and bins of
things around.''
   The decompression of the plane took only a few seconds, and
during that time ``anything that wasn't nailed down moved,'' she
said.
   Shanahan said she inched her way forward and saw ``an incredible
amount of structural damage'' and that two or three crew members
were helping passengers.
   ``They were reassuring people. I could see them physically
touching arms. I don't know what they were saying because the noise
was so incredible you couldn't hear yourself think,'' Sanahan said.
   She started walking back through the cabin, telling passengers to
put on life vests and inflate one chamber. She said she tried using
the public address system but it was too noisy for it to be heard,
so she found a megaphone.
   Shanahan said she instructed the passengers to tighten their seat
belts, grab their ankles and ``stay down until you know we're back
on earth and we've stopped.''
   She said she found three young men and assigned them to help with
the evacuation upon landing, instructing them on how to open the
emergency exit and deploy the inflatable slide, making them repeat
the instructions back to her.
   She said she told them, ``This is a critical job. They will pile
up at the bottom of the slide. They will get badly injured. It is
vital that you stay there.''
   ``And they did. God bless them. They did,'' Shanahan said.
   When the captain announced that the plane was two minutes from
the end of the runway, ``people kept unfastening their seat belts
and standing up to look out the windows,'' she said. ``I'm sure that
they wanted the reassurance. They wanted to see those Honolulu city
lights.
   ``That's why I'm hoarse. I screamed for two minutes: `Grab your
ankles. Stay down, stay down, stay down,''' Shanahan said.
   ``It was the best landing. It was just perfect. It was smooth. It
was wonderful,'' she said.
   Once the plane stopped, Shanhan said she whipped open the door
and began ordering the passengers to form double lines and leap onto
the slide.
   Shanahan said she didn't know until she was off the plane that
passengers had been lost. It was only then that she saw the size of
the hole.

   Representatives of publishers and booksellers
met with the attorney general and FBI director Wednesday and said
they are now satisfied with the federal response to threats of
violence related to Salman Rushdie's book, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Thirteen publishing and bookselling executives met privately for
an hour at the Justice Department with Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and FBI Director William Sessions.
   Afterward, Lawrence Hughes, chairman of Hearst Trade Books Group
and the Association of American Publishers, said, ``I'm satisfied
they're fully committed to put whatever resources they can into
combating this terrorist threat.''
   Hughes, whose group represents 250 publishers who put out 75
percent of the nation's books, added that the executives had called
for the meeting because ``the response from the government had been
slow up to now. There was no immediate response to Ayatollah
Khomeini's death threat. It was quite a few days before anybody in
the government said anything.''
   On Tuesday, bombs exploded in two Berkeley, Calif., bookstores
and the offices of a weekly newspaper in New York. Afterward,
President Bush ordered the Justice Department to get involved.
   Justice spokesman Loye Miller said the FBI has opened a criminal
investigation of the three blasts.
   After the meeting, Thornburgh said, ``Every resource available
will be committed to ensure individuals and organizations in this
country will be protected in the exercise of their First Amendment
rights.''
   He said the group discussed how the FBI can gather intelligence
and how people outside government can help.
   Bernie Rath, executive director of the American Booksellers
Association, which represents owners of 7,000 bookstores, said
100,000 copies of the book will be shipped this weekend and ``only a
quarter-inch of plate glass will stand between the booksellers'
ideals and what's happening on the streets.''
   He predicted virtually all bookstores will sell the novel.
   Rath said he was satisfied with the federal response, which he
said included setting up a hotline for businesses to report threats.
``Maybe they can see patterns in the threats to help with the
intelligence effort,'' Rath said.
   He said threats numbered in the hundreds now, against people
involved in selling the book.
   Bush had previously spoken out against Khomeini's death threat
against Rushdie, who is British.

<HEAD>Greenpeace Attacks Britain on Ozone Layer Destruction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greenpeace accused Britain on Wednesday of being a
leading producer and exporter of the chemicals that are destroying
the ozone layer. The charge was made on the eve of a world
conference here on ozone problems.
   The environmental group said it obtained figures distributed only
to governments and industries indicating that Britain last year
produced 105,000 tons of chlorofluorocarbon gases and exported
48,146 tons.
   The compounds, widely used in refrigerator coolants, foam
insulation, fast-food packaging and propellants for aerosol spray
cans, are destroying the ozone layer _ the fragile atmospheric
shield that protects the Earth's surface from the sun's
cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   The compounds also contribute to the greenhouse effect, trapping
heat, gradually warming the Earth's surface and contributing to
potentially dangerous shifts in global weather patterns.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Wednesday her government
plans to require all new refrigerators to use safer solvents and all
new cars to take unleaded gasoline by 1990.
   She spoke in an interview for the British Broadcasting Corp.
television program ``Nature,'' to be broadcast Thursday.
   Britain has invited government ministers, industry leaders and
scientists to a three-day conference beginning Sunday to discuss
practical steps to reduce the problems. More than 110 countries have
accepted.
   Britain has vowed to reduce chloroflurocarbon emissions by 85
percent by 1999. An additional 30 countries have ratified the 1987
Montreal Protocol that calls for a 50 percent reduction by then.
   Greenpeace wants the compounds banned immediately.
   ``Some (chloroflurocarbons) have a life of at least 380 years, so
each one we produce adds to the potentially lethal legacy we are
leaving for 10 generations,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Steve
Elsworth.
   Greenpeace said annual world consumption of chloroflurocarbons is
estimated to be 1 million to 1.2 million tons. It said West Europe
and the United States accounted for 73.6 percent of production in
1984, and 70 percent of consumption in 1985.
   Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley told reporters Wednesday a
big demand remains worldwide for chloroflurocarbons and joint
international efforts are needed to reduce it.
   Greenpeace said no one has ever published a country-by-country
list of chloroflurocarbon producers containing precise production
figures.
   Lord Caithness, a junior environment minister, confirmed at a
briefing on the weekend conference that Britain is ``one of the
largest'' chloroflurocarbon producers, but added, ``America is more
of a bigger producer than us.''
   Greenpeace said a 1988 report written for the French Ministry of
the Environment lists the capacity of chloroflurocarbon plants
worldwide and estimated that European Economic Community plants
operated at 70 percent capacity on average. Britain is one of the 12
EEC members.
   By matching capacity with performance, Greenpeace said it arrived
at its production figures, showing that in 1984, the main producer
of chloroflurocarbons was the United States, with 455,000 tons or
37.4 percent of world production.
   It was followed by West Europe with 440,000 tons or 36.2 percent
of production; Japan with 150,000 tons or 12.4 percent; and
communist countries with 120,000 tons or 4.1 percent.
   Greenpeace said Britain has a production capacity of 150,000
tons, so if it operated last year at the 70 percent average, it
would have produced 105,000 tons.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears Appeal In Teen's Death Sentence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Imposing the death penalty on teen-ager Paula
Cooper, who admitted stabbing an elderly woman to death, violates
the Indiana and U.S. constitutions, her lawyers argued Wednesday.
   ``We do not say that Paula was not responsible for what she
did,'' defense attorney William L. Touchette told the Indiana
Supreme Court. ``What we are saying is that the death sentence in
this case violates the 8th Amendment to the Constitution, which
protects against cruel and unusual punishment.''
   Cooper pleaded guilty to murder in 1986 for the killing of Ruth
Elizabeth Pelke, a 78-year-old Bible teacher who was stabbed at
least 30 times with a butcher knife on May 14, 1985.
   Three other teen-agers from Gary, Ind., went to trial and were
convicted of murder in the case.
   Cooper, who was 15 at the time of the crime, was accused of
masterminding the robbery and killing Mrs. Pelke in her Gary home.
She is the youngest female in the United States to be sentenced to
death.
   Touchette argued that Lake Superior Court Judge James C.
Kimbrough failed to consider Cooper's abusive family environment as
a mitigating circumstance in the crime. If he had, the attorney
argued, it would have prohibited him from sentencing her to die in
the electric chair.
   However, Gary Secrest, a deputy attorney general, said the judge
did consider Cooper's family background, her age and her clean
record, but found that it did not weigh heavily enough to save her
from the death penalty.
   ``It's important to remember the brutality of the crime,''
Secrest said. ``It's important to remember that it was pre-planned
and pre-meditated.''
   At the time of Cooper's conviction, Indiana law allowed the
execution of anyone over age 10 convicted of murder. That age limit
has since been raised to 16, but was not made retroactive.
   Also attending the Supreme Court hearing was a delegation of
seven Italians representing the human-rights group ``Thou Shalt Not
Kill.''
   Cooper has becoome a popular cause in Italy for opponents of the
death penalty. Last June, members of Amnesty International submitted
petitions from nearly 2 million Italians who wanted then-Gov. Robert
Orr to commute her sentence.
   In Rome, about 100 protesters marched Wednesday night to the
office of the United Nations to support Cooper's appeal. The Rev.
Vito Bracone, a spokesman for the delegation that traveled to
Indiana, said about 400 of his countrymen were fasting and praying
for Cooper.
   The Italian delegation planned to visit Cooper, 19, at the
Indiana Women's Prison on Thursday before traveling to New York to
address the United Nations.
   ``Americans protest and pay money to save the whales, the eagles,
the wolves and other creatures,'' Bracone said at a news conference.
``Why don't you think it's worth it to rehabilitate a human being?''
   Also speaking at the news conference was William Pelke, 41, who
introduced himself as a ``grandson of Ruth Pelke and friend of Paula
Cooper.'' Pelke said he has written letters to Cooper and believes
she is remorseful for her crime.
   ``I have a deep love and compassion for Paula,'' Pelke said. ``My
grandmother was a Christian woman, and it was through her that I
learned love, prayer and forgiveness. I know that revenge is not the
answer.''
   The Supreme Court justices did not say how long it would take
them to reach a decision on the appeal.

<HEAD>New South African Law Will Allow Some Integrated Neighborhoods</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 39 years of mandatory
residential segregation, a new law took effect Wednesday that will
allow a few carefully selected multiracial neighborhoods.
   In a separate development, the government announced it has
commuted the death sentences of 16 prisoners, including an activist
who was the subject of clemency appeals from the United Nations.
   The government also agreed to release 50 detainees held without
charge, anti-apartheid church leaders said Wednesday following a
meeting with the Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok. The
churchmen said that will bring to 279 the number of releases Vlok
has authorized in the past two weeks.
   The government has hailed the legalization of integrated
neighborhoods as a milestone, but an opposition newspaper called it
a ``half-baked'' plan that will create a few overcrowded multiracial
areas while segregation prevails elsewhere.
   Most observers expect that multiracial neighborhoods will be
limited to a handful of new housing developments and to inner-city
neighborhoods that already have become integrated despite
segregation laws.
   Decisions on establishing integrated neighborhoods will be made
by an eight-member board dominated by government supporters. One
member is black.
   The board is supposed to take community sentiment into
consideration, and the government has made clear that no white
neighborhoods will be integrated if there is significant opposition.
   ``This act does not change the present living and residential
patterns of our communities,'' Acting President Chris Heunis said
last week. ``But it gives those people who wish to associate freely
with one another the democratic choice to do so.''
   Heunis is filling in for President P.W. Botha, who is
recuperating from a stroke.
   The Star, a liberal Johannesburg newspaper with the country's
largest daily circulation, acknowledged that the act will allow
people of different races to live together legally for the first
time since residential segregation was mandated by the Group Areas
Act in 1950.
   ``Yet it does this in such a half-baked and limited way that it
is likely to aggravate, not alleviate, slum conditions,'' said The
Star in an editorial Tuesday.
   It predicted that a handful of ``free settlement'' areas will
rapidly become overcrowded, leading to problems that the government
will blame on integration.
   The 16 prisoners who had their death sentences commuted included
one man of mixed-race and 15 blacks, among them Paul Setlaba,
convicted of committing murder during a 1985 black consumer boycott.
   The Justice Ministry gave no explanation for the action, merely
listing the prisoners granted clemency. In each case, the death
sentence was commuted to a prison term, ranging from 10 years to
life.
   Setlaba's planned execution was stayed by Justice Minister Kobie
Coetsee in November, hours before he was to be hanged. The stay
followed appeals for clemency by human rights groups in South Africa
and by the U.N. Security Council, which depicted Setlaba as an
anti-apartheid activist caught up in political unrest.
   Details of the other reprieved prisoners' cases were not
disclosed.
   The release of 50 prisoners held without charge came in response
to a series of hunger strikes by up to 400 inmates in South Africa.
Vlok ``gave the delegation his assurance that ... the process of
releasing detainees would continue,'' church leaders said in a
statement.

<HEAD>Administration Says Industrial Nations Must Pursue Non-Inflationary
Growth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial nations must pursue non-inflationary
economic growth to stimulate world trade and provide growing markets
for their own exports and those of less-developed countries, the
Bush administration said Wednesday in a report to Congress.
   The report from the Treasury Department and the Office of the
U.S. Trade Representative said the United States and its major
trading partners were committed to making the changes needed to
reduce imbalances in world trade.
   Germany and Japan, both countries with large trade surpluses,
need to take steps to ensure open and growing domestic markets, the
report said.
   The United States, meanwhile, ``is committed to substantial
federal budget deficit reductions, improving its international
competitiveness, and bolstering its savings rate,'' it said.
   The report noted that most economies are structured in ways that
can hinder international efforts to coordinate monetary, fiscal and
exchange rate policies to promote world trade.
   It said the industrial nations agreed at the Toronto economic
summit last year to pursue specific reforms that would reduce such
barriers through steps such as cutting subsidies that impede the
international flow of resources, reforming tax systems that
discourage innovation, and reducing burdensome regulations.
   Such a course ``is well suited to producing medium-term solutions
to what are, after all, medium-term problems,'' the report said.
   The report projected that without policy changes, Japan's trade
surplus in goods and services would drop ``significantly'' in the
next two years from about $80 billion this year, while Germany, with
export growth rebounding, would see its overall surplus largely
unchanged.
   England's ballooning of its trade deficit in 1988 is unlikely to
be reversed, and France, Italy and Canada should collectively have
about the same deficit in 1990 that they did in 1988, it said.
   The United States, meanwhile, expects to see increases in exports
exceed growth in imports, although rising payments on the national
debt will hold back the overall reductions in the trade deficit.
   The U.S. trade deficit in 1988 posted its first improvement since
1980, narrowing to $137.34 billion from an all-time high of $170.32
billion in 1987.
   The report said less-developed countries also must move to
promote world trade. These countries, especially those that are
heavily in debt, must adopt policies that support domestic growth,
reduce inflation, and encourage support from banks and international
financial institutions, it said.
   The trade projection report was required under the Omnibus Trade
Act of 1988.

   Islamic flags flew over Israeli Arab cities
Wednesday as Moslem fundamentalists celebrated their victories in
municipal elections, the results of which have frightened many Jews.
   The Islamic Movement, competing for the first time in Tuesday's
balloting, emerged as a growing influence among the 400,000 eligible
Arab voters in Israel.
   The movement challenged the Communist Party, the traditional
dominant force in Arab municipalities, and scored a landslide
victory in Umm El Fahem, the second-largest Arab town.
   It also took over the three smaller cities of Kafr Kassim, Kafr
Bara and Kafr Kana, and won seats in four other city councils _
including six seats of the 19-member council in the town of
Nazareth, often called ``red Nazareth'' because of its Communist
affiliation.
   Although Jewish leaders expressed fears that the results
indicated growing extremism in the Arab sector, Arab analysts said
the Islamic movement had won because it provided badly needed
municipal services.
   Lutfy Mashour, editor of the Arabic-language Sinara newspaper in
Nazareth, said the Islamic victory was not ``a matter of religion,
it's a matter of services.''
   In Umm El Fahem, Sheikh Raed Salah Mahajneh, a bearded,
30-year-old preacher, won more than 72 percent of the vote, or 11 of
15 seats on the city council, defeating the town's Communist mayor.
   ``Islam will sweep the world,'' a triumphant aide at Mahajneh's
office said. ``We in Umm el Fahem take the best from the Communists
and the best from the capitalists. This is Islam.''
   Flags of Islam, traditionally green, flew over the Galilee city
of over 20,000 and jubilant residents circled through town in their
cars plastered with green party stickers, creating a huge traffic
jam.
   The fundamentalist victories alarmed Israeli Jewish leaders of
virtually all parties.
   ``The Islamic Movement's aim is to gain leadership in (Israel's)
Arab sector. It's a very worrisome sign,'' said Interior Minister
Arye Deri of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party.
   Uzi Baram of the left-leaning Labor party said he preferred the
Communist Party, which ``at least grants legitimacy to the state of
Israel and sees itself as part of it.
   ``The Islamic Movement is a dangerous movement,'' he said on
Israel television.
   The Islamic Movement's leader, Sheikh Abdallah Nimer Darwish,
said his party would abide by the law and would not harm the state
of Israel ``by word or by deed.''
   Arab analysts said the movement gained its power by providing
services to the population.
   ``It's a local issue,'' said Hashem Abdel Rachman, a spokesman
for the Islamic movement. ``People saw that the Islamic Movement
gave them good services and voted according to what they saw.''
   Analysts said it took the movement about five years of building
schools and running volunteer camps to win over Umm El Fahem, which
an Arab reporter described as ``easily the worst slum in Israel.''
Many roads in the city are not paved and there are serious sewage
problems.

   Ben Johnson's track coach testified Wednesday that
he turned the Canadian sprinter on to steroids in 1981 because their
use was necessary to keep up with the competition.
   Johnson won the gold medal and set a world record in the
100-meter race at the Summer Olympics in Seoul last year, but was
stripped of both after he tested positive for steroid use. Johnson
has maintained that he never knowingly used drugs to enhance his
performance.
   But Charlie Francis, who has been Johnson's coach since 1977,
told a Canadian inquiry into drugs and sports that he put Johnson on
a steroid program in 1981.
   Francis said he first approached Johnson about steroids that
summer, but Johnson ``was not sure of the advantages.'' That fall,
Francis said, Johnson ``decided he would go on.''
   ``If he wanted to compete, it's pretty clear that steroids are
worth a meter at the highest level of sports,'' Francis said. ``I
think he understood that his competitors were on them.''
   Francis' only previous statement since the Olympics was that the
sprinter's urine test may have been sabotaged.
   Francis said that top-level international competition is
virtually impossible without steroids. He cautioned against
believing any claims from top-level athletes that they are clean and
that their records are the result only of hard work.
   ``It just isn't true, not at the highest level,'' Francis said.
He said repeatedly that steroids ``are not a short cut'' but the
reason top-level athletes are able to train as hard as they do.

   A hopelessly deadlocked National Economic
Commission, failing to reach a grand compromise to solve the
nation's fiscal problems, issued a final report Wednesday that split
essentially along party lines.
   The commission's seven Republicans and the one Democrat appointed
by President Bush endorsed the president's 1990 fiscal budget,
calling it a ``workable plan for eliminating the deficit'' without
resorting to higher taxes.
   But the commission's six Democrats refused to go along with the
majority report and instead issued a minority document which
castigated Bush's $1.16 trillion budget, charging that it employed
unrealistic economic assumptions and failed to distribute the pain
of deficit reduction equally among different segments of society.
   The Bush budget ``rules out any discussion of additional revenues
and relies heavily on hard and disproportionate reductions in
domestic spending, many of which have been rejected repeatedly by
the Congress and the American people,'' the Democrats wrote.
   However, the Democrats did not offer their own plan for dealing
with the deficit and they did not specifically endorse higher taxes,
although many of them have stated the need for higher revenues.
   The 14-member commission, which now goes out of existence, was
labeled a huge disappointment by supporters, who once believed it
offered the best hope in the early days of a new administration of
crafting a workable compromise of spending cuts and tax increases
that would balance the government's books.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said the
commission could have offered ``political cover'' for both Congress
and the Bush administration to make the hard choices needed to solve
the deficit problem.
   However, ``with little support or leadership from the president
or Congress, the commission was unable to face up to the difficult
issues. It had no choice but to punt,'' Panetta said.
   Commission member Rep. William Gray III, D-Pa., and a former
House Budget Committee chairman, blamed partisanship by Republicans
for the group's failure to succeed.
   ``The president didn't want a bipartisan deficit reduction plan.
He wanted his own plan, the flexible freeze, and he insisted on it
from Republican members,'' Gray said. ``Instead of something bold
that could have moved us forward, we end up leaving it to Congress
and the administration to continue the fight.''
   Both Democratic Co-Chairman Robert Strauss and Republican
Co-Chairman Drew Lewis said they were disappointed that the
commission failed to come up with a solution to the deficit dilemma.
   While Strauss blamed the stalemate on Bush's intransigence on the
tax question, Lewis said that the panel's work had also been made
more difficult by a court suit brought by several news organizations
which forced the panel to hold all of its meetings in open session.
   ``It was virtually impossible to meet as a bipartisan group and
really hash out the tough issues with the press there,'' he said.
   Not everyone was disappointed with the outcome. Commission member
Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation and
one of the most outspoken opponents of tax increases, said the
majority report reflected the ``will of taxpayers throughout the
nation'' who had ``clearly indicated opposition to higher taxes and
irresponsible spending.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the commission ``did the best they could.'' He said that specific
suggestions made in the majority report for reforming the budget
process were ``very useful.''
   Bush had been openly critical of the commission during the
presidential campaign, saying if elected he would reject any report
which called for higher taxes. The panel, which was created by
Congress in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash, had the
backing of Bush's Republican primary opponent, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Both reports called for budget surpluses in future years to build
up surpluses needed to cover the retirement of the ``Baby Boom''
generation.
   The Republican report offered a detailed list of suggestions for
reforming the budget process, including a constitutional
balanced-budget amendment, presidential line-item veto authority and
greater involvement of the executive branch in the congressional
budget process. Many of the ideas were long championed by Ronald
Reagan and have also been endorsed by Bush.
   The Republican report also recommended a two-year budget process,
replacing the House and Senate Budget Committees with a joint panel
and basing budget decisions on actual spending in the current year
rather than projected spending levels for the next fiscal year.
   Bush appointed the final two members in December, former Sen.
Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., and longtime friend Thomas ``Lud'' Ashley, a
former Democratic congressman from Ohio who joined the Republicans
in endorsing the majority report. But he decided against extending
the panel's March 1 reporting deadline for another six months, a
step many on the panel had urged as a way of keeping the commission
alive in the hopes that it eventually could reach a consensus.
   That decision basically sealed the panel's fate and with only a
few weeks remaining, the panel abandoned efforts for any compromise
and began drafting majority and minority reports.
   Republicans who joined Ashley in signing the majority report were
Lewis, Kleckner, Laxalt and Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.; Rep. Bill
Frenzel, R-Minn., and former defense secretaries Caspar Weinberger
and Donald Rumsfeld.
   Democrats signing the minority report were Strauss, Sen. Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., Gray and Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca;
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and New York investment banker Felix
Rohatyn.

   U.S. immigration agents apprehended 27
more suspected illegal aliens Wednesday on a flight bound for New
York City, bringing to 175 the number detained in a three-day
government crackdown.
   INS agents, acting on a tip from a regular commuter on the
Piedmont Airlines flight, were waiting for the 25 males and two
females shortly before 7 a.m. during a stopover at Charlotte-Douglas
International Airport.
   The group on the flight, which originated in Phoenix, included
two Mexicans, eight Brazilians, 14 El Salvadorans and three
Ecuadorans, said Tom Thomas, an INS spokesman.
   By 4 p.m., the detainees taken off the jetliner had been
interviewed, fingerprinted, photographed and put on a bus for an
Immigration and Naturalization Service processing center near
Brownsville, Texas.
   The bust was part of a three-day crackdown against alien
smuggling rings that netted 175 suspected illegal aliens in
Charlotte, Atlanta and Los Angeles, authorities said.
   None of the aliens spoke English. Most of them spent the day
sleeping off the effects of their long ordeal, which began Monday
night in Los Angeles.
   According to the INS, the aliens boarded America West Airlines
flight 1277 in Los Angeles at 10 p.m. Monday night bound for
Phoenix. There, they boarded Piedmont flight 1522 bound for New York
City, with a stopover in Charlotte.
   On Monday, 79 suspected illegal aliens were apprehended aboard an
Eastern Airlines flight, also bound for New York, during a stopover
in Atlanta. The same day, 69 others were taken into custody as they
tried to board the same flight in Los Angeles.
   David Carmichael, an INS agent in Charlotte, said his agency was
alerted by a regular commuter on the Piedmont flight who had seen
television news reports of Monday's apprehensions _ which also had
stemmed from a commuter's tip.
   ``The source told us he had taken the same flight on February
15th and he noticed 30 to 40 people who looked to him like the same
people he saw on the news,'' Carmichael said.
   Donald Young of the INS's Charlotte office said one airline
official told him Wednesday that smuggling rings have been moving as
many as 30 aliens on the same Piedmont flight three times a week for
the past several months.
   ``The publicity we get out of this might cause it to dry up for
awhile, and force them to change their tactics,'' Young said. ``But
this isn't going to stop these people from coming into the country
looking for work.''
   Carmichael said authorities were trying to determine whether any
of the 27 taken into custody in Charlotte were part of the smuggling
ring.
   ``We're talking to a couple of them more than some of the
others,'' he said. ``For example, one had six airline tickets in his
possession when we took him into custody.''
   Illegal aliens pay smugglers as much as $4,000 apiece to get them
into the United States and to a place where they can find work.
``The arrangements are usually made before they ever leave home,''
Carmichael said.
   Thomas, who works out of the INS office in Atlanta, said the
aliens would be given the opportunity to have a hearing before a
deportation judge in Texas or choose to voluntarily leave the
country.
   ``Most of them will be deported in a week or so,'' he said.
Thomas said the smuggling rings have been around for years but only
recently have INS officials found large groups of aliens booked on
airline flights.
   Wednesday's operation was not the first time that illegal aliens
have been removed from the same Piedmont flight, Thomas said.
   On Oct. 6, 15 aliens were removed from the flight at the
Charlotte airport. Six days later, 17 more were seized, he said.
``The unique thing about this is that they are now flying in such
large numbers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Assault Law Takes Effect, Gun Owners Confused</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military style assault weapons and
short-barreled shotguns became illegal here Wednesday under a
disputed law that critics say has turned thousands of citizens into
lawbreakers.
   The ban in the nation's second largest city, which took effect at
midnight Tuesday, was driven by public outrage over street-gang
warfare waged with military arms and by the Jan. 17 slaying of five
schoolchildren in Stockton, Calif.
   The Stockton killer, Patrick Purdy, used an AKM-47 assault rifle,
a semiautomatic version of the gun used around the world by Soviet
bloc troops, to gun down the children. He then killed himself with
another weapon.
   On Tuesday, Albert Edward Gulart Jr., 20, Purdy's half-brother,
was arrested on weapons charges after his home was staked out by
officers who had questioned him following the schoolyard killings.
   Police seized a semiautomatic 9mm Ingram MAC-10 machine pistol,
an M-1 carbine, ammunition, artillery shells, blasting caps and
other explosives from Gulart's home in Modesto, Calif., about 300
miles north of Los Angeles.
   Los Angeles police have said they will not actively look for
owners of guns defined as illegal under the city's new law and by
midday Wednesday there had been no arrests reported as a result of
the new misdemeanor offense.
   Gun shop owners, aided by the National Rifle Association, have
challenged gun laws imposed in Los Angeles and Stockton.
   Gun owners were left confused by the possibility that the law
they might be violating could be overturned or displaced by a state
law.
   ``It puts the gun collector or owner in an awkward civic and
economic position,'' said local gun owner Steve Levine. ``There
could be a considerable investment involved. There has been no
compensation addressed in the law. They're just telling people you
have to get rid of them.''
   Deputy City Attorney Byron Boeckman suggested owners of the
illegal weapons ``not take them outside of their homes except to
take them to the Los Angeles Police Department.'' He recommended
that gun owners ask officers to keep custody of the weapons until
the issue is decided in court.
   The NRA challenge filed with the state Supreme Court contends
that the state rather than local government has the right to
legislate gun ownership.
   Boeckman said the state has failed to show a clear intent to
regulate assault rifles, leaving it open for local legislation.
   Even as those arguments were put forward, the Assembly Public
Safety Committee approved a ban on the sale of two dozen specified
assault weapons, including the AK-47. Later, the Senate Judiciary
Committee narrowly approved a broader bill.
   Both bills would allow anyone who lawfully possesses assault
weapons before Oct. 1, 1989, to keep them by registering them with
the Department of Justice. Both bills went fiscal committees, the
last stop before the floors in each house.
   Richard Gardiner, assistant general counsel for the NRA, said the
organization was contacting lawmakers to lobby against the
legislation.
   Gardiner said the Los Angeles ordinance probably has affected
``hundreds of thousands'' of gun owners in the city.
   The Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 Tuesday not to
ban semiautomatic weapons within the county's unincorporated areas.
However, the board voted to support a statewide ban of such weapons.
   The ban in the city of Los Angeles, approved by the City Council
in February, makes it a misdemeanor to own a semiautomatic gun.
Sales of the guns within city limits became illegal immediately
after passage of the ordinance.
   The measure bans semiautomatic rifles and carbines with a
capacity of 20 rounds or more and short-barreled shotguns that hold
six rounds or more. Banned by name are the Uzi, AK-47, AKM-47,
AR-15, Ingram MAC-10 and MAC-11.

   Thousands of people demonstrating
against ethnic Albanians massed outside Parliament on Wednesday
while a senior official inside told lawmakers ethnic violence
threatens to tear Yugoslavia apart.
   Lazar Mojsov, a member of the ruling 12-man state presidency,
also charged that an illegal group of ethnic Albanians has detailed
plans to disrupt southern Kosovo province, the state-run news agency
Tanjug said.
   ``The integrity of Yugoslavia is jeopardized to the extreme
degree,'' Mojsov said in comments carried on Belgrade radio.
   The government indefinitely extended a ban on all public
gatherings in Kosovo, Tanjug said, following more than a week of
widespread unrest in the province.
   Outside Parliament, about 4,000 members of the Serb and
Montenegrin minority from Kosovo blocked streets and chanted songs
to protest alleged persecution in the province by Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of Kosovo's estimated 2 million people.
   Mojsov told the assembly 50,000 Slavs emigrated from Kosovo since
1981 because of harassment.
   The flag-carrying protesters were joined by at least 10,000
Belgrade sympathizers. On Tuesday, a Belgrade rally led by Serbian
Communist Party boss Slobodan Milosevic drew an estimated 500,000
people.
   Taxi drivers, carrying large portraits of Milosevic on their
cars, provided free transportation for the elderly.
   The mainly Christian Serbs believe the predominantly Moslem
Albanians in Kosovo, which was ancient Serbia's heartland, want to
unite the province with neighboring Albania. The ethnic Albanians
have demanded that Kosovo's autonomy not be restricted.
   Growing ethnic nationalism and an economic crisis have created
the greatest threat to Yugoslav unity since the 1980 death of
President Tito, whose leadership held the loose confederation of six
republics and two provinces together. The country's 23 million
citizens belong to a number of different nationalities and religions.
   Mojsov said the presidency has retrieved a document signed by
members of ``an illegal Kosovo group,'' detailing plans for
destabilizing the province, according to Tanjug.
   The plan's initial stage reportedly called for ``passive strikes
in factories, firms, schools and universities'' and other actions,
which Mojsov said were ``carried out in full'' last week.
   The Parliament met to discuss the deteriorating security in the
country following the Kosovo protests and counterdemonstrations by
angry Serbs in Belgrade and other parts of Serbia.
   Frontier controls have been tightened to ``prevent the bringing
in of explosives, arms, ammunition, hostile propaganda material and
illegal crossings of the country's borders,'' Vice Premier Janez
Zemljaric told Parliament.
   A ban on gatherings in Kosovo was introduced in November when up
to 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in Kosovo's capital
Pristina against the forced resignations of some top ethnic Albanian
provincial leaders as demanded by Serbia.
   The ban, as extended Wednesday, also prohibits massive arrivals
in the province. This was apparently designed to prevent Serbs from
converging on Kosovo.
   The protesting Serbs and Montenegrins walked from the railroad
station to Parliament, jamming streets and interrupting traffic as
Belgrade residents cheered them.
   At the station they were greeted by the Belgrade theological
seminary students choir, which sang Serbian Orthodox songs, banned
until recently but now freely performed.
   Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, was peaceful Wednesday. More
police, military personnel and army vehicles were seen in the area.
   Zemljaric said that 23,500 people in essential services in the
provinces were ordered back to work.
   About 500 ethnic Albanians in the Trepca lead-zinc mine in Kosovo
continued their strike to protest Serbian plans to change
constitutional provisions in a bid to win greater control over the
province.
   On Monday, about 1,300 ethnic Albanian miners at Trepca left the
pits after their eight-day sit-in forced the resignation of three
Kosovo party leaders whom they consider pro-Serbian.
   Both Croatia and Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most
economically-advanced republics, support the ethnic Albanian's
demands for guarantees that autonomy of their province will not be
limited.

   A unarmed federal drug agent shot to death in an
undercover operation was wearing a radio transmitter and had five
backup men, but they lost contact as he drove off with the man
suspected of killing him, officials said Wednesday.
   The murder of undercover Special Agent Everette Hatcher on
Tuesday was the first killing of a Drug Enforcement Administration
officer in the New York area since 1972, said DEA spokesman Robert
Strang.
   The DEA, FBI and police issued an all-points bulletin for
Constible ``Gus'' Farace, 28, of Staten Island.
   Farace was released from the Elmira Correction Facility in June
1988 after serving eight years for the 1979 kidnapping and murder of
a New Jersey teen-ager, said police sources who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said he would seek the death penalty
under the new federal drug bill when Hatcher's killer is caught.
   Investigators do not believe Hatcher's ``cover was blown or that
he was known to be a law enforcement officer,'' said William Y.
Doran, special agent in charge of the FBI's Criminal Division.
   ``This was not a `buy and bust' situation. There were no drugs
present. There was no money present,'' Doran said. ``The killing was
out of cold-bloodedness as far as we can determine.''
   He said Hatcher's wire had not been disturbed.
   Hatcher was found slumped over the wheel of an unmarked car on a
dead-end street on Staten Island at 10:15 p.m. Tuesday, shot four
times in the head and upper body, apparently from outside the car,
authorities said.
   Shortly after 9 p.m., Hatcher notified his back-up team that he
and Farace were going to drive their cars to a diner, said Robert
Stutman, special agent in charge of the DEA's New York City bureau.
   ``Shortly after that they (the agents) lost contact with the
transmitter,'' Stutman said. He said they had dropped back so as not
to be spotted and there was considerable traffic.
   The back-up team lost sight of Hatcher and began looking for the
agent, without success, at various diners on the boulevard until
returning to the original meeting area and finding Hatcher's car.
   Hatcher, 46, had worked at the New York office since joining the
DEA in 1972. At the time of his death, the agent was part of a joint
DEA-FBI Task Force engaged in a long-term drug investigation,
officials said.
   Two other DEA agents have been shot and wounded in New York City
in the last six months, but none has been killed in the New York
area since October 12, 1972, when Special Agent Frank Tummillo was
shot in a midtown hotel.
   Tummillo's partner, Supervisory Agent Thomas J. Devine, died
Sept. 25, 1982, of wounds he suffered during the 1972 shooting,
Strang said.

   It isn't easy adopting smoking
restrictions in the heart of tobacco country, as the University of
Louisville discovered when it tried to put a stringent smoking
policy into effect last fall.
   But it is possible, and new regulations went into effect
Wednesday that try to give campus smokers and non-smokers equal
rights to puff and not be puffed upon.
   ``I hope that this is an issue that we can put behind us,'' said
Dan Hall, a university official who met twice with the Kentucky
General Assembly's Tobacco Task Force to iron out details that
didn't set well with lawmakers representing Kentucky burley
producers.
   ``It's a hard issue for anybody who lives in a tobacco state,''
said Justine Speer, dean of the university's School of Nursing.
   The revised regulations, approved by University President Donald
Swain last month, did away with an especially controversial
provision in the original regulations that would have favored
non-smokers in disputes with smokers.
   After the first draft drew fire last November, some lawmakers
threatened to cut the university's budget.
   But in December, the university agreed to rewrite portions of the
policy to make sure smokers and non-smokers would be treated
evenhandedly.
   Under the revision, department heads will discuss and settle
conflicts over smoking with employees and their supervisors.
   ``The university feels that it's been responsive to the concerns
of many of the legislators in those two meetings, and my hope is
that it will be received as such,'' Hall said.
   The new policy bans smoking in classrooms and elevators, as did
the early proposal, but calls for more modest restrictions in
hallways, lounges and other public areas, where smoking will be
allowed in designated areas.
   Hall said the rules would be introduced gradually as signs are
printed and posted designating the smoking and non-smoking areas.
   Ms. Speer said nursing students and faculty worked out their own
smoking policy several months ago, before the issue surfaced
campus-wide.
   Nursing faculty members _ none of whom smoke _ and students voted
not to smoke in halls outside classrooms, Ms. Speer said. Smoking is
also prohibited inside classrooms.
   The nursing students' lounge is divided for smokers and
non-smokers, and staff members have separate lounges, she said.
   Although the school is sensitive to the issues of tobacco
farmers, it also wants to provide a ``healthful environment'' to
non-smokers, she said.
   ``There are very few people in our area who smoke anymore,'' she
said. ``It's just like people have learned.''

   John Tower has 36 firm Republican votes in
favor of confirming him as defense secretary with 36 Democrats
committed in opposition and 27 senators describing themselves as
uncommitted, according to an Associated Press survey.
   The uncommitted senators include 19 Democrats and eight
Republicans.
   When the tally is altered to reflect senators who are leaning
either for or against the nomination, but not firmly committed, the
result is 42-39 against Tower.
   That count includes Republican Larry Pressler of South Dakota
against Tower, the only Republican counted as a possible vote
against confirmation. No Democrats are considered leaning in favor
of a ``yes'' vote.
   One senator, Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, refused to reply to the
survey even though a spokesman said he has made up his mind.
   Confirmation requires a simple majority. Democrats hold a 55-45
majority in the Senate, so Tower would need to hold all Republicans
and gain five Democrats to give Vice President Dan Quayle a chance
to cast the tie-breaking vote for his confirmation.
   Here, in alphabetical order, is the vote count as of Wednesday on
the Tower nomination.
   A ``Y'' is a vote for Tower, an ``N'' against him and a ``U'' is

   John Tower, his nomination as defense secretary
in grave trouble, made an extraordinary public admission of marital
infidelity Wednesday but vowed to keep fighting for Senate
confirmation. His prospects dimmed further, however, by the Senate
majority leader's opposition.
   President Bush continued to court Democrats in a last-ditch
effort to save the appointment, and spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
asserted, ``We'll just keep up the good fight.''
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell further dampened
Tower's chances by declaring his opposition, even as Vice President
Dan Quayle conceded the administration still lacks the votes needed
for Senate approval.
   The president said his appeal to senators has been, ``Look, do
what you've got to do, but remember fair play, remember decency and
honor and then remember also historically the concept of advise and
consent where reasonable doubt is given historically to the
president of the United States who after all is responsible for the
executive branch of this government.''
   Bush dispatched Quayle to Capitol Hill to lobby for the
nomination.
   ``We hope the prospects improve. We don't have 50 votes yet. But
we're moving in that direction,'' Quayle told a White House photo
session.
   The White House effort failed with at least one conservative
Democrat, Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, who announced his opposition
to the nomination and urged Tower to withdraw. Boren was one of two
Democrats to vote for former President Reagan's unpopular Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who had been invited to a White House
session with Bush, declared his opposition, saying Tower ``is just
not the right person for the position of secretary of defense.''
   Mitchell announced that floor debate on the nomination had been
postponed until Thursday as the ranking members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va., met
with White House counsel C. Boyden Gray to decide what material from
the FBI report could be made public.
   Tower showed flashes of grit and humor as he fielded questions at
the National Press Club about allegations concerning excessive
drinking, womanizing and lucrative consulting fees he received from
defense contractors.
   Asked whether he would ask that his name be withdrawn, he replied
by quoting from the last letter written by Col. William Barrett
Travis, the leader of the Texans who fought and died at the Alamo:
``I shall never surrender or retreat.''
   The former Texas senator paused briefly and said, ``I am a little
sorry I brought up the Alamo analogy. It just occurred to me what
happened at the Alamo just 10 days after Travis wrote that letter.''
Texas defenders were wiped out by the Mexicans.
   Tower said he regards his weekend vow to quit drinking if he wins
confirmation as ``sacred ... and I can assure you I will abide by
it.''
   His speech addressed defense policy issues, matters Tower said
``normally occupy the mind of the nominee of secretary of defense.''
But he unflinchingly fielded questions from his audience about his
personal behavior.
   Asked whether he had ever broken his wedding vows, the
twice-divorced Tower said, ``As a matter of fact, I have broken
wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone in that connection.''
   Tower's second wife, Lilla Burt Cummings, alleged ``marital
misconduct'' in court papers in the couple's divorce case.
   But later Wednesday, Tower aides released a statement clarifying
his admission of marital infidelity, and administration sources
indicated Tower was referring to his first marriage, not his second.
   The statement noted that Tower, in his opening testimony before
the Senate Armed Services Committee, repeatedly stated that he had
never been unfaithful to his second wife.
   ``The senator stands by his statement, and he notes that marriage
vows have to do with a great deal more than the question of
infidelity,'' the statement said. ``However, the senator's oath and
pledge to the American people is of the same character as is the
oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States; an
oath he has never broken.''
   Administration sources, who insisted on anonymity, elaborated by
disclosing the Senate Armed Services Committee had been told that
Tower was divorced from his first wife, Lou, because of an
adulterous affair with the woman who became his second wife.
   There was no letup, meanwhile, in the political storm surrounding
the nomination.
   The administration is trying to hold all 45 Republicans and sway
five of the Senate's 55 Democrats to get a tie vote that Quayle
could break in favor of Tower.
   An Associated Press survey of the Senate found 36 Republicans
supporting the nomination, 36 Democrats opposed and 27 other
senators undecided or undeclared. One senator was unavailable for
comment.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, the Democratic leader, announced his
opposition to the nomination in a midday speech on the Senate floor,
citing Tower's ties to defense consultants and his drinking.
   Mitchell's position was widely anticipated, particularly since
all Democrats who have expressed an opinion on the nomination have
opposed it, and almost all Republicans have endorsed it.
   Turning to the controversy over Tower's personal conduct,
Mitchell told his colleagues that ``it is not moral perfection or
the qualifications of senators that are at issue here. It is the
ability to serve effectively in a position of unique power and
responsibility.''
   Mitchell said he read the FBI report on Tower and met with Bush
at the White House where he expressed his concerns about the
nomination.
   ``It is only after careful study of this record that I have
concluded that John Tower is not the man to provide leadership by
example to the military and civilian employees of the Department of
Defense, especially in the difficult job of reforming the Pentagon's
administration and procurement practices in a period of budget
stringency,'' Mitchell said.
   Tower lashed out at what he said was the absence of clearly
defined standards against which he was being judged. He noted that
several senators have said that the secretary of defense, as the
commander of U.S. military forces behind only the president, must
adhere to a higher standard. ``I accept that ... but my question is
how much,'' he said.
   He then asked whether it is ``acceptable for members late in the
evening who had a few drinks in hideaways ... to come onto the floor
late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear
deterrence,'' or to accept speaking fees, campaign contributions and
paid vacations ``from special interests who have a vested interest
in the legislative process.''

<TEXT>
   Officials of South Korea and North Korea
met at the border on Thursday and resumed talks on a possible
meeting between their prime ministers.
   Delegates from the two sides exchanged greetings at the Panmunjom
truce site and chatted for about 10 minutes before beginning formal
deliberations.
   Last month's talks bogged down after North Korea demanded a halt
to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. The Pyongyang
government repeated that demand Wednesday.
   North Korea has said the talks cannot progress unless the ``Team
Spirit'' exercises, an annual event since 1976, are canceled.
   ``The South Koran authorities should, first of all, have a
corrrect fundamental stand and attitude toward the dialogue and take
a determined stand of discontinuing the `Team Spirit' joint military
exercises at once,'' North Korea's official Central News Agency said
in a report monitored in Tokyo.
   Another factor that may affect the dialogue would be Seoul's
blocking of dissidents from meeting with North Korean officials on
national unification Wednesday.
   South Korean dissidents, defying a government ban, scheduled the
meeting at the truce village of Panmunjom, but police overpowered
and arrested 28 dissidents heading to the site.
   Before the Feb. 8 meeting at the border village of Panmunjom,
hopes were high the countries would be able to agree on terms for
the prime ministers' meeting. It would be the highest-ranking
meeting ever between communist North Korea and capitalist South
Korea.
   Despite the North Korean demand, military officials of the United
States and South Korea have made it clear they will not halt this
year's exercises.
   Seoul observers believe the hardened North Korean stand also is
expected to affect a scheduled meeting March 9 between sports
officials of the two nations to form a single delegation to the 1990
Asian Games in Beijing.
   It's also believed North Korea may be displeased with President
Bush's recent visit to Seoul and last week's defection to Seoul of
two North Korean students.
   While in Seoul, Bush reaffirmed Washington's security commitment
to South Korea and said the United States would continue its
military presence. About 42,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South
Korea under a mutual defense treaty.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 16 grafs to UPDATE with details of Lorenzo's offer

   Eastern Airlines struggled Wednesday to avert a
weekend Machinists strike, offering pilots sweeter pay, job security
and other promises if they sign a new contract and defy a walkout by
fellow workers.
   ``If the pilots and other employees support the picket line and
don't show up for work, Eastern cannot survive,'' Frank Lorenzo,
chairman of Eastern's parent company Texas Air Corp., said in a
videotaped message sent to pilots of the unprofitable airline.
   The pilots' participation is considered pivotal to the success of
the Machinists' strike, which is to begin at 12:01 a.m. Saturday
unless there is a breakthrough in the union's 17-month-old contract
negotiations.
   Leaders of the pilots' union have urged their 3,500 members to
honor Machinists picket lines but indicated last week they would
reconsider if management made contract concessions to them.
   Lorenzo's message marked the most dramatic appeal yet by
management to quell the latest in a series of labor crises that have
afflicted Eastern for years and have have helped bring it close to
bankruptcy.
   He promised a five-year pilots pact with pledges of no furloughs
and offered other protections in the event Eastern sought bankruptcy
court protection or was merged into sister Texas Air carrier
Continental Airlines. The pact also offers 3 percent pay increases
for 1992 and 1993.
   The pilots union reacted skeptically and said close inspection
showed little substance to Lorenzo's words.
   ``In his videotape, Lorenzo made a fine theatrical performance,''
the pilots executive council said in a statement to members. ``Don't
be misled. Much work still needs to be done.''
   The council said the offer doesn't pledge job security and
actually contains $64 million in concessions, plus a demand that
pilots drop longstanding grievances it said were worth an additional
$250 million.
   ``The company has gone outside the normal bargaining process and
directly to the pilots,'' said Ron Cole, spokesman for the Eastern
local of the pilots' union. ``We think this is just part of a
continuing disinformation campaign designed to divide the pilots'
group.''
   The pilots' master executive council went into special session
Wednesday afternoon in Washington, Cole said.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   _ A federal judge took under consideration Eastern's request to
hire outside contractors to service 26 aircraft on the ground but
did not say whether he would rule before the strike deadline.
   _ Attorneys for the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers said they were seeking a federal court order
allowing Machinists to picket other airlines with which the
international union has contracts.
   _ Eastern employees reported receiving formal notification of
possible layoffs and plant closings, under the new federal 60-day
plant closing notification law.
   Eastern, which says it has lost more than $1 billion in the past
decade and is losing more than $1 million a day, wants $150 million
in wage concessions from the Machinists, who represent 8,500
mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground services workers.
   More talks were expected with the company on a contract
addressing pilots' demands for job security, a long-term financial
commitment to Eastern, and an agreement to keep Eastern routes from
being transferred to Continental, Texas Air's predominantly
non-union carrier.
   ``We would hope the pilots would remember that Lorenzo's made
agreements before and contracts mean nothing to him. He's not to be
trusted,'' said Frank Ortis, vice president of Machinists Local 702.
   Lorenzo earned a union-busting reputation when, faced with labor
strife at Continental in 1983, he filed for federal bankruptcy
reorganization and got Continental labor contracts abrogated.
   Eastern apparently would have to use management pilots and
possibly recently hired pilots to fly if the pilots' union honored
the machinists' picket lines. The flight attendants' union
leadership has urged its 5,900 Eastern members to honor Eastern
picket lines.
   In Wednesday's court hearing, U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins
took under consideration Eastern's request for permission to hire
outside contractors to service its aircraft.
   Eastern attorneys said 26 of its approximately 250 planes are on
the ground awaiting service because of a Machinists slowdown. The
company also reported incidents of vandalism.
   Los Angeles television station KTTV reported that Eastern has
contracted with outside companies, including concerns based in Hong
Kong, Costa Rica and Europe, to service its planes during a strike.
Elsinore Aerospace Companies of Downey, Calif., is among companies
hired, the station said.
   Eastern spokesman Matell said the company wouldn't discuss strike
contingency plans.
   In Washington, attorney Joseph Guerrieri Jr. said the machinists
were seeking an emergency declaration with the federal court to
allow the union's members to picket other airlines that have
contracts with the union.
   They are Northwest Airlines, USAir, Trans World Airlines, United
Airlines and Piedmont Airlines. A favorable court ruling could
result in Machinists honoring picket lines at those carriers, he
said.
   AFL-CIO officials have said they want their 14 million members to
boycott Eastern and Continental and help the Machinists in a strike.
The Machinists said they will picket other airlines, ships and other
transportation services.

<DATELINE>KIRYAT MALACHI, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's army chief of staff on
Wednesday defended the policy of beating Palestinian rioters but
acknowledged that in many cases the individual soldier decides how
much force to use.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron made the comments as he testified in the
trial of four soldiers charged with manslaughter in the beating
death of a 42-year-old Arab refugee last August.
   It was the army chief's most comprehensive explanation to date of
a policy that prompted harsh foreign criticism after pictures of
soldiers clubbing Palestinians were seen on worldwide television.
   He said beating as punishment was prohibited and force should not
be used once a riot is over. ``Deterrence is not the goal,
overcoming violence is,'' Shomron said, ``but when someone stops
resisting, that's a matter of opinion.''
   In another development Wednesday, soldiers arrested two
Palestinians who tried to stab and kidnap a Jewish settler in the
West Bank, the army reported.
   An army spokeswoman said a car ``approached in a suspicious
manner'' when a settler left his vehicle, then two men jumped out
and one tried to stab the settler while the other pushed him into
the car.
   The settler escaped and alerted soldiers, who closed the area and
erected roadblocks, the spokeswoman said. The Palestinians abandoned
their vehicle and fled on foot.
   Also Wednesday, anonymous telephone callers to a news agency and
to an Arab lawyer demanded the release of all Palestinian prisoners
held by Israel in exchange for the release of an Israeli paratrooper.
   Avi Sassportas, 21, has been missing since Feb. 16, when he
disappeared on his way home to Ashdod, south of Tel Aviv.
   Shomron, testifying before a three-judge military court, said
orders issued to commanders on Feb. 23, 1988 regarding beatings
outlined proper procedures.
   The army has contended that beatings are necessary to subdue
riots which have raged in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
since the Palestinian uprising broke out Dec. 8, 1987.
   ``Dispersing a violent demonstration must be done with force,''
Shomron said. ``Let us be clear these are not demonstrations over
food subsidies, but violent demonstrations that endanger the lives
of our soldiers.''
   ``You can beat someone to prevent an incident, disperse a violent
demonstration or to stop someone who is resisting an arrest,'' he
said.
   The three privates and a first sergeant are charged in the
beating death Aug. 22 of Hani Shami, 42, at the Jabaliya refugee
camp in the Gaza Strip. They face maximum prison terms of 20 years
if convicted.
   Earlier testimony said a stone-thrower the soldiers were pursuing
ran into Shami's house and, when Shami tried to keep them out, the
soldiers broke the door down, threw him to the ground, beat him with
a broom and kicked him.
   An autopsy determined he died of a punctured lung, and at least
12 of his ribs were broken.
   The courtroom's 50 seats were full Wednesday and relatives of the
defendants, who served in the elite Givati Brigade, were seated
behind them. Final statements in the case are expected next week.
   Defense lawyer Uziel Atzmon repeatedly asked Shomron precisely
when beatings were legal and when they were not.
   ``You are asking me about gray areas and asking for clear
answers,'' said Shomron, who spent 2{ hours on the stand. ``Soldiers
are told to use their own judgment _ how severe the situation is and
how much force is necessary.
   ``It is possible that these events will be seen as a deviation.
It shows how difficult the situation is.''
   ``I am responsible for the orders given but not for the actions
of every soldier,'' he testified. ``I expect the soldiers will
fulfill their legal orders.
   ``If officers give orders to troops that are not legal, it is no
doubt proper to investigate these orders.''
   At least 387 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising, most
shot to death in confrontations with soldiers, and 17 Israelis have
been killed. Thousands of Palestinians have been wounded or beaten.
   Six Palestinians were reported wounded by Israeli soldiers
Wednesday, three in the West Bank city of Nablus and three at the
Khan Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Those wounded at the camp
included an 8-year-old boy shot in the chest, Arab doctors said.

   Illegal immigrants are being housed in
tents after the dormitories at a southern Texas detention center
filled up with rejected applicants for political asylum, an
immigration official said Wednesday.
   Twenty-eight men slept in a tent Tuesday night, after the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ran out of bed space for male
detainees in buildings at the minimum-security center here, INS
spokeswoman Virginia Kice said.
   ``This is the first time the tents have been deployed,'' Ms. Kice
said. ``We've reached our capacity.''
   The INS, faced with a flood of Central Americans it maintains are
filing ``frivolous'' applications for political asylum after
illegally crossing the Rio Grande into southern Texas, has begun a
two-pronged get-tough effort.
   On Feb. 21, the agency began immediate arrest and detention of
asylum-seekers whose cases are denied. At the same time, it added
more than 100 new Border Patrol agents to police the border.
   Asylum applicants previously were allowed to travel to their U.S.
destinations after checking in with the INS in southern Texas. The
INS office in Miami reported this week that half of the applicants
fail to show up for interviews there.
   Of the first 352 applications for asylum in southern Texas under
the week-old procedure, the INS granted asylum in just 10 cases, all
Nicaraguans. It denied 319 and issued ``intents to deny'' for the
remaining 23. An intent-to-deny notice means applicants have 15 days
to present documentation to bolster borderline cases.
   Political asylum is granted to those fleeing persecution. The INS
contends that most of the Central Americans seeking asylum are here
for economic reasons and do not qualify for political refugee status.
   Although the number of applicants for asylum has dwindled under
the new policy, Central Americans are still trying to cross the Rio
Grande, authorities say.
   ``They're still coming across,'' Border Patrol intelligence agent
Fred Rangel said in a telephone interview from McAllen. ``We're
pretty well swamped. There's no doubt about it.''
   On Tuesday, Border Patrol agents apprehended 249 non-Mexican
undocumented aliens and encountered one man who fired several shots
into a Border Patrol vehicle. The man escaped by jumping back into
the Rio Grande, Rangel said.
   The INS says it could house as many as 5,000 adults in tents at
its Port Isabel Service Processing Center, the lockup near Bayview,
about 20 miles northeast of the border city of Brownsville. Seven
large, brightly colored, striped tents so far have been erected at
the detention center.
   And 27 more illegal immigrants were being taken to the detention
center Wednesday after being arrested on an airplane in Charlotte,
N.C. Officials there said the aliens, arrested aboard a Piedmont
Airlines flight from Phoenix, had been put on a bus to the
immigration center near Brownsville.
   The total number of detainees hat Bayview on Wednesday was 1,011,
697 men and 314 women, including the 28 men in the tents. Some space
remained available in the women's fixed dormitory area, Ms. Kice
said.
   Family groups are sent to an American Red Cross shelter in
Brownsville, where 711 slept Tuesday night, double the number there
a month ago. The shelter's capacity is 800.

   The wife of convicted spy Jonathan Pollard
should be denied her request for independent medical care, as well
as her wish to be transferred from the Federal Medical Center in
Rochester, a federal magistrate recommended Wednesday.
   Magistrate Janice Symchych also recommended denying Anne
Henderson-Pollard's motions for further hearings, medical furlough
and removal of 24-hour surveillance at the Federal Medical Center.
   Henderson-Pollard, 28, who has several medical problems, alleged
in a lawsuit against the Rochester facility that what she called
inadequate care had amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. She is
serving two concurrent five-year prison terms on charges related to
her husband's spy activities.
   ``The record here supports a clear finding of no deliberate
indifference to her serious medical needs,'' Symchych said in
rebuffing Henderson-Pollard's request for an independent medical
examination and treatment.
   Federal Medical Center warden Joseph Bogan, she said, should be
``commended for his efforts to sensitively balance the medical needs
of the petitioner with the security needs of an orderly penal
administration of the Bureau of Prisons.''
   The magistrate's recommendations will go to U.S. District Judge
Harry MacLaughlin, who will make a determination, Bogan said. The
parties have 10 days to file objections, he said.
   Henderson-Pollard's father, Bernard Henderson of Secaucus, N.J.,
said he was ``appalled'' by the magistrate's recommendations but the
family had not decided whether to appeal because they had not seen
the ruling.

   They oohed and aahed at Times Square and the
Statue of Liberty, then gasped when the tour bus squeezed within 2
inches of a truck as it maneuvered through Manhattan's clogged
streets on Wednesday.
   The folks from Bolan, Iowa, were clearly a long way from home.
   ``You'll never run into this traffic in Bolan,'' said Linda
Nydegger. ``I like to visit but I sure wouldn't want to live here.''
   ``We wave at everybody. They give each other the bird,'' said
Daryl McCready, comparing motorists in Bolan and Manhattan.
   The entire population of Bolan's metropolitan area _ six
Bolanites and 10 from the ``suburbs'' _ had taken David Letterman up
on his offer to visit the big city.
   Letterman, prompted by a staffer intrigued by Bolan, paid for the
Iowans to come to New York for three days and appear on his show,
``Late Night with David Letterman.''
   On the show, Letterman immediately tried to dig up the dirt on a
town where everybody knows everybody and then some. ``Do you have a
town slut?'' he asked Ruth Hansen, 73. ``If so, when she comes up,
point her out.''
   Mrs. Hansen, a 50-year resident, chuckled at that. She and
Bolan's oldest resident, Agnes DeMaris, 78, were interviewed during
Wednesday's taping of the show to air early Thursday. Then Letterman
brought the whole town onstage.
   Letterman also put on the spot Lori Nydegger, 23, a weekend
resident who helped organize a standstill parade _ it doesn't move
and spectators walk around it _ to celebrate the town's 100th
anniversary three years ago.
   ``So, you're just here for the free trip,'' Letterman said as she
blushed and shook her head. ``Let's string her up.''
   Mrs. DeMaris, who is confined to a wheelchair, said in an
interview afterwards that she didn't want to make the trip because
of her physical condition but the Letterman staff insisted on the
entire town's attendance.
   ``When they told me the rest of them couldn't go if I didn't, I
decided I wouldn't make them people stay home because of me,'' she
said. ``I'll be tired tomorrow. I'm going home on the morning flight
but it was well worth it.''
   After the show, the Bolan residents headed off for dinner at a
Beefsteak Charlie's restaurant in Manhattan, courtesy of Letterman.
   ``It's like a dream. You don't want it to stop,'' said Duane
Abrahams, who along with the others will each be paid $150 for
appearing on the show. ``We've had this red carpet treatment.
They've just rolled it out.''
   The visitors planned to watch the show during a party they were
planning for their hotel rooms at the Mayflower Hotel, where they
were staying.
   At home, friends were house-sitting all the houses in Bolan, and
the post-bowling crowd at JJ's Tavern in nearby Northwood was
expected to linger longer than usual to catch the Letterman show on
the TV above the bar.
   ``I don't think there's anybody in Worth County that won't be
watching it,'' said Diane VanHorn, a secretary in the county
sheriff's department.
   On the Manhattan tour, which included a ferry ride to the Statue
of Liberty, a bewildered Ms. Nydegger asked ``What's that?'' when a
car alarm went off for no apparent reason.
   A few minutes later, she heard a man cursing loudly, also for no
obvious reason, as he walked on the other side of the street.
   ``Oh my,'' she said. ``They get kind of mad, don't they?''
   Her brother, Loren, 17, said he was ``asked for money twice in
one block.''
   ``I'm glad I grew up where I did,'' he said.
   In Bolan, there is an antique shop, a Methodist church and the
Bolan Store Inc., which owns three-fourths of the town's property
and sells farm equipment and supplies. The store is for sale.
   Each week, about 30 people attend church services.
   ``Practically all the women are in the choir,'' Ms. Nydegger
said. ``They have to be or we wouldn't have one. My brother rings
the bell, lights the candles and brings up the offering.''
   The 103-year-old community at one time had as many as 75
residents as well as a blacksmith, a train depot, lumber yards and
stockyards, a blacksmith shop and a creamery.
   But the automobile changed everything and Bolan's population has
remained relatively stable _ and small _ the last 20 years.
   There were only five residents until Chuck Yanacheak moved into
the community last October.
   ``The other 10 of us are in the suburbs,'' McCready said, which
isn't more than a block away.
   The Iowans rarely see motorists as they drive five miles through
corn and soybean country to Grafton, which has a post office, and
Mason City, which is 22 miles away and has a McDonald's restaurant.
It's a two-hour drive to Minneapolis and 2{ hours to Des Moines.
   McCready said he and his neighbors are enjoying the trip even
though they know some people are poking fun at them.
   ``We have to laugh at ourselves too,'' he said. ``Main street is
720 feet long and it ends in a dead end in a corn field.''
   But he added, ``When we see the mess and utter confusion of New
York City, I wouldn't sell my 88 acres for 88 acres in Manhattan,
unless I could sell it and move back to peace and quiet.''

<TEXT>
   Richard M. Daley, fresh from his Democratic
primary triumph over Mayor Eugene Sawyer, rallied his forces
Wednesday for a three-way general election battle against a black
alderman and a Republican nominee still to be crowned.
   Daley, son of the late, six-term political boss, Mayor Richard J.
Daley, drew overwhelming white support Tuesday and benefited from
low voter turnout, especially among blacks, to oust Sawyer, a black
former alderman.
   The victory made Chicago first among the biggest U.S. cities to
have a black incumbent mayor defeated by a white in an election.
   Daley, a three-term Cook County state's attorney, now faces a
third-party challenge in the April 4 general election from Timothy
Evans, a popular black alderman who has the support of Jesse
Jackson, and who also hit the campaign trail Wednesday.
   The outcome of the Republican primary, normally barely noticed in
this heavily Democratic city, remained in doubt Wednesday. Edward
Vrdolyak, a white former Democratic alderman and Daley foe who
launched a write-in candidacy only a week ago, claimed a victory
that if upheld could cut into Daley's core constituency.
   With five weeks of campaigning ahead, Daley was up at dawn to
greet commuters and tape a television appearance.
   ``I think my father's looking down upon me, on a beautiful, warm
day in Chicago ... very proud of me, and most importantly, proud of
the type of campaign that I ran in the last three months _ reaching
out to every community,'' Daley said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   At a commuter rail station, Daley pledged to avoid racial
divisiveness in the campaign's next phase: ``I'm going to be vying
for votes of everybody throughout this city and this is a city made
up of the black community, the white commmunity, the Asian, the
Hispanic community.''
   He predicted ``a good clean election.''
   Sawyer said his political career wasn't over but suggested he
would not back Daley or Evans. ``My general sense is that I will not
endorse anyone,'' he said. ``I am thinking it through and I've got a
lot of people to talk to before I decide.''
   With 2,843 of 2,911 precincts, or 98 percent, reporting, Daley
had 481,370 votes, or 56 percent, to 367,919 votes, or 43 percent,
for Sawyer. Three other candidates shared the remaining Democratic
votes, while the GOP race between Vrdolyak and Dr. Herbert Sohn was
considered too close to call Wednesday.
   Evans, 45, previously Sawyer's chief black rival, maintained a
low profile during the primary campaign. But he began campaigning
Wednesday at 6:45 a.m., shaking hands with voters at an elevated
train station and promising to crush the ``Daley machine.''
   Vrdolyak, 51, had no formal appearances scheduled Wednesday.
   The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners said Thursday's
official canvass would determine the Republican outcome.
   With 96 percent of 2,911 percincts reporting, unofficial results
gave Vrdolyak 10,711 votes, or 45 percent, to 10,234 votes, or 43
percent for Sohn. Two other candidates each had 5 percent.
   The elections board estimated that 64.5 percent of the city's
nearly 1.55 million voters went to the polls Tuesday.
   Daley's primary triumph gave him an advantage in the general
election, a contest Democrats have won without fail since 1931.
   In Washington, Democratic Party Chairman Ronald H. Brown
congratulated Daley and offered his full support to the party
nominee. In doing so, the first black chairman of a national
political party broke with Jackson, whom he had served as convention
manager last summer.
   ``Tough contests and hard-fought politics are nothing new to
Democrats and certainly not to Democrats in Chicago,'' Brown said in
a statement. ``The emphasis for all Democrats now must be on unity
and conciliation.''
   Daley proved his effectiveness as a political organizer, winning
broad-based support among white ethnics and Hispanics in the
primary. But he must work to gain support in the black community,
analysts said.
   If Vrdolyak, a slick campaigner and nemesis of the late Mayor
Harold Washington, is declared the winner over Sohn, observers said
the white vote in the general election could be split between
Vrdolyak and Daley, giving Evans the edge.
   Washington became the city's first black mayor after winning the
1983 Democratic primary, in which the younger Daley and incumbent
Jane Byrne split the white vote.
   Washington gained support from liberal whites and Hispanics to
repeat in 1987, becoming the first mayor since the elder Daley to
win re-election. But he died in office without having annointed a
successor, touching off a war between Sawyer and Evans that caused a
deep rift in the black community.

<TEXT>
   Riots broke out Wednesday in the
western slums despite martial law, and a newspaper said more than
200 people were killed in the Caracas area alone in three days of
violence over price increases.
   At least nine people were reported killed on Wednesday.
   The newspaper El Nacional said in its early Thursday edition that
more than 1,000 people were injured and 2,000 were arrested in
Caracas since riots _ triggered by a wide-ranging government
austerity program _ began on Monday.
   The newspaper listed the names of 159 persons whose bodies were
in the Caracas morgue, which it said was ``congested with corpses.''
It said there was a ``high number of corpses in other Caracas
morgues.''
   The independent newspaper quoted unidentified police sources and
gave no details.
   Government ministers maintained that calm had been largely
restored to Venezuela, but they censored international TV broadcasts
from Caracas.
   The army began to airlift food from the interior of the country
to supply Caracas residents running low on supplies as a result of
rioting and looting.
   Sporadic gunfire could be heard just blocks from the Associated
Press office as a 6 p.m. curfew fell over the city.
   Nicole Mendoza, a Caracas resident, said soldiers were piling
people into jeeps and taking them away outside her building to
enforce the curfew, which was announced Tuesday night.
   Fighting continued in Petare, a shantytown east of the capital,
and local hospitals were full of injured, a parish priest said.
Officials refused comment on numbers of dead or injured.
   A witness reported that an army unit shot mobs sacking a food
store in Petare after loudspeaker appeals failed to stop the
looting, a doctor who lives in Palo Verde, near Petare, told The
Associated Press.
   The doctor said four people were shot to death. There was no
independent confirmation.
   The government called on workers to return to their workplaces on
Thursday, saying violence was ``practically controlled.''
   Most businesses were closed on Wednesday. Before the curfew,
Venezuelans jammed the few remaining open food stores, which were
guarded by soldiers.
   Police battled with snipers in Nueva Tacagua, a shantytown in the
hills west of Caracas, and broke up mobs of looters in Catia, also a
slum to the west of Caracas, according to Radio Rumbo, a local
station.
   An AP photographer said he saw at least four bodies of people who
had been shot Wednesday in Catia.
   In the Chapellin neighborhood of Caracas, an elderly woman died
in her apartment from a wild bullet fired during gunbattles between
army units and residents of a nearby slum, said eyewitnesses.
   Radio reporters said delinquents were trying to break into homes
in Guarenas, about 30 miles west of Caracas, while homeowners were
defending themselves with gunfire.
   Interior Minister Alejandro Izaguirre acknowledged there had been
fighting in the capital but said ``calm has been restored to the
rest of the country.''
   President Carlos Andres Perez declared martial law late Tuesday,
saying the ``incredible tragedy'' of the violence threatened
Venezuela's ``consolidation of democracy.
   ``I blame the authorities, because we warned them we would need
protection way in advance,'' said Spanish-born businessmen Manuel
Taboada, whose four shoe stores were sacked by the looters. He
estimated his losses and damages at $2.6 million.
   Bus fare increases of 30 percent to 50 percent, and price gouging
by drivers were the immediate cause of the riots, but oil accounts
for 90 percent of Venezuela's export income and the economy never
recovered from the plunge in world prices several years ago.
   Inflation is expected to reach 70 percent this year, double the
1988 level, and the foreign debt is $33 billion.
   Perez, in office only four weeks, announced a sweeping reform
package under pressure from international creditors. It includes
freeing interest rates, doubling gasoline prices and letting the
currency float, which means higher prices for imports.
   Correspondents from Spanish and West German television said
state-owned television and telephone companies refused to transmit
images of the violence overseas. A government spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said there had been restrictions imposed
because televised reports of the disturbances were ``too crude.''
   It was unclear whether the censorship was connected to the
imposition of martial law, which prohibits public gatherings,
suspends the right to privacy and freedom of the press and permits
detention without charge.
   Perez said industrialists and the Venezuelan Confederation of
Labor, the most powerful labor group, agreed to an across-the-board
raise of 2,000 bolivars a month, or about $52. That would mean a
raise of more than 50 percent for people on the minimum wage.

the changes which are occurring in several areas of significance to

   A high-level advisory group once seen as the
best hope for crafting a bipartisan solution to the nation's budget
problems ended up deadlocked, issuing a final report today that
splits essentially along party lines.
   The seven Republicans on the National Economic Commission and the
one Democrat appointed by President Bush endorsed the president's
pledge against raising taxes and praised his budget submission to
Congress, calling it a ``workable plan for eliminating the deficit''
by 1993.
   However, the six Democrats on the panel who were appointed by the
congressional leadership signed a minority report calling Bush's
budget ``neither theoretically sound nor politically realistic.''
   The administration's $1.16 trillion spending plan for 1990
``rules out any discussion of additional revenues and relies heavily
on harsh and disproportionate reductions in domestic spending,'' the
Democrats said.

   Premier was a cigarette designed for people who
hate cigarettes: a butt that didn't cause cancer, that didn't cloud
the air with smoke, that didn't even dribble ashes.
   It also didn't taste very good. And that apparently is what made
the planned billion dollar project go up in smoke.
   On Tuesday, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. announced that after five
months of test marketing in Missouri and Arizona, it had snuffed out
Premier because it ``has not achieved adequate consumer acceptance.''
   During its short life, Premier neither satisfied cigarette
smokers nor placated cigarette haters. Despite its label, it was not
exactly smokeless. It gave off a steamy vapor reminiscent of
cigarette smoke.

   With a powerful assist from their government,
U.S. tobacco companies have made major inroads in Asia lately but
some members of Congress are fuming about the use of taxpayers'
money for ``exporting death.''
   ``The message we are sending is that Asian lungs are more
expendable than American lungs,'' says Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.
   Says Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., ``If we are as sensitive as we
are about health of American consumers, this certainly looks like an
outrageous double standard.''
   Levine, Atkins and several allies plan to introduce legislation
on Thursday that, in effect, would forbid the U.S. government from

   Major airlines are agreeing to a plan that
would require $800 million in work on aging airliners, and
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says steps are being taken
to write the proposal into law.
   Officials of United, Delta and American airlines who worked on an
aging airliner task force joined Tuesday in endorsing the group's
far-reaching recommendations to increase the safety of older Boeing
airliners.
   The task force, which also included other U.S. and foreign
industry and government safety experts, called for $600,000 in
modifications and replacements on each of more than 1,300 older
Boeing 747s, 737s and 727s.
   Bob Doll, United Air Lines vice president for technical services,
said the proposals conform with steps the airline is already taking
to keep its older airliners in shape.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo signed a new agreement to
buy the $5.4 billion Shoreham nuclear plant for $1 and close it
permanently, but some opponents were skeptical, saying ``Shoreham
continues to rise from the dead.''
   Under the agreement, the Long Island Lighting Co. will sell the
debt-ridden, unused plant to the state, which will dismantle it. The
plant, which has been subject to repeated licensing battles since
its completion in 1985, had come close to bankrupting the utility.
   ``It is time to end this matter once and for all and turn our
energies to new, productive measures for Long Island and the
state,'' said Cuomo in announcing the agreement Tuesday.
   Unlike a similar agreement last year, which was killed by state
legislators, Cuomo predicted this deal would succeed because it
largely bypasses the Legislature.

   Trains loaded with snow have been rattling
into this usually frozen capital in a costly battle to create the
winter that wasn't and save an annual tradition.
   A record warm winter threatened to melt away the Holmenkollen Ski
Festival, which begins Thursday, so organizers hauled in 5,600 tons
of snow by rail at about 1.5 cents a pound to rescue the event.
   ``Snow costs about the same per pound as wholesale sugar,'' said
Knut Almquist, secretary general of the Association for Promotion of
Skiing, which has organized the annual festival since 1892.
   Last month was the mildest January ever recorded in Oslo and
southern Norway. State meteorologist Oernulf Fremming said January
was a balmy 28 degrees warmer than normal _ and February was just as
freakishly pleasant.

<HEAD>High Interest Rates Gain a Growing Fan Club</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warning: Many of your fellow citizens these days
are quietly rooting for interest rates to keep rising.
   Though they may not noise it around, they'd be happy to see the
Federal Reserve continue to tighten credit, even to the point of
slowing economic growth and restraining the number of new businesses
and jobs.
   Who are these anti-growth Scrooges? Well, chances are their
numbers include at least some of your affable, law-abiding and
patriotic neighbors _ and maybe even you.
   You would certainly qualify for inclusion in this group if, for
instance, you have a fixed-rate mortgage on your house, which would
be unaffected by any change in current interest rates, and a chunk
of your savings in a floating-rate investment such as a money market
mutual fund.
   A decade or two ago, it was generally agreed that only a banker
could love high interest rates. While the costs of borrowing went
up, savers got little benefit, since the government set limits on
rates paid to depositors (as in the fabled 5\ percent savings
account).
   But in the modern world of deregulated finance, all that has
changed. People who are fixed-rate borrowers and floating-rate
investors see their incomes rise as interest rates go up, with no
concomitant increase in their expenses.
   This viewpoint is by no means a unanimous one. Families with
floating-rate mortgages right now are bracing for a blow to their
checkbooks the next time their monthly payments are recalculated.
   The impact is even more immediate on borrowers who have flocked
to the popular home equity loans in the past few years.
   With much home-equity credit, the interest cost goes up in
lockstep with the prime lending rate, which jumped a full percentage
point in February alone.
   Also, owners of long-term interest-bearing investments such as
bond mutual funds have seen the value of their principal eroded as
higher rates have pushed bond prices lower.
   Holders of bank certificates of deposit, meanwhile, watch in
frustration as the rates available on new CDs climb well above what
they are getting on existing deposits that won't mature for another
six months, a year or more.
   Still, long-term rates have risen much less than short-term rates
in the past year or so.
   ``In periods such as 1988 when short-term interest rates rose
while long-term interest rates remained stable, the household sector
did very well,'' observed Richard Hoey, chief economist at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``This pattern has been modified but not eliminated by the rise
in floating rate debt instruments (such as mortgages and home equity
loans) in recent years.''
   As savers and investors get more and more experience with the
vagaries of interest-rate fluctuations, the people who create and
sell financial products keep devising new approaches to the
situation.
   The floating-rate CD, in various forms, is one prominent example
in the banking world.
   A case in point among mutual funds is the Pilgrim Prime Rate
Trust, an investment company sponsored by the Pilgrim Management
Corp. of Los Angeles.
   It is set up to seek a monthly yield that fluctuates pretty much
in line with the prime rate, by investing in pieces of floating-rate
bank loans known in the trade as ``loan participation interests.''
   A possible drawback of this fund: a 3 percent sales charge up
front and an early withdrawal penalty for the first year after
purchase make it more suitable for long-term investors than for
people who like to move their money around rapidly with changing
trends in interest rates.
   In any case, the creation of investments like these keeps the
high-interest-rate fan club growing all the time.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's always been frustrating for the nation's
governors, accustomed to being the bosses at home, to come to
Washington and wind up as high-profile lobbyists.
   That was so even before the federal money ran out.
   But they keep coming, conferring, and urging their collective
wisdom upon the White House and Congress, where it usually gains a
polite hearing and little more.
   The National Governors' Association gets VIP treatment, black tie
receptions, audiences with the right people. But the message from
those people has become a warning _ don't look to the federal
government for more aid to the states. Expect less because there's
no money available here.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, told the governors that they will have to find ways to
finance some of the programs that face federal budget cuts because
Washington is ``fresh out of cash.''
   Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner said state governments
should anticipate increasing costs for the repair of dilapidated
bridges, the reconstruction of highways and the like.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, politely chided
the governors for wanting it both ways.
   ``You've got a number of policy statements here ... that call for
increased federal spending ... and yet another one that calls for
meaningful deficit reduction,'' Mitchell said.
   Actually, the governors couldn't agree on a deficit reduction
statement at the conference that wound up Tuesday, so they put it
off until they meet next summer in Chicago.
   The association's task force on the federal budget was to have
adopted a policy statement seeking freezes on military spending and
on some domestic programs, but with full funding for welfare, child
nutrition, Medicaid and similar programs. Those are programs state
governments will have to finance if the flow of aid from Washington
is cut or curbed.
   That proposal foundered on a dispute that mirrors the budget
debate in Washington. Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, the
chairman, wanted to build in provision for a federal tax increase as
a last resort. Republican Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South
Carolina, the vice chairman, balked.
   So Cuomo stayed home and the governors dealt with less
contentious matters, worrying all the while that the budget crunch,
coupled with President Bush's promise against new taxes, will wind
up pushing costs and eventually tax increases upon state governments.
   They adjourned with no consensus on what to do about it. Gov.
Gerald L. Baliles of Virginia, the association chairman, said there
must be investments in education, highways and other basic needs.
``Invest now or pay later,'' he said, although he did not say who
should get the bills.
   The Virginia Democrat did say that if there are federal budget
freezes, the governors ``would ask Congress to protect the safety
nets'' under programs for Americans in need. Presumably, Congress
also would pay the costs.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, incoming head of the association, said
that with the federal budget in trouble, the states are going to
have to take the lead on many of the major problems facing the
country.
   ``During the 1980s, a large measure of the responsibility for
governing in this country has shifted from Washington down to the
states,'' said Baliles.
   President Reagan wanted it that way. Reagan, former governor of
California, came to the White House in 1981 calling for a ``new
federalism'' that would make the states responsible for what had
been federal programs. The Reagan plan also was to return to states
the revenue sources with which to pay for those programs.
   They got the first half.
   During the era of Reagan budget cuts, the governors adopted a
resolution saying they could accept the reductions _ but also that
they would vigorously oppose any attempt to shift the cost of the
programs involved to state taxpayers.
   New administration, old debate.
   So, too, with the frustration level. When Lamar Alexander was
governor of Tennessee and chairman of the association, he said the
governors should change their ways and operate as chief executives
rather than trying to act like senators.
   ``There's certainly a weariness on my part at coming to

   A building falls on magician David Copperfield
during his latest special, but who's worried?
   The building collapse is the highlight of ``The Magic of David
Copperfield XI: The Explosive Encounter,'' a special airing on CBS
Friday.
   Copperfield is handcuffed and sealed inside a safe on the fourth
floor of the White House Hotel in Charlotte, N.C. The 13-story
landmark, built in 1924, is to be demolished by means of
strategically placed explosives and wire cables that will cause it
to collapse inward.
   As a Mozart melody plays, the crew shuts Copperfield in the safe,
sets the explosive timer and runs out of the building. The building
collapses and moments later Copperfield appears from beneath a
blanket on a steel plate.
   Magic or camera trickery?
   Copperfield was asked about suggestions that his spectacular TV
feats, such as making the Statue of Liberty or a jet airplane
disappear, are not true illusions but use camera tricks.
   ``That's not true,'' said Copperfield as he watched a tape of the
building collapse on a monitor in an editing room. He had just
arrived a few minutes before from Nashville, where he had been
performing on stage.
   ``I think a lot of magicians are jealous. When I hear that, it's
a compliment. People ask me to, say, cure a headache. I say I'm only
an illusionist. I always work in front of an audience. There were
40,000 people watching when the building came down. It was all done
in one unedited camera shot.
   ``Besides, the network is very strict. They would never permit me
to take advantage of the audience. There are people who are funnier
than me, people who are better looking. If you could do it with a
camera, they could use anybody.''
   It is the 11th special Copperfield has done for CBS. It features
such new illusions as dancing ties and an origami box. His guest is
Emma Samms of ABC's ``Dynasty,'' who participates in a levitation
illusion.
   ``I combine magic with a story and romantic music,'' he said.
``We use a lot of contemporary rock 'n' roll, from the Pet Shop Boys
to Peter Gabriel to Sting. ...
   ``It's very important for me to keep my magic current. It's an
art form that keeps growing. If more of us were doing it you'd see
more transition in magic. Since I'm one of the few who gets exposure
I feel a responsibility to guide magic into new areas.''
   As he talked the monitor in the screening room showed his various
illusions.
   He borrowed a necktie from a man in the audience and made it
dance and drink milk through a straw while Harry Belafonte sang
``Angelina.''
   The illusion using origami, the Japanese art of folding paper
into figures, begins with a small box penetrated by three swords.
Copperfield pulls out the swords and unfolds the box until it
becomes a large box. A woman then steps into it. Copperfield folds
it until it is small again. He then re-inserts the swords. Finally,
he opens the box again, and when the woman emerges she is wearing
different clothing.
   ``Emma Samms and anyone who appears on my show must sign a
secrecy agreement,'' Copperfield said. ``Even when I build the
equipment for my illusions, I give sections of it to different
builders. Members of my crew have different tasks. I do have
illusion designers, but I work out most of my own illusions. They
may suggest a different way to do it.''
   Copperfield said he also has a project in which magic is used as
therapy in hospitals around the world. ``We teach magic to patients
to help them regain dexterity,'' he said.
   ``For me for a long time magic was just a job. I was in China for
the illusion of walking through the Great Wall. Someone said, `Look,
you're doing what you want to do and here you are in China.' I
slapped myself on the face and I've been enjoying magic ever since.''

<HEAD>Really Easy Credit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An amazing turnabout in American attitudes toward
consumer credit is presenting Alan Greenspan with a monetary
challenge that most of his predecessors did not face.
   Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has been tightening
the money supply for nearly a year now, but consumers continue to
buy up a storm, all but ignoring his efforts.
   At least part of the explanation lies in the fact that as
Greenspan seeks to restrain the use of credit, the private sector is
going all out to make it available.
   So comfortable are Americans with easy consumer credit these
days, that a comparison with attitudes in the 1960s seems to span a
century rather than just two decades.
   Back then, a personal loan at a commercial bank might have
involved a long application form, an interview with a stone-faced
loan officer and a wait of weeks while the bank's loan committee
considered your credit-worthiness.
   Generally, the specific reason for seeking the money had to be
stated. And if the reason given was ``bill consolidation'' some
banks would insist on using the funds to make the payment themselves
rather than trusting the applicant.
   Today, you need not ask for money. It is offered to you via
credit cards by banks whose existence you had not known before and
who obtaned your name from a purchased mailing list. ``You deserve a
line of credit,'' they state.
   Should you accept the offer and maintain a record of on-time
repayments you might hear from the bank again. ``We enjoy doing
business with people like you who pay on time,'' they say. ``We are
raising your credit limit.''
   You needn't buy merchandise with your credit; you are free to ask
for cash, and then to use at least some of it for regular living
expenses. Money machines are placed so that your urge for credit can
be indulged anywhere, anytime.
   If you remain a reluctant spender you are enticed with
merchandise and prizes. Big banks today are in the retailing
business, offering cardholders insurance, television sets, travel
arrangements and more at a discount.
   The easy credit doesn't apply only to small items. In the 1960s,
the idea of offering discount credit to car buyers probably wasn't
even imagined. Today it is routine. Let Alan Greenspan do what he
wants with interest rates, the sellers of automobiles will give you
a rate considerably below that.
   In addition, they might offer you terms that really are easy.
Some of them are pulling back from those terms in recent months, but
there still are a lot of five-year car loans out there _ loans that
might even outlast the car.
   In most of these transactions there is no harsh grilling, as
there used to be. In fact, much of today's credit is offered,
accepted and used without there ever being a personal encounter.
It's all done by mail, and sometimes by phone.
   Even the house in which you live can be used as a line of credit,
thanks to the home equity loan. As long as you have sufficient
equity in your house, and the ability to repay, the money is
forthcoming almost automatically.
   Well, you say, you could borrow on a house in the 1960s and long
before that too. Of course, but back then it was done mainly out of
need. You might even have pitied the pour soul who had to take out a
second mortgage.
   Today, the use of the house as a bank is entrenched. It is
considered smart to use your equity rather than letting it sit there
idly. Your rich Uncle Sam makes sure you get the point by allowing
you to borrow on the house tax-free, up to a point.
   These are some of the things you might consider when you try to
understand how the American consumer continues to spend in spite of
rising interest rates.
   Alan Greenspan considers them, which isn't to say that he and his
colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board know how to deal with them.

<HEAD>Autistic Youth Seeks Life's Work Through Numbers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERN ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOUNTIFUL, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tell Eric Robinson the date you were born
and he'll immediately give you the day of the week you first drew
breath. Same with dates in the future. He's a human calendar.
   Yet it's only weeks since the 19-year-old autistic savant
mastered buttoning his own clothes, allowing him to trade
elastic-waisted trousers for his first button-up Levis.
   Eric will graduate June 2 from a special education program that
has taught him the joy of work in an alien world. By the time he
earns his diploma, Eric hopes to have found a life's work in numbers.
   A recent issue of the Viewmont High School newspaper dubbed Eric
the school's ``Rain Man.'' He shares many traits with the movie's
title character, but there are important differences.
   Eric's calendar calculations and aptitude for figures don't make
him a prodigious savant like Raymond Babbitt, played by Dustin
Hoffman. But unlike Babbitt, Eric's mania for numbers and improving
social skills let him hold down a job. They loved him in trials at a
video store and the school library.
   Tests show Eric to be mildly retarded as well as autistic and a
savant, a mix that puts his promising quest for work in a post
office or city library on a very uncrowded plane.
   ``They are usually so incapacitated in other ways that their
skill won't help them,'' said Dr. Edward R. Ritvo of the UCLA School
of Medicine, one of the country's leading authorities on autism.
   Indeed, those who knew Eric when he was younger are surprised at
his blossoming sociability. Greetings in the corridors are returned
with a not-so-nervous ``Hi,'' and he has somewhat relaxed the
obsessive routines and rituals that govern an autistic life.
   ``I was worried because I had heard that they got worse as they
got into adolescence and families had to decide what to do with
them. With Eric just the opposite happened. He just seemed to
improve,'' said Candace Robinson, his mother.
   ``He's just a huge success story for parents with autistic kids
who normally feel isolated, frustrated and believe ... it's a burden
that will never let up,'' said Cindy Anderson, Eric's special
education teacher.
   Years ago, Anderson's first autistic student spoke only in the
second-person and was prone to unpredictable rages that injured
herself and others. Eric, her third autistic pupil, is the first
savant and the only one to shine at the community vocational
opportunities Anderson arranges.
   ``I think he's trying to understand people's feelings,'' she
said. ``It's a very rote process, a very mechanical process.''
   Autism, absorption in self-centered, subjective mental activity,
is a severe disorder present in four of 10,000 births, an
overwhelming majority of them males. Its cause is unknown, but
evidence suggests chemical or structural abnormalities in the brain.
Among its characteristics is a profound disability in forming normal
human attachments, or in showing or receiving affection.
   Eric stiffens up when hugged, even by his parents, and won't let
on if he's sick or in pain.
   A study by Ritvo and others published in February's American
Journal of Psychiatry shows about two-thirds of those with autism
have some degree of mental retardation, scoring below 70 on
standardized IQ tests.
   Only about 10 percent of autistic people fall into the savant
category, and far fewer of those are mentally retarded, other
studies show.
   Mrs. Robinson believes her son, who hoards bus schedules and
loves to read the phone books he gets at Christmas, performs his
calendar gymnastics by visual rather than mathematical means.
   ``I used to wonder if he was calculating dates, but I really
believe it's a matter of having a photograph in his mind of our
100-year calendar. I asked him dates in the 1800s the other day and
he couldn't do it,'' she said.
   That's Eric's explanation, too, elicited in what is typically a
one-sided conversation with a stranger. He nervously checks his
watch every few seconds.
   How do you figure out what day somebody was born? ``I have a good
memory.''
   What do you want to do after graduation? ``Have a job.''
   Something with numbers? ``Yes.''
   He's a whiz at simple math and his memory for numbers is as
convenient as it is vast. ``He makes a great phone directory,'' says
brother Dan.
   ``I think about anything he sees he's likely to remember,'' said
Mrs. Robinson, who spent hours a few years ago making flash cards of
multiplication tables, only to have Eric render them useless by
memorizing the answers the first time through.
   Peggy Graham, manager of Video USA in this Salt Lake City suburb,
accepted Eric for an hour a day's training on a two-week trial
basis. He stayed for 1{ years, quickly memorizing the shelf code for
every videocassette in the store and eventually mastering the
computer to check in movies.
   ``He was amazing with numbers,'' Graham said. But it took him six
months to routinely talk to other employees and much longer to pass
time with customers. ``I used to stand by the door and say, `Eric,
you can't leave until you say goodbye to everybody.' He would
finally mumble goodbye.''
   ``The emotional connection is the last to be made by an autistic
child,'' Anderson said. ``It's so difficult to make people
understand the excitement you feel when they finally start making
that connection.''
   An earlier stint shelving books at the school library gave Eric
command of the Dewey Decimal System and friendship with the
once-skeptical librarian. He was far less avid about custodial and
landscaping jobs, and Anderson believes absence of social
interaction as much as numbers accounts for that today.
   ``He reaches out to people. His social habits are much more
appropriate,'' she said, citing Eric's response to the death of a
school administrator's wife. As expected, Eric affably recapitulated
for the bereaved husband the obituary information from the newspaper.
   But then he added, ``I'm so sorry about your wife.''

<TEXT>
   Six years after Ronald Reagan urged development
of space-based defenses that could make atomic weapons obsolete,
President Bush is seeking to put his own imprint on the U.S. nuclear
doctrine.
   The new president, who has given his National Security Council 90
days to come up with a plan, is expected to shift emphasis from Star
Wars to the deployment of a new generation of mobile missiles.
   That is more than a cosmetic change, returning U.S. doctrine to
deterrence instead of Reagan's radical vision of a world free of
nuclear weapons.
   Senior administration officials have said in interviews with The
Associated Press that Bush does not want to shift direction so
radically as to derail Strategic Arms Reductions Talks with the
Soviet Union.
   ``The talks are too far along for that,'' said one top official,
who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
   Caution, consistency and coherence are emerging as the credo of
the new administration, and the Bush's first defense budget will be
closely scrutinized to see how he translates rhetoric into reality.
   In a speech last month, Bush offered few details beyond asking
that defense spending be kept even with the inflation rate, a 2
percent cut from the request Reagan sent Capitol Hill in January.
   But more is involved than moving money from one program to
another to, in the president's words, ``insure that our capabilities
and resources meet our commitments and strategies.''
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, directing the nuclear
doctrine review, has described Reagan's nuclear policy as one of
``near total ... confusion.''
   Scowcroft signaled where he is headed in a report that he drafted
for the Center for Strategic and International Studies before he
joined the administration. The report suggested staggered
development of weapons started under Reagan, concentrating on the
single-warhead Midgetman mobile missile rather than the 10-warhead
MX or the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Bush postponed until April a choice between the MX and the
Midgetman, pending completion of the review. The chief of the
Strategic Air Command, Gen. John Chain Jr., opposed the Midgetman in
a Jan. 26 letter, saying, ``We can't afford it now.'' A
congressional estimate in 1988 put the cost of the Midgetman at
$13.8 billion, about three times the price of putting 50 MX missiles
on mobile rail cars.
   Continuing all the weapons started by Reagan would cost closer to
$400 billion a year than the $308.8 billion requested by Bush,
according to Congress.
   While Congress and the administration have dickered for a decade
on whether to deploy a mobile missile, the Soviets have fielded two,
the rail-mobile SS-24, with 10 warheads, and the road-mobile SS-25,
with one.
   Mobile missiles help stabilize the nuclear balance because an
enemy can never be certain where the missiles are, and they can be
moved many miles in the 20 or so minutes that it takes a warhead to
reach its target, according to Scowcroft and other strategic
thinkers.
   That means neither superpower can be guaranteed victory in a
surprise attack. Variations of that kind of deterrence have been at
the heart of U.S. nuclear doctrine, a concept summed up in the
acronym MAD _ the belief that a nuclear attack by either superpower
on the other would result in Mutual Assured Destruction.
   ``We have for 40 years relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to
keep the Soviet hordes at bay,'' Scowcroft wrote in a biting
critique of the bargaining positions that Reagan staked out at the
1986 summit in Reykjavik, Iceland.
   ``If we do have a strategic concept that brings order to all the
disparate actions and proposals of the administration, of which
Reykjavik is a prime example, it would be reassuring to know what it
is,'' Scowcroft wrote.
   In a 1983 speech, Reagan argued that technological advances made
it possible to defend against intercontinental ballistic missiles.
That might allow the superpowers to eliminate their atomic arsenals,
said Reagan, borrowing a line from the anti-nuclear movement.
   Reagan vigorously pursued his call for a space-based missile
defense and said a decision on deployment would come in the
mid-1990s.
   Bush stopped short of that commitment, and said last month that
he ``will vigorously pursue the Strategic Defense Initiative.''
   The Center for Strategic and International Studies report with
which Scowcroft was affiliated struck a similar note. ``Although
active strategic defense is a long way from negating deterrence
based upon mutual vulnerability, there is still an open question
about the long-term advantages of large-scale ballistic missile and
air defenses,'' it said. ``These systems might eventually be worth
the price of deployment beyond the year 2000.''
   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower has called Reagan's vision
of a anti-nuclear umbrella unrealistic. And for several years, the
scientists, engineers and military officers assigned to carry out
Reagan's research, in the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization,
have aimed for a system to enhance deterrence by making some U.S.
systems harder to destroy.
   Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, who retired as head of SDIO on Feb. 1,
argues that puts the United States on the same nuclear wavelength as
the Soviet Union, which he said never abandoned the doctrine of
strategic defense and maintains an Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
defense system around Moscow, as allowed under the 1972 ABM treaty.
The United States has no such system.
   The Soviets also maintain an extensive system of underground
bunkers which the Pentagon says are designed to protect the Kremlin
leadership in wartime, and has ``hardened'' numerous military and
industrial targets to help them survive a nuclear attack.
   ``The central political objective of U.S. nuclear policy is to
deter aggression against the United States and its primary allies'
interests,'' according to CSIS.
   By contrast, ``Soviet nuclear policy has as its primary objective
the deterrence of a U.S. first use (of nuclear weapons) during
crisis of war.'' ``Unlike the United States, Soviet writings and
statements made primarily by military professionals convey strong
preemptive overtones,'' the CSIS report said.
   Reagan's 1983 speech gave the Soviets the impression that the
United States was radically shifting its nuclear doctrine to a
strategy of preemptive attack. Such a doctrine, bolstered by the
technological superiority of the West, set off alarm bells in the
Kremlin.
   The Bush administration is sending signals that strategic
defenses may be in the nation's future, but that for the time being,
deterrence remains the bedrock of U.S. nuclear doctrine.

<HEAD>Soviets Review Nuclear Doctrine But Keep Bunkers to Protect Leaders</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-US Nuclear Doctrine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Buried deep beneath the village of Sharapova southeast of Moscow
are bunkers designed to allow Kremlin leaders to survive a nuclear
war.
   Contrast those shelters with statements by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev that a nuclear war cannot be won and should
never be fought and you face the imponderable dilemma of the nuclear
age:
   Why do the superpowers have atomic weapons and how will they use
them?
   In the Kremlin and at the White House, the superpowers are
reviewing their own nuclear doctrines. National security adviser
Brent Scowcroft is directing the U.S. effort, one that is expected
to change the defense budget, the shape of the U.S. nuclear arsenal
and American positions in arms control talks.
   U.S. and Soviet theories on the use of atomic weapons have
evolved over the decades, from the construction of the first bombs
in the 1940s until the widespread acceptance now that nuclear
weapons are too dangerous to use in war.
   ``We are profoundly devoted to the idea of a nuclear-free
world,'' Gorbachev wrote in ``Perestroika.''
   ``If the huge stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and other weapons
that have been accumulated are unleashed, nothI. Brezhnev
enunciated the ``Tula Doctrine,'' which states that a nuclear can
never be won and should never be fought. That doctrine has been
adopted by Gorbachev.
   But many Red Army officers, writing in theoretical journals and
training manuals, argued otherwise, leading many Western analysts to
conclude that Soviet war plans included a possible ``first strike''
against the United States.
   And many believed at the time that the Soviets might use tactical
nuclear weapons to try for an early victory during a war in Europe,
a view that was buttressed by the deployment of medium-range Soviet
SS-20s in Central Europe in the late 1970s. The SS-20s are being
destroyed under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force treaty, signed
by Gorbachev and President Reagan in December 1987.
   The SS-20 deployment, which was criticized by Soviet journalists
like Aleksandr Bovin and reformist scholars in civilian think-tanks,
was part of a massive military build-up under Brezhnev, giving the
Soviets parity with the United States in nuclear weapons, and near
parity or superiority in conventional and naval forces.
   The Soviets now say they have adopted the ``new thinking'' of
Gorbachev and want to eliminate nuclear weapons by the end of the
century.
   But U.S. officials say the Soviets have made no move to dismantle
their long-range nuclear forces or the bunkers where Kremlin leaders
could hide in the event of war.
   The Pentagon said in its annual report, ``The Soviet Threat,''
that the first bunkers were built 40 years ago, and that ``yet
another round of construction on these complexes began in the early
1980s, when Soviet leaders were publicly emphasizing that a nuclear
war would be so catastrophic that attempts to achieve victory or
even seriously limit damage in such a war no longer made sense.''
   ``The bunkers are a manifestation of the old thinking,'' said one
of the think-tank scholars who is backing Gorbachev's campaign to
trim the military. He asked that his name not be used because the
bunkers are considered a state-secret.
   Yet, many American critics of the Pentagon are persuaded that the
``new thinking'' has taken hold in Moscow.
   John Steinbrunner, director of foreign policy studies at the
liberal Brookings Institution in Washington, said the bunkers are
not evidence of a duplicitous Soviet nuclear doctrine. Rather, he
said, they are similar in concept to the airplanes that the United
States keeps at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, waiting to
whisk top leaders out of danger in the event of war.
   ``There are very good reasons to have those bunkers in order to
stabilize your command,'' said Steinbrunner. ``If your central
command can be eliminated by pre-emptive attack, you can be knocked
out.''
   Soviet leaders have claimed that they developed nuclear weapons
in response to such bombs in the U.S. arsenal. But the memoirs of
Soviet physicists, published in the 1980s, give evidence that the
Kremlin secretly sought to be the first to develop the bomb.
   Soviet work on the bomb began in the late 1930s. Through spies,
the Soviet leadership learned in 1943 of the U.S. Manhattan Project,
and ordered physicists to speed up their work.
   After the United States dropped an A-bomb on Hiroshima in 1945,
the Soviets redoubled their efforts.
   ``Provide us with nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time.
You know that Hiroshima has shaken the whole world. The balance has
been destroyed. Provide the bomb _ it will remove a great danger
from us,'' Stalin told the physicists.
   Four months later, the Soviets tested their first bomb, according
to David Holloway, a scholar at Stanford University and author of
the book ``The Soviet Union and the Arms Race.''
   The United States, nevertheless, retained a significant edge in
the number of weapons and means to deliver them. Unable to afford
the cost of maintaining a full land army in Europe, the United
States adopted the less expensive alternative of balancing Soviet
military might with nuclear weapons. That remains the fundamental
principle of U.S. nuclear doctrine in Europe.
   Although the Red army occupied most of Central Europe after the
defeat of Nazi Germany, the American A-Bomb denied them superiority
on the continent.
   During the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet politicians and physicists
engaged in a game of geo-political chess, maneuvering to place each
other's cities, military bases and allies at nuclear risk.
   Through the '50s and '60s, the Soviets struggled to keep pace
with the U.S. nuclear arsenal, but were hamered because unlike the
Americans, they did not have bases near their adversary on which to
base bombers and missiles.
   The launching of the first man-made satellite, the Soviet sputnik
in October 1957, signaled that the Russians had the means to build
intercontinental ballistic missiles, and helped prompt John F.
Kennedy to warn of a ``missile gap'' during his successful
presidential campaign in 1960.
   In 1962, Kremlin leader Nikita S. Khrushchev tried to put Soviet
missiles within striking distance of the United States by deploying
them in communist Cuba.
   The Soviet failure in the missile crisis spurred them to achieve
strategic parity with the United States.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Federal Farm Policy Needs Steady Hand at Wheel</HEAD>

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter makes it
plain that he intends running a tight ship through the stormy seas
where trade barriers, drought, poverty and foreclosure lurk as
monsters of the deep.
   But Yeutter also says he is not ready to keelhaul farmers and the
rest of rural America at the first sign of a budget knife. Some
things are done simply because it's right to do so, within limits.
   ``We still have to have compassion for folks who get into
economic difficulties in agriculture, often through no fault of
their own _ weather conditions, for example, like last year's
drought,'' he says. ``And we will probably want to continue special
privileges to help out young farmers so that they can gain entry in
this business.''
   Yeutter had been asked to respond Feb. 24 at his first news
conference at the Agriculture Department since joining President
Bush's Cabinet.
   The question was whether he agreed with a report by the National
Agricultural Finance Commission, which recommended, among other
things, that cuts be made in federal subsidies for agricultural
credit.
   Farming, the commission said, is a business and not a ``way of
life'' that should include government props for those who can't make
it on their own.
   ``I agree with the basic conclusion ... that farming is a
business that ought to be handled in a business-like way by
everyone, including the federal government, and that we ought not to
be running long-term welfare-like programs in agriculture,'' Yeutter
said.
   ``At the same time, however, we have to recognize that we can
achieve that laudable objective only in a gradual way,'' he added,
``and only through cooperation of our trading partners.''
   Thus, Yeutter shifted into the mode that he knows intimately
after 3{ years as President Reagan's trade representative. He led
the U.S. charge against foreign barriers to free trade and still is
a key player in the on-going Uruguay Round of negotiations under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   For many years, since a wheat-hungry Soviet Union blew the lid
off U.S. grain exports in the early 1970s, many economists,
commodity groups, farmers and politicians have held doggedly to the
idea that foreign markets offer the potential for prying American
agriculture out of its old ruts and dependence on federal programs.
   One of the reason for federal subsidies is ``because our farmers
and our marketers have to compete with subsidized products elsewhere
in the world,'' Yeutter said.
   If other countries agree to reduce their levels of subsidization,
the United States can do likewise and eventually ``trade distorting
subsidies'' can be eliminated.
   ``I put particular emphasis on the term `trade distorting'
because lots of people here and abroad have misquoted me as seeking
to eliminate all agricultural subsidies, and I never said that,''
Yeutter said.
   ``We can continue to provide income support to farmers as we deem
appropriate, and I suspect that we will be doing so for a long
period of time, simply because farming is a volatile business and it
is going to be very difficult to reach a utopian situation where no
assistance of any kind from the government level is required for
American agriculture,'' he said.
   After his confirmation hearing on Feb. 2, Yeutter provided the
Senate Agriculture Committee with 147 pages of answers to questions
that he and the panel didn't have time to cover during the formal
proceeding. Those will be hauled out regularly as debate unfolds in
Congress on various farm programs and proposed legislation.
   For example, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, asked Yeutter about the
future of agriculture and where full-time commercial family farms
are heading.
   Yeutter replied that ``the economic structure of agriculture is
likely to continue evolving much as it has in the past'' with fewer
and larger farm units. Harkin then asked about the federal role.
   ``Federal policies should provide assistance and support to the
farm sector in a structurally neutral manner,'' Yeutter said. ``In
other words, agricultural policies should be evaluated based upon
their benefits and costs to the nation, but their implementation
should not be slanted to favor one economic structure over another.''
   Yeutter added: ``Attempting to freeze a particular structure in
place would inevitably reduce the efficiency of the sector over
time. The European Economic Community experience in agriculture is a
classic example of this.''
   The indications now show that ``a family farm structure will
continue to dominate American agriculture, and I see no reason to
tilt farm policies away from that,'' he said.
   Harkin also asked about USDA policies to help young and beginning
farmers, and whether small and medium-sized farmers should be helped
to start and stay in business.
   Yeutter said policies ``should assure there are no artificial
barriers'' to prevent entry to farming but care should be observed.
   ``Helping these folks to start farming is one thing,'' Yeutter
said. ``Helping them to stay, no matter what kind of managers they
are, is another. The latter can be enormously costly to American
taxpayers. Successful farmers are not enthusiastic about paying more
taxes in order to assist unsuccessful farmers to hang on.''

   Lynn Whitfield's role as a successful doctor
helps create the positive black family image in ABC's ``HeartBeat,''
and yet she's eager to range from the mainstream to do controversial
material.
   She's one of the stars of the ABC miniseries ``The Women of
Brewster Place,'' the story of a group of poor black women, which
presents an unabashedly feminist view of the troubles they have with
the men in their lives.
   The four-hour miniseries, which airs Sunday and Monday, is based
on a novel by Gloria Naylor and also stars Oprah Winfrey, Olivia
Cole, Robin Givens, Jackee, Paula Kelly, Lonette McKee, Phyllis
Yvonne Stickney, Cicely Tyson, Mary Alice, Moses Gunn, Douglas
Turner Ward and Paul Winfield.
   Winfrey, as Mattie Michael, is the central character, but the
story of each woman is told. The film is interesting and well-made.
But it is anti-male, and black men in particular take their lumps.
With few exceptions, the men are ne'er-do-wells who shirk
responsibility and desert their women.
   Mattie is an unwed mother whose teen-age son betrays her and
causes her to lose her home. Ceil (Whitfield) is abandoned by her
husband after their child dies in an accident. Kelly and McKee play
lesbians, and when McKee's character is raped by a street punk she
takes out her rage on the nearest man, the kind-hearted building
superintendent who befriended her.
   ``I'm an actress who occasionally does material written by
feminist black writers who give their impressions of black men,''
Whitfield. ``When I did `for colored girls who have considered
suicide@when the rainbow is enuf,' I was attacked outside the
theater. ...
   ``It's a writer's prerogative to write it as she sees it. But I
know for myself, I'm ready to reinforce other ideas about the
family. I think it's a tragic flaw in black literature and drama
that so much responsibility is put upon the artist to present images
that are positive. It's unfair to dump all the responsibility onto
the artist.
   ``On the other hand,'' she said. ``It's not fair that there
aren't enough projects being done that cover a wide span of black
life. So any one project done takes on so much responsibility to
present good images of our race.''
   She said now that she has begun writing she ``can assume
responsibility for what I present.''
   She has written a treatment for a romantic mystery movie, called
``Passant Blanc,'' set in New Orleans in 1929, and a presentation
for a situation comedy.
   Whitfield's role on ``HeartBeat'' as Dr. Cory Banks would seem to
come naturally. She is the granddaughter of a doctor and the
daughter of a dentist. She grew up in Baton Rouge, La., where the
Leo S. Butler Community Center is named after her grandfather.
   ``I feel so good when I play this doctor representing my family
profession,'' she said.
   She recently helped select actor Robert Gossett, a cousin of
Louis Gossett Jr., to play her husband in the series.
   ``I'm very proud of what we're doing,'' she said. ``We're not
presenting a couple that is totally perfect. We deal with our
sexuality and our inner conflicts. We don't make comment about what
it's like to be black in America. I am a black person. Being there
is enough. I think we need to look forward and enforce the concept
that we are equal.
   ``America is a competitive society. You elbow your way through.
As a black artist I can't think of a better time to be around.''
   Ceil is not that different from Cory, Whitfield says, even though
the only obvious similarities between the two would seem to be that
each has a husband and child.
   ``Ceil is a woman who has the same desires (as Cory), but without
the education or the finances to manage it,'' Whitfield says. ``She
just wasn't programmed to move up in the system. Lucillia (Ceil)
Turner is a classic case of coming from a broken home. She was
raised by her grandmother.
   ``The most important thing for her was what she never had, the
solidity of a real home. She was married to a man who had no viable
trade or profession and wasn't equipped to make a good living. She
herself was not prepared to earn a living. It's a classic case of
our social-political system and how it works.''

   The government agency that safeguards bank
deposits is in the hotel and restaurant business. It's the phantom
landlord of several office towers, shopping centers, polo grounds, a
sewage plant and a 78-acre thoroughbred horse farm.
   What does the Federal Deposit Insurance Co. know about changing
bedsheets, flipping hotcakes, treating sludge or saddling horses?
Nothing.
   The FDIC inherited these properties after rescuing a spate of
insolvent banks over the years, and it's now auctioning them off en
masse to investors worldwide.
   Banking experts say the agency could be involved in many more of
these auctions in the not-so-distant future if President Bush's plan
for solving the nation's savings and loan crisis proceeds as planned.
   Bush proposes to restructure the thrift regulatory system by
giving the FDIC the added responsibility of insuring S&amp;Ls, currently
the job of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. The change
would pass on to the FDIC the authority of handling repossessed
thrift assets, including real estate.
   The Federal Asset Disposition Association, a subsidiary of FSLIC,
says it alone manages 2,400 FSLIC property assets in 33 states with
an appraised value of $3.8 billion _ most the result of bad loans
made by hundreds of failed thrifts over the years, half of which
were in the Southwest. Among the properties: a 497-acre safari park
in Branson, Mo.
   For now, though, the FDIC has its own white-elephant properties
to contend with.
   About $84 million worth, or 20 percent of the FDIC's current real
estate portfolio, will be sold this Thursday in a venture with the
auctioneer Christie's and the real estate firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield.
   The event marks the first large-scale real estate auction for the
FDIC and only the second real estate auction for Christie's, which
is better known for pitching multimillion dollar art collections and
rare jewels, not empty motels.
   Arthur F. Lorentzen Jr., assistant director of the FDIC's
Division of Liquidations, said the agency previously had disposed of
real estate holdings through smaller regional auctions or sealed
bids sales. He said the Christie's auction exposes the select
properties to a wider range of potential investors.
   On the block are 25 of the FDIC's largest properties, located in
Alaska, Florida, New Mexico, California, Tennessee and Texas, where
bank failures have been increasing.
   The auction targets range in value from a Houston apartment
complex worth around $650,000 to a 23-story office tower in
Knoxville, Tenn., worth around $24 million.
   A few had been owned directly by the problem banks while others
were turned over to them as a result of loan defaults, Lorentzen
said.
   When banks fail, the FDIC steps in to protect the deposits, then
tries to sell some or all of the assets to a healthy institution.
Sometimes it ends up with properties it doesn't want.
   A record 217 banks failed in 1988, up from 184 the previous year,
with many of them victims of depressed economies in the agricultural
and sunbelt regions. Some of the properties inherited by the FDIC
remain shut down, such as the 172-room Skyway Motel in St.
Petersburg, Fla., which the FDIC received after local Park Bank
failed on Feb. 14, 1986.
   Others remain open for business, like the 192-room Howard
Johnson's motel and restaurant in Knoxville, Tenn., once the
responsibility of City and County Bank, which failed May 27, 1983.
   
   ``We don't run them ourselves,'' Lorentzen said. ``We hire people
to do that.
   ``Anything we have it's our goal to put it back in the private
sector. Our main function is to insure deposits.''
   The upcoming auction list includes about a dozen land parcels,
three motels, two shopping centers, 10 apartment complexes and five
office buildings. Earl Reiss, executive vice president for Cushman
and Wakefield, said that domestic response has been good so far but
interest from foreign investors hasn't been as strong.
   Among the more unusual items:
   _T&amp;J Stables, based in Stevinson, Calif., a 78-acre thoroughbred
horse boarding, breeding and training facility. Horses not included.
Valued at between $575,000 and $775,000.
   _The Retama Polo Center and adjacent tract, located on 596 acres
in Selma, Texas. The parcel includes 16 polo fields, a 3,776-seat
grandstand, horse stables, a veterinarian's clinic and apartments.
Valued at between $7.5 million and $10.5 million.
   _The 23-story Riverview Tower, one of the biggest buildings in
Knoxville, Tenn. Valued at between $20 million and $24 million.
   _Sarasota International Trade Center, a water and waste-water
treatment plant in Sarasota, Fla., valued at between $900,000 and
$1.3 million.

   Barbara Blodgett was in a coma when she gave
birth to a healthy eight-pound son in December. Nancy Klein remains
in a coma after her husband won the right to abort her 18-week-old
fetus in February.
   The number of pregnant women who go into a coma each year is
small, doctors say, and many questions remain about how a pregnant
woman's coma affects the fetus and how a fetus affects the recovery
of its comatose mother.
   That's why Simon Alan Blodgett's birth was so unique _ and why
Martin Klein fought for an abortion, hoping to improve his wife's
chances of recovery.
   There are no accurate statistics, but three large U.S. trauma
centers report a total of about 20 cases of pregnant women in comas
over two years. Doctors at all three hospitals agreed that in most
cases the coma ends and the woman goes home and has a healthy baby.
With severe head injuries most fetuses abort naturally, are aborted
to help the mother, or die in childbirth.
   ``There is a very high incidence of spontaneous abortion that
occurs in these cases,'' said Dr. Robert White of Case Western
Reserve University, and director of neurosurgery at Metropolitan
General Hospital in Cleveland, one of the largest trauma centers.
``Out of this group they either spontaneously abort or after a few
weeks they go home to deliver.''
   In perhaps one comatose patient a year is a birth even attempted,
and White said he could not remember such a birth ever being
successful at the hospital. The mother often begins to ``unravel
medically,'' forcing doctors to try for a premature birth, he said.
``There is not a lot of research in this.''
   Doctors at University Hospital in Seattle said Simon Blodget's
birth was only the fourth successful delivery from a comatose mother
they could document in medical history.
   Dr. Madhura Patel of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who
specializes in treating head injuries to pregnant women, has seen
only seven such cases in two years. Several patients recovered with
fetuses intact but in one case of an unmarried teen-ager who was
five weeks pregnant, the girl's father ordered an abortion because
his daughter was unlikely ever to be able to care for an infant.
   ``The mother subsequently woke up from the coma but continues to
be impaired. She has no memory of the fact of ever being pregnant.''
   Mrs. Blodgett, 24, of Yakima, suffered brain stem injury in a
traffic accident June 30, when she was three months pregnant. After
initial reluctance, family members say, a Seattle hospital accepted
her. Doctors held out little hope of improvement, but shortly after
Simon's Dec. 9 birth, she began regaining consciousness and was well
enough to return home in mid-January.
   She has made steady progress and has limited use of one arm,
allowing her to cradle her newborn and point to letters to spell
words. Last week she began intensive rehabilitation at St.
Elizabeth's Medical Center in Yakima, and, in a unique challenge,
has vowed to walk and talk before her newborn.
   No one knows exactly why Blodgett came around after the birth,
although one doctor speculated that hormonal changes triggered a
return to consciousness.
   Family members feel she was conserving her energy for the fetus.
``After she had the baby, it was a signal for her to go,'' husband
David Blodgett Jr. said. ``After she had the baby she concentrated
more on herself.''
   The family ``never had a lot of hope from any doctor,'' Blodgett
said, but always had faith she would recover. ``We spent so much
time with her that you could see the small things she did.''
   Martin Klein had no such hopes. He successfully battled
anti-abortion activists to win a court order allowing the abortion,
which doctors said could aid his wife's recovery. Mrs. Klein, 32,
remains in a coma at North Shore University Hospital on New York's
Long Island.

<HEAD>Japan Threatens U.S. Lead In Markets, Merc Chief Says</HEAD>

   Japan threatens U.S. dominance in finance just
as it has in cars and computer chips, the president of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange says.
   The threat of competition from Japan was the driving force behind
the Merc's decision to institute 24-hour, worldwide electronic
trading through its Globex system, Merc President William Brodsky
said at a conference Tuesday.
   ``The Japanese are something that no one ignores in the world of
industry or finance,'' he said in an interview.
   The Japanese, who once scorned innovative U.S.-invented
securities products such as stock-index futures, have begun
electronic trading in Tokyo and Osaka of stock and yen bond futures
and soon will begin trading yen currency futures in competition with
Chicago.
   The desire to keep business executed through Chicago was behind
the Merc's development of Globex in conjunction with Reuters
Holdings PLC. The system, in which investments are traded on a
computer screen, is scheduled to begin in October.
   An Australian exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange,
which handles oil futures, have said they also will list contracts
on Globex.
   ``Innovation of this type is essential if the U.S. is to maintain
its leading competitive edge and remain a leading provider of
financial services to the world community,'' Wendy Gramm, chairwoman
of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said when the federal
agency approved Globex on Feb. 2.
   David Ruder, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, has called Globex ``the wave of the future.''
   The race to round-the-clock trading, faster computers and
instantaneous global communication poses a challenge to regulators
such as the CFTC as well as to an older generation of traders.
   One eventual victim of modernization could be the local traders
on the floor of the Chicago Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade,
some of whom are being investigated for allegedly cheating their
customers.
   Some outsiders have predicted that Globex will undermine the
Merc's chaotic but time-honored ``open outcry'' trading system.
   Brodsky denied that Tuesday, saying face-to-face trading in the
pits has advantages over faceless electronic trading, which will be
prohibited during the Merc's regular hours.
   ``Why are we here today in a room when we could all be on speaker
phones in our offices?'' he asked at the conference.
   Brodsky's comments came on the second and final day of a
conference on technology and the financial markets sponsored by the
Annenberg Washington Program and Northwestern University's Kellogg
Graduate School of Management.
   In another session, Harvard University economist Lawrence H.
Summers spelled out a proposal for a tax on stock trading to
discourage socially wasteful market speculation.
   A half-percent tax could raise $10 billion a year without doing
any damage to the stock market's basic functions, said Summers, who
was the chief economic adviser to Michael Dukakis, the losing
Democratic presidential candidate.
   Summers was disputed by Louis I. Margolis, a managing director of
Salomon Brothers Inc., and by Sanford Grossman, a Princeton
University economist.
   Grossman said it was unfair to single out the securities industry
for a tax.

<HEAD>Trump Shuttle Takeover Clouded By Eastern Labor Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire developer Donald Trump sums up his
philosophy as ``Never think of the negative. All obstacles can be
overcome.'' But there are some things that even the seemingly
invincible Trump, who plans to acquire Eastern Airlines' three-city
shuttle service, can't control.
   The bitter, escalating labor dispute at Eastern, as well as
pending litigation by Eastern unions against the shuttle sale, have
thrown a monkey wrench into Trump's planned debut in the airline
business.
   The 2-year rivalry between Eastern and Pan Am Corp. in the
lucrative Northeast shuttle business is expected to intensify when
the flamboyant Trump completes his $365 million purchase of the
Eastern shuttle.
   Despite the gathering storm clouds at Miami-based Eastern, Trump
and Eastern officials say they hope to close the deal sometime this
month. And the heads of both shuttles say they're gearing up for
fierce competition waged on the battleground of service.
   The two hourly shuttle services, used mainly by business
travelers, link New York with Boston and Washington. For both
Eastern and Pan Am, they are profitable units in an otherwise bleak
financial landscape.
   But Trump's takeover has been complicated by the strife at
Eastern.
   As a Friday strike deadline set by the airline's Machinists union
approaches, hope is fading for a last-minute settlement of the
16-month contract dispute. On Friday, the National Mediation Board
recommended that President Bush declare a presidential emergency _ a
move that would at least delay the walkout for 60 days.
   Observers speculate that if there is a strike, employees of the
Trump Shuttle _ all of whom are currently with Eastern _ could walk
out in sympathy with their former peers after the close of the
shuttle deal, planned for sometime in March.
   Bruce Nobles, the president of the Trump Shuttle, said his
company has recognized the Eastern unions as valid bargaining
representatives for Trump Shuttle employees. Trump's team plans to
negotiate separate agreements with those employees sometime before
or after the sale is completed, he said in an interview.
   If there is a strike against Eastern, ``We don't know what the
impact on us would be,'' said Nobles, the former president of Pan
Am's rival shuttle.
   The uncertainty created by Eastern's labor situation, along with
union litigation contesting the sale of the shuttle to Trump, could
even force Eastern to sell the service to the developer at a lower
price, one analyst suggests.
   ``Eastern is so hungry for cash,'' said Farrell Kupersmith, a
financial consultant to the Air Line Pilots Association who works
for Touche Ross &amp; Co. in Miami. He said that Frank Lorenzo, the
chairman of Eastern's parent company, Texas Air Corp., needs cash
``desperately'' and might knock $25 million to $50 million off last
October's agreed purchase price of $365 million.
   But Nobles and some analysts dismiss that idea as mere conjecture.
   Trump may bargain for labor peace by offering his shuttle
employees higher wages than what Lorenzo is willing to pay,
suggested Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   Murphy calls speculation, however, the notion that Trump is
``backing away'' from the shuttle acquisition.
   If and when Trump completes the deal, observers agree that the
shuttle showdown between the real estate tycoon and Pan Am will
hinge on service, not fares.
   ``It will be a highly competitive environment between the two
(shuttles),'' said Paul Karos, who follows the industry for First
Boston Corp. ``It's going to be a service battle.''
   Trump has said he plans to spend ``tremendous amounts of money''
to upgrade the Eastern shuttle, whose fleet of aging,
blue-and-silver Boeing 727s will be redecorated and emblazoned with
red, black and gold stripes as well as Trump's name on their tails.
   Harris Herman, chief operating officer of the Pan Am Shuttle,
said his team will continue to add services geared toward the
business traveler that he concedes could be matched by Trump. Pan Am
recently launched an advertising blitz calling its shuttle ``The
Corporate Jet'' and emphasizing services such as inflight telephones.
   The average shuttle passenger takes 10 round trips a year on the
service and earns $115,000 annually, according to Eastern. The
one-way weekday fare is $99.
   ``The (shuttle) market basically is pretty price-insensitive,''
Herman said.

<BYLINE>Smokeless Cigarette Flawed, But Won't End Innovations, Analysts
Say</BYLINE>

   Premier, RJR Nabicso Inc.'s ``smokeless''
cigarette, was dead on arrival because of its unpleasant taste,
industry analysts said. But they predicted the failure won't
forestall other cigarette innovations designed to counter complaints
about smoke.
   ``Everyone I know who tried it thought it was really horrible,''
said Pavlos M. Alexandrakis, who follows tobacco companies for Argus
Research Corp. in New York.
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., RJR Nabisco's cigarette subsidiary,
announced Tuesday that it was withdrawing Premier from the market
after five months of testing in two states.
   ``While smokers are very interested in the concept, the current
product has not achieved adequate consumer acceptance,'' the company
said in a statement from its Winston-Salem, N.C., headquarters.
   ``This is no surprise,'' said industry analyst Emanuel Goldman.
``It was brought out stillborn.''
   Goldman, who works for PaineWebber Inc., said Premier suffered
from two fatal problems: unacceptable taste and aroma.
   ``What the company was saying was consumers will get used to it,
they'll give it an extra try,'' he said. ``That's inconsistent with
the fact that we are a nation of channel-hoppers, and if you don't
like it the first time, you're not going to try it a second time.''
   Smokers also found Premier hard to keep lit, and weren't sure
what to do with the cigarettes when they were finished since
Premiers don't burn down like ordinary butts, said analyst Lawrence
Adelman of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``I thought the project initially was revolutionary in concept,''
he said. ``I think RJR Nabisco was very bold. But the technology
wasn't there yet to satisfy consumer requirements.''
   Premier differed from ordinary cigarettes in that it didn't
actually burn tobacco. Instead, smokers lit a carbon heat source at
the tip. During inhalation, hot air passed passed over an
aluminum-encased flavor capsule and dried tobacco.
   Despite its innovations, Premier didn't eliminate health
concerns. Several health organizations, including the American
Medical Association, last year asked the U.S. Food and Drug
Admininstration to ban sales of the cigarette.
   Several analysts speculated that the timing of Premier's demise
was due to the buyout of RJR Nabisco earlier in February by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. The New York investment firm needs to cut costs
at RJR to pay off the debt it took on in the record $24.53 billion
takeover.
   But others said Premier was doomed no matter what.
   ``I think the consumer reaction was so negative that it pretty
much was a foregone conclusion,'' Adelman said.
   KKR did not make the decision to drop Premier, said Betsy Annese,
an RJR Tobacco spokeswoman. It was a decision by the tobacco
company's management, she said, ``and they just agreed with us.''
   Adelman said RJR spent about $200 million developing Premier, and
an additional $125 million to launch the product in the test
markets. RJR had said it expected it would cost $1 billion to roll
out Premier nationwide.
   Reynolds said it had no plans to reintroduce Premier or a similar
product ``unless we have fully addressed the issues raised in the
test markets.''
   Ms. Annese said research on Premier led to much spinoff
technology, including some aspects of two brands recently put in
test markets, Vantage Excel and Chelsea.
   Vantage Excel has a new tobacco blend and special, high-porosity
paper that give off less lit-end smoke than ordinary cigarettes.
Chelsea has a distinctive aroma that is being marketed as being less
objectionable to non-smokers.
   ``We have learned an awful lot that will be helpful,'' Ms. Annese
said. ``We do not consider this to be a failure.''
   Analysts said RJR and other tobacco companies have other projects
in the works to reduce the smoke cigarettes emit _ the primary cause
of smoking restrictions and complaints from non-smokers.
   Adelman said some companies are looking at a change in the way
tobacco is packed into cigarette casings. Goldman said the biggest
innovation may come from biotechnology, which may provide new
strains of tobacco lacking many of its undesirable characteristics.
   ``The 1990s are likely to be a period of technological
breakthroughs (in cigarettes), providing you don't have an
advertising ban,'' Goldman said. He said a ban on cigarettes
advertising would prevent companies from successfully launching new
products.

<HEAD>Study Says Gay Men Are `Dream' Consumers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Madison Avenue ad agencies long have ignored
the gay community in their marketing plans, but a new nationwide
study portrays homosexuals as dream consumers.
   The report by Simmons Market Research Bureau of New York,
commissioned by a marketing firm that represents 125 gay
publications, found gay men in general have higher than average
incomes, higher education levels, fewer dependents and a large
amount of discretionary income that can be spent on luxury goods.
   ``The survey basically validates what we've known all along, and
puts quantitative figures on it,'' said Joseph Di Sabato, president
of New York-based Rivendell Marketing Co., which paid for the
survey. ``The gay market is economically a dream market.''
   The report questioned 4,000 readers, mostly male, of gay
newspapers in eight of the nation's top urban markets. It asked them
about their lifestyle and spending habits, including buying patterns
in travel, liquor, electronic equipment and apparel.
   Di Sabato, who says marketing companies have largely ignored the
possibility of targeting gay consumers, said Monday he plans to use
the survey's findings to urge national advertisers to place their
messages in more gay publications.
   The Simmons survey, completed in October and released this week
by Rivedell, found gay men had an average annual income of $36,800,
more than triple the national average of $12,287 as reported in
March 1988 Census figures.
   It also found the annual income of a gay household was $55,400,
compared with a national average of $36,500.
   Sixty percent of gay men are college graduates, compared with the
average of 18 percent for consumers in general. About 35 percent of
homosexuals also have some type of post-graduate education.
   Forty-nine percent of gay men hold ``professional or managerial''
posts, compared with about 16 percent of the population at large.
   While gay men are 50 percent less likely than the population at
large to own their primary residence, they are twice as likely to
own vacation homes.
   Gay men also are twice as likely to travel than those in the
general consumer market, and seven times more likely to go to Europe
than the rest of the U.S. population.
   Di Sabato said the buying habits of lesbians are not as easy to
calculate because of the relatively few major publications expressly
addressed to them.
   ``We have been selling the legend of (gay) high income, high
education, the low number of dependents, and the large amount of
discretionary and disposable income spent on high-ticket items _
like travel and imported alcohol,'' Di Sabato said. ``But other than
the legend, there was very little to back it up.''
   Di Sibato said the few national companies that have tried
targeting gay consumers have been rewarded.
   ``Remy Martin (cognac) has done ad campaigns (in the gay press)
six weeks prior to Christmas, and in June, prior to Gay Pride Week
(nationwide), and it has paid off for them,'' Di Sibato said.

<HEAD>Trade Journal Says Sprint To Buy Stake In Trans-Atlantic Cable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The US Sprint Communications Co. is
expected to sign an agreement to buy a major stake in a
trans-Atlantic cable that could boost its international
telecommunications business, a trade publication said this week.
   The trade journal, TelecommunicationsWeek, said an agreement
would be signed early this month under which US Sprint would acquire
Private Transatlantic Telecommunications System Inc. of McLean, Va.
   The trade journal did not disclose the financial terms of the
proposed acquisition.
   Private Transatlantic is installing a trans-Atlantic fiber optic
cable in a joint venture with Cable &amp; Wireless PLC of London, a
long-distance company. Each company owns half of the venture.
   Officials at US Sprint, based in Kansas City, declined to comment
on the report. US Sprint is the country's third-largest
long-distance telephone company.
   Paul Woodrow, a spokesman for Cable &amp; Wireless in London, said
his company had been talking with several big companies about
selling a stake. He declined to identify the companies.
   About half of US Sprint's overseas calls are transmitted on a
trans-Atlantic analog, or copper wire, cable. The rest are
transmitted by satellite.
   Fiber optic cables transmit calls digitally by using impulses of
light. Analog transmission, an older technology, is more subject to
distortion.
   Analysts said that in addition to using the new cable system for
its own calls, US Sprint could lease transmission services to other
long-distance companies.
   ``If the deal is completed as rumored, it would be a very
positive event for US Sprint,'' said Joel Gross, an analyst with the
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York.
   ``Not only would it make the company money, but it would give
them much better access within the European Community, which is
important, because international long-distance telephone service is
growing about 24 percent a year, more than double the domestic
rate,'' Gross said.

   A partnership between Zenith Electronics
Corp. and the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. could give the
United States an edge in the global race to dominate the
high-definition television market, Zenith's chairman says.
   Zenith and AT&amp;T announced Tuesday they were joining forces on a
$24 million effort to develop a processor-receiver and other
hardware needed to bring high-definition TV, which produces clearer,
brighter pictures, to the mass market.
   Separately, Zenith announced a $21.5 million program to develop
picture tubes for high-definition TV sets.
   Pearlman said the successful completion of the two projects would
yield ``real winning American technology ... that will allow the
U.S. to leapfrog the Japanese and Europeans'' in the mass-market
development of high-definition TV.
   Zenith, based in this Chicago suburb, and New York-based AT&amp;T
said they would spend $11 million and were seeking a $13 million
federal grant from the government to finance the
research-and-development project. They said it was the first time
two U.S. companies have combined on a major high-definition TV
research project.
   Last month, 16 U.S. electronics companies said they were
considering banding together to compete in the high-definition TV
market, but they have not yet announced such an agreement.
   The Pentagon has indicated it wants to help finance the
development of high-definition television because of its potential
military applications, and is seeking grant proposals.
   By combining AT&amp;T's integrated-circuit technology with Zenith's
television expertise, the companies hope to develop equipment for
evaluating and demonstrating Zenith's prototype high-definition TV
transmission system.
   The U.S. high-definition television transmission standard
prescribes 1,125 horizontal lines per screen, more than twice as
many as the 525 lines per screen on today's televisions, permitting
superior pictures.
   Zenith also announced a $21.5 million program to develop
large-screen versions of its ``flat tension mask'' high-resolution
picture tubes for military and consumer high-definition TV displays.
   Taylor said the company has used the tubes, which currently
measure 14 inches diagonally, in its computers for the last two
years.
   Zenith, the only major U.S.-owned producer of television sets and
picture tubes, said it was seeking $10 million from the government
to complement its $11.5 million commitment to the picture-tube
research program.
   Industry analyst James Magid of Needham &amp; Co. in New York, called
the Zenith-AT&amp;T partnership ``fantastic.''
   ``They should have a lot more partners than that,'' Magid said.
``This is a very big and important project.''
   Zenith spokesman John Taylor said the Zenith-AT&amp;T arrangement
``certainly wouldn't preclude us from teaming with others.''
   The market for high-definition television, including production
equipment and receivers, is expected to reach tens of billions of
dollars a year by the early years of the 21st century.

<HEAD>New Ad Study Puts Average Ad Production Cost at $145,600</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average original television commercial aired
in 1987 cost $145,600 to produce, according to a benchmark study by
an advertising agency group.
   The backers of the study say the methods developed for its report
will give the ad industry a recognized standard against which it can
measure from year to year what is driving commercial production
costs.
   In the past, advertiser, agency and media groups often have come
up with widely differing estimates of production costs.
   The American Association of Advertising Agencies said its latest
report was based on a computerized study of production costs for
2,042 commercials submitted by 22 ad agencies.
   The average production cost is 27.8 percent more than the
$113,940 average that the same group reported 1986, although people
involved with both surveys said no comparisons between the reports
should be drawn because of the changes in how the latest data were
compiled.
   They said the new report also should give advertisers more
comparative information than they have ever had on how their
commercial production costs compare with the average for companies
in the same business or doing the same types of ads.
   It found, for instance, that commercials for fast food, snacks,
beer and soft drinks were on average nearly twice as expensive to
make as ads for toys and recreation, $229,800 compared with $117,500.
   Commercials produced for national advertisers averaged $156,600
to produce, while those for regional advertisers averaged $102,000
and local ads cost an average of $56,900, the study said.
   The report said commercials that featured interviews or
testimonials were the cheapest to produce, at an average cost of
$76,300, while those using song and dance productions were the most
expensive, at $277,700.
   Commercials using special effects averged about $188,000, those
with animation cost $113,400 and those featuring a simple shot of a
product while an unseen narrator spoke cost $101,900.
   The average industrywide production company costs were $97,400
per commercial, accounting for the bulk of the total costs, the
survey said.
   The rest of the costs came from items such as performing talent,
editorial and post-production work, music and travel for the
admakers.
   ``The big news here is that we finally have a way from 1987 on to
use the same critieria in measuring commercial costs,'' said George
Bragg, the Lintas:New York ad agency executive who headed the study
team.
   Over the past few years, several trade groups, including the
Association of National Advertisers and the Television Bureau of
Advertising, have attempted to estimate average production costs,
but the results have varied widely.
   The advertiser group, for instance, estimated production costs
averaged $124,930 in 1985, but the television bureau said its survey
showed costs averaged less than 40 percent of that amount.
   Even the figures that the ad agency group came up with in recent
years are no longer comparable with the latest survey findings,
Bragg said.
   ``We are using an entirely different data base and different
criteria for gathering information,'' he said.
   He said the 1986 study included information from a number of
smaller agencies that were not included this year.
   But he said he expects to have figures for 1988 ads that are
comparable to the 1987 figures by mid-summer.

   The dollar rose against nearly all major currencies
in moderate European trading early today. Gold prices were slightly
lower.
   Dealers said market participants sold British pounds for dollars
in Asian markets before today's release of British trade figures for
January.
   The pound fell to a three-week low against the dollar on market
expectations that the British trade deficit will widen to $3.2
billion from $2.9 billion in December.
   The pound fell in London to $1.7350 from $1.7430 late Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.53 Japanese yen to a closing 127.68 yen. Later, in
London, it edged up further to 127.80 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8360 West German marks, up from 1.8230; 1.5685
Swiss francs, up from 1.5535; 6.2485 French francs, up from 6.1975;
2.0730 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0555; 1,351.95 Italian lire, up
from 1,341.50; 1.1975 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2005.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $386.50 a troy ounce,
down from $386.75 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $386.10.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $386.10, down from $387.15 bid
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 59 cents to close at a bid
$388.26.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid price of $5.84 a troy
ounce from $5.86 late Tuesday.

   The U.S. dollar today firmed against the Japanese
yen, while share prices declined for the third consecutive day.
   The dollar, following a 1.15-yen surge Tuesday, gained another
0.53 yen and closed at 127.68 yen. It opened at 126.97 yen, the
day's low, and rose to 127.81 yen at one point.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 300.17-point
loser Tuesday, shed another 21.30 points, or 0.067 percent, closing
at 31,964.30.
   The average has lost a total of 488.19 points, or 1.51 percent,
this week after closing at a record high for the second consecutive
day last Thursday. Friday was a public holiday for Emperor
Hirohito's funeral.
   Stock traders said buying incentives were strong at the start of
today's trading following Tuesday's plunge in Tokyo and an
8.03-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York.
   But investors began selling to take profits after prices rose
across the board in the morning session, and the Nikkei went back
down, they said.
   ``There was a widely shared feeling in the market that most
shares are overpriced and they had to fall sooner or later,'' said
one dealer at a major securities company. ``So investors are anxious
to take profits when share prices gain and sell when they decline.''
   Currency dealers said the dollar was strong because of increased
demand at the start of the new month.
   The manager of a commercial bank said the dollar was oversold in
New York overnight after the second revision of the U.S. fourth
quarter gross national product growth figures.
   ``The dollar was oversold, and people are buying it back,'' he
said.

<HEAD>FDIC Drafting Regulations On Brokered Deposits For Banks, S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is drafting
regulations that would require banks and savings and loan
associations to get its approval before seeking so-called brokered
deposits in their efforts to expand.
   Many experts have contended that the deposits put together by
brokers in $100,000 blocks _ the maximum insured by the government _
at above-market interest rates and then loaned out for high-risk
ventures such as shopping centers caused some S&amp;Ls to sink into
insolvency as the loans went bad.
   FDIC Chairman William Seidman told the Senate Banking Committee
on Tuesday that the regulations would be proposed ``very shortly.''
   Agency officials said the regulation initially would apply only
to the 8,000 banks that the agency supervises until Congress
completes legislation proposed by President Bush that would put S&amp;Ls
under FDIC jurisdiction.
   But Seidman said it would apply to S&amp;Ls then as well. And
officials said that they expect Congress to act on President Bush's
S&amp;L bailout package well before the FDIC can issue the new brokered
deposit regulations in their final form.
   Under the proposal, any bank or savings institution seeking to
increase its loan portfolio by more than 36 percent a year through
the use of brokered deposits or any other means would have to get
prior approval from the FDIC, officials said.
   For the past two years, the FDIC has been requiring banks to
submit quarterly reports on their brokered deposits. But regulators
said that is an after-the-fact reporting requirement only.
   The new regulation, they said, would give the agency pre-emptive
authority to stop a bank or S&amp;L from seeking such deposits if
officials believed they were going to be used to finance overly
risky ventures.
   ``They wouldn't be allowed to grow by using (high deposit) rates
like that unless they could show they had a good use for the
money,'' Seidman said after the committee hearing.
   In the three weeks since Bush announced his S&amp;L bailout plan and
the FDIC has taken supervision over 36 insolvent savings
institutions, the agency already has stopped one of them in Houston
from seeking more brokered deposits, an official said.
   After Congress deregulated S&amp;Ls in the early 1980s, many of them
_ particularly in Texas, California and Florida with their more
lenient banking laws _ grew several-fold in size through the use of
brokered deposits.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in testifying before the
Banking Committee last week, had defended the use of brokered
deposits, saying they provided many S&amp;Ls with liquidity that they
otherwise wouldn't have had.
   But Greenspan acknowledged that the high-interest deposits had
created a spiraling effect that contributed to the current S&amp;L
crisis, and he said he felt ``uncomfortable'' about them in some
instances.

   Many states are doing too little to tackle
major environmental issues including solid waste disposal, water
quality and protection of food supplies, according to an
environmental group that conducted a national survey.
   Renew America, a private environmental and conservation
organization, gave top ranking Tuesday to California and Oregon
among the 50 states, with Tennessee and Louisiana at the bottom of
the list.
   But the group, whose survey examined state efforts to deal with
five environmental problem areas, said that overall there still is
too little bele environmental problems on the state
level.
   Aggressive state initiatives to protect the environment remain
``the exception and not the rule,'' said Scott Ridley, who directed
the survey. In many cases, states are forced to make haing done to tackrd
budget
decisions with environmental protection losing out, added Tina
Hobson, the group's executive director.
   In other cases a state excelled in one area that was examined,
but fared poorly in others.
   For example, Maine was given the highest mark for dealing with
water quality issues but was ranked well below average in forest and
land management and average in protecting food quality.
   While Oregon was second only to California in the overall
ranking, in); drinking water
quality (Maine); food safety (Iowa); dealing with growth (Oregon).
   The survey ranked the states numerically, with 50 being the
highest possible when examining state actions undertaken to deal
with the five areas examined.
   In the overall ranking, which took into account state efforts in
all five areas, the top states were: California (42), Oregon (39),
Minnesota (38), Massachusetts (37), Wisconsin (37), Iowa (34), New
Jersey (34), Florida (32), Maryland (32), Connecticut (30), and
Washington (30).
   The states with the lowest ranking were: Louisiana (10),
Tennessee (11), Utah (12), South Dakota (13), Arkansas (13), Nevada
(14), Wyoming (15), West Virginia (15), Kentucky (15), and Indiana
(15).
   The report said the states with the best overall program aimed at
protecting drinking water were Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey,
California and North Carolina. The states with the worst record were
Arkansas, Nevada, Ohio, Tennessee and Louisiana.
   The study said there continue to be ``substantial gaps'' in the
monitoring of harmful chemicals in foods, although ``some states
have taken on a growing responsibility to protect food supplies,''
especially in monitoring for pesticide residues.
   It said the five states with the best programs for food safety
were Iowa, California, Minnesota, South Carolina and Wisconsin. The
states with the worst programs were Nevada, Indiana, West Virginia,
Utah, Louisiana and Wyoming.
   The report cited increasing concerns about the growing garbage
problem, but noted that only eight states so far have comprehensive
recycling programs and only 10 have laws requiring at least some
recycling of waste products.
   The states given the best marks for dealing with solid waste
disposal issues were Oregon, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Illinois,
Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and
Wisconsin. Those with the lowest marks were Mississippi, South
Carolina and Arizona.
   The study said Oregon, California, Wisconsin, Massachusetts,
Florida, New York, New Jersey and Minnesota had the best programs
for dealing with the impact of growth. States with the poorest
programs were Arkansas, Mississippi and West Virginia.
   The report said only seven states have enacted laws that attempt
to protect forests by balancing the needs of timber producers and
conservationists. It said the six states with the best forest
management programs were Washington, California, Idaho, Oregon,
Massachusetts and Minnesota.

   Here is a ranking of the 50 states on their
efforts to deal with five environmental concerns, according to a
report released Tuesday by Renew America, a private environmental
and conservation group.
   The ranking is based on a total numerical figure covering the
five categories, with 50 being the highest possible total. The first
figure after each state represents the state's overall score.
   The five figures in parenthesis reflect how the states scored in
each of the five categories examined with a top score of 10 possible
in each category)
   Those categories, in order, are forest management, solid waste
recycling, protection of drinking water, food safety, and control of
growth to protect the environment.

   Eastern Airlines' Machinists union says it will
disrupt air, sea and ground transportation nationwide if it goes on
strike against the airline Saturday, and AFL-CIO officials pledged
the support of their 14 million members.
   As part of a strike, Machinists union officials said they also
would picket outside Eastern's sister carrier, Continental Airlines,
plus other airlines, ships and transportation services covered by
the federal Railway Labor Act.
   ``We're talking about a total disruption of transportation in
this country,'' said Frank Ortis, Machinists Local 702 vice
president.
   Machinists leaders have been authorized by their 8,500 members to
call a strike after midnight Friday, which marks the end of a 30-day
cooling-off period set by federal mediators.
   Ortis and AFL-CIO strike organizer Gary Horton helped lead a
rally and news conference Tuesday in which dozens of local unions
were represented.
   ``We will urge our 14 million members not to cross any picket
lines,'' Horton said. ``It means that those members would probably
not fly on Eastern or Continental. Secondarily, they would be out to
rallies, they would be out to strike sites, they would be out to
financally support the Machinists.''
   Eastern officials have expressed doubt the Machinists can legally
or practically spur a nationwide action.
   Eastern, which says it is losing more than $1 million a day,
wants $150 million in wage concessions from the Machinists, who
represent mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground services
workers.
   The National Mediation Board, which entered the 17-month-old
contract dispute in January 1988, has asked President Bush to
appoint an emergency panel that could delay a strike 60 days.
Eastern says it can't afford the delay, but the AFL-CIO and
Machinists support the emergency panel.
   Separately, the Machinists filed court papers denying the
company's complaint to U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins that the
union was violating Atkins' injunction against a work slowdown.
Atkins scheduled a hearing for today.
   Meanwhile, the Eastern pilots union said Tuesday it was
continuing talks with management on a new contract covering job
security and other issues.
   Air Line Pilots Association leaders have urged their 3,500
Eastern members to honor Machinists picket lines. However, pilots
union members indicated last week they might cross picket lines if
Eastern granted contract concessions.
   Pilots generally are considered the most crucial and
hardest-to-replace airline employees in a strike.
   Eastern has declined to comment on negotiations this week.

<HEAD>British Trade Deficit Widens Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit widened to 2.09
billion pounds, or $3.63 billion, in January from a revised deficit
of 1.76 billion pounds in December, the government said Wednesday.
   January's trade gap compared with a deficit of 1.45 billion
pounds in January 1988, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   The financial markets had been expecting a deficit of about 1.85
million pounds and the Treasury moved quickly to say they
``shouldn't put too much emphasis'' on the figures.
   Monthly trade figures can be ``very erratic'' and ``among the
last indicators to respond to a tightening of monetary policy,''
said a Treasury spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with
British custom.
   The pound fell slightly on the news, from $1.7350 to $1.7300.
   Bryan Gould, trade spokesman for the opposition Labor Party, said
the figures show ``Britain is now an economy which cannot pay its
way and which is falling further and further behind in the
competitive race.''
   The figures showed exports totaled a record 7.37 billion pounds
in January, up from 6.9 billion pounds in December and up from 6.4
billion pounds in January 1988.
   Imports totalled a record 9.47 billion pounds in January, up from
8.66 billion pounds in December and up from 7.8 billion pounds in
January 1988.
   The December merchandise trade deficit was previously reported as
1.66 billion pounds. The government said the upward revision in the
December figures was due mainly to a revision in the seasonal
adjustments for 1988.
   With January's trade in invisible items, which covers services,
overseas investment earnings and official transfer payments,
estimated to be in surplus by 400 million pounds Britain's current
account showed a deficit of 1.69 billion pounds, compared with a
revised deficit of 1.36 billion pounds in December.

   Share prices were stronger around midday Wednesday,
as the market largely shrugged off government figures showing a
sharp widening in Britain's merchandise trade deficit.
   Share prices fell back momentarily after the release of the
January trade figures, but market makers notched prices higher amid
widespread relief that the figures would not lead to a further rise
in interest rates.
   The trade figures ``were dismal but hardly disasterous,'' one
dealer said.
   The trade deficit widened to 2.09 billion pounds, or $3.63
billion, from a revised deficit of 1.76 billion pounds in December,
the government said.
   By 12:30 p.m., the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was 24.4 points, or 1.2 percent, higher at 2,026.8 points, little
changed from 2,025.0 just before the trade figures were released.
   The market reached its intraday high of 2,027.4 around midmorning
and then fell to its low point of 2,014.3 minutes after the results
of the data were known.
   Share turnover reached a moderately healthy 341.6 million shares.

   A new plan to require $800 million in work on
aging airliners will provide an extra margin of safety, even though
the planes already are ``perfectly safe,'' an airline trade
association official said today.
   Officials of United, Delta and American airlines who worked on an
aging-aircraft task force joined Tuesday in endorsing the group's
far-reaching recommendations to increase the safety of older Boeing
airliners.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says steps are being
taken to write the proposal into law.
   ``Collectively we decided that it was far better to be
pre-emptive in our maintenance activity rather than to wait for
problems to develop,'' Clyde Kizer, vice president of the Air
Transport Association, an airline trade group, said today on ABC's
``Good Morning America.''
   The task force, which also included other U.S. and foreign
industry and government safety experts, called for $600,000 in
modifications and replacements on each of more than 1,300 older
Boeing 747s, 737s and 727s.
   ``The aircraft that are out there right now are perfectly safe
and the activities that the airlines are taking in regards to the
maintenance were satisfactory,'' Kizer said. ``This supplies an
extra protection margin.''
   Bob Doll, United Airlines vice president for technical services,
said the proposals conform with steps the airline is already taking
to keep its older airliners in shape.
   ``We don't anticipate anything over and above what we've already
planned to do,'' said Doll.
   Kizer said the proposals had nothing to do with damage to
United's oldest 747 on a flight from Honolulu to Auckland, New
Zealand, last Friday.
   Investigators into the incident in which nine passengers were
hurled to their deaths over the Pacific Ocean say they have found no
signs of metal fatigue or corrosion associated with aging. Instead,
they have focused on possible mechanical problems with the cargo
door that ripped off along with a portion of the airliner's skin.
   Julian May, Delta vice president, said none of his airline's
fleet of 130 model 727s would be affected by the proposals right
away.
   ``It will be several years before we are affected because of
fleet age,'' he said.
   Pan Am's top executive, Thomas G. Plaskett, also endorsed the
proposal, saying that unless older airliners are restored and kept
operating, there may not be enough planes to serve the growing
worldwide travel demand.
   No airliners would be scrapped under the proposal which asks the
Federal Aviation Administration to order the work that would include
replacement of parts subject to wear rather than repeated
inspections and repairs only when they wear out.
   An official of Boeing Commercial Aircraft Co., which manufactured
the affected airliners, said the older jetliners covered by the plan
are safe and should last indefinitely if the recommended work is
done.
   ``We believe that the aircraft out there flying are safe,'' said
Ben Cosgrove, Boeing engineering vice president who sits on the task
force. But he said the work was needed to reduce the number of
regular inspections needed for older aircraft.
   The recommendations are based on 150 service bulletins issued by
Boeing, which is now to write them into a single massive bulletin
for presentation to the FAA.
   Skinner praised the task force's work as the first product of a
cooperative international government and industry effort to deal
with the problem of the world's aging airliner fleet.
   The average age of the 8,800 airliners in use around the world is
just over 13 years, and aviation experts predict that will increase
each year for several years as new airliner construction is
backlogged and few old aircraft are junked.
   Skinner said the FAA has already begun ``the internal rule-making
procedures'' needed to make the recommended work mandatory for all
U.S. airlines.
   In all, more than 1,300 airliners worldwide would be affected by
the plan, about one-third of them operated by U.S. carriers. The
recommendations would also be given to foreign airlines and
regulatory bodies, some of whom participated on the task force.
   The proposed repairs and replacements would be tied to the number
of times an airliner had taken off and landed and its time in the
sky.
   Service records of older McDonnell Douglas DC-10s, DC-9s and
DC-8s and aircraft build overseas are also being studied by task
force committees. They are due to make recommendations later this
year.

<HEAD>Beer Flows Freely Again After 74 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ASGEIR SVERRISSON</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beer flowed freely in Iceland for the
first time in 74 years today as the last vestiges of prohibition
came to an end.
   Lines formed outside some of the nation's 17 state liquor stores.
Waiting patrons applauded when the Snorra Braut liquor store in
central Reykjavik opened for business at 9 a.m.
   Icelanders voted for prohibition in a 1908 referendum. The law
didn't take effect until 1915, when it was assumed the last
alcoholic beverage on the island had been drunk.
   The ban was repealed in 1933, but through a legal quirk beer with
alcoholic content above 2.25 percent remained under prohibition. A
powerful temperance lobby kept it that way until May when Parliament
voted 13-8 to lift the ban effective March 1.
   ``This is a truly historic moment in my life and the life of this
nation,'' said Pall Sverrisson, a cab driver. ``This is what we have
been fighting for, and this is what we have been dreaming of for so
long.''
   Many restaurants and bars reported their tables had been booked
weeks in advance by customers planning to celebrate.
   The luxury doesn't come cheap.
   With the government levying a hefty tax, liquor stores are
charging up to $57.60 for a 24-can case of imported beer. A glass of
beer in a bar costs $3.90 to $4.80.
   Education Minister Svavar Gestsson, who campaigned against
lifting the ban, accused the media of hyping the occasion and said
efforts to educate people on the dangers of drink ``have proved in
vain against this terrible flood.''
   Reykjavik Police Chief Boedvar Bragason said his force was on
heightened alert for drunken drivers.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. voluntarily agreed to
terminate Michael Milken and withhold his 1988 pay of more than $100
million, despite claims by the prominent bond trader that Drexel was
coerced into the provisions, the government said.
   In court papers filed Tuesday, federal prosecutors rejected a
motion by Milken to have Drexel's firm's landmark securities fraud
settlement with the Justice Department thrown out or modified
because it violates Milken's rights.
   The coercion issue is at the heart of the first legal challenge
to the settlement. Milken claims that Drexel was forced to resolve
the case or face racketeering charges that included freezing the
investment firm's multibillion-dollar assets.
   Milken alleged that the government forced Drexel to have him
dismissed and his 1988 compensation, most of it in a bonus that
would far surpass $100 million, withheld.
   Acting U.S. Attorney Benito Romano called the charge of coercion
``nothing short of absurd.''
   ``To argue that Drexel, a highly sophisticated investment banking
firm, represented by numerous highly qualified attorneys, was
incapable of making a voluntary choice in this matter strains
credulity,'' Romano wrote.
   In an accompanying affidavit, Drexel Chief Executive Officer
Frederick H. Joseph said the investment firm entered into the plea
agreement with the Justice Department ``voluntarily and without
coercion after consulting with counsel.''
   The statement _ while technically accurate since Drexel endorsed
the total pact _ appeared to be at odds with earlier statements by
the company that it disputed portions of the agreement and fought to
have provisions on Milken withdrawn.
   Joseph also was quoted in earlier court papers as saying the
Milken provisions were ``unfair'' and ``horrendous'' and were
inserted at the government's insistence.
   Drexel in December agreed to pay a record $650 million fine and
plead guilty to six felonies to settle criminal securities fraud
charges with the Justice Department.
   Milken and his brother, Lowell, a senior Drexel aide who also
would lose at least half of his 1988 pay, charged that Drexel was
coerced by the government into the requirements. Neither Milken has
been charged with any criminal wrongdoing.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood is to rule on the Milkens' motion.
   In his response, Romano also said the Milkens had failed to show
that their employment, pay and bonuses were constitutionally
protected or supported by a written contract. Joseph said neither of
the Milkens had a contract with Drexel.
   Milken, who still heads Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based
``junk,'' or high-yield, bond financing department, is one of the
biggest targets of a federal crackdown on securities law abuse. He
is expected to be indicted on fraud and racketeering charges in
connection with the government's lengthy investigation of Drexel.
   In a separate development, attorneys for Milken sought to have
proceedings halted while they ask the U.S. Supreme Court to
disqualify a judge presiding over Drexel's settlement of civil
charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The Milkens have asked that U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack,
who must approve the SEC pact, be disqualified because of an alleged
conflict of interest.
   The Milkens' attorneys on Monday asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals to issue a temporary injunction so Pollack does not make
any rulings on the SEC settlement until the Supreme Court decides
whether to consider the disqualification motion.
   The 12-member court last week refused a request to consider the
bid to have Pollack disqualified on grounds that his wife could
receive $30 million from a leveraged buyout Drexel recently helped
finance. A three-member court panel already had rejected the motion.
   If a stay were granted, it would hold up the SEC settlement,
which is in final negotiation stages. That in turn would delay
completion of the criminal plea agreement, which is contingent on
settlement of the civil charges.

   Alliance Semiconductor Corp. says it
plans to use a moth-balled American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. plant
near Kansas City, Mo., to manufacture computer memory chips and
other products.
   If successful, Alliance would be the first new U.S. company to

   The six-year lease calls for the eventual purchase of AT&amp;T's

   He said the Missouri site is worth between $250 million and $300

low-interest loan of $10 million from the state of Missouri and
several Kansas City companies.
   ``We're getting a $200 million to $300 million facility for
peanuts,'' said Reid. ``We're going to use the plant as the
foundation for manufacturing a number of memory products.''
   Alliance said it hopes to generate about $500 million in annual
sales within 5 years and employ more than 1,200 workers. Its current
work force is 12.

   The stock market staged a broad advance today
with some help from falling interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.97 to 2,270.36
iun the first half hour today.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 680 up, 271
down and 477 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.75 million shares as of 10

   Analysts noted that the market had shown signs since the start of
the week of recovering from the recent jolt it suffered from bad
news on inflation and a round of interest-rate increases.
   Rates declined modestly in the bond and short-term money markets
this morning.
   That apparently prompted money managers at investing institutions
to resume their buying of stocks in order to show competitive
performance results and a sizeable commitment to the market by the
time they make their first-quarter reports at the end of the month.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express gained \ to

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission today rejected a senator's request to delay a
controversial overhaul of AT&amp;T's rate structure despite widespread
congressional criticism of the proposed action.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick told Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., he will
press ahead at a March 16 commission meeting with the plan to change
the way American Telephone &amp; Telegraph charges customers. He said
the part of the proposal covering interstate service could go into
effect July 1.
   Exon asked Patrick at the hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science
and Transportation subcommittee on communications if he would
postpone consideration of the ``rate cap'' plan until two vacancies
on the five-member FCC are filled by the Bush administration.
   The commission has been two members short since the beginning of
last year and President Bush has yet to announce choices for the
open slots.
   ``It is extraordinarily important to restructure the incentives
that we give this industry,'' Patrick told Exon today. ``We have to
begin to send a message. The sooner we start on that, the better.''
   Patrick on Tuesday told the House telecommunications and finance
subcommittee the plan could save residential customers $700 million
in the next four years while giving AT&amp;T the incentive to streamline
and modernize.
   But subcommittee Chairman Ed Markey, D-Mass., asked Patrick ``why
all the people who are purported to benefit from this plan still
oppose it and why all those who are supposed to be regulated by it
are clamoring for its immediate implementation?''
   The FCC proposal would change the two decades-old ``rate of
return'' regulation that allows AT&amp;T certain specified profits
beyond its costs.
   The new plan _ what Patrick called ``incentive regulation'' _
would place a cap on what AT&amp;T could charge customers but would
allow the company to keep any funds after costs as profit.
   Congress let the plan die last year because of concerns that
windfall profits could result at the expense of consumers, but
Patrick is moving ahead with it after making changes he says meet
congressional concerns.
   ``We've made several changes to satisfy their concerns and we'll
continue to discuss them,'' said Patrick. ``But the commission will
consider the pricing matter on the 16th.''
   Patrick's July 1 target leaves congressional critics little time
to pass an alternative that precludes the FCC.
   ``At this point, we don't have a concensus,'' said Markey.
   Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said Congress has left a vacuum
that Patrick is filling with his action. He urged his colleagues to
``preserve our role in the regulatory process.''
   And Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., told reporters that Patrick should
postpone an FCC vote for a second time ``in new of the bipartisan
nature of the concerns expressed'' at Tuesday's hearing.
   Boucher was one of several lawmakers from rural areas who said
Patrick hasn't provided real safeguards to prevent AT&amp;T raising
rates unfairly for sparsely populated regions while giving discounts
to businesses and residents of cities.
   ``Talk may still be cheap in urban areas but it's about to get
very expensive in rural areas,'' an absent Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn.,
said in a statement read at the hearing.
   Boucher told reporters Patrick ``is making movement in the right
direction, but I think it's not enough.
   ``I'd say we would have price caps in due course,'' he said.
``But under this plan, AT&amp;T could be an enormous profit machine.''
   Patrick outlined provisions that would limit AT&amp;T's ability to
raise or lower rates for various customers and said he would look at
other safeguards to ensure price changes for less populated regions
``remain within the zone of reasonableness.''
   He said AT&amp;T would have to cut overall prices by 3 percent over
four years under the FCC plan.
   Patrick also sought to mollify Congress by proposing to divide
AT&amp;T's services into three ``baskets'' _ one group including
residential and small business customers, for example _ and allowing
only limited price increases or decreases for each service.

<HEAD>Xerox Introduces Three New Copiers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEBSTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. introduced three new copiers
today, including two low-volume models and a copier with a beveled
edge that can make copies from books without ruining bindings.
   The machines were displayed at a news conference at the company's
major manufacturing center in the Rochester suburb of Webster. Xerox
is based in Stamford, Conn.
   The low-volume copiers, the 5012 and the 5014, make 12 copies a
minute and come with Xerox's unique three-year warranty on parts and
labor and a copy cartridge guarantee.
   Xerox has always enjoyed a strong position in the mid- and
high-volume copier segments, but has not fared as well in the highly
competitive low-volume and personal copier markets.
   These new machines represent the company's attempt to increase
its presence in the low-volume market, which includes machines that
make up to 30 copies a minute, said Paul Cahn, vice president of
reprographics product support for Xerox's U.S. Marketing Group.
   ``We're aiming to set the industry benchmark for quality and
value in the low-volume range,'' Cahn said.
   The 5012 costs $2,325. The 5014, which has reduction and
enlargement capabilities, costs $2,850.
   The company's other new copier, the 5042, was designed for book
copying, mostly with the library industry in mind, Cahn said.
   It has a 35-degree slanted copying surface and a hinged cover
that will follow the shape of a book or other bound material instead
of squashing it down. It makes 35 copies a minute.
   Xerox officials said their studies found that in 1985 libraries
spent about $40 million to repair broken book bindings and they
believe the 5042 machine will help save bindings.
   The machine also features a versatile vending attachment that
will accept coins, bills and special vending cards.
   ``We have offered vending before, but it was just coins,'' said
Jim Miller, Xerox's manager of decentralized product marketing.
``And librarians told us they were tired of spending their whole day
making change for people.''
   The 5042 costs $9,470.
   All of the machines are available to buy or rent immediately.

<HEAD>Agrees to Sell Oklahoma City TV Station to Iowa Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palmer Communications Inc. of Des Moines,
Iowa, has agreed to purchase Oklahoma City television station KTVY
from Knight-Ridder Inc., which has put all eight of its network
affiliate TV stations up for sale.
   The agreement between the two companies was reached late Monday.
Terms of the sale were not revealed.
   The Miami-based Knight-Ridder, whose main business is newspaper
publishing, said last month it had reached agreements to sell five
stations and was negotiating on the sale of three others, including
KTVY in Oklahoma City.
   Its remaining two stations are WTEN-TV in Albany, N.Y., and
WJRT-TV in Flint, Mich.
   Knight-Ridder, which put all eight stations up for sale last
fall, said it expected to get a total of $400 million for them.
   William J. Ryan, president and chief executive officer of Palmer,
said the purchase is part of his company's overall growth strategy.
   Palmer owns two television stations in Iowa and five radio
stations in Iowa and Florida and has interests in cable television
and cellular telephones.
   The transaction must be reviewed by the Federal Communications
Commission.
   Knight-Ridder has owned KTVY since 1986 when FCC regulations
forced Gannett Co. to sell either KTVY or Oklahoma City television
station KOCO, which Gannett already owned when it purchased the
Evening News Association stations.
   The five stations that Knight-Ridder previously disclosed it had
agreed to sell are WPRI-TV in Providence, R.I.; WTKR-TV in Norfolk,
Va.; WKRN-TV in Nashville, Tenn.; WALA-TV in Mobile, Ala.; and
KOLD-TV in Tuscon, Ariz.

<HEAD>Spending By Consumers and Builders Weakens</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Grafs 1-6 new with Commerce Department reports today, picks
up 5th graf pvs, Consumer spending...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government issued two reports today suggesting economic
growth is weakening, contrary to a fourth-quarter 1988 assessment
issued Tuesday that signaled rising inflation and an unabated U.S.
appetite for foreign goods.
   The Commerce Department said Americans' personal income shot up
1.8 percent in January, the biggest increase in more than a year,
but that the pace of consumer spending was nearly unchanged after a
strong gain in December.
   A slowdown in consumer spending would be welcome news to some
because of worries that demand has been outstripping the production
capabilities of factories already coping with high operating rates
and tight labor markets.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said construction
spending rose 0.4 percent in January, the weakest performance since
October. Rising interest rates have dampened activity in most areas
of the construction business, with fixed-rate mortgages averaging
nearly 11 percent.
   The reports came a day after the department released figures on
fourth-quarter growth that worried economists because it suggested
pickup in inflation, partly because of the summer drought.
   While the overall growth figure of 2 percent was unchanged from
an initial report a month ago, the report also showed that the
country's trade imbalance worsened even more than previously
estimated. Imports grew at an annual rate of 13 percent, swamping a
7 percent gain in exports.
   Consumer spending rose at a robust 3.5 percent annual rate, too
fast given constraints on production resulting from tight labor
markets and high factory operating rates, economists said. The jump
in consumer spending, which went primarily to big-ticket items such
as cars, also showed Americans are still spending and borrowing to
buy foreign goods.
   In other economic news Tuesday, a real estate trade group
reported sales of existing homes fell 7.4 percent in January, the
biggest decline in two years. But housing industry experts said the
drop reflected a return to more normal buying patterns following a
December sales spurt.
   The National Association of Realtors said that existing
single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3.63 million units in January after 5.7 percent rise in December
to a rate of 3.92 million.
   None of the reports had much impact on the financial markets. On
Wall Street, stock prices rose slightly in what analysts called a
reflex response to its sharp declines of the previous week. Bond
prices, a sensitive barometer of the economy, fell sightly, and the
dollar finished mixed against foreign currencies.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Telemedia Inc., Canada's largest publisher of
consumer magazines, said Wednesday it has reached a tentative
agreement to buy New England Monthly, a 5-year-old regional magazine
that has been struggling toward profitability.
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed pending ratification of the
agreement by the magazine's 59 shareholders. Robert Nylen, the
publisher, said the legal papers will be completed this week and the
shareholders probably will vote before the end of March.
   Telemedia said both Nylen, 44, and the magazine's editor, Daniel
Okrent, 40, will continue in their jobs.
   Despite winning national awards for journalism and tripling its
circulation to more than 116,000, New England Monthly's costs
continue to exceed its revenues, Nylen said.
   ``We started in 1984 and we've made progress in each subsequent
year _ each year we've shaved our losses by several hundred thousand
dollars _ and now we're within striking distance of profitability,''
Nylen said.
   The magazine, based in Haydenville, Mass., has a staff of 40 and
annual revenues of more than $4 million. It won National Magazine
Awards for general excellence in 1985 and 1986.
   A literate, breezy, often irreverent publication, New England
Monthly frequently profiles small companies or craftsmen and devotes
one issue a year to ``local heroes.'' But it has been harshly
critical of some of New England's most powerful institutions and
individuals. Recent issues, for example, have cast Rhode Island's
leading families and Massachusetts' Lotus Development Corp. in an
unflattering light.
   Approximately $6 million has been invested in the magazine since
1984, and Nylen said Telemedia will inject ``a few million dollars''
more to keep it going.
   ``I expect that the magazine will operate much as it has. But it
is not immutable,'' Nylen said. ``What we really want is their
advice and counsel, and that may mean changes in marketing,
advertising or other areas.''
   Stephen J. Weir, Telemedia's vice president for finance, said
stockholders of the magazine will not receive any payment up front,
but will be paid over a period of years under a formula tied to New
England Monthly's future earnings. He declined to comment on the
potential size of the payments.
   The shareholders include private investors, venture capitalists
and two British merchant banks.
   Telemedia Inc.'s other holdings include Canadian television and
radio stations, the Canadian edition of TV Guide, and Harrowsmith
magazine.

<HEAD>London Shares Close Higher Despite Widening Trade Gap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock investors virtually overlooked news of a
wider-than-expected British trade deficit Wednesday and bid shares
higher on newly found hopes that the government might be able to
avoid raising interest rates.
   Equities were marked broadly lower immediately after the trade
figures were announced before midday, but there wasn't any selling
pressure to justify the markdown and prices soon recovered to their
best levels of the day.
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit widened sharply to 2.09
billion pounds, or $3.63 billion, in January from a revised deficit
of 1.76 billion pounds in December, the Department of Trade and
Industry said.
   ``There was relief that we didn't get a trade figure that implied
an immediate interest-rate rise,'' an analyst said. ``It is still
felt the authorities will avoid a rate rise if they can hope to do
so.''
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 18.9 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,021.3.
   Volume was moderate, with 535.4 million shares changing hands,
but most of this business came on a spurt of buying interest in the
morning, dealers said. On Tuesday, turnover was a meager 357.8
million shares.

   Sears' 824 stores across the nation began reopening today after a
42-hour facelift to complete price reductions on 1.5 billion pieces
of merchandise.
   ``People are backed up as far as we can see. It's wall-to-wall
people, said Bob Dumas, manager of the Sears, Roebuck and Co.
Northland Mall store in Columbus, Ohio.
   ``We have Christmas-quantity people, and we have better than
Christmas traffic,'' said Dumas, who estimated that more than 1,000
people waited outside for the doors to open.
   Workers changed prices Tuesday on everything _ including light
bulbs, toasters and polished door knobs _ as Sears, Roebuck and Co.
prepared for a new retailing strategy it hopes will win customers.
   Employees also had to change signs and displays, take inventory
and clean up before the openings, which occurred at noon local time.
   ``The worst was the screwdrivers,'' said Chris Skinner, a high
school freshman who spent much of the day at the Northland Mall
store in Columbus, Ohio, repricing baby booties and toddlers'
dresses. ``You had to take them all down, clean each one by hand,
then put them all back.''
   Sears intends to keep its prices low year-round, instead of
marking them up and down periodically for sales. This marks a major
change for the retailer, which helped to pioneer the concept of the
sale.
   Last year, Sears sold 55 percent of its goods at ``sale'' prices.
   The company said it still will run some sales, but for reasons
like simply clearing out lawn mowers in the fall. Otherwise, it will
use the strategy that retailers call ``everyday low pricing.''
   Sears, in adopting the strategy, joins a growing list, that
includes K mart Corp., Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target discount chain
and Montgomery Ward and Co.
   At the Columbus store, 700 workers scrambled to the tune of
``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' as they marked down items such as twin
canopy beds from $269.99 to $99.00, a Diehard automobile battery
from $72 to $64, and a Craftsman power drill from $59.99 to $32.62.
   Sears' new strategy meant reductions on 75 percent of its own
brands and the 1,000 other brand names it carries.
   ``I don't think they had any choice. They lost their customer
base,'' said Karen Sacks, an analyst with Standard and Poor's Corp.
in New York. ``I think Wednesday will be a madhouse at Sears. But
will they be able to re-educate their customers not to come in just
for a sale?''
   Monroe Greenstein, an analyst with the investment firm Bear
Stearns in New York, said the strategy paid off in Wichita, Kan.,
where sales rose 15 percent when Sears tested the idea last fall.
   ``And Sears will invest in an advertising campaign that, to not
hear about it, you would practically have to be comatose,''
Greenstein said.
   The cash register rings about 3,000 times a day in the
100,000-square-foot Columbus store, but the only sound in the last
couple of days was the clicking of pricing guns and muffled sounds
of store officials keeping in touch with walkie-talkies.
   About 100 high school students worked for $5 an hour to help
company officials in shirt-sleeves and scores of others with the
makeover.
   ``It's the most exciting thing I've ever been involved in in
Sears,'' said Bob Dumas, manager of the Northland Mall store and a
30-year Sears employee.
   ``It's no longer that old sea of yellow,'' he said, referring to
Sears' old yellow-with-black-lettering sale signs.
   The new signs, touting new, lower prices, are in vibrant red and
blue. In apparel, the signs are magenta and gray.
   ``They really needed to do something dramatic like that,'' Ms.
Sacks said. ``We'll just have to wait a year or two to see if it
works.''

buyers of 1989 Eighty-Eight Royale models, the company said
Wednesday.
   The free gasoline program gives Eighty-Eight Royale buyers Exxon,
Amoco or Chevron credit cards with a value of $648, the EPA's
estimated annual fuel cost for the cars.
   The other program involves cash incentives for buyers of several
models, including rebates of $1,500 for Toronado and Trofeo, $1,000
for Ninety-Eight Regency models and Touring Sedans, $500 for Cutlass
Supreme models and Cutlass Calais models without Quad 4 engines,
$400 for Eighty-Eight Royale models and $300 for Cutlass Calais
models without Quad 4 engines.
   The programs, both scheduled to expire Wednesday, were extended
indefinitely, the company said.

<BYLINE>Private Mausoleum Manufacturing a Growth Business</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLD SPRING, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   One man ordered a custom-built granite
mausoleum with two crypts included for the family's German shepherd
dogs.
   Another family asked for a specially designed walk-in
above-ground burial building with space for a son's favorite car.
   A third family had a mausoleum designed to include a favorite
chair from their sitting room for relatives to use when they come to
meditate the past.
   They're part of a growing market for preassembled or custom-built
solid mausoleums that inspired Cold Spring Granite Co., a leading
granite supplier with revenues of about $150 million in 1988, to
establish a Private Estates division to focus on what had been a
small part of company business.
   ``There's a trend of people wanting to be buried above ground and
it's increasing every year,'' said Wally Pattock, vice president of
memorialization. ``It's not something we developed, it's demand by
the people.''
   Of the approximately 2.3 million people who die in the United
States each year, nearly 10 percent have arranged for mausoleum
entombment, according to Cold Spring Granite, which has corporate
offices in St. Cloud, Minn. and two of its fabrication plants in the
nearby Cold Spring area.
   People have several reasons for choosing above-ground burial,
said Teresa R. Bohnen, whose title is market manager-memorialization
for Private Estates.
   ``The people most interested in private estates are those who
were nearly famous, who had major accomplishments but perhaps didn't
get the recognition they feel they should have,'' Bohnen said.
   The mausoleums ``are intended for the person who is looking for a
more exclusive form of immortality,'' said James Terhaar, general
manager of the Private Estates division.
   The growth of the private mausoleum industry, he said, is a
carryover from the increase in burials in large community mausoleums
around the country.
   Mausoleums have been popular in the southern United States, where
the water table or sandy soil makes in-ground burial impossible in
many areas, the company officials said.
   ``I always hear the words, `It's clean, it's dry above ground,'''
Terhaar said.
   Cold Spring Granite sold between 200 and 300 preassembled
mausoleum units in 1988. The units contain from two to six crypts
and range in estimated retail price from $12,000 to $40,000, Bohnen
said. There is no upper limit on the cost of custom units, which
have been sold for as much as $1.5 million.
   Except for highly specialized custom work, all sales of Private
Estates mausoleums are through cemeteries or monument retailers.
   The wealthy aren't the only ones to buy mausoleums. Middle aged
and elderly also are customers, Terhaar said.
   ``It really runs the gamut of society. In our (local) cemetery,
we have a guy who worked in the plant, crating products,'' he said.
``It goes all the way up. It's not so much the ability to pay, it's
more a desire for above-ground entombment.
   ``Certainly in number we sell more at the low end. That is within
the means of many, many more people,'' said Terhaar, who estimated
that the Private Estates division represents 2 percent to 3 percent
of Cold Spring Granite's total sales.
   ``We're trying to double that this year,'' he said.
   While there are several other companies in the country that make
mausoleums, Cold Spring Granite offers special service in helping
retailers sell the products and sending crews to cemeteries to erect
the buildings, said Terry Carlson, president of St. Charles Memorial
Works in St. Charles, Ill., a retail business that has bought
mausoleums from Cold Spring Granite.
   ``It's not a very common sale,'' said Carlson, who has sold nine
mausoleums ranging in price from $12,000 to $750,000 in 25 years of
business. ``I would say the largest percentage of monument shops,
like I am, never even sell one during their time in business.''
   Customers who buy the larger, walk-in mausoleums normally are
affluent families, he said in a telephone interview.
   ``It continues their lifestyle, their honored place in society,
in death as well as in life. I really feel it's a prestigious type
of purchase,'' said Carlson.
   But sometimes, he said, retailers have to let customers know the
mausoleums are an option.
   ``I think the dealer has to show the product. It's like buying
any other item. If you don't know about the Cadillac and they only
show you Fords, you're gonna buy a Ford,'' he said.

<HEAD>Contrary Views</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It can be refreshing and revealing, and even
educational, to take a contrary view of old and accepted ``truths,''
such as the notion that the customer is always right.
   Repeated again and again, some popular assumptions are accepted
without criticism, acted on without examination and repeated as the
gospel truth. Beware. In economics, old truths often are revealed as
old errors.
   There still exist, for example, many trusting purchasers who
believe the adage that the customer is always right. And there are
dutiful companies that faithfully adhere to that philosophy and even
advertise it.
   But that doesn't mean they really believe it.
   While not acknowledging it publicly, some producers of products
and services blame customers for not having the common sense to read
directions or the ability to follow the directions they have read.
   Research seems to document it. ``Two complaints out of three are
caused by problems for which the customer is at least partly to
blame,'' according to a research report in ``The Quality Review,'' a
professional journal.
   ``Instances in which customer incompetence has caused problems
span virtually every industry in every country,'' it states, the
moral being that perfect quality control at the factory cannot
satisfy imperfect customers.
   It cites the example of an unnamed manufacturer who became so fed
up with improper use of his product he ordered a sticker placed on
each item. It read: ``When all else fails, read the directions.''
   Another accepted ``truth'' is that the federal budget deficit is
the worst ever, that it is the cause of numerous other problems and
that there is no way to correct these problems without balancing the
budget.
   John Dessauer, an investment adviser who adorns his ``Journal of
Financial Markets'' with the slogan, ``authentic developments from
an untrodden point of view,'' feels we might be trodding over a clod
in the sod.
   Forgotten by all is the fact that a dollar in 1988 was worth only
48 cents compared with a dollar in 1976, he says. His point is this:
A 1988 federal deficit of $155.1 billion is the same as a deficit of
$74 billion in 1976.
   Since the actual deficit in 1976 was $73.7 billion, he says,
``the truth is that the federal deficit today is about the same as
it was when President Carter took office.''
   That's by one measurement. By another, he says, it might be even
less of a problem. In 1976, he points out, the federal deficit was
4.3 percent of gross national product. In 1988, it was 3.1 percent.
   Two other economic assumptions have gained tremendous
respectability of late, especially since they have been cited as
inflation signals by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board.
   With industrial capacity at close to 85 percent, and with the
jobless rate falling well below 5.5 percent, the assuumption is that
inflation is about to become red hot. Economists, often
argumentative, are almost unanimous about this.
   Edward Yardeni, economics director at Prudential-Bache Securities
INc., disagrees strongly. This is how he views the low jobless rate
and its potential consequences:
   ``We believe that the employers recognize that offering big wage
hikes will only drive up their labor costs rather than attract
workers that, demographically speaking, don't exist.''
   Instead, he contends, ``industries will opt to spend more on
labor-saving, productivity-enhancing capital to substitute for
scarce and expensive workers.''
   What about the capacity limitations of industry? ``We believe
that tight capacity stimulates capacity expansion rather than big
price increases,'' he says.
   He contends that the Federal Reserve's tough anti-inflation
policy is also anti-growth. And that, he argues, ``could dampen the
capacity expansion which is the best way of eliminating inflationary
bottlenecks.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Sink On Easing Supply Signals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for rain in
Argentina's soybean fields and signs that supplies may not be as
tight as previously feared.
   Wheat futures advanced modestly due to an increase in export
business while corn futures finished mixed.
   Soybean futures plunged in the session's final 10 minutes
following forecasts for rain in Argentina later today and over the
weekend.
   The selling also reflected an increase Wednesday in the number of
notices of intent to deliver soybeans against the March contract.
   A greater number of notices indicates a greater willingness among
commercial traders to sell physical soybeans, which suggests an
easing of supply fears.
   Soybean delivery notices posted Wednesday morning totaled 9.2
million bushels compared with 4.4 million bushels on Tuesday, the
first notice day for the March contract.
   Wheat gained strength from the Agriculture Department's decision
to target Iraq for sales of 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices, and from reports that the Soviet Union was
bidding for 500,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.39{ a bushel; corn was } cent
lower to } cent higher with March at $2.71} a bushel; oats were 1}

<HEAD>Sears Unveils New Prices, Ending Era of Big Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Shoppers swarmed to Sears, Roebuck and Co., which reopened its
824 stores Wednesday after cutting prices on 50,000 items to
introduce its new ``everyday low pricing'' policy and mark the end
of an era in retailing.
   The nation's biggest retailer switched to more name-brand
merchandise and discount prices in hopes of luring shoppers away
from cut-rate competitors like K mart and Wal-Mart, which have grown
rapidly at the expense of Sears and other old-line general retailers.
   ``I think it might cheapen them a little bit but they're a grade
higher than K mart,'' said Pam Cage, 31, one of about 3,000 shoppers
who crowded a Sears store at Miami's International Mall on Wednesday.
   The 103-year-old company added some suspense to the changeover by
closing all its stores for 42 hours, from 6 p.m. local time Monday
until noon Wednesday. Store managers and employees around the
country worked late into the night Tuesday, retagging an estimated
1.5 billion pieces of merchandise and erecting colorful signs
touting the new prices.
   In Atlanta, about 200 people gathered outside of Sears' Southlake
Mall store to get the first crack at the lower prices _ though not
all of them were convinced the change was for the better.
   ``My mother said if they cut all those prices it would be like K
mart. I say the day they do that is the day I stop buying here,''
said Marcy McCullough of McDonough, Ga.
   But in the past, she said, Sears has been ``charging too much for
stuff that's not really worth it.''
   Prices under the new policy may vary among the retailers' 24
regions, but Sears officials are convinced the strategy will win
approval.
   ``When customers come in and see we're not fooling around when we
say we're reducing prices, they'll be very impressed,'' predicted
Ken Smith, manager of a Sears store on Chicago's Northwest Side.
   Shoppers found markdowns Wednesday that approached 25 percent on
some items, including a house-brand Kenmore 18-cubic-foot
refrigerator slashed to $550 from $730 in Smith's store.
   He said the new price would be Sears' everyday price on the
refrigerator.
   Sears' switch to everyday low pricing, a strategy pioneered by
discount chains and adapted successfully last year by Chicago-based
Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., makes Sears comparable to the discounters in
price but not in looks.
   Although shoppers found some merchandise displayed in
warehouse-like stacks, most of the goods were shown in the more
decorative fashion familiar to Sears shoppers.
   The strategy marks a departure from the traditional retailing
technique, which Sears practically invented, of hyping goods through
periodic sales. Sears said it will continue to have sales, but they
will be fewer and thinner than in the past.
   Gilbert Wels, 44, of Sewaren, N.J., said he was worried that the
drop in prices could mean a decline in quality as well.
   ``I will still buy at Sears but I will check out the quality,''
he said.
   But not all customers were pleased.
   Lynn Carver of Barkhamsted, Conn., said she drove to a West
Hartford Sears store to exchange some bedsheets and found the price
was about 20 percent higher than the week before.
   Operating Manager Larry Glowa said the sheets had been on sale
last week and were not among the items reduced in price on Wednesday.
   The new policy is a major component of a restructuring plan that
also includes the proposed sale of the company's towering
headquarters building in Chicago and a realignment of Sears'
financial network _ Allstate insurance, Dean Witter Reynolds
brokerage services and Coldwell Banker real estate _ to focus on
consumer business.
   Sears stores will continue to change in coming months as more
name-brand goods are introduced. A major addition will be the
opening of Brand Central electronics superstores inside 400 Sears
outlets.

<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. hopes a copier introduced
Wednesday will save the encyclopedias, dictionaries and other books
in libraries around the country from broken-binding syndrome.
   The Xerox 5042 has a slanted edge and a hinged cover that allow a
book or other bound material to be laid flat without squashing or
stretching the binding.
   ``We've responded very directly to a market need,'' said Paul
Cahn, vice president of reprographics product support for Xerox's
U.S. Marketing Group.
   Xerox officials said their studies found that libraries spent
about $40 million in 1985 to repair broken book bindings.
   ``This is very much of a niche kind of product, but it's the kind
of thing that will give Xerox a presence in places it wants to be,
like universities and libraries, where a lot of people will see
their name,'' said Bob Sostilio, a copier-industry analyst with
Dataquest Inc., of San Jose, Calif.
   The 5042 makes 35 copies a minute and can make reductions and
enlargements. It sells for $9,470.
   The machine also features a vending attachment that accepts
coins, bills and magnetic cards.
   ``We have offered vending before, but it was just coins,'' said
Jim Miller, Xerox's manager of decentralized product marketing.
``And librarians told us they were tired of spending their whole day
making change for people.''
   The American Library Association asked copier companies to come
up with a copier that wouldn't damage books and would make better
copies of bound materials.
   Xerox is one of two companies to offer a machine built with
libraries in mind.
   The other manufacturer, Oce Business Systems of Venlo,
Netherlands, introduced two library copiers in January, said company
spokesman John James.
   Also on Wednesday, Xerox introduced two new low-volume copiers
that are designed to keep the company ahead in that highly
competitive segment of the market, which includes copiers that make
up to 30 copies a minute.
   All three machines were displayed at a news conference at the
company's major manufacturing center in the Rochester suburb of
Webster. Xerox is based in Stamford, Conn.

<HEAD>Agents Say Travelers Fleeing Eastern Bookings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK REYNA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Would-be travelers to and from South Florida and the
Caribbean were steering away from Eastern Airlines as the carrier's
Saturday strike deadline neared, travel agents said Wednesday.
   Agents said most customers were asking to change reservations or
turn in Eastern tickets. Eastern's largest union, the Machinists, is
poised for a strike if no contract settlement is reached by Friday
midnight.
   There has been a surge in ticket sales at Eastern's competitors,
said several agents interviewed Wednesday. Agents said participants
in Eastern's OnePass frequent flier program were for the most part
sticking with Eastern, but the agents were reluctant to book other
customers on the carrier.
   Eastern says anybody with a ticket for an Eastern flight that is
cancelled will get a refund or a seat on another airline.
   Besides confusing travelers in Eastern's major markets _ South
Florida, the Caribbean, the East Coast and Latin America _ the
looming strike has also raised the specter of disruption of South
Florida's lucrative ocean cruise business.
   At Miami's Happy Holidays Travel, which does about 30 percent of
its business in Eastern tickets, ``Most of them (customers) phone up
and say right away: `Please try and get me another airline,''' said
manager Beatrix Mompoint.
   ``A lot of people (are) calling up asking not to be put on
Eastern,'' said a travel agent at Miami's Barry White Travel Agent
Inc. who identified herself only as Agnes.
   In Washington, Michael DiPietro of Esplanade Travel reported that
his company remained ``hesitant'' about booking with Eastern ``until
we learn more about what is going to happen.''
   He said his agency is only booking Eastern if clients
specifically request the troubled airline.
   Even travel agents actively booking seats on Eastern said they
only do so with a warning to customers.
   Agent Galen Wightman of Capitol Hill Travel Associates said his
Washington-based company was advising customers of the possibility
of a strike, and warning that alternative arrangements might have to
be made at the last minute.
   Mompoint said agents at Happy Holidays inform customers that
Eastrern tickets `usually get accepted'' by other airlines in the
event of a strike.
   At Eastern, airline spokeswoman Cori Zywotow pledged disruption
caused by a strike would be kept to a minimum.
   ``Eastern will refund tickets on cancelled flights,'' she said.
``If you want your money back, you'll receive a full refund.''
   According to Zywotow, agreements between Eastern and other major
airlines stipulate that tickets which are endorsed by Eastern for
travel on another airline will be honored by other carriers at no
additional cost.
   That accord, she said, also covers discount-fare tickets
purchased from Eastern.
   The effectiveness of the inter-line agreement, however, was being
called into question by several other airlines _ including Pan
American World Airways, USAir, American Airlines and Trans World
Airlines, all of which have reportedly withheld unconditional
acceptance of Eastern tickets pending their own reviews of the
situation.
   Some airline analysts have said Eastern might seek protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code,
which would make it difficult for other carriers to be compensated.
   South Florida's cruise lines, which carry each year nearly 4
million passengers _ most of them flown in from around the country
and abroad _ could also be adversely affected by a strike at Eastern.

<HEAD>Texas Eastern Selling Exploration-Production Holdings for $1.4 Billion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Texas Eastern Corp.'s oil and gas production and
exploration units will be sold for about $1.4 billion to a British
concern to help finance a friendly takeover by Panhandle Eastern
Corp., Panhandle announced Wednesday.
   The agreement with Enterprise Oil PLC was reached just days after
the two Houston natural gas companies signed a $3.2 billion merger
agreement.
   ``They were able to reach this deal so quickly because the sale
to Enterprise had been under consideration by Texas Eastern before
Panhandle Eastern made its offer to acquire the company,'' Panhandle
Eastern spokesman Jim Hart said.
   The sale to Enterprise Oil includes Texas Eastern's holdings in
the United Kingdom and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, Denmark,
Indonesia, the Netherlands and Alaska, Panhandle Eastern said.
   The holdings include 13 producing oil and gas fields, six fields
that are under development and 14 undeveloped fields.
   Enterprise Oil is an independent oil and gas exploration and
production company, according to a notice of the proposed
acquisition. If the purchase is approved, Enterpise said it would
become the leading independent oil exploration and production
company in the North Sea in terms of reserves, production and
acreage.
   Panhandle Eastern's Feb. 20 merger agreement included a provision
to sell non-pipeline assets to help finance the acquisition.
Panhandle Eastern officials said the sale announced Wednesday was a
big step toward that goal.
   Robert D. Hunsucker, chairman, president and chief executive
officer at Panhandle Eastern, said his company approved the sale
under terms of the merger agreement.
   Hunsucker said Panhandle Eastern expected the sale to net more
than $1.2 billion after taxes, with proceeds to be used to help pay
off most of $1.7 billion in short-term loans taken for the Texas
Eastern buyout.
   ``The $1.4 billion sale price meets our expectations and is
completely in line with what our financial analysis revealed,''
Hunsucker said in a statement.
   The sale is expected to be complete in 60 to 90 days, officials
said, and is subject to approval by Enterprise Oil shareholders and
the British government.
   Texas Eastern and Panhandle Eastern officials said last week that
Texas Eastern's 44 percent share in Petrolane Partners also could be
sold within 60 days after the merger is complete.
   The master limited partnership, formed through the company's
Petrolane Inc. subsidiary in 1987, serves the international liquid
petroleum gas market.
   Panhandle Eastern is financing 80 percent, or $2.6 billion, of
its $3.2 billion takeover along with $1.05 billion in refinancing
and working capital, Hart said. The $1.7 billion in interim
financing is included in the figures.
   Panhandle Eastern's $53-a-share cash tender offer came weeks
after Texas Eastern rejected as inadequate Houston-based Coastal
Corp.'s $2.6 billion takeover bid.
   Coastal Corp. has extended its offer but has not said whether it
intends to increase the $42-a-share cash bid.

   The energy futures market ended mixed in moderate
trading Wednesday, with crude oil and wholesale home heating oil
prices rising and unleaded gasoline falling slightly.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 13 cents
higher at $18.28 a barrel, after gaining a penny on Tuesday. Other
contract months increased.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, heating
oil for April delivery settled at 50.49 cents a gallon, up 0.30
cent. The contract had fallen 0.20 cent Tuesday.
   April unleaded gasoline, which rose 0.14 cent in the previous
session, fell 0.01 cent to 51.56 cents a gallon. Other contract
months were mostly lower.
   William Byers, an energy analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.,
attributed Wednesday's market activity largely to the latest
American Petroleum Institute data released late Tuesday.
   The API report showed a small buildup of gasoline and oil
supplies and a decline in heating oil.

   Stock prices slumped in late trading Wednesday,
giving up an early gain under the pressure of renewed interest-rate
worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points
in the early going, closed with a 15.35 loss at 2,243.04.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
633 up, 816 down and 522 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 177.21 million
shares, up from 147.43 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 209.93 million shares.
   Analysts noted that the market had shown signs since the start of
the week of recovering from the jolt it suffered last week as a
result of bad news on inflation and a round of interest-rate
increases.
   The upswing continued as rates declined modestly in the bond and
short-term money markets Wednesday morning.
   But then the bond market gave up its gains as traders studied a
government report showing stronger-than-expected gains in personal
income for January.
   By late afternoon, prices of long-term government bonds, which
move in the opposite direction from interest rates, showed losses of
about $5 for eaach $1,000 in face value. And stocks followed the
bond market's lead.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1| at 119~; General Electric, down \ at 45; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down \ at 30, and Union Carbide, down { at
29{.
   Coca-Cola rose \ to 48 and Columbia Pictures Entertainment was up
1\ at 18. There were reports that Coca-Cola had been approached by
several parties interested in acquiring its 49 percent stake in
Columbia Pictures Entertainment.
   AAR gained 1] to 27{ on expectations that the company's aviation

   The dollar rose broadly Wednesday, benefiting
from weakness in the British pound.
   Gold prices pulled back in domestic and overseas dealings.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $383.80 for a
troy ounce of gold bullion at 4 p.m. EST, down from $387 late
Tuesday.
   ``The weakness of the pound pushed the dollar and the deutsche
mark higher,'' said John McCarthy, chief dealer at the Amsterdam
Rotterdam Bank in New York.
   Sterling suffered due to unexpectedly bad figures on Britain's
trade performance during January and persistent doubts about
Britain's overall economic health.
   Currency dealers dumped pounds after release of the trade report.
In an effort to counter the sell-off, the Bank of England, the
country's central bank, intervened in the market, buying pounds.
   One pound cost $1.7243 in London late Wednesday, nearly 2 cents
cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.7430. It was the pound's
lowest level since Oct. 11, when sterling stood at $1.7175.
   Later, the pound ended in New York at $1.72325, down from $1.7430
Tuesday.
   In the United States, dealers bid up the value of the mark on the
grounds that West German monetary authorities soon might raise
interest rates to reduce economic activity and relieve inflationary
pressures.
   European dealers had earlier sold marks amid speculation there
that prospects for higher West German interests have diminished, due
partly to the currency's strength.
   In Tokyo trading, which ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 127.68 Japanese yen, up from 127.15. Late
Wednesday in London the dollar traded higher at 128.15 yen, and in
New York the dollar finished at 128.225 yen, up from 126.89 on
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
levels, included: 1.83675 West German marks, up from 1.82275;
1.56875 Swiss francs, up from 1.5549; 1.19875 Canadian dollars; down
from 1.19925; 6.2495 French francs, up from 6.2035; and, 1,354.25
Italian lire, up from 1,341.75.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.8390 West German marks, up from
1.8230; 1.5705 Swiss francs, up from 1.5535; 6.2575 French francs,
up from 6.1975; 2.0755 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0555; 1,354.75
Italian lire, up from 1,341.50; and 1.1985 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2005.
   Gold bullion prices slid.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $384.30 a troy ounce, down from $387.50 on
Tuesday.
   In London, the major European precious metals market, gold closed
at $384.25 bid a troy ounce, down from $386.75. The closing price in
Zurich was $384.10 bid, down from $387.15.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $388.26, down from
$388.85.
   Silver prices also declined.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery closed at $5.744
a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's settlement of $5.822. Silver
bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.79 a troy ounce, down from
$5.86.

<HEAD>Computer Chip Plant Could Eventually Produce 1,200 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEE'S SUMMIT, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision by Alliance Semiconductor
Corp. to manufacture computer memory chips in this Kansas City
suburb could eventually create more than 1,200 jobs, Gov. John
Ashcroft said Wednesday.
   Ashcroft announced at a news conference that the San Jose,
Calif.-based company will lease vacant space at the former AT&amp;T
Microelectronics plant in Lee's Summit. AT&amp;T continues to
manufacture electronic components at the plant.
   Missouri officials said Alliance is receiving $8.42 million in
start-up financing from public and private sources.
   Alliance said it hopes eventually to employ more than 1,200
workers in two ``clean rooms'' at the plant but said it will need
financial backing to meet that goal. Clean rooms are immaculate work
places designed designed to allow precise manufacturing of minute
equipment.
   The company expects to hire as many as 300 people in the next
year to make chips in one of the 22,000-square-foot clean rooms, but
expansion into the second room and additional employment will depend
upon Alliance getting another $40 million to $50 million in
financing, President N.D. Reddy said after a press conference at the
AT&amp;T plant.
   Reddy said the start-up financing will get initial manufacturing
started, but more cash will be needed if Alliance is to expand and
thrive. He said Alliance hopes to raise the financing, possibly
through a public stock offering, within a year.
   Alliance, which was established in 1985, consists of 10 people
working out of offices in San Jose. The company has licensed a
Japanese company, NMB Semiconductor, to make the fast memory chips
Alliance has designed. The Lee's Summit plant would be Alliance's
only wholly owned manufacturing site.
   The plant will make static random access memory chips (SRAMs) and
eventually dynamic random access memory chips, also called DRAMs.
SRAMs are faster but more expensive than the more common DRAMs.
Japan dominates the world market for computer memory chips.
   Alliance will invest $250,000 in the start-up, while the
remainder will come from other investors.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Leap On Peruvian Strike, Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices soared Wednesday amid supply concerns
prompted by labor unrest in Peru and underlined by the small number
of copper delivery notices posted on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   On other exchanges, precious-metals futures prices plummeted;
soybean futures dropped sharply; and grain, energy, and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Copper settled 3.9 cents to 8.8 cents higher on the Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in March at $1.455 a pound,
the highest settlement price for the March contract since Jan. 27
but still well below the record high for spot copper of $1.6475 a
pound reached Dec. 8 on the exchange.
   The rally was sparked by news that miners in Peru, the world's
sixth-largest copper producer, would consider extending a planned
3-day strike if conditions warrant. The strike is scheduled to begin
on March 26.
   The reports stirred memories of last fall's 57-day Peruvian
mining strike, which was a major factor in copper's rise to record
price levels.
   Demand for copper remains strong and supplies continue to be
tight, a situation reflected in the slim number of delivery notices
posted Tuesday and Wednesday on the exchange.
   The delivery notices signify the intent of commercial traders to
deliver copper against the March contract, which expires on March
29. A small number of delivery notices would indicate a reluctance
or inability among copper processors to deliver the metal,
suggesting that their own supplies are limited.
   Only three delivery notices were issued Tuesday, the first notice
day, and none were posted on Wednesday.
   Analysts said the market's bullish supply-and-demand factors and
strong chart signals could lead to another run at record price
levels.
   ``It's starting to look like a replay of 1987 and 1988,'' when
copper prices reached their last two peaks, said Fred Demler, metals
economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   Platinum led a steep sell-off in precious-metals futures as the
strengthening dollar and rising interest rates spurred a further
retreat of investors from precious metals, a traditional hedge
against inflation.
   Platinum settled $9.30 to $9.80 lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange with April at $531.10 a troy ounce. On the Commodity
Exchange, gold settled $3.30 to $3.70 lower with April at $387.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 8 cents to 10.1 cents lower with March at
$5.744 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures dropped sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid forecasts for rain in Argentina's soybean fields.
   Wheat futures advanced modestly due to an increase in export
business while corn futures finished mixed.
   The soybean sell-off also reflected a steep increase Wednesday in
the number of delivery notices posted against the March contract.
   Wheat settled 1} cents to 4 cents higher with March at $4.39\ a
bushel; corn was } cent lower to } cent higher with March at $2.71}
a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 2{ cents lower with March at $2.02} a
bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents to 12{ cents lower with March at
$7.50{ a bushel.
   Crude oil futures posted modest gains on the New York Mercantile
Exchange but prices for refined products ended narrowly mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents to 13 cents
higher with April at $18.28 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent lower
to .30 cent higher with April at 50.49 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .08 cent lower to .30 cent higher with April at 51.56
cents a gallon.
   Expectations of a demand slump weighed on the cattle futures
market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange while pork futures gained
in a technically inspired rally.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .78 cent lower with April at
77.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .28 cent lower
with March at 82.52 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent to .65
cent lower with April at 44.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .20 cent to .50 cent lower with March at 38.67 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   A highly successful U.S. government campaign to
give American tobacco companies a share of the lucrative Asian
market is prompting congressional complaints that federal agencies
are ``exporting death.''
   A bipartisan group of congressmen plans to introduce legislation
Thursday that would forbid the government from going to bat for the
cigarette industry overseas.
   ``The message we are sending is that Asian lungs are more
expendable than American lungs,'' says Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.
   Says Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., ``If we are as sensitive as we
are about the health of American consumers, this certainly looks
like an outrageous double standard.''
   Levine and Atkins will be joined by Rep. Bob Whittaker, R-Kan.,
and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment, in introducing
the legislation.
   Tobacco exports mushroomed during the Reagan administration as a
result of a highly effective campaign against foreign trade barriers
by the U.S. special trade representative's office and other agencies.
   U.S. tobacco sales to Asia increased by 76 per cent in 1987.
Tobacco-related earnings worldwide totaled about $2.5 billion.
   Atkins sees th overseas sale of American cigarettes as a health
issue _ ``exporting death,'' he calls it. But his detractors in the
tobacco industry and elsewhere regard it as a trade issue that takes
on crucial importance because of the country's huge, albeit
declining, trade deficit. The deficit for 1988 was $137.3 billion.
   Under the draft legislation, the president would be prevented
from seeking the ``removal or reduction by any foreign country of
any restrictions'' on the advertising, manufacture, packaging,
importation, sale or distribution of tobacco products.
   Gary Miller, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, which
promotes the industry's interests, says other countries are
``perfectly capable of determining and applying rules and
regulations regarding tobacco products, and they don't need the U.S.
Congress stepping in to provide guidelines on how to handle that
product in their own country.''
   The legislation also would require all exported tobacco to carry
either a surgeon general's warning about the hazards of smoking or a
comparable warning established by the importing country.
   Says Mark Eaton, an aide to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a stalwart
backer of the tobacco industry, ``We certainly think that as long as
tobacco is a legal product we will fight to see that it can take
advantage of the same agricultural export programs that other
commodities receive.''
   The U.S. government apparently operates with two minds about the
propriety of promoting tobacco exports.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop says, ``I don't think that we as
citizens can continue to tolerate exporting disease, disability and
death.''
   But Peter Allgeier, assistant U.S. trade representative for Asia
and the Pacific, has a different view.
   Allgeier did not return a reporter's phone call but was quoted in
the New York Times as saying, ``It's not as though we are
introducing Asia to tobacco. The Chinese manufacture and consume 1.3
trillion cigarettes annually.
   ``The market in Tiwan and Korea was established long before any
trade negotiations, and they're going to smoke whether the U.S. is
exporting cigarettes or not.''
   From all appearances, Allgeier has more clout than Koop. Allgeier
has been the point man for the campaign to help tobacco companies
gain access to previously restricted markets in East Asia.
   Allgeier's lever was Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974,
which gives the government the authority to impose sanctions against
any nation whose trade policies are ``unjustifiable, unreasonable or
discriminatory.''
   Under threat of retaliatory U.S. tariffs, Japan opened its doors
to foreign cigarettes in October 1986. According to World Watch
magazine, U.S. cigarette exports to Japan quadrupled.
   Under similar U.S. pressure, South Korea and Taiwan also dropped
their restrictions on foreign cigarettes.
   Miller, the Tobacco Institute spokesman, said overall cigarette
consumption has been declining in Asia. The World Watch article,
written by Lori Heise, says there has been a 5 per cent increase in
cigarette consumption in Taiwan since the restrictions were dropped.
   A U.S. government publication, World Situation and Tobacco
Report, says that after advertising for U.S. cigarette commercials
began saturating Japanese television, cigarette sales in Japan
increased 2 per cent, reversing a 20-year downward trend.
   Gregory Connally, who returned this week from a 10-day trip to
Asia on behalf of the American Cancer Society, says the U.S.
government should do less for the tobacco industry and more for food
exporters.
   ``We're using valuable trading chits for a product that has no
nutritional value,'' he says.
   While American beef, wheat, rice and citrus products are denied
access to many Asian countries, he says, ``Marlboros and Winstons
are going to Taiwan and South Korea.''

<HEAD>Analysts: Premier May Pave Way For Cigarette Revolution, Despite
Failure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS PATTERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc.'s high-tech, smokeless
cigarette may have been pulled from test markets, but some analysts
said Wednesday the experimental smokes could start the same sort of
product revolution that Tab did for diet soft drinks 20 years ago.
   ``I think down the road it will do real well,'' said Eric Garner,
a vice president in the Charlotte office of Carolinas Securities.
``It's a little rough, but I think the concept is good and in the
next 25 years we're going to see more companies go to this.''
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco announced Tuesday it was withdrawing its
Premier brand after five months of test marketing in Arizona and
Missouri. Smokers complained that the cigarette, which used a carbon
heat source to pull warm air over a flavor capsule and dried
tobacco, had a bad taste and smell.
   ``Everyone I know who tried it thought it was really horrible,''
said Pavlos M. Alexandrakis, who follows tobacco companies for Argus
Research Corp. in New York.
   Garner, himself a smoker, said he had tried one of the cigarettes
when RJR made a presentation to investment groups. The flavor, he
said, ``was less than thrilling, that's about all I can say.''
   ``It was a very strange thing, if you're a smoker,'' Garner said.
``There were no ashes, but you kept flicking it out of habit. It had
a strange taste because you weren't burning any tobacco, just
drawing air through it.''
   Despite his own experience with Premiers, Garner said he expects
to see similar innovations in the future.
   ``I remember the first Tabs, how terrible they were,'' Garner
said. ``They tasted just awful, but now you have diet Coke, diet
Pepsi, all these diet drinks. It really was a revolutionary product.
   ``More new products fail than succeed, so Premier's failure _ and
I'm not sure it's a total failure _ is not really surprising,'' he
said. ``You try to find out what's wrong with a product in your test
marketing and they've obviously been given some things to work on.
   ``I'm sure they'll take it back to the lab and keep tampering
with it and monkeying around with it and they'll come up with
something pretty good,'' he said. ``The consumer will tell them if
they've worked it out somewhere down the road.''
   ``This is no surprise,'' said industry analyst Emanuel Goldman.
``It was brought out stillborn.''
   Goldman, who works for PaineWebber Inc., said Premier suffered
from two fatal problems: unacceptable taste and aroma.
   ``What the company was saying was consumers will get used to it,
they'll give it an extra try,'' he said. ``That's inconsistent with
the fact that we are a nation of channel-hoppers, and if you don't
like it the first time, you're not going to try it a second time.''
   Tobacco growers initially were uneasy with Premiers because they
used significantly less tobacco than regular cigarettes, but Carlton
Blalock, executive director of the Tobacco Growers Association of
North Carolina, said he doubts farmers will be jumping up and down
with joy over Premier's demise.
   ``Everybody said from the start it would have been better had it
been a product that used more tobacco than a regular cigarette,''
Blalock said. ``But I felt like on balance it might have worked out.
   ``The cigarette had potential had it proven to be acceptable by
the public because of some of the features that it offered,
especially on sidestream smoke and the fire safety issue,'' he said.
``Had that ... been accepted as fully as it potentially might have
been, it could have more than offset the amount of tobacco used in
the cigarette.
   ``Anytime somebody in the industry tries something new and it
doesn't work out, you're a little disappointed because it well could
have a positive impact on tobacco growers down the road,'' he said.
``My guess is that they (RJR) will continue working on it. It
certainly would not make sense for them just to shelve it after all
the investment that's been put into it.''

<HEAD>Pipeline to Tap Oklahoma Natural Gas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp. of Houston and Arkla Inc. of
Shreveport, La., announced a major pipeline expansion Wednesday that
will open up markets in the Northeast and the Midwest to the
prolific Arkoma Basin in eastern Oklahoma.
   Officials said the the project will ultimately mean an extra 450
million cubic feet per day of natural gas can be moved to the
Midwest and Northeast.
   They estimated that would increase the sales of Oklahoma gas by
$300 million.
   Officials said most of the capacity expansion will come from a
new 200-mile pipeline originating in Latimer County in eastern
Oklahoma and terminating in Jefferson County, Ark.
   They said the 30-inch diameter pipeline will provide substantial
additional capacity across Oklahoma and Arkansas to the Southeast
Mainline of ANR Pipeline Co., a Coastal subsidiary.
   Estimated cost of the new pipeline was set at $120 million.
Officials said it could be in service by as early as mid-1990.
   The announcement was made at a news conference attended by
Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon, James F. Cordes, executive vice
president of Coastal, and Mike Bracy, president of Arkla's Pipeline
Group.
   Cordes said officials believe the new pipeline will allow
Oklahoma gas to be sold at a competitive price with natural gas from
Canada.
   Bracy said the first phase of the project will kick off next
month.
   ``From Coastal's prospective, these agreements have three major
benefits,'' Cordes said. ``First, we will substantially improve our
ability to move gas out of Oklahoma by providing greatly expanded
transportation and pipeline links between our Southwest and
Southeast pipeline facilities.
   ``Second, by using our newly proposed connections in Ohio to the
major pipelines serving the Northeast, Oklahoma producers will gain
direct access to this major growing gas market.
   ``Third, our ANR Pipeline subsidiary will gain access to the
increasingly important gas supplies in the Arkoma Basis to meet the
requirements of its customers in the future.''
   Bracy said the project allows Arkla to strengthen its access to
new markets ``while at the same time increasing the efficiency of
our existing pipeline system, which will benefit our current
customers and producers.''
   The extra sales of Oklahoma gas will mean an additional $21
million in gross production taxes for the state, officials said.
Those taxes go principally to the state teacher retirement program.

<HEAD>Judge Reserves Ruling In Poultry Takeover Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware Chancery Court judge declined
to rule Wednesday on a request by Tyson Foods Inc. to block Holly
Farms Inc. from holding a shareholders' vote on its proposed merger
with ConAgra Inc.
   Tyson Foods, the nation's largest poultry producer, has fought a
four-month battle to acquire Memphis, Tenn.-based Holly Farms, a
diversified company that is the country's fifth-largest poultry
producer.
   Tyson asked the court to stop Holly Farms from proceeding with a
shareholders' meeting to vote on the buyout.
   Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett III said
after a hearing that he would reserve his ruling on the request. He
did not say when the ruling could be expected.
   Holly Farms, which has twice spurned takeover offers from Tyson,
has reached agreement to merge with Omaha, Neb.-based ConAgra, but
the deal has been blocked in court.
   Tyson, based in Springdale, Ark., has offered $60 per share in
cash in a buyout valued at more than $1 billion. ConAgra has
proposed a stock swap valued at about $1 billion.
   The agreement would allow ConAgra to purchase key assets of Holly
Farms if the deal fails.
   Tyson argued that a shareholders' vote would be coercive and
would cause irreparable harm to shareholders.
   ``We've put our money where our mouth is _ and where it is is $85
million higher than the ConAgra offer,'' said Tyson attorney
Jonathon J. Lerner.
   Holly Farms attorney Kenneth Nachbar argued that shareholders
would be hurt if they were not allowed to vote on the merger.
   ``If the vote goes forward the shareholders could vote against
ConAgra. That's the way for a decision to be made,'' said Kenneth
Nachbar, attorney for Holly Farms. ``This is the best business
decision.''
   ConAgra's offer expires May 1.

<HEAD>Board of Trade Computer System Will Improve Audit Trail, Chairman
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade is moving to employ a
computerized, off-hours trading system for competitive reasons, but
its proposed new system will provide a ``significantly improved
audit trail'' for regulating its members, the market's chairman said
Wednesday.
   In a 20-minute speech to the Chicago division of the Futures
Industry Association, Karsten Mahlmann said the Board of Trade
within weeks would publicly unveil its proposed electronic
auction-market system.
   Mahlmann said the new computerized trading method would be more
than a system for matching orders and claimed it would surpass the
Globex trading system being developed by the rival Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``The system to the greatest extent possible replicates the
trading pit as we all know it today,'' Mahlmann said.
   The Board of Trade informed its members 2{ weeks ago that it was
planning to implement the computerized system for trading during
hours when the market's trading floor is closed.
   Its purpose then was described as primarily to give foreign
investors easier access to the Board of Trade's increasing market
for U.S. Treasury bond futures, members said.
   Industry observers have said the move into computerized trading
by the Board of Trade appearently was prompted by a widespread
federal investigation of suspected fraud at the Board of Trade and
the Merc.
   But Mahlmann indicated Wednesday that market pressures were the
primary motivation.
   ``Knowing that our competitors were developing a computerized
trading system, we privately proceeded to develop our own,'' he said.
   ``If I were president of the United States...and I knew that my
neighbor competitor had a nuclear bomb, I would have no alternative
but to also develop such a weapon,'' he said.
   ``I may prefer other strategies to nuclear weapons, and I may not
necessarily use them, but I simply cannot afford to have the weapon
not in my arsenal,'' he said.
   But Mahlmann also said ``a significantly improved audit trail''
would result from a new electronic order-entry system to allow
greater regulation with minimal increased costs to members.
   Like Globex, the Board of Trade's system is to use a computer to
match orders to buy and sell contracts for future deliveries of
financial instruments. Also, like Globex, the system will be open to
other futures exchanges that wish to list their products for trading.
   But unlike Globex, which the Merc is developing in partnership
with London-based Reuters PLC, the Board of Trade system is to be
developed and owned entirely by the exchange and its members.
   Mahlmann emphasized the differences Wednesday, saying, ``It has
become obvious to me, at least, and to the exchange, that the
technology used in Globex is outdated, and as that, extremely
costly...to market users.''

<TEXT>
   Americans' personal income in January posted
its largest gain in more than a year, rising 1.8 percent, but people
chose not to spend much of the extra money and instead built up
their savings, the government reported Wednesday.
   Analysts were cautious about whether the report might signal the
start of a long-sought slowdown in consumer spending, which would
help cool inflationary pressures in the economy, and said the robust
income figures suggested continued strength in the economy.
   On Wall Street, stock prices slumped in late trading, giving up
an early gain under the pressure of renewed interest-rate worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed with a 15.35-point
loss at 2,243.04. Five stocks fell for every four that rose in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
   Bond prices fell sharply with actively-traded 30-year issues
losing $5 for every $1,000 in face value.
   But the dollar rose broadly in foreign exchange trading.
   Led by increases in wages and salaries reflecting strong
employment gains, income rose $74 billion to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $4.28 trillion in January, the Commerce Department
reported.
   Personal consumption spending, meanwhile, edged up just 0.1
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.35 trillion. The
figure includes virtually all consumer spending except interest
payments on debt.
   At the same time, Americans added to their savings at an annual
rate of $211 billion.
   With the income gain strongly outpacing the rise in spending, the
personal savings rate rose to 5.8 percent from 4.3 percent in
December. It was the highest savings rate since May 1985, when
Americans set aside 6.5 percent of their disposable income.
   Analysts found the weak spending figure surprising in light of
the strong income growth and were divided about whether it marked
the start of a trend toward slower consumer spending.
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of
Manufacturers, said the figures were ``welcome news, suggesting that
fears of the economy overheating were unfounded.''
   But Lea Tyler, senior economist for the Wefa Group, a Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm, said it was too early ``to talk about
consumers really retrenching.''
   Ms. Tyler said that if strong employment figures continue to
drive income upward, it could ``raise some concerns about inflation
in the coming year.''
   The Federal Reserve Board since last March has been pushing
interest rates up in an effort to slow the economy and dampen
inflationary pressures. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has singled out
higher wage pressures in the economy as part of the cause of
accelerating inflation.
   Just last week, the central bank boosted its key bank lending
rate a half-percentage-point to 7 percent after worries about
inflation were heightened by a report that consumer prices shot up
0.6 percent in January.
   Consumer spending rose at a robust 3.5 percent annual rate last
year, a pace that analysts said is too fast given constraints on
production caused by high operating rates and tight labor markets.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said January's income and spending report sent mixed
signals, with the strong income gain suggesting ``the economy was
continuing to race ahead too fast,'' while the spending pace
suggests ``a much more restrained pattern'' that would be welcome.
   Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington said it was
possible that January's weak consumer spending figure may be one of
``the first signs that higher interest rates are taking their toll''
on consumer spending.
   However, Ms. Shaber said the figures more likely signaled that
``people are better able to save'' after enjoying sustained
increases in income over the last year.
   In another report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said
construction spending increased 0.4 percent in January, led by a
strong increase in work on non-residential buildings and held back
by a decrease in work on government projects.
   Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$424 billion in January, following a 2.1 percent increase in
December and a 1.3 percent jump in November.
   January's increase in personal income was the biggest monthly
increase since a 2 percent jump in October 1987, while the slim rise
in spending was the weakest performance since a 1.5 percent decrease
in September.
   The increase in income was paced by a 1.2 percent gain in the key
component of wages and salaries, reflecting continued strong
employment.
   The recent income gains were bolstered by several unusual
factors, including a 4.1 percent pay raise in January for federal
civilian and military personnel, a 4 percent cost-of-living increase
in Social Security benefits in January and a December increase in
farm subsidy payments, the Commerce Department said.
   Even excluding such factors, however, personal income still
increased 1.6 percent in January and 0.8 percent in December.
   Americans' disposable, or after-tax, incomes rose 1.7 percent in
January after rising 0.9 percent in December and falling 0.3 percent
in November.

<TEXT>
   Western Union Corp. Wednesday
reported a $244 million loss in fourth-quarter earnings, which the
telecommunications company attributed to restructuring charges
connected with a change of services.
   Western Union said the fourth-quarter loss compared to a net gain
of $105 million, or $3.99 per share, in 1987's fourth quarter.
   Sales in the final quarter of 1988 were $186.5 million, compared
to revenues of $190.9 million for the same period of 1987.
   For the year, the company said it lost $1.08 billion on revenues
of $875.9 million. That compares to a net income of $88 million, or
$2.58 a share, on revenues of $801.8 million in 1987, the company
said.
   The restructuring charges went to equipment writeoffs, severance
pay and other costs related to the company's transition ``from a
facilities-based operator of domestic telecommunications
transmission services to its role as an international provider of
value-added messaging, financial and other services,'' said Robert
J. Amman, Western Union president and chief executive.
   The company's stock closed at $2 on the New York Stock Exchange
Wednesday, up 12 cents from Tuesday.

   Amtrak will open the first major new
rail route in its 18-year history when it begins service to Atlantic
City on May 23, anticipating 1.4 million new riders a year,
officials announced Wednesday.
   The ``Atlantic City Express,'' more commonly called the
``Gamblers Express,'' will include five round-trips on weekdays and
several more round-trips on the weekends, said Timothy P. Gardner,
Amtrak's vice president of marketing. One direct line will originate
in Washington and another will start in New York, he said.
   Amtrak has added new cities and frequencies to its existing rail
network, but never before created an entirely new route, said Amtrak
spokesman John Jacobsen.
   NJ Transit has delayed commuter service on the rail line until
1991. NJ Transit officials announced funding cutbacks Tuesday to
meet a projected budget deficit.
   But Gardner said NJ Transit's delay would not affect Amtrak's
start.
   ``New Jersey Transit has been extremely cooperative in getting
the physical plant assembled,'' he said. ``Even if they end up
postponing their (commuter) service for a year, it will not affect
our plans.''
   Passenger service into the seaside resort was stopped in 1982
because of low ridership and poor track conditions.
   Amtrak, NJ Transit and the Atlantic County Improvement Authority
are sharing costs on the $101 million new rail project, including
repairing the old tracks and building a new Atlantic City terminal
and local stations.
   Amtrak expects to bring in revenue of about $30 million a year,
Gardner said.
   Tentative Amtrak fares include a $25 round-trip charge between
Atlantic City and Philadelphia; a $49 round-trip from Washington;
and a $46 round-trip from New York, Gardner said. An express trip to
New York would take 2{ hours, he said.

   A federal judge Wednesday refused to dismiss
charges or grant a mistrial in the GAF Corp. stock manipulation case
and defense lawyers called their first witnesses.
   GAF and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, are charged with
securities fraud and other criminal counts in an alleged scheme to
manipulate the price of Union Carbide Corp. stock in October 1986.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe denied defense motions to
dismiss the charges made Tuesday, finding that ``the government has
offered sufficient evidence.''
   The judge also denied a defense request to declare a mistrial for
the second time. Lowe declared a mistrial Jan. 10, four weeks into
the case, because a prosecutor failed to disclose a report that
concluded a major piece of evidence had been altered.
   After a new jury was selected, the second trial began Feb. 1 with
opening arguments at federal court in Manhattan.
   Legal and business observers consider the GAF trial significant
because it is the first courtroom test of information stemming from
the insider trading scandals that rocked Wall Street in the
mid-1980s.
   GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemicials and building materials
manufacturer, two subsidiaries and Sherwin were accused of
orchestrating a scheme to drive up the price of Union Carbide before
unloading 5 million shares acquired during an unsuccessful takeover
attempt.
   The main prosecution witness was Boyd L. Jefferies, former head
of a Los Angeles-based brokerage who struck a plea bargain with
prosecutors after being implicated by master insider trader Ivan
Boesky. Boesky, who is serving a 3-year prison sentence, did not
testify at the trial.
   After a securities fraud count was dismissed Tuesday, at
prosecutors' request, the defense sought to have the remaining eight
counts of stock manipulation, conspiracy, securities fraud and wire
fraud dismissed.
   The defense held that the government hadn't offered proof of
intent to induce investors to but stock. They sought a mistrial on
grounds that some of Jefferies' testimony, which was contradicted by
one of his associates, was hearsay.
   Lowe denied the request, however, and defense lawyers for Sherwin
called three character witnesses, including Leo Cherne, a
76-year-old lawyer and official of the International Rescue
Committee, which assists political refugees.
   Cherne said Sherwin, 54, of Princeton, N.J., had served on the
IRC's executive committee since the early 1970s with ``extraordinary
devotion and distinction.''
   The count dismissed Tuesday concerned the sale of 5 million
shares of Carbide stock in November 1986 to Salomon Brothers Inc.
The count was considered a complicating factor in an already complex
case, but Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Lowenson Jr. declined to
comment on why the government dropped the charge.
   Lowe said she expected to sequester the jury during their
deliberations, expected to begin late next week.

   Semi-Tech Microelectronics (Far East) Ltd. on
Wednesday increased its tender offer for SSMC Inc. to about $241
million, two days after a group led by Malaysian investor Vincent
Tan entered the bidding war for the Shelton, Conn.-based maker of
Singer sewing machines.
   Semi-Tech, a subsidiary of International Semi-Tech
Microelectronics Inc. of Toronto, said SSMC has consented to the new
offer of $34 a share, up from $30 a share originally offered.
   Semi-Tech would buy 5.4 million shares, or about 77 percent of
SSMC stock, with $34 a share in cash, then complete the merger by
exchanging the rest of the SSMC stock for preferred stock in the new
company.
   Semi-Tech extended its tender offer, previously scheduled to
expire at midnight EST Thursday, to March 14. The company, which is
making the offer through its STM Holdings Inc. unit, said that as of
the close of business yesterday, 49,873 SSMC common shares had been
tendered under the new offer.
   Tan's group, Berjaya Corp. (Malaysia) Berhad, on Monday announced
a $33-a-share tender offer. Berjaya already owns slightly less than
10 percent of SSMC's outstanding shares, giving its tender offer for
the remaining stock a value of about $211 million.
   Its offer expires at midnight EST on March 24.

   During the year, Woolworth opened or acquired 1,154 stores and
closed 214. Capital outlays in the year totaled a record amount,
$450 million, including $176 million for acquisitions.
   In addition to its Woolworth stores, the retailer owns more than

   The cold snap that heavily damaged northeast
Florida's potatoes and blighted other crops could drive up local
vegetable prices and put a crimp in the nation's potato chip supply
this spring, officials said Tuesday.
   The potato chip industry had been counting on an early and
abundant supply of potatoes from this area this spring to replinish
dwindling stocks, said Harold Willingham, southeastern area field
manager for Frito-Lay Inc.
   But now the freeze has turned what was expected to be a bonanza
into a season of gloom for potato farmers.
   ``As good as the crop was looking it would work out about right.
It was as much as three weeks early,'' Willingham said Monday from
his office in nearby Hastings.
   The 26,000 acres of potatoes St. Johns, Putnam and Flagler
counties in northeast Florida fill a niche in the supply of chip
potatoes for a few weeks each spring because they come in earlier
than other areas.
   Emergency boards in St. Johns and Flagler counties estimated that
10 percent of the potato fields had 100 percent loss, 10 percent had
no loss and 80 percent had from 10 to 50 percent loss.
   In Putnam County, the loss was 50 percent.
   However, Willingham said he couldn't ``envision there not being
enough potato chips on the shelves for consumers.''
   Doug Zant of the Agricultural Stablization and Conservation
Service in Gainesville said the counties have been asked to submit
reports that will be sent to the governor's office for a decision on
whether damage is sufficient to request federal disaster assistance.
   ``There is some severe damage. I think the percentage of loss
will go higher,'' said Bobby White, ASCS director for St. Johns and
Flagler counties.
   The attitude among potato farmers has gone ``from optimism to
gloom,'' said Austin Tilton, Putnam Countky extension director.
   The 5,000 acres of potato plants in Putnam County sustained heavy
losses because they had been planted early and were too big to cover
with dirt to protect them from the cold, Tilton said.
