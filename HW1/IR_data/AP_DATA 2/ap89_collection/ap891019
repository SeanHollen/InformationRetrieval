   First lady Barbara Bush on Thursday night
contradicted a published report that she weighs 135 pounds.
   ``George said the press never gets anything right,'' Mrs. Bush
said. ``Just for starters, I was born weighing 135 pounds.''
   Mrs. Bush addressed the 44th annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial
Dinner, a fund-raiser that has been called the city's most famous
non-political political event.
   Approximately 1,350 guests gathered in the Waldorf-Astoria
hotel's Grand Ballroom, where they dined on filet mignon and
chocolate hazelnut torte at $500 a plate.
   After straightening out the weight question, Mrs. Bush paused,
then handed outgoing Mayor Edward I. Koch, who was also on the
dais, one of his own lines.
   ``How'm I doing, Ed?''
   Mrs. Bush, wearing a black and purple gown with her
characteristic pearl choker, said she welcomed the chance ``to
prove I'm more than just a pretty face.''
   The glittering and often controversial Al Smith dinner always
draws an array of politicians and other notables, often held
shortly before a major election, though political hatchets are
supposed to be buried for the night.
   The first lady said she loved Tom Wolfe's satirical look at New
York politics and race relations, ``The Bonfire of the Vanities.''
   ``But I never dreamed I'd get to address some of the characters
in person,'' she said to cheers.
   This year's event drew the top contenders for City Hall,
Democrat David Dinkins and Republican Rudolph Giuliani, who sat two
seats apart on the dais and who, according to Giuliani, shook hands.
   At last year's dinner, then-Vice President George Bush and his
presidential opponent, Democrat Michael S. Dukakis, traded
witticisms just weeks before Bush won the race for the White House.
   Also in attendance Thursday were Alfred E. Smith IV, the master
of ceremonies; Gov. Mario Cuomo; New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean; state
Attorney General Robert Abrams; Fire Commissioner Joseph Bruno;
outgoing Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward and Cardinal John J.
O'Connor.
   The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has sponsored the
annual event since its inception in 1945, a year after Smith died.
The proceeds always go to health care causes.
   Smith, governor of New York from 1923-1928, in 1928 became the
first Catholic to be nominated for president.
   Past speakers have included John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic
elected president. Other speakers have been Winston S. Churchill,
Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Danny Thomas, Bob Hope and
Kurt Waldheim.

<HEAD>Gate Crashers Threaten Dilapidated Hall With Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A throng of gate crashers trampled spectators and
nearly brought the roof of the dilapidated Moscow Conservatory
crashing down in their desperation to hear the Italian opera
company La Scala, Izvestia reported.
   The government newspaper gave no account of casualties, however.
Moscow police refused comment Thursday evening, and managers of the
concert hall did not answer the telephone.
   In an article headlined, ``Requiem _ One Moment From Tragedy,''
Izvestia said in its Thursday editions that thousands of fans,
yearning to hear the La Scala orchestra and chorus perform Verdi's
Requiem, ``broke through a small cordon of police and rushed past
the old women ushers into the hall, trampling the bodies of fallen
spectators.''
   ``A brawl erupted between the ticket-holders and those without
tickets claiming their seats _ pirate connoisseurs of bel canto,''
it said.
   The newspaper blamed the crowd of unruly spectators for the
near-tragedy, but also noted that the downtown Moscow conservatory
had been closed for 1{ years as dangerously unstable.
   ``Under pressure of the public, taking into account the fact
that the capital happened to have no concert hall worthy of
celebrities, it was reopened on condition of careful use,'' the
newspaper said.
   On Wednesday night, ``the most terrible minutes came when the
hall exploded into chanting and the roof beams began to shake,''
Izvestia said.
   Every time maestro Riccardo Muti and the ensemble came out for
an encore, ``the new storm of applause was one more turn of the
deadly roulette wheel,'' it said.
   The newspaper noted that Mstislav Rostropovich and Vladimir
Ashkenazy, world-famous former students of the Moscow Conservatory,
are scheduled to play the hall in the future.

<TEXT>
   A court dismissed charges against a
teacher who whipped a 12-year-old boy so badly he had to be
hospitalized for six weeks, saying she did it help him improve his
grades, a newspaper reported today.
   The Korea Times said a court in the southern city of Taegu
dismissed assault charges this week against Kim Mi-kyong, 24, who
had been arrested for injuring the pupil.
   The teacher beat Park Kyong-jin with a stick because he had not
done well on a science test, the report said. The boy's back was
dislocated by the beating and was in the hospital for six weeks, it
said.
   The court ruled that corporal punishment was a necessary form of
discipline in schools and Miss Kim could not be charged with a
crime, the report said. The court also ruled the teacher was trying
to help the boy improve his grades and her actions were reasonable,
it said.

<HEAD>Fred Astaire's Widow Sues Columbia Over Film Distribution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of actor Fred Astaire has filed
suit against Columbia Pictures Entertainment over distribution of
royalties from two of his films.
   In a suit filed Wednesday in Superior Court, Robyn Astaire
claims Columbia owes her at least $25,000 in receipts from the
films ``You'll Never Get Rich'' and ``You Were Never Lovelier,'' in
which the famous dancer starred.
   She also seeks Columbia's accounting records regarding the
films' distribution.
   Mrs. Astaire alleges that since at least 1987, Columbia has
breached a contract under which Astaire was to receive 5 percent of
all net receipts in excess of $100,000 up to $5,000 and 10 percent
of all net receipts in excess of $200,000.
   Mrs. Astaire's attorney, Joseph F. Hart, said Thursday his
client does not know exactly how much money she is owed because
Columbia has refused to provide accounting records to her.
   He said the amount Columbia owes Mrs. Astaire may be
significantly higher than $25,000.
   Columbia officials could not be reached for comment after
business hours late Thursday.

<HEAD>Renewed Negotiations Fizzle Between Boeing and Machinists</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with talks called off. Edits to conform,

<TEXT>
   The first negotiations between the Boeing Co. and
union officials since nearly 60,000 workers went on strike fizzled
Wednesday after only four hours, and no new talks were scheduled,
both sides said.
   Boeing negotiators told the union through a federal mediator
that they would not expand the economic package rejected by union
members Oct. 3 but were willing ``to make adjustments within the
framework of the original wage offer,'' Boeing said in a news
release.
   ``Sounds like doubletalk,'' said union spokesman Jack Daniels
after the talks ended. ``Our people want more money and less
overtime.''
   The talks were the first since Oct. 2, two days before the
strike by members of the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers began.
   Daniels said Machinists District Lodge 751 members weren't
surprised by the lack of movement Wednesday.
   ``We figured after a couple of weeks of strike that the first
meeting would have to serve as a door opener to successive
meetings,'' Daniels said. ``Today the company was kind of doing its
tough guy act.''
   The Machinists represent about 57,800 Boeing workers nationwide,
including 43,300 covered by District Lodge 751 in the Puget Sound
area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few
hundred others at scattered sites in California, Hawaii, Montana,
Utah and other states.
   Asked if union members were feeling financial pressure, Tom
Baker, president of District Lodge 71, replied, ``I would think the
company's feeling the pressure pretty good since nobody's in there
(the airplane factories).''
   For Boeing, there have been growing reports of concern about
delayed aircraft deliveries to Malaysia Airlines, America West
Airlines and British Airways. Boeing, the world's largest
commercial airplane builder, has delivered seven planes during the
strike. The company has refused to say how many planes it would
have delivered normally.
   Eighty-five percent of the Machinists voted to strike rather
than take a three-year contract with wage increases of 4 percent, 3
percent and 3 percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the
first year and 3 percent the second; cost-of-living boosts
virtually matching inflation; a cut in mandatory overtime to 160
hours a quarter from 200 hours; and higher benefits.
   Baker said a new offer would have to provide more money,
benefits and cuts in mandatory overtime.
   An agreement would set a pattern for other labor negotiations at
Boeing, and traditionally sets the standard for the nation's
aerospace industry.

   A policeman who stole a life jacket
from the wreckage of a Boeing 737 jet that crashed in central
England in January was given a three-month prison sentence.
   Police Constable Kevin Wright had been sent to guard against
looters after the British Midland aircraft crashed short of East
Midlands Airport on Jan. 8, killing 47 of the 126 people on board.
   Prosecutor Nigel Rumfitt told Leicester Crown Court that Wright
took a life jacket from the wreckage and told colleagues, ``I've
got my souvenir.''
   After a three-day trial, the jury issued a 10-2 majority guilty
verdict. In handing down the sentence, Judge Christopher Young said
the public expected the police to uphold ``the highest standards of
honesty and integrity.''
   Wright, a village policeman for nine years, denied stealing. He
claimed he took the life jacket and a safety instruction card as a
joke and intended to return them.
   ``We were trying to be lighthearted among ourselves,'' he
testified. ``Some were cracking jokes, which is not easy at a time
like that, but it needs to be done.''

<HEAD>Amnesty Concerned About East Timor Arrests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International says it's concerned over the
fate of about 40 East Timorese reportedly arrested after a
pro-independence protest while Pope John Paul II was visiting the
former Portuguese colony last week.
   ``According to reports, some of those detained have been
subjected to ill-treatment, including electrical shocks, by members
of the (Indonesian) security forces,'' Amnesty said in a statement
issued in Rome on Wednesday.
   ``Amnesty International believes that in view of the consistent
and recurrent pattern of torture and ill-treatment of political
detainees in East Timor, those now in detention may be in serious
danger of ill-treatment.''
   The London-based human rights organization said the reports came
from previously reliable church and journalism sources in East
Timor, an Indonesian territory, and Australia.
   On Oct. 12, as the pope was finishing his blessing to a crowd of
100,000 people in Dili, capital of East Timor, about 20 young men
shouting ``Viva independence!'' and ``Viva il papa!,'' unfurled
banners in front of the altar.
   One banner read ``FRETILIN Welcomes You'' in Portuguese.
FRETILIN is the independence movement that has fought Indonesian
rule since annexation of East Timor in 1976.
   Plainclothesmen flogged the demonstrators and seized their
banners. The crowd scattered and about 100 more young men joined
the fray, hurling chairs at policemen.
   Indonesian authorities made no announcement about arrests.
   According to Amnesty, five East Timorese who feared arrest
reportedly took refuge at the home of Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos
Belo, apostolic administrator of Dili. Belo has criticized
Indonesia's human rights record in East Timor and called for a
referendum to decide its political future.
   The Vatican was closed for the day and the chief spokesman,
Joaquin Navarro, was not available for comment on the Amnesty
statement.
   He expressed skepticism this week about a report in a Portuguese
weekly that some of those arrested had been executed.

   Police said rescuers using dogs,
jackhammers and muscle found no survivors Wednesday in the rubble
of Interstate 880, the elevated road turned into a giant concrete
pancake and gnarled girders by the earthquake.
   More than 250 rush-hour commuters were feared buried in the
section of the Nimitz Freeway, which collapsed during Tuesday
evening's devestating 6.9-magnitude quake.
   Seven bodies were recovered by midday, and police said at least
86 people still were reported missing.
   At about 6 p.m., Mayor Lionel Wilson was telling reporters that
a search had found no survivors when police Lt. Kristina Wraa
interrupted to say one had been discovered.
   ``We have confirmed that there is one person alive, apparently
in a car underneath the top level,'' Wraa said, adding that rescue
workers had heard a voice and established physical contact with the
victim.
   That report was later dismissed as erroneous by Oakland police
Capt. Jim Hahn, who attributed it to a garbled communication
between officers.
   ``There were noises coming from the area. ... We have located
several individuals, none of whom are alive so there are no
survivors at this point,'' Hahn said.
   Gov. George Deumejian claimed the collapse of I-880 was the
result of substandard construction, although state transportation
officials said the freeway, one of the oldest in the area, had been
reinforced and was considered earthquake-safe. However, they said
further upgrading had been planned.
   Rescue workers searched for victims in the twisted metal and
concrete, and used a concrete saw to cut throug cement to each
automobile. Search dogs covered all but two sections of the
collapsed freeway and found no survivors, Wraa said.
   A helicopter brought in a remote-control backhoe late Wednesday
afternoon. Officials planned to shore up the freeway with steel and
wood piles to protect workers from a possible aftershock.
   The search was moving ``slowly and meticulously'' because the
collapsed highway was like ``a house of cards'' that could crash
down at any time, Kyle Nelson of the California Department of
Transportation said earlier.
   Shortly before dawn, a hook-and-ladder truck moved alongside the
flattened section of I-880. It stopped periodically to allow
firefighters to shine bright lights into gaps between the
northbound upper deck and the southbound lower deck.
   Screams and the crash of metal brought bystanders to the scene
on Tuesday.
   ``You could hear it crunching down _ but you couldn't see
anything. It was just a big white cloud,'' said witness Leroy
FitzGerald. ``You could hear people screaming for help.''
   When the 18-block stretch of highway caved in, workers from
businesses in the heavily industrial area ran to help, many
bringing tall ladders and forklifts.
   Rescuers were able to pull one man alive from a car that was
crushed to a height of 18 inches, said passer-by Patrick MacIntyre.
   Emergency workers pulled a girl from the wreckage of another
automobile. The fate of her parents and brother was unknown.
   A three-member surgical team had to amputate the right leg of a
7-year-old boy who was trapped in a car for seven hours. At 12:15
a.m., he finally was carried down a 20-foot ladder and taken to an
ambulance.
   There were many heroes.
   Darius Brewer, a 26-year-old cook, joined an impromptu rescue
party. The group crawled as far as possible under the crushed road
to help injured motorists. They used crowbars to pry open one car
and tied ropes around an elderly man to lower him 20 feet to safety.
   ``Then we went on top of the second deck and just mostly got
everybody down we could,'' he said. ``People were yelling and
screaming.''
   I-880 was built in 1957, and was reinforced in 1977 in the first
phase of a three-phase anti-earthquake program, Department of
Transportation officials said. In the work, the road deck was tied
to its supporting columns.
   The columns themselves collapsed, and the deck did not slip off
the columns, transportation department chief engineer Bill Schaefer
said in Sacramento.
   Further work to strengthen the road against earthquakes had been
deferred pending an engineering study, Schaefer said.
   Asked whether the freeway had been considered safe from
earthquakes, Schaefer said, ``there's no such thing as an
earthquake-proof structure,'' but added he was shocked by the
collapse.
   ``We thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake
we could have in this area, anything that would happen in this
area,'' he told reporters.
   Deukmejian called for an investigation of the collapse. ``I had
assumed that the freeways were ... constructed with adequate
standards so that they would be able to withstand a quake of this
severity,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Just in time for Halloween, the Oxford University
Press is publishing a ``Dictionary of Superstitions'' with 1,500
entries including stepping on cracks and knocking on wood.
   Moira Tatum said she and co-author Iona Opie found in seven
years of research that many of today's superstitions are universal
and harken back thousands of years beyond written history.
   ``Although we know it goes back 4,000 years to nature worship,
the earliest written reference to knocking on wood is a
19th-century children's game,'' Ms. Tatum said.
   ``But the actual knocking on wood, or `touch wood' as the
British say, to save oneself after saying a boastful thing,
originated in Germany where they always knocked the underside of a
table and said, `May I not be bewitched.'''
   Ms. Tatum said putting together 494 pages of superstitions cured
any fears she had of bad omens: ``After all that work, I am totally
converted from those pagan ways.''
   The superstition to avoid stepping on cracks dates back to the
ancient Greek mythological character Persephone who was taken to
the underworld by Hades, she said.
   Ms. Tatum said superstitions are especially common in tightly
knit communities.
   ``The small communities of seamen or miners in Ireland or
Scotland are full of superstitions,'' she said. ``That's where you
find the more obscure or arcane superstitions.''

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Tipped off by U.S. drug agents,
authorities raided a suburban home and seized more than 2,000
pounds of cocaine in Haiti's biggest drug haul of the year, a news
report said.
   Police carried out the raid in the northern suburb of Delmas on
Tuesday and discovered the drugs Wednesday. A Colombian and a
Venezuelan who rented the house were absent and not detained, Radio
Metropole said.
   Authorities seized 2,024 pounds of cocaine, the privately-owned
radio said. It gave no value for the drug.
   The station, quoting police, said Haitian authorities were
tipped off by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.
   Haiti has been identified by the DEA as a major conduit for
U.S.-bound Colombian cocaine. There has been testimony in a Cuban
drug-smuggling case linking ousted Haitian military leader Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy to drug-running.
   On Oct. 9, Defense and Interior Minister Brig. Gen. Acedius
Saint-Louis said drug seizures have increased by 200 percent this
year compared with 1988.
   He said the Haitian Narcotics Bureau had handed over 4,000
pounds of cocaine to the DEA for destruction.
   Namphy was ousted in September 1988 in a coup led by junior
officers who said they were disgusted by government corruption and
state-sponsored killings and put Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power.

cases you will see across the country in fraud on the government in
HUD programs,'' said U.S. Attorney Deborah Daniels.
   Named in separate indictments were Zionsville real estate agent
Joseph W. Cirillo and Indianapolis businessman Garry W. Newman, a
former HUD official.
   Daniels said Cirillo, 37, made false statements to help
applicants for low-income housing assistance obtain HUD-insured
mortgages for properties for which Cirillo was the broker.
   Once the loans were approved, Cirillo's company received profits
from the sale of the properties and brokerage fees, the indictment
said. In each of seven cases, the loans went into default, costing
the government about $200,000, Daniels said.
   If convicted, Cirillo could face up to 19 years in prison and a
fine of $2 million.
   Newman, 36, is charged with embezzling $54,425 from February
until April when his company, Closing Services Inc., acted as a
closing agent at the sale of HUD-repossessed properties.
   If convicted, Newman could face up to 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   A reporter's telephone calls to Cirillo's home were not answered
Wednesday and his business is no longer listed. The telephone at
Newman's office was disconnected and his home number is unlisted.
   The Justice Department and congressional committees began
investigating the federal housing agency after reports of
widespread fraud and mismanagement that is expected to cost the
government $6 billion.

   Space shuttle Atlantis soared into
orbit Wednesday and its astronauts started the Galileo probe on a
six-year, roundabout journey to Jupiter for the closest look yet at
the colossus of the solar system.
   ``Galileo is on its way to another world; it's in the hands of
the best flight controllers in this world,'' said Atlantis
commander Don Williams.
   Earlier, concerns about Galileo's nuclear power supply were left
behind as Atlantis lifted off flawlessly on its mission to carry
the $1.5 billion space probe into orbit on the first leg of its
trip.
   After Atlantis had made five trips around the world, Galileo was
ejected from the cargo bay by springs at 7:15 p.m. EDT, precisely
on schedule, over the Gulf of Mexico east of Brownsville, Tex. The
shuttle quickly moved away to put distance between itself and the
space probe's rocket.
   The ``burn'' was an hour later over Borneo _ first for 2{
minutes, then for a minute, 45 seconds _ giving the 6,700-pound
Galileo the initial push toward Venus, its first planetary
port-of-call.
   ``On time and on schedule,'' said Mission Control.
   ``It achieved earth-escape velocity and is now heading outbound
toward the sun,'' said Brian Welch, spokesman for Johnson Space
Center in Houston. A spacecraft can escape the Earth's gravity when
traveling faster than 25,000 mph.
   The five astronauts spent their first hours in space giving a
final electronic checkout to Galileo, a probe so sophisticated that
one NASA official dubbed it ``the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft.''
   ``Everything looks real good,'' said astronaut Shannon Lucid, a
one-flight veteran from Bethany, Okla., who had charge of the probe
deployment.
   The crew members reported a few problems with their own ship as
it orbited 184 miles above the Earth. One was with a cooling system
that might cause them to have to return slightly earlier than
planned in what a flight director called ``a worst-case scenario.''
   ``You looked marvelous going up,'' Mission Control told Williams
as the winged spacecraft reached orbit after two launch
postponements.
   ``I feel a lot better,'' said Williams.
   Galileo, named after the 17th century discoverer of Jupiter's
moons, will use the laws of physics to get to Jupiter, the largest
planet in the solar system, in 1995. Flying by Venus will cause it
to gain momentum and so will two subsequent close encounters with
Earth.
   Although concern over the Galileo's 49.4-pound plutonium power
supply was argued in court, it drew no protesters to the Kennedy
Space Center on launch day. Environmentalists had argued that a
Challenger-like accident could scatter deadly plutonium-238 over
Florida.
   Nothing like that happened Wednesday, and even the weather
cooperated. Clouds and rain threatened to halt the launch until the
last minutes of the countdown, but the clouds suddenly dissipated
and the shuttle darted into a bright blue sky, trailing a 700-foot
geyser of fire.
   The 132-ton Atlantis has a crew of five for the mission that
ends Monday with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California
at 2:38 p.m. EDT.
   The $1.5 billion mission already was seven years behind schedule
when Atlantis was grounded by rain at the last minute Tuesday and
by a faulty engine computer last week.
   ``It feels great,'' said NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk after
liftoff. ``It's been a long time.''
   Apart from Lucid, Williams' crew consists of pilot Mike McCulley
and mission specialists Ellen Baker and Franklin Chang-Diaz.
   The liftoff was the start of a voyage that will take the probe
on a looping path past Venus in February, back to within 620 miles
of Earth in December 1990 and past Earth again at a 200-mile
altitude two years later. The craft will arrive at Jupiter in
Deceber 1995 for a two-year orbit.
   As part of the mission, a robot will separate from the Galileo
spacecraft and plunge through Jupiter's gaseous atmosphere.
   Scientists hope to gain insight into the birth of the solar
system by studying Jupiter, which holds original material from that
event 14 billion years ago. The planet's diameter is about 11 times
that of Earth and its mass 318 times greater.
   The mission originally was to have started in 1982, but money
ran out. Then came the Challenger explosion in January 1986,
delaying all shuttle flights for three years and prompting a change
in the rocket to propel the Galileo.
   The mission originally was budgeted at $425 million. It will
climb to $1.9 billion by the time Galileo finishes a 10-orbit trip
around Jupiter in 1997.
   The sweeps past Earth and Venus will take advantage of the
planets' gravity to accelerate the spacecraft to the proper speed
to reach its distant target. Small onboard motors will fine-tune
the flight path.
   The Galileo's electricity will be generated by decaying
radioactive pellets of plutonium-238, which causes cancer and death
in humans if inhaled in minuscule amounts.
   Environmental activists feared not only a launch accident but
also mishaps during the two flybys. NASA convinced a federal judge
that the plutonium containers could withstand such pressures and
that even if there were a release of radioactivity there would be
no appreciable health effects.
   The government had hundreds of experts in the launch area _ just
in case _ to monitor any radioactive release.
   More than 200 guards on foot, in helicopters and boats patrolled
the launch center for protesters who said they might try to stop
the launch by infiltrating the launch zone and sitting on the
launch pad.
   ``We've succeeded in a small way calling attention to the
escalating plan to put nuclear energy into space, including in Star
Wars,'' said Bruce Gagnon of the Florida Coalition for Peace and
Justice.
   ``The real fundamental point is that people haven't been doing
much more than ooo-ing and ahhh-ing at the launches. They haven't
been considering the moral and ethical issues of what is in these
things, where they are going and what they are doing.''

   A 100-year-old man sliced into the
world's biggest cake to mark this town's 100th anniversary.
   The 128,238-pound, 12-layer cake _ 32 feet wide, 80 feet long
and shaped like the state of Alabama _ was unveiled Wednesday at
the local fairgrounds before 6,000 people. The country band
Alabama, who hail from Fort Payne, sang ``Happy Birthday.''
   Ed Henderson cut the cake with a sword and helped serve pieces.
   Gary Gengozian, editor and publisher of the local newspaper, The
Times Journal, came up with the idea of baking the birthday cake
because the EarthGrains Inc. bakery is the town's largest employer,
with 750 workers.
   He set a goal of topping a 90,000-pound cake baked in Austin,
Texas, for the Texas Sesquicentennial in 1986. The Guinness Book of
World Records lists that cake as the heaviest ever made.
   Guinness approved construction plans for the Fort Payne cake but
still must verify it as a record.
   Gary Gilbert, who supervised the baking of cake by EarthGrains,
said it contained 33,238 pounds of cake flour, 21,980 pounds of
sugar, 11,799 pounds of corn syrup, 608 pounds of vegetable oil,
161 pounds of vanilla flavoring, 1,206 pounds of baking powder, 568
gallons of powdered milk, 19,250 pounds of water and 429 pounds of
salt.
   The icing added another 33,354 pounds of ingredients, mostly
sugar.
   A local metal company provided the steel supports to keep the
cake from collapsing under its own weight.
   The Chamber of Commerce in the town of 12,000 said the cake
required $25,000 in ingredients, paid for with donations.

   After 35 years, Jesse McCormick still
gets teased about being replaced by a dog in Norman Rockwell's
famous picture ``Breaking Home Ties.''
   ``I've been razzed about this quite a bit,'' said Mrs.
McCormick, 84. ``I knew that he changed the faces of the people in
his portraits, but this was a little drastic.''
   According to a Rockwell exhibit at the Old Corner House, the
artist had initially envisioned both a grieving mother and a father
in his 1954 painting of a young boy leaving home for the first
time. But only the father and son made the final version.
   Mrs. McCormick said was delighted when her late husband, Joseph,
a groundskeeper at the Stockbridge Country Club, came home and told
her that the artist wanted both of them to sit for the painting.
   ``I was so excited,'' Mrs. McCormick recalled. ``I made a dress
for the picture. I told everybody we were going to be on the cover
of the magazine.''
   The couple sat for several photos in Rockwell's studio with the
artist himself playing the anxious son.
   But when Rockwell finally got around to painting, he replaced
Mrs. McCormick with a big collie.
   She said one of her friends attempted to console her with the
advice, ``Don't feel so badly, dear. It's a beautiful dog.''

   When the San Francisco Bay area was slammed
this week by a catastrophic earthquake, Elsie Keating was one of
the few who remembered one even more terrible.
   ``This was a really heavy one ... (but) 1906 was the worst
one,'' the 91-year-old woman said Wednesday from her daughter's
house in suburban Concord, where she was recovering from injuries
suffered in Tuesday's quake.
   ``The city was in flames. We were all sitting on the sidewalk.
... There was no water, no medical care. We are all advised to go
to higher ground. I was 7. You didn't know where to run.''
   The memory of a stronger jolt didn't make Tuesday any less
terrifying, Mrs. Keating said.
   ``I was sitting in a rocking chair. It started to swing and
sway. Finally it gave a big jolt ... like a ship on the sea,'' she
said.
   She fell from the chair, hurting her wrist, fingers, knee and
leg. Her screams alerted the manager of the senior citizen's
apartment complex, who helped carry her to her bed. She spent the
night without electricity in a dark, frightening city.
   ``It was horrifying,'' she said. ``Every two hours, an
aftershock. A fear, a terrible feeling, to think everything will be
destroyed.''
   On Wednesday morning, her daughter, Jeanette Williams, and Mrs.
Williams' husband took her into their home, 30 miles northeast of
San Francisco, to recover.
   The daughter of immigrants from Austria and Hungary, she was 1
when her family moved from New York's Long Island to San Francisco.
Her father, who spoke little English, did maintenance work in
theaters here.
   Six years after her family arrived, the mightiest earthquake in
U.S. history struck. The 1906 quake, estimated at 8.3 on the
open-ended Richter scale, was followed by an even more destructive
fire. The temblor was more than 10 times as powerful as Tuesday's
quake, which registered 6.9.
   ``The buildings sunk into the ground,'' Mrs. Keating recalled.
``My mother and I were walking around, going to Twin Peaks with a
blanket,'' she said of the scenic area.
   Her father went down into the fire area with another relative to
clean and stack bricks, she said.
   Their Mission District house was the only one on the block to
survive, but they had to seek higher ground to escape the smoke,
she said. They moved to another neighborhood, and she has remained
in San Francisco all her life, working at times as a typist and
taking part in dog shows. She also has attended some of the annual
commemorations of the April 18, 1906, quake.
   Like most Californians, she lives near active fault lines in the
earth and has gotten used to periodic earthquakes. But when
Tuesday's quake began, she said, ``I said to myself, `This has gone
too far.'''

   Need to pick up some helicopters, light
armored vehicles and tank ammunition for your country's defense?
The easy answer is one-stop shopping _ military style _ with the
Association of the United States Army.
   With the blessing of the Defense Department, the association is
holding its annual meeting this week featuring the customary
big-name speakers such as former Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci and information panels on topics like Soviet forces and
national security.
   The main attraction, however, is the approximately 200 defense
industry and Army exhibits on every imaginable aspect of weaponry.
   ``The exhibits ... reflect the latest in military doctrine,
technological advances and hardware improvements,'' says the
association, which has held what it touts as ``the largest
landpower forum in the free world'' for the past 35 years.
   Among the items on exhibit in the bowels of a Washington hotel
were a full-scale light armored vehicle, a handful of howitzers and
several high-tech videos promoting helicopters, M-16 machine guns
and night-vision goggles.
   Beribboned officers, fresh-faced cadets and defense industry
officials created traffic jams as they grabbed glossy brochures,
closely examined the rifles and handguns and questioned the
hundreds of company representatives.
   Some sat transfixed as they watched a sophisticated video on the
LHX helicopter displayed on 16 television monitors. It was a
combination of James Bond and Top Gun.
   ``Time to smell the coffee, sucker,'' said the helicopter pilot
as he maneuvered his aircraft through mountain ranges and green
valleys and located his target with the help of a British-sounding
female voice.
   ``Have a nice walk home, Ivan,'' the pilot said after a
successful hit.
   But beyond all the glitz, there was serious business as
officials from General Motors, McDonnell Douglas, General Electric,
ITT Defense and John Deere briefed representatives from foreign
countries and the United States on their latest wares.
   For the buyer who can't afford to fly from one company to the
next, the meeting provides a ``great place for networking in a
marketing environment,'' said Joe O'Brien, an official with General
Motors, as he stood in front of the company's 14 1@2-ton light
armored vehicle equipped with a 25mm gun.
   The meeting, according to O'Brien, is strictly for the buyer who
wants to browse.
   ``No contracts. We don't even talk about contracts. If we did
the defense secretary could not endorse it,'' he said. ``Those
types of things are verboten.''
   Instead, the companies tout the advantages and successes of
their products with the hope that a telephone call or meeting at a
later date will result in a sale.
   General Motors' light armored vehicle is ideal for low-intensity
conflicts and in fact, 14 of them were flown into Panama when the
rebel forces led a failed coup against leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega, according to the General Motors official.
   The vehicle has ``great acceleration, a low silhouette, when
it's smaller it's harder to hit, great mobility,'' O'Brien said.
   Like in a car showroom where prospective buyers kick the tires,
people have come up and knocked their knuckles on the vehicle and
said, ``Oh boy, this is it,'' he said.
   On the other side of the room, in front of a large video screen,
representatives of Bell Helicopter Textron praised the V-22 Osprey,
the aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but flies like a
plane.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in his budget for the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1, proposed killing the program. The move was met
with opposition on Capitol Hill where the Marine Corps aircraft
enjoys a great deal of popularity.
   House and Senate conferees hammering out a final defense bill
have not yet reached a decision on the aircraft. But Dick Spivey of
Bell Helicopter Textron is convinced the Osprey is key to the
nation's defense.
   ``Noriega may be here in jail now if we had the V-22,'' the
company official said.

   Elisabeth Welch's first song, ``One Life To
Life,'' contained the line ``If I'm in town, I want to be the toast
of it.''
   On Wednesday and Thursday she can claim to be the toast of New
York, where she has come from London to sing the first two nights
of ``Cabaret Comes to Carnegie'' in Weill Recital Hall.
   Miss Welch's biography doesn't include her age but it says that
she made her Broadway debut in 1923, in ``Runnin' Wild.'' The sweet
but distinctive timbre of her voice isn't a great deal different
from her vintage recordings and she sings with remarkable control.
   But a long time lived infused at least two songs with a special
glow. They were Jerry Herman's ``Song on the Sand,'' a mellow
looking back at falling in love, and Noel Coward's ``I'll Follow My
Secret Heart,'' sung in a soft, reminiscent mode.
   Miss Welch recounted how, in 1930, she was singing in cabaret
here when three friends of Cole Porter came to hear her sing ``Love
for Sale.'' They recommended that she sing it in the Broadway show
``The New Yorkers,'' which she did. Later, when she was singing in
cabaret in Paris, Porter sent for her and said he had a song for
her in a new London show to star Gertrude Lawrence. ``Let's face
it, who stays in Paris?'', Miss Welch asked.
   She sang Porter's ``Solomon'' in ``Nymph Errant'' in London in
1933 and sang it at Weill Recital Hall on Wednesday. Her voice
wavered on the title word, which is held long, and on the exposed
long lines of ``September Song'' her voice wavered again, somehow
in an endearing way.
   The singer made the cabaret staple ``Miss Otis Regrets''
unusually amusing. She said of Helen Morgan, ``Songs seemed to come
from her inner depths. She had a great sadness about her.'' She
sang a Jerome Kern specialty of Miss Morgan's, ``Why Was I Born?'',
and made it strong but not very sad.
   A trio, Peter Howard, Bruce Samuels and Michael Keller,
accompanied Miss Welch. Toward the end of her more than an hour
show, they were swinging. On those songs Miss Welch danced a bit as
she sang, including on her encore, ``Bye, Bye, Blackbird.''
   Her appearance here coincides with the release of an RCA album,
``This Thing Called Love,'' and her Weill Recital Hall evenings are
being taped for a follow-up, live album.

   Actress Audrey Hepburn observed life in
Bangkok's largest slum on a mission to publicize the plight of the
hungry, downtrodden children of the world.
   Hepburn, representing the U.N. Children's Fund, also met
Wednesday with Prateep Hata, known as the ``Slum Angel of Bangkok.''
   ``I am full of admiration for this marvelous angel as she is
called. I've seen many of these people. They are the ones that make
a big, big difference,'' Hepburn said.
   The star of ``My Fair Lady,'' ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' and
``Roman Holiday'' said she hoped to make some difference in the
lives of the world's downtrodden when she left her Swiss villa and
became a UNICEF fund-raiser and goodwill ambassador two years ago.
   ``I put off growing tomatoes for a while,'' she said.
   Prateep, a slum child herself, started a foundation to care for
and educate neglected children. The foundation's seed money was the
$20,000 grant Prateep got with the 1978 Magsaysay Award, the
equivalent of the Nobel Peace Prize in Asia.
   Prateep had begun a kindergarten when she was 16 years old to
care for the children she saw abandoned in the streets.
   ``She is proof that where there is determination and love there
is a way,'' said Hepburn, 60.
   Hepburn said she has little time for acting. In August, however,
she flew to Montana to spend two weeks filming a part in Steven
Spielberg's ``Always,'' which stars Richard Dreyfus and Holly
Hunter. The movie is scheduled for December release.

   Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin pleaded
guilty to urinating in the galley of an airborne jet and agreed to
pay $1,000 cleanup costs.
   Stradlin, 27, said he urinated outside the restroom of the USAir
flight on Aug. 27 because he was frustrated at being kept waiting
outside.
   Originally he was charged with interfering with the duty of a
flight crew, a felony, but the charge was dropped Tuesday when
Stradlin pled guilty to four misdemeanor charges.
   He was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine, $1,000 toward cleanup costs
and write a letter of apology to the USAir crew.
   U.S. Magistrate Michael Mignella also placed Stradlin on six
months' probation, which includes counseling.
   Stradlin, whose real name is Jeffrey Dean Isbell, was arrested
at Sky Harbor International Airport during a scheduled stop in
Phoenix of an Indianapolis-Los Angeles flight. He spent one night
in jail.

   More than 750 radio stations will carry the Nov. 19 broadcast,
``Country Cares for St. Jude Kids,'' to raise money for St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital.
   Other performers include Glen Campbell, Crystal Gayle, Lee
Greenwood, Highway 101, Emmylou Harris, the Judds, Barbara
Mandrell, Kathy Mattea, Reba McEntire, the Oak Ridge Boys, Buck
Owens, Kenny Rogers, Randy Travis, Conway Twitty and Ricky Van
Shelton.
   Owen organized the show; the performances will be taped rather
than live.
   The hospital, which opened 27 years ago, specializes in leukemia
treatment.

   First lady Barbara Bush, General Motors head
Roger Smith and Soviet author Chingiz Aitmatov were honored by a
foundation that promotes religious freedom throughout the world.
   ``Who would have thought, even two years ago, that we would be
gathering honoring the first lady of the United States, the
chairman of the largest corporation in the world and honoring a
Soviet author,'' said Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the
Appeal of Conscience Foundation.
   The three each were presented Steuben crystal stars at a press
conference Wednesday night.
   Schneier said Mrs. Bush was being honored as a ``woman of
faith'' and ``for her own leadership in and commitment to improving
the quality of life in the American family.''
   Asked whether she thought it symbolic that she and Smith were
being honored along with a Soviet author, Mrs. Bush said: ``It's
just another sign of the friendship between our two countries.''
   In honoring Smith for his philanthropic contributions, Schneier
said: ``There is a perception that a successful corporation head
has no soul and no sensitivity. That's not Roger Smith.''
   Aitmatov was honored ``as a writer who has probed deeply into
the soul of the Russian people and mankind's struggle for human
dignity.''

   French designer Claude Montana will be Lanvin's new
creator of haute couture, the fashion house announced.
   Montana is the latest ready-to-wear designer to join the world
of couture after several other shakeups in the heady high fashion
scene this past year.
   Montana _ the creator of hulking, linebacker shoulders and
strong, aggressive fashion _ will be expected to turn out the
refined clothes expected by customers of the venerable old house of
Lanvin, started by Jeanne Lanvin in the 1920s.
   ``I'll be showing my first collection for 1990 next January,''
Montana said at a news conference Wednesday.
   He ducked questions about his salary. The Paris-born Montana
went to London when he was 20, and nearly starved before he created
papier-mache jewelry that was noticed by Vogue magazine.
   He returned to Paris and designed for several leather companies
before turning out his own collections starting in 1977.

   A drug that improves the success of kidney
transplants also helps reduce medical bills by shortening the
length of hospital stays, according to a study published today.
   Among patients receiving new kidneys, hospital bills totaled an
average of $28,649 for those receiving the anti-rejection drug
cyclosporine and $37,895 for those who did not, a 24 percent
difference, according to the study.
   Patients receiving the drug were discharged from the hospital in
three weeks rather than five, according to research directed by
Jonathan Showstack at the University of California, San Francisco.
   The drug keeps the body from rejecting the foreign organ. The
study said the medicine improved the chances of a successful kidney
transplant from 60 percent to 80 percent.
   The research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
was based on studies of 702 patients who received transplants
between 1982 and 1986, the period during which cyclosporine became
widely available.
   Doctors from the University of Pittsburgh, meanwhile, said
Wednesday a new drug code named FK-506 appears to be even more
effective and less toxic than cyclosporine. Dr. Thomas E. Starzl,
who pioneered the use of cyclosporine, said the new drug could make
transplants cheaper still by speeding recovery and reducing the
need for tests.
   In a separate report in the journal, Dr. Catherine C. Cowie of
Social &amp; Scientific Systems in Bethesda, Md., directed a study
showing that black people with diabetes are more likely than whites
with the disease to suffer kidney failure.
   Diabetes is the underlying cause of about one-quarter of all
cases of kidney failure in the United States, and blacks are about
three times more likely than whites to have diabetic kidney
failure. However, it was unclear whether this was simply because
blacks are more likely to get diabetes.
   The new study, based on 470 blacks and 861 whites in Michigan,
found that the incidence of diabetic kidney failure was 2.6 times
higher among blacks, even when their higher prevalence of diabetes
was taken into account.
   An accompanying editorial by Dr. Stephen G. Rostand of the
University of Alabama said the increased risk may result in part
from racial differences in kidney function. However, better control
of blood sugar and blood pressure could improve blacks' chances of
escaping kidney failure.

<HEAD>Panel Finds Bates Sexually Harassed Workers</HEAD>

   The House ethics committee says Rep. Jim
Bates, D-Calif., could face House disciplinary action if he repeats
harassment of female staffers or permits any more campaign
activities in his office.
   Bates was informed by the committee Wednesday that he violated a
House rule prohibiting sexual harassment and an ethics guideline
barring campaign work in a congressional office.
   ``Your improper conduct and concurrent violations of relevant
standards deserve reproval,'' the four-term San Diego Democrat was
told in a letter from Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif.
and ranking Republican John T. Myers of Indiana.
   The panel declined to recommend disciplinary action by the full
House, which could range from a reprimand to expulsion in the most
extreme cases.
   But the committee warned Bates that ``any further violation by
you in the areas which were the subject of the ... inquiry may
result in a recommendation that disciplinary action be considered
by the House.''
   The panel began a preliminary inquiry against Bates after a
complaint last October by two women who had worked in his
congressional office.
   The women, who had left Bates' office before filing their
complaint, said he sexually harassed them while they were employees
and pressured congressional staffers to do campaign work.
   The committee acknowledged Bates has apologized to ``anyone who
may have been offended'' by his personal conduct, but deemed that
action insufficient.
   Bates was directed to write the women, Karen Dryden and Dorena
Bertussi ``apologizing for behavior which was sexual harassment,
copies of which should be provided to this committee.''
   Bates told reporters he allowed a campaign employee to make
fund-raising calls from his office and later hired the worker for
the congressional staff.
   Bates told reporters,
   ``I accept the committee's judgment,'' he said, adding, ``Times
are changing. Members of Congress are going to be scrutinized for
their personal and professional behavior.
   ``Sexual harassment is very serious and not to be taken lightly.
I did not know what sexual harassment meant until this came up.''
   The rule cited by the committee states: ``A member, officer or
employee of the House of Representatives shall not discharge or
refuse to hire any individual, or otherwise discriminate against
any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions or
privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color,
religion, sex or national origin.''
   The ethics committee's manual for members states, ``Official
allowances may not be used to defray any personal, political, or
campaign-related expenses.''

<HEAD>Trade Agreement With Canada Will Help Vegetable Sales, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new long-range trade pact with Canada
should help boost consumer demand for fresh vegetables on both
sides of the border, perhaps by 25 percent overall, says
Agriculture Department economist Amy Sparks.
   The U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which took effect last
Jan. 1, removes many trade restrictions between the two countries.
A major benefit down the road will be the elimination of all
agricultural tariffs within 10 years.
   Sparks, who works for the department's Economic Research
Service, took a look at the trade agreement's impact on vegetables.
Her findings are reported in a forthcoming issue of Farmline
magazine.
   Why focus on vegetables, when there are other larger and more
glamorous export commodities such as grains and meat to study?
   ``Everybody asks that question,'' Sparks said Wednesday in a
telephone interview. ``Don't feel that I take it personally.''
   But something ``totally different'' had to be found for her
doctoral dissertation, and vegetables were it, she said.
   ``Also, international trade in vegetables is growing quite a
bit,'' Sparks said. ``While it's not one of our major crops like
soybeans or corn, it's growing in importance and is something that
needs to be looked at.''
   The United States and Canada are each other's largest export
markets, overall, the report said. More than 18 percent of last
year's total U.S. imports were from Canada, while almost 22 percent
of all U.S. exports went to Canada.
   But agriculture makes up only a small portion of U.S. trade with
Canada, the report said. And of the U.S. agricultural export total,
only about 5 percent went to Canada in the 1980s.
   According to the department's Foreign Agricultural Service,
Canada imports around $3 billion in U.S. agricultural products
annually, including an average of about $450 million worth of
vegetables and $650 million worth of fruit.
   The USDA forecasts 1989-90 agricultural exports to Canada at a
value of $2.2 billion but adds that in recent years these figures
``have been under-reported by an estimated $1 billion annually''
and is officially recognized by both governments.
   Agricultural imports from Canada in 1989-90 are forecast at
about $2.8 billion, according to current USDA figures.
   The department's official estimate of total U.S. agricultural
export value in the year that began Oct. 1 is $40 billion. Japan is
the biggest single-country market at $8.1 billion, followed by the
Soviet Union, $3.5 billion; South Korea, $2.5 billion; Mexico, $2.4
billion; and Canada, $2.2 billion.
   With the complete elimination of tariffs, U.S. demand for
Canadian vegetables would increase about 80 percent from today's
levels, and Canadian demand for U.S. vegetable would go up 30
percent, according to Sparks' study.

   The share of commodity marketings by farm
cooperatives has declined from levels of the early 1980s, according
to an Agriculture Department report.
   In 1987, the most recent year examined, co-ops accounted for 25
percent of farm marketings, down from 27 percent in 1985 and 28
percent in 1982.
   Grain marketings by cooperatives were reported at 29 percent of
the total, down from 33 percent in 1985 and 36 percent in 1982.
That includes sales of oilseeds except for cottonseed.
   ``Much of the decline has been the result of less cooperative
involvement in grain and oilseeds marketing,'' the report by the
department's Agricultural Cooperative Service said Wednesday.
   The co-op share of milk marketed was 76 percent in 1987,
compared with 78 percent in 1985 and 77 percent in 1982. Cotton
marketings were 38 percent, 33 percent and 36 percent,
respectively, and livestock at 7 percent, 8 percent and 11 percent.
   Fruit and vegetable marketings by co-ops accounted for 23
percent of the total in 1987, up from 8 percent in 1985 and 11
percent in 1982.
   Cooperative shares of production supplies sold to farmers also
dropped by similar percentages, to 25 percent in 1987 from 27
percent in 1985 and 28 percent in 1982, the report said. However,
not all items declined accordingly.
   Supplies included: fertilizer, 43 percent of the total in 1987,
44 percent in 1985 and 42 percent in 1982; petroleum, 37 percent,
44 percent and 36 percent; farm chemicals, 28 percent; 29 percent
and 34 percent; seed, 19 percent, 15 percent and 17 percent; and
feed, 17 percent, 16 percent and 18 percent.

   An Agriculture Department trade report says
U.S. exports of solid wood products were valued at $2.95 billion in
the first six months of this year, up 11 percent from the first
half of 1988.
   Softwood products rose 4 percent to $1.9 billion, the report by
the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said Wednesday. That
included about $1.09 billion in the value of logs, $648.1 million
for lumber, and $104.9 million for plywood.
   Hardwood products increased 29 percent to $661 million,
including a 62 percent jump in hardwood logs to $147.8 million.
   ``Exports to Japan, the leading purchaser of U.S. wood products,
increased by 25 percent in the first half to $1.4 billion,'' the
report said. ``The other growth markets include Canada, 11 percent;
Iraq, 140 percent; and Australia, 39 percent.''
   But exports to China and Belgium, two other top markets, were
down 38 percent and 50 percent, respectively, from a year earlier,
the report said.

   The powerful earthquake that jolted the San
Francisco Bay area forced a holiday on tens of thousands of people,
who poured into the rubble-littered streets to gawk at nature's
might.
   Amid the balmy weather that encouraged throngs clad mostly in
shorts and T-shirts, there were scenes of devastation and others _
like the soup line of 1,000 outside Glide Memorial Church in the
seedy Tenderloin district _ emblematic of more permanent
misfortunes.
   The disaster brought out the spectator in many, but others
pitched in to help the homeless and distraught.
   ``This is an incredible coming together; an act of the brotherly
love that San Franciscans were famous for in the '60s,''
self-described ``ex-hippie'' Chuck Rosen said as he helped people
clear rubble from a collapsed building.
   The dawn of a flaming sun, colored through wisps of fog in the
hills east of San Francisco, painted streets in rose tones as
residents and hundreds of stranded visitors awoke a day after the
quake, unsure of what awaited them.
   Thousands arose from a night in emergency shelters, hundreds
more from makeshift tents in city parks and rural lots. Most had
spent more than 12 hours without heat or light.
   But the vast majority of the region's 6 million residents made
it through the night in largely undisturbed comfort. As they
mingled on the streets by the hundreds in cities ranging from the
Pacific coastal community of Santa Cruz to Oakland, they became a
portrait of contrasts.
   In San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, joggers huffed in the
bright high-noon sun. Temperatures reached the high 70s by late
afternoon. A couple walked their two dogs. A lone man sunbathed on
a knoll near the towering band shell.
   While sprinklers in the well-to-do Marina district saturated
expansive, manicured lawns, many residents of collapsed sections of
the neighborhood were forced into a Red Cross shelter, where they
quickly ran out of water. A Mendocino water company donated a
truckload of bottled water.
   The traditional daily crowd of tattered homeless people at
Tenderloin churches was swelled by hundreds of elderly hotel
dwellers and Southeast Asian refugee families. They came to the
church hoping to eat their first meal since the quake.
   The Marina, at the northern end of the city inside the Golden
Gate, is renowned for its narrow, curving streets, with such names
as Alhambra, Cervantes and Mallorca. The streets are lined with
neat, handsome homes and apartments, most finished with
light-colored stucco and many with tile roofs.
   But the area, built on fill land, was the hardest hit of San
Francisco's neighborhoods.
   On Wednesday, it contained scenes like this: Next to the
crumpled, charred rubble of a three-story apartment complex, an
elderly woman gingerly dusted a delicate crystal lamp.
   A helicopter tour of the Bay Area beginning at daybreak revealed
billowing smoke pouring from a block of the Marina nearly flattened
by a fire that broke out after the quake. Two joggers ran by,
trying to step over firehoses without breaking stride.
   The grand sandstone structure of the Palace of Fine Arts, built
for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, was draped in
smoke from the devastated buildings two blocks away. The
neighborhood of bungalows and Victorians looked as if a giant
invading creature had taken two steps and then turned back.
   The silver strand of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
gracefully cut through the foggy haze, marred only by lines of
orange hazard cones blocking traffic.
   A collapsed 50-foot section of the upper level looked like
nothing more than one pasteboard in a fallen house of cards. On
either side of the bridge, the green-and-yellow pennants of the
Oakland Athletics and the black-and-orange of the San Francisco
Giants flapped at each other in the light morning breeze, with no
motorists to cheer them on.
   On the Oakland side of the bridge, a collapsed section of
Interstate 880 looked like it had melted in a scorching sun. On the
nearby beaches of Alameda, scores of sun bathers took advantage of
canceled school or work.
   At Santa Cruz, the historic Boardwalk amusement park was
spotless but without visitors, while hundreds of people stood in
block-long lines at the few supermarkets open to the public in a
city largely devoid of power and potable water.

<HEAD>North Supporters Fighting to Restore His Pension</HEAD>

   Some lawmakers are vowing to restore Oliver
North's $23,000 military retirement pay, saying Congress never
intended for its anti-shredding law to deprive the convicted
Iran-Contra figure his pension.
   ``Regardless of what happened in the Iran-Contra affair, people
have a difficult time understanding why he is being denied the
pension that he earned,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   The Senate is scheduled to vote Nov. 3 on a bill that would
exempt North from the penalty which was imposed after he was
convicted July 5 on charges of shredding government documents and
two other felonies. North is appealing the convictions.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said
he will draft a report for the full Senate that outlines the
arguments on both sides of the politically divisive issue.
   ``We've got to solve this thing. We've got to make this thing
square for everybody,'' Biden told reporters after a hearing on
Wednesday on the matter.
   Biden suggested lawmakers should deal not just with North's
case, but with the pension rights of any federal official _
including members of Congress _ convicted of a felony.
   North's retirement pay was $23,000 a year. He is reportedly
getting $25,000 for each speech he gets on the lecture circuit.
   The law under which the pay was revoked provides that anyone
convicted of shredding protected government documents ``shall
forfeit his office.''
   The General Accounting Office, which has jurisdiction over
federal pay matters, ruled North's status as a retired military
officer came under that provision of the law and that forfeiting
his office meant he no longer qualified for retirement pay.
   Some conservatives who view North as a hero who bore the brunt
of blame for the Iran-Contra scandal were outraged at the decision.
Hatch, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., have said the retirement pay should be restored.
   But Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said North's sentence was
too lenient and the GAO was right to deny him retirement pay. ``We
are sending the wrong message when people violate the public trust
and get off with only a slap on the wrist,'' he said.
   Legal scholars told the Judiciary panel Congress should answer
whether the law meant for ``office'' to include military positions.
Technically, military retirement pay is not a pension based on past
service but a reduced salary for an officer who continues to hold a
commission and remains subject to recall to active duty.
   North ``very well may be entitled to his pension,'' Biden said.
``Whatever we do, there should be a basic equity'' with other cases.
   But he acknowledged, ``It's not going to be divorced from
politics.''

<HEAD>Pair Sentenced to Jail in Alaska's Longest, Costliest Criminal Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men convicted in Alaska's longest
and costliest criminal trial for a conspiracy to wring millions
from a billion-dollar Arctic construction binge have been sentenced
to seven years in prison.
   Lobbyist Lewis Dischner and businessman Carl Mathisen also will
forfeit more than $11 million as a result of their convictions
earlier this year on extortion, racketeering and fraud charges.
   The advisers to former North Slope Borough Mayor Eugene Brower
pocketed millions in kickbacks and sent construction contracts to
companies they secretly owned, prosecutors said. The construction
program was aimed at providing 20th century comforts for the
nation's northernmost communities.
   ``Any mistakes I've made, I'm really sorry,'' Dischner said
Wednesday before he was sentenced. ``I hope I haven't hurt
anybody.''
   Mathisen stopped short of apologizing, saying, ``If they (the
jury) were right and I was wrong, then I'm truly sorry.''
   Former Alaska U.S. Attorney Mike Spaan urged U.S. District Judge
James Fitzgerald to sentence each defendant to 15 years in prison.
He said the stiff sentence might deter other would-be white-collar
criminals.
   Spaan said he was pleased with the sentences, adding, ``I think
the judge tempered the sentence with mercy.''
   Dischner's lawyer, Douglas Pope, had asked that his 71-year-old
client receive a three-year sentence, to be served at a
minimum-security prison.
   ``A 15-year sentence, as we all know, and we should not kid
ourselves, is a death sentence for Lewis Dischner,'' he said.
   Laurence Finegold, Mathisen's lawyer, asked that his client
receive probation because of his poor health, or that he serve his
term at his home.
   But Fitzgerald said he considered Dischner's age and Mathisen's
medical condition, which includes a heart ailment and ulcers, when
fashioning their sentences. He recommended that the two serve their
terms in a minimum-security prison.
   He said he did not order restitution because it would have cost
the government too much and taken too long to determine how much
the two owed the borough. The judge said the borough could pursue
payment through the courts.
   Dischner, a Democratic activist and labor commissioner in former
Gov. Bill Egan's administration, was convicted May 22 on 21 counts,
including racketeering, extortion, and wire and mail fraud. The
jury acquitted him on four income tax counts.
   Mathisen, 56, a businessman with close ties to the North Slope
dating back to the early 1970s, was convicted on 22 counts.
   Dischner and Mathisen each received seven years on a pair of
racketeering and racketeering conspiracy counts, and five years
each on the other counts. Fitzgerald ordered all terms to run
concurrently.
   The federal racketeering statute under which the two were
convicted allows the government to seek forfeiture of money and
property obtained illegally. That would require a second trial, but
the two waived their right to another day in court.
   Dischner agreed to forfeit $5.8 million; Mathisen $5.7 million.
   Prosecutors said Dischner and Mathisen used lavish gifts to
manipulate Brower, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion in exchange
for his testimony. Brower was sentenced to 30 days in jail and
fined $5,000.
   Prosecutors said payments to Dischner and Mathisen added $73
million to the Minnesota-sized borough's billion-dollar building
boom. They said the two men pocketed $21 million while Brower was
mayor from 1981 to 1984.

<HEAD>US Accused of Violating Law With Indirect Support of Khmer Rouge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the Federation of American
Scientists says the Bush administration is violating the law by
providing military supplies and advisers to allies of the Khmer
Rouge.
   Jeremy Stone, at a news conference Wednesday, said the Khmer
Rouge is still run by Pol Pot, who killed 2 million Cambodians when
he controlled the country from 1975 until 1978. ``These people are
beyond the Nazis,'' he said.
   Stone, who met last month with Thai leaders, said Thailand may
be prepared to reduce its support to the Khmer Rouge and Indonesia
and Malaysia, two other members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, ``are not in favor of the old line'' against
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   ``We should support Hun Sen as the main bulwark against the
Khmer Rouge,'' Stone said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, at a peace conference in
August in Paris, supported an interim role for the Khmer Rouge in
the transition to a new government in Cambodia. But the conference
collapsed, and Stone warned the fighting is likely to increase with
the onset of the dry season.
   ``We think that the Department of State has to confront the
Chinese government publicly over its support of the Khmer Rouge,''
Stone said. ``We fear President Bush is taking his interest in
maintaining good relations with the Chinese too seriously. The
Chinese are oppressing democracy in China.''
   Stone said Vietnamese troops that backed Hun Sen have left
Cambodia and the Soviets will cease their support of the government
if the United States and China stopped assisting a three-way
coalition of troops loyal to Prince Sihanouk, the Khmer Rouge and
Son Senn.
   Stone said ASEAN still formally supports a hard line against Hun
Sen because it prefers unanimity on foreign policy issues.
   ``But,'' he said, ``the front-line state of Thailand has invited
Hu Senn to Bangkok three times and met with him in friendly fashion
and exchanged friendly messages. The Indonesian and Malaysian
governments are not in favor of the old line of freezing out the
Hun Sen government. The unanimity of ASEAN on this issue is no
longer real and it is something the U.S. government has to
recognize.''
   Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan is due to visit
Washington Nov. 14-16 for talks with Bush and Baker.
   Stone said the Bush administration violated the Foreign Aid
authorization bill by providing military advisers, uniforms and
other supplies to Sihanouk forces and by helping Son Senn in his
forays into Cambodia.
   ``The U.S. government is supporting the Khmer Rouge in violation
of the law,'' he said. ``We say we are not supporting the Khmer
Rouge. We say we are only supporting Sihanouk and Son Senn. But
they are in a coalition with the Khmer Rouge. To support part of a
coalition with the Khmer Rouge is to support the Khmer Rouge.''

   The Bay area quake smashed a rare jade
pagoda into hundreds of pieces and damaged early California
exhibits and other artifacts at the Oakland Museum, a spokesman
said.
   The early 20th Century pagoda, about 4 feet tall, fell over in
its case and splintered, spokesman Phil Mumma said.
   ``The piece has a large value because it's so rare and very
unusual,'' Mumma said, adding, ``a lot of the pieces even if they
have a dollar value cannot be replaced by money.''
   Still, he said, damage in Tuesday's quake was moderate
considering the museum's location _ about a mile east of the Nimitz
Freeway section that collapsed, crushing to death more than 250
people.
   ``We are very, very fortunate,'' he said. ``Some sculptures
turned over with minimal damage, some glass pieces and some ceramic
pieces were either damaged or completely destroyed.''
   The museum was closed Wednesday for damage assessment.

   Monkeys and peacocks at the San Francisco
Zoological Gardens screamed, and elephants trumpeted when the
earthquake hit.
   Mike Sulak, curator of mammals, said he didn't notice any
unusual behavior among the animals in the minutes before Tuesday
evening's earthquake.
   But when the ground shook, the entire zoo erupted into a
cacophony of animal alarms that only died down after an hour or so,
Sulak said Wednesday.
   Kubie, an elder male gorilla, became extremely agitated and
would not go inside his shelter to join his mate and baby as
normal. He grunted and called out all night.
   Keepers finally lured Kubie inside Wednesday morning to get
breakfast.
   Sulak said he didn't think the zoo suffered any major damage.

   ``Everyone is luckily safe and well and we're digging ourselves
out just like the rest of the city,'' Singer said in statement
relayed through Sumski on Wednesday.
   ``Last night we lost power and telephone lines. Power and phone
have been restored. For right now the set has remained closed.''

   Users of computer bulletin boards sought
word on family members electronically or alerted friends that they
were OK following the big earthquake.
   ``My car was uncontrollable and had to stop,'' Robert Ryan said
in a message left for other users of the Prodigy home computer
service. ``All I could really think about was how my kids were
doing and if anything happened to my home. ... Some of the streets
in Los Gatos had buckled. And there have been several deaths.''
   A man who signed himself Edgar Yergeau (Conn.) left a message
saying, ``If anyone in the Sacramento and Davis areas has a chance
to reply, I have friends whose children live in those areas, but
they cannot get through on the phones. I'd appreciate a response as
to how things are in those two areas.''

   Panama's Roman Catholic leaders are
becoming increasingly vocal in challenging strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, even at the risk of seeing some priests expelled
from the country.
   The latest sign of troubled relations between church and state
involved the deportation Tuesday of Sister Elsa Marie Schaus, the
Peruvian-born principal of a Catholic girls school.
   Sister Schaus, who had lived in Panama for 26 years, was told by
immigration officials she was being expelled for ``state security
reasons and for her own safety.''
   Some church officials also said officials mentioned problems in
her treatment of the daughters of government and military officials.
   ``Whatever the reason, there is no relationship between a matter
of school discipline and the expulsion from the country of the
school's director,'' said the Rev. Fernando Guardia, vicar of the
Panama City archdiocese.
   The church's relations with the government have been prickly
since the early 1970s.
   In 1971, the Rev. Hector Gallego, a Colombian priest,
disappeared while organizing peasants in western Santiago de
Veraguas province. Church officials say he was slain and blame the
Defense Forces, which Noriega now commands.
   Most church schools have traditionally served middle- and
upper-class civilian families, where opposition to Noriega is
concentrated.
   However, growing numbers of affluent military and government
officials have been sending their children to these schools in
recent years.
   Making matters more complex, 220 of Panama's 297 Catholic
priests and 424 of its 482 nuns are foreigners, mostly from Europe.
Government and military officials are in many cases especially wary
of the foreign clery.
   ``The government regards the church as an enemy,'' said Guardia.
``Because of the large number of foreign priests, it is a direct
threat to the church when the government threatens to expel the
foreign priests.''
   However, Guardia said the church will not be deterred in its
campaign against Noriega, even though Sister Schaus' expulsion
``would seem to indicate the beginning of another campaign against
the church.''
   ``But the church will continue its campaign to make people aware
of their diginity as human beings, of their human rights, because
the gospel is a message of liberation,'' he added.
   Noriega has been cracking down on his opponents since federal
grand juries in Florida indicted him on drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges February 1988.
   He survived a second military coup attempt on Oct. 3 and has
renewed efforts to eliminate opposition and consolidate power.
   Noriega has been closing down opposition news media and canceled
May 7 national elections when the returns showed that opposition
presidential candidate Guillermo Endara was winning by a 3-1
landslide.
   Panorama Catolico, the Panama City diocese weekly newspaper, is
the only opposition medium left in the country. It is sold at
churches every Sunday.
   Last week, it printed in a black box on the front page a prayer
for ``the dead, the wounded and their families.'' It was a clear
reference to the rebels from the latest attempted coup, 10 of whom
were killed.
   And in a letter in Panorama on Sept. 17, the nation's bishops
``noted with sadness that the people's will expressed in the
presidential elections has been ignored and the problems of our
people ... get worse every day.''
   Archbishop Marcos McGrath then angered the government-controlled
news media with an article deploring ``institutionalized violence
... and the violation of human rights.'' He urged a dialogue
between the country's political forces.
   Government newspapers and radio have been calling McGrath a
servant of the rich and contrasting him to Noriega, who is extolled
as a religious man and friend of the poor.

   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher says
Mexico is leading the way among Latin American nations trying to
strengthen their economies and assume a greater role in world trade.
   He told a Senate Banking subcommittee on Wednesday the
administration has high hopes ``Mexico will be the first olive out
of the jar'' in a succession of Latin economic successes and said
the long-range goal _ perhaps in 20 years _ should be a Western
Hemisphere with no trade barriers.
   Mosbacher said informal talks have already been held with
Mexican officials about working toward a free trade arrangement
similar to what the United States has with Canada.
   ``They are cautious,'' he said. ``We should not push them too
hard, too fast. But they are interested, very interested.''
   Mosbacher told the Senate Banking international finance and
monetary policy subcommittee that Mexico's new political leadership
is highly energetic and has taken significant steps to set a new
economic course.
   He said the nation's inflation rate has fallen to an annualized
rate of about 13 percent in the past few months and debt relief
agreements worked out with world lenders have freed up money for
domestic investments that are spurring the economy.
   He called Mexico's economic progress the best evidence that the
plan Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady outlined for restructuring
Third World debt can work.
   ``I agree the Brady plan will not work by itself, but it's part
of the puzzle,'' he said in response to skepticism from several
Democratic committee members.
   Mosbacher said a willingness by American businesses to put
long-term investments into Latin America is a key part of
administration's strategy in the region.
   ``Despite the discouragement of the debt problem,'' he said,
``we are seeing our major competitors making large new investments
in Latin America, particularly South America, and putting together
very competitive packages to capture major projects in sectors
where we have traditionally been preeminent.''
   Mosbacher said Japan is being particularly aggressive in moving
into Chile's mining sector and Venezuela's aluminum industry.
France is pushing hard in telecommunications in Brazil and Italy is
moving aggressively in Argentina, he said.
   ``These moves suggest that other industrial countries are taking
the long view, looking ahead to a brighter economic situation in
South America,'' said Mosbacher.

<HEAD>Advocates for Poor See Widening Gap Between Rich and Poor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's latest report on poverty
shows the gap between rich and poor is widening as the wealthy reap
a disproportionate share of the nation's record peacetime
expansion, advocates for the poor say.
   The poverty rate fell from 13.4 percent in 1987 to 13.1 percent
last year, and the number of impoverished people declined from 32.3
million to 31.9 million, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday. But
it said neither change was big enough to be statistically
significant.
   Robert Greenstein of the private Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities said the report ``provides disturbing evidence of the
unevenness of the (economic) recovery.''
   ``Its economic benefits are disproportionately going to those at
the top of the income spectrum and missing many at the bottom,'' he
said.
   The poorest fifth of the population received 4.6 percent of
total national family income in 1988, the lowest percentage since
1954, while the richest fifth received 44 percent, the highest ever
recorded, he said.
   The Census Bureau, however, chose to highlight a 1.7 percent
jump in real per capita income last year, to a new high of $13,120.
Blacks made bigger gains than whites, but still lagged far behind.
   Income for whites rose 1.5 percent to $13,900. Income for blacks
increased 3.9 percent to $8,270 and the figure for Hispanics was
virtually unchanged at $7,960.
   ``It's a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or
improved,'' said William Butz, the agency's associate director for
demographics.
   Greenstein said the per capita income figures are averages that
were pulled up by big gains for the richest Americans. He said
median household income showed no significant gains overall,
registering $27,230 in 1988, up from $27,140 a year earlier after
adjusting for the rise in consumer prices.
   Diana Pearce, director of the non-profit Women and Poverty
Project, said the census report contained troubling new evidence
that women are being left behind. For example, she said, 53 percent
of poor families in 1988 were headed by women alone, the highest
proportion on record.
   ``We are once again experiencing the feminization of poverty,''
she said.
   The annual release of the poverty report once again revived the
debate over the accuracy of the Census Bureau's figures.
   The conservative Heritage Foundation said Census overstates the
extent of poverty and underestimates the financial well-being of
millions of Americans.
   ``The 1988 Census data, though still deficient, thus show steady
and significant improvement for most Americans,'' said Kate Walsh
O'Beirne, a visiting fellow at Heritage.
   Census for the first time this year issued an alternative set of
poverty figures based on an experimental price index that it said
was more accurate.
   The alternate numbers _ published in an appendix to the official
report _ would cut the poverty rate for 1988 by 1.5 percentage
points to 11.6 percent and reduce by 3.6 million the number of
people classified as living in poverty.
   The congressional Joint Economic Committee criticized those
alternate figures as inaccurate and issued a report saying if the
poverty rate were calculated by what it said were more realistic
methods, the figures would be far higher.
   For example, while the official Census figure for 1987 was 13.5
percent, two better methods of calculation would have put the
poverty rate at 16.1 percent or 24.1 percent in 1987, the committee
said.
   ``This study indicates poverty is not declining. Rather, more
Americans are poor today than at any time since the 1960s,'' the
committee said in a statement.

<HEAD>All Homeowners Should Test for Radon Gas, EPA Says</HEAD>

   New tests show widespread contamination of
private homes in eight states with cancer-causing radon gas, the
Environmental Protection Agency says in urging all homeowners to
test for the gas.
   Radon is ``one of the most serious environmental health problems
today,'' EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said Wednesday.
``Radon can really be found anywhere.''
   Radon contamination is said to cause as many as 20,000 lung
cancer deaths year, second only to the number caused by smoking.
   The agency released test results showing that in eight states,
about one-fourth of 11,000 randomly tested homes had radon readings
considered unhealthy. Nearly three of four homes tested in Iowa had
significant radon readings.
   The results mirrored findings over the last two years in 17
other states. Overall, said the EPA, about one-fourth of the 37,000
homes tested in 25 states so far have shown unhealthy indoor radon
levels.
   Radon is a colorless and odorless gas that is produced naturally
by the decay of uranium in soil and rocks. While levels found
outdoors normally pose no health concerns, concentrations of 4
picocuries per liter of air indoors are considered unhealthy.
   Among the 25 states, Iowa was found to have the most widespread
radon problem. Seventy-one percent of the 1,381 homes tested had
more than 4 picocuries per liter and 8 percent showed more than 20
picocuries per liter.
   Reilly estimated that as many as 10 million homes may have
year-round average radon levels that exceed 4 picocuries per liter
of air. So far only 2 million homes have been tested for the gas.
   In an effort to boost radon testing, the EPA and the Advertising
Council announced a national public service advertising campaign to
warn about the dangers from radon and urge testing of all homes.
   Ruth Wooden, the council's president, said research conducted in
connection with the ad campaign showed that even when people are
aware of a potential radon health problem, they are reluctant to
test. A survey of 1,000 people showed two-thirds believe radon to
be a health concern, but only 14 percent said they plan to do
anything about it.
   ``People believe they are safe in their homes,'' she said.
   Radon often seeps into a house through cracks and foundation
openings. The EPA estimates that correcting the problem is often
relatively simple _ perhaps as easy as creating additional venting
of the gas to the outside.
   Test kits cost about $20 and corrective action normally costs
from $200 to $1,500, according to the EPA.
   The latest tests covered Iowa, Georgia, Maine, New Mexico, Ohio,
West Virginia, Vermont and Alaska as well as three Indian Health
Service regions: Aberdeen in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and
Nebraska; Bemidji in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin; and
Albuquerque in Colorado and New Mexico.
   Here are the percentages of homes found with radon levels of
more than 4 picocuries per liter: Iowa, 71 percent; Maine, 30
percent; Ohio, 29 percent; New Mexico, 23 percent; West Virginia
and Vermont, 16 percent; Georgia and Alaska, 8 percent.
   Results in the Indian Health Service regions: Aberdeen, 35
percent; Bemidji, 20 percent; Albuquerque, 17 percent.
   A year ago, 46 percent of the homes tested in Minnesota and 63
percent of those in North Dakota exceeded the EPA guideline for
healthy air.
   Ten locations this year showed radon above 100 picocuries per
liter of air, which according to EPA is equivalent to more than
2,000 chest X-rays each year or smoking four packs of cigarettes a
day.
   The highest reading was at a house on the Lower Brule Indian
Reservation in South Dakota, 316 picocuries per liter.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan anti-communist rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi says he believes the truce with Angola's leftist government
can be revived within the next two weeks even though a cease-fire
attempt four months ago was unsuccessful.
   Savimbi also said in a telephone interview Wednesday from the
Ivory Coast that a mutual prisoner exchange with the Angolan
government is possible.
   After reaching a high point last June, the Angolan peace process
has been bogged down by a resumption of fighting between government
and rebel forces as well as disagreements between Savimbi and
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, the chief peace mediator.
   Savimbi also angered his principal foreign patron, the United
States, when he declined to attend talks last month designed to
reinstate the cease-fire which had been agreed to last June.
   On Wednesday, Savimbi sounded upbeat following his weekend talks
in France with Mobutu and his earlier discussions in Washington
with President Bush. At one point recently, Savimbi was concerned
that Mobutu had abandoned impartiality and was siding with the
Angolan government.
   Savimbi made no reference Wednesday to a resumption of direct
talks with the Angolan government but said he was optimistic a
cease-fire could be back on track ``during this month of October.''
He raised the possibility that some African nations might
contribute troops to monitor the cease-fire if it is revived.
   But even if a truce is agreed to, the MPLA government and UNITA
face the challenging task of reaching a political settlement. With
U.S. support, UNITA is calling for free and fair elections to be a
key ingredient of the peace process.
   The Angolan government has a much narrower view of national
reconciliation, insisting the existing constitution remain
unchanged.
   But Savimbi said recent statements by senior Angolan officials
suggest a more flexible attitude on reconciliation.
   They are ``not so intransigent'' as they were before, said
Savimbi, who stopped off in the Ivory Coast while en route to his
home base in rebel-held southeast Angola.
   Discussing the possibility of a prisoner exchange, Savimbi said
there are between 3,000 and 5,000 MPLA prisoners in UNITA hands. He
said the government has refused to disclose the number of rebel
prisoners it holds.
   While the government receives substantial backing from the
Soviet Union, UNITA has been getting about $40 million annually
from the United States. UNITA has been at war with the MPLA
government for 14 years.

<HEAD>Predicting Earthquakes, Scientists Say Where But Not When</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Even as residents of Northern California
begin the process of rebuilding, scientists are launching research
efforts in hopes of learning something from Tuesday's earthquake to
help them warn people the next time.
   And there will be a next time. Scientists can predict that and
say approximately where the tremor will strike.
   It's when that troubles them.
   The Loma Prieta area where Tuesday's quake was focused, for
example, was singled out as a region where a quake was considered
likely. But scientists couldn't pin down the time except to say
sometime between 1988 and 2018.
   Like weather forecasters a century ago, geologists today look at
what has happened in the past and try to use that information to
predict what will come in the future.
   But while today's weather satellites allow meteorologists a
bird's-eye view of the approaching weather, geologists still
struggle to analyze events miles below the land surface.
   ``It's difficult to make short-term predictions of
earthquakes,'' admitted Robert Wesson, chief of the Office of
Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Engineering at the U.S. Geological
Survey.
   ``I would say there was a successful long-term prediction of
this quake,'' he said, pointing out the Survey report issued last
year.
   ``Unfortunately, we didn't have any warning of this earthquake
last night,'' said Wesson.
   ``Really, we don't know how to make short-term predictions of
earthquakes, either little ones or big ones,'' he admitted.
   Sometimes smaller shocks foreshadow a major quake, and that may
have happened in this case too.
   The region had remained relatively quiet for several years,
until a quake estimated at 5.1 on the Richter scale occurred on
June 27, 1988, and another rated at 5.2 struck on Aug. 8 of this
year.
   Those events prompted the agency to pay increased attention to
the Loma Prieta region and to notify California officials, Wesson
said. But little could be done beyond that because there was no way
to tell if the tremors were foreshocks or just individual quakes on
their own.
   Using historical records of quakes, measurements of ground
motion and other analyses, scientists are able to single out places
where they believe tremors will strike _ much as they were able to
predict that the Mount St. Helen's volcano would erupt _ but not
when.
   Such predictions ``are not useful in evacuating dangerous
buildings, but they are useful in land use planning and resource
allocation in anticipation of future events,'' said Wesson.
   Dave Russ, assistant chief geologist at the Survey, explained
that quakes occurring along faults in the earth release stress that
builds up over time. When this movement releases stress in one area
the strain can be increased in other spots. But whether that would
induce major quakes in those areas cannot be predicted, he said.
   A strong quake does trigger thousands of smaller aftershocks as
the many rocks along the fault line adjust themselves, and there
remains the chance of strong aftershocks, he said.
   Russ said officials are looking for ``any unusual
characteristics'' in their studies of the quake, measured by
sensitive equipment that calculates the movement of land, changes
in the strain on rocks and uplift of the earth, among other things.
They hope their findings will help them understand, and thus
predict, future quakes.

   A United Airlines 747 with 145 passengers made an
unscheduled landing at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport after
the pilot shut down one of the jumbo jet's four engines,
authorities said.
   Flight 137 was bound for Tokyo from San Francisco when the pilot
shut down the No. 4 engine because of a problem with the engine
pressure ratio, United spokesman Joe Hopkins said.
   The plane landed Wednesday night without a problem, said Hugh
Wilson, airport supervisor. A precautionary crash crew was on hand.
   Hopkins said the stop was just a precaution, ``nothing that far
out of the ordinary.''
   A Boeing 747 can fly from San Francisco to Tokyo on three
engines, Hopkins said.
   The passengers were to be flown to Tokyo today on a Continental
flight after an overnight stay in Seattle, Hopkins said. The 747's
engine was being replaced, he added.

<TEXT>
   Private groups and officials from Tokyo to London to Charleston,
S.C., offered help to the ruptured San Francisco Bay area, but some
said relief for the earthquake could drain coffers already strained
by previous disasters.
   Los Angeles, long San Francisco's West Coast competitor but
equally at the mercy of the San Andreas Fault, quickly shipped
doctors, sonic equipment and fire investigators to the Bay Area.
   The mayor of a sister city in disaster, Charleston's Joseph P.
Riley Jr., sent a plane load of drinking water, a symbolic return
of the support his city got after Hugo.
   ``I know we still have and will have great needs here and
charity certainly begins at home,'' Riley said. ``However, it would
be wrong for this community ... not to reach in (our pockets) and
contribute to those who are hurt and suffering right now.''
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos has estimated damage $2 billion in
his city alone.
   The Salvation Army had the food cooking almost before the earth
quit shaking in Northern California, while the Red Cross opened the
doors and unfolded cots in 25 shelters.
   ``We don't wait for anybody,'' said Col. Leon Ferraez,
communications director of the Salvation Army. ``We're there the
minute the news is on.''
   According to Ferraez, the organization dispatched 12 mobile
canteens to the hardest-hit earthquake areas within minutes. All
Salvation Army centers in the Bay Area, including 34 community
service centers and scores of other units, have been turned over to
the relief effort.
   Los Angeles donated sonic equipment to help detect sounds of
people trapped in rubble. And officials in Los Alamos, N.M.,
dispatched a device used to locate survivors of last year's
Armenian quake.
   Israel offered the services of a special army rescue squad that
also helped dig out victims in Armenia. A French disaster relief
agency offered to send special teams of searchers.
   A team of British engineers were to fly to San Francisco today
to help assess structural damage from the quake.
   The Bay Area has a large Asian population, and callers from
Japan and the Philippines and other countries jammed phone lines
trying to reach relatives.
   The Osaka, Japan, city government announced it was sending
$10,000 to San Francisco, a sister city since 1957.
   Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley sent police and fire investigators
to assess damage from the quake, and convened his own emergency
council in a special meeting to discuss other possible measures.
   ``I am joining millions of Californians as we intensely watch
the damage of the large San Francisco earthquake,'' said Bradley.
``We all know the horrors of an earthquake and we express our
deep-felt sympathy for the people of the San Francisco Bay area.''
   An Anheuser-Busch Inc. brewery in Fairfield, 35 miles northeast
of San Francisco, interrupted normal operations to fill cans with
drinking water instead of beer for free shipment to relief
agencies, the company said.
   Coast Guard offices across the West Coast provided San Francisco
with as many boats and helicopters as could be spared, said Coast
Guard spokeswoman Elizabeth Neely.
   The Red Cross sent 290 units of blood from Los Angeles; the San
Diego Blood Bank rushed 50 units to San Francisco within an hour of
the quake; more than 400 units were sent from Portland, Ore.
   ``Giving makes them feel good,'' said Trudy Sullivan, a Red
Cross spokeswoman in Portland.
   Even the Internal Revenue Service got into the act, announcing
it would waive penalties for taxpayers unable to file returns or
make scheduled payments because of the earthquake.
   President Bush directed $273 million in immediate aid for quake
victims and said he would visit the area Friday or Saturday.
   But some officials said the disaster could strain the coffers of
private agencies and those of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which was criticized for its response to the storm-lashed
Carolinas.
   The Red Cross began its fiscal year July 1 with $18.5 million in
its disaster budget, and had spent 40 percent by September. Then
Hugo came along, triggering an effort the agency estimates will
cost $42 million _ the most ever.
   ``When a major earthquake and a major hurricane hit
back-to-back, you can bet it will stretch Red Cross disaster
resources and manpower,'' said Bob Vessey, director of disaster
services in Washington, D.C.

   Atlantis' astronauts are trying
their hands at cinematography, growing corn and photographing
lightning as they orbit Earth.
   The crew completed its main task about six hours after the
shuttle soared into orbit Wednesday, dispatching the Galileo probe
riding in its cargo bay on a six-year journey to Jupiter.
   During their five-day mission the astronauts will be busy
completing several new experiments and some that were conducted on
earlier shuttles.
   One experiment will measure sections of the Earth's protective
ozone layer with an instrument that calculates the amount of solar
irradiance from the sun and how much irradiance is scattered back,
never reaching the Earth.
   That information will be compared to data taken by nearly
identical instruments on three satellites. Researchers want to
calibrate data from the satellites with measurements taken on the
shuttle, said Michael Braukas, a spokesman for NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   ``They're curious to see whether or not the readings (from the
satellites) are true,'' Braukas said. NASA plans to fly the
experiment on several more shuttle flights.
   Ozone in the stratosphere can block much of the sun's harmful
ultraviolet radiation. When the ozone layer is intact, it prevents
damaging levels of ultraviolet radiation from reaching Earth.
   Atlantis' five astronauts also planned to monitor corn seedlings
in four special canisters as part of an experiment aimed at
determining how gravity affects developing plants. The plants were
to be frozen after four days of growth and then studied on Earth.
   Researchers hope the experiment one day will help them devise
ways to grow food in space and improve crops on Earth.
   Astronauts plan to conduct several more experiments, including:
   _Testing the effects of microgravity on three materials _
polyethylene, nylong and a polymer blend _ when they are heated and
then cooled.
   _Placing purified water on two copper plates to see how crystals
develop in microgravity and at what temperature they form. The
experiment is designed to learn more about how ice forms and better
determine development of clouds and weather conditions.
   Tracy L. Peters, 25, a physics student at the University of
California, Berkeley, designed the experiment. He was a high school
senior in Walnut Creek, Calif., when his experiment was among the
student projects selected by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to fly on shuttle missions. ``It's nice to see it
finally getting ready to go,'' Peters said.
   _Photographing lightning at night. Researchers hope the
experiment will lead to better understanding of lightning systems
and possibly learning more about predicting the weather.
   _Using the powerful IMAX camera to take footage for two planned
films called ``Exploring the Blue Planet,'' and ``To the Stars.''
IMAX film taken on three previous flights was used in one film
about shuttle missions for the giant-screen theaters around the
world.
   Several medical experiments also were to be conducted, including
measuring the natural radiation background of the atmosphere, said
Patrick Air Force Base spokesman Capt. Dave Thurston.

<HEAD>Parents Seek to Ban Roald Dahl Book, `The Witches'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents trying to ban a children's book
about witches lack a sense of humor, British author Roald Dahl said.
   Dahl's book ``The Witches'' should be removed from the library
at Broadwater Elementary School in Billings because it refers to
witches, parents Sue and Monte Mutschler said Wednesday.
   ``The fact is that there are such things as witches. They are
part of the satanic church,'' Monte Mutschler said.
   ``This book is a fantasy and an enormous joke,'' Dahl responded
in a telephone interview from his home in England. ``We all know
that witches don't exist, not the way I've written about them. They
are parents without any sense of humor at all.''
   Dahl _ the author of several popular children's books, including
``Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,'' which was made into the
movie, ``Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' _ suggested that
the school district let the children help decide the book's fate in
the school library.
   ``The last chap I heard of who banned books was Hitler,'' Dahl
said. ``The banning of any book, you know especially a children's
book, is unforgivable.''
   Jim Strecker, the school's principal, said he will head a
committee of educators to consider removing ``The Witches'' from
the school library.
   The book has been used in the school for several years without
complaints, Strecker said, adding that Dahl ``is well-known and
this particular book is widely read.''
   ``The Witches,'' published in 1983, is being made into a movie
by Muppets creator Jim Henson, Dahl said.
   The effort to ban the book comes a week after parents in
Maryland and Texas urged school officials to limit observance of
Halloween because they said the holiday is linked to devil worship.
   Several Maryland school officials canceled traditional Halloween
costume parties, opting to hold fall and harvest celebrations
instead, while officials in that state and Texas said they would
take a look at the role of Halloween in the schools.

   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Thursday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
moderately.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 266.66
points, or 0.76 percent, ending at 35,374.22. It gained 111.48
points Wednesday.
   The dollar ended at 141.55 yen, down 0.55 yen from Wednesday's
142.10 yen-close. It started lower at 140.97 yen and moved between
140.80 yen and 141.70 yen.
   The dollar opened sharply lower as investment trust companies
overseas sold dollars to reduce their holdings of the currency,
then rose marginally in Tokyo and ranged mainly around 140.50 yen,
said Yoshitsugu Hanada, a trader for Mitsui Bank in Tokyo.
   ``The dollar has been gradually falling as market players are
inclined to sell it following a series of recent economic figures
in America, which have indicated the slowdown in economy there,''
he said. He cited the $10.8 billion trade deficit reported Tuesday
and Friday's stock market plunge on Wall Street.
   ``Although the exchange rate doesn't move much in one day, the
dollar is getting weaker slowly but surely,'' he said.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei, the market's major barometer,
rose ``intermittently but steadily,'' despite selling by
speculative investors for their arbitrage deals, said a dealer with
New Japan Securities Co. Ltd.
   The Tokyo market has been getting stronger, the dealer added,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

   Federal disaster officials said they
would not siphon off Hurricane Hugo relief to help the San
Francisco area, and Charleston showed its sympathy to earthquake
victims by sending a planeload of water.
   ``We are in the process of recovering from a disaster. So we
will feel what is occurring there more deeply than any community in
the country,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said Wednesday.
   He said the national response to the victims of last month's
hurricane was heartwarming, and reminded him of his pledge that
``if ever another community in the United States ... was hit with a
disaster, we would want to respond.'' He set up a California
Earthquake Disaster Relief Fund to raise money for earthquake
victims.
   The Air Force C-141 transport that left Wednesday carrying
potable water also carried Police Chief Reuben Greenberg and
several Charleston police officers to help with emergency
operations in California.
   Hugo smashed into Charleston with 135 mph winds on Sept. 21,
prompting a nationwide outpouring of supplies and food for disaster
victims.
   Riley just returned from the San Francisco Bay area, where he
attended the first two games of the World Series.
   Officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, meanwhile,
said the response to the earthquake will not mean any curtailment
of the agency's operations in South Carolina.
   Coordinating officer Paul Hall said the $1.1 billion earmarked
by Congress for the Hugo recovery will be replenished as needed to
address other disasters.
   ``They must have learned some lessons,'' said Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., a critic of the FEMA response in South Carolina.
He said FEMA responded quickly to the earthquake.
   ``I just hope for one thing: They won't take two weeks to
declare it a 100 percent disaster area,'' he said.
   It wasn't until two weeks after Hugo hit that the federal
government said it would cover all the cleanup costs in South
Carolina.

<HEAD>Center Calls For Educating Teen-Agers On AIDS Prevention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Center for Population Options says massive
public education and prevention programs are imperative to stem the
rapid spread of AIDS among teen-agers.
   The center said schools, churches, community organizations and
parents must do a better job correcting misinformation about AIDS,
helping teen-agers delay sexual intercourse, ensuring that those
who do have sex use condoms and warning teen-agers about the
dangers of drug use.
   ``Our children have a right to straightforward, accurate
information about HIV infection and how to prevent it,'' said a
report issued Wednesday by the nonprofit educational center. The
center is partially funded by the Centers for Disease Control.
   The number of AIDS cases among teen-agers jumped by 43 percent
to 398 between July 1988 and July 1989, according to the CDC.
   But because the time between infection and the onset of AIDS can
be as long as 10 years, public health officials believe that many
people with AIDS who are now in their 20s may have picked up the
virus when they were teen-agers.

<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development is seeking to recover about $700,000 from a former
Reagan campaign adviser and his partners in a Georgia project and
also has a dispute with the group over another development,
according to an agency official.
   The decision to ask the partnership to forfeit about $700,000 is
a reversal of an unusual decision made earlier this year at HUD
headquarters that has piqued the interest of congressional
investigators reviewing allegations of political favoritism at HUD
during the Reagan administration.
   The department now will seek repayment from the owners of the
Cypress Mill Plantation in Brunswick, Ga., including Edward
Weidenfeld, legal counsel to Reagan's 1980 campaign and an adviser
to his 1984 re-election effort.
   Neil Zittrauer, HUD's housing chief in Atlanta, said Wednesday
he hoped to reach agreement with the owners on the Brunswick
project and would consider legal action if he can't.
   Weidenfeld, a Washington attorney, declined comment when
contacted at his office.

   The new chairman of the National Endowment for
the Arts says he's begun to calm a congressional uproar over
obscenity and vows to seek greater financial support for the arts,
including a possible appeal to millionaire rock stars for donations.
   John E. Frohnmayer told reporters Wednesday he had met twice
recently with Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the endowment's harshest
critic, and was assured that Helms was not trying to abolish the
agency.
   At Helms' urging, Congress recently banned federal spending on
materials the endowment chairman determines ``may be considered
obscene'' and lacking in serious artistic, literary, political or
scientific value.
   The ban was prompted by conservative legislators' complaints
that NEA funds were used by modern art institutes in Philadelphia
and Winston-Salem, N.C., to support exhibitions of controversial
works by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano.
   Frohnmayer succeeded Frank Hodsoll as endowment chairman Oct. 3.

   A saboteur ripped insulation laced with
cancer-causing asbestos from pipes at Nassau County government
offices and placed it in front of air-circulation fans, police said.
   The fans were shut off when the asbestos was found, and tests
found no dangerous levels in the air at the County Executive
Building, Health Department spokeswoman Shelly Domash said
Wednesday.
   Airborne asbestos fibers can be inhaled and cause debilitating
lung disease and even lung cancer.
   Inspector Donald White, of Nassau County Police Department, said
the asbestos insulation also was found in front of a fan at police
headquarters but officials didn't test the air because they
believed the material was found soon enough to prevent danger.
   ``This is not an act of vandalism,'' White said. ``Someone
intentionally ripped the asbestos off the pipes and strategically
put it in an area which they thought could hurt someone.''
   County engineers also found torn insulation in front of fans in
a third county building, but that insulation contained no asbestos,
authorities said.
   The three rooms involved are locked and located in secured areas
which are not easily accessible without identification cards, White
said. There was no evidence of a break-in.
   ``Someone didn't walk off the street and do this,'' he said.
``The individual or individuals had to know what they were doing
and had access to the areas.''
   Asbestos insulation was found in front of fans Monday and
Tuesday at the county police headquarters and an underground
emergency operations center behind police headquarters.
   No problems had been found in the ventilation rooms when they
were checked by the same engineer on routine rounds 24 hours
earlier, according to White.
   There are 300 to 400 county employees in the three buildings.
   ``It could have been anyone: a disgruntled employee, maybe
someone who is trying to make a statement,'' White said.

   Officially, at least, no one was born
Wednesday in this city of 740,000 people. No one died. No one was
married either.
   The doors to City Hall, like so many others in this once-vibrant
and remarkably resilient metropolis, were barred.
   ``Haven't had one customer the entire day,'' said police officer
W. Cunningham, the lone sentry posted at the rear entrance to San
Francisco's grand City Hall. ``No babies, no couples. In fact, no
one's asked about any kind of license.
   ``And anyway,'' he added, ``who'd be in this much of a hurry to
get married?''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Licenses aside, San Franciscans went about their business with
few differences from their counterparts elsewhere in the United
States, just one day after a catastrophic earthquake wrenched
California's western elbow. And many managed the feat without the
amenities everyone else was taking for granted: electricity and
running water, telephones and easy access to fast food.
   Some people, in fact, barely noticed the difference. Chris Walk,
who with wife Flo, fled Chicago 2{ years ago for warmer
temperatures and the vague promise of work, pointed toward a roll
of blankets under a tree in Civic Cneter Plaza and said, ``That's
my home.''
   ``And after what happened,'' he added, ``I'd rather be living
out here anyway.''
   A bottle of cooking oil and a box of bread-crumb coating mix sat
opened on a bench nearby as Flo Walk fried up red snapper on a
small metal grate atop a tall steel cylinder. Behind her, the late
afternoon sun glistened off City Hall's polished walls.
   ``A lot of people will be eating like us tonight,'' she said.
``But the funny thing is we had enough money last night for a hotel
room. That's where we were when all the shaking started. Can you
believe that?''

   In the waterfront Marina District, where homes run into the
millions of dollars and the Golden Gate Bridge is visible in the
distance from some of the gently sloping streets, Barbara Forte
stands behind a police line and shakes her head.
   ``My home is trashed, absolutely trashed,'' she said. ``But I'm
one of the lucky ones. I got out.''
   She didn't need to be reminded that the neighborhood was San
Francisco's hardest-hit community. The three-story apartment
building in front of her _ once her home _ was now reduced to two.
At the far western end of the block-long structure, the only proof
that the structure had garages on the first floor is the gray Ford
that sits flattened beneath it.
   Little more than a block away, a second apartment building
teeters precariously and next to that one, smoke crawled lazily
toward a coastal sky from the wreckage of an apartment building.
   Over a loudspeaker, police warned residents and media alike to
evacuate the area or be arrested.
   Forte, in her 60s and a resident of Marina for much of that
time, leaned across the tape and asked a favor from a military
policeman in full fatigues.
   ``Just watch out for looters, will you young man?''
   Jeffery Mehegan, who hails from Massachusetts and once
considered himself lucky to be posted on the coast, smiled back
reassuringly, ``Yes ma'am, I certainly will.''

<HEAD>Guerrilla Leader Ready for New Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT WELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi says
he is ready to resume negotiations with Angola's Marxist government
and hopes a new cease-fire can be signed within a month.
   ``We are ready to talk anywhere,'' he said Wednesday in a
telephone interview during a stop in Abidjan. ``I think the
cease-fire will be signed this month because the mood is good.''
   He said his side wants the new truce to include monitors
provided by other African countries and release of all prisoners
through the International Red Cross.
   The guerrilla chief, who has U.S. support, said he was in
Abidjan to brief President Felix Houphouet-Boigny on weekend talks
in France with President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. Savimbi leads
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as
UNITA.
   Mobutu has mediated negotiations toward ending the 14-year-old
war in the former Portuguese colony and was host for four days of
talks on the French Riviera with Angolan, South African and U.S.
officials.
   He negotiated a cease-fire in the conflict between UNITA and the
ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, known as the
MPLA, during a meeting June 22 at his home village of Gbadolite,
but it broke down within days.
   Savimbi subsequently rejected Mobutu's mediation, accusing the
Zairean leader of siding with the Angolan government. He refused to
attend a meeting of African heads of state last month in Kinshasa,
capital of Zaire, aimed at reviving the negotiations.
   At issue were the claim of several African leaders that Savimbi
had agreed to go into exile and the integration of his guerrillas
into Angola's armed forces. Savimbi said no such an agreement,
which he described as a defeat, had been made at Gbadolite.
   The United States, which has supported Mobutu's government
despite criticizing his human rights record, was caught between two
allies.
   Some congressional supporters of Savimbi said Mobutu, the main
conduit of $40 million in annual U.S. aid to UNITA, had blocked the
flow of weapons.
   After the Kinshasa meeting, Mobutu, Savimbi and Angolan
officials went to the United States, where President Bush met
separately with Mobutu and the guerrilla leader, urging new
negotiations.
   The French Riviera meeting was held a few days later and Savimbi
declared Wednesday it was a success.
   ``President Mobutu has reassured us that the basis of our work
in negotiations will be and will remain the Gbadolite agreement,''
he said.
   ``So we are reconciled on that,'' Savimbi said. ``He has been
our friend in the past and I think we can consider our relations
with him very good, and we have renewed our confidence in him as a
mediator.''
   Mobutu has said recent interviews in which Foreign Minister
Pedro van Dunem Loy of Angola said Savimbi should discuss the
issues of exile and integration, were encouraging.
   Savimbi said Wednesday: ``When they (MPLA) say exile has to be
discussed, good. I think they are coming along. Mobutu has also
said once the cease-fire is signed, the rest of the political
problem will be discussed by UNITA and the MPLA, face to face,
because it is an Angolan problem. Others should be called in only
if we have problems.''

   A judge has ordered the state to restore
unemployment benefits about 12,000 striking phone workers. New
England Telephone immediately appealed the ruling.
   Wednesday's decision by Suffolk Superior Court Judge Elbert
Tuttle reversed an Oct. 6 decision by state Employment and Training
Commissioner James French to deny benefits to the strikers, most of
whom belong to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   ``The Legislature never intended to have the unemployment
compensation law turned into a strike fund for unions and this
would be the result if today's decision is not overturned,''
company spokesman Peter Cronin said.
   Under Massachusetts' unemployment compensation law, strikers are
paid benefits unless a company shows the walkout has resulted in a
``substantial curtailment'' of its operations.
   The union sued, arguing the law's confidentiality provision
denied them the right to examine and rebut the company's evidence.

<TEXT>
   The strongest typhoon to strike the
Philippines this year lashed the east coast of Luzon Island today
with 127 mph winds after residents of areas in its path were told
to seek higher ground.
   Advance winds from Typhoon Elsie struck land at midday near
Casiguran, 130 miles north of Manila, and the center of the storm
was expected to come ashore a few hours later, according to the
Manila Weather Bureau.
   Storm warnings were issued for all of Luzon, the main
Philippines island, and at U.S. military installations.
   ``Any typhoon of this strength is capable of massive
destruction,'' said forecaster Vicente Manalo.
   Elsie's westward path would take it across the rugged mountains
of northeastern Luzon and across the north-central agricultural
heartland about 100 miles north of the capital.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage, but
Manila radio stations said they received sketchy reports of
flooding and landslides in the north.
   Manila radio station DZXL said its affiliate in Bayombong,
capital of Nueva Vizcaya province 130 miles to the north, was
knocked off the air by a power failure.
   U.S. officials said all six American military installations on
Luzon had been placed on maximum typhoon alert.
   U.S. Air Force forecasters predicted the storm would pass about
50 miles north of Clark Air Base but near the U.S. John Hay Air
Station in Baguio, 130 miles north of Manila.
   The storm was reported moving about 12 mph and was expected to
weaken as it crossed the Sierra Madre mountains of northeastern
Luzon.
   Philippine Airlines canceled flights from Manila to northern
Luzon, and the coast guard ordered ships to stay in port in the
affected area.
   U.S. Air Force officials said some jets had been moved to air
bases in Japan and South Korea until the storm passed.
   The Far East Network, which broadcasts to the 40,000-member U.S.
military community, advised residents at Clark, John Hay and the
U.S.-run Wallace Air Station to stock up on fresh water,
flashlights, candles and other emergency equipment.
   Residents at the U.S.-run Subic Bay naval base, 50 miles
northwest of Manila, were also advised to take precautions.
   Base spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri said there were relatively
few warships in port ``so we're not going to have a very big exodus
if the conditions worsen.''
   The Navy routinely sends warships into the South China Sea when
storms threaten Subic.
   Elsie was the third major storm to strike the Philippines in two
weeks.
   Typhoon Dan hit Manila and southern Luzon on Oct. 10, killing at
least 59 people. On Oct. 6, Typhoon Angela killed at least 119
people in northern Luzon.
   An average of 20 typhoons and tropical storms strike the
Philippines annually. Elsie was the 17th of 1989.

   Near the crest of California Street, Jane

their young children might be wandering in the stricken area.
   The emotional trial of the Springwaters was just one of many in
the Bay area quake catastrophe. But their story shares a common
thread with all families who struggled to find each other across a
disrupted urban landscape.
   ``You could see large plumes of smoke coming from the Marina,''

the day they go down to the Marina. And my mom had said earlier in
the day they were going ... but I had no idea if my kids were in a
car, if they were walking. ...
   ``Not until we reached Nob Hill could we see the smoke,'' she
said. ``And it looked bad _ it looked like a huge fire.''
   Like many working couples, the Springwaters were at their
offices, away from their children, when the quake struck Tuesday
evening.
   Jane, a 33-year-old attorney, sat at her 39th-floor desk as the
shock wave rumbled through.
   For a moment or two, she said, she thought only of moving away
from her window, into the hall.
   ``And then, all I could think of was, `Oh my God! my kids. I
have no idea where my kids are.'''
   But she had a clue. On Tuesdays, Benjamin, 4, and Hannah, 1{,
usually went to the Marina with their babysitter. And their
grandmother, visiting from New York, said that that was where they
were going to go Tuesday.
   ``I called my husband as soon as the quake hit. His receptionist
picked up the line. I asked for him, and the lines went dead.''
   With no link to her family, Jane turned to the trickle of news
reports on radio and television. They were sketchy. But one thing
seemed pretty clear: the Marina was taking a beating. The area was
devastated by fire.
   Richard, 37, worked in his office five blocks from Jane's in the
financial district.
   ``Since I'm an architect, I went into the elevator core,'' he
said.
   The area between elevators is a building's most solid component,
he said. ``I don't really trust buildings.
   ``I wasn't worried about the Marina though,'' he said, recalling
his feelings when hearing on the radio that the district was
flattened. ``I didn't know the kids were in the Marina.''
   The Springwaters had talked a lot about putting together an
earthquake contingency plan but they never quite worked out the
details.
   So Richard started walking, moving past dazed, disoriented
financial district regulars shuffling along on the sidewalk. Jane
didn't show up at the front of her building. The elevators weren't
operating. So he opened the door and started up 39 floors.
   His wife already was well on her way down the same escape route.
   ``Had I left 10 minutes earlier, he would have climbed 39 floors
to find I wasn't there,'' she said.
   Jane shared her fears about their children.
   Benjamin, Hannah and Gramma had left the Marina just minutes
before the quake, though, to go shopping.
   In fact, they scarcely knew they were in the middle of the
second-deadliest quake in U.S. history.
   When the Springwaters arrived at their Pacific Heights
neighborhood, two hours after the initial jolt, everything looked
perfect.
   Their century-old house, a survivor of the 1906 catastrophe,
stood in place, brick for brick.
   ``When I got home and opened the door,'' Jane said, ``everyone
was there. They had eaten dinner. And my son was excited that there
were no lights.''

<HEAD>Bush Administration Calls Shamir's Criticism Unhelpful and Disappointing</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: SUBS 8th graf to update to show Shamir delivered speech</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Even while asserting it seeks no confrontation
with Israel, the Bush administration is accusing Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir of hampering Mideast peace efforts with unhelpful
and disappointing remarks.
   Meanwhile, in another development, a U.S. official said PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat had sent word to the State Department that
he did not intend to apply for a visa to attend a U.N. General
Assembly debate next month on the Middle East.
   Intermediaries had informed Arafat that seeking entry would be
``controversial'' and then word came back that he did not intend to
ask for a visa, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Reagan administration last year denied Arafat a visa and the
United Nations responded by moving its Middle East discussion to
Geneva, Switzerland.
   Since then, the United States has opened talks with the PLO.
Fourteen PLO officials were permitted to attend the U.N. General
Assembly session this fall.
   Chastising Shamir from the State Department press room podium,
U.S. officials insisted their overriding goal was to arrange talks
between Israel and Palestinian Arabs.
   That effort is running into roadblocks in Jerusalem and also
within the Palestine Liberation Organization, which rejects it
outright.
   In a speech delivered Wednesday night to a gathering of
fundamentalist Christians in Jerusalem, Shamir again went on the
offensive. ``This is our land from the dawn of history, and it will
be so always,'' he said. ``We will not be pushed or pressured.''
   The prime minister, in a closed meeting Tuesday with legislators
from his Likud political coalition, said Israel might be ``entering
a period of tension with the United States,'' Israel Radio reported.
   He also said ``the battle is hard. It's a miracle that thus far
we have held our own against the world where no element supports
our position.''
   Shamir again rejected Secretary of State James A. Baker III's
attempt to arrange negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians
in Cairo prior to holding elections. Shamir said the meeting would
be a trap to make Israel ``slide into recognition of a Palestinian
state.''
   The prime minister also was quoted as saying Israel was without
friends in the United States.
   Baker's spokeswoman, Margaret Tutwiler, described that remark as
``ludicrous'' and added: ``The United States and Israel are good
friends and good allies and have been for many, many years, and
that's very well known.''
   Asked about Shamir's other remarks, the spokeswoman read this
prepared statement:
   ``We've said all along that all sides should refrain from
statements that make it harder to advance the peace process. The
statement he made yesterday was unhelpful and we are disappointed.
   ``We are not looking for a fight or a confrontation with Israel.
Everyone knows that. Our only purpose is to help the government of
Israel to advance its own peace initiative.''
   However, Ms. Tutwiler said that Baker did not mention Shamir's
criticism of U.S. strategy once during a long telephone
conversation with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   ``If this was such a burning issue with Secretary Baker, it
seems to me it would have been the first thing he brought up this
morning on the phone,'' Tutwiler said. ``I am telling you it did
not come up once.''
   Ms. Tutwiler also had some criticism for the PLO, whose Central
Council on Monday rejected Baker's five-point plan for
Israeli-Palestinian talks. Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's
political department, was quoted on Tuesday as saying the U.S.
stance did not reflect a serious move toward a just settlement in
the region.
   ``If Palestinians want to participate they must find a way to
engage practically in a dialogue with Israel. Statements out of
Baghdad ... also were unhelpful,'' the spokeswoman said.

   West Oakland, a drug-plagued neighborhood
of broken glass, shaken buildings and people, marshaled its
resources to help the people they knew were trapped under the
Nimitz Freeway.
   After the double-decked Cypress portion of Interstate 880 caved
in during Tuesday's earthquake, residents came quickly to the
rescue, mobilizing to provide tools, rescue squads and support
services.
   ``I haven't seen that much love in Oakland in a long time,''
said Greg Roberts, a street vendor. ``It was something to see.''
   Police Lt. Larry Eade praised the community that tried to help
the victims of the freeway disaster.
   ``They climbed up on the bridge to take people off. They lined
up to volunteer. They established medical help as soon as
possible,'' Eade said. ``I didn't see one instance of a citizen
that didn't cooperate.''
   ``West Oakland has a bad image as a dope haven, but there was a
lot of community effort,'' said Richard Reynolds, a car repair shop
owner who directed traffic for four hours with flares provided by
grateful police. ``This community came through.''
   William McElroy, a boilermaker, saw the community leap into
action as soon as the earthquake struck.
   ``The neighborhood people all came out to help, so we said, `Go
back into your houses and get ladders, wire cutters, tools,
flashlights, whatever you can find, and meet back here in 20
minutes,''' the 52-year-old McElroy said.
   The group managed to get forklifts and tore down a cyclone fence
to position the machinery under the freeway. Others went into a
nearby factory to get ladders and lumber, while still others
brought small hydraulic jacks they used to lift mangled cars.
   McElroy estimated they evacuated 40 to 50 people off the
highway. Twenty-one were injured and had to be taken off on gurneys.
   Reynolds said the community where former Black Panther leader
Huey Newton was slain recently has suffered from a bad reputation.
   ``They've got a lot of good people who are trapped here by their
drug problems. In general they are good responsible citizens,'' he
said.
   Kim Barnes, a janitor who lives a few blocks from the freeway,
spent all Wednesday at the scene after volunteering.
   ``After all you here about Oakland and its problems, a disaster
hits and boom you find out everybody's pulling together,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   China today called the selection of dissident
Fang Lizhi for the 1989 Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Human Rights
award a ``provocation against the Chinese people'' and ``wanton
interference'' in China's internal affairs.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, at a weekly briefing,
said the 53-year-old astrophysicist ``is a criminal wanted by the
Chinese public security organs'' and the award ``represents open
support to Fang Lizhi's criminal activities aimed at subverting the
legal Chinese government.''
   Li said: ``We express our utmost regret and strong indignation
at this fallacious decision.''
   Fang was China's best-known and most eloquent advocate of
democratic reform before the June military crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement silenced all dissent.
   Shortly after the military shot their way to student-occupied
Tiananmen Square on June 3-4, Fang and his wife, physicist and
political activist Li Shuxian, sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy,
where they remain today.
   Although Fang and his wife did not take an active role in the
student movement this spring, the government has accused them of
inciting counterrevolution and demanded that the United States turn
them over to police.
   The award, announced in Washington on Wednesday, honored Fang
for ``his commitment to speaking out against injustice and tyranny
at grave personal risk.''

   The soil conditions, land-use patterns and
construction quality of an area often have more bearing on the
deadliness of an earthquake than the proximity of the quake's
epicenter.
   That lesson was demonstrated again during the catastrophic quake
that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday with a magnitude of
6.9 on the Richter scale, geologists and engineers said Wednesday.
   The Oakland freeway that collapsed, killing an estimated 250
people, was 50 miles from the center of the quake. By contrast,
some places just a few miles from the epicenter were hardly scathed.
   Damage was relatively light and casualties were few in San Jose,
only 18 miles north of the center. And in Santa Cruz, a scant 10
miles south of the epicenter, only a few deaths were reported
despite extensive damage.
   ``Santa Cruz experienced the kind of damage it did because it
was in the earthquake epicentral area,'' said Ronald Scott, a civil
engineering professor at the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena.
   ``But there isn't a big Nimitz Freeway running through Santa
Cruz. The biggest concentration of large structures is around San
Francisco.''
   Tuesday's quake was the same magnitude as the quake that ravaged
Soviet Armenia last December. The Armenian quake killed at least
25,000 people _ more than 90 times the number of deaths reported in
the Bay area by early today.
   The major difference in toll is a result of better design and
construction in California, U.S. Geological Survey officials said.
   Generally, the intensity of ground shaking is strongest near the
epicenter, which explains why many buildings and roads collapsed in
Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Los Gatos and Hollister.
   San Jose may have escaped catastrophic damage because much of
the city sits on stream deposits somewhat firmer than bay mud and
fill, said geologist Douglas Hamilton, president of Earth Sciences
Associates, a Palo Alto consulting firm.
   But the severe damage to the freeway and the Marina district of
San Francisco, near the water's edge, ``seems to mainly be a
function of ground conditions: either artificially filled ground or
not very stable natural deposits around the margins of the bay,''
Hamilton said.
   The Nimitz Freeway _ built in 1957, a more primitive period of
earthquake design _ apparently rests on soft fill and bay mud,
which produces more of a rolling effect that goes on longer than
bedrock, which shakes at high frequencies _ short, sharp jolts,
Scott said.
   The catastrophic earthquakes centered on Mexico's Pacific coast
in 1985 caused the worst damage and most of the 4,000-plus deaths
in Mexico City, which rests on soft sediments of an old lakebed 250
miles from the epicenter.
   The change in seismic waves as they spread from a fault, along
with softer soils, give the waves longer vibration periods, Scott
said. That can make them more damaging to large structures _ such
as the Nimitz Freeway or the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge,
which had a 50-foot section collapse _ than to small ones.

<HEAD>Jurors Clear Two Oklahoma Lawmen Conspiracy Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHERMAN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury found two Oklahoma lawmen innocent
of charges they plotted to kidnap and torture a suspected drug
dealer to obtain evidence on drug laboratories.
   Jurors returned the verdicts Wednesday for Love County, Okla.,
Sheriff Wesley Liddell Jr. and his son-in-law, Roger Ray Hilton, a
Marietta, Okla., police officer.
   Liddell, who suspended himself after his arrest by FBI agents on
May 18, said he will return to work today.
   ``I just voluntarily unsuspended myself,'' said Liddell, 47.
   The officers were accused of conspiring to abduct Pearl
``Sonny'' Cornett and torture him to obtain evidence on drug
laboratories in southern Oklahoma and northern Texas.
   Oklahoma State Sen. Darryl Roberts, who represented Hilton, 27,
said several jurors had indicated to him they had felt all along
the government's case was weak.
   The trial ``was a circus from the very beginning. There was not
enough evidence,'' said juror Rebecca Ray.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney H.S. ``Bert'' Garcia said the jury's
verdict was ``based in part on the fact that in this case, no one
was tortured or hurt or harmed.''
   During the trial, defense lawyers claimed Liddell and Hilton
were framed by Marietta Police Lt. Tom Hankins, the prosecution's
lead witness. They said Hankins wanted Liddell's job. Hankins has
denied the claim.
   Hilton testified that the kidnapping plot was a hoax devised by
Liddell to see if Hankins would leak the information to drug
dealers.
   The FBI taped nine hours of conversations between the defendants
and Hankins through a wiring device attached to Hankins. The jury
heard a condensed three-hour version.

<HEAD>Alleged Elephant Thief Arrested in Texas, Will Return to New Jersey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An animal trainer who fled the state with
two elephants in 1984 said he will return to face charges following
his arrest in Texas.
   Arlan Seidon, 59, repossessed the elephants after a dispute with
two men who bought them from him. Seidon claimed the buyers
mistreated the animals and fell behind on their payments.
   ``I don't think I'm crazy,'' Seidon said Wednesday in an
interview from jail in Jefferson, Texas, broadcast on television
station WWOR in Secaucus. ``It's a very serious thing.''
   Seidon was arrested Tuesday on a fugitive warrant after one of
the men, Richard Drake, tracked him down. Drake has said he has
spent thousands of dollars searching for Seidon around the country.
   Seidon told WWOR he would not fight extradition back to Monmouth
County, N.J., where he faces charges of third-degree theft. If
convicted he would face up to five years in prison and a $100,000
fine.
   Seidon sold the Indian elephants, Tory and Duchess, to Drake's
son, Edward, in 1981 for $80,000. The Drakes owned a now-closed
exotic-animal ranch in Tehachapi, Calif.
   While the animals were on tour in New Jersey in 1984, Seidon had
a dispute with the Drakes and seized the elephants.
   Seidon said he decided to take the elephants back when the
Drakes fell behind in their payments. He also said that while
waiting for money from the Drakes at a New Jersey farm, he
discovered the animals had wounds from hooks used during training.
   The Drakes denied abusing the animals.
   A Monmouth County judge in May 1984 ordered Seidon to return the
7-foot-tall elephants. Instead, Seidon fled with them in a truck
and has hid them ever since.
   He pursued an appeal through telephone contacts with New Jersey
lawyer Isabelle Strauss, an animal-rights activist. But the state
appeals court rebuffed Seidon in January, saying he failed to show
the animals had been abused and provided no reason to believe the
court had erred in 1984.
   Seidon has said he raised the animals, now in their late 20s,
from their infancy. He told a newspaper in 1988 that he left his
Fordland, Mo., farm and his career preparing animals for circus and
television appearances to care for the elephants, which eat about
200 pounds of hay a day. He also said he hadn't seen his four
children or met his only grandson since he took off with the
animals.
   The elephants are in a barn in Texas. The Drakes are trying to
have them returned to New Jersey.

<HEAD>Thousands Storm Statehouse to Protest Education Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 15,000 people protested higher education
budget cuts in a demonstration that grew unruly when several
hundred students tried to enter the Statehouse and blocked an
entrance.
   Many students wore dunce caps that read ``State Skool,'' and
chanted ``No More Cuts!'' Many urged legislators to support new
taxes to pay for education.
   Capitol Police Capt. Dennis Sullivan said four were arrested:
two for assault and battery and two others for disorderly conduct.
   Sullivan said a window was broken and a drainpipe knocked down,
and officials estimated repairs could total $20,000.
   The higher education system, already strapped by earlier cuts,
faces an additional $25 million in trimming during the next round
of budget reductions.
   State Police Cpl. Joseph Howley estimated the number of
demonstrators to be 15,000.
   One person was removed from the House when he repeatedly yelled
down from the visitors' gallery to ask House Speaker George
Keverian if he intended to discuss the cuts.
   The Statehouse lawn's flower beds were trampled and more than
100 state, Boston, Capitol and Metropolitan District Commission
police closed the front entrances and patrolled the halls.
   From his chair, Keverian asked members to remain in the chamber,
called in police reinforcements and addressed a large gathering of
students outside.
   ``Everything that is being done here is not helpful and is in
fact disgraceful,'' he said. ``Trampling down doors, breaking the
law and breaking windows is not what we expect from our young
people and will not be helpful to you.''
   Higher Education Chancellor Franklyn Jenifer, Board of Regents
Chairman Paul Tsongas, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' education aide
Robert Schwartz, and others came to counsel the students to remain
orderly.
   Students swarmed over the Capitol steps, carrying signs that
read ``Stop Killing My College,'' and ``We want Mikey.'' One simply
read ``Arrrgh!'' Other students paraded with a coffin.
   The protesters began to disperse after they were informed their
buses were leaving, but one man made a dash for the House lobby
door. State police arrested him and pushed through the crowd to
take him away.
   About 200 students had gathered in front of Dukakis' office
earlier in the day and Schwartz spoke to the group.
   ``The fact of the matter is that we, with you, believe no more
cuts is exactly the right thing,'' Schwartz told them.
   The students were divided on whether to believe the
administration, and some loudly jeered Schwartz.
   ``No more lies!'' one young man yelled.
   Schwartz pressed on, telling the students they had to convince
legislators and voters that new taxes were needed to pay for higher
education and other state programs. ``This cannot be a one-day
rally,'' he said.
   Dukakis, who was out of the building throughout the afternoon,
said he was pleased by the students' show of solidarity, but not by
the rowdy behavior.

   In the midst of disaster, some companies
have stepped forward to offer free services to those in need, from
legal advice to fresh pasta.
   Lawyer Melvin Belli and his staff set up tables Wednesday
afternoon in front of his downtown offices, offering free legal
counsel to the public, said Marian Ashley, an employee at Belli's
Sacramento office.
   Ashley said Belli and his attorneys were not working out of
their office because the building was apparently unsafe.
   Bechtel Group Inc., one of the world's biggest engineering
companies, loaned the city of San Francisco the services of its
civil and structural engineers, said spokesman Larry Miller.
   ``This is our hometown and we'd like to help in whatever way we
can, and we thought this was the best way,'' said Miller. He said
similar assistance was also offered to Oakland and the state.
   Miller said Bechtel started trying to contact its estimated 200
engineers in the Bay area beginning Tuesday night. As of Wednesday,
25 to 30 were helping the city inspect buildings.
   He said more engineers would be offered to the municipalities as
they report in to San Francisco headquarters. The Bechtel office
was otherwise closed Wednesday.
   ``We have got a total of 1,500 projects going on in the world
... so the expertise here is pretty deep,'' said Miller. ``It's a
valuable commodity to have, and we are just happy to loan it to the
city.''
   Cellular One of Burlingame offered to lend free cellular phones
to any emergency service agencies that need them, according to
spokeswoman Carolyn Casey.
   The company, which also has an office in Oakland, has asked
individual customers to refrain from using the network to give
better access to relief workers.
   She said the company has more than 400 channels, with a capacity
to handle about 200,000 cellular phones.
   ``We've had over 500 phones go out our door, to emergency
agencies all over the Bay area,'' said Casey. ``We're doing
everything we can. We have people manning our system 24 hours a
day.''
   The Golden Gate Bridge on Wednesday did not charge a toll for
commuters from 6 a.m. to noon, in an effort ``to help alleviate the
flow of traffic, the traffic crunch that never happened,'' said
Bruce Selby, spokesman for the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway
Transportation District.
   The district anticipates much more traffic today because of the
closed Bay Bridge.
   People left hungry got some help from the Aunti Pasta retail
store chain. Every person who entered one of the eight Aunti Pasta
stores in the East Bay and San Francisco was offered one-third
pound of fresh pasta.
   ``We really want to help people out,'' said Julie Kramer,
manager of one store where at least 30 people in two hours had come
in to get pasta.
   ``I think we all want to help out in whatever way we can,'' said
Kramer. ``It's our little effort.''

<TEXT>
   More than 50 lawsuits have been filed
against the owner of a soft-drink delivery truck that ran a red
light and knocked a school bus into a water-filled pit last month,
killing 21 students and injuring 59.
   Families of victims, survivors and students who came to the
crash scene shortly after the Sept. 21 accident in Alton seek
unspecified damages from Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co. The truck's
driver also was named in some of the suits.
   The driver had told authorities the truck's brakes failed before
it struck the bus carrying Mission High School students, sending it
over a 40-foot cliff into a roadside pit. But the National
Transportation Safety Board concluded the truck's brakes worked
well enough to halt it at the stop sign.
   Some of the lawsuits accuse the company of ``conscious
indifference for the rights and well-being of the public.''
   A lawyer designated as spokesman for lawyers representing Valley
Coca-Cola was not in his office Wednesday and did not return a
phone call by The Associated Press.
   Families for at least 15 of the 21 dead students are represented
in the lawsuits. Other claims were filed on behalf of survivors,
and at least five were filed on behalf of students who said they
suffered mental anguish after arriving at the scene and seeing
their friends and relatives drowning.
   One suit states that ``Normalinda Perez was at the scene of the
accident in question and observed the bus under the water in the
pit as her daughter, Veronica Perez, still trapped in the bus,
drowned.''
   Most of the cases are consolidated in 275th District Court in
Edinburg; others have been filed in three of the other state
district courts in Hidalgo County, where Alton, 15 miles from the
Mexico border, is located.
   One survivor's family accused a lawyer of trying to bribe them
with $700 to keep him on their case. The family of 12-year-old Nora
Manriquez, which hired San Antonio lawyer Roberto Guerra on Oct. 4
but chose to hire another lawyer Oct. 9, last week filed for a
temporary restraining order to prevent Guerra from contacting them.
   Guerra said Wednesday the $700 was a loan the Manriquez family
had asked him to provide, and he speculated they were unhappy
because he did so a day late.
   ``If that's what they are calling a bribe, well you know I hope
my side gets heard,'' Guerra said. ``It's a lot more sensational to
say an attorney offered a bribe to pursue a fat case than to say he
honored a commitment on an advance.'' No ruling has been issued on
the restraining order.

<HEAD>Insurer of Oil Spilled in R.I. Sues Ship Owner</HEAD>

   The owners of the tanker that spilled
hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil in Rhode Island Sound this
summer were sued for $500,000 by the company that insured the
ship's cargo.
   The lawsuit Americas Insurance Co. filed Wednesday in U.S.
District Court against Ballard Shipping Co. asks that the tanker
World Prodigy be sold to pay its claim.
   However, attorneys for both sides said Ballard Shipping has
promised to pay any claims, making seizure of the vessel
unnecessary.
   The World Prodigy hit a reef a mile south of Newport on June 23,
tearing two gashes in its hull. The Coast Guard estimated 289,000
gallons of heating oil were spilled.
   The lawsuit alleges that the tanker was unseaworthy, its
officers and crew were ``incompetent or unqualified'' and the ship
was improperly and inadequately crewed, equipped and prepared for
sea.
   Americas Insurance estimated it will have to pay $500,000 in
claims for oil that was not delivered or was delivered mixed with
seawater.
   Ballard attorney Thomas H. Walsh said he had not seen the
lawsuit. He said he was puzzled the insurer would sue before trying
to settle its claim out of court.
   Ballard had promised to pay any claims against the ship in order
to allow the vessel to leave the country, Walsh said. The ship went
abroad for permanent repairs.
   In addition to Ballard, the lawsuit names International Maritime
Agencies Co. as a defendant. Stephen V. Rible, a New York attorney
representing Americas Insurance, said he believed that company was
Ballard's agent for operating the ship.
   After the accident, Ballard and ship's captain Iakovos Georgudis
pleaded guilty to violating the federal Clean Water Act, and
Georgudis pleaded no contest to a state pollution charge. Ballard
paid a $500,000 fine. Georgudis was fined $30,500.
   A group of fishermen have sued Ballard and Georgudis for $40
million in damages.

   Dozens of residents were stranded in remote
hollows as floods from the remnants of Hurricane Jerry wiped out
bridges and roads in eastern Kentucky, and officials feared more
rain could trigger flash floods.
   But in West Virginia on Wednesday, the high waters eased
hostility at least momentarily in the bitter United Mine Workers
coal strike: Strikers rescued three non-union coal company workers
whose van slid into a flooding creek.
   ``We really hate these guys, but we couldn't let them die,''
striking miner James Justice said Wednesday.
   Up to an inch of rain was expected in southeastern Kentucky
early today, renewing a flash-flood watch, the National Weather
Service said.
   In West Virginia, a half-inch fell Wednesday night, causing
flooding warnings for Mingo and Logan counties. The weather service
issued flash-flood watches today for 12 southern and eastern
counties.
   In both states, state disaster assessment teams toured flooded
areas on Wednesday and found hundreds of residents with homes
damaged by the flood, and many without safe drinking water.
   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton visited hard-hit areas by car
after foul weather grounded his helicopter.
   In Davin, the governor found a man with mud in his home, garage
and furnace.
   ``I had been up deer hunting in Roane County and my wife called
and said the water was coming up,'' Bruce Belcher told him.
   In eastern Kentucky's Pike County, several hundred homes were
flooded, numerous bridges were washed out and 1,000 families
without drinking water, said Johnny Mike Blair, the county's
disaster and emergency services coordinator.
   Drinking water was to be distributed today.
   Pike County was one of seven counties that declared emergencies
and requested state aid after Tuesday's flood.
   Eighty percent of the roads and bridges in Letcher County were
damaged by the flood, said county Judge-Executive Reuben Watts, who
estimated the repair cost at $1.5 million.
   ``We've still got quite a few places where people can't get to
their homes and can't get out,'' said Mike Watts, the judge's son.
   Water damaged the homes of 200 people in Clay County and
drinking water was being brought to residents in the Big Creek
area, said Joe Jones, a county disaster service coordinator.
   ``We spent the entire day yesterday trying to rescue people,''
he said.
   Clay, Floyd, Letcher, Perry, Pike, Leslie and Knott counties
requested state emergency assistance. Kentucky Gov. Wallace
Wilkinson was awaiting reports from state disaster survey crews
before formally requesting federal assistance.
   Wilkinson signed an executive order Tuesday to declare a state
of emergency.
   In the rescue by the striking miners, witnesses said about eight
UMW men jumped out of their cars to help the three non-union
workers, who were stuck in rising waters of Rum Creek at Dehue,
W.Va.
   One of the workers, Rodney Walker of Cincinnati, was trapped
with his foot pinned in the van, said state police Trooper Ric
Robinson.
   The UMW men held Walker's head above the rising water while
waiting for emergency workers to arrive, said state police Sgt.
G.A. Ables.
   ``Without a doubt, had they not helped, he'd have died,'' Ables
said.
   Justice, one of the rescuers, is a Pittston Coal Group employee
who has been on strike since April. ``We don't want to see anyone
killed over this,'' he said. ``We just don't want anybody taking
our jobs.''
   The three workers were treated at a hospital for cuts and
bruises and released.

<TEXT>
   Two Air Force security guards pleaded
guilty to stealing F-16 jet engines and selling them to undercover
FBI agents.
   Prosecutors said the airmen at Hill Air Force Base agreed to
sell Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-200 engines to FBI agents posing as
operators of a mock military surplus store.
   The arrests were part of Operation Punchout, a three-year
undercover investigation that eventually should result in charges
against more than 100 people, according to U.S. Attorney Dee Benson.
   The ``sting'' involving the Air Force, Pentagon and FBI, was
based out of a mock military surplus store in the town of Roy, 35
miles north of Salt Lake City.
   Airman 1st Class Brian David Roth, 22, of Chesterland, Ohio,
pleaded guilty Wednesday to five of 22 counts alleging theft of the
three engines and other military equipment from the northern Utah
base.
   Senior Airman Danny Joe Stroud, 24, of Newton, Kan., pleaded
guilty to one count of stealing the engines.
   The two, who authorities said began selling the stolen goods in
1987, were arrested July 10.
   Under the plea arrangement, another count charging Stroud with
the theft of $64,000 worth of computers and the remaining 17
charges against Roth are to be dropped when the pair are sentenced
Dec. 12.
   Stroud's wife, Kimberly, 22, also is charged with stealing the
engines but Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Lubeck said the charge
likely would be dropped.
   Benson said the men's sentences would depend in part on the
value of the engines, a matter that would be settled at an
evidentiary hearing.
   The penalty for each of the theft counts is up to 10 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Two sergeants have been acquitted of theft charges in
courts-martial, four other enlisted men are awaiting trial and
prosecutors are deciding whether another man will be tried, Hill
spokesman Len Barry said.
   Late last month, in another part of Operation Punchout, one Utah
man and three Californians were arrested on charges of conspiracy,
interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle and aiding and
abetting.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attackers early today bombed
the neighboring houses of Ruben Zamora and another prominent
leftist political leader, wounding two people.
   Zamora, a top leader of the Democratic Convergence, and Aronette
Diaz, vice-president of the Nationalist Democratic Union spoke with
journalists outside their heavily damaged homes shortly after the
1:15 a.m. attack.
   Mrs. Diaz blamed the army for the attacks.
   Zamora said his two bodyguards were wounded by the explosion of
a powerful bomb at his front door. Both were taken to the hospital,
though neither man appeared critically hurt, he said.
   Zamora returned to El Salvador in late 1987 after nearly eight
years of exile following the death squad slaying of his brother,
Mario.
   He is also a leader of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, which
is allied with leftist rebels waging a 10-year-old war against a
succession of U.S.-backed governments.
   Zamora, his wife and their five children were uninjured, though
shaken up, by the blast. The roof over the front rooms of the house
was destroyed, as were doors, drop ceilings and walls in four rooms.
   Two cars parked in a carport in front of the house were
destroyed.
   Mrs. Diaz, the widow of Mario Zamora, lives next door to Zamora
with her two sons. Three grenades exploded on her roof and right in
front of her house moments before the bomb went off at her
brother-in-law's door. Damage to the front rooms of her home was
also extensive.
   Zamora, 47, said the attack ``is intended to impede a political
solution to the war.'' But he refrained from directly blaming a
particular sector.
   Representatives of the government and the rebels on Wednesday
wound up three days of peace talks in Costa Rica. The talks
produced no substantive accord, but the two sides agreed to meet
again next month.
   ``This is the work of people in the army who don't want dialogue
and negotiation,'' said Mrs. Diaz, 43. ``They want to start another
spiral of violence like in 1980, when they killed my husband. Do
they want to bring more mourning to my home?''
   The government has urged the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, the rebel army, to stop fighting and join the political
process.
   ``Imagine, if this was done to us, who are not the FMLN, what
awaits the FMLN if they convert themselves into a political
party,'' said Mrs. Diaz. ``There are no guarantees for freedom of
poltical activity.''
   The bombing came two days after gunmen killed the 23-year -old
daughter of an army colonel. The government and armed forces blamed
the FMLN, which denied any responsibility in the slaying.

<HEAD>Generator Failures Force Jet Landing at Small Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTE VISTA, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both electrical generators failed on a
Northwest Airlines DC-9, forcing it to land at a small airport, an
investigator said. The darkened jet skidded about 1,000 feet off
the runway and into a muddy field.
   None of the 104 people aboard was seriously hurt in the
emergency landing at unattended Monte Vista Municipal Airport in
the mountains of southern Colorado early Wednesday.
   The cabin filled with smoke after the landing, and a crew member
had to use an ax to hack open a window and relieve cabin pressure
so the doors could open, Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen said.
   The pilot suffered minor cuts and bruises and one of the 99
passengers was treated at a hospital for shock and minor injuries,
officials said. Flight 109 had been flying from Minneapolis to
Phoenix.
   After landing, the pilot used a pay telephone to summon help.
   The jet's left generator apparently failed in flight late
Tuesday and the pilot tried unsuccessfully to start the auxiliary
power unit, said Bob Johnson, the National Transportation Safety
Board's regional director in Denver.
   The right generator failed soon afterward, Johnson said, and the
plane was left with battery backup power, which would have lasted
only 25 minutes.
   Passengers said there was no panic, even though the captain
could not talk with them over the intercom.
   ``We didn't have any warnings,'' said passenger Tina Borgmann,
24, of Waseca, Minn. ``All we were told is fasten our seatbelts and
put our trays in an upright position.''
   ``I just kept thinking, `What's next? Is this thing going to
catch fire?''' said Arlene Sevilla of Milwaukee, who held her
month-old daughter.
   ``Then we hit the ground and I just hugged my daughter closer
and thought, `Here we go.'''
   Passenger Todd Curtis, 28, of Thatcher, Ariz., said: ``When the
tires blew, the rims just sort of dug into the pavement and slowed
us down. I was afraid that we were going to start cartwheeling, but
the runway was apparently soft enough that the wheels just dug in.''
   The runway at Monte Vista is 6,000 feet long, Johnson said.
``Under ideal conditions that would be acceptable, but in an
emergency situation, it's marginal,'' the investigator said.
   Judy Sciola, a 49-year-old passenger from Edina, Minn., said
that after the plane landed, ``The pressure was just awful. The
little baby next to me was just screaming.''
   After the crew managed to open the door, the pilot found a pay
telephone to summon help.
   ``There we were in the middle of a field,'' Sciola said. ``We
wandered around these buildings and there was a pay phone. The
pilot called and said, `Excuse me, we've landed out here in this
field and we're going to need some emergency vehicles.'''
   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons would not release the pilot's
name, saying company policy prohibits releasing crew names unless
there is a fatality.
   ``Compliment that captain,'' Curtis said.
   Aside from the broken cabin window, the only apparent damage to
the plane was flat tires, said Johnson. Airline officials said they
did not immediately know the cause of the generator malfunction.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Legalize Opposition Parties In Further Move Toward Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament today legalized opposition
parties and banned political organizing in the workplace _ a
further move toward making a Western-style democracy of a country
under Communist rule for 41 years.
   Legislators voted to banish parties from the shop and factory
floor despite opposition from the ruling Socialist Party.
   At a congress last week that dissolved the Communist Party and
replaced it with the Socialist Party that embraced democracy,
delegates overwhelmingly approved a motion calling for the right to
organize party cells in the workplace.
   Under authoritarian Communist rule, such organizing has allowed
the ruling party to maintain political control over industry. It
was thus vigorously opposed by newly created opposition groups that
are preparing for Hungary's first free national elections since the
Communists consolidated power in 1948.
   The law passed today also seeks to define what the Socialist
Party owns by drawing the line between legally acquired funds and
property and other assets its Marxist-Leninist predecessor merely
control or may have seized illegally.
   The political opposition claims much of the party's wealth was
seized illegally after 1948.
   Under Communist rule, the party had controlled the government.
   At least in theory, the new law opens the way for people who
contend the government stole their property to seek its return.
   The Socialist Party, which claims to embrace democratic ideals
but remains in power at least until the national elections, agreed
Wednesday to discuss the disposal of some of its wealth with
Parliament and the government.
   Constitutional amendments laying down the right of political
parties ``to be freely established and ... (to) freely function''
were approved Wednesday.
   But the party law passed during a nationally televised session
today is more specific, formally outlining those rights as the
country prepares for next year's multiparty elections.
   Legislators approved some sections of the party law separately,
with 279 voting for a ban on parties at the workplace, 44 against,
and 12 abstaining.
   The section specifying Socialist Party assets was approved by
259 parliamentarians, with 44 against and 27 abstentions.
   Some present did not vote, accounting for the different totals.
   The bill is specifically geared to political parties wishing to
field candidates in the upcoming elections. It specifies, for
example, that no party may accept contributions from a foreign
state.
   Among other legislation enacted today was a law creating a
Supreme Court.
   On Wednesday, Parliament established the office of president of
the republic, who will replace the 21-man collective presidency.
But the parliament sidestepped a controversy over when and how the
president would be elected.
   The current arrangement calls for the president to be chosen in
a direct election for which Nov. 26 is the tentative date.
   Opposition forces are calling for a delay until after the
parliamentary elections that are to be held by June, and want the
new Parliament, where the opposition hopes for an overall majority,
to choose the president.
   The opposition fears the ruling party would be at an advantage
if the elections are held next month, that it will not have enough
time to organize an effective campaign.
   Parliament has not acted on a petition calling for a referendum
on when to hold the election.

   A painting by Henri Matisse was auctioned for
$12.4 million, a record for the artist, Sotheby's says.
   ``Woman with a Red Umbrella'' was sold to an anonymous buyer,
said Sotheby's spokesman Matthew Weigman.
   The Wednesday night sale of paintings and one Edgar Degas
sculpture was the first installment of the collection of the late
John T. Dorrance Jr., former chairman of Campbell Soup Co. and son
of its founder, Weigman said.
   The first installment alone set a record for a single owner's
collection at auction, bringing $116 million for 44 lots, he said.
   Records also were set for three other artists: Sir Edward Henry
Landseer, Theo van Rysselberghe and Edouard Vuillard, Weigman said.
   Other highlights of the sale included an American private
collector's purchase of Claude Monet ``Grainstacks'' for $8.5
million, and Japanese dealer Aska International's purchase of Pablo
Picasso's ``Au Moulin Rouge'' for $8.3 million and Vincent Van
Gogh's ``Man is at Sea'' for $7.2 million.
   The sale is to continue for the next three days, with 850 more
lots of paintings, furniture, silver and porcelain being offered.

<HEAD>Boeing Machinists Hold Out for Better Offer as Talks Break Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Boeing Machinists say the aerospace
giant's latest offer is no better than the contract they rejected
before walking out Oct. 4, and they're holding out for a better
economic package.
   The first post-walkout talks between Boeing Co. and
representatives of 58,700 workers in the International Association
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union fizzled Wednesday just
four hours after they began.
   Through a federal mediator, Boeing negotiators told the union
they would not expand the economic package union members rejected
Oct. 3, but were willing ``to make adjustments within the framework
of the original wage offer,'' the company said in a statement.
   ``They might be willing to move the numbers around a little bit,
but that's not what it's all about,'' said Tom Baker, president of
IAM District Lodge 751. ``It's about improvement.''
   Any further talks will be scheduled by federal mediator Douglas
Hammond. He said he will maintain contact with both sides daily,
but he held out little hope for an immediate resolution.
   ``If the parties continue to agree to disagree there's nothing I
can do about it,'' Hammond said.
   The talks were the first since Oct. 2, two days before IAM
members struck to press for a bigger share of Boeing's record
profits.
   Boeing chief negotiator Larry McKean on Wednesday defended the
company's wage offer as fair, equitable and the best three-year
offer in recent American industry history.
   The Machinists voted 85 percent to strike rather than take a
contract with annual wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3
percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3
percent the second; cost-of-living boosts virtually matching
inflation; a cut in mandatory overtime to 160 hours a quarter from
200 hours; and higher benefits.
   Baker said Boeing's unwillingness to budge didn't surprise the
strikers and he viewed the brief meeting as just a start.
   ``We'll take it a day at a time,'' he said, adding he planned to
join the picket line today. ``That's where the fight will be won,
on the picket line.''
   Rather than rush to a settlement, Baker added, union negotiators
planned to move cautiously to avoid a second rejection vote that
could leave both sides more entrenched.
   The Machinists represent 43,300 Boeing workers in the Puget
Sound area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a
few hundred others at scattered sites in California, Hawaii,
Montana, Utah and other states.
   For Boeing, there have been growing reports of concern about
delayed aircraft deliveries to Malaysia Airlines, America West
Airlines and British Airways. Boeing has delivered seven planes
during the strike.
   An agreement would set a pattern for other labor negotiations at
Boeing, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, and
traditionally sets the standard for the nation's aerospace industry.

<TEXT>
   Ingersoll Publications Co. has announced
the appointment of a new president and executive vice president.
   Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Princeton-based company, said this week that Robert M. Jelenic is
taking over the jobs of president and chief operating officer.
   Jean B. Clifton will become executive vice president, treasurer
and chief financial officer.
   Ingersoll, 43, will take on the additional responsibilities of
editor-in-chief of the company. He succeeds John Wilpers, who the
company said resigned to pursue other interests in his hometown of
Boston.
   The job of president had been vacant for a year, with Ingersoll
serving as acting president.
   Jelenic, 39, of Lawrenceville, N.J., joined Ingersoll
Publications in 1988 as executive vice president for operations. He
was involved in the start-up of The St. Louis Sun, which began
publishing last month, and will continue as president and chief
executive officer of the St. Louis Sun Publishing Co., Ingersoll
said.
   Ms. Clifton, 28, of Yardley, Pa., succeeds Michael A. Appelbaum,
who resigned last week. She began at Ingersoll in 1987 as executive
financial assistant in charge of financing projects in the United
States and Britain.
   Ingersoll Publications has more than 40 daily and 200 non-daily
newspapers in the United States and Europe. The privately held
company has more than 11,000 employees and has said its 1989 sales
will exceed $800 million.

   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said
today that it will open 100 toll-free telephone lines for
earthquake disaster victims in California.
   The telephone lines will allow disaster victims to make requests
from FEMA for emergency needs, such as housing, money or food.
   Gregg Chappell, FEMA's associate director, said inspectors will
visit disaster victims after receiving their calls for help. The
telephone lines are a stopgap measure until FEMA opens disaster
application offices in seven California counties, he said.
   ``This is a way to get in front of the process,'' he said.
   The telephone number is 1-800-4629029. The hundred telephone
lines will be open 24 hours a day, starting at 10 a.m. EDT.

   President Bush said today he will visit
Northern California on Friday to get a first-hand look at
earthquake damage and ``to provide encouragement'' to victims.
   ``We will stay on top of it,'' the president vowed.
   He announced his travel plans at a picture-taking session in the
Oval Office as he met with Vice President Dan Quayle and
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, just back from their
own inspection tour of the stricken San Francisco Bay area.
   White House aides said Bush would spend about three hours in the
bay area.
   The visit will include a helicopter survey of the affected areas
and the president will also meet with local officials, said
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   The president cited an ``all-out federal effort'' in responding
to the earthquake.
   ``Our hearts go out to the victims of this disaster and I will
be going out there tomorrow to take a look and to provide
encouragement to people,'' the president said.
   He voiced special praise for the Red Cross and other volunteer
efforts, saying: ``Thank God for the volunteers.''
   He said volunteers helping in the earthquake effort exemplified
what he meant in various speeches by ``a thousand points of light.''
   Bush thanked Quayle and Skinner for visiting the stricken area.
The president also said he had spoken by phone Wednesday night with
California Gov. George Deukmejian, who the president said expressed
satisfaction with federal efforts.
   He praised volunteer organizations for responding with ``this
concern for their neighbors that just exemplifies the volunteer
concept.''
   Bush said the visit by Quayle and Skinner ``did signal very much
of a concern on the part of the federal government.''
   ``We will stay on top of it. We will be in touch with the state
officials who in turn are dealing with the local officials
there...We're doing what we should do,'' Bush said.
   He said that ``there was a preparation here that was very, very
sound,'' noting earthquake simulation exercises conducted by the
Federal Emergency Management Ageny last August.
   Asked by Bush in front of reporters and cameras to give his own
evaluation of the situation, Quayle said: ``I think volunteerism
and preparation are the two important lessons.''
   Skinner told Bush that, as far as he could determine, there were
no outstanding requests from California state or local officials
that weren't currently being met by the federal governmemnt.
   As he met with the officials, the president held in his lap
several Bay area newsapers, topped by a San Jose Mercury with the
huge headline: ``MASSIVE QUAKE.''
   The president, whose administration came under criticism from
Congress and local officials for not responding faster when
Hurricane Hugo devastated South Carolina last month, has been
making forceful promises over the past two days of federal aid to
earthquake victims.
   On Wednesdsay, he declared his administration will ``take every
step and make every effort'' to aid the San Francisco area.

   Three strong aftershocks rattled Northern
California today as relief poured into the earthquake-devastated
Bay area from throughout the world.
   Workers dug into a 1\-mile-long slab of collapsed freeway in
Oakland with fading hopes that anyone might be alive. Authorities
fear more than 270 people were killed, most in the highway cave-in.
   There were signs of life slowly returning to normal. Power was
restored in the city's Financial District early this morning,
setting off thousands of alarms. Airports were open, and ferries
from Southern California steamed north to bolster the overburdened
Bay area commuter fleet.
   The third game of the World Series, which was within minutes of
the opening pitch when the quake struck, was rescheduled for
Tuesday at Candlestick Park in San Francisco.
   Still, many offices remained closed. The Bay Bridge, the
lifeline that links Oakland and San Francisco, was expected to be
closed at least one or two more weeks while a collapsed section is
repaired.
   An aftershock that measured 5.0 on the Richter scale of ground
motion struck at 3:15 a.m. and was centered near Watsonville, 10
miles south of Santa Cruz, according to the state Office of
Emergency Services.
   ``It was real strong,'' said Kelly Johnston, an admitting clerk
at AMI Community Hospital in Santa Cruz. ``I ran to the doorway.
Most people were just standing there frozen.''
   ``No one is really sleeping around here,'' Watsonville resident
John Murphy said.
   Two other aftershocks measured 4.5. The aftershocks collapsed
the damaged steeple of a Watsonville church, and further damaged
buildings in Santa Cruz, near the epicenter of Tuesday's 6.9 quake,
state officials said.
   As of early today, more than 1,400 aftershocks were recorded.
The strongest, 5.2 on the Richter scale, struck within 40 minutes
of initial jolt, according the U.S. Geological Survey.
   On Wednesday, BART, the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system,
reopened and then closed again when a train operator reported a
leak in the tube beneath the bay.
   Gov. George Deukmejian demanded an investigation into the
collapse of Interstate 880 in Oakland, saying it should have been
built to withstand the devastating force of Tuesday's earthquake.
   The collapse ``raises troubling questions for the entire state
in terms of the construction of our freeways,'' Oakland Mayor
Lionel Wilson said.
   Largely because of the collapse of I-880, known as the Nimitz
Freeway, the quake was the second-deadliest in U.S. history. It
killed an estimated 270 people _ 250 of them in the rubble of the
Nimitz _ and crippled transportation, electric power and commerce
in the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan area, a region of more
than 6 million people.
   Besides the commuters crushed in the freeway collapse, at least
21 people died in San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa
Cruz counties. State officials said 1,400 people were injured
throughout the Bay area, although hospitals said they treated 2,750
people, many for chest pains.
   In Santa Cruz, closest to the quake's epicenter, police arrested
at least five people Wednesday night after distraught friends of a
woman missing in the rubble marched to protest authorities'
decision to stop searching for her. Several buildings in the city's
historic downtown district were destroyed.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos said the quake caused $2 billion
worth of destruction in his city alone.
   President Bush, sharply criticized in South Carolina for his
response to Hurricane Hugo, quickly declared the San Francisco
region a disaster area and directed an initial $273 million in
relief efforts. White House officials said he would tour the area
Friday.
   More relief began to flow in from places as far afield as South
Carolina, Japan and Great Britain. Israel and France offered to
send disaster teams experienced in finding victims trapped beneath
wreckage.
   Officials in Los Alamos, N.M., dispatched a device used to
locate survivors of last year's earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   Hope was fading, however, that anyone would be found alive
beneath the devastation in San Francisco's Marina district or under
the crushing weight of I-880.
   In the affluent Marina district, two bodies were spotted in the
rubble of a four-story apartment building. Their hands were
clutched in an embrace, said Dr. Charles Saunders of the city
Health Department.
   ``There were no signs of life,'' he said. ``It's very unlikely
anyone else will be found alive.''
   Across San Francisco Bay in Oakland, crews searched round the
clock for victims amid the tons of steel and concrete that had been
the Nimitz Freeway.
   ``We have located several individuals, none of whom are alive so
there are no survivors at this point,'' Oakland police Capt. Jim
Hahn said.
   Earlier, rescuers freed a 6-year-old from a car by cutting
through the body of his dead mother. The boy was in critical
condition.
   Seven bodies were recovered from the Nimitz and police said at
least 86 people were officially reported missing. The quake hit at
rush hour, and state officials estimated there were 250 cars caught
in the collapse, based on an optimistic assumption of one person
per car.
   A remote-control backhoe was flown in by helicopter to dig out
the rubble, but couldn't begin operation until workers shored up
the 1\-mile stretch of collapsed roadway.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., got an overhead view of the
crushed freeway from a helicopter and offered a horrific
description: ``It looked like a snake hacked with an ax. It was in
bits and pieces.''
   The Nimitz, built in the 1950s, was reinforced in 1977 in the
first of a three-phase program to earthquake-proof state highways.
   The second phase, begun on other roads in the last year, had
been delayed at the Nimitz pending an engineering study, according
to Bill Schaefer, the chief engineer for the California Department
of Transportation.
   Still, Schaefer said he was shocked by the collapse. ``We
thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake we could
have in this area,'' he said.
   Deukmejian said the cave-in appeared to be the result of
substandard construction. ``I think ... we should have a full
inquiry to determine why there were failures,'' Deukmejian said.

   The federal government is spending 40 percent
less on reducing earthquake hazards than it spent a decade ago even
though scientists predict more major temblors, not only in
California but in the South and Northeast.
   ``We've had essentially no funding for several years,'' Rep.
Doug Walgren, D-Pa., said Wednesday. ``It's hard for the public and
government to be serious about something that may or may not happen
next year.''
   President Bush asked Congress this year to cut $3.1 million _ or
about 5 percent _ from the earthquake research and emergency
preparedness programs of four key agencies.
   U.S. Geological Survey experts told the House subcommittee n
science, research and technology that Tuesday's quake in the San
Francisco Bay region raises their concerns another one of similar
size will occur closer to the city _ but not in the near future.
   ``We're talking about decades rather than days or weeks,'' said
Robert Wesson of the USGS. ``It might be slightly more likely we
could have an earthquake along the fault but in an area to the
north.''
   But Wesson said he doubts the Bay area faces an earthquake that
would rival the 1906 San Francisco quake, which experts calculated
at an 8.3 magnitude on the later-developed Richter scale.
   ``I don't think we expect a magnitude 8 earthquake in the San
Francisco area,'' he said.
   Tuesday's quake registered a 6.9 on the Richter scale, close to
the power of last December's earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   The USGS had warned the House subcommittee in June to expect an
earthquake of least 6.5 magnitude in the San Francisco area in the
next 30 years.
   Other officials have said areas alog active faults in the East
also may face a quake greater than 7 magnitude in the next 20
years. They said Charleston, S.C.; Buffalo, N.Y., and Memphis,
Tenn., are possible sites.
   Meanwhile, a draft presidential executive order prepared by an
interagency task force to improve the safety of federal buildings
in quake-prone areas has languished in the White House's budget
office since 1986.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., blames inertia in Congress and the
Reagan and Bush administrations for a failure to earthquake
response capabilities even though the technology is readily
available.
   ``It's partly the case of not thinking about fixing the roof
until it's raining, and then not fixing it because it is raining,''
Gore said Wednesday.
   Congress in 1977 established the National Earthquake Reductions
Hazard Program to coordinate research into quakes and improve
preparedness.
   But annual federal spending on the effort has dropped from $94.4
million to less than $66 million in fiscal 1989. This year, Bush
asked Congress to cut the program to $62.9 million.
   As a result, according to the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee, regional seismic networks covering the
central and eastern states have been cut back sharply along with
programs to develop safer buildings, roads and highways.
   Supporters of the program also say the Federal Emergency
Management Agency has been languid in carrying out its designated
lead role for implementing the 1977 law.
   The agency coordinates its quake-related activities with the
Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology.
   A committee of outside experts appointed by FEMA concluded in
1987 that FEMA's performance was ``unacceptable.'' It recommended
switching the leadership role to the USGS but also called for
tripling _ to $199 million annually _ what the government spends on
earthquake preparedness.
   That panel said much of its recommended increase should go
toward developing supercomputers that might enable scientists to
better predict when and where earthquakes will occur and enhance
emergency response capabilities.

   Saudi Arabia's foreign minister met with
President Hafez Assad today to work out a plan for the withdrawal
of Syrian troops from Lebanon as part of a settlement of that
nation's civil war.
   In Taif, Saudi Arabia, sources at the meeting of the Lebanese
parliament said the Saudi government also was trying to satisfy
Christian demands for withdrawing Syria's 40,000 troops withdraw
from Lebanon.
   In Beirut, an aide to Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun today
urged Christian lawmakers to leave the conference if there is no
agreement by Friday.
   ``We demand clear guarantees that the Syrians would withdraw,''
said Farouk Abillama, secretary general of Aoun's Foreign Ministry
and one of the general's closest advisers.
   Abillama, after a meeting with the Christian leader, told
reporters that Maronite Christian parliamentary deputies have
agreed to political reform that would shift some power to the
Moslems.
   ``So let them give us something in return,'' he said. The
Christian deputies ``should return in 24 hours if they fail to
reach agreement,'' he said at midday.
   Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saudi
Foreign Minister Prince Saud arrived unexpectedly in Damascus late
Wednesday carrying a letter from King Fahd on the issue.
   Presidential spokesman Jibrane Kourieh said Syrian Vice
President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
also attended the meeting.
   Saud was expected to meet with Lebanese Christians in Taif later
today to discuss results of the trip.
   The Lebanese parliament has been meeting in Taif under the
auspices of the Arab League for the past 20 days to try to settle
that nation's 14-year-old civil war.
   Talks have been at a standstill for days over the Christians'
call for guarantees that the Syrians will withdraw.
   The Syrians have been in Lebanon since 1976 under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate and have become the main power brokers in the
country.
   The Christians, led by Aoun, charge that Damascus violated its
mandate by siding with the Moslems and have declared a ``war of
liberation'' against the Syrians.
   Conference sources said Saud has advised the Christians that the
guarantees they seek would be contained in amendments to a peace
accord.
   They also said Syria's agreement to the proposed amendments
would cool opposition from Lebanon's Moslem lawmakers and allow the
Taif conference to move ahead to discussion of a new power-sharing
agreement.
   The 33 Christian and 30 Moslem lawmakers have agreed to
political reforms that would give some of the power of the
traditionally dominant Christians to Moslems.
   But Aoun has insisted that without guarantees of a Syrian
pullout a peace settlement cannot be completed. Any peace accord
worked out in Taif must be approved by the militia commanders in
Lebanon.
   An Arab League mediating committee of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and
Algeria has proposed a two-year phased withdrawal of the Syrians
from the Beirut area.
   The troops would be redeployed in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley
until a strong central government were established and the nation
signed a security pact with Syria.
   Aoun, however, has insisted that Syrian troops begin leaving
Lebanon as soon a charter for national reconciliation is ratified
by a parliamentiary session in Beirut.

   Authorities searching for missing
transients have continued digging at a farm where they found the
bodies of three unidentified men buried in a barn.
   Members of a police task force formed last week used a backhoe
Wednesday around a well between a farmhouse and the barn where the
bodies were found Monday in shallow graves.
   Investigators searched two other sites in the Livingston County,
northeast of Kansas City, but would not say exactly where.
   Sheriff's deputies began digging last week at the 40-acre farm
of Ray and Faye Copeland after arresting the couple Oct. 9 and
charging them with conspiracy to steal in an alleged cattle swindle.
   The bodies were found on another farm about 12 miles south of
the Copeland home. Neil Bryan, owner of the farm, said the
75-year-old Copeland had worked for him doing odd jobs for 20 years.
   A man who said he rented the farm until about a week ago, John
Hovey, said Copeland warned him and his four children to stay out
of the barn.
   Asked if he noticed anything, Hovey said: ``Just the stench. It
stunk in the barn. I thought an animal had crawled in there and
died.''
   Authorities declined to say if the Copelands were murder
suspects. No charges have been filed except the conspiracy to steal
charge, but the squad has said that the search was for several
missing transients who have worked for them.
   Bryan is not a suspect, authorities said.
   The charge against the Copelands alleges they bought cattle with
a check that bounced, then sold the cattle without making good on
the check.
   Copeland and his 68-year-old wife remained in jail on bonds of
$25,000 each.

<HEAD>Judges Turn Down Suspected Terrorist's Release Plea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court today refused to release
a Palestinian wanted in the United States for the fatal 1982
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Hawaii.
   The three-member council that rules on requests for the
temporary release of people held in pretrial custody said that it
had no jurisdiction over the matter because Mohammed Rashid's
extradition was in the hands of the justice minister.
   American officials have said Rashid's case is a test of Greece's
willingness to fight terrorism.
   Rashid, 39, has been held by Greece since his arrest on a false
passport charge in May 1988. The Supreme Court last May upheld a
U.S. request for his extradition but also said the final decision
rests with the justice minister.
   The Greek government put the matter on hold after the June
elections, when the country was ruled by a conservative-Communist
coalition. The present caretaker government has a mandate only to
lead the nation to elections on Nov. 5 and will not make any
foreign policy decisions, such as one on Rashid's extradition.
   The Palestinian is accused of planting a bomb on a Pan Am jumbo
jet in 1982. A Japanese teenager was killed and 15 other people
injured in the blast over Hawaii.
   On Sept. 14, Rashid asked a public prosecutor to present his
case to the appeals court council, saying that his continued
detention after the Supreme Court ruling ``stretches out my
detention indefinitely, thus violating basic human rights.''
   Rashid was first held for entering Greece on a false passport.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization claims that Rashid is one
of its members and that he is the victim of a conspiracy intended
to present Palestinians as terrorists.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet interior minister today branded Boris
N. Yeltsin a liar and defended a government investigation into an
alleged assassination attempt of the maverick lawmaker.
   The comments by minister Vadim Bakatin came less than 24 hours
after Yeltsin accused President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of staging a
``political farce'' in an attempt to scuttle Yeltsin's political
career.
   Bakatin maintains that Yeltsin appeared at a police post Sept.
28, dripping wet, and reported that men had assaulted him and
thrown him off a bridge into the Moscow River. Yeltsin, however,
told the Supreme Soviet legislature this week he never reported
such an incident and that no such attack occurred.
   ``I have presented only the official information I had from the
policeman. I stated only what comrade Yeltsin told the policeman,''
Bakatin told reporters at a news conference called especially to
discuss the affair.
   The interior minister's appearance before reporters showed the
government was eager to deflect Yeltsin's accusations quickly.
   Bakatin said Yeltsin ``lied publicly'' when he told his story to
the Supreme Soviet in remarks later shown on nationwide television,
and a second time a day later when he issued a statement to the
press accusing Gorbachev trying to undermine him.
   ``In my view this is becoming particular to comrade Yeltsin _
saying something then afterwards calling it persecution,'' Bakatin
said.
   He also accused Yeltsin of making a false report when he arrived
at the police station.
   ``There was no attempt on his life,'' the minister said. ``These
rumors are false.''
   Yeltsin denied making a formal report of an assassination
attempt but has not addressed whether he appeared at a police post
soaking wet.
   In the statement to the Supreme Soviet, Yeltsin called the
affair ``a new attempt to ruin my health and to knock me out of the
sphere of political struggle.''
   Gorbachev had brought Yeltsin into the leadership but had him
fired in 1987 for criticizing the slow pace of reforms. He has
gradually made a political comeback, winning 89 percent of the vote
in March to become a member of the new Soviet Congress.
   Bakatin said Yeltsin had recaptured a position in the government
because of his criticism of authorities, casting himself as a
victim and exploiting slogans popular with people.
   Asked if Yeltsin would be prosecuted on charges of filing a
false police report, Bakatin said there were no such plans.
Besides, he said, Yeltsin's status as a lawmaker means his fellow
legislators would have to sanction any criminal investigation
involving him.
   
   The interior minister defended Gorbachev's conduct in regard to
his former protege.
   ``Any non-partisan observer would see that the general secretary
of our party, comrade Gorbachev, has very loyally and correctly
reacted to the declaration or conduct of comrade Yeltsin,'' Bakatin
said.
   Bakatin also claimed Yelstin asked him in a telephone
conversation not to investigate the incident further but the
interior minister told reporters, ``I could not give this
promise.'' He maintained that contrary to what Yeltsin claimed in
his statement, the investigation had not ``touched on his private
life.''

   Some looting occurs, but disaster is far more
likely to bring out the best in people than the worst, say experts
on how people behave during calamities.
   ``Generally, overall criminal behavior drops off at the height
of the emergency,'' says Enrico Quarantelli of the Disaster
Research Center at the University of Delaware, commenting on
reports of scattered violence and looting in the aftermath of the
Northern California earthquake Tuesday.
   ``If you are an idiot before an earthquake, you're an idiot
after an earthquake,'' adds Russell Dynes, a sociologist at the
same research unit, but he agrees that ``the evidence in situations
like this is that looting is very minimal.''
   Looting and violence were also noticed in New York City on July
13-14, 1977, during a 25-hour power failure and in the Caribbean
and Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Hugo.
   St. Croix was the scene of reckless looting this fall, but that
was more an expression of political discontent than simple greed,
said psychiatrist Peter Steinglass of the George Washington
University School of Medicine, who does research on family
responses to natural disasters. ``Hugo was just an excuse to allow
an outpouring,'' he said.
   The earthquake in Armenia, too, triggered alienation toward the
Kremlin, accused of denying aid in retaliation for the area's
attempt to assert its independence from Moscow, Steinglass said.
   Paradoxically, he said, disasters become a rewarding memory to
those who survive them.
   ``Often people who have been through these experiences look back
upon them as events that had a very positive influence on their
lives,'' he said. The survivors are proud to have coped _ and
survived.
   Looting gets a bigger role in accounts of disasters than it
deserves, the experts say.
   ``There are lots of reports of it based on expectations,'' says
Dynes. ``If one looks at New York on any given night there are a
certain number of arrests and the question is whether those
incidents go up or down during disasters. By and large they go
down.''
   Psychologist Justin Schulz of Englewood, Colo., says television
exaggerates the looting that does occur: ``You see one angry face
smashing a car and it becomes something bigger in your own mind.''
   Thomas Courtless, a sociologist and law professor at George
Washington University, says what happens during a disaster is that
criminals take advantage of the special circumstances _ the police
are tied up in rescue work.
   ``I don't know when the stock market crashed whether this didn't
open some opportunities for some pretty sharp operators, too,''
Courtless says. ``What these situations have in common is the sense
that `I'm not going to get caught.'''
   Far more common in disasters than criminal behavior is heroism,
says Andrew Baum, a health psychologist at the Uniformed Services
University of the Health Sciences who has done research on people's
behavior in floods, tornadoes and other disasters.
   ``People help each other and engage in rescue attempts.
Disasters tend to bring out the more positive side of human
nature,'' he says.
   ``As far back as Roman times there have been accounts of people
looting and rioting,'' notes David Silber, a psychologist at George
Washington University.
   ``There's a theory called frustration-induced criminality _ the
idea that those people who are most likely to be avid looters and
to take advantage of social breakdown will be those who have the
least,'' he adds.
   On the other hand, notes Schulz, who is an expert on post-trauma
stress, ``thumbing your nose at the adult community'' is common
among all young men. The same phenomenon sends youths to Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., in the spring to get drunk and ``find a way to
break the rules.''

<TEXT>
   This week's earthquake didn't damage
just bridges and buildings. It ripped into a California Dream
already frayed by smog, crowding and soaring real estate costs.
   Experts have warned for years that the Bay area would be hit
someday by ``The Big One,'' a catastrophic earthquake they say will
be worse than Tuesday's quake. Even the telephone book has
instructions on what to do after an earthquake.
   The warnings have done little to slow a population explosion
fueled by California's famous sunny weather and a healthy economy.
   ``You hear about Californians being so blase about earthquakes.
Well, they have been,'' said Karen Anderson, a Berkeley native who
recently returned to the area after 10 years in Indiana.
   ``But this is different,'' she said. ``The weather's really nice
here, but something like this makes you question whether it's worth
it. I've thought about leaving this area because of the rising cost
of real estate and congestion. I guess this is one more reason.''
   If she goes, she'll be in the minority, said real estate agents.
The quake produced a temporary lull Wednesday in residential sales.
``People had other things on their minds,'' said Oakland real
estate agent Jon Shahoian.
   But he predicted sales will be brisk again by next week in this
overheated market, where a typical, three-bedroom house costs more
than $250,000.
   ``It's not as if people have been unaware of the potential for
earthquakes here,'' Shahoian said.
   Indeed, many Bay area residents seemed to be trying to live up
to the laid-back image of Californians in the quake's aftermath.
The order of the day in all but the hardest-hit zones was business
as usual.
   Even as rescue workers dug through rubble to look for quake
victims, tourists jockeyed for position to take snapshots of the
damage.
   And just a few miles from where a section of Interstate 880
collapsed, killing an estimated 250 people, few shoppers at a
Berkeley supermarket were stocking up on supplies in case an
aftershock should hit.
   Most of them were just buying dinner.
   ``You take it in stride,'' said Vera Hogan, whose purchases
included candles to light her apartment, which was still without
electricity Wednesday night.
   She needed the candles so she could see to clean up the broken
glass and dishes that the quake had jarred loose in her apartment.
And she was just getting to it Wednesday because the quake had
stranded her across the bay in San Francisco the night before.
   Still, she thinks California living is a breeze. ``It's better
here than in Louisiana, where I come from. There, you get
hurricanes, tornadoes _ and no opportunities, to boot.''
   Many who survived the earthquake with no injury or property
damage may take it as a sign that their lack of concern is
justified.
   Real estate agent Jean Sinel of Albany said she knows many
homeowners on the Hayward Fault _ a likely spot for earthquakes in
the Bay area _ who don't bother to spend the extra $200 a year for
quake insurance.
   They figure the gamble is worth the risk, she said.
   ``When was our last big one _ 1906?'' she asked, referring to
the catastrophic quake that killed hundreds or perhaps throusands.
   ``Natives don't seem to be as frightened as the
out-of-staters,'' she said. ``Earthquakes are something we live
with here.''

   Winter storm and freeze warnings were posted for today in
several states in the Midwest, and rain threatened to cause
additional flooding in Kentucky and West Virginia.
   Snow in the Ohio Valley snapped power lines and blacked out
thousands of customers across Ohio and closed some schools. Between
3 and 5 inches of snow fell overnight in Cincinnati, Dayton and
other areas of southwestern Ohio, according to the National Weather
Service. It was the earliest snowfall in Dayton since 1912.
   Snow also fell in parts of Indiana, with a dusting of flakes in
southern Michigan and a trace of snow in central Illinois.
   The snow in Ohio followed a drop in temperatures from the upper
70s and low 80s Monday and Tuesday into the upper 20s and low 30s
early today.
   On Wednesday, West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton toured the
flood-ravaged southern part of his state, saying he would make
low-interest aid available to residents hit by two days of high
water.
   The National Weather Service, meanwhile, issued a flood watch
through today, predicting more rain for 12 southeastern West
Virginia counties. The weather service also issued small stream and
urban flood warnings through early today in two counties.
   In two eastern Kentucky counties, dozens of residents remained
stranded in remote hollows after floods destroyed small bridges or
wiped out access roads.
   State disaster assessment teams toured flood-stricken areas in
four counties on Wednesday and found hundreds of residents with
homes damaged by the flood, and many without safe drinking water.
   Tennessee's temperatures were expected to tumble. A warning for
freezing temperatures tonight was posted in the state's western and
central parts.
   Alabama also was expected to be chilly. Forecasters said Mobile
could get a frost tonight, which would be its earliest on record.
   Freeze warnings also were posted for northwest Arkansas,
northwest Oklahoma, north-central Texas and parts of New Mexico.
   Rain, showers and thunderstorms lingered from the New England
coast across the Virginias, the Carolinas, Georgia, the Florida
Peninsula, northern Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, southern Illinois
and southern Indiana. Snowshowers were scattered in northeast
Illinois and northern lower Michigan.
   But in a few places, summer seemed to remain.
   High temperature records for the date Wednesday were set in
Alameda, Calif., with 84 degrees; Hollywood, Fla., 89; Key West,
Fla. 89; Miami, 90; and Moffett, Calif., 83.
   The nation's high Wednesday was 99 degrees in both Monrovia and
San Gabriel, Calif.

   A federal magistrate today ordered a
former Marine and Air Force communications officer held without
bail on charges he passed classified material to the Soviet Union.
   Magistrate W. Curtis Sewell said he found ``a preponderance of
evidence'' against Frank Nesbitt, 44, to send the case to a grand
jury.
   Nesbitt was arrested last week at a hotel in McLean, Va., by the
FBI and wss charged with delivering and attempting to deliver
unauthorized information to agents of the Soviet government.
   At today's hearing, FBI Special Agent Lizzie Cassell, who
related conversations she had with Nesbitt starting on Oct. 4.
   Ms. Cassell said Nesbitt came to the FBI office in Washington,
D.C., accompanied by an official from the U.S. Embassy in
Guatemala, to tell his story.
   According to the agent, Nesbitt left his home near Memphis,
Tenn., last June and began an odyssey that took him from Central
and South America to the Soviet Union and back to Guatemala.
   Ms. Cassell said Nesbitt told her he sought citizenship, housing
and a job in the Soviet Union. ``He stated to me he had defected,''
she testified.
   She said Nesbitt gave classified communications intelligence
information to the Soviets during his 10-day stay in Moscow and
also provided Soviet agents with diagrams and charts.
   Nesbitt's court-appointed attorney, Gregory English, said his
client believed the information that he passed on was unclassified.
He said Nesbitt also had broached the idea of working as a double
agent when he voluntarily went to the FBI.
   Nesbitt served from 1963 to 1966 in the Air Force's Electronic
Security Command in West Germany and from 1969 to 1979 in the
Marine Corps, where he dealt with classified
communication-gathering.
   He did not testify at today's court proceeding.

<UNK>Military Investigation Says Communist Rebels Killed Americans</UNK>
<DATELINE>SAN FERNANDO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military said an
investigation completed today proved Communist rebels were
responsible for killing two Americans the day Vice President Dan
Quayle arrived on a visit last month.
   The rebel New Peoples' Army has not claimed responsibility for
the Sept. 26 slaying of William H. Thompson, 45, and Donald G.
Buchner, 44, who were gunned down by six assailants who sprang from
a passenger jeep and opened fire on the victims' car near Capas in
Tarlac province.
   They were civilian technicians working for Ford Aerospace Corp.
at Camp O'Donnell, a U.S. military installation about 60 miles
north of Manila.
   ``We have established the Communist angle in the incident,''
Capt. Carlos Flores, deputy chief of the Criminal Investigation
Service in Central Luzon, told reporters.
   The regional command of the Philippine Constabulary said the
investigation's findings were based on captured rebel documents and
witness accounts, but Flores refused to release the report or give
details. He said he will submit the report to law enforcement
agencies.
   Flores said an assassination plan for the two Americans was
captured from two rebel leaders, including Danilo Cunanan, alleged
deputy commander of the rebel Mariano Garcia Brigade, who was
arrested Oct. 5 in San Fernando.
   Cunanan was killed soon after his arrest when he allegedly tried
to grab the rifle of his guard. His colleague escaped, fleeing with
his guard's weapon, the military said.
   Flores said initial results showed that fingerprints found in
the vehicles used in the killings included those of Noli Paniza,
alleged chief of the rebel brigade.He said the other assailants
were unknown.
   In April, rebels killed U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe as he
drove to work to the headquarters of the Joint U.S. Military
Assistance Group in suburban Quezon City.In October, 1987, rebels
killed three Americans in separate attacks outside Clark Air Base.
   Clark is among six military installations run by Americans under
an agreement with the Philippines, whose lease expires Sept. 1991.
   Marxist insurgents, who are waging a 20-year old rebellion, have
vowed to kill Americans involved in counter-insurgency. They have
also called for the closure of the bases and threatened to launch
more attacks.

<TEXT>
   A mother has been arrested on charges she
cut up her teen-age son with a shard of glass and rubbed salt in
the wounds to drive ``evil spirits'' from him, police said.
   Virginia Patterson Jenkins, 37, of Anderson, was charged with
assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature Monday. She
remained jailed today without bond.
   She was arrested after a neighbor reported that Ms. Jenkins'
14-year-old son, who was beaten and bleeding, sought refuge at his
house Monday night, said sheriff's Deputy Mike Temple.
   Temple said the boy had cuts all over his body from a piece of
broken mirror and salt was rubbed into his wounds. The boy also had
been forced to drink salt water, he said.
   ``This woman thought the boy was possessed and enlisted the help
of her 12-year-old son to exorcise it,'' Temple said. ``This is one
of the most bizarre cases I've ever seen.''
   The 12-year-old apparently helped hold his brother down during
the attack, said Sheriff's Capt. John Skipper.
   The 14-year-old was taken to Anderson Memorial Hospital, where
he spent Monday night, then was taken into protective custody and
placed in foster care along with his younger brother, Temple said.
Skipper said there were no other siblings and that the boys' father
did not live in the area.
   All the mirrors but one were broken in Ms. Jenkins' home and
deputies confiscated a bloody shower curtain, Temple said.

   Krenz, who took over from Erich Honecker on Wednesday, made it
clear in a speech that the Communist Party will resist
pro-democracy movements like those under way in Hungary and Poland.
   The change in leadership was praised in other East bloc
countries, but opposition leaders here said Krenz's style will not
end dissatisfaction that has caused street protests and driven tens
of tens of thousands of East Germans to flee West.
   Activists said today that about 1,000 people held a peaceful
protest in the northern city of Greifswald hours after Krenz was
named party chief. The protesters reportedly demanded democratic
reforms and the release of those detained during demonstrations
earlier in the month.
   Reinhardt Schultz, a co-founder of the New Forum opposition
group, said today, ``I don't think that the protest movement will
settle for a few cosmetic changes.''
   Another government critic, East German author Rolf Schneider,
told West Berlin's RIAS radio in an interview Wednesday: ``The
crisis will keep dragging on.''
   ``Egon Krenz doesn't enjoy any particular trust among the
people,'' said Baerbel Bohley, another New Forum leader. He blamed
the 52-year-old leader for unleashing police forces that attacked
pro-democracy demonstrators in East Berlin on Oct. 7 and Oct. 8.
   Communist Party sources have said Krenz ordered security forces
to use more restraint in later demonstrations.
   The Communist Party's Central Committee named Krenz to succeed
his hard-line mentor, 77-year-old Honecker, who ruled the nation 18
years. Krenz, the youngest member of the ruling Politburo, also
will assume the duties of head of state and head of the military,
replacing Honecker in all three roles.
   Honecker said he stepped down because of health reasons, but
rising public opposition to his authoritarian rule had fueled
pressure for his resignation.
   More than 53,000 East Germans have fled the West in recent weeks
via Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia. In Austria, authorities
said today that more than 1,000 East German refugees crossed from
Hungary into Austria since Wednesday morning. Most have gone on to
West Germany, where they are granted automatic citizenship.
   Addressing East Germans on television a few hours after his
elevation, Krenz said discussion of change is important and
promised the ruling party ``would initiate a new course.''
   But he stressed that ``without the Communist Party there would
be no German Democratic Republic'' and indicated he does not intend
to enter dialogue with opposition groups agitating for a more open
society, free elections and a free press.
   ``Our society already has enough democratic forums in which
different interests from various parts of the population'' can
express themselves, Krenz said.
   He hinted that rigid restrictions on travel abroad could be
modified or lifted. The difficulty of getting permission to travel
outside the country has been a chief complaint of protesters.
   The new leader also accused West German officials of meddling in
East Germany's affairs.
   The state-controlled Der Morgan newspaper in East Berlin said
today that ``at the center of the demands and suggestions (for
change) is the longing for deeds and decisions.''
   The newspaper called for ``open, productive and democratic''
discussions of the nation's problems but said they should take
place within the current socialist structure.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, speaking at
an East-West security conference in Frankfurt, urged Krenz to make
``fundamental reforms'' in the troubled nation and to make good on
a pledge to talk to ``all levels of society.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose reforms have been
rejected by East German leaders but embraced by much of the
populace, expressed confidence in a telegram published today that
Krenz will find solutions to the problems facing his country.
   Poland's Communist president, Wojciech Jaruzelski, commended the
contribution of Honecker to the development of Polish-East German
relations but said the new leadership will benefit the country.
   However, Poland's pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza said
Krenz may be a disappointing change for those who want greater
change.
   Poland has the East bloc's first government not led by
Communists. The 24-member Cabinet has only four Communist ministers.
   Hungary, which also is moving toward democratic reforms,
predicted that Krenz may only be a transitional leader until a
party congress due in May.
   The Magyar Nemzet daily, one of the more outspoken state-run
newspapers, said that meeting could bring a breakthrough for more
outspoken reformers.
   Two other Politburo members who had been heavily criticized
within the party lost their jobs Wednesday.
   They were Joachim Herrmann, 60, who ran the country's news media
and Guenter Mittag, 63, who made the East German economy the envy
of its East European neighbors but had come under criticism for a
lack of innovation.

   The nuclear-powered Galileo probe
raced across space today on its long voyage to Jupiter, while the
five orbiting Atlantis astronauts who released it began a day of
other experiments.
   Zipping along at about 9,600 mph, the probe was more than
150,000 miles from Earth at mid-morning, NASA said. Galileo was
deployed Wednesday night about six hours after the space shuttle
thundered into orbit.
   ``Galileo is on its way to another world,'' Atlantis commander
Don Williams said shortly after the 6,700-pound probe was gently
ejected from the shuttle's cargo bay by springs.
   The shuttle crew today ran some checks and pronounced the
primary cooling system ``healthy.'' It had shut down automatically
Wednesday when it became overheated, shifting to a backup.
   NASA said the problem was associated with the power needs of
Galileo when it was in the cargo bay.
   Mission Control awakened the space travelers today with a
musical tribute to Williams and pilot Mike McCulley, both naval
aviators and graduates of Purdue University. Reveille was
sandwiched between ``Hail Purdue'' and ``Anchors Aweigh.''
   ``I liked the first song better than the second,'' Williams
responded.
   The successful deployment of Galileo occurred as planned at 6:15
p.m. CDT over the Gulf of Mexico near Brownsville.
   ``Galileo looks absolutely super,'' radioed mission specialist
Shannon Lucid, who was in charge of the deployment. ``It's too bad
you all can't be here to see it.''
   After Williams and McCulley maneuvered the shuttle a safe
distance away, a two-stage rocket attached to the probe fired the
initial stage. The second ``burn'' occurred about five minutes
later, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said
both were successful.
   ``It achieved earth-escape velocity and is now heading outbound
toward the sun,'' Mission Control commentator Brian Welch said
Wednesday night. A spacecraft can escape the Earth's gravity when
traveling faster than 25,000 mph.
   Shortly after 8 p.m. CDT, Mission Control reported that the
two-stage rocket and the probe had separated, and that Galileo was
``on its own.''
   Galileo is powered by two electrical generators that are fueled
by highly radioactive plutonium. Anti-nuclear activists opposed the
use of plutonium but lost a lawsuit to block the launch.
   Although Jupiter is the probe's destination, Galileo also will
swing around Venus, the Earth and sun during its 2.4-billion-mile
journey. Gravity from Earth and Venus will help the spacecraft gain
momentum for its trip.
   During the six-year voyage, Galileo also will provide the first
close-up data about asteroids, passing within 600 miles of Gaspra
and Ida.
   Scientists hope the $1.5 billion Galileo _ the most expensive
unmanned space vehicle ever built _ will give the best look yet of
another planet and find clues to the universe's origin when it
reaches Jupiter.
   They believe the giant planet still holds much of the material,
in its original state, from which the universe formed more than 15
billion years ago.
   A robot on Galileo will dive through Jupiter's hydrogen-rich
atmosphere and radio back readings during the 75-minute plunge. But
Galileo itself will continue a wide orbit around the planet for 22
months, keeping track of changes in its weather for the first
long-term study of an outer planet.
   Atlantis' liftoff Wednesday was delayed twice _ once last week
because of a faulty engine computer and then on Tuesday because of
rain. But on Wednesday, Atlantis found a calm between two storm
systems and blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The anti-nuclear activists, who were fearful a Challengerlike
accident could spread radioactive contamination over Florida, had
threatened to infiltrate the launch site to stop the liftoff, but
there were no incidents Wednesday.
   During the rest of the mission, scheduled to end Monday with a
landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., the astronauts will
conduct several scientific and medical experiments.
   Other projects include an experiment to grow corn plants to see
how they develop without gravity; one to heat and cool plasticlike
materials to determine how they react in space; and a student
experiment designed to grow ice crystals in microgravity.
   In addition, an instrument in the cargo bay will measure
sections of the Earth's protective ozone layer in an attempt to
calibrate that data with readings taken by nearly identical
instruments on satellites.
   The other Atlantis crew members are mission specialists Ellen
Baker and Franklin Chang-Diaz.

<HEAD>Kentucky Mine Where 10 Died in Explosion Found to Have 280 Safety
Violations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal mine safety officials will
require the mine where 10 men died in an explosion last month to
correct 280 safety violations before it is allowed to reopen, a
spokesman said.
   A list of citations against Pyro Mining Co. was released
Wednesday by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration
office in Arlington, Va.
   The violations, which included 253 judged to be ``significant
and substantive,'' were found during an inspection following the
blast at the William Station Mine near Wheatcroft.
   The western Kentucky mine has been shut since the Sept. 13
methane gas explosion, the nation's worst mining disaster since
1984.
   MSHA spokeman Joey Lucas said Pyro, which owns the mine, would
``have to submit necessary plans, make required changes before the
mine is allowed to reopen.''
   Attempts to reach officials at Costain Co. Inc., Pyro's parent
company, Wednesday and today were unsuccessful. A receptionist at
Costain's office in Evansville, Ind., said no officials were
available for comment.
   The list released by MSHA did not give details of the violations.
   Mine safety officials found 12 violations ``highly likely'' to
result in an accident or illness, while 241 were likely to result
in an accident or illness.
   Eighteen violations represented a ``high degree'' of negligence,
MSHA found, while 246 violations represented a moderate degree.
   Of the citations, 37 were issued in the area of fire protection;
43 in the area of electrical equipment-general; 16 in roof support;
and 18 in the ventilation category.
   Costain President Charles Schulties said earlier that MSHA gave
informal approval for the removal of a ventilation barrier at
William Station Mine, an action that investigators say may have led
to the fatal explosion.
   Schulties said MSHA was ``well aware of this ventilation change
we were going to make,'' the Lexington Herald-Leader reported
Wednesday.
   The barrier was knocked down about 15 minutes before the fatal
explosion.
   However, Rexford Music, manager of MSHA's western Kentucky
district, said MSHA had not approved the barrier's removal. Music
charged that Schulties was ``just trying to shift some
responsibility, and it's not there to shift.''
   Shortly after the accident, MSHA reported that the Pyro mine had
been cited for 1,508 violations and fined $215,757 over the past
seven years.

<TEXT>
   A former campaign treasurer for Sen. Dennis
DeConcini has been indicted on five counts of mail fraud in the
theft of $500,000 from the senator's campaign fund.
   Thomas Karlsen, indicted Wednesday, was contrite and planned to
``do everything he can to make restitution,'' said his lawyer,
Craig Mehrens. ``He deeply regrets any embarrassment he has caused
the senator.''
   ``There is no great joy in seeing a friend indicted,'' DeConcini
said. ``I was very upset about this and still am, because I feel
very much violated.''
   DeConcini, D-Ariz., said he used his own money to pay about
$50,000 in campaign-related bills that Karlsen did not pay. In
addition, an audit of the fund will cost him $30,000 to $40,000,
DeConcini said.
   The indictment outlines charges dating to 1982 and accuses
Karlsen of devising a scheme to convert funds from political
contributions to his personal use.
   If convicted, Karlsen could face a maximum penalty of five years
in prison and a $250,000 fine on each of the five counts.
   Mehrens said much of the money went into tax shelters that the
Internal Revenue Service later disallowed. As a result, Karlsen
ended up owing the IRS, prompting him to divert more campaign
funds, the lawyer said.
   Karlsen also served briefly as campaign treasurer for Gov. Rose
Mofford but resigned shortly before the DeConcini fund was found to
be short in April.

   Computer controls and improved construction
techniques are dramatically improving the ability of the nation's
telephone network to withstand natural disasters such as hurricanes
and earthquakes, telephone officials say.
   During Tuesday's earthquake in Northern California, millions of
callers simultaneously went to their telephones to inquire of
friends and relatives ``Are you OK?'' or ``Did you see the
earthquake on TV?''
   That huge upsurge in long-distance calling _ more than 2{ times
normal nationwide between 8 p.m. and midnight Eastern Daylight Time
_ could have caused chaos 20 or 30 years ago.
   This time, computers rerouted calls and selectively blocked
others to keep the system from experiencing gridlock, said Jim
Nelson, director of AT&amp;T's network operations center in Bedminster,
N.J.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the company received a record
144.7 million long-distance calls nationwide between midnight
Tuesday and midnight Wednesday.
   Approximately 123.6 million calls were completed Wednesday,
Linnen said.
   Volume early today in Northern California ``has diminished but
continues to be above normal,'' Linnen added.
   Thanks to improved phone equipment, ``We are able to manage the
volume to at least not bring the system to a halt much more
effectively than ever before. ... We don't allow that extra load to
bog the system down,'' Nelson said.
   When Hurricane Hugo slammed ashore in South Carolina last month,
people in Charleston, S.C., received long-distance calls from
relatives during the worst of the storm, Ted Creech, a spokesman
for Southern Bell, said Wednesday.
   ``The reason they had that capability is that some 80 percent of
our cables are underground,'' Creech said. Much of that cable is
fiber-optic, which Creech said ``is much less susceptible to
moisture or corrosion.''
   Of Southern Bell's 1 million customers in South Carolina, 13,523
remained without service Wednesday, mostly because of water damage
to inside wiring or downed lines to their homes, Creech said.
   ``By far, especially in this kind of situation, underground
cable has proved to be the best in terms of service reliability,''
Creech said.
   Solid-state components, reinforced buildings, underground
fiber-optic cable and redundant systems have improved the phone
system dramatically from the days when high winds, snow or ice
could knock out service for days.
   ``The physical construction has improved dramatically, just like
the building construction on the high-rises'' in California, Nelson
said.
   Equally powerful is AT&amp;T's network of computers that sense where
backlogs are developing and reroute traffic through other parts of
the country.
   ``Unlike 20 or 30 years ago where you had very defined routing
paths ... that could easily overload and congest, we essentially
have a spider web around the country,'' Nelson said.
   ``The computers are smart enough to use any of the capability
anywhere in the country. We can talk to those computers ... to make
sure they allow enough of those calls through without gridlock,''
Nelson said.
   Sue Galloway, district manager for Pacific Bell's network in
Southern California, said Pacific's phone network has been designed
to withstand the largest earthquakes.
   ``We've done an awful lot of reinforcing ... at our central
office locations, and we've done a lot of changes of our network,''
she said.
   To keep the phone system operating, AT&amp;T blocked 60 to 70
percent of the incoming calls to the San Francisco area and 30
percent of the outgoing calls, Nelson said.
   US Sprint, the nation's No. 3 long-distance carrier, doubled its
volume of calls immediately after the earthquake Tuesday night,
said Al Butson, Sprint's director of network management and control
in Kansas City, Mo.
   Calls were running 40 percent above normal on Wednesday, Butson
said.
   Sprint spokesman Phil Hermanson said the Sprint network
``functioned very well, no losses, no outages. We weren't hit.''
   MCI officials said their system was functioning at capacity, but
with no breakdowns.
   Like AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint were blocking many calls to the San
Francisco area.

<TEXT>
   A 15-second earthquake caused a
transportation nightmare that will last for months as Bay area
residents cope with collapsed freeways, damaged bridges, landslides
and twisted rail lines.
   With major arteries closed between San Francisco to points south
and east, freeways jammed up starting at dawn today in the populous
southern section from from Hayward in the east to Gilroy in the
west. Traffic in the northern part of the nine-county region was
lighter, but gridlock was expected by midday.
   ``This is just a nightmare. This is something nobody ever
believed would happen, to cut San Francisco off from the East
Bay,'' said Andrew Nevin, 41, of Oakland, who got up at 3 a.m. to
drive into San Francisco.
   Nevin, who normally commutes 18 miles, had a circuitous 45-mile
trek.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit line between San Francisco and
Oakland closed Wednesday because of a reported leak in the tube
under San Francisco Bay but it reopened later. The load today was
slightly less than the normal 50,000, said spokesman Mike Healy.
``We expect people will be coming in a little later than usual
because they're trying to figure out how best to get into the
city.''
   That link had become especially vital after the quake cut off a
main route _ the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, where a 50-foot
section collapsed. The subway closing left ferries as the only
remaining direct link between the cities. Ferry service was
bolstered from Southern California vessels.
   Motorists still may get across the bay using bridges north or
south of the Bay Bridge, but each is at least 25 miles out of the
way.
   California Department of Transportation officials said the
collapsed section of the Bay Bridge was to be lifted today so they
could estimate how long repairs will take.
   The quake also collapsed a 1\-mile section of Interstate 880, a
major artery near the bridge in Oakland. Authorities estimated 250
people were killed when the highway's upper deck fell onto the
lower level during rush hour.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who viewed the
wreckage Wednesday from the air, said repairs could take 18 months.
``One of the things you are going to have to do is to plan how you
are going to in the next year or year and a half deal with the fact
that 880 is not going to be operational.''
   In an effort to ease the burden for commuters, Los Angeles-based
Catalina Cruises sent four 700-passenger vessels to supplement
ferry service, said Terry Koenig, general manager.
   Closer to the quake's epicenter, about 55 miles south of San
Francisco, a landslide closed Highway 17 linking the Bay area with
Santa Cruz. Del Corral, of Raisch Construction, said it will take
at least two months to clear.
   Repairing the crippled highway network will cost at least $500
million, Caltrans officials told the state Transportation
Commission. Caltrans also said surveyors were inspecting about
1,500 bridges within 50 miles of the epicenter.
   Quake-damaged rail lines into Oakland from Los Angeles stopped
Amtrak's northbound Coast Starlight at Salinas, about 60 miles from
San Francisco, said spokeswoman Sue Martin. Amtrak provided buses
to either Martinez or Sacramento, where other trains continued the
trip into the Pacific Northwest.
   There were no immediate estimates on when the Amtrak lines would
be fixed.
   The historic Amtrak passenger terminal in West Oakland likely
will be torn down because it was so damaged, officials said.
   San Francisco International Airport was open, but some airlines
cut operations due to quake-damaged terminals. United Airlines' Joe
Hopkins said the quake forced the carrier to cancel 16 of 136 daily
flights Wednesday.
   Oakland Airport also was open, but its main runway was closed.

<HEAD>Speedier Evacuation of Dependents Under Consideration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is considering a
speed-up of its withdrawal of U.S. military dependents from Panama,
the White House said today.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that since last spring, 6,300
Defense Department personnel had either been relocated onto U.S.
bases in Panama or sent home. But there are still roughly 11,000
dependents in the country.
   The Washington Times reported today that the newly appointed
U.S. military commander in Panama, Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, has
asked his superiors to evacuate most dependents from Panama.
   The newspaper, citing military sources in Panama, said Thurman
wanted the dependents evacuated to heighten the sense of war among
his troops in Panama, where the United States has pressed for the
removal of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as leader of the Central
American country.
   Noriega is wanted in the United States on indictments charging
drug trafficking. He recently quashed an attempted coup that
received minimal support from U.S. forces.
   Fitzwater told reporters the administration was reviewing
whether the withdrawal of dependents ``should be accelerated (and)
whether there should be any special efforts made.''
   The ``ultimate purpose,'' he said, has always been to have
``people leave Panama and return to the United States.''
   ``We have been reviewing this matter since the spring, and we
announced a program in May which called for the return to the
United States of many of the dependents in Panama,'' he said.
   As of July 1, he said, 6,300 Defense Department employees and
their dependents had either been sent home or relocated from
civilian housing into U.S. military installations in Panama.
   Currently, he said, the United States has 10,000 soldiers
permanently assigned to Panama, 2,500 military people there on
temporary duty, 7,700 military dependents, 2,700 U.S. civilian
Pentagon employees and 3,300 civilian dependents.
   Asked whether the White House considered the situation in Panama
akin to a state of war, Fitzwater replied:
   ``We have always said that there is a status involving some
danger in Panama. That was the reason for our first actions, to try
to move people, certainly dependents of military people, back onto
the base.
   ``You'll recall incidents of harassment, people in some cases
being assaulted physically. And so there has always been a
dangerous situation there that we were trying to alleviate,'' he
said.
   But pressed on whether it was amounted to war, Fitzwater said,
``We haven't used that term.''

<TEXT>
   Commonwealth leaders today said
nations should put more financial pressure on South Africa and
criticized an agreement by international banks to reschedule part
of the country's foreign debt.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia said Commonwealth leaders
were ``disappointed'' that foreign banks agreed to reschedule $8
billion of South Africa's $20 billion debt.
   In South Africa, Finance Minister Barend du Plessis welcomed the
debt rescheduling as ``one of the most important international
events for South Africa this year.''
   News of the bank deal came as leaders of the 49-nation
Commonwealth met in closed session to debate sanctions against
South Africa, which quit the Commonwealth in 1961.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, the sole opponent
of sanctions in the association of Britain and its former colonies,
insists embargoes now would be irresponsible.
   Mrs. Thatcher defended her stand today and accused the
Commonwealth of promoting poverty through embargoes. ``Our course
is constructive. We want to help the people of South Africa,'' she
said.
   Australia is proposing a sanction plan for South Africa that
calls on international banks to toughen lending conditions,
including limiting maxium credit terms to 90 days.
   It also calls for setting up a monitoring agency to scrutinize
South Africa's links with the international financial community.
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, at a news conference on the
second day of the biennial summit, said bloodshed threatened to
engulf southern Africa.
   ``Bankers are sucking at that blood by supporting South Africa.
They are bloodsuckers,'' he said.
   Commonwealth leaders, apart from Mrs. Thatcher, had planned to
launch a new drive to try to stymie South Africa's efforts to
reschedule the $8 billion of its foreign debt that is due next June.
   On Wednesday, Canadian officials said a three-nation
Commonwealth team of representatives from Canada, Australia and
India has been lobbying major international banks and received what
he called a ``favorable response.''
   But within hours, the South African Reserve Bank announced it
has reached a deal with the creditors, mostly American and European
banks.
   On Wednesday Mrs. Thatcher, arguing that South African President
F.W. de Klerk deserves encouragement, urged the Commonwealth not to
rebuff ``the most helpful sign for many years that progress was
possible.''
   She cited de Klerk's release this week of eight black
nationalist leaders, relaxation of restrictions on anti-government
demonstrations and his ``willingness to consult all shades of
opinion.''
   Canada proposes maintaining existing sanctions but holding off
on new ones for six months as a challenge to de Klerk to get the
white-dominated Parliament to abolish race laws by then.
   The laws include regulations that deny the black majority the
vote and segregate residential areas and health services.
   Commonwealth officials predicted that the six-month moratorium
proposal was likely to be supported, although reluctantly, by some
African and Asian countries.
   Most Commonwealth leaders maintain that sanctions, although
unevenly applied, have forced South Africa to move toward change.
   Britain, a major South African trading partner, has long argued
that sanctions hurt blacks most and increase white resistance to
change.
   A list of Commonwealth sanctions drawn up in 1986 included bans
on air links, imports of farm produce and a range of other goods.
   As a compromise, Britain agreed to a handful of the embargoes.
Black southern African countries, which depend economically on
South Africa, have also taken only limited measures.

   Spanish novelist and essayist Camilo
Jose Cela, who used the horrors of the Spanish Civil War to infuse
his work with an often grotesque and violent imagery, today won the
Nobel Prize in literature.
   Cela, 73, was cited by the Swedish Academy for his ``rich and
intensive prose, which with restrained compassion forms a
challenging vision of man's vulnerability.''
   Cela was the fifth Spaniard to win the Nobel Prize in
literature. He said he felt he shared the award with many other
Spanish and Latin American writers.
   ``For me this is something I`m very proud of,'' Cela told
Spanish National Radio from his home in Guadalajara, Spain. ``I
offer it to all of literature in Spanish. I believe that other
authors, Spanish and Latin American, who write in Spanish could
also have won it for the same reasons as I, but, in the end, I won
it, and I'm very, very happy.''
   Cela's best known work is the 1942 novel ``The Family of Pascual
Duarte,'' in which he created a new literary style known as
``tremendismo,'' emphasizing violence and grotesque imagery.
   The novel, a first-person account of a murderer awaiting
execution, was banned in Spain but established Cela's reputation as
a writer. It was considered the most important postwar novel and
set a new direction for Spanish literature toward concise and sober
writing.
   Cela's masterpiece is considered ``The Hive,'' from 1951, which
captures three days in the life of Madrid four years after the
civil war.
   Cela has written 10 novels among his 70 works of travelogs,
short stories and poetry.
   The Swedish Academy called him ``the leading figure in Spain's
literary renewal during the postwar era.''
   ``Cela is a restless spirit,'' who often expresses himself ``in
an old Spanish tradition of hilarious grotesqueness,'' it said.
   Sture Allen, the Academy's secretary, called Cela ``provocative
and innovative'' in both his form and subject matter.
   ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' was probably the most widely
read Spanish novel since ``Don Quixote,'' the Academy said. It also
singled out as ``a sensation'' his 1969 novel ``San Camilo,'' which
describes the weeks before the outbreak of civil war.
   Cela was the first Spaniard to win the Nobel since 1977, when it
was awarded to poet Vicente Aleixandre. Cela was chosen from about
150 candidates, Allen said. The prize this year is worth about
$463,000.
   As publisher of the literary magazine ``Papeles de Son
Armadans'' from 1956 to 1979, Cela also was credited for providing
a forum for young opposition writers during the ``years of
hardship,'' a reference to the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco
Franco.
   His writing ``broadened the range of Spanish writing'' and
widely influenced Latin American literature, Allen said after
reading the citation to reporters at the Academy's 18th century
headquarters.
   Cela was born May 11, 1916, in the town of Iria Flavia to a
middle class family that counted among its forebearers both Spanish
aristocrats and English pirates.
   His medical studies were interrupted by the 1936-39 Civil War.
Suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, he returned to his native
Galicia district, which was controlled by Franco's Nationalists.
Forced to join the Nationalists as a private, he was seriously
wounded.
   After the war he began studying law in Madrid but devoted much
of his time to writing. He turned to writing full time after
producing ``The Family of Pascual Duarte.''
   In 1977, King Juan Carlos appointed Cela a senator in the first
Spanish Parliament, and he assisted in writing the Spanish
Constitution in 1978.
   He received the 1987 Prince of Asturias Award for Literature,
given by a foundation named for the heir to the Spanish throne, and
has been a member of the Spanish Academy literary group since 1957.
   Other well-known works by Cela include ``Journey to the
Alcarria'' from 1948, a diary of his walking trip through rural
Castille, and ``Jews, Moors and Christians'' from 1956, an essay of
the impact of religion on Spanish history.
   The Nobel Prize in literature was the last of the six prizes to
be awarded for 1989. All were worth $463,000 this year.
   The Nobel Peace Prize was given to the Dalai Lama, the exiled
spiritual and political leader of Tibet, for his non-violent
struggle to free his Himalayan nation from Chinese rule.
   The prize in medicine went to J. Michael Bishop and Harold E.
Varmus of the United States for their discovery of a family of
genes that helped scientists better understand how cancer develops.
   Trygve Haavelmo of Norway won the prize in economics for showing
that mathematical probabilities could be used to predict the
puzzling shifts in the economy.
   American Thomas Cech and Canadian-born Sidney Altman, a U.S.
citizen since 1984, won the chemistry prize for their work with the
genetic material RNA. The physics prize was awarded to American
Norman F. Ramsey for the atomic clock used as the international
time standard and to American Hans G. Dehmelt and West German
Wolfgang Paul for a method to isolate single atoms.
   The prizes were first given in 1901 from the estate of Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite.

   The winner of this year's Nobel Prize in
literature, Camilo Jose Cela, is better known in his homeland for
his love of food, travel and women than for his 10 novels and
numerous short stories and travelogues.
   Cela received the Nobel Prize in literature today, becoming the
fifth Spaniard to do so.
   Although his best-known novels, ``The Family of Pascual Duarte''
and ``The Hive,'' have been successfully translated into films, he
is known to most Spaniards for his sojourns through Spain in a
Rolls Royce, for his love of crude expressions and for his
flamboyant lifestyle.
   The 73-year-old writer most recently made news when he publicly
acknowledged a romantic liaison with Marina Castano, a woman half
his age who is his muse and literary helpmate.
   Cela is separated but not divorced from his wife of many years
and has one son, Camilo Jose Cela Conde, who acknowledged last week
in a radio interview that it was difficult being the offspring of
such a public character.
   Ms. Castano said Cela still writes everything in longhand and
has no idea how to operate a typewriter or a word processor.
   Cela told reporters he was ``not really surprised'' by the news
he had received the award but said it could just as well have gone
to many other Spanish writers.
   ``But life is like a game of tennis, and this time I won,'' he
said.
   He said the $463,000 prize will ``come in very handy.''
   ``I'll use it to pay my debts, and believe me, I've got a lot of
them.''
   He said Spain has been overshadowed by Latin America in
literature for some time because of its ``foolish provincialism.''
   ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' from 1942, Cela's first novel,
was first published in Argentina because it was deemed too violent
and crude for Spain at the time.
   It tells the story in uncommonly straightforward language of a
rural, uneducated man who commits a series of brutal murders
without really knowing why and ends up being executed. It often is
credited with creating a sort of literary vanguard in the years
immediately following the bloody 1936-39 Civil War.
   ``The Hive'' takes place in the cold, depressing postwar years
and tells the story of starving writers who would sit for hours
during the winter in Madrid's literary cafes.
   Cela said he is working on a new project now, but he refused to
say what it is. ``You never really know how these things are going
to turn out until the end.''
   Cela was the first Spanish novelist to win the Nobel prize.
   In 1977, two years after the death of 36-year dictator Gen.
Francisco Franco, Vicente Aleixandre, an obscure poet from Spain's
pre-war literary generation, received the Nobel Prize for
literature. Fellow poet Juan Ramon Jimenez received the award in
1956.
   Spain's first literary Nobel laureate was playwright Jose
Echegaray, who won in 1904. Playwright Jacinto Benavente won the
award in 1922.

<HEAD>Specter Says He Will Vote to Acquit Miami Jurist</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: CORRECTS Specter to R-Pa. sted D-Pa. in 2nd graf</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The vice chairman of the Senate panel that
heard four weeks of evidence against federal Judge Alcee L.
Hastings this summer said today he will vote to acquit the Miami
jurist in his impeachment trial.
   ``On the totality of this record ... weighing the incriminating
circumstantial inferences against the exonerating factors and
giving due weight to his other unblemished lifetime record, I
conclude there is insufficent evidence to convict,'' Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., said of the bribery conspiracy charge against
Hastings.
   Specter, the top Republican on the evidence panel, also said in
a 76-page paper that he would vote to acquit Hastings of charges
that he lied to a jury that found him innocent of bribery
conspiracy charges in 1983.
   Prosecutors in that case told the jury that testimony from
Hastings was false, Specter said. ``Obviously the jury did not
accept those arguments.''
   He said impeachment evidence that Hastings had improperly
disclosed information obtained from a wiretap ``was neither
convincing nor substantial.''
   Specter's comments came as the Senate prepared to close its
doors and deliberate the charges against Hastings.
   In final arguments the Senate was urged on Wednesday to
disregard race as a factor in the case and decide the matter soley
on the facts.
   ``There have been a lot of cases in our judicial system in which
race has been a problem,'' Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., told the
Senate on Wednesday. ``This isn't one of them or I would be the
first to tell you.''
   Hastings, the first black federal judge in Florida history, is
accused of conspiring to get a $150,000 payoff and lying to a jury
that acquitted him of the charges in 1983.
   He also is accused of improperly disclosing information obtained
from a government wiretap.
   The Senate heard final arguments Wednesday and planned to
deliberate behind closed doors today. A vote is expected before the
weekend.
   ``I wish I could be a fly on the wall for those deliberations,''
said the 53-year-old Hastings as he emerged from the Senate chamber.
   Conviction by the Senate on any of the 17 impeachment articles
approved by the House in August 1988 would immediately remove
Hastings from the U.S. District bench in Miami and stop his $89,500
salary.
   It would make Hastings the sixth official in history removed by
impeachment. The most recent was Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada in
1986 who fought in vain to remain on the bench while serving a tax
fraud sentence.
   District Judge Walter Nixon of Mississippi, convicted of lying
to a grand jury, is also currently fighting to remain on the
federal bench.
   Conyers, a leading House proponent of civil rights legislation,
warned against any notion that race was a factor in the Hastings
case.
   He said Hastings was given a position of trust ``but he has
betrayed that trust and he has betrayed those who looked to him for
leadership.''
   ``We did not wage the civil rights struggle in order to trade
one form of judicial corruption for another,'' Conyers said.
   The Senate galleries, filled about equally with black and white
faces, broke into applause after Hastings himself took the Senate
floor and denied he was claiming racial discrimination as part of
his defense.
   ``I am not guilty of having committed any crime _ that is my
defense,'' Hastings said. ``Please act fairly.''
   Hastings attorney Terence J. Anderson of Miami told senators the
evidence was only circumstantial.
   ``What you have here is Swiss cheese,'' he told the Senate.
   Hastings appeared at a Miami restaurant at a time set by an FBI
undercover agent who was part of a ``sting'' operation against a
Washington lawyer claiming the power to influence the judge's
actions.
   The judge also ordered the government to return $845,000 in
confiscated funds as Washington lawyer William Borders said he
would in negotiations with the undercover agent.
   Both actions were offered by Borders as proof that Hastings
would do as he was told and change two prison sentences to
probation for a $150,000 bribe.
   House managers rejected a contention that the impeachment trial
was unfair in light of his previous acquittal.
   ``What if all the facts indicate the judge's guilt?'' Rep. John
Bryant, D-Texas, told the Senate. ``We deeply believe that Judge
Hastings conspired to obtain a bribe from defendants in his court,
that to avoid conviction for this crime he fabricated evidence and
lied to a federal jury 14 times.''

   An appeals court today threw out the convictions
of four people blamed in a 1975 IRA terrorist bombing after the
government said investigators may have faked evidence.
   Relatives and others in the gallery of Old Bailey court cheered
as Lord Lane, the chief justice, announced that the convictions had
been reversed. The court also reversed the convictions of two of
the four in a second bombing.
   ``I've been in prison for 15 years for something I didn't do,''
Gerard Conlon, 35, shouted to a cheering crowd outside the court as
he walked free.
   Two co-defendants also were freed. A fourth was freed and then
immediately arrested in connection with a murder case in Belfast.
   In addition to Conlon, the defendants included Carole
Richardson, 32, Patrick Armstrong, 39, and Paul Hill, 35. They were
sentenced to life in prison for killing five people in an explosion
at a pub in Guildford, southwest of London, on October 5, 1974.
   But new evidence ``throws such doubt upon the honesty and
integrity of a number of the Surrey officers investigating this
case in 1974 that the Crown now feels unable to say that the
convictions of any of the four are safe or satisfactory,'' Roy
Amlot of the Office of Public Prosecutions told the hearing.
   Amlot said there was evidence that officers had altered notes of
interviews and, in one case, covered up the fact that a defendant
had been interviewed after being charged, a violation of English
law.
   ``It is clear that a full criminal investigation of these
matters is called for,'' Amlot added.
   Armstrong and Hill also were convicted of a pub bombing in the
London suburb of Woolwich on Nov. 6, 1974, which killed two people
and injured 26. The appeals court also reversed those convictions.
   Hill, who was also serving a life sentence for the murder of a
British soldier in Northern Ireland, was rearrested as he left
court. He was to fly today to Belfast, where his attorneys said
they would ask a court to release him on bail pending an appeal of
the murder conviction.
   The prosecution's case in the bombings was based solely on
confessions the four repudiated in court. The convictions were
upheld in 1977 even after four members of an Irish Republic Army
gang made their own detailed confessions in the attacks.
   The presence in court of Ireland's ambassador to Britain, Andrew
O'Rourke, reflected the Irish government's efforts to have this
case and other bombing cases from the 1970s reviewed.
   In 1980, Lord Denning, then the chief civil judge in England,
ruled against the six, who claimed police had beaten them.
   Justice, a non-partisan legal reform group led by a former
appeals judge, said in July that false confessions were a leading
cause of unjust criminal verdicts, of which it estimated there were
15 or more every year in Britain.

   Mayor Art Agnos said he was ``ticked off''
that Vice President Dan Quayle had time for television cameras but
not for him during a tour of earthquake-damaged areas of the city.
   Quayle, who promised federal relief for earthquake victims after
visiting the Bay area Wednesday, today dismissed the liberal
Democratic mayor's criticism.
   ``I would hope that the mayor would resist any kind of political
rhetoric at this time and concentrate all the energies and all of
our dedication to helping the victims and helping the families of
the victims, and let's get the situation stabilized first,'' Quayle
said on CBS's ``This Morning.''
   And on NBC's ``Today'' show, he said that he thought it was
``very unfortunate to take that kind of a shot at a very difficult
time. ... I was there to help people.''
   Agnos said Wednesday he was ``ticked off'' that Quayle ``flies
around in a helicopter, makes a bunch of television spots'' but
didn't meet with him. The mayor had said before Quayle's visit that
he planned to meet with Quayle to urge immediate federal help.
   ``I understand he was in the Marina and in the shelters and then
left. If he did so without visiting the mayor, I have real
questions about what he was doing here. It may have been just a
publicity stunt,'' Agnos said.
   President Bush said today he would go to the Bay area on Friday
and presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Agnos would
be invited to a session between Bush and local officials.
   Fitzwater denied that the Republican vice president had snubbed
Agnos.
   Agnos was invited to two meetings with Quayle ``and he declined
to attend both meetings,'' Fitzwater said.
   Furthermore, ``we offered to send a helicopter to pick him up
wherever he was and deliver him to the meetings and he declined
that.''
   White House chief of staff John Sununu has ``been trying to
reach him on the phone for several days and he has declined to talk
to us,'' Fitzwater said. ``We regret very much that the mayor of
San Francisco has decided not to cooperate with us in this matter.''
   Quayle met with officials in Alameda County across San Francisco
Bay to assess the need for federal assistance.
   On his tour, Quayle appeared stunned by the magnitude of damage
and loss of life inflicted by the temblor. Quayle and his wife,
Marilyn, spent six hours touring the area by helicopter and on foot
after President Bush authorized federal disaster assistance.
   Upon his return to Washington late Wednesday, Quayle said that
federal aid would be forthcoming.
   Quayle, accompanied by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
and Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., met with mayors of more than half a
dozen cities around the bay and emergency officials at the Alameda
Naval Air Station.
   ``My impression was one of great sadness for the number of
people that lost their lives and the families that are impacted,''
Quayle said after seeing crushed cars on collapsed portions of the
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and Interstate 880 in Oakland.
   ``You can't help but be impressed by the magnitude of the
earthquake,'' he said. ``To see 880 flattened like a pancake, it's
really a sobering sight.''

<TEXT>
   Two mannequins wearing the latest
fashions stood undamaged in the window of Ford's Department Store.
Around them, the rubble of caved-in roofs, crumbled walls and
shattered windows littered the sidewalks.
   Tuesday's earthquake caused only four known deaths here, but the
damage was among the worst. Initial estimates were $350 million,
and Mayor Mardi Wormhoudt said 30 percent of the downtown mall _
the city's heart _ was severely damaged.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service said today it would
send 15 dogs, used to find victims of the Mexico City earthquake,
would be flown in to search the Pacific Garden Mall for people in
the debris.
   Police arrested at least five people Wednesday night after
friends of a woman missing in the rubble marched to protest the
decision to stop the search. Several yelled `Don't Leave her
there!' as they gathered by the destroyed Santa Cruz Coffee
Roasting Co., where the woman, an employee of the shop, is buried.
   Police Sgt. Joe Haebe said people were arrested after they broke
through barricades. Protesters said authorities tried to break up
the march.
   ``Police grabbed people who went by, knocking them with billy
clubs,'' said Ericka Burchett.
   Protesters urged officials to continue searching under
floodlights. Police spokesman Andy Crane said the lights would
create too many shadows for an effective search.
   The shop was one of six buildings that collapsed entirely, said
Wormhoudt. ``This is as bad a catastrophe as anyone could imagine
for the city. The downtown business district as we knew it _ with
many historical buildings _ is gone. It will be built again, but it
will not be the downtown that we knew.''
   An estimated 20 downtown commercial buildings must be razed _
``the heart of the community and its vitality,'' said Gary Patton,
chairman of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors.
   The quake's epicenter was about eight miles northeast of the
city of 45,000 people, 75 miles south of San Francisco.
   Turn-of-the-century stores made of brick bore the brunt of the
quake as walls toppled onto sidewalks, and roofs crashed through
ceilings onto merchandise below.
   One wall of the Metropole Hotel slammed onto the department
store roof, spewing rubble over the floor. A rack of dust-covered
dresses lay draped on the windowsill and sidewalk, near the
mannequins.
   Merchants hoping to return to business, and residents of
downtown hotels were kept behind yellow ribbons placed to keep all
but emergency personnel out until structures were declared safe.
   ``I no longer have a home,'' wailed Kathleen Madden, who lived
in and worked at the St. George Hotel.
   The town's most popular attraction, the beachside boardwalk next
to Monterey Bay, showed some cracks in its games building. There
was no visible damage to the wooden Giant Dipper roller coaster.
   Across the street, 25 residents of a senior citizens hotel were
evacuated to a church because of cracks in the hotel.
   ``Everyone is hurt, and everyone is going to need help with the
recovery,'' said County Supervisor Fred Keely.
   Residents shopped at the few stores that were open, stocking up
on bottled water because officials warned the city supply might not
be safe, and charcoal briquets and batteries in case the
electricity remained off. Lights were restored to part of Santa
Cruz by midafternoon.
   Four of those arrested Wednesday night would be charged with
disobeying a police officer, and the fifth with hitting an officer,
Crane said.
   Haebe was not optimistic about the woman's survival.
   ``We have search and rescue dogs that specialize in finding
people who are buried, but they did not key into any sign of
life,'' Haebe said. ``If there would have been even a hint of life,
we would have taken more extraordinary steps.''
   The woman's friends refused to give up hope.
   ``She's a strong woman and I think she could still be alive,''
said Anne Gfeller.

   The city is fining itself $2,100 for
violating its own odor pollution rules.
   The enforcement is an outgrowth of Mayor Tommy Hazouri's
anti-odor campaign to rid the city of its smelly reputation, and
several private companies have been charged with violations.
   As part of a settlement announced Wednesday, the city Wastewater
Division has agreed to a plan in which numerous measures will be
taken to reduce odor, said Jerry Woosley, an associate engineer
with the city's Bio-Environmental Services Division.
   The $2,100 fine is to be paid to that division.
   The Buckman Street sewage treatment plant was cited for odor
pollution in May after the pollution division validated six
complaints.
   As part of the compliance plan, the sewage plant will be granted
a one-year exemption from the city's odor pollution law while the
improvements are being made.

   A top Vatican official left Thursday for
Moscow, apparently to help plan an historic meeting between Pope
John Paul II and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Archbishop Angelo Sodano, secretary for relations with states,
the equivalent of foreign minister, would meet with Soviet
government officials, according to a brief Vatican announcement.
   His trip follows the visit to Rome in August of Juri Karlov, a
representative of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, who was received by
the pope and gave him a letter from Gorbachev, the Vatican said.
   The statement gave no details, but a Vatican source, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Sodano clearly was going to prepare
for the Gorbachev visit.
   Gorbachev will meet with the pope during a Nov. 29-Dec. 1 visit.
It would be the first meeting between the head of the Soviet
Communist Party and the leader of the Roman Catholic Church.

<HEAD>Soviet Military Transport Plane Crashes, 57 Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military transport plane carrying paratroopers
to keep order in the ethnically torn southern republic of
Azerbaijan lost an engine and crashed in the Caspian Sea, killing
all 57 people aboard, it was reported Thursday.
   The left engine of the Ilyushin-76 plane caught fire minutes
after it took off from an unidentified airport in the Azerbaijani
part of the Caucasus Military District, Izvestia said.
   ``The fire spread so fast that within three minutes, the engine
fell off, but the fire did not stop,'' the newspaper reported,
quoting Col. Gen. V. Pankin. He said Cmdr. A. Kalmikov, 48, had
tried to fly the crippled plane back to the airport.
   A few miles from his goal, ``the Ilyushin careened sharply to
the left and fell'' into shallow water less than a mile from shore,
the newspaper said.
   Tass did not say more precisely where or when the crash
occurred. It said the huge transport plane carried a crew of seven
as well as 50 passengers.
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told a news conference that
rescuers initially believed some of those on board might have
survived.
   ``It was during the night so rescue work was very difficult,''
he said.
   Workers recovered parts of the engines and fuselage from the
water, he said. Specialists were searching for the plane's ``black
box,'' Izvestia said, using the Western term for an aircraft voice
and data recorder that might shed light on the reason for the crash.
   The Il-76 has four turbofan engines. Its wings are mounted atop
the fuselage and are 150 feet long, according to Jane's All the
World's Aircraft.
   ``The U.S.S.R. Defense Ministry expressed its deep condolences
to the families of the dead,'' Tass said.
   Troops have been patrolling Azerbaijan and neighboring Armenia
since last year to prevent more violence between residents feuding
over the district of Nagorno-Karabakh. More than 100 people have
died in violence related to the dispute.

<TEXT>
   Fifteen dissident workers have been
arrested for organizing illegal strikes as part of a campaign to
promote socialist ideology, police said Thursday.
   Charges will be filed after further investigation, they said.
   Police said the workers were arrested Wednesday in raids on
houses near factories west of Seoul, and more arrests are possible.
   The workers, all college graduates, set up a dissident labor
organization called the Alliance of Democratic Labor Unions last
year and have instigated 20 illegal strikes, police said.
   In a strike at a kitchen utensil manufacturing plant, two
workers and a company executive were burned to death in a fire
started by union members, police said.
   The alliance sought to promote socialism and spread propaganda
bills and newsletters accusing the government of suppressing labor
activity, police said.
   Also on Thursday, about 500 fired teachers continued sit-ins at
offices of the three main opposition parties for a second straight
day, demanding their outlawed labor union be sanctioned.
   The teachers demanded that the three opposition parties, which
control a majority of seats in the 299-member National Assembly,
agree to a bill legalizing the formation of South Korea's first
teachers' union.
   The government outlawed a union formed by dissident teachers
this year and fired about 2,000 teachers who refused to give up
membership. About a dozen union members also were arrested.
   There are about 300,000 primary, middle and high school teachers
in South Korea.

   Three gunmen killed a
Protestant at his home, and the Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility.
   Robert Metcalfe, 40, was shot three times Wednesday night by men
who burst into his home in Magheralin, 17 miles southwest of
Belfast.
   The IRA, in a message to Belfast news organizations, claimed
Metcalfe was involved with Protestant paramilitary attacks against
Catholics in the area.
   Police said Metcalfe's wife and teen-age daughter witnessed the
attack.
   Police said the gunmen used a stolen car which was later found
burned out five miles from the scene of the attack but gave few
other details.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent
Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.

   A major earthquake struck rural north China early
today, killing at least 29 people and flattening about 8,000 homes,
official reports said.
   A three-paragraph report by the Xinhua News Agency said 34
people were injured. It said aftershocks continued.
   The quake was centered about 135 miles west of Beijing on the
border of Shanxi and Hebei provinces, and was felt in the capital.
The epicenter was near Datong, famous for its Yungang Caves that
hold thousands of Buddhist paintings and statues dating back to the
5th century.
   It was not known if the quake damaged any of the caves. Efforts
to reach Datong by telephone were not successful.
   The Chinese quake came less than 24 hours after a massive
earthquake hit San Francisco, but State Seismological Bureau
officials said there was no evidence of a link between the two
temblors.
   Bureau director, Fang Zhangsun, told Xinhua that additional
strong aftershocks were unlikely.
   He said transportation and communications in the quake area
remained intact and that relief work was being carried out, but he
gave no details.
   An official at the Civil Affairs Ministry, in charge of disaster
relief, said: ``We're looking into it now. Call us back tomorrow.''
   The affected region is a dry, windswept farming area, where the
main crops are wheat and other grains and most people live in
one-story homes of unfired clay bricks. Such buildings easily
collapse in an strong quake.
   Shanxi also is China's main coal-producing province and the
stark brown land is pocked with coal mines.
   The Seismological Bureau said the first quake hit at 10:57 p.m.
Wednesday (10:57 a.m. EDT) and measured 5.7 on the Richter scale.
At least four others registering 5 or above hit in the next six
hours, including a quake of 6 on the scale at about 1 a.m. today.
   An aftershock measuring 5.1 hit at 6:29 p.m., Xinhua said. More
than 300 lesser aftershocks were recorded.
   Earthquakes are frequent in China, with the most recent serious
tremor injuring 54 people and destroying 4,000 homes in southwest
China's Sichuan province last month.
   Five earthquakes, measuring up to 6.7 on the Richter scale,
struck western Sichuan in a three-week period in June and July,
killing 11 people.
   China's worst earthquake in recent history leveled the northeast
city of Tangshan in 1976, leaving 240,000 dead by official count.
Unofficial estimates have put the death toll at three times that
number. Its magnitude was estimated at 8.0.
   The Richter scale is a measure off ground movement as recorded
by seismographs. The open-ended scale is logarithmic, meaning that
each degree of intensity is 10 times stronger than the last.
   Thus the 6.9 magnitude quake that hit San Francisco Tuesday
evening is 10 times stronger than one registering 5.9 on the scale.

   The Senate today defeated a proposed
constitutional amendment to ban burning and desecration of the
American flag, delivering a sharp rebuff to President Bush on a
high-profile issue.
   The vote was 51-48 in favor, but constitutional amendments
require approval by a two-thirds margin in both houses of Congress
and the Senate vote thus fell far short.
   ``We can support the American flag without changing the American
Constitution,'' Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, declared
before the vote.
   The measure would authorize the state and federal governments to
ban burning and desecration of the flag.
   Eighteen Democrats joined 33 Republicans in support of the
amendment, while 37 Democrats and 11 Republicans voted against it.
   Bush repeatedly called for approval of such a measure, saying a
simple statute such as one approved by the Senate last week would
be inadequate.
   Critics of the amendment said it amounted to tampering the
constitutional right of Americans to freedom of expression. But
they also expressed concern that opposition could be turned against
them at election time in view of the power of the flag as a
political symbol as demonstrated in last year's campaign.
   Those concerns appeared to ease a bit in recent days. Asked why
that was, Mitchell told reporters this morning: ``I think the sound
judgment of the American people.'' Other lawmakers said they
thought most Americans are not very concerned about the amendment.
   ``We in America have chosen not to take the easy way out,''
Mitchell told the Senate. ``We have chosen not to silence those who
are wrong. We have chosen instead to challenge them with the
truth.''
   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., making a final appeal for the
measure, declared that ``the flag stands alone as a unique symbol
of our hopes and our aspirations and our ideals as a nation.''
   ``To say that the act of flag burning is somehow deeply
enshrined in the First Amendment is preposterous,'' Dole said. He
said it was wrong in view of law that ``make it illegal to rip the
warning label off your own mattress in some states.''
   To be approved, the proposed amendment needed 66 votes, equal to
two-thirds of the senators present and voting. It thus fell 15
votes short.
   Dole was glum in reacting to the vote, although it did not come
as a surprise. ``I think the flag should be flown at half-staff
after this vote,'' he said.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, told colleagues that ``we did good work.''
   ``We saved the flag and preserved the Constitution,'' he said.
   Republican sponsors said the measure would end once and for all
the controversy over whether laws against flag-burning are
unconstitutional.
   The Supreme Court in June threw out the conviction of Texas
flag-burner Gregory Lee Johnson, ruling that his freedom of speech
had been violated. Within days Bush called for a constitutional
amendment.
   The House approved last week and sent to the president a bill
that would ban flag-burning by simple statute. Bush said he would
allow it to become law without his signature and vowed to press on
for the amendment.
   Democratic critics said the amendment amounted to tampering with
the Bill of Rights. They said a simple statute would be better and
that amending the Constitution should only be a last resort.
   Some Democratic senators said there was concern among lawmakers
that opponents of the amendment would find their patriotism under
attack at election time. Others said most Americans were not
worried about the issue.
   Democrats also directed fire at Bush over his support for the
measure.
   ``I would have to be naive if I didn't think his motives have a
political bias,'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark. After the vote, he
predicted, ``the politics will have favored those who voted for
this ill-conceived amendment _ tragic but true.''
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he had heard the theory that
passions have cooled on the flag issue but said they could be
reignited.
   ``Just wait,'' Lott said. He told the Senate that if there were
another high-profile flag-burning incident ``the American people
will rise again.''
   Metzenbaum said the amendment demanded a ``kind of loyalty
(that) is a hallmark of communist countris and right-wing
dictatorships.''
   Rejecting the amendment would be ``saying to the nation that
there is a limit to how shallow our politics can be,'' Metzenbaum
said.

<TEXT>
   Heavy, wet snow falling over the Midwest caused widespread power
outages in Ohio and Indiana today, with Cincinnati, Indianapolis
and St. Louis among the cities setting records for earliest
measurable snowfall.
   Tens of thousands of homes and businesses in Ohio and hundreds
in the Indianapolis area and southern Indiana were blacked out when
snow caused branches to snap onto power lines. Some schools were
closed.
   Three to 5 inches of snow fell overnight in Cincinnati, Dayton
and other areas of southwestern Ohio, according to the National
Weather Service. It was the earliest snowfall in Dayton since 1912.
   The snow followed a drop in temperatures from the upper 70s and
low 80s Monday and Tuesday into the upper 20s and low 30s early
today.
   Two Cincinnati radio stations were knocked off the air
temporarily by the power outages, which affected an estimated
100,000 customers in the area. Up to 3 inches of wet snow that
melted quickly was reported in other areas of Ohio.
   Ohio Edison reported 20,000 customers in the Akron area were
briefly without service this morning, said spokesman Ralph
DiNicola. About 10,000 Columbus Southern Power customers in central
Ohio were without service between 4 and 4:30 a.m., but fewer than
100 remained without power by 8:30 a.m., said spokesman Barrie
Brandt.
   The snow was caused by a low pressure system over the
southeastern United States, combined with a high-level system over
Missouri that pumped arctic air into the Midwest.
   A snow advisory was issued for all of Indiana through tonight.
By midmorning, Richmond, due east of Indianapolis near the Ohio
border, and Hartford City, further north, reported 3 inches of
snow, the weather service said. Weather-watchers in Elwood, just
north of Indianapolis in central Indiana, reported snowfall of 5
inches.
   The heavy flakes stacked up on leafy trees, breaking boughs that
snapped power lines across central Indiana. Several hundred
Indianapolis Power &amp; Light Co. customers were without electricity
because of broken lines this morning after 2 inches of snow fell.
   Hundreds of Public Service Indiana customers were without power
in Bloomington, Martinsville, Greenwood, Columbus, Franklin,
Madison, Connersville and Clarksville, all in southern Indiana. Pam
Chapman, a Public Service Indiana spokeswoman in Plainfield, said
no precise figures of the number of customers affected were
available. She said crews were brought in from unaffected areas to
help restore power.
   The snowfall was the deepest on record in Indianapolis since the
weather service began keeping records in 1885, said meteorologist
John Curran. The previous record of 1.4 inches had stood since 1925.
   Today's snowfall broke a record for the earliest measurable snow
set Oct. 20, 1916, in Indianapolis and in St. Louis, which had
early morning snow flurries.
   Snow also fell over most of Illinois, where warm ground
temperatures kept it from accumulating.
   East-central Illinois was ``getting hit pretty good with snow
this morning,'' said Clint Simpson, a weather service forecaster in
Chicago. ``We would expect the heaviest snow to fall in that area
over the next 24 hours _ 1 to 3 inches, possibly 4 inches.''
   Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday tied its
record for earliest measurable snowfall, set on Oct. 18, 1972.
   Snow also fell in parts of southern Michigan.

<HEAD>Average Retiree's Social Security Check Going Up $25</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Inflation, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's 38.9 million Social Security
beneficiaries can count on a 4.7 percent benefit increase in
January that will boost the average retired worker's pension by $25
a month, the government said Thursday.
   The annual cost-of-living adjustment, the biggest in 7{ years,
will increase the typical benefit check to $566 a month, the Social
Security Administration said.
   For someone who retires at age 65 in 1990, the maximum monthly
benefit will be $975, up from $899 this year.
   The raise, announced after the Labor Department released its
consumer price report for September, mirrors the inflation rate for
urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of
1988 through the same period this year.
   ``Social Security's 39 million beneficiaries, including the
elderly and disabled reliant upon fixed incomes, can rest assured
their buying power will be maintained,'' Social Security
Commissioner Gwendolyn King said in a statement.
   The increase will show up in checks delivered Jan. 3,
representing benefits earned for December.
   The government also announced Thursday that so-called wage base
_ the maximum amount of earnings subject to the payroll tax that
finances Social Security benefits _ will rise from the current
$48,000 to $50,400 next year.
   Only about 10.4 million of the 130 million workers subject to
the payroll tax had earnings that exceeded the wage base this year,
the Social Security Administration said.
   However, all workers and employers face higher payroll taxes
next year, since the tax rate rises from 7.51 percent to 7.65
percent, an increase that was approved by Congress back in 1977.
   The two changes _ higher wage base and higher tax rate _ mean
the maximum tax on employees will jump by $250.80, to $3,855.60, in
1990 for workers earning over $50,400. Employers match their
workers' contributions.
   Tax rates for the self-employed rise from 13.02 percent this
year to 15.30 percent in 1990, when half of the taxes can be
deducted as a business expense. The wage base is the same as for
other workers.
   Next year's benefits increase will be the biggest since a 7.4
percent raise in July 1982, when high inflation rates translated
into bigger cost-of-living adjustments. Benefits rose 4 percent in
1989.
   The Social Security Administration gave the following examples
of how the benefit increase will affect average monthly benefits.
   _Aged couple, both getting benefits: up $43 to $966.
   _Widowed mother and two children: up $53 to $1,173.
   _Aged widow living alone: up $24 to $522.
   _Disabled worker, spouse and children: up $44 to $975.
   _All disabled workers: up $24 to $555.
   Of the 38.9 million people receiving monthly Social Security
benefits, 62 percent are retired workers, 7 percent are disabled
workers and 31 percent are spouses or children of retired, disabled
or deceased workers.
   For the elderly and disabled, the increase in Social Security
benefits will be partially offset by an extra $2 a month in
Medicare premiums, which rise to $33.90 in 1990. The premiums are
deducted directly from Social Security checks.
   The nation's 4.5 million recipients of Supplemental Security
Income, a federal program which provides a minimum income floor for
poor people who are aged, blind or disabled, also will receive a
4.7 percent benefit increase at year's end.
   The maximum SSI payment will rise by $18 to $386 for an
individual, and by $26 to $579 for a couple. The first affected SSI
checks will be delivered Dec. 29.
   Other changes for 1990 announced Thursday include:
   _Beneficiaries aged 65-69 will be able to earn up to $9,360 a
year without losing some or all of their Social Security benefits,
up from $8,880 this year. Congress, meanwhile, is considering
raising the limit even higher.
   _Beneficiaries under 65 will be able to earn $6,840 a year
without penalty, up from $6,480.
   _Workers will need to earn $520 for a quarter of coverage, up
from $500.
   The higher Social Security payments will increase the cost of
benefits by about $11 billion from this year's level of $230
billion. The Treasury will have to spend an added $575 million for
the higher SSI benefits.

<HEAD>Pravda Editor Removed After Gorbachev Attack on Press</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Fixes spelling of hearsay in 5th graf, `The newspaper.' pickup

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief editor of Pravda, the nation's most
authoritative newspaper, was fired today and replaced by a
confidante of Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a week of Kremlin wrangling
over the press took a dramatic new turn.
   An aide said Viktor G. Afanasyev, who has headed the Communist
Party newspaper since the days of Leonid I. Brezhnev, would move to
the Academy of Sciences.
   Sources said Afanasyev's replacement will be Ivan T. Frolov, a
philosopher and former editor of the journal Kommunist who has been
an advisor to Gorbachev for the last year.
   One well-placed Soviet source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the move would give Gorbachev and his reformist
allies control of Pravda, whose circulation is dropping as it lags
behind other newspapers championing franker coverage of national
affairs.
   The newspaper recently suffered an embarrassment when it
published an Italian newspaper's article claiming the popular
Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin boozed and shopped his way
through the United States during a recent speaking tour. A few days
later, Pravda apologized to readers, saying the story was based on
hearsay and could not be substantiated.
   The aide, Vasily P. Popov, said Afanasyev's replacement would be
announced in Friday's editions of Pravda.
   ``Tomorrow you'll read all, that he's going to the Academy of
Sciences,'' Popov said in a telephone interview.
   The replacement of Afanasyev, 66, follows a special party
meeting on the press that appeared to be aimed at reformist rather
than conservatives such as the editor of Pravda. Soviet journalists
said that at the closed-door session Friday, Gorbachev tore into
some of the stars of the glasnost-era media.
   He reportedly called specifically for the resignation of the
editor of the country's most popular newspaper, the weekly
Arguments and Facts, for acting against the party and seeking his
political downfall. The demand triggered a move in the Supreme
Soviet legislature and among the newspaper's workers to defend the
editor.
   The source characterized the attack on the outspoken
practitioners of glasnost as a gesture to party conservatives while
his real goal was to gain control of Pravda.

   Diplomats and thousands of others who work at
the State Department risk ``adverse administration action'' if they
fail to wear identification passes on chains around their necks or
in other ways visible to newly hired guards.
   A recent notice did not specify what punishment might be meted
out to violators, but warned ``keeping the pass in a pocket or
purse or hanging from a belt does not constitute proper wearing of
the pass.''
   The guards, who recently replaced other private guards, are
posted at all building entrances and regularly patrol hallways.
They are dressed in police-like uniforms and carry walkie-talkies
which blare out instructions.
   As in the past, employees will move through turnstiles to enter
or leave the building. Passes are inserted in the turnstiles while
guards stand watch.
   The notice said the purpose of the mandatory pass policy is to
``ensure that there are no unauthorized individuals on the premises
and thus ensure the safety of employees and the protection of
government property.''
   Employees who do not display their passes after Nov. 1 will be
asked to return to their office accompanied by guards to verify
they are valid pass holders, the notice said.
   ``As with other violations of department security procedures,
instances of continued non-compliance by employees may result in
adverse administration action being recommended,'' the notice said.
   The 350-word notice told workers they could pick up neck chains
and clasps for the passes at guard posts.

   Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and
President Bush met today and discussed what Bush called ``the
unique role'' Spain can play in furthering democracy in Eastern
Europe and Latin America.
   Both leaders hailed the 90-minutes of talks as a reaffirmation
of close ties between the two nations.
   Gonzalez also extended to Bush an official invitation from King
Juan Carlos to visit Spain.
   Bush said they reviewed Western efforts to bolster the economies
of Poland and Hungary, communist states struggling to enact
political and economic reforms.
   ``Spain's successful transition to strong and flourishing
democracy makes it a powerful model for Eastern European countries
now attempting similar transformations,'' Bush said in departure
remarks.
   ``In supporting democratic change in Eastern Europe, Latin
America and elsewhere, I am convinced that Spain can play a unique
role, for Spain provides the world with a very special example,''
he said.
   Gonzalez, speaking in Spanish, said that in reviewing the
international situation, including arms control, ``we agreed that
the prospects today are encouraging.''
   ``We also underlined the importance of making the greatest
possible effort in disarmament and arms control talks,'' he said.
   He also expressed sorrow for the victims of Tuesday's earthquake
in California.
   Gonzalez was thought to be carrying fresh proposals for bringing
about an elected government in Panama while allowing Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega to remain in the country. The United States wants
Noriega to relinquish power and stand trial here on drug
trafficking charges.
   American officials said Bush and Gonzalez did not discuss Panama
in their initial talks, but it was expected to come up tonight in
their discussion at a private dinner at the White House.
   Gonzalez believes a solution might be possible if the focus on
Panama shifts away from Noriega's personal fate and emphasizes
instead the transfer of power to an elected government.
   His visit took place 16 days after the failed coup attempt
against Noriega by dissident elements of Panama's Defense Forces.
The administration has been searching for new ideas on how to deal
with Noriega, and officials said they were eager to listen to
Gonzalez.
   The official, who briefed reporters on the condition of
anonymity, said there were some areas of agreement and of
disagreement with Gonzalez's proposal.
   ``The point of agreement is that Noriega ought to get out. What
happens after that _ we have a point of view, and perhaps the prime
minister's got a different point of view, and we'll hear it when
he's here,'' the official said.
   Meanwhile, a published report said the newly appointed top U.S.
military commander in Panama has requested the evacuation of most
dependents of American servicemen stationed there.
   The Washington Times reported in today's editions that unnamed
sources in Panama say Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman raised the subject
with Bush earlier this week at a White House dinner.
   The sources told the newspaper Thurman made the proposal to
evacuate some 3,500 dependents of U.S. military personnel in Panama
to heighten the sense of war among U.S. troops. The Times said the
request is being studied by Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today the
administration is considering whether to accelerate its plan,
ongoing since spring, to get all federally employed civilians and
military dependents either relocated to U.S. bases or home to the
United States.
   He said that as of July 1, 6,300 Defense Department employees
and dependents had either been sent home or relocated on the bases.
   The U.S. population break down in Panama, he said, is 12,500
military personnel, 2,700 Pentagon civilians and 11,000 dependents.
   Under Gonzalez's proposal, outlined to American reporters in
Madrid in recent days, a newly elected president in Panama would
have the power to name a new military commander to replace Noriega,
who would have the option to remain in Panama.
   Bush has held out hope Noriega could be extradited to the United
States to face drug smuggling charges. He has given no serious
consideration to determining whether it would be legally possible
to drop the charges in the interest of promoting democracy in
Panama.

<HEAD>Campaign Gains Reprieve for Egypt's Largest Colony of Egrets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GIZA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nature lovers defending the country's largest
colony of rare egrets persuaded officials to halt an assault on
nesting trees to keep bird droppings from coating parked cars.
   From the birds' point of view, the victory came in the nick of
time: 11 of the huge trees had been ruined, scores of the majestic
birds have died and hundreds of others fled to safer environs.
   For more than a century, thousands of egrets have made their
homes in 99 tall eucalyptuses beside Cairo Zoo and along Sharia
Giza, or Giza Street, a main boulevard in this Cairo suburb.
   Protected by law as an endangered species, the snow-white birds
became a familiar sight. They flew at dawn to distant fields down
the Nile, where they helped farmers control insects, then returned
to their nests as the sun sank over the pyramids in the distance.
   Just as familiar in recent decades have been the cars parked
along Giza Street, usually splattered with bird droppings.
   This summer, owners of luxury apartments overlooking the zoo
complained to authorities about the droppings and demanded action.
   At midnight Oct. 9, the government sent dozens of men with
bulldozers and chain saws. They spent the rest of the night
obliterating the foliage of the first three trees.
   Inadvertantly, they also destroyed parts of the zoo's antique
iron wall and flattened an empty bus stop.
   ``They made preparations as if it was a war,'' said Mohamed
Hussein Amer, the zoo official in charge of birds and animals and
one of several activists who stopped the anti-egret campaign.
   It took two days for telegrams and phone calls to senior
officials and police to halt the massacre. By then, 11 eucalyptus
evergreens had lost all their branches, as many as 200 egrets were
dead, and about 2,000 others fled into the zoo seeking shelter.
   ``It's not just the issue of 11 butchered trees. It's harmful to
Egypt's reputation,'' Amer said.
   ``It was awful _ children running after the birds, the stray
cats eating the small, helpless chicks in their nests. It was
terrible,'' he said.
   Amer estimated 5,000 pairs of egrets live on the 1\-mile stretch
of Giza Street. But Mindy Bahaa el-Din, a zoo employee from
Indianapolis, said a 1987 survey counted 1,604 pairs.
   Mrs. Bahaa el-Din, associated with the British International
Council for Bird Preservation, said because the egrets' breeding
period was unfinished, most of the chicks were too small to fly to
safety.
   ``The first day I saw the damage, I thought a tornado or
hurricane had hit. At least 100 baby egrets were killed,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bahaa el-Din said Giza's governor, Omar Abdel-Akher,
insisted that the governorate had broken no law.
   ``We haven't killed any birds,'' she said Abdel-Akher told her.
``The law bans hunting birds, and we didn't do that.''
   On Tuesday, the newspaper Al-Ahram reported that Environment
Minister Atef Ebeid had ordered Abdel-Akher to stop the
``cleaning-up campaign.''
   Egrets, tall and thin, boast long white plumes, spindly legs and
elongated, slender bills. They have lived in Egypt for thousands of
years, depicted on walls of ancient tombs.
   Although hundreds of thousands once filled Egyptian fields, they
came close to extinction at the turn of the century as plume
hunters shot them down to obtain feathers for hats. A 1912 law
declared egrets a protected species and their colonies rejuvenated,
but farmers using pesticides killed many of them.
   The 99 eucalyptus trees were planted in 1954 alongside trees
where the free-ranging cattle egrets first nested.
   ``The governorate's report says that the tree branches were
being removed because they were old, dying and diseased,'' said
Amer. ``These eucalyptus trees live for up to 450 years, and they
are certainly not diseased.''
   Another governorate administration about 10 years ago tried to
trim the eucalyptus branches to get rid of the egrets, but a public
uproar ended it.
   Despite the temporary pro-bird victory, Mrs. Bahaa el-Din said
she expects the governorate to insist on moving the colony, but in
a more scientific way, so as not to harm the birds, and without
dismembering the trees.
   A Cairo University professor, who passes the zoo every day,
waxed lyrical when asked about the assault on the trees and the
birds:
   ``One day it was like a beautiful woman whose hair was flowing
in the breeze. Yesterday, it was like somebody had shaved her
head.''

   Northern California's experience should be a
warning to Midwesterners to strengthen buildings and plan for
temblors on the New Madrid Fault, which has spawned some of the
strongest U.S. quakes, experts say.
   The quake that rattled the San Francisco Bay area on Tuesday
``has about a 1-in-3 probability of happening on the New Madrid
Fault in the next 10 years,'' said David Stewart of the Center for
Earthquake Studies in Cape Girardeau. ``We can watch what's
happening out there and take a lot of notes.
   ``San Francisco is the best prepared city for an earthquake in
the world. What San Francisco has been doing for a long time is
going to pay off.''
   The California quake, measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale, has
been blamed for an estimated 270 deaths and hundreds of injuries as
well as more than $1 billion in damage to property, bridges,
highways and rail lines.
   The earthquake that devastated Soviet Armenia last December also
had a 6.9 Richter reading, but killed 25,000 people and did $16
billion in damage.
   ``Armenia was an example of absolutely no preparation,'' Stewart
said. ``We're not as bad off as Armenia, but we're certainly not
anywhere near as well prepared as San Francisco was.''
   Quakes are much less frequent on the New Madrid Fault, which
runs from Marked Tree, Ark., into southern Illinois, but scientists
say there is a 40 percent to 63 percent chance of a 6.3 quake by
the year 2000.
   ``The New Madrid Fault is probably the most dangerous fault in
the eastern half of the United States, but there is far more danger
of an earthquake on the San Andreas Fault,'' said Douglass Wiens,
assistant professor of earth and planetary sciences at Washington
University. ``But that's not to say that there's not danger. Just
less.''
   The New Madrid Fault has minor earthquakes registering 3 to 4
``almost daily,'' but the last one above 6.0 was in 1985, said
Brian Mitchell, chairman of the department of earth and atmospheric
sciences at St. Louis University.
   In the summer of 1987, a quake of 4.9 hit along the southern
Illinois-Indiana border, causing minor damage. A series of temblors
that ripped through the New Madrid zone in 1811 and 1812 could be
felt in Boston and Washington but occurred in a largely unpopulated
area and the number of deaths is unknown.
   There was no equipment to measure earthquakes in the 1800s, but
scientists say the New Madrid quakes would probably have been up to
8.7. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 is estimated at 8.3. The
1985 Mexico City quake that killed 10,000 measured 8.1 on the
Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.

<TEXT>
   South Africa's foreign minister held
what he called friendly and constructive talks Thursday with the
South-West Africa People's Organization, the group that has fought
South African rule of the territory for 23 years.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha, on a one-day visit to Namibia, met
with SWAPO and the other nine parties competing in pre-independence
elections planned for Nov. 7-11. No date has been set for
independence, but it is expected early next year.
   Botha said the United Nations-supervised independence process
was on track, but technical matters still needed to be worked out.
He cited Namibia's currency, telecommunications system, and its
participation in a customs union for southern African nations.
   Asked about his meeting with SWAPO leaders, including its
President Sam Nujoma, Botha said it was ``friendly, and I would go
so far as to say constructive.''
   He said South Africa would accept the results of a ``free and
fair election'' and ``was not interested in the ideology or color
of the future government.''
   SWAPO said South Africa was falsely accusing the guerrilla
movement of detaining dissidents and deploying combatants in
southern Angola.
   SWAPO said there was no evidence to support either claim. The
left-leaning organization also accused South Africa of taking
inadequate steps to demobilize Koevoet, a police counterinsurgency
unit active during the guerrillas' independence war.
   A U.N. team that visited Angola and Zambia said they found no
evidence that SWAPO was still holding prisoners, but they could not
account for 315 people.
   A group of U.S. human rights lawyers, the Commission on
Independence for Namibia, last week called for a full accounting of
the missing detainees.
   Relatives of missing people have taken SWAPO to court, trying to
get details on all people held by the organization outside Namibia
since 1980.
   SWAPO said the case is an attempt to embarrass the organization
before the elections. The elections are for an assembly that will
draft a constitution for independent Namibia, which has about 1.3
million people.
   The U.N. independence plan stipulates that a two-thirds majority
within the assembly would be required for adoption of a
constitution.
   But one of the minor parties, the National Patriotic Front, said
SWAPO may be trying to remove the two-thirds requirement because it
fears it won't win such a high percentage.
   Botha said the head of the U.N. monitoring force in Namibia,
Martti Ahtisaari, supported the two-thirds requirement.
   The United Nations will have 1,395 poll watchers monitoring the
elections. Another 500 police supervisors are expected soon, which
would raise the force to 1,500.
   The U.N. Transition Assistance Group in Namibia also consists of
4,650 peacekeepers, and more than 1,500 civilians.
   South Africa, which has ruled the territory since World War I,
signed accords in December with Angola and Cuba agreeing to
independence for Namibia if 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angola
are sent home by mid-1991.

   A black political group charged in a lawsuit
that Tampa's mayor and the county's chief judge conspired to set
high bail to silence activists during a disturbance.
   The United Brothers of the Bay Area wants a federal judge to
declare that Mayor Sandy Freedman and Hillsborough Circuit Judge F.
Dennis Alvarez plotted to deprive five black people of their
constitutional rights.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, seeks $2 million in damages from
the Feb. 2 arrest of the five, who were part of a rowdy rock- and
bottle-throwing crowd in Tampa's racially tense College Hill public
housing development.
   The disturbance erupted following the death of Edgar Allen
Price, a black suspected cocaine dealer who died hogtied in a
police cruiser a night earlier.
   The five St. Petersburg residents were charged with inciting to
riot and unlawful assembly. Four were members of the African
Socalist People's Party.
   It came to light four months later that Freedman, worried the
trouble could escalate, talked with Alvarez from a command post.
   She said she told him Miami rioters had been kept in jail with
high bail in January. Alvarez set bail at $100,000. When one person
was found not to be a member of the group, he was released on
$1,000 bail.
   The other four were held for 36 hours until a different judge
released them without bail. State prosecutors eventually dropped
charges citing lack of evidence.
   United Brothers contends that Freedman and Alvarez had the five
arrested on ``trumped-up'' charges and held under excessive bail in
an attempt to interfere with their right to demonstrate.
   Freedman and Alvarez have denied any wrongdoing.

   While modern science provides better answers
to why earthquakes occur, the human response to these disasters
differs little from that of centuries past.
   ``Praying to God'' was prominent among the answers set forth by
the writer Galesius following tremors in Italy in 1570, and that
was surely the response of many Californians on Tuesday and since
that tremor.
   Galesius also urged ``coming outside during an earthquake,''
which remains good advice, and ``bearing patiently the troubles
that could not be avoided.''
   Two other recommendations from his pen covered strengthening of
buildings to better resist future quakes, though modern building
materials and practices differ from what he had available.
   His final suggestion was placing statues of Saturn and Mercury
at the four corners of buildings.
   Galesius researched quakes that shook the regions around Naples,
Pozzuoli and Ferrara, producing a book that enumerated different
types of shaking and suggested that earthquakes were portents of
even more disasters in the future.
   In his book, Galesius listed the many theories of why
earthquakes occur, including the then-popular concept that they
resulted from ``exhalations'' from inside the Earth.
   Today, scientists describe the movement of giant plates deep in
the earth, with quakes occurring most often along the borders of
those plates where the rocks bind together for a time and then
suddenly slip past one another when the stress becomes strong
enough.
   Ancient scientists and philosophers, however, produced many
theories in an effort to explain the shaking of the ground beneath
their feet. They were able to record the quakes over thousands of
years, and observed that tremors were more common in some areas
than others.
   One of the earliest theories was produced by the Greek writer
Thales who lived at about 580 B.C. He conceived the Earth as a
great vessel floating on the oceans, and thought that movement of
the water caused earthquakes.
   Competing theories were produced by Anaximenes, who thought
giant rocks colliding in the earth's interior caused the temblors.
   Writing between 500 and 428 B.C., Anaxagoras contended that fire
caused earthquakes. He thought that caverns beneath the land were
filled with vapors and when the vapors collided, lightning-like
fire was produced, shaking the land above. The theory was similar
to the one common then that lightning in the air was produced when
clouds collided.
   Also in the fifth century B.C. Archelaus theorized that air
became compressed in underground caverns and eventually the
pressure caused quakes.
   Perhaps the most important of classical writers on earthquakes
was Seneca, who lived from 4 B.C., to 65 A.D. He believed that the
interior of the earth was filled with cold, clammy air which caused
the quakes.
   That theory was repeated by many later writers including Konrad
von Megenberg in the 1300s, who added the possibility that the
stars stirred up these vapors. He also believed that the earthly
vapors caused the Black Plague then sweeping Europe.
   The Venerable Bede, writing in England about 700 A.D., contended
that earthquakes were caused by a large sea beast in the ocean with
its tail wrapped around the world. Similar beast theories have
abounded in other cultures.
   In the 15th century, the writers Agricola and Cardan expounded
on the theory of fires within the Earth, with Cardan emphasizing
the possibility of sulfur and niter causing explosions beneath the
land.
   That theory remained popular for many years, with Nicholas
Lemery contending in the 18th century that the reaction of iron and
sulfur was responsible not only for earthquakes but also volcanoes
and thunderstorms.
   As science began to learn more about nature, electricity became
a possible candidate, with Jean-Claude Delametherie comparing the
earth's crust to the muscles of a fish reacting to the shock of an
electric eel.
   By the 19th century, scientists were learning more about quakes
with John Mitchell of England's Cambridge University discovering
the movement of waves through the Earth's surface and Domenico
Pignatoro of Italy devising an early scale of intensity for quakes.

   A man who spent 6{ years in prison for a murder
and robbery he did not commit has been awarded $1.9 million in
damages by a state Court of Claims.
   Robert McLaughlin, 30, was awarded $1.5 million Wednesday for
``loss of liberty, mental stress, anguish and loss of reputation,''
by Judge Adolph Orlando, settling a lawsuit that was filed three
years ago.
   Orlando also ordered the state to pay the former Brooklyn
resident $225,000 in medical expenses, noting that his prison
experience had contributed to a dependency on drugs and alcohol
that required hospital treatment.
   With amounts awarded for lost of past and future earnings, the
total award was $1,935,000, a record in New York for damages in a
case of unlawful conviction, said civil rights lawyer Richard
Emery, who represented McLaughlin.
   McLaughlin had sought $20 million.
   McLaughlin was convicted in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years for
taking part in an armed robbery of 15 people, one of whom was
killed for resisting.
   The conviction was overturned in 1986 after his foster father,
Jarold Hohne, persuaded Emery and a police lieutenant to get the
court to reinvestigate the case. The only witness who identified
McLaughlin from photographs later acknowledged he was wrong.
   Orlando praised Hohne, saying he ``sought any available
information, left no stone unturned to prove his son's innocence.''
   McLaughlin now works in St. Paul, Minn., as a painter.

<TEXT>
   Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam,
in a defiant response to rebel victories that analysts say could
threaten his government, has called on his nation to unite and
defeat the insurgents.
   In a rare, hour-long speech broadcast nationwide Wednesday,
Mengistu accused the rebel Tigre People's Liberation Front of
rejecting peace overtures and of being ``bent on creating an
immense act of fratricidal war.''
   He said the insurgents also had joined in a ``sinister
conspiracy'' to facilitate the secession of Ethiopia's northernmost
province, Eritrea, which has been the aim of another rebel group.
   Mengistu said it was for the people to decide whether to allow
Eritrea to secede through the ``machinations'' of the TPLF, or to
``defuse the vile conspiracy by mobilizing all the available
resources and score a decisive victory.''
   ``We await the decision of the people,'' Mengistu said.
   Since August, the TPLF is reported to have scored a string of
victories, pushing government troops out of the rebels' Tigre
province south into the heart of neighboring Wollo province and to
within 155 miles of the capital, Addis Ababa.
   Diplomats say the offensive presents a strong challenge to
Mengistu's Marxist government, weakened by a bloody attempted coup
in May, waning Soviet support and one of the world's poorest
economies.
   The rebels' southern progress appeared to have included the
taking of Dese, Wollo's regional capital, over the weekend, with
government troops and bureaucrats fleeing without a shot being
fired.
   But Western diplomats said the rebels did not occupy the key
city and that, backed by hundreds of reinforcements, government
troops and personnel started returning to Dese on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
   Foreign aid agencies have pulled a dozen or so expatriate relief
workers from Dese back to Addis Ababa, apparently indefinitely, as
they monitor the military situation, said the diplomats, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The diplomats said there appeared to be a lull in the fighting
with the rebels hiding in the hills around Dese and the government
using the time to bring in reinforcements from the Eritrean capital
of Asmara.
   One of Mengistu's problems in slowing the rebels' advance has
been his demoralized army, observers said. After decades of
fighting, the force is principally made up of poorly paid young
conscripts with little training.
   ``I think above all what Mengistu needs in Dese is quality _
some trained troops who have proven their ability and their
loyalty,'' said one of the diplomats, who described the forces from
Asmara as just that.
   They were instrumental in putting down a May coup attempt that
saw more than a dozen generals slain and more than 100 other senior
officers jailed.
   Mengistu characterized the rebels as ``treacherous bandits'' who
were ``biting our hand stretched out in peace.''
   In June, Mengistu offered to engage in unconditional peace
negotatiations in the presence of an international observer with
the rebel groups, and the first round of peace talks between the
government and the Eritreans took place last month in Atlanta. A
second round of talks is scheduled to begin Nov. 18 in Nairobi.
   The TPLF in July and August broadcast statements indicating it
was willing to engage in negotiations and Tuesday said it had
agreed on the ``basic idea'' of holding peace talks after a
monthlong series of meetings in London with government
representatives.
   Diplomats, however, who spoke by telephone from Ethiopia's
capital, were wary of the rebels' statement.
   ``I think the TPLF is engaged in a strategy to build wedges and
cracks in this government,'' said one. ``Any talks should be seen
in this light.''
   The TPLF took up arms in 1974 seeking greater autonomy for the
province of Tigre and Mengistu's ouster. The secessionist Eritrean
rebels have been fighting since 1962 in Africa's oldest civil war.

   Vice President Dan Quayle briefed President
Bush today on the California earthquake and declared the federal
government would ``put the maximum that we can'' behind the relief
effort. But members of Congress said the emergency funds would fall
short of what was needed.
   Bush said he would fly to the San Francisco Bay area Friday for
a personal inspection of the damage. White House officials said the
president would spend about three hours in the area.
   Quayle and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner were in the
quake area on Wednesday and told Bush what they had seen and how
federal relief efforts were progressing.
   ``All federal resources have been marshaled,'' Skinner said in
an appearance on the ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program.
``The coordination in California is excellent. I spoke to the
governor and all his requests are being met.''
   Quayle was asked on the NBC-TV ``Today'' show if there was
enough money available for the relief effort. He replied, ``We will
put the maximum that we can behind that, working with state and
local levels of government to clean the situation up.''
   Quayle brushed off criticism from San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos
who said he was ``ticked off'' that the vice president did not meet
with him during his tour of the area.
   ``We invited all the mayors to come and sit down with us,'' said
Quayle. ``I think it's very unfortunate to take that kind of a shot
at a very difficult time.''
   Agnos, a Democrat, said Quayle ``flies around in a helicopter,
makes a bunch of television spots. ... I have real questions about
what he was doing here. It may have been just a publicity stunt.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today that not
only was Agnos invited to two meetings Quayle held, the White House
offered to ``send a helicopter to pick him up wherever he was and
deliver him to the meetings, and he declined that.''
   He said Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, has tried to call
Agnos for several days, and ``he declined to talk to us. We regret
very muth that the mayor of San Francisco has declined not to
cooperate with us in this matter in making sure there is adequate
federal support for the disaster in his city.''
   The White House said an initial $273 million will be available
for the area from a pool of $1.1 billion that Congress appropriated
after the devastation caused by Hurricane Hugo.
   But Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., a member of the House
Appropriations Committee, said $1.1 billion isn't enough. The Bush
administration will have to cooperate to find more money, he said.
   ``I want to do whatever it would take to make those dollars
available,'' he said. ``No question we would want to take them
(funds) out of existing programs.''
   The day after Tuesday's earthquake, Bush visited the
headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the office
responsible for coordinating 25 departments brought in to handle
the disaster.
   ``Words can't adequately convey our sentiments, I know, but I
can say that we will take every step and make every effort to help
the Bay area in its hours of need,'' Bush said.
   Quayle said he discussed the importance of preparation with Bush
by telephone from Air Force Two on his way back to Washington from
inspecting the damage in San Francisco.
   ``It could have been much worse if we had not had that
preparation,'' Quayle told reporters at Andrews Air Force Base near
Washington. ``I do believe it's under control and we are making
progress.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, meantime, activated military
support. Military hospitals opened their doors to civilians, and
the Defense Department moved people and equipment into the area.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said 1,173 California National
Guardsmen have been called up to help in quake recovery operations,
but he could now say how many active duty military personnel have
helped, since most of their efforts have been ``so impromptu and ad
hoc.''
   Williams said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has begun
inspecting federal dams and levees and, at the request of the state
government, state and private dams. So far, he said, no damage has
been reported for structures inspected within 50 miles of the
epicenter.
   Also, a U-2 reconnaissance plane from Beale Air Force Base
overflew the San Francisco area late Wednesday and FEMA officials
in California will be given the pictures. Williams said the photos
could be used to detect problems in structures.
   Two hundred Navy Seabees, specialists in disaster recovery,
headed to the area equipped with backhoes, trench diggers and water
storage equipment to repair water and sewer lines.
   Heavy lift equipment from the Naval Air Station at Alameda,
Calif., was sent to remove debris from a collapsed section of
Interstate 880 in Oakland, where some 250 people were feared dead.
   A C-141 was to transport about 27,000 pounds of FEMA equipment
and 12 people from Shepard Field, W.Va., to California.
   FEMA, which set up a temporary headquarters in dontown San
Francisco, prepared to open a permanent office as well as satellite
offices in the seven counties where officials will process aid
applications. The smaller offices may begin operating in a few days.
   Federal assistance can include temporary housing, grants of up
to $10,000 per family and low-cost loans to cover uninsured private
and business property losses.
   The American Red Cross operated temporary shelters for people
left homeless by the earthquake. Even the Internal Revenue Service
came to the aid of residents, volunteering to forgive penalties on
late tax returns or payments.

   The tale of Oscar the fish, Orange
County's earthquake prophet, took another curious turn this week:
The one-eyed denizen of the deep was sequestered due to death
threats.
   Four hours after Tuesday's San Francisco Bay area quake, Oscar
was doing the sidestroke _ the same pre-temblor behavior that
brought the 10-inch fish notoriety as a quake prognosticator.
   Oscar may have been swimming on his side moments before the Bay
area quake, but no one was around to see.
   Observers insist the South American red oscar, which usually
lives in an aquarium in Corona del Mar High School's biology lab,
has rolled over and predicted 15 to 20 Southern California quakes
in three years.
   But recent publicity surrounding his talents spawned a series of
death threats. Fearing Oscar might be ``deep-sixed,'' Principal Tom
Jacobson said the famous fish was taken to an undisclosed location
two weeks ago.
   So Oscar was alone during Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude quake, said
biology teacher Ron Schnitger. But Schnitger visited the fish hours
later, he saw another unusual occurrence.
   ``He was sleeping on his side, and I've never seen that happen,
sleeping with his good eye down,'' said Schnitger, explaining fish
usually sleep the same way they swim.

   ``I think I'm loud and weird,'' Roberts said in the November
issue of Cosmopolitan. ``But if you're a real person, people can't

   She said she believes in speaking her mind.
   ``I find myself becoming more open and honest,'' she said.
``Still, I know that's a great risk to take. But I've found that if
I say what I'm feeling, 90 percent of the time it can be worked
out.''
   Roberts, 23, whose brother is actor Eric Roberts, names her

   Roberts is known for her role as Daisy Araujo in last year's

   The screenwriter of hit films such as
``Flashdance'' and ``Jagged Edge'' accused the president of a
powerful Hollywood talent agency with threatening to ruin his
career, according to a published report.
   Joe Eszterhas says that Michael Ovitz, head of Creative Artist
Agency, threatened to damage Eszterhas' reputation in the film
industry if he left the agency, the Los Angeles Times reported
Thursday. Ovitz denied the allegation.
   ``What you were threatening me with was a twisted new version of
the old-fashioned blacklist,'' Eszterhas wrote Ovitz in an Oct. 3
letter quoted in the Times. ``Plain and simple, cutting out all
smiles and friendliness, it's blackmail.''
   In response, CAA released a letter Ovitz wrote to Eszterhas to
deny the allegations.
   ``When I received your letter this morning, I was totally
shocked, since my recollection of our conversation bore no
relationship to your recollection,'' Ovitz wrote.
   The Times said the four-page Eszterhas letter had circulated
throughout the Hollywood community, which for years had speculated
that the agency put pressure on people who wanted to switch agents.
The newspaper did not specify where it got a copy of the letter.
   Ovitz would not comment further on the letters or the charges,
but CAA agent Ray Kurtzman issued a statement to the press, calling
Eszterhas ``a very talented writer'' who had every right to change
agencies and was not threatened when he did so.
   Ovitz has become a ``super agent'' in the industry, using an
extensive client list to exert influence over projects. Some
believe Ovitz does have the power to break even established
careers, the Times reported.

   More than half of the students at Metamora
High School students are boycotting the lunch program because the
school board decided to offer only a pro-nutrition, no ``junk
food'' menu.
   The rebellion is hitting the school financially. And the
students are getting backing from a local radio station and a major
corporation _ which is offering free Twinkies.
   Particularly rankling to students has been the administration's
recent ban on the sale of soda and candy during lunch at the
Student Council Store. That has put a significant dent in the
Student Council's fund raising, cutting projected annual revenue
from $35,000 to $6,000.
   Protesting students have been bringing bag lunches for over a
week instead of paying $1.25 for the school's hot lunch. Business
has dropped in the cafeteria from 550 students daily to about 250.
   ``Students are old enough to choose what they want to eat,''
said Student Council President Stephanie Smith, a proud brown
bagger.
   ``We just want to get the candy and sodas back,'' said Brent
Rohman, the unofficial leader of the rebellion, who also lobbied
for _ and won _ a salad bar and milk shake machine for the
cafeteria last year. ``Kids get addicted to it, almost.''
   Superintendent Ken Maurer, who claims to admire the students'
stand of passive resistance, says he has no intention of feeding
that addiction, even if it means running a deficit in the lunch
program.
   Radio station WMBD and the Continental Baking Co., based in St.
Louis, will sponsor a promotion Tuesday offering the company's
Hostess Twinkies free to anyone inclined to indulge.
   ``We obviously do not disagree with the school board's point of
view that nutrition should be stressed,'' said Continental Baking
spokesman Pat Farrell. ``But we all know kids are not going to eat
just spinach, pasta and high protein. To each life a little
enjoyment. That's what Hostess cake products are all about.''
   Maurer responds by eating granola bars, running three miles a
day, and lecturing on the benefits of exercise and a proper diet.
   ``You are what you eat,'' he said. ``Do you want to look like
Roseanne Barr or Jane Fonda? John Candy or Tom Selleck?''

   The conservative editor of the Communist Party
daily Pravda, the country's most authoritative newspaper that has
lagged behind glasnost, was removed Thursday and replaced by a
confidant of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   It was the most dramatic development in a week of Kremlin
wrangling about the state-run press that focused new attention on
the information explosion spawned by Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or greater openness.
   The departure of Pravda chief editor Viktor G. Afanasyev,
announced by the official news agency Tass and state-run TV, also
marks a further attempt by Gorbachev to clean house of
conservatives in high positions.
   Last month, three conservatives on the ruling Politburo were
retired.
   The Pravda editorship is seen as an important position.
Afanasyev was allowed to sit in on closed meetings of the Politburo
and is a member of the party's policy-making Central Committee and
Ideological Commission.
   Tass said Afanasyev, who has headed the party newspaper since
the era of former Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev _ now condemned
as a period of stagnation _ would be moving to ``scientific work.''
   It said said Afanasyev's replacement is Ivan T. Frolov, a
philosopher and former editor of the party's theoretical monthly
journal Kommunist, who has been an adviser to Gorbachev for the
last year.
   A well-placed source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the move would give Gorbachev and his reformist allies control of
Pravda.
   Pravda, which means ``truth'' and blares the Marxist appeal
``Workers of the World, Unite!'' atop page one, is still the place
to seek texts of official speeches and articles about Kremlin
policy.
   But its circulation, now 9.6 million, is falling as it lags
behind other newspapers championing franker coverage of national
and international affairs.
   Many Soviets turn instead to publications such as Arguments and
Facts and Ogonyok, which are filled with breezily written
criticisms of the system. The Arguments and Facts weekly has a
circulation of 26 million, more than double last year's figure, and
is the country's most popular newspaper.
   Pravda last month suffered an embarrassment when it reprinted an
Italian newspaper's article claiming popular Communist maverick
Boris N. Yeltsin boozed and shopped his way through the United
States during a recent speaking tour.
   A few days later, Pravda apologized, saying the story could not
be substantiated.
   Afansyev aide Vasily P. Popov said Afanasyev's replacement will
be announced in Friday's editions of Pravda.
   ``Tomorrow you'll read all, that he's going to the Academy of
Sciences,'' Popov said in an interview.
   The replacement of Afanasyev, 66, followed a special party
meeting on the press that appeared to be aimed at reformers rather
than conservatives like the Pravda editor. Soviet journalists said
that at the closed-door session Friday, Gorbachev tore into some of
the stars of glasnost.
   The Kremlin chief reportedly called specifically for the
resignation of the editor of Arguments and Facts, Vladislav A.
Starkov.
   Soviet lawmakers, the weekly newspaper's workers and an
international organization, The Committee to Protect Journalists,
rallied to defend the editor.
   In an interpretation of Gorbachev's tactics, the well-placed
source characterized the attack on the outspoken practitioners of
glasnost as a gesture to party conservatives, while the real goal
was to gain control of Pravda.
   Another Soviet observer said Gorbachev was taking a middle
course by trying to get rid of one editor who has angered
conservatives and another widely viewed as an obstacle to reform.
   On Thursday, members of Starkov's staff said they had formed a
work committee and elected him head in a bid to protect him from
being fired. The staff members, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the publisher of Arguments and Facts, the Znaniye public
lecture society, also supports Starkov.
   Afanasyev has been Pravda editor since 1976. In addition to his
party posts is head of the official Union of Journalists. Although
he has spoken out for glasnost, Afanasyev is closely identified
with the Brezhnev era, when the press helped hide the country's
problems. He favors keeping government processes under strong party
supervision, rejects political pluralism and has warned against
allowing criticism of party policy to go too far.
   Last summer, a deputy to a nationwide party conference listed
Afanasyev as among four top officials who ``actively pursued the
policy of stagnation'' and should be fired. Of the others _ Mikhail
S. Solomentsev, Andrei A. Gromyko and Georgy A. Arbatov _ only
Arbatov, head of a Kremlin think tank on the United States, still
has his job.
   Popov said Afanasyev has wanted for some time to devote his
attention more fully to the Academy of Sciences, where he is a
member of the section on philosophy and law, and asked to leave
Pravda.
   Frolov, 60, headed Kommunist, the Central Committee's
theoretical and political journal, until 1987 and is credited with
formulating Gorbachev's foreign policy that places priority on
fostering values common to all mankind, rather than encouraging
class struggle.
   Like Afanasyev, Frolov is a full member of the Central Committee
and its Ideological Commission, and a member of the Academy of
Sciences' Philosophy and Law department.

<HEAD>Report: Millions of Children Threatened by Lack of Health Care</HEAD>

   About 8 million poor children are being shut
out of Medicaid, threatening their health and leaving them
vulnerable to chronic and disabling conditions later in life, a
children's hospital association said Thursday.
   ``Skimping on Medicaid for children is shortsighted public
policy,'' said Robert H. Sweeney, president of the National
Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions.
   Medical care denied poor children now can result in larger
expenses in later years when they need treatment for illnesses and
conditions that could have been prevented with proper care in the
early years, he said.
   But a report released by the association said poor children are
being forgotten as state governments balance their budgets by
chipping away at Medicaid benefits and tightening eligibility to
limit enrollment in their programs.
   The result, the report said, is that nearly half of the nation's
children living under the federal poverty level are not served by
the federal-state health-care program for the poor.
   ``Why must children be the ones excluded in this spasm of fiscal
integrity?'' asked Sweeney. ``They'll be paying off this deficit
for years to come _ shouldn't they get some of the benefits, now,
to ensure that they're healthy enough to suport this
responsibility?''
   Jon E. Vice, chairman of the association and president of
Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, said that ``after 25 years of
public neglect, Medicaid is nothing short of Uncle Sam's poor
stepchild.''
   The association called for reforms that would ensure coverage
for all children and pregnant women to 185 percent of the federal
poverty level, allow those with higher incomes to buy into Medicaid
and expand benefits for eligible children.
   The group also said physician reimbursements should be raised to
ensure that beneficiaries have access to care and enrollment
procedures should be eased.
   The changes would cost the federal government and the states $10
billion and would add coverage for 7.5 million of the nation's
estimated 11 million uninsured children. In fiscal 1988, the
federal government spent $30 billion and the states spent $20
billion on Medicaid.
   The report said Medicaid coverage is denied to an estimated 8
million poor children.
   Income limits vary from state to state. This year, an average
income of $407 per month _ about 48 percent of the federal poverty
level _ disqualifies a family of three from Medicaid, the report
said. In Alabama, the limit for a family of three is $118 per
month. Ten states deny Medicaid coverage to children who live with
two parents, regardless of income.
   Many children who are eligible don't receive benefits because
parents are unable to complete the complicated application and
documentation forms, the report said.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Say U.S. Blocking Antarctica Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists on Thursday accused the United
States of leading an assault that has blocked agreement at an
international meeting on the future of Antarctica and hopes of
protecting the icy continent.
   Dominating debate at the two-week meeting of 39 nations that
ends Friday is the issue of mining: whether the vast continent
should be left a beautiful unspoiled wilderness or exploited for
its potential mineral wealths.
   French oceanographer and explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, who
collected 1.5 million signatures on a petition favoring an
Antarctic wilderness preserve, accused Washington officials of
``wasting their time defending a lost cause.''
   The United States, Britain and New Zealand want a meeting to
work out details of accident liability under an international
minerals convention that would open Antarctica to regulated mining
and replace the existing voluntary moratorium on mining.
   The convention, worked out after six years of tough negotiation,
was initialed in June 1988 in Wellington, New Zealand.
   The United States says the convention is the best way to protect
Antarctica, and a member of the U.S. delegation who spoke on
condition of anonymity said negotiations were proceeding smoothly.
   ``Nobody here wants to go home without an agreement,'' he said.
   But Australia and France say mining and environmental protection
are like oil and icy waters _ they don't mix. Both countries have
refused to sign the mineral convention, effectively stopping it,
and they have been joined in the last few weeks by Italy, Belgium,
India, Greece, Austria and Bulgaria.
   Australia and France want a meeting dedicated to discussing an
ambitious proposal to declare Antarctica a ``wilderness park''
where mining would be prohibited and human activity carefully
controlled.
   ``The meeting has made very little progress since the United
States, the U.K. and a couple of others had refused to stop pushing
the minerals convention,'' said an environmentalist with observer
status to the conference. ``We could end up without any agreement
at all. It would be tragic.''
   The minerals convention does not assign responsiblity for
cleaning up and paying damages in the event of accident.
   The Argentine ship Bahia Paraiso ran around and sank near the
U.S. Palmer Station in January, spilling 70,000 gallons of diesel
fuel into one of the most delicate ecosystems in the world.
Argentina, Chile and the United States cooperated on the cleanup,
but the ship continues to leak.
   To date, no one has assumed responsiblity for plugging the leak,
or for the damage done to 22 years of American research measuring
Antarctica's unpolluted environment against global pollution levels.
   Delegates at the 15th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting also
were busy hammering out compromises on rules governing waste
disposal and specially protected areas.

   Despite dramatic rescues, authorities had
little hope today that more survivors could be extricated from
between massive slabs of concrete sandwiched together on Interstate
880.
   An army of construction workers maneuvered cranes around the
fallen, 18-block section of the elevated double-decker freeway
while rescuers used dogs and electronic sensors to search for signs
of life.
   Wood-and-pipe supports were placed under rubble along a portion
of the collapsed freeway so workers could safely map the locations
and conditions of smashed cars, police Sgt. Alan White said today.
It will take several days to place hundreds of supports, and the
mapping can't be completed until then.
   As darkness fell Wednesday, police Capt. Jim Hahn said no one
had been recovered during the day and he doubted there were more
survivors.
   More than 250 rush-hour commuters were feared crushed to death
between the decks of I-880, the Nimitz Freeway, which collapsed
during Tuesday's quake.
   The search was moving ``slowly and meticulously'' because the
highway was like ``a house of cards'' that could flatten at any
moment, said Kyle Nelson of the California Department of
Transportation.
   Mayor Lionel Wilson was telling reporters Wednesday evening that
the search had found no survivors when police Lt. Kristina Wraa
interrupted to say one had been discovered. Hahn later dismissed
the report as garbled communication.
   Tuesday night, rescuers were able to pull one man alive from a
car crushed to a height of 18 inches, said passerby Patrick
MacIntyre, and emergency workers pulled a girl from the wreckage of
another automobile.
   In perhaps the most dramatic, ghastly rescue, doctors freed a
6-year-old from a car after firefighters cut through the body of
the child's dead mother.
   Dr. Jim Betts, lying on his stomach in the car crushed between
the decks, was forced to amputate the boy's right leg, while
firefighters struggled to contain blazes that consumed vehicles on
either side of the car.
   ``It was appalling. It was terrible,'' said Dr. Jack Ellis, one
of two other surgeons working with Betts. ``We're used to having
them brought to the hospital, not doing surgery under a concrete
beam.''
   The child, Julio Berumen, was in critical condition Wednesday at
Children's Hospital.
   The child's mother and another adult in the car were killed when
a pillar of the highway sliced through the vehicle during the
temblor, said fire Capt. Ron Carter.
   Gov. George Deukmejian speculated the highway collapse was the
result of substandard construction. He called for an investigation.
State transportation officials said the freeway, one of the area's
oldest, had been reinforced and was considered earthquake-safe.
   Some years back bumper stickers reading, ``Pray for Me, I Drive
the Nimitz,'' appeared in the East Bay, but were presumed to deal
more with the highway's narrow lanes and concrete barriers than the
threat of earthquake damage.
   During Tuesday evening's rush hour, screams and the crash of
metal brought residents of the surrounding neighborhood in
impoverished West Oakland to the scene.
   ``They climbed up on the bridge to take people off. They lined
up to volunteer. They established medical help as soon as
possible,'' Police Lt. Larry Eade said. ``I didn't see one instance
of a citizen that didn't cooperate.''
   Dorothy Otto said she was driving on the lower deck when the
quake hit.
   ``Suddenly the road started to bounce,'' she said. ``The cars
were like ping pong balls. They were bouncing.''
   I-880 was built in 1957 and was reinforced in 1977 in the first
part of a three-phase anti-earthquake program, Department of
Transportation officials said. In the work, the road deck was tied
to its supporting columns.
   The columns themselves collapsed, and the deck did not slip off
the columns, transportation department chief engineer Bill Schaefer
said in Sacramento.
   Further work to strengthen the road against earthquakes had been
deferred pending an engineering study, Schaefer said.
   Asked whether the freeway had been considered safe from
earthquakes, Schaefer said, ``there's no such thing as an
earthquake-proof structure,'' but added he was shocked by the
collapse.
   ``We thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake
we could have in this area, anything that would happen in this
area,'' he told reporters.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert
A. Mosbacher said Thursday that Soviet bloc nations must boldly
commit themselves to free market economies if they want to solve
their dire financial problems.
   ``Our hope is to see the Soviet Union and all the countries of
Eastern Europe fully integrated into the community of nations, with
their citizens enjoying the benefits of free enterprise,''
Mosbacher said.
   Mosbacher was in Frankfurt for a conference sponsored by the
Institute for East-West Security Studies. His remarks came in a
speech prepared for delivery Thursday evening.
   The commerce secretary said that much work is necessary before
East bloc nations that strengthen their economies.
   ``There is no escaping the fact that the East's economic
problems were home-grown, and they can only be solved at home by
radical _ and genuine change,'' he said.
   Mosbacher added: ``Only the market place, only free enterprise,
can solve the desperate economic problems of the Eastern
countries.''
   The Bush administration official said the leaders of Hungary and
Poland are committed to working for a market economy, while ``each
day Soviet leaders come closer.
   ``The leaders of the other Eastern economies, though, are still
living in the past,'' he asserted.
   Communist East German leaders, including new party chief Egon
Krenz, have called for a strengthening of an orthodox socialist
structure. East Germany has an economy that is the envy of many of
its Soviet bloc neighbors.
   Mosbacher also addressed the critical question of financing
changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``Competition in production alone is not enough,'' he said.
``Independent banks are essential, allocating capital on the basis
of markets and interest rates and offering financial services that
we in the West take for granted.''
   Mosbacher, 62, also referred to his own background as a
multimillionaire oil company executive.
   ``As a businessman, I'm not accustomed to couching my views in
the language of euphemism. I prefer to speak forthrightly,'' said
Mosbacher. ``And I'll say what we all know: Marxist economics do
not work.''
   Among the topics at the East-West security conference Mosbacher
was attending is the integration of the ``reforming socialist
countries into the world economy.'' Other topics include arms
reduction and international cooperation.
   West German Foreign Minister-Hans Dietrich Genscher and Italian
Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis were among the approximately
200 participants.

<HEAD>Regulators Deny Request to Delay Low-Power License</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Thursday
turned down a citizen group's request to delay issuing a low-power
testing license for the Comanche Peak nuclear power plant in Texas.
   The request by Citizens for Fair Utility Regulation came just
days after the NRC opened an internal investigation into
allegations by an anonymous group of NRC inspectors that senior
agency officials had covered up problems at Comanche Peak.
   The anonymous inspectors, in a letter to commission Chairman
Kenneth Carr on Oct. 4, said Comanche Peak, operated by Texas
Utilities Electric Co., was far from being ready to safely begin
low-power testing.
   The commission has not said when it would issue a low-power
license, but staff members indicated Thursday it would be at least
a few weeks.
   Betty Brink, a leader of the citizens group, said that as a
result of the NRC's refusal to put Comanche Peak's low-power
license application on hold her organization would go to the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans next week.
   The plant is situated near Glen Rose, Texas, about 40 miles
southwest of Fort Worth.
   The group's main argument is that Comanche Peak should not be
allowed to fire up the reactor until the courts rule on the group's
existing suit seeking to force a licensing rehearing. The hearing
process was officially closed in July 1988.
   Mrs. Brink said her group believed that the plant was not ready
to operate safely and that even low-power operation would put area
residents at undue risk.
   In denying the group's request, the commission said it was a
matter for the courts to decide because the commission previously
had ruled that the group had no legal standing to intervene in the
late stages of the licensing hearings.
   The commission added, however, that it was ordering its staff to
look into the group's charges of possible safety hazards associated
with low-power operation of the plant.
   The owner of Comanche Peak, Texas Utilities Electric Co., told
the commission Thursday it expected to be ready to request
permission to load fuel and start low-power testing early next
month, although it gave no exact target date.
   Erle Nye, chairman of the utility, said, ``I am confident that
Comanche Peak has been built safely.''

<HEAD>Study: Decade of Effort Brings $450 Million in Pay Equity Adjustments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade of lobbying for pay equity has
brought women and minorities in the public sector more than $450
million in wage and salary gains, according to a survey released
Thursday.
   The prospects for achieving further pay increases for women and
minorities in the 1990s are bright, the study and its sponsors
said, because of the attention focused on the issue and because
those groups will represent the majority of new entrants in the job
market.
   ``What the 1980s have done is establish pay equity as a viable
way to end wage discrimination,'' said Claudia E. Wayne, executive
director of the National Committee on Pay Equity. ``We have made
inroads and now in the 1990s we will move forward by focusing on
grass-roots education, legislation, litigation, collective
bargaining and other means of making additional progress.''
   The committee's study, a compilation of the results of state and
local pay-equity drives since 1979, found that all but five states
have studied whether their pay scales are fair to women. Also
launching such studies were scores of city, county and local
governments and nearly 200 public colleges and universities, the
report said.
   As a result, 20 state governments have negotiated pay increases
totaling more than $382 million in the past 10 years and cities,
counties and school districts have raised salaries more than $72
million, according to the study.
   ``A decade-long movement for pay equity has resulted in bankable
justice for tens of thousands of public workers,'' said Wayne. In
the jurisdictions that made made pay adjustments, the costs have
averaged between 2 percent and 5 percent of total payroll, she said.
   Census Bureau data for both public and private sector workers
shows that in 1988, the average annual pay of women was $17,606, or
66 percent of the $26,656 average for men. In 1979, women made 59
percent the amount made by men.
   The Census statistics show black men averaged 74.8 percent of
the wages paid white men last year while Hispanic men on average
were paid 65.5 percent of what white men were paid.
   White women were paid an average annual salary of $17,851 last
year, 65.4 percent of the $27,228 paid white men, the Census
figures showed. Black women and Hispanic women were paid 60.7
percent and 54.5 percent, respectively, of the totals for white men.
   The committee's study was most encouraging for women, showing
that every state except Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia and
Idaho had studied or were studying how women in the state work
force are paid. But only three states have expanded those reviews
to study whether minorities receive comparable pay _ New York, New
Jersey and Wisconsin.
   ``The tackling of race-based wage discrimination problems has
come just recently,'' Wayne said. ``I think that more and more in
the future those who are tracking the issue will look at both race
and sex.''
   Many states that have studied pay equity have yet to implement a
plan to correct any discrimination, the report said, suggesting
that advocates of pay equity _ also often referred to as comparable
pay _ still face a daunting task, particularly in states with
fiscal problems.
   To help overcome such obstacles, Wayne said unions, which
represent a majority of public-sector workers, are in most cases
not seeking back pay adjustments and are willing to receive pay
improvements for women and minorities through incremental steps.
   She said the committee had no solid data on pay equity in
private businesses but said corporate leaders contacted by the
organization ``are of the opinion that pay equity makes good
business sense.''

<HEAD>Britain, Argentina Agree to Normalize Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO CONDE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina and Britain agreed Thursday to
resume normal diplomatic and economic relations seven years after
they fought a war over the Falkland Islands.
   A joint communique read in Spanish and English by Argentine
Ambassador Lucio Garcia del Solar and British United Nations
Ambassador Crispin Tickell said both governments noted that all
hostilities had ceased.
   The announcement followed two days of meetings, the first held
between Britain and Argentina since Buenos Aires surrendered to a
British task force on June 14, 1982, after invading the windswept
South Atlantic archipelago.
   The 74 days of fighting, during which neither side formally
declared war, left 1,000 dead.
   ``Today we've taken a very large step towards normalization of
relations,'' Tickell said. ``But we're not there yet.''
   The agreement includes re-establishment of consular relations at
the consul general level in London and Buenos Aires ``to be
announced at an early date.'' Garcia del Solar said that date ``was
not too far off.''
   The agreement to resume consular ties is a precondition to the
establishment of full diplomatic relations.
   Spanish sources had described Argentina as being ``more in a
hurry'' than Britain to come to an agreement because of the Latin
American nation's pressing need to normalize economic relations
with London and desire to establish closer ties with the 12-member
European Economic Community.
   The Madrid talks were announced at the United Nations Aug. 18.
They were made possible after Argentine President Carlos Menem, who
took office in July, agreed to drop the insistence of his
predecessors that Argentina's claim to the islands, which it calls
the Malvinas, had to be the first issue considered in any
discussion of normalization.
   Tickell said there had been no discussion of the reduction of
the 2,000-man British military contingent in the 200-island
archipelago off the southern tip of Argentina, a move the
Argentines reportedly favored.
   ``I think you can assume there will be no change,'' Tickell said.
   ``It remains one of the priorities of the British government to
protect the security of the islands,'' he said, adding the
maintenance of the British military presence remains important to
that end.
   The two countries also agreed to:
   _ resume air and maritime communications following negotiations
by competent authorities;
   _ lift all remaining commercial and financial restrictions and
restrictive practices imposed since 1982;
   _ not pursue any claim against the other, including nationals of
the other, in respect of loss or damage from hostilities and
actions in and around the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the
South Sandwich Islands;
   _ exchange views and proposals about measures to build
confidence and avoid tension;
   _ exchange views on contacts between the islands and the
continental mainland;
   _ renew normal cultural, scientific and sporting exchanges; and
   _ hold the next substantive meeting in Madrid Feb. 14-15.
   For its part, Britain said it would send a trade mission to
Buenos Aires Nov. 27 to Dec. 1, make available short-term credit
cover for British exports under irrevocable letters of credit from
Argentine banks and facilitate cooperative links between Argentina
and the 12 member nations of the European Economic Community.
   Britain also said it agreed to allow Argentine merchant ships to
enter the 150-mile zone of exclusion around the islands and to
align the limits of the zone with those of a zone designed to
protect the islands' fishing resources.
   Both countries also agreed to an umbrella clause that protects
their respective claims to sovereignty over the islands, which are
inhabited by 1,800 people, most of whom are descended from British
sailors in the 19th century.
   Argentine claims to the islands are based on the 1494 Treaty of
Tordesillas by which Spain and Portugal settled conflicts over land
claimed in the New World and on Spanish possession, to which
Argentina succeeded after declaring independence from Spain in 1816.
   British claims are based on continuous and effective occupation
since 1833.

<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled
unanimously Thursday that the financial troubles facing the
Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant have no impact on whether the
plant receives a full-power license.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon, opposing the
license, said he will appeal the ruling in federal court. Seabrook
officials say the plant could receive a full-power license by the
end of the year.
   The NRC rejected Shannon's argument that Public Service Company
of New Hampshire, which owns the largest share of Seabrook, and 11
other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant's safe
operation. Shannon was seeking a waiver of an NRC policy that
ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions.
   In its ruling, the NRC said that because Seabrook will be
allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make
payments on past construction costs, consideration of the owners'
financial condition is pointless.
   ``The commissioners found the circumstances of the case didn't
undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available
funds adequate for safe operation,'' said commission spokesman John
Kopeck. ``The commission also said that it hasn't been shown any
other significant link between the applicants' financial condition
and safety.''
   In January 1988 the utility filed for protection under Chapter
11 of the federal bankruptcy code _ a move that allowed the company
to continue operating while it reorganized.
   Shannon seized on that development to make the case that the NRC
should consider financing as a safety concern right along with such
other issues as evacuation planning. Shannon's case was rejected by
the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, by an NRC appeals board and,
on Thursday, by the commission itself.
   ``There is absolutely no question that we will appeal this,''
said Massachusetts Assistant Attorney General Stephen Jonas.
   Completed in mid-1986 for $4.6 billion, the Seabrook plant has
continued to run up costs from interest payments on borrowed
construction money and from operating expenses. The total price tag
to date is $6.2 billion and rising at the rate of $100 million
every two months.
   Seabrook already has a license to conduct low-power testing and
went through a battery of tests last spring. The NRC, citing
various problems with the plant operation, ordered Seabrook to
cease testing. But, according to plant spokesman Ron Sher, the
low-power testing had already been completed.

<HEAD>Bush Calls Natural Gas `Vital Part' of Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday called natural gas
a ``vital part'' of America's energy future and said he is
``absolutely determined'' to reduce dependence on foreign sources
of energy.
   Bush, addessing nearly 200 natural gas suppliers, also appealed
for support for his clean air bill, which he said had emerged
``relatively intact'' from a House Energy subcommittee last week.
   The president, noting he once ``had a tiny interest in gas
wells'' during his years as a Texas oilman, said he remains worried
about growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, despite brighter
prospects for world peace.
   ``I don't like the ever increasing dependency on foreign sources
of energy,'' he said.
   He said Energy Secretary James Watkins is preparing a national
energy strategy that will point the way toward bolstering U.S.
production.
   ``That means not only more hydrocarbons, but it also means a
safe, sound use of other energy sources,'' sad Bush.
   Bush recently signed the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, a
long sought industry goal. Lifting the last government controls on
prices will both spur production and help consumers over the long
run, said the president.
   ``Natural gas is going to be ... vital to our domestic energy
security,'' said Bush. ``With growing difficulties in oil and gas
leasing, and difficulties in siting nuclear plants, we're going to
depend more than ever ... on balanced energy sources.''
   With both Watkins and Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator William Reilly beside him, Bush said his clean air
bill is ``good news for clean burning fuels'' such as natural gas.
   There is ``no question your industry is going to be in the
forefront, a vital part of this picture,'' said Bush.
   The United States imported nearly 50 percent of its oil this
past summer, the highest level since the late 1970s. One of the
main concerns is that most of the increase is coming from Middle
Eastern countries, where political unrest could play havoc with the
flow of oil.
   Bush addressed the gas suppliers at a briefing in the Old
Executive Office Building.

<HEAD>Boy Charged in Accidental Death of Sister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old boy has been charged with
manslaughter in the accidental shooting death of his 7-year-old
sister, who was shot while he was playing with a sawed-off shotgun
at home.
   Prosecutors said they determined that Marvin Williams was
grossly negligent in deliberately aiming the weapon at the girl
with his finger on the trigger. The gun went off and Calandra
Graham was shot in the face.
   The shooting in which the boy was charged Wednesday occurred on
Sept. 13, before the Oct. 1 effective date of a new state law that
penalizes adults who leave weapons left where they can be easily
obtained by children.
   The two children were alone at home at the time of the shooting,
and the boy told investigators conflicting stories of what
happened, said state attorney's spokesman Randy Means.
   Investigators later determined Marvin took the gun from an
unlocked cabinet in his 18-year-old brother's bedroom and played
with it for a few minutes before returning to his brother's bedroom
to put it away.
   There he saw his sister. Means said the boy pointed the gun at
the girl and told her ``something to the effect of: `Don't worry.
It's not dangerous.''' The gun then went off.
   Prosecutors believe the shooting was an accident, but Means said
the boy's conduct was so careless that it rises to the level of
culpable negligence, the standard used to prove manslaughter.
   Marvin's mother, Mattie Williams, said when told of the charge:
``I don't understand it. But we will deal with it.''
   Means said prosecutors had not decided whether to charge
Marvin's brother, Efrem Bolden, with illegal possession of the
short-barreled shotgun, an outlawed weapon.
   In a similar case in Orlando in June, a 10-year-old was shot and
killed by a 13-year-old, who was not charged. The 13-year-old was
not paying attention to where he was aiming the gun when it went
off, prosecutors said.
   That was among a series of similar cases last summer around the
state in which children playing with guns accidentally shot other
children, injuring or killing them, and led to the new law that
took effect Oct. 1 aimed at keeping loaded guns out of the hands of
children.
   Since that law took effect, Tallahassee police have filed one
charge against a man whose 8-year-old granddaughter shot herself in
the thumb with a pistol taken from an unlocked box. And a
prosecutor in Palatka has said he would go to a grand jury with a
case in which a 12-year-old was killed by a 9-year-old playmate
showing off a rifle.

   California experts were teaching
Pennsylvania engineers how to make bridges earthquake-resistant
when reports of the killer San Francisco Bay area quake flashed
across the nation.
   Lindsay R. Jones, team leader and vice president of Dynamic
Isolation Systems, wasn't surprised at the news, but was concerned
about the safety of his family in Lafayette, six miles east of
Berkeley, where his office is.
   ``We don't consider this a big quake _ a 6.9 on the Richter
scale,'' he said at a Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
office where he had been discussing earthquake technology. ``The
next one could be the big one _ an 8.0 on the scale _ that would be
10 times as destructive as yesterday's quake.''
   Nonetheless, Jones couldn't make contact with his wife until a
day after the Tuesday earthquake that shook Northern California.
She was unhurt.
   Jones also learned Wednesday that a bridge on which DIS
installed special shock-absorbing equipment withstood the quake.
The Sierra Point Bridge on Route 101 is just north of San
Francisco, two miles south of Candlestick Park.
   ``One of our employees drove over the Sierra Point bridge
(Tuesday) night and it performed well. This is very significant
because the freeway bridge was retrofitted three years ago and it
proves that our technology works,'' he said.
   The bridge had been retrofitted with seismic isolation bearings
designed, cube-shaped devices made largely of layers of rubber with
a solid lead core. In bridges, the 3-foot-square isolators are
installed between the piers and the bridge deck to absorb
vibrations caused by an earthquake.

<HEAD>Thatcher Blasts Sanctions Against South Africa, Australia Defends
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain on Thursday accused its
former colonies in the Commonwealth of promoting poverty through
embargoes against South Africa, but Australia proposed a plan of
tougher financial sanctions.
   ``Our course is constructive. We want to help the people of
South Africa,'' British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said while
under attack from fellow Commonwealth leaders, her officials
reported.
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, expressing disappointment
at a new agreement by international banks to reschedule South
African debt, proposed the Commonwealth press foreign banks to
squeeze the white-run government's trade financing.
   Hawke, acknowledging reforms by South Africa's President F.W. de
Klerk, stopped short of seeking a wider boycott of South African
exports under his plan that would take effect after six months.
   ``It would be churlish not to acknowledge there have been some
recent changes,'' Hawke said. But he added the ``fundamentals of
apartheid'' remained.
   The leaders of the Commonwealth, the 49-nation association of
Britain and its former colonies, will consider the Australian plan
this weekend. South Africa quit the organization in 1961.
   The debt rescheduling, announced Wednesday, of $8 billion of
South Africa's $20 billion debt by foreign banks enraged some
African leaders. Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda denounced the banks,
mostly American and European, as ``bloodsuckers.''
   In Zambia, the guerrilla-backed African National Congress, the
main organization fighting the South African government, on
Thursday condemned international banks for the rescheduling,
calling it ``an act of inhumanity and as a means of helping to
perpetuate the evil system of apartheid.''
   Hawke said his proposal, jointly sponsored by Canada, was
supported by most of the other heads of government in the largely
Third World organization.
   Britain, the largest foreign investor in South Africa, agreed to
join a 10-nation committee of foreign ministers charged with
drawing up the summit's final declaration on South Africa.
   But Mrs. Thatcher, the sole opponent of sanctions, rejected any
tougher measures or giving South Africa a deadline to end
apartheid, the system which disenfranchises the black majority.
   ``No one in this room would take instructions or accept
ultimata,'' a British official quoted her as telling the summit
during the closed debate on South Africa.
   ``She said she found it strange to be a member of a conference
which spent its time trying to increase poverty. In so far as
sanctions work, they increase poverty,'' added the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On the debt rescheduling, she commented that banks ``have a duty
to their shareholders'' to recover debts.
   Without rescheduling, South Africa may have defaulted or
suspended repayments.
   Hawke said the terms of debt rescheduling agreement were harsh,
noting that South Africa must repay $1.5 billion by the end of
1993. Anti-apartheid campaigners said South Africa had a better
deal than severely indebted Mexico.
   Under the Australian plan, the Commonwealth would call on
international banks to restrict South African trade credits to a
maximum of 90 days and to make it harder for South Africa to get
credit or insurance.
   The proposal also endorses an African-supported blueprint for
change stipulating negotiations with the African National Congress.
Mrs. Thatcher objects to that, too.
   Hawke proposed the Commonwealth investigate International
Monetary Fund help of ``post-apartheid South Africa.''
   He said a Commonwealth committee will meet again in April and
review developments in South Africa, including whether de Klerk
lifted the state of emergency, stopped hanging people for
politically inspired crimes, shown willingness to abolish basic
apartheid laws and freed black leader Nelson Mandela.
   Hawke said the summit did not, however, set out specific
conditions that South Africa must fulfill by then.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said it is
``irrelevant'' what is decided by such a conference, some of whose
member countries ``have never seen an election in their whole
history, many of whom don't have independent judiciaries, many of
whom have state-controlled presses.''
   The Commonwealth in 1986 adopted 11 non-binding sanctions,
including bans on air links, new investment, and imports of
agricultural products, iron, steel, coal and uranium. Britain
strongly resisted the idea of a list but eventually applied a
handful of measures.
   Countries neighboring South Africa, including Commonwealth
members Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana, support sanctions by other
countries but refuse to impose them because South Africa is their
leading trade partner.
   The Commonwealth countries that impose sanctions tend to be ones
that never have had extensive contact with South Africa, such as
Canada, Nigeria and Caribbean and Asian nations.

   The homes of two prominent
leftists were bombed early Thursday, continuing violence that both
the military and leftists say is intended to frustrate a fledgling
peace process.
   Two sleeping bodyguards were slightly wounded when a bomb
exploded at the home of Ruben Zamora, a leader of the Democratic
Convergence, a leftist coalition.
   Earlier, three grenades exploded on the roof and outside the
front door of the house next door, where Aronette Diaz, vice
president of the Nationalist Democratic Union, lives with her two
sons.
   Mrs. Diaz, who is the widow of Ruben Zamora's brother, Mario,
blamed the army for the attacks.
   The armed forces press comittee, COPREFA, condemned the assaults.
   ``This kind of action serves only to escalate the violence
generated by those who do not want to live in peace,'' said an army
communique.
   Zamora, his wife and their five children were shaken up but
uninjured by the blast. The explosion destroyed the roof over the
front rooms of the house in the southern part of the city, as well
as doors, ceilings and walls in four rooms. Two cars parked in a
carport in front of the house were demolished.
   Damage to the front rooms of Mrs. Diaz's home also was extensive.
   Zamora said the attack on the homes ``is intended to impede a
political solution to the war.'' He did not accuse anyone.
   ``This is the work of people in the army who don't want dialogue
and negotiation,'' said Mrs. Diaz. ``They want to start another
spiral of violence like in 1980, wheh insurgents waging the war
against a succession of U.S.-backed governments.
   Representatives of the government and leftist rebels on
Wednesday ended three days of peace talks in Costa Rica. They
produced no substantive advances toward a cease-fire in their
10-year-old war and managed only to agree to meet again.
   But both the guerrillas' Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, known as FMLN, and the rightist government of President
Alfredo Cristiani said the groundwork was laid for greater progress
in a meeting scheduled Nov. 20 and Nov. 21 in Venezuela.
   The government has proposed an immediate cease-fire, while the
rebels first want a series of economic, political and social
reforms along with guarantees they will be able to participate in
national affairs as a legal political party.
   A major obstacle has been differences on what constitutes a
cease-fire and on how to establish one.

   The commander of the U.S. and allied forces in
Europe, Gen. John Galvin, said Thursday that budget pressures force
the nation's military chiefs to haggle over Pentagon spending in
discussions that resemble Aztec ``bloodletting ceremonies.''
   Galvin, who is the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and the
commander-in-chief of the U.S. European Command, spoke of the
internal negotiations that go on among the nation's highest
military leaders as they grapple with budget cuts.
   For the past five years, the Pentagon has had to deal with
declining funds.
   The four-star general was asked at a meeting with reporters to
address the issue that dwindling budget resources means the
Pentagon ``can't have everything'' it wants and may be forced to
cut entire weapons systems.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, currently embroiled in budget
discussions with Capitol Hill lawmakers over the Pentagon's $295
billion budget, has attempted to cut programs such as the V-22
Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the F-14D jet fighter, but has met
stiff opposition.
   Galvin said it is clear, that given budget pressures, the
nation's military will be pared down.
   ``Everybody is looking at this ...it's a big thing for us. We
face an austere future,'' Galvin said. ``At the same time ... we
are responsible for deterrence and defense, and so how are we going
to do this? How are we going to draw up these priority lists?''
   The four-star general said he is taking part in Pentagon
sessions over the next two days where ``a lot of that is being
discussed.''
   ``Those are kind of bloodletting ceremonies, like the Aztecs. We
get up on top of the pyramid and try to work it out,'' Galvin said.
   Told that such ceremonies included trying to ``pull the other
guy's heart out,'' Galvin, with a smile, shot back, ``That's what
I'm talking about. This is hard work, and hard negotiating among
service chiefs.''
   The general, who elicited a hearty round of laughter from the
reporters with his remarks, hastily added that such negotiations
are ``really done in a good spirit.''
   The general said he did not want to give the impression that the
military chiefs are ``only looking out as far as the end of my
nose,'' and ``don't care what is happening the day after tomorrow.''
   He said that in order to respond to the changes that are
sweeping the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, as well as the
ongoing arms control negotiations, the U.S. military chiefs are
``doing a lot of thinking'' and are trying ``to draw closer and
closer together on ... If you can't have it all, what do you give
up?''
   Galvin said that such infighting among the service chiefs
``always goes on, but as you get into more austerity, it gets
worse.''

<HEAD>Ivory Ban to Cover Stockpiled Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A worldwide ban on trade in ivory
was formally extended Thursday to cover hundreds of tons of
supplies already stockpiled, despite arguments that the move will
increase smuggling.
   Environmentalists welcomed the decision by the 103-nation
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which on
Tuesday agreed to a ban on ivory trading to protect the dwindling
African elephant population.
   The convention's secretariat proposed that the sale of existing
stockpiles be exempt, but delegates Thursday rejected this and
endorsed by consensus a decision to apply it to all ivory.
   Spokesman Jean-Patrick Le Duc said the secretariat made the
proposal because of fears smugglers will move in to meet demand if
the sale of legally acquired stocks is outlawed. That view was
echoed by Hong Kong, which is believed to hold the majority of
stockpiled ivory.
   ``If existing stocks were allowed to be traded under close
monitoring, it would not enhance poaching. A ban might pose more
difficulties,'' a Hong Kong representative on the British
delegation said on condition of anonymity.
   He said the ban would have a ``drastic impact'' on the 3,000
people in Hong Kong who carve and work ivory, many of whom are
elderly craftsmen.
   Hong Kong, a British colony, has no separate voting rights and
officials said Britain abstained in the committee vote out of
respect for Hong Kong.
   On Tuesday, the conference approved by consensus a formal ban on
ivory trade with a provision that countries that prove sound
wildlife management can apply for a resumption of limited trade.
   This amounts to at least a two-year moratorium because any
exemptions are not likely to be considered before the next
conference in 1991.
   Welcoming the decision to include stockpiles in the ban,
environmentalist Tom Milliken said continued trade in stockpiles
``would have unleashed a nightmare for enforcement (of the ban).''
   Steve Cobb of the Ivory Trade Review Group agreed. ``There is
far less sympathy for the owners of stockpiles, the majority of
which are of illegal origin, than for the African nations affected
by the ban which manage their herds well,'' he said.
   The conference, which ends Friday, was attended by about 400
government delegates and 400 observers from numerous environmental
groups.
   While considering about 300 endangered animals and plants,
delegates focused on the African elephant, whose numbers are
estimated to have been cut in half to 600,000 in the past decade.

   The Senate on Thursday defeated a proposed
constitutional amendment to ban burning and desecration of the
American flag, dealing a sharp rebuff to President Bush on an issue
he had put in the spotlight.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said as the
Senate defeated the amendment, ``We do not serve our national
tradition by forcing Americans to make a false and unnecessary
choice between the flag and the Constitution.''
   However, Republican leader Bob Dole said, ``I think the flag
should be flown at half-staff after this vote.''
   The White House said Bush was ``disappointed'' at the Senate's
action.
   The proposal won a slight majority, 51-48, but that was 15 votes
short of the two-thirds of senators present and voting that was
needed for approval.
   Democrats led the opposition, but the vote was hardly along
strict party lines. Thirty-three Republicans and 18 Democrats voted
for the measure, while 11 Republicans and 37 Democrats opposed it.
   Congress gave final passage last week to a bill to ban flag
burning by simple statute.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said after Thursday's vote
that Bush continued to believe that a constitutional amendment
offered ``the only ... real protection for the flag'' and that the
law, which he will allow to take effect without his signature,
``would not survive constitutional scrutiny.''
   He had called for the constitutional amendment in June after the
Supreme Court threw out the conviction of Texas flag burner Gregory
Lee Johnson on grounds that a Texas flag-burning law violated his
constitutional right of freedom of speech.
   Arguing broke out between the parties even after the vote as
Democrats charged that Bush and GOP National Chairman Lee Atwater
had pushed the amendment to put pressure on them. ``He has used his
high office for a low purpose,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said of Bush.
   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., noted that 18 Democrats had
supported the measure. ``I do not think this is a partisan matter
that is being engineered for crass political purposes.''
   The argument that the issue could be a potent election weapon
against senators who opposed the amendment appeared to lose steam
this week.
   Mitchell told reporters Thursday morning before the vote that
the outcome, by then sure, was due to the ``sound judgment of the
American people.'' Other lawmakers said most Americans apparently
are not overly interested in the proposed amendment.
   The measure would have authorized state and federal governments
to ban burning and desecration of the flag. Critics said the danger
to the flag was not as great as to the Bill of Rights.
   ``For 200 years, they have protected the liberties of Americans
through economic turmoil, civil war, political strife, social
upheaval and international tension,'' Mitchell said.
   ``Despite the worst that fate has hurled at us, we have never
found it necessary to abandon the fundamental principles on which
our government was founded and by which our liberties are
secured,'' he added.
   ``We face no sudden or controllable burst of flag destruction.
We face no massive alienation by our people from the symbols and
traditions of our nation. Yet we are being asked to believe that
the flag which neither Hitler nor Stalin could defeat is now
threatened by a single misguided person who most Americans never
heard of and don't care about,'' Mitchell said.
   In a final appeal on behalf of the measure, Senate Minority
Leader Dole, R-Kan., took the Senate floor to invoke the history of
the flag from Iwo Jima to the moon landing.
   ``To say that the act of flag burning is somehow deeply
enshrined in the First Amendment is preposterous,'' Dole said. He
said it was wrong in view of laws that ``make it illegal to rip the
warning label off your own mattress in some states.''
   ``The purpose, the need, for this amendment will not be found in
a textbook or in a treatise on constitutional law,'' Dole said.
``No, it will be found in the emotions of the heart, emotions
deeply rooted in the real life experiences of millions of Americans
and emotions that are crying out today to give the flag real and
lasting protection.''
   The vote came as no surprise to Republicans. Two GOP
co-sponsors, Sens. John C. Danforth of Missouri and Warren Rudman
of New Hampshire, dropped their support Tuesday and joined the
ranks of the critics.

   Angry words flew between the White House and
San Francisco's city hall Thursday as the Bush administration came
under attack for the second time in a month for steering clear of
the Democratic mayor of a city devastated by a natural disaster.
   ``A publicity stunt,'' was how Mayor Art Agnos characterized
Vice President Dan Quayle's tour of the earthquake-stricken San
Francisco Bay area.
   ``We regret very much that the mayor of San Francisco has
decided not to cooperate with us in this matter in making sure that
there is adequate federal support for the disaster,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater retorted.
   The spat between Quayle and Agnos was reminiscent of the
controversy surrounding President Bush's visit to South Carolina
after Hurricane Hugo.
   The president bypassed Charleston despite an invitation from
Democratic Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. Instead, Bush toured suburban
Summerville, a community about 20 miles inland which was not as
hard-hit as the city.
   ``Airplane rides and helicopter rides are nice, but everything
is on the ground,'' Riley said. ``The buildings are on the ground,
the people are on the ground, the stress is on the ground and we
need a president who is on the ground.''
   Bush flew to South Carolina eight days after Hugo devastated the
Charleston area, with his administration under fire from officials
including Riley and Democratic Sen. Ernest F. Hollings who said the
federal government was bungling relief efforts.
   Riley was left at the airport as Bush took his whirlwind tour.
Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell, who was Bush's Southern campaign
chairman in the last election, and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
accompanied the president.
   Asked by reporters at the time why he was left behind, Riley
replied: ``I wasn't invited.'' In an interview Thursday. Riley said
he shook hands with Bush at the airport, but ``I didn't really have
a chance to discuss anything with him. I just had a chance to tell
him the people of Charleston were really hurting.''
   The Quayle-Agnos flap erupted as Bush was preparing to fly to
California on Friday to view earthquake damage.
   When Fitzwater was asked if the president would meet with Agnos,
the spokesman at first replied:
   ``The president will meet with mayors and local officials from
the local area, absolutely.''
   ``What about that mayor?'' pressed reporters.
   ``Everyone will be invited, absolutely,'' Fitzwater said.
   A short time later, the White House announced that the mayors of
San Francisco, Oakland and Alameda would accompany the president on
his tour of the area.
   The White House insisted that Quayle's decision to pass up a
visit with Agnos was not politically motivated.
   Agnos said he was ``ticked off'' by Quayle's decision not to see
him separately.
   Quayle and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner visited the
Bay area on Wednesday, met with dozens of local and state officials
and paved the way for Bush's visit.
   Agnos complained that Quayle ``flies around in a helicopter,
makes a bunch of television spots. ... I understand he was in the
Marina (district), and in the shelters and then left.''
   ``If he did so without visiting the mayor, I have real questions
about what he was doing here. It may have been just a publicity
stunt.''
   Quayle, in turn, called Agnos' charge ``a political shot'' and
said: ``We invited all the mayors to come and sit down with us.''
   Interviewed on ``CBS This Morning,'' Quayle said: ``I would hope
the mayor would resist any kind of political rhetoric at this time
and concentrate'' on helping victims.
   Fitzwater said Agnos was invited to two separate meetings that
Quayle and Skinner held with local officials.
   ``We offered to send a helicopter to pick him up wherever he was
and deliver him to the meetings and he declined that,'' Fitzwater
said.
   He also said chief of staff John Sununu repeatedly tried to
contact Agnos by phone ``and he has declined to talk to us.''

<HEAD>Sources: Americans Witness Libyan Arms Delivery to Somalia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya has secretly escalated its weapons
supplies to Somalia to replace dwindling U.S. aid, but the recent
arrival of arms and Libyan officers to the port of Mogadishu was
witnessed by the American ambassador, sources said Thursday.
   The Somali government, headed by President Siad Barre, has
become increasinly desperate to obtain military hardware in the
face of growing challenges from rebels in various parts of the
country.
   U.S. military aid to Somalia has been shrinking for several
years as a protest against the government's human rights abuses,
but there are still some U.S. military personnel advising the
Somali military.
   The United States is currently seeking to renegotiate the
agreement for use of the Red Sea port of Berbera by U.S. Navy
vessels. The U.S. facility is used mostly by sailors on shore leave
from duty in the Indian Ocean.
   A report commissioned by the State Department last summer
concluded that the Somali army murdered at least 5,000 civilians
over an 11-month period.
   Barre, who has also been shunned by the Soviet Union and
potential allies in the Moslem world, turned to Libya's leader
Moammar Gadhafi last year but information disseminated by Somali
opposition groups about the Libyan deliveries has been hard to
verify.
   ``Libya is increasing its assistance to the Somali government.
To our knowledge, this includes military hardware, but no troops or
military advisers,'' said a recent State Department statement.
   But other sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
Libyan ship which docked in Mogadishu recently discharged 18 Libyan
officers, including 6 pilots. The ship also carried 10 tanks and 10
long-range Soviet-made cannons, they said.
   The ship's docking was witnessed by Barre himself, as well as by
U.S. ambassador Frank Crigler, said the sources.
   A State Department official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed that a Libyan ship had docked in Mogadishu but
declined to discuss other details.
   He said the Libyan aid was ``not massive,'' and included rifles
and ammunition. ``But the fact that it's Libyan is disconcerting,''
he added.
   Dissident Somali groups say Libya has also supplied the Barre
government with chemical weapons, especially mustard gas, but
sources in the intelligence community say there are conflicting
views about the veracity of the reports.
   Gadhafi reportedly plans a visit to Somalia on Oct. 21.
   Somalia, which shifted its alliance from the Soviet Union to the
West in 1977, has also been buying arms on the open market although
it is experiencing a cash problem because of a heavy foreign debt.
   Congress earlier this year turned down an administration request
to approve $21 million for Somalia to pay its arrears to the
International Monetary Fund so it can become eligible for
additional loans. The administration decided not to press the
request, saying it could not make a convincing case in light of
recent events in Somalia.

<HEAD>Former Captain Of Exxon Valdez Claims Immunity In Alaska Oil Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former tanker captain whose ship
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil wants a federal
court to block his prosecution, arguing that his prompt reporting
of the spill grants him immunity.
   In a motion filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Fairbanks,
former Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood's attorneys argue that
a 1976 clean water law precludes criminal prosecution over the
nation's biggest oil spill.
   Hazelwood has filed a similar motion in state Superior Court,
claiming Alaska law also grants immunity from prosecution to people
who promptly report spills they cause.
   The state has filed three felony charges and three misdemeanors
against Hazelwood. They accuse him of criminal mischief, operating
a ship while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent
discharge of oil.
   Defense attorney Dick Madson said state officials are prohibited
by federal law from using Hazelwood's statements to the Coast Guard
in any criminal proceedings.
   Soon after the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef on March
24, Hazelwood called the Coast Guard by radio to report the
situation.
   Within a week, the state filed the misdemeanor charges, and
later added the felony criminal mischief counts. Hazelwood was
fired by Exxon.
   The charges have been consolidated for a single trial, but the
case has been postponed repeatedly. A hearing on motions is
scheduled Friday. A hearing a week from Friday will determine where
his trial is to be held.
   There was no indication when the federal courts might consider
the matter.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament passed a bill Thursday
allowing opposition parties to compete in national elections, and
it also dealt the ruling Socialist Party a setback by banning
politics from the workplace.
   The legislators, who have amended the constitution to reflect
democratic ideals, rejected an alternative motion by the Socialist
Party to restrict political activities to shop and factory floors.
   Such politicization of the workplace has been a key weapon of
communist indoctrination and is sharply opposed by opposition
groups.
   The Socialist Party, formed Oct. 7 to replace the communist
party that had ruled Hungary since 1948, has vowed commitment to
democracy, but many of its leaders were ranking members of the old
party.
   Last week, it overwhelmingly approved a motion calling for the
right to continue to organize at the workplace.
   Constitutional amendments formally ending one-party rule and
giving political parties the right ``to be freely established and
... (to) freely function'' were approved Wednesday. The law passed
Thursday formally outlines the rights of parties wishing to field
candidates in next year's elections, due by June.
   They will be the first freely contested elections here since
1947.
   The bill also places limits on the contributions parties may
receive, and it draws the line between funds and property the
ruling party legally acquired and other assets owned by the state
but controlled by the party.
   The assets, valued at nearly $200 million, have been a
contentious issue between the party and the opposition, which
claims much party wealth was seized illegally.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said Hungary has taken ``yet another historic and courageous step
toward democracy.
   ``The constitution institutionalizes many of the laws and
practices implemented in recent months to reform Hungary from a
state controlled by the communist party to one of democratic
pluralism,'' she said.
   A proposed law regulating next year's election envisions a
modified system of proportional representation designed to give all
parties contesting the elections a chance to win mandates.
   Interior minister Istvan Horvath, who presented the bill, said
it was evidence of the transition to democracy. ``The franchise ...
is a basic political right of the citizens,'' he said.
   He pledged that the state-owned media will carry each party's
manifesto and campaign summary without biased comment.
   Parliament also approved establishment Thursday of a
Constitutional Court, which will have the power to dismiss laws
contrary to the constitution.
   Its 15 members will not be permitted to belong to any party or
to have recently held any government post.
   The constitutional amendments passed Wednesday established the
office of president of the republic, who will replace the 21-man
collective presidency. Still to be decided is when and how the
president will be elected.
   A presidential election is tentatively scheduled Nov. 26. Some
opposition groups want the president to be chosen later, fearing
the ruling party will have too strong of an advantage if elections
are held next month. The issue is expected to be discussed this
week.

   First lady Barbara Bush read to Big Bird and his
friends Thursday during a taping of ``Sesame Street.''
   ``Hi _ this is my friend, Mrs. Bush,'' the feathered star told
his television audience.
   ``It's nice to see you again, Big Bird,'' replied the first
lady, who had appeared onstage with Big Bird, his fellow Sesame
Street character Maria, and Marilyn Quayle, the vice president's
wife, during a children's party that was part of the inaugural
festivities.
   This time, Mrs. Bush's co-stars included Count von Count and
five preschoolers from day care centers near the Children's
Television Workshop studio in Manhattan.
   The first lady, who frequently makes public appearances to
promote literacy, read ``Peter's Chair,'' by Ezra Jack Keats, to
Big Bird and the children while the Count counted the pages. Big
Bird explained that he had borrowed the book from the Sesame Street
library.
   ``That's 15 wonderful storybook pages!'' the Count proclaimed.
   During the taping, 6-year-old Bonnie Weiss proudly placed her
foot on the first lady's lap to show off her painted sneakers.
   Afterward, four more children arrived for a later taping. Mrs.
Bush invited all nine to pose with her for a picture.
   No airing date has been chosen for the segment, said Elizabeth
Martin, a spokeswoman for Children's Television Workshop. The
award-winning Public Broadcasting Service show's 21st season begins
Nov. 13.

<HEAD>$1.3 Million Lotto Ticket Found in Cookie Jar Days Before Expiration
Date</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newton Hazell found the sweetest treat of all at
the bottom of his cookie jar _ a long-forgotten lottery ticket
worth $1.3 million that would have become worthless just four days
later.
   ``Isn't that something? This was down to the nitty gritty.
Another week and I would have lost it,'' the Metuchen, N.J.,
correction officer said Thursday.
   Hazell, 58, bought the New York Lotto ticket for the Oct. 22,
1988, drawing at a delicatessen on Staten Island, selecting the
same numbers he picks every week _ 7, 9, 13, 21, 34 and 43. He
dumped the ticket into his cookie jar at home and never checked to
see if he won.
   ``I just stuck it in and forgot all about it,'' said Hazell, who
works at the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility on Staten Island.
   Last week, Hazell was back in the deli when he noticed a sign
encouraging Lotto players to check their tickets because a $1.3
million prize was still unclaimed. A newspaper story pinned next to
the sign showed the missing ticket contained his numbers. That's
when Hazell began to search.
   ``I looked everywhere, because I saw my numbers. I went through
dressers, drawers, under the mattress. I went through a bag where I
throw all my losing tickets,'' he said.
   Then, Hazel said he got a feeling about the cookie jar and went
to check it out: ``There it was, all by itself.''
   Winners have one year to produce their tickets. Hazell showed up
Wednesday, with just 96 hours to spare.
   State lottery spokesman Bill Knowlton said it was the longest
anybody had ever waited to claim a prize. Two other people also
picked winning numbers in the same drawing and both had already
claimed their shares of a $4 million jackpot, he said.
   Hazell, whose winning numbers combined his birthday,
anniversary, daughter's age and license plate number, said the
windfall won't have any immediate effect on his lifestyle.
   ``I'm not going to retire. I'm a young 58, going on 25,'' he
said. ``I'm going to stay very active.''
   ``It's like a dream. It's wonderful. All of a sudden, I don't
know if I'm a celebrity or not.''

<HEAD>Peace Efforts Stalled by Israeli-US Dispute</HEAD>

Shamir letter to Baker. Pickup 9th pvs, `The latest...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A public argument on Middle East policy between
Israel and the United States has stalled peace efforts at least
until Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir visits Washington next month,
officials said Thursday.
   Shamir declared Tuesday the two allies were ``entering a period
of tension'' and Israel ``will not be pushed or pressured.''
   The next day, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
described his comments as ``unhelpful.''
   Frank G. Wisner, U.S. ambassador to Egypt, said Thursday the
United States and Egypt feel ``creative diplomacy'' can renew
progress toward peace in the region.
   ``No doors have been closed; no last words have been spoken,''
Wisner said in Cairo after spending more than three hours at the
Foreign Ministry. He delivered a message from Secretary of State
James A. Baker III to Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the Egyptian foreign
minister.
   Abdel-Meguid would not say what the message contained. He later
told a meeting of the U.S.-Egyptian chamber of commerce that Egypt
wants the American role in Middle East politics to continue.
   Until the remarks Tuesday to members of his right-wing Likud
bloc, Shamir had avoided confrontations with U.S. leaders despite
his disagreement with the dialogue Washington began in December
with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Yossi Ahimeir, director of Shamir's office, said the prime
minister spoke out because of what he considered growing attempts
by the Bush administration to get Israel into negotiations with the
PLO. Israel defines the PLO as a terrorist group and refuses to
deal with it.
   ``What he meant was that there is liable to be a period of
differences, but he is doing everything to prevent it,'' Ahimeir
said in an interview Thursday.
   On Thursday, Israel radio revealed another apparent effort to
diffuse tensions. The radio said Shamir wrote Baker praising his
efforts to advance peace in the Middle East but emphasizing
Israel's opposition to talks with the PLO.
   Shamir aides could not be reached for comment on the letter.
   The latest U.S. efforts, led by Baker, are aimed at starting
Israeli-Palestinian talks about Israel's plan for residents of the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to elect delegates for
negotiations with the Israelis.
   Israel's Cabinet leadership rejected Baker's suggestions two
weeks ago, claiming they opened the door to indirect PLO
involvement, but Baker pursued the matter in private conversations
with Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   Ahimeir indicated Shamir felt the United States had betrayed the
essence of the Israeli plan, which excludes the PLO.
   ``We are sorry that only five months have passed'' since Shamir
introduced the peace plan ``and everyone has already lost patience
and is running to the PLO with open arms,'' he said.
   ``There are now changes in the American position and they want
to add things. We will not accept anything where the bottom line
will be to sit down with the PLO.''
   News reports in Israel said Shamir called President Bush on
Tuesday, after making his comments, to take issue with the latest
U.S. peace moves.
   Ahimeir confirmed the 10-minute conversation occurred, but would
not give detais. He said only that the tone was ``friendly'' and
Shamir expressed his views.
   The daily Haaretz, quoting a senior Bush administration official
it did not name, said the president told Shamir he was
``disappointed'' by the remarks.
   Two senior Israeli officials said privately the result of the
conversation was a decision to put a temporary hold on American
peace efforts until Shamir's trip to Washington in mid-November. A
statement from Shamir's office Thursday said he and Bush decided to
discuss peace issues further at that time.
   Israeli newspapers criticized the prime minister's comments.
Even the conservative Maariv published an editorial Thursday called
``Shamir is Looking for Confrontation.''
   It said the Americans might respond by turning to pressing
domestic matters and putting the Middle East on the back burner
because, ``after all, advancing toward peace in the region is more
important for Israel than for them.''

<HEAD>Sparse Food Supply Forces Black Bears Into Cities, Campgrounds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDY SHORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black bear sightings in Colorado and New Mexico
cities and campgrounds have doubled this year because dry weather
has cut into the animals' normal food supply, forcing them to risk
confrontations with humans.
   Scavenging bears have pawed through campsites, trash cans and
dumps, showed up on golf courses, and even entered one home to
empty a refrigerator of groceries and wine.
   ``They are capable of eating so many different things,'' said
Todd Malmsbury, Colorado Department of Wildlife public information
officer. ``They'll be happy to go up to a picnic table and eat your
breakfast for you.''
   Colorado's spring and summer were drier than normal, which
damaged the berry and acorn crops as well as foliage that bears
feed on, officials said.
   The plight of the hungry bears has become more evident as the
animals prepare to hibernate in early November.
   If female bears hibernate without an adequate fat reserve, they
can lose their cubs; other bears without enough fat can die. But
biologists won't know what kind of effect the food shortage will
have on the mortality rate until spring when a survey of cubs can
be made, said Bob Davies, a state wildlife biologist based in
Colorado Srings.
   Although the Colorado wildlife agency does not keep statewide
figures on bear sightings, Malmsbury said a good guess would be
they have at least doubled this year.
   ``We've had problems almost statewide. You tend to have more
problems where the people are,'' said Bob Davies, a state wildlife
biologist based in Colorado Springs.
   In Albuquerque, N.M., there have been 26 bear sightings since
August, said Mark Birkhauser, a conservation officer with the New
Mexico Department of Game and Fish. That compares with one or two
sightings in an average year.
   ``Statewide, we've been having trouble,'' Birkhauser said. ``The
extreme hotspots are Albuquerque, of course, because it's a big
metro area, and down near Capitan in the Capitan Mountains where
the bears are feeding on sheep.''
   In southeastern Colorado, which has the state's largest
concentration of black bears, wildlife officers have trapped and
relocated more than 60 bears, Malmsbury said. Fewer than 20 bears
are trapped and relocated in that area in an average year.
   Along the Front Range of the Rockies, which includes
metropolitan Denver, about 100 bears have been sighted this year,
he said. At least nine have been trapped and relocated, and 11 have
been killed either accidentally or because they were a danger to
humans.
   Neither Wyoming nor Montana has reported conflicts with black
bears and humans.
   The problems have been compounded by people who are careless
with trash or feed the animals directly, and other human activity,
said Malmsbury.
   ``Barbecue smells are extremely attractive to bears, and they
carry a long distance,'' Davies said. ``Bears have an acute sense
of smell and they follow their nose right to it.''
   One bear recently was killed after it broke into a home in the
mountain community of Evergreen, west of Denver, and ``ripped open
the refrigerator door, ate food and drank wine,'' Malmsbury said.
   In Colorado Springs, early morning golfers reached the fifth
hole and looked up to see a 5-year-old female bear in a tree,
Davies said. The animal was trapped and moved to a wilderness area.
   In July, state wildlife officers killed a bear that attacked a
woman at a campground in the foothills west of Denver. The bear
ripped open her tent, apparently to get at food she had inside,
officials said.
   Black bears usually grow to about 5 feet and weigh between 200
pounds and 300 pounds on the average. There are from 8,000 to
12,000 of them in Colorado, mostly in the southern region of the
state.
   ``The black bear, by nature, is not going to be an aggressive
animal normally,'' Malmsbury said. ``Some bears weigh over 400
pounds and are 6 feet tall. He can do pretty much whatever he wants
to.''

   Gen. Robert Herres, the first officer to serve
as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has asked to
retire next year, the Pentagon announced Thursday.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney accepted Herres' request ``with
regret,'' adding in a statement, ``I can hardly say `no' to a man
who has served his nation so capably for nearly 36 years.''
   The Air Force general has been serving as the deputy for the new
chairman of the joint chiefs, Gen. Colin Powell, who succeeded Adm.
William Crowe Jr. on Oct. 1.
   Herres was appointed to the newly-created position of vice
chairman in 1987 by President Reagan and was reappointed to the
post by Bush last May.
   Herres was widely reported to have been Crowe's choice for the
post of the president's chief military adviser.
   But President Bush, who had worked with Powell when he served as
the national security adviser to President Reagan, chose the Army
general instead.
   Two Navy admirals have been reported to be leading contenders
for the deputy post, including Adm. Powell Carter Jr., who is the
commander of the Atlantic Fleet, and Vice Adm. Jonathan Howe, who
served as Crowe's principal assistant.

   Among the casualties of the earthquake was
an anti-drug beachhead that the Guardian Angels had established on
a seedy block in the Tenderloin district.
   The six-story Camelot Hotel was condemned because of earthquake
damage and police evacuated residents early Thursday. The Angels, a
volunteer group known for its red berets and controversial
crime-fighting tactics, left shortly after Tuesday's quake.
   ``They're going to relocate us somewhere, I suppose,'' said
resident Austin J. Mahoney, 65, who leaned on a metal cane as he
looked up at the white stucco building, sandwiched between a
peep-show video parlor and a bar.
   ``I came out of prison and it was the only place I could get,''
said Mahoney, who moved in four years ago.
   The Angels made their headquarters on the third floor, where a
``Crackdown on Crack'' sign hung in a window. Neighbors said the
Angels used citizen's band radios and called the police when they
saw trouble.
   ``They helped clean out this block,'' Mahoney said. ``Crack was
sold on this block.''
   ``It was better that they were here than not,'' said another
resident, who identified himself only as Lionel. ``People did
(drugs) in their rooms, not in the hallways like it used to be.''
   The Angels, numbering about 10 residents and staff, left for an
unknown location after the earthquake, Camelot residents and
neighbors said.
   Lionel, 42, said the hotel, which charged between $250 and $350
a month, was in bad repair, but its closure leaves him nowhere to
live.
   A desk clerk awakened the 20 to 30 remaining residents about 4
a.m. Thursday, and told them the building had been condemned. A
large crack was visible on the hotel's top floor, and tenants said
the top two floors were uninhabitable.
   Like others displaced from rundown Tenderloin hotels, the
residents were taken by bus to emergency shelters at Moscone
Center, a half-mile away.
   ``I'm tired. I need a bath. This is rough, man,'' said Claude
Greenfield, whose hotel three blocks away was cleared of more than
100 residents Tuesday night. ``I need money. I need help.''

   A new plan to cut capital-gains taxes and
expand Individual Retirement Accounts was introduced Thursday with
the support of a majority of senators and the Bush administration.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., who, with Sen. Bill Roth, R-Del.,
wrote the bill, told reporters he expects it to become law this
year.
   A solid majority of the House already has voted for a
capital-gains tax cut _ as part of deficit-reduction legislation _
that carried the endorsement of President Bush. But that proposal
did not affect IRAs and the Senate version of the legislation does
not include the capital-gains provision.
   ``This plan provides opportunities and incentives for all
Americans,'' Roth said. ``It's good for both savers and investors.
And it's good for America.''
   Allowing one of the saving incentives without the other ``would
be like a henhouse without a rooster,'' Roth said. ``You may still
get the eggs but you're not going to keep the hens happy.''
   Packwood said he can count 55 to 58 votes for the measure. ``The
administration supports this bill, although it would support some
alternatives'' as well, he said.
   Negotiators from the House and Senate met for the first time to
try to write a compromise deficit-reduction bill, but as expected
got nowhere.
   The key gulf between the two chambers is over whether to remove
a capital gains tax cut and other provisions from the legislation,
and what would happen to them if they were removed.
   Those decisions ultimately will be made by House and Senate
leaders but negotiators met to state their positions.
   Senators insisted that the money-saving legislation be kept free
of controversial items, with Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., saying,
``We're not going to put them on this bill.''
   But Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., and other House members
expressed a reluctance to strip capital gains and other items from
the budget-cutting bill and assume ``everything else will fall into
place.''
   The Roth-Packwood bill would:
   _Exclude from taxation up to 35 percent of individual capital
gains, which are profits from the sale of stock and other
investments. The longer an asset were held, the less it would be
taxed. Five percent of the gain from the sale of assets owned more
than one year would be excluded; if the asset were held more than
seven years, 35 percent of the gain would be excluded.
   As an option, an investor could exclude from taxation any gain
caused solely by inflation.
   Present law fully taxes capital gains, just as it does wages and
salaries.
   _Cut the tax rate on corporate capital gains, now 34 percent, to
as low as 29 percent.
   _Permit individuals to set aside up to $2,000 a year in an IRA,
increasing to $3,000 a year after five years. There would be no tax
deduction on the contribution; instead, the contribution and
interest it earned could be withdrawn tax-free for retirement,
paying for a college education, medical expenses or buying a first
home.
   The plan would permit workers who in the past have made
tax-deductible contributions to an IRA to ``roll over'' those
accounts into one of the new types in order to become eligible for
tax-free withdrawals for education, medical expenses or homebuying.
   However, that rollover would require the worker to pay tax over
the following four years on the original tax-free contributions.
For example, a worker who contributed to an IRA in 1985 and 1986
could transfer that money into one of the new accounts in 1991 and
pay taxes on the transfer in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994.
   The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that
because of the rollover provision, the plan would raise federal
revenues by $1.3 billion over the next five years.
   Workers who are allowed under present law to make tax-deductible
IRA contributions would not lose that opportunity. This includes
any worker not covered by a company pension, any covered couple
with income under $50,000 and a covered single person with income
under $35,000.
   If the Roth-Packwood proposal is to become law, it would have to
be attached to some House-passed revenue bill. A prime candidate is
a debt-limit measure that must be passed this year to raise the
government's borrowing authority.
   The House-passed capital-gains amendment is part of a huge
deficit-reduction bill on which House and Senate negotiators began
working Thursday.

<HEAD>Specter Says He Will Vote to Acquit Hastings at Impeachment Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top Republican on the Senate panel that
heard evidence against federal Judge Alcee L. Hastings this summer
said Thursday that he will vote to acquit the Miami jurist of
impeachment charges.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said in a 76-page paper that after
weighing the evidence and considering an ``unblemished lifetime
record,'' he decided ``there is insufficient evidence to convict''
Hastings of plotting to obtain a bribe.
   The paper was circulated by Specter among his fellow lawmakers
as the Senate closed its doors to the public to deliberate in the
impeachment trial.
   The Senate on Wednesday heard closing arguments from Hastings
and his attorneys as well as House members who brought the 17
impeachment charges.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said that if
the lawmakers finished their closed-door deliberations on Thursday
they would vote on Friday on whether to remove Hastings from the
U.S. District Court bench.
   Hastings would immediately be removed and his $89,500 salary
would be stopped if he were convicted of any one of the 17
impeachement charges approved in August 1988 by the House.
   Hastings, the first black federal judge in Florida history, is
accused of conspiracy to obtain a $150,000 payoff, lying about it
to a jury that acquitted him of the charge in 1983 and improper
disclosure of information obtained through a court-authorized
wiretap.
   In his statement to the Senate on Wednesday, the affable,
53-year-old Hastings reaffirmed his denial that he took part in a
bribery conspiracy.
   Specter, vice chairman of a Senate panel that heard 18 days of
evidence this summer, noted that prosecutors at the 1983 trial told
jurors that Hastings was lying. ``Obviously the jury did not accept
those arguments.''
   He said the case that Hastings had improperly disclosed
information obtained from a wiretap ``was neither convincing nor
substantial.''
   Conviction would make Hastings the sixth official in history
removed by impeachment. The most recent was Judge Harry Claiborne
of Nevada in 1986 who fought in vain to remain on the bench while
serving a tax fraud sentence.
   District Judge Walter Nixon of Mississippi, convicted of lying
to a grand jury, is also fighting to remain on the federal bench.
   Hastings was accused of plotting with Washington attorney
William Borders in 1981 to obtain the payoff from two defendants in
his court. He had sentenced them to prison terms for their role in
a pension fraud scheme.
   An FBI undercover agent posing as one of the defendants
contacted Borders and offered him $150,000 in exchange for a
reduction of the sentences to probation. The attorney was arrested
Oct. 9, 1981, as he left a suburban Virginia motel with the agent
and a garment bag containing $125,000 in cash.
   Hastings, in Washington for a testimonial dinner in honor of
Borders that night, was told that the FBI wanted to contact him but
immediately returned to Miami by an indirect route without checking
out of his hotel.

<HEAD>Private Eye Wins Appeal on Libel Damages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court Thursday canceled the bulk of a
record $960,000 libel award against the satirical magazine Private
Eye and recommended tighter guidelines for juries in assessing
libel damages.
   Three judges dismissed the magazine's appeal but reduced to
$40,000 the damages awarded by a High Court jury in May to Sonia
Sutcliffe, the estranged wife of a mass murderer known as the
Yorkshire Ripper.
   ``This is what we hoped for,'' said Private Eye's managing
director, Dave Cash.
   ``We would like to think that this decision today will go some
way toward stemming the growing tide of libel actions and the trend
toward juries making absurdly high awards.''
   Britain's libel laws give juries freedom to set damages without
any guidance from judges. Those who allege they have been libeled
do not claim a set amount of damages and there are no upper or
lower limits on the amount juries can award.
   Judge Lord John Donaldson of the Court of Appeal said he could
not believe the High Court jury had appreciated how large their
award was.
   ``What is, I think, required is some guidance to juries in terms
which will assist them to appreciate the real value of large
sums,'' he said.
   Another judge, Sir Martin Nourse, said the award must have been
made on a wrong basis because, he said, without realizing they were
exceeding their function, the jurors included a very large sum to
make an example of the defendants.
   Legal experts said Thursday's decision could mark the end of
U.S.-style libel awards in British courts.
   ``Basically what the appeal court appears to be saying is that
they hope a judge will correct any misconceptions the jury might
have,'' said libel lawyer Andrew Stephenson.
   The court dismissed Private Eye's request for a retrial. The
magazine had said new evidence would justify its stories, which
claimed Mrs. Sutcliffe had tried to profit from her husband's
notoriety by selling her story to a newspaper. Mrs. Sutcliffe
denies that she sold her story.
   The judges deferred their decision on further reducing the
$40,000 in damages and said judgment on who will pay the $160,000
in court costs will come later.
   Mrs. Sutcliffe was not in court, but her lawyer, Eileen
Pembridge, said: ``Mrs. Sutcliffe is relieved that the matter is
nearly over and pleased that the judges have dismissed Private
Eye's new evidence.''
   Peter Sutcliffe was jailed for life in 1981 for killing 13 women
and attempting to kill five more. Mrs. Sutcliffe was not implicated
in any of the crimes.
   Irene MacDonald, whose 16-year-old daughter was among
Sutcliffe's victims, welcomed the ruling.
   ``This all boils down to money,'' she said. ``Events like this
bring all the awful memories back.''
   After the High Court ruling on May 24, Private Eye's editor, Ian
Hislop, declared: ``If this is justice, then I am a banana.''
   Hislop said Thursday that ``Lord Donaldson and his colleagues
have decided that I am not a banana. Our future looks a ... lot
better than it did.''
   The magazine asked readers for contributions to support its
appeal. If any of the $150,000 collected is left after court costs,
it will be given to a trust fund for relatives of the Yorkshire
Ripper's victims, Hislop said.

   A major drug manufacturer on Thursday
announced a new program to provide easily understood information to
patients about its most widely used prescription drugs.
   G.D. Searle and Co. said it was initiating the program in light
of a new survey showing that nearly half the drugs prescribed
yearly are taken incorrectly.
   The Bush administration, along with Sen. Orrin Hatch, ranking
Republican on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee,
endorsed the program as a voluntary, private sector effort
important to public health.
   Hatch called it ``a step forward that should be followed by
other pharmaceutical manufacturers in this country,'' but he said
he would not want the government to require companies to initiate
their own programs. ``I don't like to make matters mandatory if we
can do it on a voluntary basis,'' he said.
   The Food and Drug Administration requires drug companies to
provide to patients information on certain drugs, including birth
control pills. It also has encouraged companies to distribute
information voluntarily for some drugs that have more serious side
effects.
   An FDA program to require package inserts for 10 prescription
drugs was initiated during the late 1970s. But the program ran into
resistance from pharmacists, physicians and the prescription drug
industry and was scrapped in 1981, before it got off the ground.
   Consumer groups have long favored efforts to distribute more
information to patients about prescription drugs, and some
countries are moving in that direction. The European Economic
Community will require drug companies to distribute such
information beginning in January 1992.
   Sheldon G. Gilgore, Searle chairman, said the plan, which will
be instituted worldwide by the end of 1990, is the most
comprehensive voluntary patient-information program by a U.S. drug
company.
   He said the company initially will provide to physicians
information sheets they can give to patients explaining in
nontechnical terms the potential side effects of three drugs and
the possible interactions the medicines can have with other drugs.
   The three drugs are Calan and Calan SR, used to treat high blood
pressure, and Cytotec, an ulcer preventive. These account for about
three-quarters of Searle's nearly $1 billion in annual domestic
sales.
   Company officials said the rest of Searle's products, as well as
future products, will be covered by the program. About 15 percent
of the company's drug products are oral contraceptives, for which
the FDA already requires written information for patients.
   Searle said a telephone survey of 1,000 prescription drug users,
conducted during the last week of September by Pracon Inc. of
Reston, Va., said nearly half do not follow the dosage instructions
of their medicine.

<HEAD>Forty Cents of Every Dollar to Cleanup, OTA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's Superfund money has not been
spent wisely, with only some 40 percent going to clean up toxic
waste dumps, a congressional study said Thursday.
   ``Analysis breeds paralysis,'' the Office of Technology
Assessment said in noting that only about three dozen of the 1,200
priority cleanup sites have been declared completely clean.
   During the last three years, 60 percent of the $4.4 billion
spent by the Environmental Protection Agency on Superfund went for
administration, management or site studies rather than cleanup,
said a report from the Office of Technology Assessment.
   OTA concluded that while the EPA has estimated another 900 toxic
waste sites likely will be added to its priority list over the next
decade, the number could be 10 times that with a better
administered program.
   The report, entitled ``Coming Clean,'' said while private
Superfund contractors keep busy, ``reports pile up, contamination
spreads into soil and groundwater, many sites wait to get into the
(cleanup) system.''
   Lew Crampton, EPA associate administrator for communications and
public affairs, said the agency's figures show 60 to 70 percent of
the money is related to site cleanup. The percentage will increase
starting later this year, he said, when major construction work
begins on a number of sites.
   ``It depends on how you define what is spending directly on
cleanup and what is inefficient,'' he said, adding the agency has
asked OTA to explain its percentages.
   Crampton, defending preparatory studies, added, ``You can't
expect to stick a shovel in the ground and get rid of this stuff
(toxic waste).''
   Studies are needed to characterize the hazard, decide on the
proper remedy and test different technologies, all work that must
be handled by contractors, he said.
   Reps. John D. Dingell, D-Mich. and James Scheuer, D-N.Y. both
noted EPA Administrator William K. Reilly has taken steps to
improve Superfund.
   Dingell added ``the constructive aspects of the OTA report may
be overshadowed by its excessive emphasis on speculative
statistics.''
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., said the study ``paints a disturbing
picture which questions just how permanent and complete these
cleanups actually are and how wisely the money used to administer
the program has been spent.''
   The report said the Superfund's problem is not one of money, but
that funds too often were misdirected rather than aimed at reducing
the significant health and environmental threats posed by toxic
waste sites.
   Often, money spent directly on cleanup efforts went toward
``reducing hypothetical risks which may not materialize'' instead
of to dealing with immediate health threats, it said.
   At the same time, the report claimed that too often the
government has chosen _ or allowed the polluters themselves to
choose _ cleanup methods that ``are unlikely to work over the long
term.''
   In an attempt to reduce government costs, the EPA is getting
industry to assume more cleanup activities, but also is allowing
industry to use less stringent cleanup technologies, possibly
saving as much as $1 billion, the study said.

<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old girl was working so hard
on her school examination paper Thursday that she wasn't aware a
bullet had lodged in her hair.
   It was only after a classmate told Demetra Achilleos, ``Look,
you are dropping bullets from your hair,'' that she made the
unusual discovery.
   The incident occurred in this Greek Cypriot village in east
Cyprus, less than a mile from the fortified buffer zone dividing
the Mediterranean island.
   Demetra and other girls in her class were busy on a written test
when they heard a fusillade of shots from the zone. A window in the
classroom shattered and small pieces of plaster fell on their heads
from the ceiling.
   ``I felt something like a slight burning pain on top of my head
but I did not give it much thought at the time,'' Demetra said
later.
   ``I thought it was a piece of glass from the broken window. When
I realized what had happened and how close I had come to being
seriously hurt I became frightened and cried.''
   The bullet apparently hit her head after ricocheting off the
ceiling, with much of its force spent.
   Police asked U.N. peacekeepers who patrol the zone to
investigate.
   Dherynia villagers said shots are occasionally fired from the
Turkish lines toward the village, though nobody has been hurt.
   Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion.

   Talk about a gift that keeps on giving.
   Mark Smith, a 32-year-old Montrose man, won a $15,000 Mazda
Miata sportscar in a name-that-tune radio contest Wednesday and
promptly turned the prize over to the Red Cross fund to help
victims of the Northern California earthquake.
   Morning disc jockey Rick Dees and KIIS-FM management were
thunderstruck, so they decided to match Smith's $15,000 gift and
gave him another car.
   ``I still don't know what I'm going to do. I may yet give this
one up, too. It's been a crazy day,'' said Smith, a local YMCA
program director. Smith said he was concerned about victims of the
quake and, ``Hearing (Dees) talk about the Red Cross needing money
made me think of it.''
   ``It was a real catalyst,'' said Craig Rogers, an assistant to
Dees. ``Since Smith did that, we've been getting calls from
businesses wanting to donate money ... everyone is moved by this
guy's generosity.''
   A later contestant for the Miata also planned to give the cash
equivalent to the Red Cross if she won, and when she lost she gave
the $100 consolation prize instead.

   The Bush administration may speed up the
planned withdrawal of U.S. military dependents from Panama, the
White House said Thursday.
   Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, the newly appointed U.S. military
commander in Panama, also has recommended shortening soldiers' tour
of duty so that fewer bring their families to Panama, a Pentagon
official said.
   The United States imposed sanctions against Panama in March 1988
in a campaign to oust strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Noriega has held onto power, nullifying last May's elections and
installing a crony on Sept. 1 as president.
   U.S. officials last May began evacuating military dependents,
and as of July 1, some 6,300 Department of Defense personnel had
either been sent home or relocated onto U.S. bases in Panama, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   But there are still roughly 11,000 American dependents in the
country, said Fitzwater, who added, ``We are reviewing the issue
right now of whether or not that (withdrawal) should be
accelerated.''
   Currently, the United States has 10,000 soldiers permanently
assigned to Panama, 2,500 military personnel there on temporary
duty, 7,700 military dependents, 2,700 U.S. civilian Pentagon
employees and 3,300 civilian dependents.
   The ``ultimate purpose'' is to get family members back to the
United States, Fitzwater said.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said Thurman had
formally recommended to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that tours of
duty in Panama be reduced so that fewer soldiers bring families
with them to the troubled region.
   Thurman wants to cut from 15 months to 12 months the tour length
for those going alone to Panama.
   The standard tour for military personnel bringing family members
to Panama would be cut from 30 months to 24 months, and ``only a
very few'' would be allowed to remain there on a full 24-month
rotation, Williams said.
   Williams said Thurman's recommendations were designed ``to
ensure the security of all U.S. military members and their families
in Panama.''
   Thurman wanted to emphasize that while the U.S. forces have no
quarrel with the Panama Defense Forces, the American military
personnel serving in Panama must remember ``the situation is a
sustained, classic, low-itensity conflict,'' said Williams. ``Their
mission is counter-terrorism, their mission is protection of U.S.
military personnel and U.S. military assets.''
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States for drug
trafficking. On Oct. 3 he quashed an attempted coup that received
minimal support from U.S. forces.
   The withdrawal of dependents began last spring following a
series of incidents, including harassment and physical assaults
against some Americans.

<HEAD>US Urges Cuba To Respect UN Resolutions</HEAD>

   The State Department said Thursday that Cuba,
as a newly elected member of the U.N. Security Council, should
start showing respect for U.N. resolutions by ending assistance to
leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Cuba was one of five countries to be elected to Security Council
seats Wednesday. It is the first time Cuba has been chosen for a
seat since the 1959 revolution.
   ``We hope Cuba will recognize that it has a special
responsibility as a member of Security Council to act
constructively to end regional conflicts, not contribute to them,''
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   She said Cuba should bear in mind that the Central American
presidents have asked the United Nations to create a force to
ensure that no state provides support to irregular forces, which
include the Salvadoran rebel group known by its Spanish initials
FMLN.
   She noted that a U.N. resolution approved several weeks ago
called on all member states to halt all overt or covert aid to
insurrectional forces in Central America.
   ``Cuba is the principal violator of that Security Council
resolution and the principal arms supplier to the FMLN,'' she said.
``We hope its tenure on the Security Council will begin with Cuban
adherence to the resolution.''
   Cuba had the endorsement of other Latin American nations for the
Security Council seat. The action of the Latin American countries
suggested that the Bush administration's policy of hostility toward
Cuba is not widely shared elsewhere in the hemisphere.
   On a related subject, Ms. Tutwiler deplored the bombing in El
Salvador of the home of leftist political leader Ruben Zamora.
   On Wednesday, Ms. Tutwiler condemned the killing of the young
daughter of a military officer in El Salvador and Thursday, she
said, ``we condemn with equal vigor this reprehensible act against
Mr. Zamora and his family.''
   The spokeswoman said she not know who was responsible for the
attack.
   Ms. Tutwiler also responded to a report contending that the
Salvadoran military has conducted a nationwide campaign of
killings, harassment and torture against doctors and health care
workers and attacked rebel field hospitals in violation of the
Geneva Convention.
   Based on the report, written by seven Americans, including five
doctors, the U.S. government has requested specific information on
cases in which there were claims of harassment, she said.
   ``There is no evidence of a Salvadoran governmment policy of
harassment or abuse of health workers,'' she said. ``There is no
doubt that the provision of health care and services by the
government could be improved.''
   The team concluded that the alleged persecution of medical
personnel was part of a campaign to obstruct religious and relief
workers in order to undermine support for the guerrillas.

   The Pentagon has identified 18 weapons
produced in other nations as candidates for possible use by the
U.S. services, the Defense Department said Thursday.
   Under the Foreign Weapons Evaluation Program and the NATO
Comparative Test program, the weapons are evaluated to see if they
will meet the needs of U.S. forces ``more quickly or at a more
competitive cost,'' a Pentagon statement said.
   Among the weapons systems chosen for evaluation were the Dutch
``Goalkeeper'' close-in weapons system, which employs a 30mm
Gatling gun; the West German hand-held ``Diver Sonar'' system, and
the Israeli ``Gideon'' helmet-mounted optical device, which
attaches to night-vision goggles for pilots using the Cobra attack
helicopter.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Armenians, whose homeland was
devastated by an earthquake last December, met in Yerevan's central
square on Thursday night to organize aid for victims of the
California quake, an activist said.
   ``People came from all over, from factories, institutes, work
collectives,'' said Galstyan Ambartsumyan in a telephone interview.
``We are collecting money, clothing _ we just have to find out what
is needed.''
   Soviet authorities say 25,000 people died in the earthquake in
northwestern Armenia last year, many of them when shoddily built
apartment buildings collapsed. Aid flowed into the area from all
over the world, including the United States.
   The death toll in the northern California quake, which had the
same intensity of 6.9 on the Richter scale as the Armenian one, has
claimed more than 270 lives, authorities estimated.
   Amburtsyan said the crowd at Thursday's meeting was more than
happy to donate funds to the victims, ``but we only have Soviet
money'' _ which is worthless outside the Soviet Union.
   He is a member of the Karabakh Committee, which is spearheading
a call for Armenia to take over the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh in the neighboring southern republic of Azerbaijan.

   Private exporting companies have sold the
Soviet Union an additional 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Orders since Oct. 1, the beginning of the agreement's new year,
now total more than 5 million tons of corn, 143,700 tons of
soybeans and 325,000 tons of soybean meal.
   U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89 were a record of more than
21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn
and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat.
   In addition, 1988-89 sales included 1.35 million tons of soybean
meal and 1.02 million tons of grain sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 1.2 million tons
of corn would be more than 47 million bushels.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or further details were released.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.27 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA's five-day average, meaning that the
latest sale could have a farm value of about $107 million.

<HEAD>Old Stands to Receive More Protection Everywhere; Most Impact in
Northwest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New management policies, including fewer
controversial ``clear cuts,'' will be adopted to preserve more
old-growth trees in the national forests, the Forest Service said
Thursday.
   George M. Leonard, associate chief of the service, said he
guessed the new policies would preserve about half the nation's old
growth stands _ more in some areas, less in others, depending on
the tree species involved in and other things.
   ``Not all of the old growth is going to be preserved,'' he said.
``My guess it's going to be substantially over half of the
remaining old growth (that) will be preserved,'' he said.
   The new policies will have the greatest impact on old-growth
forests in the Pacific Northwest but will be applied to all forests
in the system, including eastern hardwoods and soft pines of the
South.
   The old-growth forests _ often never cut before, and
distinguished by old trees and accumulations of dead material _
provide living space for many species of wildlife, including the
controversial spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest.
   Congress recently approved compromise provisions aimed at
protecting the owl in $11.2 billion spending measure for the
Interior Department and related agencies like the Forest Service,
an arm of the Agriculture Department.
   The legislation, designed to permit continued logging in the
old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, calls on the Forest
Service and Interior's Bureau of Land Management to ``minimize
fragmentation of significant old-growth forest stand.'' No timber
sales would be allowed in areas already identified as spotted owl
habitat.
   Lawmakers sought a way to ensure Northwest mills of a steady
supply of timber from the region's old-growth forests while the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decides whether to declare the
northern spotted owl an endangered species.
   Such declarations require federal agencies to protect the
habitats of the species in question. The spotted owl lives almost
exclusively in old-growth forests and each nesting air requires a
very large area.
   Leonard said the Forest Service will reduce the use of
traditional clear-cutting methods in which all or most trees in an
area are cut, and will increase retention of snags, dead-and-down
material and logging debris that could be used by wildlife.
   Also some forest stands will be managed on ``extended
rotations'' to develop old-growth characteristics. Some of those
rotations would be for 150 to 200 years or longer.
   Agency Chief F. Dale Robertson said in a statement that ``we do
not anticipate an immediate impact on our timber sale program since
our forest plans provide for many old-growth values.''
   However, Robertson added that ``there will be an impact when we
complete the final forest plans in California, Oregon and
Washington, and as we amend or revise other forest plans due to a
greater emphasis on old-growth values.''
   Asked about wildlife species that might benefit from the new
policy's use in eastern hardwood forests, Leonard said the red
cockaded woodpecker in southern pine forests was one example but he
was not aware of any in old-growth hardwoods.
   ``But certainly we're looking at the impact of cutting and the
way we lay out our (timber) sales on bear habitat, on turkey
habitat,'' he said.
   Leonard said the recent years of controversy over old-growth
forests, the spotted owl and other environmental factors have been
fierce and will take time to heal.
   ``I've been involved in national forest management issues for
over 30 years, and I've never found a situation that was more
polarized than the issue over the management of the Pacific
Northwest,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Army lifted a two-month grounding order on
some of its CH-47D Chinook medium-lift helicopters Thursday, saying
it had identified vibration as the most probable cause of oil
cooling fan failures earlier this year.
   The grounding was ordered as a precautionary measure after oil
cooling fans failed on CH-47Ds at Fort Campbell, Ky., and Fort
Bragg, N.C. No one was injured in either incident, nor were the
aircraft damaged, the Army said in a statement.
   The Army said Thursday's order affected 211 of the 264
helicopters that had been grounded. Those helicopters had not
experienced fan failures. Vibration limits have been established
and those aircraft will be checked every 25 hours of flight time,
the statement said.
   The 53 Chinooks that remain grounded have experienced fan
failures in the past and will undergo ``further testing and
evaluation'' before they are approved for flight, the statement
said.

<TEXT>
   Rockets slammed into the capital's
airport and civilian flights were halted Thursday as the Soviet
Union was reported to be undertaking the largest airlift since its
military withdrawal eight months ago.
   The government said shelling in Kabul killed 12 people and
wounded 35, though two doctors at a hospital that monitors
casualties said they did not know of any victims.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas also shelled a strategic town near
the Pakistan border, killing nine people, the government said.
   Diplomatic sources in Kabul and Islamabad, Pakistan, said it was
the largest Soviet airlift since February, when Soviet troops ended
their nine-year intervention in Afghanistan.
   Diplomats in Kabul said Soviet-built Antonov-12 transport planes
were flying continuously into the airport, dropping off weapons and
food for soldiers. They said the planes were also flying night
missions.
   Two soldiers said all commercial traffic was shut down for most
of the afternoon but Soviet transport planes were operating despite
the shelling. Witnesses said at least five rockets hit the airport
grounds, but there were no immediate casualty or damage reports
there.
   U.S. Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., estimated Moscow has increased its
aid to $400 millinagers to take early
retirement.
   AT&amp;T outperformed its Bell offspring, which reported diverging
results. Profits rose 6.5 percent at Philadelphia-based Bell
Atlantic Corp., but fell 8.9 percent at Denver-based U S West Inc.,
fell 12.6 percent at San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group, and
fell 14.8 percent at strikebound Nynex Corp., based in White
Plains, N.Y.
   While AT&amp;T said it is not aiming to eliminate a specified number
of jobs, spokesman Burke Stinson said, ``It would not be
unreasonable for 5,000 to 15,000 managers to take advantage of the
plan.''
   Analysts praised AT&amp;T's cost-cutting step, saying the company
has too many managers in light of its sluggish sales of computers
and network equipment.
   ``They're doing exactly what I think they need to do,'' said Lap
Lee, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst.
   AT&amp;T will double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to
retire with immediate pension payments. It is also offering a
special sweetened pension plan for managers who choose to retire on
Dec. 30.
   AT&amp;T embarked on an aggressive cost-cutting program beginning in
1984, the year it lost its local operating companies in the breakup
of the Bell System.
   Since then the company has cut its payroll from 373,000 to
298,000. This is the first program aimed only at managers.
   The largest single job cut in the company's history came in late
1986, when AT&amp;T eliminated 32,000 jobs. The company has relied on
incentives when slashing employment, but Stinson noted that this is
the first ``pension sweetener'' in AT&amp;T history.
   ``We are in a topsy-turvy marketplace, and we need to have as
many people at the elbows of our customers as possible and as few
people in non-sales, behind-the-scenes jobs as possible,'' Stinson
said.
   The retirement option will increase expenses in the fourth
quarter, but the amount cannot be determined until the number of
participants is determined. The company said the higher expenses
would be offset by other items, including a gain from a share
exchange that ends its direct investment in Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co.
SpA.
   AT&amp;T reported profits rose 19 percent to $699 million, or 65
cents a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $587 million, or
55 cents a share a year ago. Revenue increased 1 percent to $8.9
billion from $8.81 billion in the third quarter a year ago.
   For the nine-month period, profit totaled $1.99 billion, or
$1.85 a share, up 19 percent from $1.67 billion, or $1.56 a share,
a year ago. Revenue increased 3 percent to $26.81 billion, from
$26.00 billion in the year-ago period.
   AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen said that while the company is
pleased with the results, ``we are keenly aware that we face stiff
competition in all our markets.''
   He said AT&amp;T will ``continue to be aggressive in the marketing
of our products and services, and aggressive as well in continuing
to drive costs out of every part of our business.''
   Bell Atlantic and U S West, two of the companies carved out of
AT&amp;T in the 1984 breakup, reported differing results. Bell Atlantic
attributed its gains partly to strong growth in telephone usage,
while U S West said its profit dip was the result of special
factors that masked ``modest earnings growth.''
   Bell Atlantic said its profit rose to $363.2 million, or $1.82 a
share, from $341 million, or $1.72 a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose to $2.91 billion from $2.76 billion.
   For the first nine months, Bell Atlantic said profit rose to
$1.07 billion, or $5.43 a share, from $1.01 billion, or $5.12 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $8.56 billion from $8.11
billion.
   U S West said profit fell to $258.1 million, or $1.39 a share,
from $283.2 million, or $1.55 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell
to $2.32 billion from $2.43 billion.
   ``Nevertheless, we're not satisfied with these results. The
major negative factor is the cumulative impact of regulatory
activity over the past two years on our telephone operations,''
said Jack McAllister, U S West's chairman and chief executive.
   For the year to date, U S West said earnings fell to $766.3
million, or $4.17 a share, from $860 million, or $4.68 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $7.15 billion from $6.87 billion a
year earlier.
   Nynex blamed a continuing strike by about 60,000 employees as a
factor in its downturn in its installation of phone lines and
delays in repairs and directory assistance. It said its
third-quarter earnings fell to $288.7 million, or $1.47 a share,
from $338.9 million, or $1.72 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
to $3.31 billion from $3.18 billion a year earlier.
   For the first nine months, Nynex earnings fell to $851.3
million, or $4.32 a share, from $972 million, or $4.90 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $9.84 billion from $9.42 billion.
   Pacific Telesis Group said earnings fell to $278 million, or 68
cents a share, from $318 million, or 75 cents a share, in the third
quarter of 1988, which had been the best third quarter in the
company's history. Revenue edged down to $2.37 billion from $2.38
billion.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Pacific Telesis
said earnings fell to $920 million, or $2.23 a share, from $939
million, or $2.22 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $7.12
billion from $7.06 billion.

   Former President Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
left Thursday morning for an 11-day trip to Japan with more than

Orient.
   The Reagans and the spouses and dependents of U.S. military

   The Reagans went to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese
government and the Fujisankei Communications Group. They will
attend several charitable events and meet with the prime minister,
emperor and other government figures.
   At the Reagans' suggestion, Fujisankei provided the jumbo jet,
said Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg.
   ``Nancy and I promised ourselves that if we ever had a chance to
bring families together, we would,'' Reagan said in a statement.
``When we learned we would have so many extra seats on the airplane
being provided to us, we knew immediately what to do.''
   The Reagans, who are expected to receive $1 million for their
charitable and public appearances in Japan, were to return Oct. 28.

   The Agriculture Department said Thursday it
will prohibit use of sodium nitrate in the processing of dry-cured
bacon, which makes up about 2 percent of the total bacon made in
the United States.
   Officials said also that the amount of sodium nitrite used in
the dry curing of bacon will be reduced. The regulation for both
will be effective Jan. 18, 1990.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said the move ``will help avoid any
health risk from nitrosamine formation when these types of bacon
are fried.''
   Nitrites can combine with amines in meat to form nitrosamines,
and certain types of those have been shown to cause cancer in
laboratory animals.
   About 98 percent of the bacon in the United States is made by
``pumping'' curing solutions containing nitrite into pork bellies.
The agency has prohibited nitrates and limited nitrites in the
pumping solutions since 1978.
   Nitrites are used in the curing of meat to guard against
spoilage and harmful organisms, and to give bacon a distinctive
color and taste.

   Americans touched by scenes of devastation, of people left
homeless by disaster, sent what they could to earthquake victims in
Northern California on Thursday just one month after shipping aid
to those in Hurricane Hugo's wake.
   Even Charleston, S.C., still reeling from last month's pounding
by Hugo, sent a plane load of bottled drinking water. And on the
other side of the globe, tens of thousands of Armenians organized
aid for California victims.
   Private groups and officials sent search dogs and special
equipment to hunt for survivors, donated blood and money and
offered their expertise. A Southern California man donated a
$15,000 sports car he won in a radio contest.
   Wyoming remembered the help it received from California
firefighters in the 1988 fires at Yellowstone National Park. Gov.
Mike Sullivan asked emergency officials to help with structural
inspections and search and rescue.
   ``While we are few in number and they are many, their needs are
many, and we stand ready to help in any way,'' Sullivan said.
   The Wyoming Red Cross sent a mass feeding van to California from
Casper to join other Red Cross units delivering hot food door to
door. The Red Cross also took cash donations for the relief effort.
   Missouri Red Cross officials said about a dozen staff members
and volunteers were still on the East Coast helping victims of
Hugo, but one person is preparing to head to San Francisco.
   ``It's been the double whammy,'' spokeswoman Colleen McQuillan
said. ``We're still trying to raise money to pay for Hugo and now
we need money for this.''
   The international headquarters of the Church of the Nazarene,
located in Kansas City, told its churches to pass the plate for
earthquake victims at Wednesday night services.
   ``We're getting calls from all over, `What are we going to do to
help?' We tell them to get money,'' said Steve Weber, coordinator
for the church's charity services.
   The Japanese Red Cross Society sent $35,000 to its American
counterpart for earthquake victims. In New York City, a group of
Manhattan co-workers donated the $50 in a World Series betting pool
to the Red Cross.
   In Yerevan, Soviet Armenia, tens of thousands of Armenians met
in the central square Thursday night to gather aid for California
quake victims, an activist said in a telephone interview.
   ``People came from all over, from factories, institutes, work
collectives,'' said Galstyan Ambartsumyan. ``We are collecting
money, clothing _we just have to find out what is needed.''
   Soviet authorities say 25,000 people died in an earthquake in
Armenia last year, many of them when shoddily built multi-story
apartment buildings collapsed. Aid flowed into the area from all
over the world.
   The Kansas City regional office of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, one of 10 nationwide, was unable to send help to
California.
   ``I have all of my capability committed to Hugo,'' said Warren
Pugh, the agency's division director of disaster assistance. ``I
don't really have anybody left to send out.''
   New York Air National Guard crews who joined hurricane relief
efforts in the Carribean and South Carolina flew to Northern
California. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey also
offered engineers to help assess the damage to buildings and
bridges.
   ``As you determine your priority needs, New York stands ready to
assist in any way we can,'' New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said.
   People in Charleston, S.C., had a special understanding of
natural disaster. They're still digging out from Hugo, which
smashed ashore on Sept. 21 with 135 mph wind. Relief poured in from
across the nation.
   The city sent bottled water and gasoline generators to
earthquake victims in the San Francisco Bay area, as well as five
police officers to help with emergency operations.
   ``I know we still have and will have great needs here and
charity certainly begins at home. However, it would be wrong for
this community ... not to reach in and contribute to those who are
hurt and suffering right now,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said.
   Closer to home, an Anheuser-Busch Inc. brewery 35 miles
northeast of San Francisco filled cans with drinking water instead
of beer for free shipment to relief agencies, the company said. The
Anheuser-Busch Foundation in St. Louis said it will donate $2
million along with food, clothing and water.
   And a cellular telephone company in Burlingame, Calif., offered
to lend free telephones to emergency service agencies.
   In San Francisco, lawyer Melvin Belli and his staff set up
tables in front of his downtown offices Wednesday, offering free
legal counsel. The attorneys' office building was apparently unsafe.
   The most unusual donation was probably from Mark Smith, who won
a Mazda Miata sportcar in a name-that-tune radio contest in Los
Angeles. Smith gave the car to the Red Cross earthquake fund.
   Morning disc jockey Rick Dees and KIIS-FM management decided to
match Smith's $15,000 gift and awarded him another car _ demanding
that he keep it.
   ``I still don't know what I'm going to do,'' said Smith, a YMCA
program director. ``I may yet give this one up, too. It's been a
crazy day.''
   Since Smith's gift, people and businesses began calling the
station wanting to donate money. A woman who lost the contest
donated her $100 consolation prize, said Craig Rogers, an assistant
to Dees.

   Czechoslovak police arrested former
Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek and 14 other activists, and briefly
detained a U.S. human rights monitor, in a raid Thursday on an
international human rights meeting in Prague.
   An emigre source said all the activists were freed by Thursday
evening.
   It was the fourth such crackdown in Czechoslovakia in recent
days, indicating the communist government does not intend to follow
Poland and Hungary into genuine dialogue with opposition groups.
   Detained briefly was Jeri Laber, an American who directs U.S.
Helsinki Watch, a group associated with the International Helsinki
Federation in Vienna. Ms. Laber, the only foreign national
involved, was released after a document check.
   Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel and another leading activist,
Vaclav Maly, escaped because those detained shouted warnings to
them to flee, the federation said.
   Rude Pravo, the Communist Party daily, has said anyone taking
part in street demonstrations to mark the anniversary Oct. 28 of
Czechoslovak independence in 1918 faces prosecution.
   At least five activists are in prison awaiting trial on charges
that could mean up to 10 years in jail. Dozens of others face
similar charges and almost constant harassment.
   Czechoslovakia's security forces have waged a campaign of
carefully targeted repression following mass anti-government
protests in January, detaining key activists and jailing
lesser-known figures whose arrest stirs less protest at home and
abroad than the trial earlier this year of Havel.
   The federation said uniformed and plainclothes police raided a
Prague cafe where representatives of the Czechoslovak Helsinki
Committee were to meet federation leaders and Ms. Laber.
   Among those detained were banned writer Eva Kanturkova and
philosopher Radim Palous, and fellow Charter 77 activists Ladislav
Lis, Rudolf Battek and Martin Palous.
   The raid came two days after five members of the Helsinki
Committee, including Hajek, were questioned by police after leaving
a meeting.
   On Wednesday, Czechoslovak TV and emigre sources reported five
little-known activists with another independent group, the Movement
for Civil Liberties, have been charged with subversion. That could
put them in jail for up to three years.
   Two of the five are still in custody following their detention
Oct. 13, the emigre sources said.
   Last week, independent journalists Rudolf Zeman and Jiri Ruml,
editors of the popular underground monthly Lidove Noviny, were
arrested and charged with incitement, which carries a five-year
jail sentence.
   In Paris Thursday, the International Federation of Newspaper
Publishers demanded authorities release Ruml and Zeman, saying
their only crime was ``to pursue the cause of freedom of
expression.''
   In addition, a leading rights and Roman Catholic activist in the
Slovak capital of Bratislava, Jan Carnogursky, has been in
detention since August on charges that could jail him for up to 10
years.

<HEAD>Hooks: Blacks Will Form New Group to Fight Social Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks said
Thursday that a new group will soon be formed to better coordinate
black organizations' efforts to pull other blacks out of the
underclass.
   He said the group, which has no name yet, will be a
clearinghouse for ideas that the many black oriented and controlled
organizations can use to fight poverty, teen-age pregnancy, drugs,
AIDS, crime and other problems that are dragging down a large
segment of the population.
   ``I happen to believe the might of the black community is large
enough'' to do something about these problems, the leader of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said at
a press conference.
   ``Not counting the churches, there are 2 million black people in
organized groups,'' he said.
   He said he envisions a ``war on poverty using sweat and tears''
of volunteers. However, he said, ``We don't intend to let the
federal government off the hook.''
   At a three-day meeting starting Oct. 29, billed a ``conference
on the present crisis,'' the NAACP will form the new group and make
plans to lobby Congress for legislative relief from recent Supreme
Court decisions viewed as setbacks to civil rights.
   The gathering is a follow-up to the Aug. 26 march on Washington
that protested those decisions, Hooks said.
   He said legislation is being drafted by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., that the NAACP hopes ``can pass muster with the very
conservative court.''

   Camilo Jose Cela, a Spanish writer
whose violent, grotesque images sprang from the civil war that
killed more than 1 million of his countrymen, won the Nobel Prize
for literature Thursday.
   The Swedish Academy cited Cela, 73, for ``rich and intensive
prose, which with restrained compassion forms a challenging vision
of man's vulnerability.''
   It said his novel ``The Family of Pascual Duarte,'' published in
1942, was the most popular work of fiction in Spanish since Miguel
Cervantes' masterpiece ``Don Quixote'' was published nearly 400
years ago.
   ``I understand that this is the culmination of my literary
career after many years of work,'' Cela told Swedish radio from his
home in Guadalajara, 30 miles northeast of Madrid.
   ``I offer it to all of literature in Spanish. I believe that
other authors, Spanish and Latin American, who write in Spanish
could also have won it for the same reasons as I.''
   Cela, a bon vivant known in Spain for his flamboyant lifestyle,
told reporters over lunch in Madrid that ``life is like a game of
tennis, and this time I won.''
   He said he would use the $463,000 prize ``to pay my debts, and
believe me, I've got a lot of them.''
   In the 47 years since ``Pascual Duarte,'' Cela said, ``what I
have gained in wisdom I've been losing in vigor and health, and
what I have gained in experience I've lost in freshness.''
   As an epitaph, he said, he would like: ``Here lies someone who
tried to screw his fellow man as little as possible.''
   His 10 novels and 60 other works _ short stories, essays, poetry
and travel books _ have made Cela ``the leading figure in Spain's
literary renewal during the postwar era,'' the Swedish Academy
said. He is the fifth Spanish writer to receive the literature
prize.
   Sture Allen, the academy's secretary, said Cela also had wide
influence on literature throughout Latin America.
   ``He is an experimental and provocative writer, both regarding
form and contents,'' Allen said. ``Furthermore, he broadened the
range of the Spanish language.''
   Asked to compare Cela with another experimental Spanish writer,
Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru, Allen described both as individualists
who were ``apparently acquainted with each others' works.''
   Allen suggested that readers unfamiliar with Cela begin with
travel writings in which ``he tried to capture the Spain he saw
disappearing, and maybe some of the Spanish national spirit.''
   In ``The Family of Pascual Duarte,'' his best-known work, Cela
created a new style known as ``tremendismo'' that emphasized
violence and grotesque imagery. The novel, a first-person account
of a murderer awaiting execution, was banned in Spain but
established Cela's reputation as a writer.
   ``Requiem of Darkness 5'' (1973) and ``Mazurka for Two Dead''
(1983) carried Cela's experimental style further.
   His masterpiece is considered to be ``The Hive,'' published in
1951. It describes three days in the life of Madrid four years
after the civil war ended in 1939.
   The war, which lasted three years and brought Gen. Francisco
Franco to power, often played an important role in Cela's works.
   He is a native of Galicia, a Franco stronghold in northwestern
Spain. After returning from studies in Madrid with tuberculosis, he
was recruited by the fascists, suffered the horrors of war and was
sent home with serious wounds.
   Despite his service in the Franco forces, Cela was strongly
anti-fascist. From 1956 to 1979, he published Papeles de Son
Armadans, a magazine that became a forum for the young opposition.
Franco died in 1975.
   The author was born May 11, 1916, in the town of Ira Flavia to a
middle class family that counted among its forebearers both Spanish
aristocrats and English pirates.
   Before the civil war began in 1936, he studied medicine and law.
He turned to writing full-time after the success of ``The Family of
Pascual Duarte.''
   In 1977, King Juan Carlos appointed Cela to a Senate seat in the
first post-Franco parliament, and he participated the next year in
writing a new constitution.
   He received the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature in 1987
and has been a member of the Spanish Academy literary group since
1957.
   Cela is the first Spaniard to win the literature prize since the
poet Vicente Aleixandre in 1977 and the first Spanish-language
writer since Gabriel Garcia Marquez of Colombia in 1982. The other
winners from Spain were poet Juan Ramon Jimenez in 1956 and
playwrights Jose Echegaray and Jacinto Benavente in 1904 and 1922.
   The Nobel Prize in literature was the last of the six prizes
awarded for 1989, each worth $463,000.
   The Dalai Lama, exiled spiritual and political leader of Tibet,
won the Nobel Peace Prize.
   Other winners were J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus of the
United States, medicine; Trygve Haavelmo of Norway, economics;
Thomas Cech, an American, and Canadian-born Sidney Altman, a U.S.
citizen since 1984, chemistry; Norman F. Ramsey and Hans G.
Dehmelt, both Americans, and Wolfgang Paul, West German, physics.
   Alfred Nobel of Sweden, who invented dynamite and made a
fortune, provided for the prizes in his will. The first awards were
made in 1901.

   The House on Thursday gave overwhelming
approval to an $837 million aid package for Poland and Hungary that
nearly doubles what President Bush has requested.
   The vote of 345-47 sent the measure to the Senate.
   ``The ice of the Cold War is rapidly melting,'' said Rep. David
Bonior, D-Mich., during debate. ``We have a unique opportunity to
seize a very special moment in history. With our help, the march of
freedom in Eastern Europe will become irreversible.''
   The package was brought to the House floor with unusual speed,
just 15 days after it was introduced. The urgency was an indication
of Congress' eagerness to swiftly reward Poland and Hungary for
their moves toward democracy and free-market economic reform, as
well as Democrats' desire to underscore what they call Bush's
``timid'' response to the sweeping changes in the East Bloc.
   ``The administration has failed to grasp that this is a critical
turning point in the history of East-West relations,'' said Bonior,
a senior member of the chamber's Democratic leadership.
   The package has a three-year price tag of $837.3 million,
compared to the $450 million Bush has sought. During a trip to
Eastern Europe in July, the president originally proposed about
$150 million in aid, and has ratcheted the amount upward since then
in the face of congressional criticism.
   House Republicans flocked to the bill. One, Rep. Jim Leach of
Iowa, said the bill was ``an extraordinarily cheap way of helping
redirect the course of history.''
   The situation clearly has made administration officials
uncomfortable. In a policy statement, the White House said it would
generally support the bill but ``has reservations about the
excessive funding levels'' and would work to decrease the amount
when the bill goes to the Senate.
   Included in the package were:
   _A $200 million grant to help stabilize Poland's economy. That
would be the U.S. contribution to a $1 billion multilateral fund
sought by Poland.
   _$160 million for Poland and $40 million for Hungary to promote
private enterprise.
   _$10 million to set up a technical training program in business
skills for Poles and Hungarians, plus $4 million for Poland and $1
million for Hungary for programs in job training, labor-management
relations and occupational health and safety.
   _Up to $125 million in food aid for Poland.
   _$200 million in short-term guarantees and insurance for U.S.
exporters selling products to the two countries.
   _$30 million for clean coal-burning technology for Poland, and
$10 million for other environmental protection programs for both
countries.
   In addition, the bill provided $12 million for building
democratic institutions in Poland and Hungary, possibly through the
National Endowment for Democracy, and money for the Peace Corps,
cultural exchanges, scientific projects and medical aid.
   In an ironic twist, the bill uses some of the money aimed at
helping the Solidarity government, an estimated $37.5 million, to
subsidize U.S. maritime unions, because it requires that 75 percent
of food aid be shipped on more expensive U.S. vessels. An effort to
trim that subsidy, mostly pressed by farm-state lawmakers, failed
228 to 170.
   Last June, in the first open elections in four decades,
candidates of the trade union Solidrity won enough seats to take
control of Poland's government. A week ago, the new government
outlined plans for sweeping economic reforms.
   Hungary this year became the first Warsaw Pact nation to
physically dismantle the Iron Curtain and opened its borders to
allow East Germans to flee to the West. It is developing a new
multi-party political system under a liberalized constitution and
plans parliamentary elections early next year.
   But serious problems in both countries pose a threat to the
reforms.
   With inflation running at an annual rate of 200 percent and
climbing, food shortages, and a $39 billion foreign debt burden,
leaders of the fledgling Polish government face particularly
crucial tests.
   The aid package will help relieve economic pressures and buy
time for the new leaders to institutionalize their reforms,
proponents said, and keep alive the prospects for change in the
rest of Eastern Europe.
   Citizens in Germany, Romania and Czechoslovakia are watching
what is happening in Poland and Hungary, said Rep. Stephen Solarz,
D-N.Y. ``If these experiments fail, it will stifle the prospects
for political and economic reform in the other countries,'' he said.

   Dan Lai buried his face in his hands,
sobbing as he sat grief-stricken Thursday on a curb outside the
rubble of a four-story apartment building where two of his friends
died in the earthquake.
   ``I came here and it was gone. It happened so fast,'' said Lai,
26, who learned of the deaths when he came to check on their
building. For him, like other Californians, the earthquake not only
jumbled a landscape but heaved up grief and misery that clashed
with a laid-back lifestyle.
   Damage was heaviest in the Marina district, a trendy, upscale
neighborhood of pastel buildings, stucco facades and terra-cotta
roofs with a view of the spires of the Golden Gate Bridge and the
mountains across San Pablo Bay, drenched on Thursday with the
golden California sunshine.
   One section of the Bay Bridge linking Oakland and San Francisco
caved in, giving it the look of an alligator with its jaw stuck.
   San Franciscans whose lives revolve around their cars endured
clogged or closed freeways and city traffic snarled by non-working
traffic lights.
   Other changes were less subtle.
   Joggers whizzed past carcasses of collapsed buildings without
breaking stride. Tanned people in athletic wear toted tennis
rackets and bought fruit juice chilled in ice buckets.
Skateboarders and bicyclists competed with cars on streets. But the
air carried the scent of leaking natural gas and sounds of sirens,
generators, heavy equipment, helicopters and crackling police
radios.
   Evacuees carrying coolers, suitcases and boxes of belongings
competed for sidewalk space with tourists hefting video cameras and
snapping pictures.
   ``It's bad enough we're going through what we are without the
picture-taking. The tourists think this is a carnival,'' said Marie
Plaja, 71, sitting on a curb outside a Red Cross shelter where she
spent the night. She carried a Red Cross bag filled with
essentials, including lipstick and an emery board.
   One woman openly and randomly admonished those viewing the
wreckage.
   ``San Francisco has survived another earthquake. We've come
through. We're not a city of kooks or something that falls apart.
We are survivors,'' said Cynthia Woods, talking loudly to no one in
particular.
   On Chestnut Street, Pete Pallari set up his own emergency
kitchen to feed neighbors with leftovers from his restaurant, the O
Sole Mio Pizzeria. Cooking was done on a gas grill and a charcoal
fire, and the menu ranged from bacon and eggs to soup and French
bread.
   ``My refrigeration was gone, so it was either throw it away or
give it away. I couldn't save it,'' said Pallari, 42, operating
from the back of a pickup truck in an alleyway.
   Sanitation workers shoveled debris into garbage trucks,
including bricks and concrete shaken from buildings.
   The people who were ordered from their Marina district homes
because of the fear of leaking gas did what they could to get back
to normal. Junior Gale, who was staying at a hotel that still
lacked electricity, put her name on a waiting list for hot water so
she could wash her hair.
   Jim Braden, 38, was on his way to his law office with the
clothes he was wearing Tuesday _ surfer T-shirt, gray sweat pants
and brown dress shoes. ``My boss told me to come in with whatever I
was wearing,'' Braden said.
   In a gas station parking lot, Nita Blake sold $10 T-shirts that
said, ``Earthquake Survivor, 5:04 p.m. Oct. 17, 1989, the time and
day that the quake hit. Ten hours after that time she had 1,000
printed up. ``It was the biggest earthquake since 1906, so we
wanted to mark the occasion,'' she said.
   Pubs and taprooms stayed open despite lack of refrigeration and
ice. At Bachelors II, bartender Fred Miller stored dirty glasses in
boxes because he had no water to wash them. He served cocktails and
beer over ice in foam cups.
   At a nearby tavern, patrons drank by candlelight and toasted
their survival. ``We're glad were all here,'' said bartender Dick
Welsh. ``Some of our homes may be a shambles, but they can be
replaced. Life can't.''

<TEXT>
   A coalition of Amazon Indians from five Latin
American countries met Thursday with major U.S. environmental
groups to demand inclusion in consideration of the conservation of
the world's largest rainforest and the safeguarding of their native
lands and rights.
   ``The time has come for the indigenous people of the Amazon, the
people who have always lived there, to take a place at the table as
well,'' said Evaristo Nugkuag, president of the coalition known by
its Spanish acronym COICA.
   Representatives of the countries _ Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Bolivia and Brazil _ have also met this week with officials of the
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank to demand that
development programs undertaken by these institutions be
coordinated with the native inhabitants.
   Wilfrido Aragon Aranda of Ecuador said indigenous people had
been expelled from their lands to make way for hydroelectric
projects, because Latin American governments do not respect Indian
rights. ``We told them that we are now organized and we want them
to deal directly with us, and also to press our governments to
comply with protection laws of our rights,'' he said.
   Noted U.S. environmentalists, including Thomas Lovejoy of the
Smithsonian Institution, promised to respond to the Indians'
concerns and to lobby for their rights. ``We're deeply grateful for
this initiative,'' Lovejoy said at a news conference.
   Barbara Bramble of the National Wildlife Fund said her
organization would lobby the World Bank and other institutions to
make sure they deal directly with the Indians on development
projects.
   The World Bank has begun focusing attention this year on
conservation projects, after being accused of environmental
destruction through development projects such as road and dam
construction in the Third World.
   World attention has been increasingly turned to the destruction
of the 2 million square-mile Amazon forest, mainly through burning,
for farming, ranching, highway building and mining. The United
Nations and other bodies have proposed so-called ``debt for nature
swaps,'' in which they would use some of South America's $112
billion debt to invest in Amazon protection programs.
   But Nugkuag rejected the idea, saying the Indians of the Amazon
have never received money from their governments and had not
contributed to the debt problem. ``But still, they're talking about
giving away our lands to pay their debts,'' he said.
   Instead, he suggested, environmentalists should swap debt for
projects protecting indigenous lands and peoples, which would be
the best guarantee of the forest's conservation, as well.
   ``The focus of concern of the environmental community has been
the preservation of the tropical forests and its plants and animal
inhabitants,'' said a statement issued by the group. ``You have
shown little interest in its human inhabitants.''
   A second meeting to discuss specific ways of advancing the goals
adopted at Thursday's meeting will be held next year in Peru,
organizers said.

<TEXT>
   Unlike Spain's four other Nobel laureates
in literature, Camilo Jose Cela is a public figure, better known as
a bon vivant than for his 10 novels and other writings.
   His best-known novels, ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' (1942)
and ``The Hive'' (1951), have been made into successful movies, and
many Spaniards have encountered the author during his trips through
the country in a Rolls Royce.
   Cela, 73, most recently made news with the public disclosure of
a romantic liaison with Marina Castano, a woman half his age who is
his muse and literary aide.
   He is separated but not divorced from his wife of many years and
has a son, Camilo Jose Cela, who said last week that having such a
flamboyant father was difficult.
   His wife, Rosario Conde, said Thursday from her home in Palma de
Majorca the prize was well deserved and she would accompany her
husband to the awards ceremony in Stockholm. She added: ``If I
don't go, there's no prize.''
   Before he rushed off to a weekly television talk show appearance
Thursday, the Nobel laureate and Ms. Castano spoke with reporters
over a quick lunch at a Madrid hotel. She said he still writes
everything in longhand and has no idea how to operate a typewriter
or word processor.
   Cela, who has produced 70 works that include essays, poems and
travel books, said he was ``not really surprised'' by the award and
the prize could just as well have gone to many other Spanish
writers.
   ``But life is like a game of tennis, and this time I won,'' he
said, adding that the $463,000 prize would ``come in very handy.''
   ``I'll use it to pay my debts, and believe me, I've got a lot of
them,'' he said.
   Andreu Teixedor of Editorial Destino, which publishes Cela's
work in Spanish, said ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' had sold
more than 1 million copies in Spain and Latin America.
   In the 47 years since ``Pascual Duarte,'' Cela said Thursday,
``what I have gained in wisdom I've been losing in vigor and
health, and what I have gained in experience I've lost in
freshness.''
   Using the crude language common to his fiction, Cela said he
would like this epitaph: ``Here lies someone who tried to screw his
fellow man as little as possible.''
   The author said Spain, which produced ``Don Quixote,'' had been
overshadowed in literature by Latin America because of the
country's ``foolish provincialism.''
   ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' often is credited with creating
a sort of literary vanguard in the years immediately after the
civil war of 1936-39. It was published first in Argentina because
it was deemed too violent and crude for the Spain of Gen. Francisco
Franco.
   It is the tale, told in graphic language, of a rude man from the
country who commits a series of brutal murders without really
knowing why and eventually is executed by garrote.
   His novel ``The Hive'' is set in the years just after the war,
when the rest of the world was fighting. It tells of struggling
writers who sit for hours during the winter in Madrid's tolerant,
well-heated literary cafes, nursing a cup of imitation coffee and
trying to keep culture alive.
   Cela, the first Spanish novelist to win the Nobel, said Thursday
he had a work in progress, but he would not describe it.
   ``You never really know how these things are going to turn out
until the end,'' he said.
   Spanish poet Juan Ramon Jimenez won the Nobel literature prize
in 1956 and in 1977, two years after Franco died, it went to
Vicente Aleixandre, an obscure poet. The nation's first literary
laureate was playwright Jose Echegaray in 1904 and another
playwright, Jacinto Benavente, won in 1922.

   Farmers have developed conservation plans for
133 million acres of highly erodible cropland, about 98 percent of
the goal, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said the goal is to have plans drawn up on all the
eligible land by the Dec. 31 deadline.
   Under the 1985 farm law, farmers must be actively applying a
conservation plan on their highly erodible fields by the beginning
of the 1990 calendar year and have that plan fully implemented by
Dec. 31, 1994, if they want to stay eligible for USDA farm program
benefits.

   The interior minister on Thursday called Boris N.
Yeltsin a liar and said the maverick Communist concocted a phony
tale of his own kidnap and attempted assassination apparently to
help his political popularity.
   ``He invented the entire story,'' said Interior Minister Vadim
V. Bakatin at a hastily called news conference. ``What the reason
was, I don't know. You should ask him.''
   Bakatin, the top Soviet policeman, said that by exposing the
populist lawmaker's alleged falsehood and rumors it spawned, ``we
have simply prevented a new outburst of popularity for Yeltsin.''
Yeltsin could not be reached for comment.
   It was the lastest twist in Yeltsin's remarkable career, which
has seen him ousted from his post as the Communist Party leader in
Moscow in 1987, only to stage a stunning comeback in legislative
elections this year.
   The interior minister spoke less than 24 hours after Yeltsin
issued a statement accusing his former mentor, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, of staging a nationally televised ``political farce'' to
scuttle his political career.
   Before the cameras of state-run TV on Monday, Bakatin told the
Supreme Soviet legislature that Yeltsin, an anti-establishment hero
to millions of Soviets, appeared at a police post Sept. 28. Yeltsin
was dripping wet, and falsely reported that men in a car had
abducted him, put a sack over his head and tossed him from a bridge
into the Moscow River, Bakatin said.
   When he was given the floor, Yeltsin, 58, denied to fellow
lawmakers that he had ever made a formal police report of such an
incident or that an attack occurred. But he did not say whether he
had approached a policeman informally with such a story.
   In his toughly worded statement Wednesday, Yeltsin called the
glaring public exposure given his reputed claims ``a new attempt to
ruin my health and to knock me out of the sphere of political
struggle.'' He claimed Gorbachev was responsible.
   Bakatin's rapid appearance before reporters showed the Kremlin
was eager to counter Yeltsin's accusations.
   Yeltsin, a strapping, silver-haired Siberian who calls for an
end to official privilege and a better life for the average Soviet,
enjoys wide popular support, which seems to boom every time people
here perceive he has been targeted for attack by officialdom.
   Bakatin claimed that if any lies were being told about the
supposed kidnapping, they were coming from Yeltsin. ``I stated only
what Comrade Yeltsin told the policeman,'' Bakatin said. ``There
was no attempt on his life. These rumors are false.''
   He said Yeltsin ``lied publicly'' when he told his story to the
Supreme Soviet, and a second time a day later when he issued the
statement to the press accusing Gorbachev of staging a farce.
   Pressed to say what lies Yeltsin had told, Bakatin referred to
the lawmaker's statement claiming Bakatin mixed ``truth and lies''
in his report to the Supreme Soviet on the investigation into the
incident.
   He also said Yeltsin's alleged story to police couldn't possibly
be true.
   ``We know the terrain,'' Bakatin said. ``One can't be thrown
from the bridge into the water without suffering serious injuries.
There's also the time factor _ one can't do all these things in one
hour.''
   He suggested Yeltsin lied to police for political ends. ``This
is my personal guess, and it's nothing but a guess, that this false
declaration by Comrade Yeltsin was made on purpose: to distribute
information of interest to him,'' Bakatin said. ``He tried to gain
something by making those statements. Time will show how he
succeeds.''
   By puncturing the rumors sweeping Moscow that an attempt was
made on Yeltsin's life, ``we are putting an end to unfounded rumors
of political persecution,'' he said.
   However, evident official attempts in the past to discredit
Yeltsin have misfired badly. The Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee, to which Yeltsin belongs, launched an
investigation into charges that his views violate the party line,
but 89 percent of Moscow voters subsequently elected him to the new
Soviet parliament in March.
   Last month, Pravda reprinted an article from an Italian
newspaper that claimed Yeltsin boozed and shopped his way through a
U.S. speaking tour, but later had to print a public apology
admitting the allegations were hearsay that couldn't be documented.
   Thousands of Muscovites formed a chain on Gorky Street to show
their support for Yeltsin, who was named Moscow party boss by
Gorbachev in December 1985 but fired less than two years later for
criticizing the slow pace of the Kremlin leader's reforms.
   Asked if Yeltsin would be prosecuted under Article 130 of the
Soviet criminal code for allegedly filing a false police report,
Bakatin said there were no such plans. Besides, he said, Yeltsin's
status as a lawmaker means his fellow legislators would have to
sanction any criminal investigation of him.

   After a round of public recriminations, the
State Department sought Thursday to smooth over its differences
with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and denied the Bush
administration was trying to steer him into negotiations with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Shamir, vowing not to yield on basic principles, this week
questioned the strategy Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
following in trying to implement the prime minister's proposal for
Palestinian elections.
   Shamir questions the need for an Israeli meeting with
Palestinians in Cairo before the elections, seeing such a session
as pre-empting the talks that would be held with elected
Palestinian representatives from the West Bank and Gaza.
   The State Department, in response, on Wednesday accused Shamir
of hindering the attempt to arrange negotiations with what the
department characterized as unhelpful and disappointing remarks.
   On Thursday, however, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said
Shamir had sent a letter to Baker ``that applauds our efforts and
encourages us to keep them up.''
   At the same time, she said:
   ``The United States is not trying to get the Israelis to
negotiate with the PLO. We are trying to get the Israelis and the
Palestinians together behind the Shamir election proposal.''
   Baker had already assured the prime minister that Israel would
have to be ``satisfied'' with the composition of any Palestinian
delegation. But Baker also has supported Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's effort to negotiate the selection with the PLO.
   The PLO Central Council, meanwhile, rejected Baker's five-point
proposal at a meeting this week in Baghdad, Iraq.
   Still, Ms. Tutwiler rejected reports from Egypt and Israel that
the U.S. initiative had come to a stop. ``Every single thing that I
know certainly leads me to believe that we're all still engaged,''
she said. ``Nothing's changed.''
   The PLO has denounced Shamir's proposal as a ploy designed to
avert creation of a Palestinian state on Israeli-held land. Shamir,
meanwhile, has ruled out any negotiations with the PLO or including
PLO members in any Palestinian delegation.

   A white-supremacist ``skinhead'' was
sentenced to up to 20 years in prison Thursday for helping beat a
black immigrant to death.
   Multnomah County Circuit Judge Robert Redding sentenced Kyle H.
Brewster, 19, of Portland to 10 to 20 years on one count of
first-degree manslaughter in the November slaying of Mulegta Seraw,
said Redding's law clerk, Jon Ghastin.
   Seraw, a 27-year-old Ethiopian, was killed near his home last
November by three neo-Nazi racists, police said.
   Brewster pleaded guilty Sept. 1 to the manslaughter charge, one
count of first-degree assault and three charges of intimidation.
   He was sentenced to 10 years on the assault charge and five
years each on two of the intimidation charges. The sentences were
to run concurrently with the manslaughter sentence.
   One of the other men involved in the attack, Kenneth Mieske, 23,
admitted beating Seraw with a baseball bat, and pleaded guilty to
murder. He was sentenced to life in prison June 5.
   The third man, Steven Strasser, 20, is awaiting trial.
   Police said the three were members of a neo-Nazi, white
supremacist gang called East Side White Pride. Portland is a
stronghold for white-supremacist gangs, according to a federal
prosecutor.
   The skinhead subculture, so-called because its members sport
severely short haircuts, originated in London in the 1960s.
Segments of the movement took on Nazi overtones in recent years,
and since have been supported by and associated with
white-supremacist groups.

<HEAD>Expect Higher Milk Prices, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The farm price of milk has climbed steadily,
meaning prices at the grocery store will climb briskly for the rest
of 1989, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   ``Dairy markets are tight because of strong cheese sales,
non-fat dry milk exports and weakness in milk production,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said.
   ``However, the size of the price increases largely was
determined by the time of events,'' the report said. ``Milk
production unexpectedly collapsed at midyear, after commitments had
been made for large exports of non-fat dry milk and after
cheesemakers had decided to delay rebuilding of cheese stock until
the flush season'' of higher milk production last spring.
   But analysts said that milk output probably will rise above
year-earlier levels in 1990 and that ``seasonal easing'' should
eliminate supply problems.
   ``Dairy prices will drop from this autumn's highs,'' the report
said. ``By next spring, prices may be below a year earlier.''
   The farm price of milk in 1989 may average ``slightly more than
$1 above'' last year's $12.24 per 100 pounds, the report said. In
1990, the price may average below the 1988 level.
   ``Retail prices of milk and dairy products were slower to start
rising than farm or wholesale prices. However, increases in retail
prices will be brisk during the rest of 1989,'' the report said.
``For the first time in many years, rises in retail dairy prices
will surpass those of all food or all (consumer) items.''
   Consumer food prices overall are currently forecast by USDA to
rise an average of 5 percent to 7 percent this year, compared with
a 4.1 percent gain in 1988.

   Unusually early snow fell Thursday across parts of the Midwest,
and temperatures dropped to record lows across the Plains.
   It was the earliest snowfall on record for many cities,
including Cincinnati; Dayton, Ohio; Indianapolis; Fort Wayne, Ind.,
and St. Louis.
   About 6 inches of snow fell overnight and in the morning over
sections of Indiana.
   By midday, snow was falling over lower Michigan, Illinois,
Indiana and western Kentucky.
   Snowfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included 4 inches
in Fort Wayne and Indianapolis; 3 inches in Grand Rapids, Mich.;
and 2 inches in Detroit and Flint, Mich.
   Rain extended from southern New York and southern New England
into North Carolina, and from Ohio to Tennessee, northern
Mississippi and northern Alabama. Showers and thunderstorms fell in
southern and central Florida.
   Winter-like air settled over the central half of the nation.
   Record lows for the date were posted in North Platte, Neb.,
where it was 11 degrees; Valentine, Neb., 13; San Angelo, Texas,
28; Hot Springs, Ark., 31; Wichita Falls, Texas, 30; Mena, Ark.,
33; Waco, Texas, and Houston, both 37; San Antonio, Del Rio and
Fort Worth, Texas, all 38; Austin, Texas, 42; Victoria, Texas, 44;
and Galveston, Texas, 47.
   Frost and freeze warnings into Friday morning were posted for
sections of Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Unseasonably low
temperatures were forecast for much of Florida.
   At the other extreme, Miami International Airport reported a
record high for the date of 91 degrees, and Key West, Fla., tied
its record of 89.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees in Bloomington, Ill.; Bloomington, Ind., and Muskegon,
Mich., to 91 in Palm Springs, Calif. Thursday's low for the Lower
48 states was 4 degrees in Gunnison, Colo.

   Three people wrongly convicted 14 years ago for an
IRA bombing walked free Thursday, while the government began an
inquiry into police actions that led an appeals court to reverse
the convictions.
   One other man cleared in the pub bombing case was taken to
Belfast where his attorneys sought bail pending an appeal of an
unrelated murder conviction.
   ``This is a very grave matter for all who care about justice,''
Home Secretary Douglas Hurd told the House of Commons.
   The appeals court ruling climaxed years of effort by relatives,
former government officials, church leaders and journalists to
overturn the verdict, and focused new attention on two other
bombing cases from the 1970s.
   The sentence of the four had been upheld in 1977 even though
members of an IRA gang made detailed confessions in the case.
   ``I've been in prison for 15 years for something I didn't do.
I'm totally innocent,'' Gerard Conlon told cheering well-wishers
outside the Old Bailey following his release.
   ``If you're Irish, and you're arrested on a terrorist, political
type of offense, you don't stand a chance. You just don't stand a
chance,'' Conlon said in an interview with Independent Television
News.
   The appeals court threw out the convictions of Conlon, 35,
Patrick Armstrong, 39, and Paul Hill, 35, all of Belfast, and
Carole Richardson, 32, of London, in the bombing of a pub in
Guildford, southwest of London, on Oct. 5, 1974.
   All had been sentenced to life in prison. ``Thank God we've not
got capital punishment,'' Conlon's attorney Anthony Scrivener told
the court.
   The convictions of Armstrong and Hill for a pub bombing in the
London suburb of Woolwich on Nov. 6, 1974, were also reversed.
   Hill was arrested again and taken to Belfast in Northern
Ireland, where he had been convicted and sentenced to life in
prison for the murder of a former British soldier.
   New evidence ``throws such doubt upon the honesty and integrity
of a number of the Surrey officers investigating this case in 1974
that the Crown now feels unable to say that the convictions of any
of the four are safe or satisfactory,'' Roy Amlot of the Office of
Public Prosecutions told the hearing.
   The prosecution case was based entirely on confessions ``and in
particular on the integrity of the officers taking them,'' said
Amlot, who disclosed evidence that five officers had altered
documents, withheld evidence and ``seriously misled the court.''
   Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice, responded: ``In fact, they
must have lied.''
   Three of the five officers are still serving on the Surrey
department. Two were suspended Wednesday, said David Williams,
Surrey's deputy chief constable. Hurd said a third officer was
hospitalized, and the other two are retired.
   An independent assessor will recommend financial compensation
for the four, Hurd said.
   ``All the money in the world would not compensate for what my
son has gone through the last 15 years,'' said Eileen Armstrong,
who then burst into tears.
   Hurd said the judicial inquiry, to be headed by retired appeals
judge Sir John May, would also examine the conviction of the
``Maguire Seven,'' including Conlon's late father, on explosives
charges.
   That case developed from statements by Hill and Conlon that
Conlon's aunt, Annie Maguire, had manufactured bombs. She was
convicted of possession of explosives, as was her husband, Patrick,
their sons, Vincent and Patrick, and Patrick Conlon, Patrick
O'Neill and Sean Smyth. Conlon died in prison in 1980; the others
have served their sentences.
   While expressing satisfaction that ``the system has the capacity
to correct its own mistakes,'' Prime Minister Charles Haughey of
Ireland said he believed a similar error was made in the conviction
of six Irish men for two Birmingham pub bombings Nov. 21, 1974, in
which 21 people were killed and 160 wounded.
   The convictions were upheld last year.
   ``The official admission that a miscarriage of justice can
happen and does happen has major implications for other ... cases
and in particular the Birmingham six,'' said Paul May, chairman of
a group supporting the six convicts.
   ``We've still got a long, hard slog, but we can now see the end
of the road,'' said Breda Power, daughter of Billy Power, one of
the Birmingham convicts.
   Eight days after the Birmingham bombing, Parliament passed the
Prevention of Terrorism Act, allowing police to hold terrorism
suspects without charge for 48 hours and, in some cases, five more
days.
   Hill's conviction in the Guildford bombing was in one of the
Northern Ireland ``Diplock courts'' created in 1973, in which
judges decide terrorism cases without juries. A 1986 study found
that 89 percent of defendants in those courts pleaded guilty; of
those who pleaded innocent, 57 percent were convicted.
   Before Surrey police were accused of mishandling the Guildford
case, there were scandals of false confessions in the Kent and West
Midlands police forces. One officer was dismissed, two were
suspended and several were disciplined.

   More than a third of hunting injuries occur not
when one hunter shoots another but when careless, sleepy or even
drunk hunters _ or their guns _ fall out of trees, according to a
study released Thursday.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, which studies injuries
as well as disease in the United States, reported the results of a
Georgia study that found 36 percent of hunting injuries were
mishaps involving tree stands, perches where deer hunters wait in
concealment for their quarry.
   A tree stand can be anything from a hastily built platform to a
store-bought, built-for-comfort tree chair.
   The CDC and Georgia officials studied 594 deer-hunting-related
injuries in the state over a decade; 214, including 17 deaths,
involved tree stands. Fractures were common.
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Dr. Steven Gordon,
an epidemiologist with the Georgia Department of Human Resources.
``The nature of the system is such that the only reports we get are
the ones that are fairly serious.''
   The study looked just at Georgia, but ``we're sure this is
occurring in other states,'' Gordon said, adding that ``no one had
systematically looked into it.''
   ``Most people hear of hunting accidents, they picture one person
shooting another,'' said Joel Brown, Georgia's State Hunter Safety
Coordinator. But in recent years, he said, ``over 50 percent have
involved tree stands. It's a serious problem.''
   Most of the tree stand injuries involved falls; 111 hunters were
hurt when they tumbled out of their stands, 49 fell while trying to
climb down and 40 fell while trying to climb up. The average stand
was 16 feet above the ground, Gordon said.
   Some hunters simply lost their balance, but others had stranger
stories.
   One woman, Gordon said, was hurt in a mishap involving both the
tree she was hiding in and the deer she shot. The wounded deer
charged toward her and crashed into the tree, shaking it and
dislodging her from her stand. She broke a leg.
   Twenty-seven injuries _ and eight of the 17 tree stand
fatalities _ occurred when weapons went off accidentally, either
while being carried up and down the tree or on impact from a fall.
   Injuries were often serious; 156 hunters, or 73 percent,
suffered fractures. Sixteen teen-age hunters suffered neck
fractures and were paralyzed.
   Eleven hunters reported they had fallen asleep just before
falling out. Eight hunters either admitted they were drunk or were
suspected of it by game officials. And that number, Gordon said,
might be low.
   ``We could not assess the influence of alcohol or other
substance abuse. ... Most of these hunters did not have
blood-alcohol levels taken,'' he said.
   Some of the injured hunters were asked whether they had taken a
hunting safety course; two-thirds hadn't. And none of the 214
injured hunters were wearing safety harnesses or seat belts.
   Many mishaps could have been prevented, the CDC said, if hunters
had used safety harnesses, unloaded their guns while climbing up
and down, used pull-up cords to hoist their weapons into their
stands and checked the condition of their stands before climbing in.
   ``It's important that equipment be checked before you go up,''
Gordon said.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, the top U.S.
prosecutor, met with the head of the KGB and signed an agreement on
joint prosecution of Nazi war criminals to conclude a five-day trip
to Moscow, Tass said Thursday.
   The memorandum on Nazis signed by Thornburgh and Soviet
Prosecutor-General Alexander Sukharev formalized the existing
practice of cooperating on investigation of suspects and bringing
them to trial, Tass reported. Thornburgh said there are still about
10,000 Nazi war criminals worldwide.
   Thornburgh met with KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov, Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov and their fellow member of the 11-man ruling
Politburo, Alexander Yakovlev. He also spoke with Vice President
Anatoly Lukyanov, Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin and Supreme Court
Chairman E.A. Smolentsev.
   The visit, the first by a U.S. attorney general to the Soviet
Union, came at a time when the Soviet legislature is debating legal
guarantees of human rights, reform of the criminal justice system
and changes in the criminal code. Thornburgh discussed the American
experience in these areas with his Soviet hosts, Tass said.

   A chartered plane, a few helicopters and several hotels later,
options dealers from the Pacific Stock Exchange had a smooth day of
trading Thursday at makeshift posts in the Chicago, New York and
Philadelphia markets.
   ``What we pulled off ... was no mean feat,'' said exchange
spokesman Dale Carlson. ``I just shipped 140 guys away from their
families a day after the worst catastrophe in San Francisco
history.''
   If Tuesday's quake wasn't quite the worst catastrophe in the
city's history _ that distinction still belongs to the 1906
earthquake _ the trading airlift was indeed a mean feat. It was an
unprecedented logistical nightmare that involved carpenters,
electricians, computer experts and the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Officials at the various exchanges said trading went smoothly.
``There were no hitches,'' said Warren Moulds at the Chicago Board
Options Exchange. ``Once they got oriented, it was an easy do.''
   Stock trading continued Wednesday at the exchange in San
Francisco, a day after the earthquake knocked out power and
computers. Dealers worked by candle and flashlight, rerouting
trades via phone through Los Angeles.
   But the Los Angeles exchange doesn't trade options, so about 150
Pacific options traders and support staffers had to be moved east
so investors could continue trading stock options listed solely on
the Pacific exchange.
   The timing was critical because of the looming expiration of
October stock options. Friday is the deadline for investors to
renegotiate the options, which let them buy or sell specific stocks
at a specific price at a certain time.
   The exchange trades options in 130 stocks, with 70,000 contracts
changing hands on an average day. Among big-name stocks that have
options traded only on the Pacific exchange are Hilton Hotels Corp.
and Compaq Computer Corp.
   In San Francisco, building inspectors OK'd the trading floors
Thursday, but Carlson said options traders would remain where they
were through Friday.
   The marathon effort was sanctioned Wednesday by the SEC. At the
American and New York exchanges, carpenters and electricians worked
through the night on trading areas; at the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, computer experts laid extra cables and programmed
computers to accept new issues.
   The Pacific crews arrived by chartered jet shortly before dawn
Thursday in Chicago. The jet headed for Newark, N.J., where some
traders caught buses into New York and others caught helicopters
and limousines to Philadelphia.
   ``They haven't slept in 24 hours, plus the trauma of the
earthquake. Our hats are off to them,'' said Philadelphia exchange
President Nicholas Giordano. In Chicago, Pacific trading began at
the market's 8:30 a.m. CDT opening. In New York and Philadelphia,
extra time was needed for traders to arrive and get settled, and
trading didn't begin until 1 p.m. EDT.
   The exchanges ``opened up their doors like good Samaritans,''
said George Kender, executive vice president of the Chicago-based
Options Clearing Corp., which clears all trades in options. ``The
cooperation has been phenomenal.''

<HEAD>House, Senate Agree on $20,000 Payments for 60,000 Japanese-Americans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators endorsed on
Thursday legislation guaranteeing $20,000 compensation payments to
the estimated 60,000 living Japanese-Americans who were sent to
internment camps in World War II.
   The compromise legislation, which could pay the former internees
as much as $1.2 billion over three years, must now be be approved
by both houses of Congress before being sent to the White House for
consideration by President Bush.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has opposed the payments becuse
of their cost. Bush has not made his position known.
   The reparations payments are part of an overall $17.3 billion
measure providing appropriations for the Commerce, State and
Justice departments for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.
   House negotiators accepted the Senate-passed version of the bill
guaranteeing that all surviving internees will receive the payments.
   The Senate voted 74-22 on Sept. 29 to waive budget restrictions
and guarantee the reparations payments are made.
   The Senate version of the bill, which the conference approved,
bars any payments until the beginning of the fiscal 1991.
   But it then makes up to $500 million a year available over three
years until all of the $20,000 reparations payments are made.
   The payments would be free of federal tax.
   The House version of the bill would have appropriated $50
million to be made available immediately but included no guarantees
of any payments beyond that.
   Congress authorized the payments last year. Because of the
budget crunch, however, no money was actually paid out.

   Freddie Mac, a federally chartered mortgage
agency, on Thursday offered a moratorium on foreclosures for
homeowners whose properties were damaged by the San Francisco
earthquake.
   The agency, formally known as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp., will permit the moratorium on single-family home mortgages
until Jan. 1. Also, on a case-by-case basis, it will offer a
temporary suspension or reduction in mortgage payments.
   ``We felt it necessary to move quickly in providing immediate
relief. ... We are aware that many homeowners have inadequate or no
earthquake insurance on their properties,'' said Freddie Mac Vice
President Jo Ann Pierson.
   Homeowners should contact their lenders to determine whether
their mortgages were sold to the agency, which helps finance one in
eight of American homes, she said.
   Freddie Mac, which purchases mortgages from lenders, packages
them into securities and resells them to investors, is offering a
similar program to victims of Hurricane Hugo.

   Sony Classical is making plans to record pianist
Vladimir Horowitz this month and operas beginning next year and to
release home videos of concerts.
   The first opera to be recorded will be ``Aida'' next May, with
Metropolitan Opera personnel and conductor James Levine. The
following November, ``Salome'' will be recorded, with soprano Eva
Marton and Zubin Mehta conducting the Berlin Philharmonic. In
February 1991, two recordings will be made at La Scala, both
starring tenor Placido Domingo with Lorin Maazel conducting.
   ``If you want to be taken seriously as an important label, which
I feel is the task I have, you have to show you are looking out for
the best,'' said Gunther Breest, president since January of Sony
Classical, formerly the classical division of CBS Records.
   ``It's not a question you have to make the return of investment
within three years. With top artists we should be allowed to have a
long-lasting catalog buildup,'' Breest said.
   Breest said that CBS-signed artists including Isaac Stern, Yo-Yo
Ma, Midori and Murray Perahia will record for Sony Classical, and
European orchestras including the Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna
Philharmonic and Concertgebouw of Amsterdam. The only American
orchestra on the label will be the Boston Pops with conductor John
Williams.
   Breest moved to Sony Classical after 18 years with Deutsche
Grammophon, where he produced recordings made by conductor Herbert
von Karajan and became executive vice president. Sony Corp. owns
CBS Records.
   The president of Sony Corp., Norio Ohga, who lured Breest away
from Deutsche Grammophon, is a former opera baritone married to a
pianist.
   ``This gives me a good feeling of support that the top
management of Sony has an understanding for our dreams and
ambitions,'' Breest said.
   Sony Classical will have editing and mixing facilities in New
York and Hamburg, with mobile equipment to take where recordings
are done. There will be a recording studio in Berlin.
   Sony Classical will market home videos starting in late spring,
some already made, including some with von Karajan, and some new
ones including this year's New Year's concert in Vienna, Bruckner's
``Fourth Symphony'' with Sergiu Celibidache and the Munich
Philharmonic, Itzhak Perlman with Daniel Barenboim, a recital by
Perahia and ``Pictures at an Exhibition'' by Sir Georg Solti with
the Chicago Symphony.

<HEAD>Program Halts Ancient River Blindness Scourge in Much of Africa</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-year assault on tiny parasites has halted an
ancient scourge in much of Africa, sparing millions the threat of
blindness, program director Ebrahim Samba said Thursday.
   The Gambian physician, head of the Onchocerciasis Control
Program, told reporters: ``Of the 10 million people in danger when
we started, none is at risk. Not one.''
   Also, Samba said, thousands of miles of fertile riverbank land
have been put back into use by farmers who had fled because of the
disease.
   Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is among the more dreaded of
endemic diseases that afflict millions in the Third World but
remain little known in developed countries.
   Worldwide, ``oncho'' affects an estimated 80 million people in
Africa, tropical Latin America and parts of southern Arabia. It
causes vicious, relentless itching followed by blindness or death.
   Samba was in Paris for a World Bank meeting to brief donors on
the program.
   Operations began in 1974, administered by the World Health
Organization and supported by 20 donors. The program focused on the
worst-hit area, seven countries of the Volta River basin in West
Africa.
   A million people there suffered from oncho at the time, and
nearly 100,000 were blind. Since then, the program added four
neighboring countries.
   By 1991, it will have cost $300 million, with the biggest
contributions from the United States, the World Bank and the
Netherlands. A final monitoring phrase is planned until 1997.
   Samba estimated 90,000 people would have gone blind since 1974
and a million children would have been exposed without the program.
   ``Transmission has stopped for five years,'' he said. ``It is
under control.''
   Teams worked in villages inured to the daily routine of small
children leading around sightless elders. In parts of Burkina Faso,
one infant in five could expect to be blind by age 30.
   ``On a continent where the average annual income is $300, you
can imagine how serious it is to be blind,'' Samba said.
   Oncho is carried by microscopic larvae transmitted in the bite
of river-bred black flies. When operations started, farmers were
being bitten up to 1,000 times a day during the rainy season.
   In the human body, larvae grow into threadlike worms, lumped in
nodules that itch so badly they can drive victims to suicide. They
attack the eyes and a buildup of dead worms causes blindless.
   Eradication teams in small planes and helicopters ranged along
11,000 miles of rivers, spraying weekly during wet seasons. New
resistant strains emerged, forcing changes in larvacides.
   Borne by westerly winds, flies traveled 400 miles a day from
unsprayed areas. To stop reinfestation, the program was expanded
from 295,000 square miles to 502,000 square miles.
   Teams treat victims with a new drug, ivermectin, donated by
Merck &amp; Co. of Rahway, N.J., which controls young worms. Adult
worms defy all medicines, living up to 18 years.
   Ivermectin requires at least one dose yearly. It cannot prevent
infestation. But, Samba said, its use has sharply cut back
blindness and other debilitating effects.
   Samba has spent almost as much time at politics as disease
control across a wide region where conflicts sometimes erupt in
gunfire.
   After the brief war between Mali and Burkina Faso in 1985, his
were the first civil aircraft back in the air.
   ``Often Cabinet ministers have relatives, mothers and fathers,
who suffer from oncho,'' Samba said. ``They understand the urgency
on a personal level.''
   He acknowledged that program methods could not be easily applied
elsewhere in Africa or Latin America because the flies were
scattered over too wide an area.
   ``But elsewhere, this is not so acute a problem,'' he said.
   The program includes Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana,
Mali, Niger, Togo, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Sierra Leone.
   Florent Agueh, World Bank officer for the region, called the
program a model for aid to developing countries.
   ``After 15 years, enthusiasm among donors and recipients is as
strong as ever,'' he said. ``In the world of development,
persistence is usually what is most lacking.''

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Cardinal
Josef Glemp led 15,000 mourners Thursday at an anniversary Mass for
the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a popular priest slain by the secret
police five years ago.
   Many of the 259 Solidarity members of Parliament attended the
90-minute outdoor evening service at St. Stanislaw Kostka's Church,
Popieluszko's former parish in a residential neighborhood of
northern Warsaw.
   Dozens of buses that brought workers from around the country
lined the street in front of the church. Hundreds of candles
flickered on the sidewalks surrounding the grounds.
   Scores of banners proclaimed representatives of factories and
Solidarity chapters throughout Poland. One banner near the grave
said: ``Jerzy, today we collect the fruit of your suffering.''
   Popieluszko supported workers in the difficult years after the
declaration of martial law Dec. 13, 1981. Pro-Solidarity
demonstrations and clashes with security police have marked
previous anniversaries of his death.
   He became a symbol of Solidarity's struggle for recognition.
Foreign leaders, such as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain, visited his grave.
   Glemp, the Roman Catholic primate of Poland, said in his sermon:
``After five years, the nation remembers the brave chaplain and
will remember. Father Jerzy believed, and spread this belief, that
time would come for the victory of truth.''
   Glemp put Popieluszko in the pantheon of great Poles, such as
composer Frederic Chopin, who died in France 140 years ago this
week.
   The crowd warmly welcomed a delegation from Hungary, which, like
Poland, has set a course away from communism and toward democracy.
   ``We'd like to put into practice in our country, in Hungary,
what Father Popieluszko was teaching us,'' said a Hungarian priest
accompanying the group.
   He told the Poles an exhibition on Popieluszko opened in Hungary
this month, and asked for prayers for the Hungarian Roman Catholic
church.
   Walesa went to Popieluszko's grave for a silent prayer before
the Mass, but did not speak at the service.
   Political life in Poland has dramatically changed this year. Not
only has Solidarity been made legal again, but a former Solidarity
editor is prime minister of the first non-Communist government in
the Soviet bloc.
   State radio and television, now directed by a Solidarity member,
carried a range of programs about Popieluszko, including comments
by his mother and an interview with his former driver.
   Three secret policemen abducted the priest Oct. 19, 1984. Ten
days later, his bound and gagged body was pulled from the freezing
Vistula River.
   The three policeman and their commanding officer were convicted
of murder in February 1985.
   Testimony at the trial indicated Popieluszko was killed because
of his activities in defense of workers dismissed or jailed for
supporting Solidarity.
   One of the convicted policeman has been released under a reduced
sentence, but the others remain in prison.

   By train, by boat and by car, commuters
struggled to reach work Thursday following the deadly quake that
closed the vital bridge linking San Francisco to Oakland and the
rest of the East bay.
   A 50-foot section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
collapsed during Tuesday evening's quake, which measured 6.9 on the
Richter scale.
   Many commuters found themselves stuck in traffic jams. Others
arrived at buildings still in the dark or with only partial power.
Others turned back after facing up to four-hour delays on the
overburdened highways.
   ``People are just trying to get back to reality, to make life
like it was before,'' said Steve Tomberlin of Traffic Central, a
private traffic information service.
   Many city residents biked or walked to work, and at least one
businessman roller-skated down from Twin Peaks.
   Commuters from the south faced up to a four-hour delay, compared
to the average hour-long drive, according to Tomberlin. People
trying to reach work from Marin and Sonoma counties to the north
faced delays of up to 90 minutes.
   In the populous southern half of the San Francisco Bay area,
freeways jammed up in both directions from Hayward in the east to
Gilroy in the west. Traffic in the northern, less-populated part of
the nine-county region was lighter. But in some areas, particularly
for eastbound commuters heading from San Francisco and Marin County
to Alameda and Contra Costa counties, traffic was backed up for
several miles.
   In some highway stretches, several of them stretching for 10
miles, traffic was stop-and-go at maximum speeds of 5 mph.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system restored full operations for
the Wednesday morning commute, but spokesman Mike Healy said the
passenger load _ typically about 50,000 people each way on weekdays
_ was slightly below normal early in the commute. But trains were
standing-room only by mid-morning, hours past the traditional rush
hour.
   The San Francisco Municipal Railway, the city's bus, cable car
and trolley system, normally carries 800,000 passengers daily. The
system was 30 percent below normal, according to spokesman George
Newkirk.
   The passenger load on buses and ferries operated by the Golden
Gate Transit system from north of the city was about half normal,
officials said.
   About 3,000 commuters arrived in San Francisco by boat. The Red
&amp; White Fleet, Blue &amp; Gold Fleet and Hornblower Yacht Service
offered trips to the Berkeley and Oakland waterfronts, where
ferries don't normally stop.

   It was now you see it, now you don't for the female
form in Thursday's ready-to-wear fashion shows for next summer.
   Japanese designers and others swathed their models in loose,
smooth and sometimes transparent fabrics that suggested the body
without emphasizing it.
   After two seasons of ``normal'' clothes, Rei Kawakubo at Comme
des Garcons in particular reverted to some of her old layering and
asymmetrical tricks.
   Kawakubo's designs suggested a circus _ starting with a big
group of white blousons, bubble skirts and shorts _ with a hole
carved out of one jacket sleeve at the shoulder, a typical Kawakubo
signature touch.
   Some Comme des Garcons items looked like true Paris fashion;
others were a mess, including bunched-up prints clinging to the
body and hitched up to one side to look self-consciously offhand.
   Besides her usual black and white, Kawakubo went in for some
blinding neon shades of pink, green and yellow bright enough to
stop traffic on Sunset Boulevard.
   An off-white, long ``cool wool'' coat with little points at the
shoulders was quite handsome. Another original idea was pairing
fencers' tunics with wide cuffed shorts and long lean pants for a
smooth layered look.
   People with a figure problem might appreciate the wide-flowing
sheer cotton dresses printed in ``passementerie'' flowered bands or
plaids. And the black tent dresses edged in gold chains were
another good solution for the weight-watching set.
   For evening, she suggested women turn into disco decor _ in
black and white viscose gowns with square mirror toppings.
   Yohji Yamamoto's long satin vests and baggy pants in navy or
black-and-white combinations looked typical of the Japanese
creator. His sober layered looks command a big following though
they're no longer in the avant-garde.
   Yamamoto varied his usual menu of dreary black with lots of
welcome color, starting with a loose tangerine satin viscose apron
worn over a clinging black body suit. Transparent voile cottons
flowing over black underneath gave a lighter appeal to his severity.
   Yamamoto showed some wonderful stiffened dark gray mid-calf
skirts gathered like cartridge pleats with clinging black tops. But
just to emphasize female curves, he brought out dresses with
plumped-up bodices to puff up the bosom over skirts with padded
ridges.
   Another designer to hail the female bust was Jean-Charles de
Castelbajac. He brought out some molded latex flesh-colored tops
with every anatomical detail in place, topping them with a rainbow
of multi-colored sheer cotton duster jackets over wide long pants
in hot hues like orange, raspberry, yellow and emerald.
   The new fabrics in shorts, big jackets and long pants included
neutral tones of a corrugated and textured silk-like fabric.
Hand-painted gzar and canvas were always in the strong color and
simple themes Castelbajac loves, and red-navy-white combinations of
felt and linen came out in all versions of sailor styles.
   For beachcombers wanting to hide from the sun he showed some
full-skirted silvery linen outfits topped by floppy straw sunhats
as big as a beach umbrellla.
   After many years as a structural designer, showing clothes based
on menswear, Nino Cerruti loosened up considerably with a flowing
liquid silhouette for a casual but sophisticated woman.
   After some strict pastel suits for power dressing, he brought
out a big range of long and flowing outfits in soft neutral tones
of glen plaids, solids like dusty pink and gray-blue.
   His silhouette was always lean, under very long and rounded
lapels or wide and floppy lapels, the white blouse collars showing
on top.
   Thierry Mugler always exaggerates the female form, and this time
was no exception. Besides some hot wrapped-print sarong looks, he
molded bodies in plenty of outfits with a campy-sexy cartoon
appeal, and even decked out one model in the trappings of a loud
1950s hot-rod, with bumper-bullet bosoms, chrome trim and all.

<HEAD>Two Medellin Cartel Colombians Captured in Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican authorities have captured the nephews
of two major Colombian drug kingpins and broken up a ring that flew
cocaine into Mexico and shipped it by boat to Florida, authorities
said Thursday.
   The Colombians were captured along with eight other men Sunday
at a clandestine airstrip in the Yucatan Peninsula, according to
federal police commander Fausto Valverde, head of the narcotics
interdiction forces.
   Two other men were captured in the resort city of Cancun, but
one Colombian escaped in an airplane, Valverde said.
   The leaders of the Yucatan ring were Luis Alfredo Aguilar
Castro, a nephew of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, and Ricardo Isunza
Ochoa, a nephew of Fabio Ochoa, Valverde said.
   Fabio Ochoa and Rodriguez Gacha, known as ``El Mexicano''
because of his fondness for things Mexican, are top members of the
Medellin cartel and are among the world's most wanted drug
traffickers.
   Valverde said Aguilar and Isunza Ochoa were their uncles'
representatives in the smuggling operation. When asked if the two
might be extradited to the United States, Valverde said, ``Anything
is possible.''
   He said he didn't know what charges the two might be wanted on
in Colombia or in the United States, nor if a U.S.-Colombia
agreement under which drug traffickers can be extradited to the
United States would apply.
   Commander Miguel Rodriguez Lorrabaquio said the case was
unrelated to recent large drug busts along the U.S.-Mexico border,
including the seizure of nine tons of cocaine in Harlingen, Texas,
and 20 tons in a Los Angeles suburb.
   Lorrabaquio said the Yucatan ring brought cocaine in from
Colombia by air, then shipped it by boat to the United States,
usually to Florida, while the cocaine seized along the border was
probably being taken across by land.
   Valverde said the airplane carrying the drugs escaped when
someone on the ground warned the pilot by radio that Mexican police
were at the airstrip.
   He said authorities were looking into whether the drugrunners
had any official or unofficial protection for their ground
operations.
   ``We imagine they made an arrangement for protection,'' Valverde

   Valverde said that in spite of the situation in Colombia, where
drug-related violence has increased since the August assassination
of a presidential candidate, there had been no threats against
Mexican law enforcement officials over the seizure of Aguilar and
Isunza Ochoa.
   Valverde said U.S. and Colombian authorities had no involvement
in the three-month investigation and bust.

   A head-on collision before dawn Friday
between a tourist bus and a tractor-trailer in far northern New
South Wales left at least 22 people dead, police said.
   At least 22 other passengers on the bus were injured, many
seriously, in the 4 a.m. accident, which occurred on the Pacific
Highway a mile outside the town of Cowper, police said.
   The tourist coach, operated by Sunliner Coaches of Sydney, was
en route from Sydney to Brisbane when it collided with the
tractor-trailer, whose driver was instantly killed, police said.
   Rescue helicopters came from Brisbane and the Gold Coast to take
the most seriously injured to Brisbane, the closest large city with
facilities to treat the victims, authorities said.
   It was not immediately known whether any foreigners were on
board the bus.

<HEAD>Arguments Begin in Trial of Nurse Charged With Lethally Injecting
Patients</HEAD>

   An ex-nurse charged with killing four
hospital patients with lethal injections was a ``monster'' dressed
in white who switched from mice to humans for experiments, a
prosecutor said in opening arguments Thursday.
   Richard Angelo was ``the living embodiment of your worst
nightmare,'' Assistant District Attorney John Colins told the jury.
   ``He conducted uncontrolled experiments on knowingly terribly
vulnerable human beings for his stated purposes of improving his
image and reputation,'' Colins said.
   Police have said Angelo admitted he injected patients at a Long
Island hospital to put them on the brink of death so he could be
the first on the scene to resuscitate them and look like a hero to
his colleagues.
   Angelo, 27, was a nurse for about six months in 1987 at Good
Samaritan Hospital, when four patients, ranging in age from 57 to
75, died within minutes of being injected with the muscle relaxant
Pavulon. Three other patients survived Pavulon injections.
   The Lindenhurst man is charged with four counts of second-degree
murder and three counts of assault.
   Eric Naiburg, Angelo's attorney, conceded that Angelo injected
the patients with the drug and that some of those patients may have
died as a result of what he did. But he said Angelo is not guilty
of murder. He suggested a count of lesser homicide or assault.
   Colins charged that Angelo turned to humans after tiring of
performing drug experiments on mice.
   ``To unsuspecting patients in the special care unit at Good
Samaritan Hospital, (Angelo) was a monster dressed in nurse's
whites,'' Colins said. ``He was not content to stop after
experimenting first with his mice and watching them die.''
   One of those Angelo is charged with assaulting, Gerolamo Kucich,
75, testified that Angelo asked him how he was feeling and then
injected him with a paralyzing drug after saying, ``This will make
you feel much better.''
   ``I became like dead. ... I couldn't move,'' said Kucich, who
had been hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. ``I was
thinking, how long is it going to last before I die?''
   As Kucich testified, Angelo sat at the defense table with his
eyes downcast.
   Kucich said he pressed the emergency alarm and his regular
nurse, Lauren Ball, came in and helped revive him.
   Moments later, Angelo returned to the room, but Kucich said he
still couldn't talk or see. He said he heard Angelo's voice and
pointed toward the voice.
   According to Kucich, Mrs. Ball asked Angelo, ``What did you do?''
   Kucich said Angelo answered, ``Nothing,'' and left the room.

<HEAD>Execution Delayed Again for Louisiana's Longest Death Row Resident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANGOLA, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday stayed the execution
of Louisiana's longest death-row resident less than 12 hours before
he was to go to the electric chair for killing a state trooper in
1977.
   U.S. District Judge Donald E. Walter granted Dalton Prejean, 30,
the stay shortly after receiving Prejean's latest appeal, saying
the early Friday deadline gave him too little time to review it.
   Louisiana State Penitentiary officials had been preparing the
electric chair for use just after midnight.
   Prejean was in another section of the prison at a state Pardon
Board hearing, where friends and family pleaded for clemency. But
the hearing was suspended after Walter's ruling.
   On Wednesday, the state Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal
by Prejean, who was 17 when he shot trooper Donald Cleveland to
death after the officer stopped the car Prejean and his brother
were in.
   The murder occurred only six months after Prejean's release from
a reform school, where he'd been sent for killing a taxi driver
when he was 14.
   Prejean has been on death row 10 years, longer than any other
Louisiana convict. Eight previous execution dates were canceled by
state or federal courts.
   In his latest appeal, Prejean's attorneys claim the prosecution
systematically excluded blacks from the jury.
   No new date was set for the Pardon Board hearing. The board can
recommend a more lenient sentence for a convicted killer. The
recommendation must be acted on by the governor.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem spent 45
minutes Thursday with two terrorists he had pardoned, who told
reporters the return of democracy had removed the need for the
anti-government violence they advocated in the 1970s.
   Fernando Vaca Narvaja and Roberto Perdia, who until 12 days ago
were fugitives in hiding outside the country, told a Government
House news conference they had thanked Menem for the pardon and
pledged to work for national reconciliation.
   ``There is no possibility ... of armed action when democratic
institutions are in full force,'' said Vaca Narvaja, who promised
to return ransom money his Montonero guerrillas extorted from
kidnap victims.
   Norvaja, now 41 and in a jacket and tie, looked more like a
middle-class professional than someone once accused of murder,
kidnapping, assault, bombings, jailbreak, airplane hijacking and
other crimes.
   Perdia, paunchy and pinstriped at 48, looked equally unlike a
revolutionary whose actions helped bring on the military coup of
March 1976 and the ``dirty war'' against suspected leftists that
raged until the end of the decade.
   ``It is absolutely essential to think of and construct a future
for the living, without forgetting the past,'' he said.
   On Oct. 7, Menem pardoned 39 colonels, generals and vice
admirals who faced trial for kidnapping, torture and murder in the
disappearances and presumed deaths of 9,000 people during nearly
eight years of military rule. The junta left power upon the
election of lawyer Raul Alfonsin as president in 1983.
   Menem, a former provincial governor who succeeded Alfonsin in
July, also pardoned 64 guerrillas and indicated he soon would free
Jorge Videla and Roberto Viola, army generals who served as
presidents of the military juntas and are in prison for human
rights violations.
   Also on the potential pardon list is Mario Firmenich, co-founder
of the Montoneros, who is serving a 30-year sentence for murder.
   Menem's goal is to end a bloody chapter in Argentine history and
concentrate on dealing with Argentina's chronic inflation, a
protracted recession and uncharacteristically high unemployment.
   The military has insisted since relinquishing power to Alfonsin
in December 1983 that it fought a kind of civil war against
terrorists. Rights groups accuse the military of wholesale killing.
   Rights groups and leftist political organizations opposed the
military pardons and say they hope to gather a million signatures
on a petition for reversal. Opponents also called a demonstration
for Friday outside the faded pink Government House.
   Meanwhile two of the three largest political parties have
endorsed the pardon, as has the Roman Catholic Church, the largest
newspapers and the most influential business and farm groups.

   Pro-democracy activists said on Thursday that the
choice of Egon Krenz as East Germany's new leader could lead to
protesters again filling the streets unless he belies his hard-line
reputation and implements reforms.
   Krenz succeeded Erich Honecker on Wednesday and soon made clear
in an address to the nation the communist party will resist the
democratic trends evident in East Germany's Warsaw Pact allies
Hungary and Poland.
   But he said West Germany's refusal to recognize East German
citizenship was an obstacle to expanding travel to the West.
   Krenz on Thursday visited an East Berlin factory and his
encounter with workers, which touched on broad public
dissatisfaction, was deemed by West Germany's ARD TV network
``unthinkable only a few weeks ago.''
   Excerpts of the footage shown on Aktuelle Kamera, East Germany's
main evening newscast, were carried by West German networks.
   When asked by Krenz why so many co-workers had fled to West
Germany, metal worker Ronald Berus said: ``A lot of things kept
adding up until some people felt there was just no alternative.''
   Several workers complained of the rigid travel restrictions,
which recently were expanded to include Czechoslovakia, Poland and
Hungary after more than 53,000 East German refugeess streamed there
to begin their treks West.
   The unusual presentation may reflect a willingness by Krenz to
allow more frank discussion of national problems in the
state-controlled media.
   Krenz also met with Werner Leich, head of the East German
Lutheran Church Federation, for talks described by East German TV
as ``open and constructive.''
   Krenz said Wednesday he wanted to improve relations between
church and state.
   Also Thursday, the West German newspaper Bild said Poland's
state bank is selling for hard currency 100 million East German
marks it holds in banks in Frankfurt. Bild said the bank acted
because of ``a lack of confidence in (East Germany's) internal
stability'' and as a hedge against a possible revaluation of East
Germany's currency.
   East Germany officially pegs one East German mark equal to one
West German mark. In reality, it is worth perhaps a fourth of that.
A dollar now fetches about 1.85 West German marks.
   Reinhard Schult, a founder of New Forum, the largest
pro-democracy group in East Germany, said Thursday on RIAS radio of
West Berlin, ``Krenz stands for the continuation of neo-Stalinst
politics.''
   He said Krenz ``did not have one word to say about the causes of
the current crisis and made no offer for talks with the
opposition.''
   Author Rolf Schneider, a critic of the government, told RIAS:
``The crisis will keep dragging on.''
   A Lutheran church leader said privately, ``The demonstrations
will start again soon'' unless the government changes its course.
The church has been in the forefront of reform efforts.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany urged
Krenz to make ``fundamental reforms.'' He said East Germans demand
``their basic rights.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a champion of reform,
sent Krenz a telegram expressing confidence he would ``respond to
the demands of the time, following a course of renewal and
continuity.''
   In Poland, the only Soviet bloc nation with a non-communist
government, both pro-Solidarity and communist party newspapers
described Honecker's departure as a welcome change.
   Newspapers in Hungary, which is moving rapidly from communism
toward Western-style democracy, said Krenz was seen as a
``transitional figure.''
   Reform activists in East Germany said 1,000 people peacefully
protested in Greifswald hours after Krenz, 52, a protege of
Honecker, was named leader.
   More than 120,000 pro-democracy protesters marched in Leipzig on
Monday.
   On Thursday, many residents of East Berlin were skeptical about
the leadership change.
   ``Krenz just wants to calm us down,'' said a worker in his
mid-20s. ``We'll have to see if there's going to be anything more
than words this time.''

with the newly widowed Jacqueline Kennedy at his side.
   There was also one picture on the wall at the exhibit in Union
Station that was close to home for Bush: a picture of the
president, Barbara Bush and assorted children and grandchildren in
bed at Kennebunkport.
   That picture was shot by White House photographer David Valdez,
who joined dozens of his colleagues at the crowded reception
attended by the president.
   The exhibit, ``Witness to History: 150 Years of
Photojournalism,'' was sponsored by the Eastman Kodak Co., and all
the pictures in the exhibit appear in a special Oct. 23 issue of
Time Magazine.
   Among the photographers crowding around Bush were Cecil
Stoughton, who took the Johnson oath of office picture; David Hume
Kennerly, who was Gerald Ford's White House photographer, and
Michael A.W. Evans, Ronald Reagan's photographer.

   Another destructive earthquake has motivated
Southern Californians once again to plan ahead for the next one,
but the rush for survival goods that accompanies such frightening
episodes may be short lived.
   ``Every time something like this happens we get a surge, then it
tapers off again,'' said Steve Reed of the 11-store Sportmart
chain, one of the region's largest sporting goods retailers.
   It's been two years since the quake in the Los Angeles suburb of
Whittier, which killed eight people, inspired residents to a
concerted effort to prepare for a natural calamity.
   Since the 6.9-magnitude San Francisco Bay Area quake Tuesday
night, the Sportmart stores have been overrun with customers buying
water purifiers, portable toilets, stoves, lanterns, flashlights
and food.
   ``This time, more than ever before, they are filling in with the
real nitty-gritty stuff,'' said Reed. The television coverage of
San Francisco earthquake victims deprived of such basics as food
and water has had a big impact, he said.
   ``Some of the items are selling tenfold, especially water
purifying kits. Water is the biggest concern. The idea has been
planted,'' said Reed.
   Experience has taught, however, that apathy will return.
   There was a mild response when the Sparkletts Drinking Water
Corp. tried selling earthquake preparedness kits earlier this year.
But the Bay Area quake jolted people into action, said Norm
Hefinton of the Sparkletts Santa Ana office.
   ``We expect to do about 40 percent more business. We get a surge
of business after every big earthquake,'' said Hefington.
   Consumers won't store items necessary for surviving an
earthquake unless they are shaken up, he said.
   Although Sparkletts ended its earthquake kit advertising
campaign in July, telephones orders began pouring in the day after
the Bay area quake. The kit includes two cases of bottled water, a
safety stove and a candle.
   Other quake preparedness items in demand were water heater
straps and wrenches to shut down gas and water lines, said Mike
Ainsworth of the Home Depot home improvement store in Huntington
Beach.

   Three strong aftershocks rattled a jittery
Northern California on Thursday, and rescuers who found fewer cars
than feared under a collapsed freeway said the World Series may
have reduced the rush-hour traffic.
   ``Maybe we got lucky because of the game,'' Oakland police Sgt.
Bob Crawford said. ``Normally at 5 o'clock in the afternoon this
area would be bumper-to-bumper. Maybe the World Series saved our
lives.'
   Power and commuters returned to much of downtown San Francisco
as a tentative city tried to recover and regroup following
Tuesday's earthquake, which claimed scores of lives and at least
$2.87 billion in damage.
   Residents of the ravaged Marina district, furious at initially
being barred from their homes, later lined up for 15-minute passes
to fetch clothing, medicine, food and belongings.
   At the 1\-mile stretch of the collapsed double-deck Interstate
880, the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, workers cut holes in concrete
and used cranes to pull out pancake-flat cars. Rescuers reported
finding the cars as far apart as 60 feet, rather than
bumper-to-bumper as had been feared, Assistant Fire Chief Al
Sigwart said.
   That could lower the death toll in the highway rubble _
estimated earlier at 253, authorities said.
   ``They are going lower, much lower in fact,'' Lisa Covington, a
spokeswoman for the Office of Emergency Services, said of the
estimates. ``What's happening is that they are finding fewer
vehicles under the bridge than they thought.''
   Firefighter Dan Getreu said he had walked the length of the
fallen highway and estimated no more than two dozen cars were
trapped.
   No new official estimate of fatalities was made.
   Many people left work early to watch the third game of the World
Series, scheduled to start at 5:30 p.m., and 60,000 people already
were across the bay in San Francisco at Candlestick Park when the
quake struck at 5:04 p.m.
   The World Series will resume Tuesday at Candlestick Park in San
Francisco.
   Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson said Thursday that only 85 people
were officially reported missing.
   On Thursday morning, three aftershocks struck south of San
Francisco. The first, measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale of ground
motion, hit at 3:15 a.m. and was centered near Watsonville, about
eight miles from the epicenter of Tuesday's 6.9 quake, according to
the state Office of Emergency Services. Two other aftershocks
measured 4.5.
   ``No one is really sleeping around here,'' Watsonville resident
John Murphy said.
   ``I can't stop shaking,'' said 73-year-old Marcelina Toussaint.
``I guess I'm surviving, but I'm scared.''
   Fifty-six people were treated at a Watsonville community clinic,
mostly for bruises and frazzled nerves, city spokeswoman Lorraine
Washington said. About 150 people were evacuated from a National
Guard Armory shelter after a natural gas leak.
   Watsonville issued a plea for additional doctors and nurses.
   Some homes that were damaged in the initial quake collapsed
under the power of the aftershocks. Many residents of the town of
30,000, part of California's ``salad bowl'' region where much of
the nation's lettuce, asparagus and artichokes are grown, spread
across lawns and vacant lots like refugees.
   ``We're talking about people with no resources, no money for
food and no money for health care,'' said Barbara Garcia, executive
director of Salud Pera La Gente, a state-financed community clinic.
   As of early Thursday, more than 1,400 aftershocks had been
recorded. The strongest, 5.2 on the Richter scale, struck within 40
minutes of the initial jolt, according the U.S. Geological Survey.
   Across the Bay area, the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan
area with more than 6 million people, shaken cities tried to cope
as best they could with still-limited services, strapped police and
fire departments and transportation havoc created by the closing of
freeways and the Bay Bridge, the lifeline that links Oakland and
San Francisco.
   A transportation department spokesman said a large marine barge
crane was being moved into place to lift the fallen upper deck slab
of the bridge, which might be reopened in three weeks.
   Frustration and despair were evident on city streets.
   Dan Lai sat on a curb in the ravaged Marina district with his
head in his hands, crying.

   Behind him was the four-story collapsed apartment building in
which two people died Tuesday night. They were Lai's friends, and
he had learned of their deaths only Thursday.
   ``I'm so upset. I came here, and it was all gone,'' Lai said.
   Throughout the district, sirens wailed, portable generators
hummed and heavy equipment, brought in to finish the destruction
the earthquake left unfinished, groaned.
   Marina residentsgathered at police barricades and begged for
permission to retrieve food, clothing and medicine from their
homes, but were denied because officials said the area was unsafe.
   ``This is a nightmare. I have to get my medicine for my asthma
and for my stomach,'' said Barbara Jones, 54.
   Lawyer Jim Braden said he had been going to work in his black
surfing T-shirt, gray sweat pants and brown dress shoes _ the only
clothes he had.
   ``This is ridiculous. It's a free nation. We should be allowed
to go back into our own homes,'' Braden said.
   The residents also scowled at a stream of tourists, armed with
video cameras, who paraded past the barricades.
   Some schools and most bank branches reopened, and some shelters
closed. The subway system was operating fully, but transit
spokesman Mike Healy reported below-normal passenger loads because
many workers remained home.
   Before dawn Thursday, thousands of alarms set off across the
Financial District heralded the restoration of power to downtown
buildings.
   For the most part, community spirit held up, even as the reality
of the devastation and hardship set in, and the grim tasks of
uncovering bodies and cataloging damage continued.
   A non-profit organization that provides food to AIDS victims
delivered more than 7,000 hot meals and sandwiches to shelters on
both sides of the bay.
   Pizzeria owner Pete Pallari mounted a charcoal grill in the bed
of a pickup and served meals _ scrambled eggs, bacon and fresh
coffee.
   ``I just couldn't save it. It would have all been spoiled,'' he
said.
   Volunteers continued toiling at the Nimitz Freeway disaster
scene in Oakland, preparing to stabilize the wreckage to eventually
retrieve battered bodies.
   Rescue workers placed wood and iron pipe supports beneath
tottering slabs of highway so they could work underneath the
blood-spattered concrete.
   ``You try to ignore it and just do your job,'' said construction
worker Brad Elfring.
   Part of the slow digging process includes crawling into the
wreckage to map the locations of the smashed cars, Oakland police
Sgt. Alan White said. Bright green, orange and pink paint marked
the spots of cars and bodies.
   Once the map is complete and the span is supported, which could
take several more days, White said, a machine called a concrete
nibbler will break through the upper level to each car, removing
sections of highway like pieces of cookie dough.
   At least one rescue worker, 20-year-old Jason Solorio, said he
believed there still may be survivors in the rubble. Solorio said
he sneaked into a section of the sealed-off freeway.
   ``There are open spaces in there where a person could be trapped
alive,'' he said.
   Gov. George Deukmejian demanded an investigation into the
collapse of I-880, saying it should have been built to survive the
earthquake.
   Despite the freeway disaster, California officials took note of
the success of earthquake preparedness and building codes. Although
the quake, at magnitude 6.9, was as strong as last year's Armenian
earthquake, the destruction was not even remotely comparable.
   The Armenian quake killed 25,000 people.
   President Bush said he would fly to California on Friday ``to
take a look and to provide encouragement to people.''
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said 1,173 California
National Guardsmen have been called to duty to help in quake
recovery operations.
   Williams said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began inspecting
federal dams and levees and, at the request of the state
government, state and private dams. So far, no damage has been
reported for structures inspected within 50 miles of the epicenter.
   A U-2 reconnaisance plane from Beale Air Force Base flew over
the San Francisco area to shoot pictures to detect problems in
structures.

<HEAD>Former Sandinista Commander Zero to Return to Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eden Pastora, a commander in the
Sandinista revolution who later defected to lead a rebel group,
said Thursday he will return to Nicaragua in six weeks.
   Pastora and Nicaraguan opposition presidential candidate Erick
Ramirez held a news conference to sign a pact ``to fight against
the Somozistas who remain in Nicaragua and against the new
Sandinista dictatorship.''
   Ramirez is the candiate of the Social Christian Party.
   Pastora said he would return Dec. 3, a day before the official
start of the campaign for Feb. 25, 1990, general elections.
   The main candidates are Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, an
opposition newspaper publisher from the 14-party United National
Opposition coalition, and President Daniel Ortega, who is running
for re-election.
   The Yatama organization of Indians and other Atlantic coast
minority groups and the small Popular Social Christian Party have
said they will support Ramirez.
   Pastora gained fame for leading an assault on the National
Palace on Aug. 22, 1978, during the Sandinista revolution. The
revolution overthrew President Anastasio Somoza on July 19, 1979,
ending the 42-year Somoza family dynasty.
   After breaking with the Sandinistas in 1982, Pastora formed the
Revolutionary Democratic Alliance, which fought from Nicaragua's
southern border until 1986.
   Five other former Contra leaders have returned to Nicaragua in
recent weeks.

   Up to 4.5 million Poles will get the East
bloc's first food stamps to battle inflation that has increased
food prices by more than 1,000 percent in three months, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
   The food coupons represent one of several steps the East bloc's
only non-communist government is taking to combat the worst effects
of the current economic crisis as Poland tries to switch to a
market-oriented economy from a deficit-ridden centralized system.
   Inflation is estimated at 600 percent or more annually. The
effects have been particularly acute for food since the Aug. 1
lifting of controls that had used government subsidies to keep
prices artificially low while creating an ever-widening budget
deficit.
   Meat prices have increased sevenfold, with 2.2 pounds of pork
costing $7.15. Butter has gone up from 14 cents for 1.1 pounds to
$1.80 for the same amount.
   Food coupons were a part of the new government's economic reform
plan announced Oct. 6, but details have not been presented.
   The food coupons will be available to pensioners and retirees,
the disabled and others who are getting help from social welfare
institutions, and children up to 6 years old from the poorest
families, according to the pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza.
   The recipients will be able to use coupons to pay for limited
amounts of milk, cheese and bread. The coupons will also be
redeemed at kindergartens, institution canteens and some other
public facilities, the report said.
   The first of the coupons will be distributed in December by
social agencies and local administrations to those who show
evidence of their low income, the newspaper said.
   ``The distribution of the coupons will become a lesson of a kind
of social trust. This `second money' will be given on the basis of
one's own statement about one's income,'' Gazeta Wyborcza said.
   About 4 million to 4.5 million people will meet the income limit
that will be set Dec. 1, likely pegged to the lowest current
pension, the report said.
   The food stamp program will be financed by withdrawing
government subsidies from the production of lowfat milk, cheese and
bread, the newspaper said. No figure was provided for the total
cost.
   Across Poland, soup kitchens have been opened by churches and
charitable organizations to help those hardest hit by the effects
of what Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has called ``economic
catastrophe.''
   The government faces a budget deficit of $2.3 billion that could
reach $4.4 billion by the end of the year without radical
cost-cutting steps.
   A substantial portion of the deficit came from subsidies that
were used to make up the widening gap between prices and the actual
cost of production. Prices for many non-food items still are
government-controlled, with controls to be lifted as part of the
switch to a market economy.
   Unlike food stamps, subsidies supply cheap food to all,
regardless of income, as did meat rationing, which assured modest,
inexpensive supplies even to those who could afford to pay more on
the free market.
   A rationing system continues in the Soviet Union to distribute
scarce goods, but at the same fixed state prices. A special package
of items is made available to pensioners, for example, but it is
not free or reduced in price.
   Food prices were raised gradually over the years in Poland, but
the communist government tried other economic reforms in lieu of
making major increases. It feared social unrest if the state
replaced government subsidies for production.
   However, the last act of the government of Mieczyslaw Rakowski,
now communist party first secretary, was to lift government
controls on food prices altogether Aug. 1 and end meat rationing.
   The new government agreed the step was needed but said it lacked
precautions to protect the poor from the worst effects.

   Trees in autumnal technicolor of crimson and gold turned
suddenly white Thursday when a storm blitzed the Midwest with up to
6 inches of snow, causing power outages to more than 200,000
customers in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan.
   It was the earliest snowfall on record for many cities,
including Cincinnati, Dayton, Ohio, Indianapolis and St. Louis.
   Snow also fell in portions of Kentucky, where a firefighter was
electrocuted by power lines downed by the snow.
   At least one other death, in Ohio, was attributed to the storm.
   In many places, the snow followed unusually balmy weekend
weather in the upper 70s and low 80s.
   ``I can't believe this,'' said Jan Fredbeck of Franklin, Ind.,
where 6 inches of snow fell. ``We've got Halloween decorations up
inside and they look so stupid now.''
   Some 100,000 Cincinnati-area customers had power knocked out as
the wet, heavy snow piled up on leaf-laden trees, causing them to
break and fall on power lines. Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Co.
spokesman Bruce Stoecklin said he expected service to be restored
by Thursday night.
   About 20,000 Ohio Edison customers in the Akron-area were
affected by outages but most had service restored by evening.
Electricity was knocked out to more than 20,000 customers in the
Dayton area, but was restored to all but about 16,000 by evening,
said Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. spokesman Allen Hill.
   Toledo Edison Co. spokesman Jim Proctor said 19,000 customers
lost electricity, but only 3,500 remained without power by Thursday
night.
   Schools were closed in much of the state as 3 to 5 inches of
snow fell in southwestern Ohio and 1 to 3 inches of snow was
reported elsewhere in the state.
   A Covington, Ohio, man was killed when his car veered into the
opposite lane of a snow-slickened state highway and struck a pickup
truck near Dayton, said Patty Carey of the Ohio Highway Patrol. The
area had received 4 inches of snow.
   John Robinson, a National Weather Service forecaster, said
records dating back to about 1870 show no snowfall in Cincinnati as
early as Oct. 19. It was also an earliest snowfall record for
Dayton.
   The snow that fell in most of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and parts
of southern Michigan, eastern Missouri and Kentucky was caused by a
Canadian cold front that met up with a storm system over the
Carolinas, said Dennis Dixon of the National Weather Service in Ann
Arbor, Mich.
   In Kentucky, up to 4 inches of snow fell, knocking out power to
up to 100,000 customers stretched from Louisville to the state's
northcentral and northeastern sections.
   An assistant fire chief in Burlington, Ky., Donnie L.
Kirkpatrick, 42, was electrocuted by felled power lines weighed
down by snow at a house where a fire was reported, said Clinton
Shields, deputy coroner in Boone County.
   In Detroit, the 2.7 inches of snow that had fallen by early
evening didn't set a record for early snowfall, but it did set one
for the heaviest for the month of October. The previous record had
been 1.4 inches on Oct. 19, 1930, said Bill Deedler, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Detroit.
   Detroit Edison Co. spokesman Martin Bufalini said 41,500
customers were without power.
   A Consumers Power Co. spokesman blamed high winds and snow for
knocking out power to 16,000 customers in Kalamazoo, Lansing and
Jackson in southern Michigan.
   Indiana power customers suffered outages as well. Public Service
Indiana, the state's largest utility, reported electricity was
knocked out to 6,000 customers, but service was restored to most of
the homes and businesses later Thursday, said Pam Chapman, a
spokeswoman for the Plainfield-based company that serves the
state's southern and central portions.
   About 3,000 customers of Indiana &amp; Michigan Electric Co.,
serving the northeastern part of the state, and Indianapolis Power
&amp; Light Co. lost power, but service was restored to most, spokesmen
said.
   A snow advisory was in effect for all of Indiana until Friday.
Up to 6 inches of snow had already accumulated over north-central,
central and east-central Indiana, making it in one day the snowiest
October on record.
   Indianapolis' snowfall of up to 6 inches was the deepest on
record since the weather service began keeping records in 1885,
said meteorologist John Curran of the National Weather Service. It
also broke a record for the earliest measurable snow, set Oct. 20,
1916.
   Light snowfall was reported in the afternoon in the central
Illinois cities of Peoria and Springfield, with sleet in Chicago,
the National Weather Service reported. Winds were gusting to 40 mph
and temperatures were in the low to mid 30s. Up to 4 inches'
accumulation was forecast for parts of Illinois.
   Snow flurries in the eastern half of Missouri on Friday gave St.
Louis its earliest snowfall on record. Like Indianapolis, it broke
a record set Oct. 20, 1916.

<HEAD>Drug Czar Admits Drugs Problem In Nation's Capital Worsening</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   National Drug Policy Coordinator William J.
Bennett said on Thursday that the drug crisis in the District of
Columbia continues to worsen despite a six-month joint partnership
by federal and local authorities fighting the problem.
   ``No one should be surprised to learn that the nation's capital
is still plagued by a serious drug problem,'' Bennett said at a
news conference. ``We picked a difficult task last April, and I
never had any illusions about the challenges that lay before us.''
   Bennett made his remarks while issuing a six-month ``progress
report'' on a special initiative he generated to help the district
curb its record murder rate and drug-related crime wave.
   So far in 1989, 360 persons have been killed in the district, 12
short of the all-time annual record that was set last year. By this
time in 1988, 270 homicides had been reported in Washington. Police
blame drugs, particularly crack cocaine, for more than 60 percent
of these deaths.
   On Wednesday, city officials complained that Bennett's
contributions have done little to stop the killings and said he has
taken credit for a variety of other anti-drug programs and
initiatives already in effect.
   ``Where we need help, they have not responded,'' said Frank
Jasmine, an assistant to City Administrator Carol B. Thompson.
``There's a long road to go.''
   Bennett defended the federal government's efforts, but said he
knew that local and federal authorities are in for a long battle.
   ``I wouldn't say that (we) haven't made any difference, but I
would still say the situation is intolerable,'' Bennett said. ``We
are in the process of getting control of the situation...but it
will take time.''
   Bennett, who criticized the city government for its handling of
the drug crisis shortly after he took office, said on Thursday that
his office is working better with district officials now.

   China threatened to cut economic ties with
Norway if the government or king attends the ceremony awarding the
Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama, Norwegian TV said, but Norway
showed no sign of give Thursday.
   Egil Aarvik, head of the awarding committee, dismissed the
threat while assessing China's reaction as the strongest by any
government since Adolf Hitler's fury when an anti-Nazi won the
award 53 years ago.
   ``Hitler reacted with a similar rage when Carl von Ossietzky won
the prize for 1935,'' Aarvik told The Associated Press on Thursday.
   Ossietzky, a German journalist, peace activist and opponent of
Hitler, was in a Nazi concentration camp when the award was made in
1936. Hitler responded by saying no German would be allowed to
accept the prize.
   The Dalai Lama, exiled Buddhist leader of Tibet, was named the
peace laureate Oct. 5 for his non-violent struggle to end Chinese
rule of his homeland. The announcement was widely seen as an
implied rebuke to Beijing for its crackdown on pro-democracy
protesters in June.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Sigrid Romundset said the Chinese
have not officially threatened a boycott. The ceremony will be held
on Dec. 10.
   Guisheng Wang, of the Chinese embassy in Oslo, refused to
comment on the threat reported on Wednesday by Norwegian
television. ``It is well known that we protested earlier,'' he said.
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry complained on Oct. 7 that the award
supported the Dalai Lama's efforts to split China and hurt the
feelings of the Chinese people.
   Foreign Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik observed, ``There are
established practices about participating in the awards ceremony
and we have no plans of changing them.''

   Engineers delayed strengthening the
32-year-old Oakland freeway that collapsed in this week's
earthquake because they believed it would survive a major quake,
the state transportation chief said Thursday.
   ``We didn't know 10 years ago this was subject to this type of
earthquake damage. We did not know there was any possibility it
would collapse,'' Transportation Director Robert Best said.
   Best said he was unaware of a private engineer's report in 1975
that the collapsed Interstate 880 viaduct had an outdated design
that made it vulnerable to such quakes.
   ``I've been assured there were no experts, no studies, no data
that suggested in any way that it would fall,'' Best said.
   State inspection reports for the collapsed section show a
history of minor problems over the years, including hair-line
cracks, flaking concrete, a cracked girder and sagging deck. Some
problems were corrected and others weren't.
   ``(But) there was no problem of structural failure at all,''
Best said of the reports.
   A 1\-mile-long stretch of the two-tiered Nimitz Freeway
collapsed during Tuesday's earthquake. An upper section of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge also collapsed.
   Gov. George Deukmejian has called for an immediate investigation
of I-880's collapse. The governor said the freeway should have been
built to survive the quake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale of ground motion.
   A blue-ribbon commission of bridge engineers is being set up to
determine why the structure collapsed and what steps can be taken
to prevent such tragedies in the future, Best said.
   J. David Rogers, a Pleasant Hill engineer, said he determined in
1975 that the structure wouldn't survive a major earthquake. And he
said the information was presented to state transportation
officials at that time.
   Best said it's ``irresponsible'' to suggest the state knew the
structure would collapse. He said it's possible there were
``unusual subsurface conditions that we didn't know about'' which
could have contributed to the collapse. The highway was built on
fill soils.
   The failed structure had undergone only the first phase of a
three-step program to reinforce the roadway, Best said. Engineers
felt I-880 would be at less risk than other highways because ``it
was the least likely to fail.''
   The retrofitting project on I-880 began in 1977 and was the
first road improvement since the highway was designed in 1954 and
constructed in 1957.
   But phase two of the program for I-880 and other roadways with
double-column supports was deferred as officials focused on
strengthening roads with single-column supports, which they
believed were more vulnerable, Best said.
   The first phase involved strengthening the roadway; the second
began on single-column supports two years ago and involves
strengthening existing columns.
   Authorities deferred the I-880 retrofitting pending outcome of a
still-unfinished engineering study to determine the best sort of
repairs. The freeway was last inspected in April.
   Officials had no estimate of when that study might be completed.
They emphasized that I-880 was not neglected or given too low a
priority in the retrofitting project.
   Asked whether the I-880 section had been considered safe from
earthquake damage, Transportation Department chief engineer Bill
Schaefer said, ``There's no such thing as an earthquake-proof
structure, certainly.'' But he added he was ``shocked'' by the
section's collapse.
   ``We thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake
we could have in this area, anything that would happen in this
area,'' he said.

   Some NBC affiliates complained that NBC News
didn't quickly air coverage of the San Francisco earthquake, but
were understanding when the delay was explained, an NBC official
said Thursday.
   The complaints, whose number wasn't tallied, were made to NBC
Television Network President Pier Mapes, NBC News executive news
director Don Browne, and NBC News President Michael Gartner, said
Peggy Hubble, an NBC News spokeswoman.
   NBC was the last of the networks to report Tuesday's earthquake
and to broadcast pictures from the scene. Once it began full
coverage after 9 p.m. EDT that day, NBC stayed on the air with
non-stop coverage that included a five-hour ``Today'' edition
before it signed off at noon Wednesday.
   In an interview Wednesday, Gartner blamed NBC's delay on the
quake itself. He said KRON-TV, NBC's San Francisco affiliate, had
been knocked off the air by the earthquake and was temporarily
unable to help NBC transmit its reports.
   ``We heard from a good number of affiliates, and I would say
they were as unhappy as we were that we weren't on sooner,'' Hubble
said Thursday when asked whether NBC affiliates had complained
about NBC's coverage.
   However, she added, the complaining station executives proved
understanding when told of the situation at KRON-TV. They also
expressed pleasure at NBC's subsequent non-stop quake coverage,
``even though we were late out of the box,'' she said.

   Televison networks all sent dozens of
staffers to cover the Northern California earthquake, but sheer
numbers couldn't always overcome the enormous difficulties the
story presented.
   Even with million-dollar anchors and squadrons of
correspondents, technicians and producers, the three broadcast
networks and CNN quickly learned it's a grind to deliver
compelling, competitive reports in conditions where rumor and
misinformation have flowed like water.
   ABC anchor Peter Jennings arrived at destroyed Interstate 880 on
Wednesday morning and, minutes later, delivered a live dispatch
that demonstrated the hazards of capturing the story both quickly
and accurately.
   Jennings said rescue workers had labored through the night to
save lives on the collapsed freeway. Anyone who had spent the
early-morning hours there would have said very little happened
after midnight.
   In one of his initial news bulletins Tuesday night from New
York, CBS' Dan Rather played it safe. Not wanting to speculate on
information he didn't have, Rather read major earthquake figures
from an almanac.
   John Carman, the television critic for the San Francisco
Chronicle, said quake coverage by CNN was sometimes as inexact as
it was instant (CNN was on the air six minutes after the quake hit).
   Carman noted that CNN anchors Molly McCoy and Bob Cain were
unfamiliar with such things as local geography and area codes.
   CBS News has heard some complaints, too. ``We've been criticized
from both ends _ for being too cautious and then I had a call that
we're doing too much coverage,'' said spokeswoman Donna Dees.
   After overcoming various initial jitters, all four networks were
praised by TV critics for steady, informative broadcasts. Ratings
were strong, too.
   The three broadcast network newscasts originated Wednesday night
from the earthquake zone, as Jennings was joined in town by Rather
and NBC's Tom Brokaw. CNN sent Atlanta anchor Lou Waters and 25
correspondents. The networks also broadcast prime-time specials on
the disaster.
   In addition, NBC's ``Today'' show was anchored in San Francisco
and CBS' ``48 Hours'' and ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' planned
broadcasts on the quake for Thursday night. NBC News President
Michael Gartner said his network had 60 staffers in the city.
   Andrew Heyward, the executive producer of ``48 Hours,'' said
Thursday the arrival of the network stars testified to the story's
importance. ``There is an advantage for the anchor to be in the
city _ it's certainly better than in the studio,'' Heyward said.
   Indeed, national interest in the TV accounts and mesmerizing
footage has been profound. Preliminary ratings for the ABC, CBS and
NBC specials Wednesday night indicated nearly half of all homes
with television tuned in.
   According to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates, ABC's special, ``The
Great Quake of '89,'' was the highest-rated of the broadcasts,
averaging a 13.2 rating.
   NBC's special, ``Earthquake Aftershock,'' directly competing
with ABC's program at 10 p.m. EDT, was second with a 12.2 rating. A
``CBS Reports'' special, ``The Califoria Earthquake,'' which aired
an hour earlier, averaged an 11.9 rating.
   Each rating point represents 921,000 homes.
   CNN set an all-time viewership record Tuesday night, when more
than 3.6 million homes watched the news network, CNN spokesman
Anthony Masterson said.
   ``The great difficulties are imposed by the loss of power,
traffic jams and obstacles created by the story itself,'' said CNN
Executive Vice President Ed Turner. ``Once you have that
established, the unfolding of the story is not that difficult.''
   Journalistic standards can crumble when dealing with a disaster
such as the San Francisco earthquake, Turner said. ``The greatest
trap is to pass on bad information _ and there's a lot of it out
there _ or create an alarmist atmosphere and scare people. You have
to be judicious in your demeanor.''
   While many are transfixed by the television images, not all are
pleased. Viewers of CBS affiliate KMOV in St. Louis flooded the
switchboard when Tuesday earthquake coverage first interrupted a TV
movie on acquaintance rape.

   House Speaker Tom Foley on Thursday estimated
at least $2.5 billion in federal funds would be needed for
California earthquake damage and said the House would vote next
week to provide it, deficit or no deficit.
   The money will be included in the continuing resolution to be
voted on Tuesday. This is a stopgap money bill needed to keep the
government operating until all the appropriations bills are
approved.
   ``If the deficit has to go up, the deficit will have to rise,''
said Foley, comparing the earthquake to a family emergency. ``If a
family has a tragedy, it may not be in the budget,'' but needs have
to be met, he said.
   Foley said that the federal government is obligated by law to
assist in emergencies such as the earthquake and Hurricane Hugo. He
said the leadership of the House will not make the people of
California, the Carolinas and Virgin Islands suffer because of a
tight federal budget.
   Meanwhile, Former House Speaker Thomas ``Tip'' O'Neill defended
President Bush's response to the earthquake, even though the
president did not visit the scene immediately.
   Foley's comments came after talking to members of the California
delegation who went home to survey the damage. During a telephone
conference call, Rep. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat from San Francisco,
told Foley the scene was ``a heart-breaker'' that would require
funds ``in the billions.''
   Democrat Don Edwards of San Jose, who had just returned to
Washington said ``it's hard to imagine from pictures how bad it
is.''
   Another Democrat, Vic Fazio of Sacramento said Congress has
asked the Office of Management and Budget to estimate by 9 a.m.
Monday how much money will be needed.
   He said he already sees a need for at least $800 million more
for highways and bridges than has been budgeted. He said
legislation would have to be passed to remove certain restrictions
on the amount a single state can get in federal funds for highway
work.
   He also said the Small Business Administration ``is almost out
of money'' and needs at least another $1 billion for California.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said earlier in the day that he
expected the Senate to act next week as well.
   Speaking at a news conference in Dayton, Ohio, O'Neill said: ``I
don't think it's right to criticize the president of the United
States for local disasters because he doesn't appear on the scene.
They do get the apparatus in motion.''
   ``I think he's responded very quickly to the problems out
there,'' O'Neill said.

<HEAD>Two Given Death Sentences for Killing Pandas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Sichuan farmers were sentenced to death and
two others were given life imprisonment for selling panda skins,
the official Xinhua News Agency said Friday.
   An intermediate court in the southwest China province gave Liang
Yongzheng the death sentence for selling seven panda skins for
300,000 yuan, or $81,000. The other condemned man, He Guanghai,
made 30,000 yuan, or $8,100, by selling skins, the agency said.
   It said two of Liang's seven accomplices received life in prison.
   The men were from Pingwu County, a major habitat of the giant
panda. The animal is native to China and only about 1,000 still
survive in the wilds of Sichuan and neighboring Tibet.
   The Chinese government has forbidden hunting of the endangered
species, and courts in Sichuan have repeatedly called for harsh
punishments of people caught killing or selling the animals.
   Several offenders have been given life in prison, although the
death sentence is rare for panda poaching.
   The convicted have the right to appeal, but Chinese courts
rarely accept appeals and executions, with a bullet to the back of
the head, are usually carried out within days of sentencing.

   A judge Thursday convicted 143
men of treason for their role in a failed coup last year against
the leader of the Bophuthatswana tribal homeland.
   M.W. Friedman, a judge in the homeland's Supreme Court in
Mmabatho, said he would begin sentencing on Friday for the men,
most of them soldiers.
   The soldiers seized homeland leader Lucas Mangope on Feb. 10,
1988, and held him hostage for several hours before the South
African military rescued him and returned Mangope to power.
   Bophuthatswana is made up of seven separate patches of land in
north-central South Africa and is one of four nominally independent
black homelands. South Africa is the only nation that recognizes
them as independent.
   The homeland has nearly 2 million people and has been ruled by
Mangope since it was declared independent in 1977.

<HEAD>U.N. Agency Protests Israeli Raids on Food Center, Offices</HEAD>

   The U.N. agency that coordinates aid for
Palestinian refugees said Thursday the Israeli army raided its main
food distribution center and three other offices in the occupied
lands and roughed up two staff workers.
   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency said in a statement issued at
its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, that protests were filed with
the Israeli mission to the United Nations in Vienna and with
Israeli military officials in the territories.
   In Wednesday's raids, the soldiers detained UNRWA workers and
confiscated documents at the food distribution center in the Gaza's
Deir El-Balah camp and at service offices in the West Bank refugee
camps of Dheishe, Fawwar and Jalazoun.
   The UNRWA statement said they ``roughed up and detained'' two
international staff members, Christian Saunders of Britain and
Declan Greenway of Ireland, and detained four Arab workers. All now
are free.
   ``UNRWA has discussed with Israeli authorities the serious
breaches of privileges and immunities which the agency enjoys as an
international body providing humanitarian services,'' it said.
   Asked about the case, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said in Washington, ``We have called on all parties to
exercise maximum restraint to avoid the kinds of confrontations
described in these reports.
   ``As a general matter, we regret any actions that interfere with
the UNRWA's important humanitarian operations in providing
education, medical and relief services to Palestinian refugees.''
   An officer with the military government in the occupied lands
said the troops were investigating reports ``some employees of
UNRWA are either participating in the uprising themselves or aiding
activities of the uprising.''
   The officer, who insisted on anonymity, said he had not seen the
UNRWA complaint and had no comment.
   Claire Grimes, UNRWA spokeswoman in Jerusalem, said, ``We have
no knowledge of any illegal activities inside our installations.
According to staff rules and regulations, political activities are
not permissible.''
   Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. The lands have been torn by a
Palestinian revolt since December 1987. They are home to 1.7
million Palestinians, 820,000 of them refugees who qualify for
assistance from the U.N. agency.
   On Thursday, a 12-year-old boy from the Deir El-Balah camp was
hit in the head with rubber-coated metal pellets fired by the army
as a riot control measure.
   Arab hospital officials said the boy, Abdullah Ishmael Abu
El-Aram, was evacuated ``in extremely critical condition'' to Tel
Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv.
   Five other Palestinians were shot and wounded Thursday in
stone-throwing clashes with troops, including three with head
wounds from rubber-coated metal pellets or rubber bullets.
   Since the uprising began, 596 Palestinians have been killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians. Forty Israelis also have died. An
additional 130 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most
on suspicion of collaborating.

   Five members of the Council of Freely Elected

the last days of that country's voter registration for its national
election in February.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, chairman of the council, said
Thursday that he will assess the group's findings as part of his
monitoring of Nicaragua's election process.
   Carter, who traveled to Nicaragua in September, is not going on
this trip, but he will be among the observers of the Feb. 25

   Carter said the visiting council members will observe voter
registration Sunday and meet with candidates and leaders of

   Along with other council members, Carter monitored last summer's
elections in Panama and denounced them as fraudulent.

   President Bush said Thursday he wanted ``to
take a look and to provide encouragement'' during a tour of
earthquake-shattered Northern California, while House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley pledged up to $2.5 billion in disaster funds from
Congress.
   Foley said that he did not know where all the money would be
found, but promised that the House would provide it in a vote next
week.
   ``If the deficit has to go up, the deficit will have to rise,''
Foley said, comparing the quake to a family emergency. ``If a
family has a tragedy, it may not be in the budget'' but the needs
still have to be met.
   Bush planned to leave Washington before dawn Friday, flying
across country for a five-hour inspection tour of damage sites by
helicopter and car. He planned to make stops in Oakland and Santa
Cruz, two of the most devastated areas.
   Bush announced his trip amid Democratic complaints and
Republican praise over the government's response to Tuesday's
quake, which authorities estimate caused $2 billion in damage.
Initial estimates of more than 250 deaths were proving much too
high, officials said Thursday night without offering new estimates,
and coroners in seven counties reported only 31 bodies recovered.
   The president said he was confident that federal officials were
doing a good job and promised ``we will stay on top of it.''
   After an early-morning flight from Washington, Bush planned to
spend three hours in California on Friday, much of the time in a
helicopter tour.
   ``We'll do as much as we can without disrupting local
activities,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Bush is to fly to Moffett Naval Air Station near Mountain View
and take a helicopter to Alameda on the east side of the San
Francisco Bay, and then drive to Oakland to view the collapsed
Interstate 880.
   He then is to double back to Alameda for a helicopter hop to
Santa Cruz, where there is extensive damage. Tuesday's quake was
the deadliest since the 1906 temblor that killed 2,500 people in
San Francisco.
   Bush flew to South Carolina on a similar inspection mission
after Hurricane Hugo last month, but the federal government was
accused by some officials there of moving too slowly in providing
disaster relief. In this instance, Bush said California Gov. George
Deukmejian, a Republican, had called ``to express appreciation for
the all-out federal effort.''
   However, the Democratic mayor of San Francisco, Art Agnos, said
he was ``ticked off'' that Vice President Dan Quayle had not met
with him during a tour of quake damage.
   Agnos said Quayle ``flies around in a helicopter, makes a bunch
of television spots. ... I have real questions about what he was
ding here. It may have been just a publicity stunt.''
   Agnos was invited to accompany Bush on Friday, along with the
mayors of Oakland and Alameda.
   In Washington, Quayle said all mayors in the quake area had been
invited to a meeting with him. ``I think it's very unfortunate to
take that kind of a shot at a very difficult time.''
   Fitzwater said Agnos had turned away several administration
approaches.
   Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the Army Corps
of Engineers has begun inspecting federal dams and levees, and, at
the request of the state government, state and private dams. So
far, he said, no damage had been discovered in structures checked
within 50 miles of the quake's epicenter.
   A U-2 reconnaissance plane from Beale Air Force Base flew over
the San Francisco area late Wednesday, and Williams said its photos
might help in the detection of structural problems.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said California would be eligible
for federal job-training funds to assist any workers who lost their
jobs because of the quake.
   Bush called Quayle and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
to the Oval Office to report on the helicopter tour they took
Wednesday to damage sites.
   ``Our hearts certainly go out to the victims of this disaster,''
Bush said. ``And I will go out there tomorrow to take a look and to
provide encouragement to the people.''
   Skinner, in an appearance on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America''
program, said, ``All federal resources have been marshaled.''
   Quayle was asked on the NBC-TV ``Today'' show if there was
enough money available for the relief effort. He replied, ``We will
put the maximum that we can behind that, working with state and
local levels of government to clean the situation up.''
   The White House said an initial $273 million will be available
for the area from a pool of $1.1 billion that Congress appropriated
after the devastation caused by Hurricane Hugo.
   As for the flap with Agnos, Fitzwater said the mayor was invited
to two meetings up wherever he was and deliver him to the meetings,
and he declined that.''
   He said Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, had tried to call
Agnos for several days, and ``he declined to talk to us. We regret
very much that the mayor of San Francisco has declined to cooperate
with us in this matte in making sure there is adequate federal
support for the disaster in his city.''

   Computers are giving some worried friends
and relatives around the world their first word about
earthquake-damaged sections of Northern California.
   ``This is sort of like what ham radio operators do, only it's on
a computer,'' said Rich Baker, editorial services manager of
CompuServe. ``It has been instrumental in giving concerned people
the straight scoop. It's getting a lot of the information coming
out of California straight in an accurate and timely manner _ often
more quickly than the news media can.''
   The Columbus-based computer information service, with 550,000
individual and 1,800 corporate customers worldwide, created an
``earthquake forum'' where people could leave messages and
information about 5 p.m. Wednesday. By 11 a.m. Thursday, more than
430 messages _ many seeking information _ had been filed.
   Prodigy, a White Plains, N.Y.-based venture of IBM and Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co., had a system going less than four hours after
Tuesday's quake, said Brian Ek, communications manager. By Thursday
afternoon, 1,530 messages were posted.
   It also put a psychologist on line Wednesday night ``to help
these people deal with the trauma. We had one person who know some
of the people involved in the Nimitz highway situation who was
pretty distraught,'' Ek said.
   Prodigy has subscribers in more than 100,000 U.S. households.
   Many messages sought information about conditions; others were
personal.
   A New England man trying to find a Burlingame, Calif., couple,
learned in about an hour that they not only had survived but had
become grandparents after the quake _ but that one of their fathers
had died the day before Tuesday's earthquake.
   ``Everyone was in good spirits, given the circumstances,'' a
message said.
   Computer samaritans also acted as messengers for those who
couldn't reach loved ones by phone.
   An Oakland woman reported ``for anybody worrying about their
daughter'' at Mills College in Oakland Hills, students were shaken
but fine. ``Talked to my good friend's daughter there who is a
freshman from Utah and her first time away from home. I told her
`Welcome to California,' as she had never ever experienced an
earthquake, let alone a biggie like the SF quake.''
   A man from Italy sought help finding friends vacationing in San
Francisco, but their whereabouts were not known.
   Word also came from San Carlos that damage there ``was primarily
on the nerves,'' and from Santa Clara that a woman sustained no
damage to her house, though her birdbath was tipped over.
   The system is available only to CompuServe members, who pay
$12.50 an hour to dial into the electronic bulletin board through
their personal computers. It is the first time CompuServe has set
up a forum solely for earthquake-related information, though it has
been pressed into service for other disasters.
   Members exchanged information Jan. 28, 1986, when Challenger
exploded, and when the stock market crashed Oct. 19, 1987.
CompuServe also posted messages in the system last month when
Hurricane Hugo swept into the Carolinas.
   The year-old Prodigy charges subscribers a flat $9.95 a month.

   ``I got lucky, but no pushups for a
while.''
   Michael Friedman, a 41-year-old executive, wryly offered that
assessment Thursday from a hospital bed where he was mending after
breaking his breastbone when his car dropped with the collapsing
Interstate 880 freeway.
   ``I thought I was going to die, and that was that,'' said
Friedman, who believes his sternum was broken when his chest
slammed against his seat belt _ but the splintered bone missed
piercing his heart and aorta.
   Alone in his car, Friedman had just left the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday, headen buildings
and plan for
temblors on the New Madrid Fault, which has spawned some of the
strongest U.S. quakes, experts say.
   The quake that rattled the San Francisco Bay area on Tuesday
``has about a 1-in-3 probability of happening on the New Madrid
Fault in the next 10 years,'' said David Stewart of the Center for
Earthquake Studies in Cape Girardeau. ``We can watch what's
happening out there and take a lot of notes.
   ``San Francisco is the best prepared city for an earthquake in
the world. What San Francisco has been doing for a long time is
going to pay off.''
   The California quake, measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale, has
been blamed for 2,000 injuries as well as nearly $3 billion in
damage to property, bridges, highways and rail lines. Early
estimates were that 270 people died, but on Thursday officials said
the death toll could be much lower.
   The earthquake that devastated Soviet Armenia last December also
had a 6.9 Richter reading, but killed 25,000 people and did $16
billion in damage.
   ``Armenia was an example of absolutely no preparation,'' Stewart
said. ``We're not as bad off as Armenia, but we're certainly not
anywhere near as well prepared as San Francisco was.''
   Quakes are much less frequent on the New Madrid Fault, which
runs from Marked Tree, Ark., into southern Illinois, but scientists
say there is a 40 percent to 63 percent chance of a 6.3 quake by
the year 2000.
   ``The New Madrid Fault is probably the most dangerous fault in
the eastern half of the United States, but there is far more danger
of an earthquake on the San Andreas Fault,'' said Douglass Wiens,
assistant professor of earth and planetary sciences at Washington
University. ``But that's not to say that there's not danger. Just
less.''
   The New Madrid Fault has minor earthquakes registering 3 to 4
``almost daily,'' but the last one above 6.0 was in 1985, said
Brian Mitchell, chairman of the department of earth and atmospheric
sciences at St. Louis University.
   In the summer of 1987, a quake of 4.9 hit along the southern
Illinois-Indiana border, causing minor damage. A series of temblors
that ripped through the New Madrid zone in 1811 and 1812 could be
felt in Boston and Washington but occurred in a largely unpopulated
area and the number of deaths is unknown.
   There was no equipment to measure earthquakes in the 1800s, but
scientists say the New Madrid quakes would probably have been up to
8.7. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 is estimated at 8.3. The
1985 Mexico City quake that killed 10,000 measured 8.1 on the
Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While scientists quickly estimate the
magnitude of a quake on the Richter scale, it takes weeks to map
out its intensity on the modified Mercalli scale.
   Northern California's disastrous earthquake on Tuesday had a
magnitude of 6.9, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A quake
can have only a single magnitude, although scientists using
different types of seismometers often come up with different
estimates.
   But a quake can have many intensities. That's because intensity
is a measurement of a quake's actual shaking effects at various
locations. Thus, intensities tend to be highest closest to the
epicenter. But they also can be high at greater distances where
ground is soft.
   Italian seismologist G. Mercalli developed his 12-point
intensity scale in 1902, and it was modified in 1931 by U.S.
seismologists Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann. Roman numerals are
used.
   The areas most hard hit in Tuesday's quake _ locations sitting
on soft San Francisco Bay mud or fill dirt _ may have experienced
shaking as high as IX or perhaps X on the modified Mercalli scale,
California Institute of Technology seismologist Kate Hutton said
Thursday. But she emphasized she was guessing, based on damage she
saw on television.
   In intensity X areas, cracks several inches wide appear in soft
ground, well-built wood buildings and bridges are severely damaged
and some collapse, most masonry structures are destroyed, buried
pipes tear apart or are crushed, cracks and fold open in pavement.
   In intensity IX areas, conspicuous cracks develop in the ground,
damage is great in most masonry buildings and considerable in those
built to withstand quakes, underground pipes sometimes break and
some quake-resistant wood homes shift off foundations.
   Federal scientists usually conduct field interviews and survey
damage to construct a map showing the intensities produced by a
major quake, Hutton said.
   Other intensity scales are used in the Soviet Union and Japan.

<TEXT>
   The Warsaw Pact wound up the third round
of talks on limiting conventional arms in Europe on Thursday by
presenting proposals on curbing maneuvers and exchanging and
verifying military information across the continent.
   In their initial reaction, Western diplomats welcomed the
proposals and noted several concepts and language identical to NATO
proposals on the same subject Sept. 21.
   Negotiators from both blocs at the 23-nation talks hailed the
progress made during the six-week round, but expressed
disappointment that agreement on details is still rare.
   ``Generally, we're making a lot of progress,'' U.S. Ambassador
Stephen J. Ledogar told reporters. ``But specifically, we have not
got much concrete to show for it yet.''
   ``More could have been done,'' said Soviet Ambassador Oleg
Grinevsky.
   The only language agreed by both sides for an initial treaty
both blocs want to sign next year is the definition of artillery.
   Ledogar, Grinevsky and West German Ambassador Ruediger Hartmann
expressed hope the fourth round, beginning Nov. 9 and lasting until
Dec. 21, will see more discussion of specifics.
   The Warsaw Pact proposals presented Thursday contained different
specifics on limiting military maneuvers in Europe than earlier
NATO suggestions. They omitted, for example, mention of limitation
on equipment used in such exercises.
   But the East accepted significant details of the West's
proposal. It agreed that no more than 40,000 men be engaged in
military maneuvers by one bloc, but sought to limit such large
exercises to once every three years, as against once every two
years as proposed by NATO.
   The East also agreed that annual exchange of verification data
take place on Dec. 15 once any treaty is in force, and that 42 days
be the period of prior notification for changing force structures.
   Both sides agreed major differences still exist over the
definition of weapons categories such as tanks, the verification of
armaments levels in different regions of Europe and the inclusion
or exclusion of Soviet air defense interceptors, training aircraft
and certain types of helicopter in the complex aircraft category.
   ``The most urgent problem is definition'' of weapons categories,
said Ledogar. ``The most complex is verification, and I think the
toughest one is still the aircraft issue.''
   The talks opened in March. They replaced negotiations on troop
reductions in central Europe that dragged on for 15 years without
agreement.

<HEAD>Typhoon Elsie Leaves Two Dead in Philippines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Typhoon Elsie moved into the South
China Sea on Friday after battering the northern Philippines and
leaving at least two dead and thousands fleeing to relief centers,
officials said.
   In a final typhoon bulletin at 4 a.m., the Manila weather bureau
said Elsie was 155 miles west-northwest of the mountain resort of
Baguio in Benguet province, about 240 miles northwest of Manila.
   Forecaster Juliet Dagupa said Elsie, which had 127 mph winds
when it blew ashore Thursday, weakened to 103 mph and was moving
west at 14 mph.
   Reports reaching the Red Cross headquarters in the capital said
one person died in La Union's provincial capital of San Fernando
when an acacia tree fell on him. Another died in a landslide in
Baguio, officials added.
   The military's Office of Civil Defense said over 17,000 people
were ``affected,'' meaning they were temporarily sheltered in
schoolhouses and other government centers or their houses were
either damaged or destroyed.
   The office said Elsie's winds sank two tugboats and caused a
British-registered commercial vessel to slam into port at La
Union's Poro Point. No reports of casualties came from the vessels,
officials added.
   Officials said many northern provinces were without electricity
because of toppled power lines. Fallen trees rendered dozens of
roads impassable.
   Manila radio station DZXL said its affiliate in Bayombong,
capital of Nueva Vizcaya province, 130 miles north, was knocked off
the air by a power failure.
   Elsie roared ashore Thursday in Aurora province and weakened to
116 mph as it slammed into the Sierra Mountain range.
   U.S. Air Force officials said some jets were moved to air bases
in Japan and South Korea until the storm passed.

   A healthy Galileo spacecraft sped
unerringly toward distant Jupiter on Thursday, while the five
orbiting astronauts who released it measured the threatened ozone
layer that is Earth's natural sunscreen.
   Racing along at more than 9,000 mph, the probe Thursday night
was more than 260,000 miles out on its 2.4-billion-mile, six-year
journey to study the largest planet in the solar system in a search
for clues to how the universe began.
   Galileo was dispatched from Atlantis' cargo bay Wednesday night,
6{ hours after the shuttle was launched from Cape Canaveral.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials reported
Thursday the craft was in ``perfect shape'' and ``right on course.''
   Atlantis also was pronounced in ``excellent condition'' by
Mission Control after the crew members successfully restored a
cooling system that shut down Wednesday when it overheated and cut
in a backup unit.
   On Thursday, a major solar flare hurled a surge of radiation
toward Earth, but NASA officials said they were not concerned.
   Government scientists said the flare may disrupt communications
and electrical power transmission over the next two days, but NASA
said it had been evaluated and was not considered a problem for the
astronauts.
   ``In the orbit we're in, at 160-mile altitude, it is no threat
at all,'' said flight director Ronald D. Dittemore.
   The burst also has had no impact on Galileo, which is ``built
for much harsher environments than a solar flare,'' said NASA
spokeswoman Paula Cleggett-Haleim.
   Earlier Thursday, Mission Control wakened the space travelers
with a musical tribute to Atlantis commander Don Williams and pilot
Mike McCulley, both naval aviators and graduates of Purdue
University.
   Played were ``Hail Purdue'' and ``Anchors Aweigh,'' with
reveille sandwiched in between.
   The other crew members are Ellen Baker, Franklin Chang-Diaz and
Shannon Lucid.
   They began a series of medical, materials processing and other
experiments that will occupy their time until they return to Earth
on Monday. Landing is scheduled for Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,
at 2:38 p.m. EDT Monday.
   On NASA satellite television Thursday night, Chang-Diaz and Mrs.
Baker demonstrated a retinal photography test on the shuttle's
middeck.
   With swimming goggles strapped around her head, Mrs. Baker
steadied herself while Chang-Diaz pressed a camera to the right
goggle to photograph her retina.
   Researchers said the camera slides should help them determine if
there are any changes in the eye's vessels in zero gravity. Such
changes could indicate some brain swelling, and researchers want to
determine if that is related to motion sickness in space.
   A new shuttle experiment used a sensitive instrument in the
cargo bay to measure sections of the Earth's ozone layer, an area
of the upper atmosphere that protects our planet from most of the
sun's ultraviolet radiation.
   There is global concern over depletion of the ozone layer, and
many people fear its destruction will cause a rise in such human
health problems as skin cancer.
   The information gathered by the Atlantis crew will be compared
with data being collected at the same time and over the same areas
by nearly identical sensors aboard three older U.S. satellites.
   Researchers want the new data so they can accurately calibrate
the satellite sensors. NASA considers the experiment so important
that it has scheduled it for six more shuttle flights.
   ``Accurate, reliable measurements from space are critical to the
detection of ozone trends and for assessing the potential effects
and development of corrective measures,'' the agency said.
   Scientists report the ozone shield has thinned out worldwide by
about 3 percent within the last two decades, with the largest
losses occurring over the polar regions.
   The depletion is thought to be increased by the interaction of
certain manmade chemicals, principally chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, used as refrigerants and in the manufacturing of some plastic
products.
   Some U.S. manufacturers and users of CFCs have announced plans
to stop making the chemical or to guard against releasing it into
the atmosphere.
   Galileo, which slowed from its initial earth-escape velocity of
more than 25,000 mph, has a long way to go on its odyssey that will
take it on a scenic route through the solar system. Its path will
whip it once past Venus, twice around the Earth and within view of
an asteroid before it reaches Jupiter in December 1995.
   The roundabout route is necessary for the 6,000-pound spacecraft
to use the gravity forces of Venus and Earth to gain enough speed
to reach its target.
   Once at Jupiter, Galileo will fire a probe into the Jovian
atmosphere and then orbit the planet for a planned 22-month study.
   Scientists believe the probe could reveal much about the birth
of the universe.
   Because Jupiter has apparently undergone little change from its
beginnings, its composition is thought to resemble the cloud of gas
and dust from which the sun and planets formed. Galileo's
observations could give scientists a better idea of what the early
solar system looked like when it formed 4.6 billion years ago.
   Similarly, the Jovian atmosphere's hydrogen-to-helium ratio
promises to be a vital clue to the validity of the big-bang theory,
which holds that the universe was created in a single explosive
moment more than 15 billion years ago. The ratio is thought to be
about the same as was created at the time of the big bang.

   Pounded by a sudden hail of ethics accusations,
mayoral candidate David Dinkins struggled to regain his footing
Thursday in his heretofore stately stroll toward the election.
   Dinkins, the Democratic nominee, lashed at Republican Rudolph W.
Giuliani, accusing him of ``gutter politics,'' bullying and slander
and threatening to respond with negative attacks of his own.
   The uncharacteristic vitriol underlined Dinkins' dismay over a
week of unrelenting criticism by Giuliani _ who has been trailing
badly in polls in the strongly Democratic city _ much of it
prompted by news reports on Dinkins' handling of a stock sale and a
conflict of interest issue.
   Dinkins' troubles were compounded Thursday, first by Mayor
Edward I. Koch's call for him to release a city investigation of
his failure to file tax returns during 1969-72, then by charges he
ducked taxes more recently by understating the value of stock he
sold to his son, and finally by a racist remark by a black activist
who had worked for his campaign.
   Dinkins, who would be the city's first black mayor, has called
his 1969-72 failure to file tax returns an oversight that he
corrected in 1973.
   Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, accused Dinkins of
intentionally breaking the city ethics law _ punishable, Giuliani
noted, by up to a year in jail.
   At issue, chiefly, was Dinkins' investment in Inner City
Broadcasting, a privately held, highly successful media company
formed in 1972 by his political mentor, former Manhattan Borough
President Percy Sutton.
   In 1986 Dinkins, himself newly elected as Manhattan borough
president, sold his 558 shares of Inner City to his son, David Jr.,
for $58,000, payable with 8 percent annual interest in 1991. He did
not reveal the transaction on financial disclosure forms; aides say
it was an ``installment sales contract'' and thus did not have to
be listed as a gift or receivable note.
   New York Newsday reported Thursday that Dinkins had far
underestimated the stock's value, which has no public market price
because it is not publicly traded.
   Newsday quoted Inner City's general counsel as saying the stock
in 1986 was worth, conservatively, $4,292 per share, or more than
$2 million for Dinkins' shares. Newsday quoted a tax expert as
saying a $58,000 sale price for stock worth much more represented
``a huge gift.''
   Dinkins spokesman David Fishlow maintained that the $58,000
valuation was proper: ``He made appropriate inquiries and valued it
fairly.''
   Fishlow said he did not know with whom Dinkins spoke or by what
formula he valued the stock. The official quoted in Newsday said he
estimated Inner City's worth by a common formula _ 10 times the
company's annual revenues.
   Giuliani also attacked Dinkins' involvement as a city official
in business between Inner City and the city government, even though
the Board of Ethics had warned against it.
   Dinkins had requested the ethics ruling and cited it when he
abstained from a 1987 vote in the Board of Estimate, which handles
contracts and zoning, on a matter involving Inner City. But he
conceded Wednesday that aides sitting in for him on the board voted
in 1987 for a zoning change for Inner City's new office and this
year for a transfer of its cable franchise.
   In another development, Robert C. ``Sonny'' Carson, a black
activist who helped organize a voter drive for Dinkins, scoffed
Thursday at charges that he was an anti-Semite.
   ``I'm anti-white. I don't limit my antis to just being one
little group of people, and I think you would insult me if you
tried to do that,'' Carson said when asked about the accusation
made last week by B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation League.
   Carson insisted he had not been hired by Dinkins' campaign and
personally received no money. The campaign has said it paid Carson
$9,800 to organize the drive for the Sept. 12 Democratic primary.
   Carson's comments prompted a terse statement from Dinkins:
``Sonny Carson's comments represent the kind of bigotry and
intolerance I utterly reject and have fought against my whole life.
Had such comments come to my attention, he would never have played
any role in my campaign.''

   At first, Bruce Stephan thought all four
tires on his car had gone flat, but when the San Francisco-Oakland
Bay Bridge started bouncing and weaving, he realized it was an
earthquake. Then the bridge gave way and he was plunging toward the
San Francisco Bay.
   ``The ground just opened up and the car started going down,''
Stephan said Thursday. ``All I could think is, `I'm going through
the bridge and into the Bay.' ... I knew it was death. I didn't
think there was anything that could stop us.''
   When it was over, Stephan's gray Mazda stopped only inches shy
of plunging into the bay. He was looking at water, his car wedged
in the gap between the collapsed upper deck and split-open lower
deck.
   In a fluke Stephan and his passenger, Janice Freiburger, cannot
explain, they were in the only vehicle on the falling section of
bridge.
   Stephan, 33, of San Francisco, was treated for minor bruises and
released. Freiburger, 41, of Larkspur, was hospitalized with a
cracked sternum, a cracked collar bone and a crack in her spine.
Doctors predict that she will be released early next week.
   ``When I look at it, I can't imagine that neither of us were
(more seriously) hurt,'' Freiburger said from her room at Pacific
Presbyterian Hospital. ``I have injuries, but I'm just fine.''
   Stephan and Freiburger, co-workers at a San Francisco real
estate company, were returning from a project in the East Bay when
they were caught on the bridge.
   ``It all happened in just split seconds,'' Freiburger recalled.
``First there was a moment of utter silence and then boom, an
explosion-type of noise. It all opened up. We went traveling down
like a roller coaster ride, just that fast.''
   ``I closed my eyes real tight and made my mind blank,'' said
Stephan. ``You know how you're supposed to have all those
flashbacks and your whole life flashes before your eyes? That
didn't happen. ... I told Janice, `We're going to die,' and she
said, `No, we're not. Hold on.'''
   After the car stopped, Stephan clambered out the window and onto
the hood of the car before hoisting himself up onto the surface of
the bridge's lower deck. He said he didn't look down as he and a
stranger helped pull Freiburger from the hood to the roadway.
   The pair walked more than a mile to Treasure Island, where they
were examined at a clinic before being taken by ambulance to San
Francisco General Hospital.
   Stephan said he is trying to come to grips with his good fortune.
   ``It seems like it should be more profound. It was kind of a
brush with death, but I don't feel that much different,'' he said.

   A Morehouse College sophomore died in what school
officials said appears to have been a hazing incident in the
nation's oldest black fraternity, and school officials said they
may expel the members involved.
   School officials said the college had suspended the Alpha Phi
Alpha chapter's charter.
   Medical examiners have not determined the cause of death of Joel
A. Harris, 18, of New York, but they said he appeared to suffer
from a heart condition.
   However, his mother, Adrienne C. Harris, said Thursday her son
had been healthy, despite undergoing open-heart surgery when he was
2 years old to correct a birth defect. She said he was born with
holes between the chambers of his heart, which were closed
surgically.
   ``Joel was very active all his life,'' Mrs. Harris said.
   Alpha Phi Alpha state director Robert Willis said the death
occurred Wednesday at a gathering in an apartment for 19 young men
interested in joining the 110,000-member fraternity.
   He said the students told him they met with approximately seven
fraternity brothers and ``were pushed and shoved around'' when they
failed to correctly answer questions about the fraternity.
   ``Next thing they knew, they looked around and the fellow was
lying on the floor,'' Willis said. ``At first they thought he was
faking it, but then when they realized he wasn't faking, they
called 911.''
   Willis said that according to the potential pledges, the
fraternity brothers knew of Harris' history of heart trouble.
   ``Joel wasn't really picked on,'' Willis said. ``They (pledges)
said they didn't see Joel get hit.''
   The fraternity's president, Gregory Burrell, could not
immediately be reached for comment Thursday. The fraternity chapter
does not have a house, there was no telephone listing for Burrell,
and a message left for him at the Morehouse dean of students office
was not immediately returned.
   The fraternity _ the country's oldest black Greek-letter
organization _ prohibits hazing, which also is outlawed in Georgia.
   Morehouse spokesman Robert Bolton said in a statement that the
chapter also had not received clearance from school officials to
``commence their pledge period'' or engage in any form of
off-campus pledge activities.
   School officials said the college also was conducting an
internal investigation and would ``take appropriate disciplinary
action, up to and including dismissal of all participants.''
   ``Clearly, the fraternity is out of line,'' Bolton said.
   Dr. Joseph Burton, Cobb County medical examiner, said an autopsy
of Harris failed to reveal any bruises or visible injuries.
   ``Right now, it looks like he had a cardiac disrhythmia,''
Burton said. ``Exactly what precipitated this, we don't know.''
   Hundreds of students, friends and Morehouse faculty attended a
memorial service for Harris on Thursday. Many students sobbed
openly during the ceremonies and hugged each other afterward.
   ``Everybody who knew him loved him,'' said John T. Saunders III,
who said he was Harris' best friend in high school. ``I loved him.''
   Mrs. Harris said she would campaign to see ``that no more
children in this country will die because of hazing. ... Joel
Harris' mother will work to get it outlawed in all the states. This
is utterly ridiculous. ... This is not right.''
   Morehouse President Leroy Keith called Harris ``a young man with
a well of integrity.''
   Wreaths lined the front of the stage during the service at a
college chapel, and the all-male Morehouse College Glee Club sang
hymns.

   Cable cars returned to the streets of San
Francisco on Thursday, after being stuck in their barn since an
earthquake knocked out electrical power two days earlier.
   By midday, enough traffic signals were working again so that
partial service on the popular tourist attraction could resume.
   Most of the city's landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge,
Coit Tower, Mission Dolores and the colorful Victorian-style homes,
were virtually unaffected by the powerful quake and remained
unruffled and picturesque as ever.
   Automobiles were snaking down the ``Crookedest Street in the
World'' of postcard fame, the block of Lombard on Russian Hill.
   ``The traffic hasn't stopped at all, except Tuesday night when
they closed the street off because a cable car was stuck at the top
of the hill,'' said Jason Doty, who lives on the steep, winding
street. ``Our electricity is still out, but there are no other
problems here.''
   Not all the frequently photographed landmarks got through the
earthquake untouched, of course.
   The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, big sister of the more
colorful Golden Gate, was crippled. Some $4,000 worth of glass was
broken at the Conservatory of Flowers, a huge greenhouse in Golden
Gate Park. At the bayside end of Market Street, the flag atop the
Ferry Building was tilted and the tower clock was still stuck on
Tuesday's late-afternoon earthquake time, 5:04 p.m.
   The Mansion Hotel, a Victorian building in the Pacific Heights
district, rode smoothly through its second major quake.
   ``It stood proud, and it's obviously a survivor. It looks
fragile but it isn't,'' owner Bob Pritikin said of the building
completed in 1887. ``The only damage we found was a crack in a
bathroom ceiling.''
   Alcatraz, called ``The Rock'' by those who did chilly hard time
there when it was a federal prison, certainly lived up to its
nickname. Tourists _ though very few of them _ in the Fisherman's
Wharf area Thursday were pointing their cameras at the bleak island
in the bay.
   ``We like San Francisco,'' Alex Camenisch of Marthalen,
Switzerland, said as he and his family strolled through Fisherman's
Wharf, where there was no power and almost all businesses were
closed.
   They were not planning on staying overnight, however. ``We were
going to stay at a downtown hotel, but now we're going to stay
somewhere else,'' said Camenisch's wife, Esther.
   On Nob Hill, about half the Fairmont Hotel's 500 rooms were
empty as well as dark Wednesday night. A national business group
that had reserved 450 rooms canceled a scheduled meeting.
   ``I was on the phone starting Wednesday morning to groups with
reservations here the next 30 days. News reports have made things
sound pretty dismal, and I wanted to let them know the city was not
burning down,'' said Stan Boyd, director of sales for the Fairmont.
   At the Moscone Center, the city's largest convention center, one
event ended its run Tuesday. The next, a car dealers' gathering set
for Oct. 26, is still scheduled, as well as a convention of 5,000
plastic surgeons beginning Oct. 27.

   A series of at least six earthquakes rumbled
across rural north China late Wednesday and early Thursday,
destroying more than 10,000 homes, killing at least 29 people and
injuring more than 150.
   The quakes, measuring from 5.0 up to 6.1 on the Richter scale,
hit Shanxi and Hebei provinces, the official China Daily said
Friday.
   Most of the destruction occurred in Shanxi province, and the
daily quoted a local Communist Party official there as saying,
``The problem is serious and the casualties may increase.''
   Film footage taken by Shanxi provincial television showed rescue
workers using primitive tools to dig through the rubble looking for
victims; makeshift clinics set up outside to treat people with
broken bones and badly bloodied heads; people in heavy overcoats
huddled around bonfires, and children wrapped in blankets sleeping
in straw outside their destroyed homes.
   Bread and medical supplies were being distributed to the
homeless and injured. China Daily said the army sent 1,000 soldiers
to join rescue efforts.
   The worst quake was centered about 135 miles west of Beijing on
the border of Shanxi and Hebei provinces and struck less than 24
hours after a massive earthquake hit the San Francisco area, but
State Seismological Bureau officials said there was no evidence the
temblors were linked.
   Residents of Beijing felt the tremors, but no reports of damage
surfaced and the bureau said there was no need to take safety
measures in the capital.
   The epicenter was near Datong, famous for its Yungang Caves that
hold thousands of Buddhist paintings and statues dating to the 5th
century. Whether any caves were damaged was not reported. Efforts
to reach Datong by telephone failed.
   The Seismological Bureau said an initial quake hit at 10:57 p.m.
Wednesday (10:57 a.m. EDT) and measured 5.7 on the Richter scale.
At least four others registering 5 or above hit in the next six
hours, including a quake of 6 on the scale at about 1 a.m. Thursday
(1 p.m. EDT Wednesday).
   An aftershock measuring 5.1 hit at 6:29 p.m. (6:29 EDT
Thursday), the official Xinhua News Agency said. More than 300
lesser aftershocks were recorded.
   For many hours, almost no details were available from the
government or official media about extent of damage.
   China's prime time national news program gave extensive time on
Thursday to Premier Li Peng inspecting a stadium and a continuing
campaign against pornography, but failed to mention the killer
earthquake that was felt in Beijing.
   It takes days for details of many major disasters to be
reported, and many, particularly industrial accidents, are still
ignored by the official press.
   The region affected by the Wednesday-Thursday quakes is a dry,
windswept farming area, where wheat and other grains are grown and
where most homes are built one-story high of unfired clay bricks,
vulnerable to collapse in an strong quake.
   Shanxi also is China's main coal-producing province.
   Earthquakes are frequent in China. Last month one hit southwest
Sichuan province, injuring 54 people and destroying 4,000 homes.
Five earthquakes with magnitudes registering up to 6.7 on the
Richter scale hit western Sichuan in June and July, killing 11
people.
   China's worst earthquake in recent history leveled Tangshan in
the northeast in 1976, with a magnitude estimated at up to 8.2. The
official count listed 240,000 dead, but unofficial estimates put
the toll at three times that. That time, it was years before the
outside world learned the extent of the catastrophe.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground movement as recorded by
seismographs. The open-ended scale is logarithmic, meaning each
degree of intensity is 10 times stronger than the last. Thus the
6.9 quake that hit San Francisco would be 10 times stronger than
one registering 5.9.
   Bureau director Fang Zhangsun told Xinhua transportation and
communications in the quake area remained intact and relief work
was in progress, but he gave no details.
   Xinhua on Thursday devoted five paragraphs to the tremors in its
English-language service, two of which were concerned with saying
the quake had nothing to do with the one in San Francisco.
   The San Francisco quake, by contrast, made the evening news
Wednesday night.
   Unlike the Soviet Union, which won wide international sympathy
by allowing foreign journalists and relief organizations to go to
Armenia when an earthquake devastated that region last December,
foreigners were barred from going to Yunnan, where an earthquake
killed 730 a month earlier.
   When reporters asked the Foreign Ministry for permission to
cover Thursday's quakes, they were told to write a formal letter of
request.

<HEAD>Nine Miners Arrested in Bombing of Coal Mine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILBURN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine United Mine Workers members were
arrested Thursday in connection with a series of bombings at a coal
mine that has been the target of a union strike for five years.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Carey said the arrests culminated an
investigation by a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
task force looking into mine bombings.
   Arrested for conspiracy to use explosives at Milburn Colliery
were Russell Lee Delung of Dothan; Jesse Harvey, Raymon Thomas and
Julian Wriston of Scarbro; Alan Ray Sharp and Michael Woodson of
Oak Hill; Darrell Ray Sharp of Minden; and Billie Lafferty of Mount
Hope.
   Each faces five years in prison and $250,000 in fines if
convicted, U.S. Attorney Michael Carey said Thursday.
   Larry Massey of Burnwell was charged with destroying property
involved in interstate commerce, Carey said. He faces 10 years in
prison and $250,000 in fines, Carey said.
   All nine were arraigned before U.S. Magistrate Charles
Cunningham in Bluefield and are free on bond.
   The mine, which has been operated by Mountain Minerals Inc.
since last May, has been the target of a strike by about 45 miners
from UMW Local 5948 since Oct. 8, 1984. The walkout is not
connected to the union's larger strike against Pittston Coal Group,
which began last April.
   Last June, a bomb was set off at a bridge entrance to the mine,
and a July fire resulted in about $400,000 damage, Carey said.
   Last month, a bomb caused about $35,000 damage to a mine
ventilation system. Also last month, authorities disarmed a
57-pound time bomb set to explode, Carey said.
   Neither the arrested miners nor local union leaders could be
reached for comment Thursday night.
   UMW national spokesman Joe Corcoran said the union was unaware
of any evidence implicating the nine.
   ``In any strike situation, there are many allegations and
accusations that turn out not to be true,'' he said.

   A single-engine plane crashed into a
building while trying to land Thursday at an airport in eastern
Paraguay, killing seven people and injuring 10 others, government
radio said.
   Believed to be among the dead in the crash outside City of the
East, formerly Stroessner City, were some members of the security
group guarding President Gen. Andres Rodriguez, according to
government radio.
   The security group was in City of the East, 235 miles east of
the capital Asuncion, in advance of a visit planned Friday by
Rodriguez, who came to power in February in a coup that deposed
former dictator Alfredo Stroessner.
   The government said late Thursday that the visit by Rodriguez
had been suspended because of the accident.
   The pilot and co-pilot, members of the Paraguayan Air Force,
died in the crash of the Brazilian-made Tucano, the station
reported, as did three policemen and two airport personnel. No
cause of the crash was given.
   It was not clear whether the other fatalities were aboard the
plane, or were in the airport building. The injured were
transported to nearby hospitals, the report said, but their
conditions and identities were not immediately available.
   The airport belongs to the government agency constructing Itaipu
Dam on the Parana River, one of the largest hydroelectric projects
in the world.
   City of the East is the closest Paraguayan municipality to the
dam.

   An 18-year-old man pleaded innocent to
second-degree murder charges Thursday in the fiery deaths of six
Kansas City firefighters last year.
   Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Lee E. Wells refused to lower
a $1.5 million bond set for Bryan E. Sheppard, but he agreed to
hold a bond hearing soon to discuss the amount.
   Sheppard was charged Sept. 25 with six counts of second-degree
murder and one count of knowingly burning. Prosecutors contend he
set fire to construction trailers filled with explosives before
dawn the morning of Nov. 29. Six firefighters died as they fought
the blaze.
   His lawyer, John P. O'Connor, said the defense would revolve
around Sheppard's contention that he was home that morning.
   Sheppard is the only person charged in the crime, but
authorities have said they expect to make more arrests.

   Police said they arrested the personal
pilot of Colombia's alleged cocaine godfather Thursday and will
hold him for extradition to the United States.
   The pilot, Jorge de la Cuesta Marquez, is wanted in Florida on
charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, national police Col.
Oscar Pelaez Carmona said in a news release. He identified De la
Cuesta as the pilot of Pablo Escobar, leader of the Medellin
cocaine cartel.
   Pelaez would say only that De la Cuesta was arrested in an
apartment in northern Bogota.
   With De la Cuesta's arrest, five Colombians await extradition to
the United States. Colombia earlier extradited four others.
   None is on the U.S. Justice Department's list of the 12 most
wanted drug suspects in Colombia.
   An army official said Thursday the army detained Dairo Chica, a
well-known Colombian bullfighter, as a low-level drug trafficker in
a raid on a farm outside of Medellin.
   The official, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity, said Chica was among four people captured.
   Press reports said Chica was wanted for extradition to the
United States on drug-trafficking charges, but the official could
not confirm this.
   In Mexico City, authorities said they captured the nephews of
two Colombian drug kingpins and broke up a ring that flew cocaine
into Mexico via the Yucatan Peninsula and shipped it by boat to
Florida.
   Federal police commander Fausto Valverde, head of Mexico's
narcotics interdiction forces, said the two _ identified as Luis
Alfredo Aguilar Castro, a nephew of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, and
Ricardo Isunza Ochoa, a nephew of Fabio Ochoa _ were seized with
eight other men Sunday at a clandestine airstrip in the Yucatan.
   President Virgilio Barco resumed extraditions on Aug. 18
following the slayings of a leading presidential candidate, a
federal judge, and a police colonel by drug barons.
   Another federal judge was killed by a gunman in Medellin on
Tuesday, three days after three Colombians were extradited.
   A group calling itself the Extraditables said in a telephone
call to a Medellin radio station the murder was in revenge for the
extraditions carried out so far.
   Barco says he will not back down in his war on drug traffickers.
The traffickers replied they prefer a grave in Colombia to a jail
cell in the United States. They killed a governor, bombed two
newspapers, killed eight news media employees and set off 164
explosions in an effort to force the government to call off
extraditions.
   The explosions at banks, shopping areas, hotels, schools and
government offices have killed 16 people.
   The latest occurred Wednesday in Bogota's main plaza when a hand
grenade exploded, apparently accidentally, and killed the man
carrying it.
   The man was only steps from the building of the national
congress.
   About 17,000 Colombian judges and judicial employees, meanwhile,
said they were ending a 72-hour strike Thursday night and will
return to work Friday despite the government's inability to address
their security concerns.
   Consuelo Herrera, a board member of the court workers' union,
said Justice Minister Roberto Salazar Manrique told the board
Tuesday the government did not have the resources to increase
protection for judges threatened by drug traffickers.
   ``He told us that the U.S. aid for us had not arrived and that
the government could do nothing for us without it,'' Ms. Herrera
told the AP by telephone.
   In September, the Bush administration pledged $19 million in
U.S. aid to protect Colombia's judges.
   The walkout has paralyzed most courts here since Tuesday.
   Ms. Herrera said judges and court workers were returning to work
with the certainty more of them will be murdered.
   ``We can't shut down the court system for very long because it
is just too important,'' she said. ``But the next time one of us is
assassinated _ and it is sure to happen _ we will go on strike
again.''

<HEAD>State Reopens Probe Into Reporter's Death, Sources Say</HEAD>

   A state grand jury has begun a new investigation
into the 1976 car-bomb slaying of investigative reporter Don
Bolles, sources said Thursday.
   The grand jury has already issued subpoenas for several
witnesses, including people in California or Colorado, said sources
familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Although the man who planted the remote-control bomb that killed
the Arizona Republic reporter was found guilty and imprisoned, no
mastermind has ever been convicted.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin, who has come under fire for his
handling of the Bolles case, declined to comment on any grand jury
matter, but confirmed that his office had been working on the
Bolles case for more than a year.
   Witnesses subpoenaed in California or Colorado may be entitled
to a court hearing before any Arizona subpoenas are honored,
sources said.
   The sources demanded anonymity because they feared prosecution
under an Arizona law making it a crime to dislose grand jury
matters.
   Bolles clung to life for 11 days after the bomb went off,
repeatedly saying the word ``Emprise,'' an apparent reference to a
company later called Delaware North that runs dog and horse racing
tracks.
   Racing dog owner John Adamson was convicted of murder for
planting the bomb that killed Bolles.
   Adamson, testifying at the trial of Max Dunlap of Phoenix and
James Robison of Chandler, said Dunlap had asked him to kill Bolles
because of the reporter's articles about a wealthy benefactor of
Dunlap unrelated to the company.
   Dunlap and Robison were convicted and sentenced to death, but
the verdicts were overturned on appeal. Attempts to try them again
were put on hold when Adamson refused to testify again unless he
got a better deal from prosecutors.
   Corbin's office then withdrew the deal under which Adamson had
been sentenced to 48 years in prison in exchange for his earlier
testimony, and prosecuted him again.
   He was convicted and sentenced to death, but a federal appeals
court in San Francisco threw out the sentence _ and Arizona's death
penalty in general _ as unconstitutional. That ruling has been
appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Corbin, a Republican who is up for re-election next year, has
come under increasing pressure over the Bolles case. His only
announced opponent for the GOP nomination, Tucson attorney David
Eisenstein, has made the case a centerpiece of his campaign.
   Eisenstein on Thursday questioned the timing of the grand jury
leak.
   ``I find it very interesting that there is a grand jury working
on it just a month after I pointed out that he hadn't done anything
about it for 11 years,'' Eisenstein said. ``I'm curious, but at the
same time I'm encouraged.''

   The reek of gasoline dripping from
flattened cars and trucks mingled Thursday with the aroma from
eucalyptus trees splintered by tons of concrete crashing to the
streets below.
   On the railing of the flattened upper deck of Interstate 880,
markers of flourescent green, pink and orange spray paint point the
way to crushed cars and shattered bodies.
   The code is crisp and clear: The letters 1DOA signified a body,
2MT a pair of empty cars, a circle and arrow with the number 43
showed a car 43 feet away.
   Here and there, blood spatters the highway's underside.
   Two days ago, 3-foot-thick concrete supports turned to dust,
2-inch steel reinforcing bars bent like pipecleaners, and chunks of
freeway cascaded like runaway boulders when an earthquake collapsed
a mile-long section of I-880, the Nimitz Freeway.
   Early estimates put the number of dead at 250 people, but by
Thursday, officials said they expected the total would be lower _
possibly much lower.
   Gov. George Deukmejian said he would likely appoint a board to
look into the failure of the freeway, which was partially
reinforced in 1977 to make it less prone to damage from earthquakes.
   During a live broadcast of the CBS television show ``48 Hours''
on Thursday, an angry parent who believes his son may be buried in
the Cypress rubble confronted Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson.
   ``Mayor, did you know that you are directly responsible for this
here mess, this disaster?'' asked Daniel Rubi of San Francisco.
Rubi said he had been turned away on Wednesday when he asked to
climb the freeway structure and search for his son, Juan.
   The mayor replied, ``I'm sorry, I can't answer that question.''
   Police took Rubi from the scene in a squad car. Oakland jail
officials reported he was not arrested.
   Across from the rubble, just outside the Pacific Pipe Co., a
salesman who would identify himself only as Dennis stood on the
sidewalk Thursday, still shaken by what he had seen.
   ``It just was one single POW!'' Dennis said. ``The concrete made
so much dust you couldn't see anything.
   ``After you got out here it was so quiet, all you could hear was
people screaming. Anybody who could move was getting out. We got
some ropes. The thought everyone had was that this was the way it
was everywhere. We didn't know how long it would be before help
came.''
   One who came to help was David Horn, a firefighter from
neighboring Berkeley.
   ``It was a mess,'' said Horn, who returned Thursday to see how
the scene appeared in daylight. ``It looks worse to me today. You
always look at the dangers, but they don't affect you so much in an
emergency.
   ``There was cars this tall,'' he said, holding his hand level
below his knee, ``and arms sticking out of them.
   ``At first, I though we should be a lot more frantic, but then I
realized there was no way life could be supported in there.
   ``But we never gave up hope,'' he added. ``It's been proven some
people could survive. Some places might not support an adult, but
would support a child.''
   Chainsaws roared and hammers pounded Thursday as carpenters and
ironworkers used 20-30-foot lengths of 12-inch timbers and 16-inch
pipe to shore up the bottom deck of the highway.
   Others on the top deck used heavy machines called concrete
nibblers to break holes to reach each crushed vehicle. The concrete
railing of the lower deck was being punched out by a huge backhoe
fitted with a steel ram to allow rescuers inside.
   Black soot marked where gasoline had caught fire and burned
within the wreckage, out of reach of help.
   On the sidewalk below, hundreds of expensive bottles of wine and
champagne lay unbroken where they had been thrown when a rental
truck was pitched from the overpass.
   Blankets were heaped on the sidewalk in front of a warehouse
where injured people had been comforted.
   Construction worker Brad Elfring, wearing an orange safety vest
and a hardhat, got up from a cot in a loading bay where he had
napped after working straight through from Tuesday, when he came in
from Sacramento.
   ``You sleep a few hours and go back to work,'' he said. ``You
try to ignore it (the carnage around him) and just do your job.''
   A burly carpenter who refused to give his name said he had seen
incredible bravery by his fellow carpenters and ironworkers.
   ``That whole damn structure was shaking when a cat (caterpillar
tractor) went by and guys were in there shoring up under there,''
he said. ``I saw people crawling in there in places where they
weren't sure a branch was holding them up, running torches in
places they weren't sure there was gas because they had to.
   ``Four carpenters worked 'til 2 this morning and went to their
regular jobs at 7 and they'll be back tonight,'' he said. ``We're
here just because we believe in it.''
   Oakland Police Sgt. Bob Crawford said he thought the death toll
would ultimately be far less than the 250 first estimated. The
earthquake hit while many people were already home in front of
televisions or across the bay at Candlestick Park for the third
game of the World Series between the Oakland A's and the San
Francisco Giants.
   ``Normally at 5 o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon the traffic in
this area would be bumper to bumper,'' Crawford said. ``We thought
at first it might be 200 or 300 (dead).
   ``But it was World Series day and the traffic was light. We
might get lucky on this one because of the World Series.''

ruled the country for 18 years and overseen construction of the
Berlin Wall.
   Honecker, 77, said he stepped down because of health reasons,
but rising public dissatisfaction with his authoritarian rule had
fueled pressure for his resignation. Tens of thousands of East
Germans have fled to the West this year and the country's largest

   More than half of the multi-billion dollar
federal Superfund is being spent on studies, management and
ineffective technology instead of cleaning up toxic waste dumps, a
congressional study said today.
   ``Analysis breeds paralysis,'' declared the report by Congress'
Office of Technology Assessment in calling for a major overhaul of
the Superfund program. Tinkering and fine-tuning won't solve the
program's massive problems, the study said.
   Perhaps as little as a third of the money spent thus far has
gone for decontamination of toxic waste sites, the report said.
Since 1980, Congress has earmarked some $10 billion under the
Superfund program for cleanup work through 1992. About half of the
money has been appropriated so far to the Environmental Protection
Agency.

   ``After 25 years of public neglect, Medicaid is nothing short of
Uncle Sam's poor stepchild,'' said Jon E. Vice, chairman of the

Institutions. ``For too many children, it is not better medicine
that is needed to improve their health, but better politics.''
   The group said the federal-state health care system should be
reformed to ensure coverage for all children and pregnant women to
185 percent of the federal poverty level, allow those with higher
incomes to buy into Medicaid, and expand benefits for eligible
children.

   In 18{ years in a meatpacking plant, Dave Kellen's wages have
helped build his house, put food on the table and raise two
daughters. But, he says, he has paid a terrible price: the use of
his hands.
   Kellen's hands are too weak to chop wood, much less twist open a
bottle. He blames it on years of such jobs as tearing gobs of fat
from hogs, repeating the same few steps, struggling to keep pace
with hundreds of carcasses an hour.
   His employer, John Morrell &amp; Co., says plant safety is improving
and is contesting a $4.3 million government fine for allegedly
allowing dangerous work conditions. Meanwhile, Kellen, 41, who has
endured surgery twice on each hand, now sweeps floors at the Sioux
Falls, S.D., plant. And he's worried.
   ``I'm sitting here with my hands 37 percent crippled. They're
what's got to make my living for the next 20 years,'' he said. ``Is
Morrell going to be there? Are my hands going to get worse? I don't
know who'd be willing to hire me. That's what's got me scared. ...
It's like going blind slowly.''
   Such problems go beyond one man, one company or one occupation.
   Many union, safety and academic experts say Kellen is an example
of an insidious trend in American industry: Companies are producing
more, cutting payrolls, modernizing, computerizing _ and creating a
more hazardous workplace.
   ``People are getting hurt more than they ever were,'' argues
Joseph Kinney, director of the National Safe Workplace Institute.
``They're under more pressure to produce than they ever were. A lot
of companies that once were using seven workers to do a job are now
asking five to do it.
   ``The new fat-free American business syndrome is asking those
who are left to do too damn much.''
   Similar concerns have surfaced from congressional hearings to
union organizing drives, in auto, meatpacking, construction, steel
and other industries. Experts say automation, competition and the
changing business landscape play a role.
   ``We live in a time of corporate downsizing, mergers and
acquisitions and leveraged buyouts that end or greatly diminish
many of the modest safety and health programs that exist,'' said a
September report by the workplace institute. ``The raiders and
downsizers are unwitting participants in our industrial carnage.''
   While most workers no longer confront sweatshop horrors and
archaic equipment, some experts say a new trend in which technology
allows experienced employees to be replaced by those with less
training has contributed to increasing dangers.
   Others disagree, noting large investments that companies,
including the Big Three automakers, are making to improve plant
designs. They also cite giant government penalties against lead,
paper, meatpacking, construction and other firms that are serving
as a deterrent.
   ``I think workplaces are generally safer,'' said Berrien
Zettler, deputy director of compliance programs at the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration.
   Kinney's group says OSHA has improved, but he cites government
numbers: the average number of workdays lost due to on-the-job
accidents for each 100 workers rose from 58.5 days in 1983 to 69.9
days in 1987.
   And the National Safety Council says permanent work-related
disabilities rose from 60,000 in 1986 to 70,000 in 1987.
   Safety experts speculate conditions may be even grimmer because
companies underreport injuries to avoid OSHA inspections. In fact,
the government has cited Union Carbide Corp., USX Corp. and others
for alleged recordkeeping violations.
   Ironically, some trace rising injuries to economic prosperity,
especially in steel. One steelworkers' local says its injury rate
nearly doubled when overtime peaked.
   ``When you're tired and you work in a dangerous operation,
fatigue is going to lead to accidents,'' said Mike Wright, the
United Steelworkers of America's health and safety director.
   A 1988 University of Texas study found nearly 93 percent of
injury increases in durable goods industries could be explained by
overtime and employee turnover.
   Those aren't the only culprits.
   ``Automation is increasing and the workers who performed a
variety of the jobs are being replaced by machinery,'' said Bob
Hall, research director at the Institute for Southern Studies in
North Carolina.
   ``The jobs that are left are not as complicated ... (and)
increasingly treat people as robots ... (and treat) arms and hands
like they're part of a machine. But you can't oil a person's arm or
hand.''
   Workers who cut, chop or pull thousands of times daily have
developed painful and sometimes disabling hand, arm and wrist
ailments, known as repetitive trauma disorders. The most severe
form is called carpal tunnel syndrome, a thickening or swelling of
tendons in the wrist.
   Repetitive trauma disorder cases _ including hearing loss _
soared from 26,700 to 72,940 from 1983 to 1987, the government
says, though some attribute part of that to heightened awareness.
   Much publicity has focused on meatpacking where, the United Food
and Commercial Workers Union says, production jumped nearly 20
percent in the last five years while production employees dropped
by almost 10,000.
   ``When line speeds are increased and the workforce is decreased
in the name of efficiency, injuries go up,'' said Debbie Berkowitz,
the union's health and safety director.
   Meat and poultry workers, some of whom have testified before
Congress, have complained about treacherously fast production
lines, where meat flies off damaged conveyor belts and blood
splatters in their faces. They have described cysts, infections and
crippling hand and back pains that make it hard to lift their
children, comb their hair or hold a glass.
   Former poultry employee Lillie Watson worked as a packer and leg
cutter for nearly a decade, making thousands of cuts a day. She had
surgery three times on her hands, has arthritic legs and says she
can't scrub floors or lift heavy pots.
   ``I feel bitter and angry,'' she said. ``Ain't no job I can get
where I can use my hands occasionally.''
   Workers such as Miss Watson often don't have many options,
either because of the scarcity of job opportunities or limited
education.
   Another injured worker, Bev Whaley, said she had surgery on her
right hand because of her job at the Morrell plant in Sioux Falls.
She said a doctor told her she'd have to ``learn to live with it. I
wanted to take a baseball bat and smash his hands and tell him he'd
have to learn to live with it.''
   Her union local claims assembly line speeds have increased in
many areas; for example, in the beef kill department _ where the
animal is knocked out, its throat slit, the hide pulled off and the
body split in half _ the hourly rate jumped from 105 an hour in
1979 to 193 in 1986.
   Said co-worker Kellen, ``You're just pushed to the limit,''

   But companies dispute the charges. Poultry producer Perdue Farms
Inc. recently estimated repetitive trauma disorders at its plants
at less than 1 percent.
   And though OSHA contends Morrell knew conditions were causing
injuries but did nothing, company spokesman Raoul Baxter said
safety-improvement efforts were being made and the agency reviewed
records during an atypical time _ a period that included a strike.
   In 11 months, records showed 880 of 2,000 workers sustained
repetitive strain injuries. Baxter said there are no quick-fix
programs for such injuries. ``It's going to take a lot of hard
work,'' he said. ``Our progress has been dramatic.''
   Morrell says injuries at Sioux Falls fell per 100 workers from
70.5 in January 1988 to 13.48 in July 1989. Baxter attributed the
high injury rate to the hiring of replacements and other strike
effects; for the decline, he credited outside consultants, workers
and supervisors.
   But Jim Lyon, union local president, said he hasn't seen any
safety progress and said company numbers are ``totally
inaccurate.'' He also contends a program providing prizes for
injury-free records encourages people not to report them.
   Morrell isn't the only meatpacker to come under government
scrutiny.
   OSHA also fined the nation's largest meatpacker, IBP Inc., but a
$5.7 million penalty was reduced to $975,000 after the company
agreed to conduct a three-year safety program to reduce motion
injuries.
   A recent workplace institute study of several large penalties
found OSHA had bargained fines down from $29.3 million to $9.5
million.
   And in cases where OSHA fines are smaller _ in the thousands of
dollars _ the agency ``is not effective in providing the stimulus
employers need to properly deal with safety and health,'' said John
Moran, a former official of the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health. ``The bottom line in business is the dollar
bill.''
   OSHA's Zettler said his agency usually doesn't reduce penalties
by more than half. In IBP's case, he said, ``we believe the
significant reduction was justified by what we were getting back.''
   Zettler also conceded OSHA doesn't have staff to inspect all
hazardous places annually and it may cost more to comply than pay a
penalty. ``If it takes us 15 years to get there, the guy has saved
that investment for 15 years,'' he said.
   But he says his agency has increased safety awareness and most
major companies have health experts. Many also have hired safety
design experts.
   One is the University of Michigan's Center for Ergonomics.
   Director Don Chaffin believes it's simplistic to blame
productivity alone for increased injuries and says corporations are
paying more attention to these concerns.
   But one union local disagrees. At the Allegheny Ludlum Corp.,
plant in Brackenridge, Pa., maintenance division injuries jumped
from 27 percent to 45-47 percent during four heavy overtime months
in 1988, said Carol Mochak, USW local 1196's safety chairman.
   ``People tend to overlook a lot of safety procedures,'' he said.
``They're lax in wearing safety equipment. ... All they want to do
is get the job done as quickly as possible.''
   A spokesman for the specialty steelmaker said the company tries
hard to limit overtime and has no serious safety problems.
   Productivity also has been an issue in construction, said Moran,
the former NIOSH official who now works at a firm that trains
hazardous waste cleanup workers.
   ``It's been getting worse for the last several years _ the
economic pressures, the greater and greater emphasis on cutting
costs,'' he said.
   ``It's `Get it done faster.' If you're laying a pipeline, you
save money as a contractor by not putting in proper shielding or
shoring in the trench.''
   He said in 96 percent of trench cave-in deaths he studied at
NIOSH, there was no shoring or sloping.
   Shortcuts in the name of efficiency are ultimately uneconomical,
said Berkowitz of the United Food and Commercial Workers. ``Any
gains made by pushing people will be eaten up by high turnover and
worker compensation.''
   As for Kellen, he has agreed to a workers compensation
settlement of more than $16,600.
   But he asks: ``What's the price on your hands? You've got to
provide for your family. There was a time when everybody thought of
retiring there after 30 years. I don't look for any future there at
all. It's a sad deal.''

<HEAD>Foreign Priests Bolster Ranks of U.S. Catholic Clergy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   With enrollments in U.S. seminaries flat and the supply of
foreign-born Irish dried up, the Roman Catholic Church is seeking
non-traditional sources to ease a worsening shortage of priests.
   Clergy from the Philippines, Haiti, Korea, India and other
nations have been coming to the United States to provide
sacramental help to a new generation of immigrants.
   ``American bishops _ they want priests. They don't care whether
they speak with a Gaelic brogue, a Spanish accent or a Polish
accent. They want priests,'' said the Rev. Frank Koper, rector of a
seminary for Polish priests in Orchard Lake, Mich.
   While many welcome the new priests for their ability to serve
immigrants from their native lands, other Catholic leaders worry _
that the newcomers will struggle with the more liberal U.S. church
and that they're being used to stall discussion on other solutions
to the clergy shortage, such as opening the priesthood to women and
married men.
   ``I think it's an approach to the priest shortage, and I think
there are other creative ways,'' said Sister Christine Matthews of
Cincinnati, executive director of the National Association of
Church Personnel Directors. ``I think we can find resources withi
our Catholic community.''
   While diocesan ordinations increased this decade in South
America, Africa, Asia and Europe, they continued to decline in the
United States, falling from 593 priests ordained in 1980 to 470 in
1987. Nearly two-thirds of all American priests were ordained
within local dioceses, while the other third were ordained by
religious orders.
   A study by the Hartford Seminary's Center for Social and
Religious Research in Connecticut said last year the number of
Catholic seminarians declined from 8,885 in 1965 to 4,063 in 1985.
The study further estimated the brotherhood of priests would
decline 40 percent by the year 2000. The total number of American
priests has dropped to 53,000 this year from 59,200 in 1970.
   The shortage of priests has forced some Catholic churches to
merge congregations or to close for good. A parish that might have
been served by five priests may now be down to one or two. The
ratio of worshipers to priests has gone from about 700 per priest
in 1955 to almost 1,000 today.
   From the waves of Irish priests who arrived in the 19th century
_ the so-called ``FBI'' connection _ to the immigration of Italian
priests early in this one, plenty of historical precedent exists
for the new wave of foreign-born priests to follow their flocks
overseas.
   ``The only change is it's 1989 rather than 1889,'' said Richard
Dowd, editor of CRUX, an international newsletter for clergy and
religious people. ``We've become ethnically conscious again, so we
may want to have a Polish priest running a Polish parish, or an
Italian priest running an Italian parish.''
   No hard figures exist on the number of foreign priests who have
entered the United States in recent years, but 1,000 is ``probably
a good guess,'' according to the Rev. Peter Zendzian, associate
director of Migration and Refugee Services for the United States
Catholic Conference. The conference has just begun negotiations
with bishops from India for an exchange of priests.
   Zendzian said this latest wave of non-European immigration is
different.
   ``In previous migrations, priests came with their people and it
just worked out,'' said Zendzian. ``We've seen this day and age so
many different people who have come from so many different
countries in such a short time.''
   For example, he said, there are 1 million Filipinos in the
United States, an estimated 85 percent of whom are Catholic.
   If priests are not sensitive to their needs, Zendzian said,
``they strip away their old culture, their old value system, then
they strip away their faith, and they're left with nothing.''
   Some bishops also say they value the mix of faith and alien
culture offered by foreign priests.
   ``The richness that we have from other countries, from other
cultures, is very good for us,'' said Auxiliary Bishop Augustin A.
Roman of the Archdiocese of Miami. ``I think culture is the door to
communication.''
   At the SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary for Polish priests in
Orchard Lake, Mich., enrollment has grown from 10 students in
1983-84 to 75 this year. Most were born in Poland, where the number
of seminarians increased from 5,325 in 1978 to 8,069 in 1987,
according to Koper.
   In the United States, where more than 2 million Polish-speaking
Catholics live, diocesan bishops want to add 75 Polish-speaking
priests to the 2,250 already here, Koper said.
   But others say the influx of foreign priests may create problems
in a church that has grown more liberal since the Second Vatican
Council ended in the mid-1960s. The hierarchical Catholic church
has evolved into one in which laypeople play major roles in
everything from running church schools to distributing communion.
   The Rev. Joseph Brink of Covington, Ky., president of the
National Federation of Priests' Councils, said the ``real problem
is cultural.''
   While the U.S. church has moved toward shared responsibility
among bishops, priests, religious and laity, ``In a lot of other
countries the priest does everything.''
   The Rev. James Hennesey, a Catholic historian at Canisius
College in Buffalo, N.Y., said the risk in importing foreign clergy
was that ``you tend to keep priests cut off in the form of a
caste.''
   Hennesey said there was another message: ``This thing seems to
say: Any priest will do.''
   The Rev. David Brinkmoeller, executive director of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops' Secretariat for Priestly Life and
Ministry, said, ``The last thing any ministry needs is just plain,
old warm bodies.''
   Brinkmoeller and others say the church should be exploring other
options beyond foreign priests, such as consolidating additional
parishes or aggressively selling the priesthood to young men as a
positive, active calling. Hennesey and Sister Matthews suggest
dropping the barriers to married and women priests.
   ``I wonder if this is a sign from providence we have to look
that way,'' Hennesey said. ``As an overall solution, I don't see
why we can't consider we're being moved in the direction of
ordaining married men.''

<TEXT>
   Those whose youthful ambitions were nourished by
Horatio Alger might not find much new in this story, but a few
adult cynics might very well be surprised.
   It really is true that long hours, hard work and good service
are keys to entrepreneurial success. You are assured of this by a
detailed, three-year study of nearly 3,000 business owners and
companies.
   The study takes its place in a long list of similar works, all
aimed at understanding American entrepreneurs, considered a
curious, even mysterious breed by scholars, and just common-sense
folks by themselves.
   In earlier analyses, the entrepreneur was found, among other
things, to have who moved to _ rather than being born in _ the area
of success, to have delivered newspapers, been a so-so student and
to have experienced need.
   Whether such findings are sound or have significance is another
matter, but the latest, by the National Federation of Independent
Business and American Express, has the ring of truth.
   It did turn up at least one finding not revealed by the many
earlier studies, that long hours on the job do indeed make a
positive difference, but that extreme hours apparently erode
entrepreneurial effectiveness.
   ``Long, but not excessive hours, make a difference,'' according
to the Federation, which claims membership of more than 570,000
small and independent business in all 50 states.
   ``Small Business'' is a poorly defined category, sometimes used
to include all companies not among the top 1,000 in gross income,
but the Federation's membership ranges all the way down to sole
proprietorships.
   Its research arm found that 80 percent of those who worked
between 60 hours and 69 hours a week remained in business after the
first three years, a period in which many startup companies fail.
   However, the survival rate of those who worked more than 69
hours a week actually dropped to 75 percent, while those who worked
fewer hours fell to 76 percent.
   While the federation didn't say so, fatigue could be a critical
factor in the effectiveness decline, because more than 69 hours is
double that of many wage-earners and translates into 10 hours a day
seven days a week.
   Of the companies studied, more than three-quarters succeeded.
The owner's average age was 35 years, with a working spouse and no
more than five previous jobs. Of these successes, 90 percent said
they would do it again.
   Based on their experiences, it was determined that quality
service is more important than low price, that success is enhanced
by positive attitudes, and that it is important to have had prior
experience with the product involved.
   The importance of service over price was pronounced. Those whose
companies emphasized better service showed an 82 percent success
rate, compared with those who adopted a low-price strategy.
   As expected, the quality of financing played a big role in the
success or failure of the companies involved. Too little capital
shows up in almost every survey of small-business failure, and this
one was no exception.
   What motivated the entrepreneurs? More than three-quarters
agreed that it was to have greater control over their lives,
closely followed by ``using my skills and abilities,'' and
``building something for my family.''
   Less than half agreed with the statement ``earning lots of
money.'' That kind of reward, Mr. Alger might have suggested, is
simply the just recognition of ambitious, hard-working people who
seek to serve.

<HEAD>Billy Crystal Takes New Act to Old Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last April, Billy Crystal tries a few jokes on a
small audience. Bomb City.
   Uh-oh, he thinks, I need to see what works, ``but where am I
going to break in? At Catch a Rising Czar? At the Impravda?'' He
thinks this way because he is in the Soviet Union at the time. A
rough place for an American comic to break in a new act.
   But anyone who survives ``Saturday Night Live,'' ``Soap'' and
publicity tours for ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' is clearly of
sturdy stuff. Crystal returns to Mother Russia in August. It
results in a 90-minute show.
   Called ``Billy Crystal _ Midnight Train to Moscow,'' it's
getting five Home Box Office cable showings that start Saturday.
It's a mix of comic fantasy, a bit of jazz and a tracing of roots.
   In addition to teaching one Moscow audience how to do The Wave,
he does a short, but memorable skit as Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and maverick Soviet politician Boris Yeltsin in a fierce
argument.
   Instead of mimicking their voices himself, he does it with
big-band jazz riffs on old Maynard Ferguson recording, ``Got the
Spirit.''
   ``They went nuts with that because it was so timely,'' said
Crystal, who also in the show plays a jazzman, Lester Hawkins, a
combination of several famous musicians he actually knew as a kid.
   His knowledge of jazz and decision to attempt a comedy show in
the Soviet Union, despite initial worries, may stem from several
factors.
   One of his grandmothers came from the Soviet Union. He also is
the nephew of a man who founded Commodore Records, a label devoted
to Dixieland. His father used to produce jazz concerts.
   As a kid in New York, he learned the rudiments of clarinet from
a jazz great, Pee Wee Russell. He met Billie Holliday when he was
5, grew up around jazz folk, all friends of his father and uncle.
   ``Those musicians made me want to be a performer,'' said
Crystal, now 41. ``The house was always full of them, always
smelled of bourbon and brisket.''
   He achieved his boyhood goal. But when it came time to visit the
land of his relatives, to perform there, he wanted first to case
the place, try a few things there. His first trip left him
discouraged. The reason?
   ``Well, there's no sense of humor there that makes any sense to
me. To my kind of comedy. What I like to do. I'm talking about live
on the stage. How would that work?''
   He kicked ideas back and forth with Paul Flaherty, who
eventually directed his show. Finally, Crystal said, he hit on a
comedy-fantasy concept ``and started really tracing my roots back,
found how deep they went.
   ``And then the show became more than a comedy show.''
   Early in the program, he does a stand-up routine on a Moscow
stage, in front of an audience, many of whom obviously appear to
understand English. But he opens by speaking fluent-sounding
Russian.
   Although he has the ear of a good mimic, he doesn't know the
language, he said.
   ``I had a good coach,'' he explained. But he admitted he found
Russian ``a tough language. There's a lot of coughing and spitting
...''
   Still, he said, ``I wanted to come out speaking Russian, and not
slow and loud the way people do with foreigners. I wanted the
people to know my roots are there.''
   Although his two Soviet trips were for the purpose of a show
that hopes to make people laugh, Crystal found what he saw of the
Soviet Union a little sad, a little unsettling, despite many
reports of change for the better there.
   ``There's a joke in the show that the place is so gray that Ted
Turner should buy it and colorize it,'' he said. ``You feel that
there. There are some beautiful things to see.
   ``But there's an eeriness ... that there's a sadness among the
people. You just feel it, this fog that is around everybody.''

   Blues singer Big Joe Williams was
fresh out of jail when he cut his first album for Arhoolie Records
one October day in 1960.
   It was one of the most emotional blues sessions Chris Strachwitz
has ever recorded.
   ``He was just fierce,'' the Arhoolie owner recalled. ``He had
jail on his mind, and everything was going bad. I mean that's the
blues. That's pure blues.''
   For more than three decades, the German-born Strachwitz has
wandered the United States holding scores of impromptu recording
sessions, capturing some of the greatest blues, Cajun and
Mexican-American musicians _ as well as many obscure artists _ for
his Arhoolie Records label.
   ``I don't think these people today with 10 million tracks could
have done a ... thing more than what I did with a (Capps) condenser
microphone,'' Strachwitz said. ``But of course, these were all
acoustic instruments.''
   Record collectors know his Down Home Music store, which shares a
building in El Cerrito, about 20 miles east of San Francisco, with
Arhoolie.
   The place is a record mecca for fans of folk, blues, country and
world music. But unlike the big retailers, tapes and compact discs
still represent the minority of sales. Down Home ships albums
nationwide through detailed mail-order catalogs that feature
reviews _ some good, some bad _ for the records it carries.
   Strachwitz also has produced and co-directed films about music
with director Les Blanc, whose studio is adjacent to Arhoolie, and
he is working on a book about Lydia Mendoza, the famous
Mexican-American singer.
   But Strachwitz doesn't spend much time in the record store. He
bought the building more than 20 years ago with proceeds from rock
band Country Joe and the Fish's hit ``I'm Fixin' to Die Rag,'' to
which he held the publishing rights.
   The one-time high school German teacher and avid record
collector _ he has at least 22,000 records stashed in something
called ``the vault'' _ now faces the task of putting more than a
hundred recordings made over 30 years, plus scores of others he's
released, onto compact disc.
   All for a business he says has never been very profitable.
   ``I never went at it as a business. That's where I'm somewhat
different than most,'' Strachwitz said in an interview. ``I never
thought about merchandising or that this stuff was a product. I
began to realize this country was constituted of all kinds of
people from all kinds of backgrounds.''
   In the late 1950s, he saved money he made teaching and headed
east one summer to Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. He recorded a
handful of performers, then returned to California and formed a
record label.
   ``I learned to splice 12 songs together, two sides of a record,
roughly 20 minutes a side,'' he said. ``Then I sent that to a guy
who cut an acetate master. From that the plates were made. And then
they started pressing the plates. Then you made the jacket.''
   He found musicians on street corners, bars and fields.
   Artists such as Mississippi Fred McDowell, Big Mama Thornton,
Earl Hooker, Clifton Chenier and Michael Ducet owe at least part of
their status to Strachwitz.
   He found Arhoolie's first artist, Mance Lipscomb, while driving
near Houston. Another, Black Ace, he found by asking locals whether
they knew of any good guitar pickers.
   ``I'd stop on street corners. There'd be guys playing dice and
I'd walk up and ask them, `You guys ever heard of a guy named
Little Brother?' They'd usually just stare at you and say, `What
you want with him?' They figure you're a bill collector or
something.
   ``So this one guy said, `Yeah, he's hangin' around with Black
Ace.' That name was on my list that Paul Oliver, a blues fanatic
friend, had sent me. They said he comes to this tavern right around
the corner every afternoon about 5 o'clock.
   ``That's how I met Black Ace. That was another record.''
   Strachwitz traces his love of blues to his boyhood in Los
Angeles, where he first idolized bluesman Lightning Hopkins after
hearing his single ``Hello Central'' on radio station KFVD.
   In 1959, he visited Hopkins for the first time in Houston, and a
year later he returned, hoping to record Hopkins' music.
   ``At that time I decided I wanted to make a record label because
I wanted to document Lightning Hopkins in the beer joints, the way
he sounded. I was never able to do that. I didn't have the
technical equipment. I didn't have the money.''
   He got his chance later in his career when he took Hopkins into
a recording studio.
   By the time Strachwitz made his first recording, he had teamed
with fellow blues fanatic Mack McCormick, a ``playwrite-cab
driver'' from Houston. After asking around, the two found bluesman
Lipscomb at his home in Navasota, Texas.
   ``We just turned the machine on and he played one song after the
other. They usually give you their best,'' Strachwitz said. ``It
was just a little shotgun house, with his wife and a number of
grandchildren.''
   In 1963, Hopkins introduced Strachwitz to Clifton Chenier, who
was playing little bars in Houston's French section.
   ``I always tried to get him to play his French music, but he
always wanted to play rock 'n' roll.''
   Chenier, one of Arhoolie's best-selling artists, died in 1987.
   Over the years, Strachwitz has improved his equipment, but he
still prefers taping acoustic instruments with simple recording
devices. More and more, he is forced to take bands into the studio
to cut albums.
   His current best seller is the Cajun band Beausoleil, featuring
fiddler Michael Ducet. Strachwitz said Ducet has much of the
spontaneity and character of the singers he found in remote areas
during the 1960s.

<HEAD>Anthologist Hopes for a Weapon Too Big To Throw</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Books as well as rocks and guns have long been
weapons in the feuds that have riven Ireland.
   Seamus Deane, nearing the end of his work on one of the biggest
books of all, an anthology of 14 centuries of Irish writing, hopes
it will be simply too large and too inclusive to hurl at an enemy.
   Deane, a professor of English and American literature at
University College Dublin, is general editor of ``The Field Day
Anthology of Irish Writing, 550-1990,'' to be published in April by
Faber &amp; Faber.
   In two volumes and 3,000 pages, the anthology will include
examples of writing in early, medieval and modern Irish, Norman
French, Latin and English.
   Deane stresses ``writing'' in the title because he has included
magazine and newspaper articles, oral histories, attempts at
literature that could hardly be called great and commentaries about
Ireland by English notables including Oliver Cromwell, who led a
bloody military expedition through Ireland.
   ``This immense and distressing work,'' as Deane calls it, is
inevitably a political document, an argument against anyone _
republican, loyalist, Protestant, Catholic, Celt, Gael,
Scots-Irish, Anglo-Irish _ who would stake an exclusive claim to
being Irish.
   ``We are not trying to say, in fact we are refusing to say, that
there is some metaphysical essence called `Irishness' that is as
visible in a 9th century poem as it is in a play by Sean O'Casey.
We're not interested in that, because we don't believe in the
existence of it,'' said Deane, a native of Londonderry in the
British province of Northern Ireland, during a recent visit to
London.
   ``The anthology is a serious attempt to try to introduce to
people the idea of a culture that was so rich and diverse that it
cannot be appropriated by any one group.''
   The anthology was sponsored by Field Day, founded in Londonderry
in 1980 by playwright Brian Friel and actor Stephen Rea as a
traveling theater company. It expanded into publishing in 1983 with
a series of political pamphlets, and is widely regarded as the
finest cultural response Northern Ireland has produced against the
violence that has torn the province.
   Deane described the anthology as a definition of Irish writing;
of repossession of Irish-born authors such George Bernard Shaw,
Oscar Wilde, Jonathan Swift, Edmund Burke and Laurence Sterne who
are prominent in English letters; and of decolonization.
   ``It is important that this should be an exemplary act of
showing how you can retain cultural intimacy and links with the
colonizing power while at the same time not learning to think of
yourself as having an ancillary, marginal or junior role to that
power,'' Deane said.
   However, he also detects in Ireland a tendency to fall into a
trap of colonial self-image: ``They don't know where they are or
where they came from, and they invent fake origins that exclude
many people whom they have to live with.''
   Ultimately, he argued, this process of inventing origins and
excluding late-comers makes the ``others'' less human, and thus
suitable targets for murder.
   The anthology is intended, Deane said, to ``provide material
that will show the stupidity and the brokenhearted terminus to
which sectarianism leads, and how sectarianism can only be
justified by a certain kind of deliberate, fostered, nurtured
ignorance of what in fact has happened, what contributions have
been made by various groups over the centuries to the culture.''
   One section will be devoted to Protestant political oratory in
the north in the 19th and 20th centuries. It will also take note of
an Ulster Protestant literary tradition _ ``a literature, alas,
that is not known to many Protestants.''
   One important figure in that tradition is Sir Samuel Ferguson of
Belfast, ``one of the first to try to combine in his writings a
plea for Irish cultural unity which at the same time would allow
maintenance of the political union with Britain.''
   Deane believes the anthology will demonstrate that the Republic
of Ireland does not have a culture distinct from that of Northern
Ireland, and he sees that as a rebuke to southern provincialism.
   ``There is a section called `Provincialism and Censorship,'
centering in the 1930s and 1940s, and is about those writers such
as (Samuel) Beckett, Sean O'Faolain, Frank O'Connor, Flann O'Brien,
Denis Devlin, who in a sense find that the atmosphere in the south
was suffocating,'' he said.
   ``They shut the doors on the minds in the south, they exported
the young people and by the 1950s it had become a kind of
semi-geriatric society with most of its young energy drained away
and the Catholic church ruling the roost, and the intellectual life
in a dreadful state of disrepair.''

<TEXT>
   A great blue heron, its craned neck
and long bill poking through the morning mist, feeds along the
wooded shore of a strip-mine lake.
   Not far away are watchers armed with binoculars, cameras and
video cameras. But it's not the heron they're watching _ it's
dozens of out-of-state trash trucks rumbling up to the Center Point
Landfill, feeding the earth-movers whose drone shatters the idyll a
half-mile from the lake.
   The ``dump patrol'' _ including teachers, miners, teen-agers and
retirees _ was organized by Terri Moore, whose dream of a quiet,
rural life also has been shattered, by fears of a mountain of
garbage imported from the East Coast.
   ``Until the out-of-state waste stops, we're going to be out
here,'' said Moore, 33, whose troops have logged nearly 1,200 rigs
from 140 companies in the 11 weeks since they started keeping track.
   The landfill operators have called it harassment. ``I have a
substantial investment in the landfill. I'm not going to be doing
anything to jeopardize that,'' said John R. Hoffman, a New
Jersey-based businessman who is a partner in the Center Point
landfill and others near Peru and Wabash.
   But Moore said that if a cleanup is ever needed, officials will
have names they need by tracing license plates and companies logged
by the dump patrol.
   John and Terri Moore and their family moved into their home on
25 acres outside this western Indiana town 2{ years ago. The
lifelong area residents wanted their children to grow up here, too,
near the five-acre lake on their land that attracts the herons,
geese and other wildlife.
   ``It was our dream house. We knew in life we couldn't ask for
anything more. It was like having a vacation every night,'' Terri
said.
   Then last year, John came home from work one day and said
developers proposed a landfill on the property adjacent to theirs,
a few hundred feet from their lake, across the road from Center
Point Landfill.
   Moore feared toxins would leak through abandoned mine shafts to
their lake and property. Last October, she formed HOPE, Hoosiers
Opposing Pollution of the Environment, and tried to reach all of
approximately 750 people who live within two miles of the dump. She
figures 60 percent of the families now are members.
   ``I got people upset. I got people concerned and worried.'' She
also got them to have local land-zoning changes approved that
stopped that landfill.
   It proved to be an empty victory.
   Last November, Center Point Landfill got a state permit to
accept asbestos, which causes cancer and is being removed from
buildings across the country. It also began accepting limited
shipments of trash from out of state. East Coast landfill space is
dwindling and communities must ship refuse elsewhere.
   The landfill's neighbors objected.
   Robert Bedwell Jr., whose family owned the site, said some
people called state officials to report suspected but unfounded
infractions. He began talks with a group headed by Hoffman, and a
sale was completed in July.
   Since then, trucks carrying out-of-state trash have rolled into
Center Point. Some days, as many as 30 trucks queue up at the dump,
motoring to the top of a hill and unloading refuse that bulldozers
cover with dirt.
   ``We knew the landfill was sold, and then one morning we saw 30
or 40 trucks were going by. That kind of made all of our nightmares
come true,'' said Terri Moore.
   ``I don't see how our state officials can have this go on,''
said patrol member Forest Reece, a 78-year-old retired custodian
and factory worker. ``My God, I think it's horrible myself.''
   Indiana apparently can do little. Federal laws forbid one state
from refusing to accept trash from another state. The Solid Waste
Management Board has given preliminary approval to a plan to track
the amount and origin of the trash, but it faces public hearings
and other steps before it goes into effect.
   Bedwell, 37, began taking out-of-state garbage a year ago out of
fear that if a new landfill opened across the road it would steal
his business. He began taking asbestos because it was an
opportunity for the family business to grow.
   ``I didn't take anything hazardous,'' he said, adding that his
asbestos operation met the highest state and federal requirements.
Bedwell said he tried to talk to members of HOPE and show them how
the landfill operated, but, ``They didn't want to see. They wanted
to stand by the road and imagine it.
   ``I went to school with these people. Now they won't even talk
to me. These people used to be my friends. It hurts. It hurts real
bad.''
   Neither Bedwell nor Hoffman would say how much was paid for the
landfill, but legal papers show Hoffman's group came up with an
initial $2.7 million.
   Hoffman, a 13-year veteran of landfill operations, said that
without the out-of-state business, his landfills would be barely
getting by. He said half the refuse accepted at Center Point comes
from out of state.
   ``This is a privately owned business. We have space to sell,''
he said. ``To run a good operation, you need income.''
   The landfill employs 12 people with an annual payroll of
$350,000. It will pump about $1 million into the local economy over
the next 12 months, he said. ``I think that's a very good
neighbor.''
   Hoffman also said the landfill was safe and, like his operations
near Wabash and Peru, refuses waste it is not permitted to accept.
``That particular landfill is probably the best geologically sited
in the state of Indiana.''
   HOPE's fears about the asbestos are unfounded, he said. While it
is dangerous in the air, he said, it ``has zero chance of getting
into the groundwater. It is not mobile in soil.''
   Hoffman acknowledged that HOPE's presence will probably help him
run the landfill better. He has tried to work with the group and
called Moore shortly after he took over, but she wasn't interested
in seeing the operation.
   Now, Hoffman said, he has no more time for Moore or HOPE. ``You
cannot deal with these people rationally. I can't be distracted by
them. They're interested in closing the landfill, true and simple.''
   Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., says he will
use the photographs taken by Moore and her patrol to convince
Congress that it needs to ban the practice of transporting trash
and food in the same trucks.
   Smith plans to introduce legislation to bar refrigerated trucks
from hauling landfill waste, ban waste transporters from hauling
food, and require landfill operators to have truck-cleaning
procedures. Moore sent him pictures of refrigerated trucks
unloading garbage at the landfill during the summer.
   ``Four different truckers told us they hauled beef on hanging
meat racks from Chicago to the East Coast after making trash
runs,'' she said. ``One thing that really upset us was when
truckers showed us live maggots in the back of non-refrigerated
trucks that had gone through the landfill's washing procedure.''

<HEAD>Suburu Legacy: Roomy Wagon With Spaciousness, Easy Handling</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Beware of the 1990 Subaru Legacy LS AWD wagon. It could make you
forget all about buying a minivan.
   I know. Minivans are the hot ticket. Station wagons are supposed
to be passe.
   But compact sedans also are popular, a la the Toyota Camry and
Honda Accord, and Subaru's Legacy wagon feels just like a sedan
with the utility of a little van.
   The Legacy LS all-wheel-drive test wagon drove like a sedan,
handling well and accelerating with steady power.
   It seated five with relative ease, just like a decent-sized
sedan would, and there was no stepping up to get inside.
   And the Legacy had 71 cubic feet of cargo space in back, with
the split rear seats folded down. That's more than the 62.7 cubic
feet you get by removing the rear-most seats of General Motors' new
minivans, though not as much as the 111.2 cubic feet you get in
those vans if you take out both sets of rear seats.
   Still, the Legacy also had full-time four-wheel-drive, an
alternative not yet offered on the GM minivans or even Chrysler's
popular minivans.
   And the Legacy test car came standard with a 2.2-liter engine
that was powerful and yet had only four cylinders, with four valves
per cylinder and multi-port fuel injection, rather than the
six-cylinder engines sometimes needed to adequately power minivans.
No wonder that Subaru nicknamed its engine the ``Boxer.'' It pulls
no punches, just delivers the power, eagerly, when teamed with
five-speed manual transmission.
   And it delivered decent fuel economy while powering all four
wheels: 20 miles to the gallon in the city and 26 mpg on the
highway. Even the automatic transmission gets 20 mpg in the city
and 25 mpg on the highway in the four-wheel-drive model, according
to the EPA. That compares with 18 mpg and 22 mpg, respectively, for
the all-wheel-drive Nissan Axxess with four-cylinder engine and
automatic transmission.
   Subaru also was attentive to inside details. The Legacy wagon
has a nifty two-cup holder that pulls out of the dash below the
ventilation controls.
   It places cups high enough to be easily reached while driving.
Make sure the radio is tuned beforehand, however. It's tough to
make adjustments with the cups in the way.
   A shelf below the ashtray had rubber material that gripped
whatever was placed there, so keys, tickets and change didn't slide
off.
   Dashboard gauges had large, easy-to-read numbers and included a
tachometer. Front-seat headrests could be adjusted for height as
well as how close they were positioned to an occupant's head. The
LS model came with a sunroof and cruise control for added comfort.
   In the cargo area, Subaru installed a big plastic tray under the
thick cargo rug for tools or small items. A stalk was provided to
prop the cargo rug up out of the way as you reached for the spare
tire. Replacing the rug was a snap _ literally. Easy snaps hold the
cargo covering snugly in place.
   But be wary of the top tailgate; on the test car, it tended to
bounce up quickly and could have hit an unwary bystander.
   But the real news was passenger space. This is Subaru's largest
car ever, the first with a wheelbase of more than 100 inches.
   The space was used well, with plenty of room front and back.
Legroom was terrific with the front seats moved up, and even when
the front seats were all the way back and slightly reclined, my
knees cleared the seatbacks.
   Seating for two was more than adequate in the rear, and three
would be snug only if everyone was overweight. But even the person
sitting in the middle would appreciate the Legacy design. There was
no bump or hard middle in the back seat, just cushioned comfort
throughout.
   Subaru says Legacy buyers are expected to be married, 25-49
years old, with household income of $40,000 or more.
   About 60 percent will be male, and they will have some college
education.
   The company did not have sales projections but has sold more
than 6,000 wagons since the Legacy appeared in showrooms in May.
   Because the Legacy is new, Consumer Reports does not have owner
complaints.
   One final note: The Legacy is the first U.S.-built vehicle for
Subaru, with some vehicles coming from a new plant in Lafayette,
Ind.

   Right now, the days and nights of television's
Molly Dodd _ also known as actress Blair Brown _ are spent on a
shabby block of West 47th Street, at Broadway's Ethel Barrymore
Theatre.
   She's starring in ``The Secret Rapture,'' a new play by British
playwright David Hare, her boyfriend. The drama was written
specifically for Brown _ ``For Blair, as ever,'' says Hare's
dedication _ and she plays one of its three choice female roles.
   It tells of two sisters (Brown and Frances Conroy) who return
home after the death of their father and who must deal with their
lives as well as the life of their alcoholic stepmother (Mary Beth
Hurt). Marion, played by Conroy, is an ambitious junior minister in
the Thatcher government, and Isobel, the role played by Brown, is
an ineffectual but well-intentioned graphic designer.
   ``The Secret Rapture'' was a big hit at England's National
Theatre where it was performed by a different cast and with a
different director. Hare does the honors here.
   ``What's hard for some people about David's plays is that they
are not manuals about how to live,'' Brown says. ``Everyone in
them, not unlike life, is a mixture of good and bad, strengths and
weaknesses. And that's sometimes difficult for mass American
audiences to accept.''
   She's confident that New York theatergoers won't have trouble
relating to very English characters and will have an easier time
picking up on the family drama than the British politics.
   ``So many of the characters sound very American, like Marion,
who is a real achiever, or her husband Tom, a Christian
businessman,'' Brown says. ``I thought the United States had the
corner on that profession and that they were all Southern.''
   Whether ``The Secret Rapture'' will succeed on Broadway, Brown
doesn't know, but she has an affection for the character she plays.
   ``Isobel is a woman sensitive to a certain kind of emotional
blackmail, probably a person who's living her life according to the
path of least resistance,'' the actress says. ``She is not a
victim. She hangs on to her own integrity but, to a fault, Isobel
is a good daughter.''
   Not unlike the slightly bewildered woman Brown plays on the
television series ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' now seen
on Lifetime, a cable channel.
   ``Molly Dodd's'' history is worthy of soap opera, if not sitcom.
   It began more than two years ago with producer Jay Tarses, for
whom Brown had done a television pilot that ABC decided not to pick
up. They had gotten along immediately.
   ``We had the same sense of humor _ he was so twisted,'' Brown
laughs.
   ``Then Brandon Tartikoff of NBC called Jay and without ever
mentioning the `Mary' word, said he wanted to do a series about a
single woman in the big city,'' she recalls.
   What Tarses came up with was ``Molly Dodd,'' which premiered on
NBC during the summer of 1987. Despite cheers from the critics, it
never lived up to the network's expectations. What NBC got was an
unusual comedy in which Molly struggled to cope with her mother,
ex-husband, sister, various boyfriends and life. Some of the time,
she didn't succeed.
   The show, moved from time slot to time slot, eventually was cast
off by NBC and picked up by Lifetime. And instead of being filmed
in Los Angeles, ``Molly Dodd'' is now done in New York, where its
production team can take advantage of the city's theater people.
   ``The pool of actors here is much grittier, much more
interesting,'' Brown says. ``Now we have a little theatrical rep
company.''
   Most of the show's scripts are written by playwright Eric
Overmyer, author of ``On the Verge,'' and directed by Don Scardino,
a veteran theater performer who will direct the play ``A Few Good
Men'' on Broadway later this season.
   Everyone took a salary cut when the show moved to cable because
the licensing fees are less.
   ``But it was worth it,'' Brown says. ``What's your choice? Not
to do it because you are going to make more money doing something
you don't like?''
   The size of the audience on cable is smaller, too _ ``We were
worried viewers wouldn't be able to find us'' _ but people still
recognize Brown on the street.
   ``It's nice, but then Molly is kind of a benevolent personality.
It's not like Judy Carne's `sock-it-to-me' girl on `Laugh In.' They
don't want to see how tough I am. They basically think I'm their
neighbor.''
   And most don't think of her as a theater actress. Audiences
don't realize that before there was ``The Days and Nights of Molly
Dodd'' or movies like ``Continental Divide'' with John Belushi or
TV miniseries like ``Kennedy'' and ``Captains and the Kings,''
there was the stage.
   Brown, a native of Washington, D.C., has extensive and
impressive credits, starting with her training at the National
Theatre of Canada. She ended up working at the Shakespeare Festival
in Stratford, Ontario, and in regional theaters across Canada and
the United States, including two seasons at the Guthrie in
Minneapolis.
   ``I was an ingenue, so I could always get work because I looked
the right way,'' she says.
   ``A couple years ago I was going in for an audition and I could
see this director thinking, `Oh, this is a television actress, I'm
going to cross over,''' she says. ``I wanted to take him by the
throat and yell, `Look at my credits.'''
   Brown was given six months off from ``Molly Dodd'' to do ``The
Secret Rapture.'' If it runs long enough, she'll leave the play
next February to resume production of the television series.
   ``It's very rare to have this much good material to do _
especially material that is written for you,'' Brown says. ``So
it's just bad sportsmanship to complain. Just keep your mouth shut
and count your lucky stars because it will soon be over.''

   Donald Petersen says the worst day in his
40 years with Ford Motor Co. came shortly after he was named
president in March 1980, when he realized the No. 2 automaker was
in worse shape than he'd thought.
   ``It was certainly a sobering day,'' he said. ``It was probably
the most sobering day.''
   The company had just reported a profit of $1.17 billion for
1979, the second straight year that profits were down. Ford's
financial slide was accelerating, hurt by rising gasoline prices
and rising interest rates, which were making cars less affordable.
   By the time Petersen's first year as Ford's president ended, the
company had reported a $1.54 billion loss. To the outside world,
things looked pretty bad.
   But sequestered from public view in Ford design studios were the
cars that would help resurrect the company and make it one of the
world's most profitable corporations in less than a decade.
   First the sleek Thunderbird and later the jelly-bean-like Taurus
and Sable models became the weapons Ford used to slam-dunk its way
back into the brutally competitive auto business, threatening No. 1
General Motors Corp.'s dominance.
   ``What was so striking to me about the Taurus was that it put
the stamp of certified acceptance and rightness on the efforts of
Ford Motor Company in a fashion that I did not anticipate fully,''
Petersen said. ``To me, we had started the process long before.
   ``I thought of the '83 Thunderbird as really, if you will, the
benchmark car that really declared that there was going to be a
very different direction, specifically in design of automobiles.''
   Petersen was no stranger to watching cars develop from a sketch
sheet to the assembly line.
   Through the 1950s and 1960s, he rose through the product
planning division to become vice president for car planning and
research in 1969. In the early 1970s, he was vice president and
general manager of the company's truck operations, giving him broad
product experience.
   Between then and the time he was elected to Ford's board of
directors on Sept. 8, 1977, Petersen was executive vice president
for diversified products, which linked the company with suppliers
and subsidiaries, and was vice president for international
operations.
   Some analysts have said his role overseeing foreign operations
gave him a view of the international automobile industry that has
spurred Ford to break out of the Big Three carmaking mold.
   The introductions of the Taurus and Sable _ on the day after
Christmas 1985 proved to be the gift that has kept on giving for
Ford.
   By then, the company was well into a painful cost-reduction
program that scrapped the paring knife and instead used a cleaver
to eliminate what Petersen and his colleagues considered excessive
and redundant. At the same time, gasoline prices and interest rates
were falling.
   ``I think it was all of this coming together in that type of car
that created almost a sensation that I didn't expect,'' Petersen
said.
   Earlier that year, Petersen became board chairman and chief
executive officer. In 1985, Ford made $2.52 billion.
   Ford has been on a roll since the Taurus-Sable introduction,
stealing sales and market share from GM, fighting off foreign
competition easier than other domestic manufacturers and keeping a
lid on manufacturing expansion through the use of overtime instead
of expensive new factories.
   One of the big problems for automakers in the 1990s promises to
be overcapacity _ too many assembly lines producing too many cars
for a saturated market. It likely will affect Ford less than others.
   ``If the scenario is roughly what we think it will be _ slow
growth, an industry down some, perhaps, from this year _ Ford
should be in a pretty good position to deal with most of the
problems by fluctuating overtime,'' Petersen said.
   It is that outlook of soft growth that has pushed Ford into
other directions under Petersen's guidance.
   For example, the automaker has expressed interest in buying all
or part of such well-known European automakers as Britain's Jaguar
and Sweden's Saab to strengthen its worldwide operations.
   Ford also has made major moves into financial services to
cushion the blow of any auto-industry downturn. Last July, for
instance, it announced the $3.35 billion purchase of The
Associates, a major provider of consumer financing, from Paramount
Communications Corp.
   Petersen is making no predictions about the level of car and
truck sales in 1990. ``We want to see a little bit more of the
fourth quarter (of 1989) before we start quantifying next year,''
he said.
   ``We do think that it's likely to be off some from the 1989
calendar year, but not a dramatic drop.'' In fact, he added, Ford's
sales should continue to grow, which would give it a larger share
of a smaller market.
   Petersen said much of the reason for Ford's comeback stems from
a management meeting in 1984 when the company's leadership adopted
``Company Mission, Values and Guiding Principles'' _ a statement of
Ford's goals.
   ``I'll always remember Henry Ford II devoting his entire talk to
the then new statement of MVGP at Ford,'' Petersen said. ``As he
left the podium, he said to me, `Pete, I hope I gave your new
statement of what we want to be a good send off.'
   ``That really was a certification that we really are going to
change. At that point, we were very much in the process of change.''
   Under Petersen's direction, the company became the most
profitable automaker in history. In 1986, Ford made $3.29 billion,
raised that to $4.63 billion in 1987 and set an industry record
$5.3 billion in profit in 1988.
   Honors have been heaped on Petersen for work in and out of the
automobile industry. Yet his office has none of the numerous
plaques he has received over the years. In fact, there is little
indication, save a life-size bust of the Greek god Mercury by
Marshall Fredericks, that it's the seat of management for Ford
Motor Co.
   In the place of plaques, certificates and official proclamations
are things near and dear to Petersen and his wife, Jody.
   Rocks.
   Not just any rocks, but minerals collected from all over the
world.
   A case contains raw and finished forms of dozens of minerals _
an emerald from Muzo, Colombia, cinnabar from China's Hunan
Province and imperial topaz from Minas Gerais, Brazil.
   In a private meeting room as a centerpiece on a small table,
there is an unusually large specimen of twinned quartz.
   ``My interest is what's beautiful and what's pretty,'' Petersen
said. ``And then you go on to see if it's perfect.''

   Bunting poses another scenario:
   ``All right,'' he says. ``It's 102 degrees out, you're in the
South Bronx and you've got 300 people around you now. What are you
charging this guy with?''
   A Hispanic cop, getting into the spirit, jumps up and confronts
her classmate.
   ``What are you doing? That's my brother. He didn't do nothing.''
   The laughter drowns out Bunting.
   Bunting once gave a lecture to a group of mystery book writers
and was deluged with offers to co-author a book.
   Dr. Alan Goldstein, a psychology professor, says he was once
teaching a class about schizophrenics and their usual non-violent
nature.
   A cop-student asked: ``Would you like me to show the class the
two bullet holes I have in my buttocks from one of those
non-violent schizophrenics?''
   Goldstein says that is one of the great strengths of John Jay.
   ``We all learn to be tolerant and we learn from each other.''
   Meanwhile, back in the ivory tower part of the school, freshmen
are wrestling with an English literature survey course, basic
mathematics, speech, government 101, much like students at any
college. Half of their credits must be in traditional liberal arts
courses, but even those have a criminal justice flavor.
   ``Sometimes, we wish their interests were broader,'' says Dr.
Dorothy Bracey, head of the anthropology department and an expert
on international policing, particularly the criminal justice system
in China. ``But, in another way, it makes it easier to teach here.
In theory, all students have some interest in criminal justice.''
   Forty percent of Jay's students come from families that earn
under $12,000 a year. They are older than most college students and
most of them work. About 80 percent receive some sort of financial
aid.
   The undergraduates are 36 percent black, 32 percent white, 28
percent Hispanic. Almost half are women.
   Due to finances, about a fourth graduate in four years. With
work and aid, almost three-fourths stick out 10 to 14 semesters to
graduate.
   Still, about 500 students get their baccalaureates each year.
   The staff includes Olga Ford, a retired New York City detective.
She has worked as technical adviser for TV shows. There was a
reported contract out on her when she helped bring down drug
kingpin Nicky Barnes.
   As head of the internship program and knowing the reality of
policing, she advises students: Don't take internships with private
industry security men who are armed, never ride in a radio car,
never visit a parolee, never walk with a cop to and from the
precinct.
   There's Dr. Ansley Hamid, an anthropology professor who
specializes in crack-related violence and street gangs and
maintains that crack is not as instantly addictive as it is being
portrayed.
   ``The dealers are controlled users, or sometimes abstinent, and
I recently met an 80-year-old grandmother, who has no previous
history of alcohol or drug abuse, who is a controlled user,'' Hamid
says.
   ``Crack just came on us so fast, there was no time for a body of
experiential users to teach others. Now people are coming up with
strategies for recreational use of crack. They might mix a little
with some marijuana, for instance.''
   Is this a rather benign view of crack?
   ``Not benign,'' says Hamid, ``just a business-as-usual view of
underground economies.
   ``The real danger is the destruction of families and crack does
the footwork. The marijuana dealer lasted a long time. Eventually
he bought a small bakery or maybe a boutique in the neighborhood.
With crack, the money doesn't stay here.
   ``The crack dealer doesn't last long. He is either arrested,
killed by the competition or he becomes a crack head himself. But
when he has the money, he conspicuously consumes, buying fancy
imported cars and jewelry. The money doesn't go back into the
community that generated it.''
   Over at the Criminal Justice Center, there is William McCarthy,
retired New York City detective. With the code name ``Mother,'' he
was once the undercover owner of two houses of prostitution. As
head of the bomb squad when he retired, he was known as ``Billy
Bombs.''
   Now working on his doctorate, McCarthy says: ``If it weren't for
John Jay, I would never have gotten my bachelor's and master's
degrees. Back then, it was the only place a cop could go.''
   In the next office sits William Louden, also working on his
doctorate. Louden was the NYPD's chief hostage negotiator.
   Psychology professor Charles Bahn likes to tell about the FBI
man in a public service administration course. The professor
lectured that changes in top leadership should occur at least every
10 years. Loyal to long-tenured J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI man
challenged that. So the professor assigned him to write a paper
justifying his point of view.
   Working at his office, the FBI man did some research on the pros
and cons of Hoover's long stewardship, pitching the carbons into
the waste basket where another agent found them. The FBI-author
agent was greeted the next morning by two FBI agents who announced
he was under investigation.
   He explained to the department that this was not a plot. It was
homework.
   An angry Hoover was on the telephone immediately to John Jay:
``What are you going to do about that professor who is trying to
undermine me?''
   ``I'll tell him you called,'' was the reply of a school that
will not suffer intimidation.

<HEAD>Mel Harris Stars as Victim of Klan Leader</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The handsome, charismatic grand dragon of the
Ku Klux Klan was destined for political control of Indiana until a
young schoolteacher looked beneath his sheet.
   It had, in a sense, fatal consequences for both. It led to her
kidnaping and rape; in her humiliation she took her own life. It
sent him to prison amidst revelations of corruption and criminal
activities behind the facade of a benevolent KKK that brought his
empire crashing down.
   NBC retells the story in the miniseries ``Cross of Fire.''
   Mel Harris stars as Madge Oberholtzer, a teacher working for the
Department of Education, and John Heard is David Stephenson, the
Klansman, in this drama based upon a true story of events in
Indiana in the 1920s. At that time, the KKK was a major political
force in a number of states.
   ``Cross of Fire,'' which NBC will telecast in two parts on
Sunday and Monday, also stars Lloyd Bridges as the defense attorney
and David Morse as the prosecutor. Paul Wendkos directed on
location in Kansas from a screenplay by Robert Crais.
   ``They meet at a party for state bigwigs,'' said Harris, who
played the role during time off from ABC's ``thirtysomething.''
   ``She sees it as an opportunity to promote her book program. She
meets David and he tells her the Klan does good work and charity.
He says the bad reports are merely being spread by outside
factions. He's very charismatic and she goes for him.''
   Her feelings cause some emotional conflict, yet it's the first
love of her life. She tries to set aside her reservations about the
Klan.
   ``He has his own private party with her,'' Harris said. ``She
goes to his house to talk about her book project. When she resists
his aggression, he kidnaps her, beats her and rapes her.
   ``She wasn't naive. She was very intelligent. She had been taken
in by his charm. There's always the element that love is blind. She
wanted to believe that he was good. She tries to kill herself when
she realizes the situation she's in.''
   Although she died as a result of taking poison, the jury was so
enraged at his conduct that they sent him to prison for life for
murder. Some of his political cronies also went to jail. No
governor dared release him from prison until 1956, after he served
31 years.
   Harris plays Hope Steadman in the Emmy-winning
``thirtysomething.'' She recently co-starred with Jim Belushi in
the feature film ``K-9'' and co-stars with John Ritter in the
upcoming ABC movie ``My Brother's Wife.'' The latter is based on
the play ``The Middle Ages.''
   During an interview, she was in costume for a 1940s fantasy
sequence for ``thirtysomething'': pants, shirt and tie, a bowler on
her head. The studio streets and commissary were filled with extras
in period clothing.
   ``I don't know what's ahead for Hope,'' she said. ``We talked
about her having a second baby. Hope will continue to work and have
a career outside of the house. She's very loving and caring and
friendly, but sometimes she can be a little too much of those
things.
   ``She would make a wonderful best friend. I don't want to be
her, but I would certainly take her as a friend.''
   In the show she's married to Michael, played by Ken Olin.
Michael is Jewish and the interfaith marriage occasionally causes a
few problems. Such as which faith to raise their son in and the
celebration of Christmas.
   ```My Brother's Wife' is a romantic comedy and a nice change of
pace,'' she said. ``I did it after I completed `Cross of Fire.'
It's about a girl who meets two brothers. One's a straight
Republican growing up in his father's mold. The other pushes the
limits, played by John Ritter, of course. David Byron plays the
other brother.
   ``I marry the stuffy brother. Then it's about how I and the
other brother keep crossing paths. I guess they have this love for
each other. She stays faithful to her husband. It's about how
people's lives change over the years.''
   Her first movie was the 1985 TV movie ``Harry's Hong Kong.'' It
was a series pilot in which David Soul was a businessman and she
was a reporter. She moved to Los Angeles with her husband and
newborn son just before the 1984 Summer Olympics. She had been
doing modeling and commercials and studying acting in New York.
   Harris is married to Cotter Smith, who stars in the upcoming ABC
midseason series ``Equal Justice.'' He plays a bureau chief in the
district attorney's office.
   She grew up in New Brunswick, N.J., where her father was
defensive football coach at Princeton University. She was accepted

   She was born Mary Ellen but a younger sister couldn't pronounce
it and called her ``Melon,'' which was later shortened to Mel.

<HEAD>Reagan Trip Gives Rich Meaning to Word `Honorarium'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan is beginning a
week in Japan that gives rich, new meaning to the word
``honorarium.'' Make that very rich.
   Reagan is said to be picking up a fee of $2 million, prompting
complaints in Congress and an inquiry into the government costs for
Secret Service protection during the trip.
   The trip, and the flap, came as Congress completed action on a
bill providing $1.8 million to pay the pensions, office and staff
expenses of the four living former presidents. That does not
include the cost of the Secret Service protection provided to
former presidents and their wives.
   The total cost of that protection is expected to come to $12.5
million this year, for three of the former presidents. Richard M.
Nixon decided in 1985 to give up his Secret Service bodyguards and
pay for his own protection. A spokesman said he now spends about
$150,000 a year on it.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., wants a review of the benefits
bestowed on the men who have served in the White House. He called
it federal largesse intended to avoid commercialization of the
office.
   ``Perhaps there is an equitable middle ground between the Reagan
and Nixon situations regarding public funding of protective
services for former presidents when they are traveling on
profitmaking ventures,'' Pryor said.
   He has arranged to meet with Secret Service officials next week
to talk about the cost of guarding former presidents on trips like
Reagan's.
   Pryor suggested Reagan voluntarily reimburse the Treasury for
Secret Service costs on his trip to Japan. ``I doubt he will do
so,'' Pryor told the Senate. ``If some administrative accommodation
cannot be reached on this matter, I will introduce legislation to
make sure the taxpayer does not get stuck with the bill when our
former presidents are off actually increasing their personal
fortunes.''
   In the House, Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said it is
embarrassing to have a former president picking up big fees from a
foreign corporation, then, warming to his topic, called it an
``unmitigated atrocity'' for the government to pay security costs
on such a trip.
   ``I do think it is reasonable to ask what it is costing American
taxpayers to send a former president of the United States to Japan
so that he may engage in conversations with Japanese corporations
and gain $2 million in personal income for doing that,'' Kanjorski
said Tuesday when the House passed the bill including the
appropriation for former presidents, who receive annual pensions of
$99,500. The Senate completed action on Wednesday, without debate.
   Reagan and his wife were spending the weekend in an elegantly
refurbished Japanese guest house after flying to Tokyo on Friday on
a TWA 747 chartered by Fujisankei Communications Group. The company
is financing the trip at an estimated cost of $7 million, including
the reported $2 million fee to Reagan. Neither the company's
spokesmen nor Reagan's have confirmed the size of his payment.
``I'm not familiar with those details,'' said Reagan aide Mark
Weinberg. Reagan is to meet with Japanese officials and to appear
at a series of company-sponsored events, including two speeches
followed by question-answer sessions.
   The Japanese government is co-host for a visit first discussed
in 1983, and again in 1988, before Reagan left office. Charles Z.
Wick, former director of the U.S. Information Agency and a close
friend of the Reagans, helped arrange the visit and was traveling
with them.
   About 200 dependents of American military personnel stationed in
Japan flew there for visits on the chartered jet. They are to
return to Los Angeles with the Reagans on Oct. 28.
   The staff, office and expense appropriations provided to former
presidents date back 21 years. Costs have been increasing, and
there have been proposals to limit that spending during the past
five years. The Reagan controversy may give that movement a push.
   ``We owe our former presidents protection and respect, but do we
owe them a guarantee to underwrite whatever future business
ventures they may undertake for personal gain?'' Pryor asked.
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, has proposed a bill to limit
staff and expense payments to former presidents, and also to
provide for annual reviews of their security needs beginning five
years after they leave office. ``While they should be rewarded for
their service to this country, it is not appropriate to treat them
as royalty at taxpayer expense,'' Grassley said when he introduced
it last summer.
   The appropriation Congress has just passed provides $559,500 for
Reagan, $387,800 for Jimmy Carter, $426,800 for Gerald R. Ford and
$426,700 for Nixon.
   Nixon's assistant said none of the money he gets has been used
on his books ``or any other profit-making work.'' John H. Taylor
said Nixon does not accept speech fees despite offers that total
$720,000 a year.

   ``Lost Angels'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated R.)
   
   Southern California youth, Hollywood would have us believe, are
interested only in sex, drugs, alcohol, fast cars, good times and
having their own outtasight pads. They love to spend their parents'
money, except they're too stupid to really know how to count change
and bills, so they steal or hustle or use credit cards.
   These same spoiled, empty and ignorant teens pop up like
laminated paperdolls in Hugh Hudson's ``Lost Angels,'' a
superficial tale about some seriously disturbed young people and
their seriously disturbed parents.
   Unlike ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' and other teen-oriented
movies in which irresponsibility and often crime are played for
laughs, ``Lost Angels'' takes a hard line and tells us that
trashing someone else's property, driving a car into a swimming
pool or physically abusing another youngster for being a good
student or a virgin just isn't very nice.
   Tim Doolan (Adam Horovitz) lives with his bloated mother and her
bloated second husband in an affluent housing development. Mother
snivels about how good stepdad is to take them in. Stepdad talks
about discipline but crudely urinates in a punch bowl during a
party.
   Tim hangs out with a gang called D.A.B. (Dead at Birth). They're
middle-class white kids who have nothing better to do with their
time such as read, develop a skill or hobby, get an after-school
job or do volunteer work, pursue cultural activities or sports. So
they adapt Hispanic names and rumble with the 10th Street Gang, a
group of Latin kids.
   When they're not fighting, hurling racial slurs or otherwise
trying to prove the superiority of the white race, they break into
the homes of vacationing families and destroy everything in sight.
Why? No reason, opines one D.A.B. member, it's just something to
do. These are kids whose parents have money, but do not have class,
values or culture.
   Tim is arrested and sent to juvenile hall after his girlfriend
gets high and parks her mother's new car in the family pool. He's
sent to Valley Acres, a center for troubled youth.
   This is where the filmmakers slip into ``David and Lisa'' land.
But the celebrated 1963 Frank Perry movie was an intelligent, case
history drama with a degree of authenticity. ``Lost Angels'' has
none of those qualities. Even Donald Sutherland as a tortured
alcoholic and committed doctor can not save this video, which is
not worth the rental.

   ``Pet Sematary'' (Paramount Home Video. Priced for Rental. Rated
R)
   
   Victims in horror movies have one thing in common: They lack
common sense and use bad judgment. In short, they're stupid.
   ``Pet Sematary,'' the film adaptation of Stephen King's novel,
offers a good look at the stupidity factor.
   Louis Creed moves his wife, Rachel, daughter, Ellie, and toddler
son, Gage, into a house on one of the fastest trucker speed strips
in Maine. The minute they arrive, the wife takes Gage out of his
car seat, sets him on the lawn and turns her back on him. Gage
wanders towards the highway to wave to a passing truck. A neighbor,
Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne), snatches the lad out of the jaws of
steel just in time.
   Do the Creeds put up a fence? Don't be silly.
   The stupidity factor escalates. During a family picnic, Creed
allows Gage to fly a kite and hands him the ball of twine. The baby
drops the twine and all watch as the kite runs away. Creed turns
his back on the baby, who dashes after the kite and into a truck.
   But that's not the end of Gage, and only the beginning of the
horror awaiting the Creeds.
   Because the movie's characters do so many misguided things,
their behavior and the film's action becomes more predictable and
less scary. Everything is neatly laid out in ``Pet Sematary,'' and
that's one of the problems; you don't feel the hairs twitching on
your neck. And what's the point of a horror movie if it doesn't
scare you?
   ``Pet Sematary,'' beautifully photographed by Peter Stein,
explores the human fear of death and dying, and the tempting notion
of bringing back the dead. But as Jud says, ``sometimes dead is
better.''
   Behind the crudely constructed cemetery for pets, which had been
made over several generations by children, is an ancient Indian
burial ground. Only problem, the soil has ``gone sour'' and the
place is evil.
   Creed finds out when Jud takes him there to bury Ellie's cat,
Church, who had also tap-danced with a truck. But Jud neglects to
tell Creed that what returns isn't always the same as what was
buried. Sweet and gentle Church returns as Pit Cat.
   So it is with a certain prescient horror that Creed takes his
dead son to the same burial ground. What comes back would make
Freddie and Jason proud.
   There's plenty of slicing and dicing in ``Pet Sematary,'' and
some clever special effects by Lance and David Anderson to show
spilled brains, severed heads, etc. There's also a campy turn near
the end as Creed finally kills the returned Gage. The baby, who has
just come off a killing spree, looks at him, pouts and says, ``no
fair.''
   Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby are just fine as Louis and
Rachel. But Gwynne upstages even Church the Pit Cat with his down
East flavor.
   King wrote the screenplay and tries to remain true to his book,
which was not necessarily a wise move because the story doesn't
move fast enough and, even at the slow pace, there are a lot of
holes.
   Still, it's an OK video for a rainy Halloween weekend.

   A new museum will be created in Pittsburgh to house the works of
pop artist Andy Warhol. More than 700 Warhol paintings, prints,

   Three of Victoria Guillen's children have
had hepatitis, one daughter has sores up and down her arms and legs
and her husband suffers gastritis. She blames the lack of running
water in her home.
   Many health workers agree that lack of water is the direct cause
of the Guillens' illnesses. They also blame a lack of public policy
in the last decade for failure to find a remedy for her problems
and those of thousands of other ``colonia'' residents living along
the U.S.-Mexico border.
   And they warn that the longer the colonias go without running
water, the greater the threat to the health of the rest of the
nation as people possibly carrying disease cross the border, many
of them migrant workers who travel around the United States.
   ``What we've got is a Third World, part of which happens to be
in the U.S.,'' said Dr. Herbert Ortega, chief of the Pan American
Health Organization's El Paso office.
   Consider:
   _El Paso County's tuberculosis rate is a little less than twice
the national average, and 80 percent are traceable to a foreign
country.
   _Each day, 12 million gallons of raw sewage flow into the
Tijuana River. Another 20 million and 22 million are dumped into
the New River and Rio Grande, respectively, according to an
American Medical Association report.
   _Between 1980 and 1988, the population of Ciudad Juarez, across
the border from El Paso, rose from 714,000 to 1.25 million;
officials estimate anywhere from 83 million to 400 million border
crossings each year.
   _Twenty-five to 50 percent of border residents are living in
poverty.
   Despite these grim statistics, health officials, physicians and
some politicians have been unable to turn the attention of Congress
to the border and change the living conditions of Mrs. Guillen and
other residents.
   The Guillens have lived for 15 years in a trailer home in a
subdivision east of El Paso. They had owned a home in El Paso, but
sold it when they moved to California. When they returned they
discovered they could buy a lot of land for less than it would cost
them to rent a home. They were promised sewer and water hookups
would arrive soon.
   ``It has been a long time, 15 years we have been waiting for
water,'' she said. On the stove, a rusting metal bucket holds water
for cooking, washing dishes and bathing.
   Sometimes the family can get water from neighbors a block away
with running water, but when they run out at odd hours they must
use a backyard pump.
   Mrs. Guillen fondly recalls when the family lived in El Paso.
   ``When my kids were very small, they would get full of dirt and
I was used to letting my kids play, letting them get dirty and then
bathing them. But not here. ... At times I don't even have water
from the pump and the pipes get clogged up. ... We get very tense
because there is not even water to fill the tub. You can imagine.
With a big family and no water for the bathtub. What do we do? We
have to put up with it.''
   Sometimes her husband cleans the pipes to the backyard pump and
ends up covered with sand, Mrs. Guillen said. ``We take a bath with
sand. ... There are a lot of people who take a bath with sand.''
   Last year, three of her children got hepatitis. ``Problems with
water can cause people to have big infectious sores, that erupt
inside your skin. ... Two of my daughters had that same infection
years back.''
   One daughter's foot was so infected it swelled. The girl spent a
summer with an aunt in El Paso ``and believe it or not her (sores)
got better, because she was taking a bath with city water.''
   Mrs. Guillen speaks reverently of the city water. ``It is clean.
Your body feels clean. But with the water she must use, ``I'm not
sure if I smell good because that water smells bad.''
   Health officials hope a recent conference sponsored by the Texas
Medical Association and the recent meeting between President Bush
and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gotari will bring some
remedy to border living conditions.
   ``I don't know ultimately what will come of it, but there is
greater awareness, more interest, more action. The Texas Medical
Association, the American Medical Association are pushing the
administration to respond,'' said Dr. Robert Bernstein, Texas
health commissioner.
   Health officials would most like to see a joint U.S.-Mexico
commission formed and given consistent funding to coordinate the
work of many independent groups trying to alleviate the border
conditions.
   Texas voters will be asked Nov. 7 to approve a $500 million
water bond package, which includes $100 million that could be used
for subsidized loans and grants to provide water and sewage systems
to colonias. The bonds would be guranteed by local governments,
water districts or water supply corporations.
   But even if the money is approved, Comptroller Bob Bullock has
said $100 million would not be enough to upgrade conditions in all
the state's colonias.
   Others see a solution through more involvement by the
``maquiladora'' _ twin-plant _ industries. These foreign-owned
manufacturing centers along the border flourish with cheap Mexican
labor and have drawn millions to the border, overwhelming municipal
infrastructures.
   About 90 percent of the 1,400 maquiladoras in operation are
situated on the U.S.-Mexico border, with 500 plants along the
Texas-Mexico border. Juarez alone has 249, according to the Pan
American Health Organization.
   ``Some of these maquila plants throw their wastes directly into
the sewage disposal system,'' PAHO reported in a recent newsletter.
``Other maquilas sell tanks with toxic residues to questionable
recycling companies.
   ``It has been found that these companies dispel these toxic
tanks into the first dumping site found. The tank ends up sold to a
third party who may use it to store water for their personal
hygiene, and@or to cook or drink.''
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Guillen hopes to have running water by December.
   That's what she's been told.

<HEAD>Industrial Crops May Yield Homegrown Rubber, Newsprint and Lubricants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists believe a new generation of crops
with strange names like guayule, kenaf and jojoba may provide
homegrown rubber for tires, newsprint for daily papers and
lubricants for machines.
   They also could provide thinners for paint, thickeners for
ketchup, moisturizers for cosmetics _ and income for U.S. farmers.
   ``This is the beginning of a whole new revolution in
agriculture,'' said Himayat Naqvi, president of the Association for
the Advancement of Industrial Crops. ``It will give farmers
something different to grow, it will help our trade balance, reduce
our dependence on foreign oil and improve our environment.''
   Scientists, farmers and government officials met in Peoria
earlier this month to discuss crops like vernonia, cuphea and
lesquerella. Chemicals from such plants can be refined to replace
compounds derived from imported oil or from plants raised only in
other nations.
   However, there are few acres of these industrial crops in the
United States and the government spends relatively little to
develop them, said Naqvi, a plant breeder at the University of
California at Riverside.
   The association _ the Peoria meeting was its first _ hopes
Congress will appropriate funds for research so farmers will ``feel
safe growing'' the crops.
   For example, rubber can be extracted from the wild-growing,
southwestern shrub guayule and its quality is as good as the best
foreign rubber. A pilot processing plant will be built in Arizona,
said Naqvi, but improvements must be made in guayule yields for
commercial production to be economical.
   Another promising crop is jojoba, a desert-grown perennial that
produces large brown beans containing a unique oil. It already is
used by the cosmetics industry, but could be an excellent lubricant
because it withstands temperature and friction. But researchers
need to develop better ways to grow and harvest it and control
pests, said Carole Whittaker, president of Hyder Jojoba Inc. of
Phoenix, which has 1,300 acres of jojoba in a remote desert area of
Arizona.
   ``Jojoba is a high value crop that can be grown on marginal land
with far less water than crops like citrus and cotton,'' she said.
``It would be ideal for a state like Arizona where water is a
prized commodity.''
   Commercialization for some industrial crops could be 10 to 20
years away, but Naqvi said the first big success story likely will
be kenaf. These tall, fibrous, annuals could be a raw material
source for paper and cardboard.
   The nation's first kenaf milling plant is expected to open in
1991 in McAllen, Texas, to supply newsprint to the newspaper
industry.
   The new crops will provide alternatives for farmers who have
gotten into serious economic trouble by producing surpluses of
low-value feed grains, Naqvi said. ``If one crop is not working, we
should look for something new. It's not enough just to feel sorry
for our farmers who are not making any money.''
   ``We're a big wheat state and wheat has put a lot of farmers out
of business,'' said Jerry Larson of the Oregon Department of
Agriculture, who thought kenaf could fit into the state's diverse
agriculture. ``We don't want to wait 20 or 30 years. We need a
product that will convince farmers and investors that these things
are going to happen.''
   Grupo Ultra Chem in Brazil is introducing guar, a plant that
yields a gum with a wide range of uses that include thickening
ketchup. Oil from another, vernonia, might be used as a paint
thinner _ without unpleasant fumes.
   ``Environmentally, this is right,'' said Peter Griffee, research
and development manager for Grupo Ultra Chem. ``We're looking for a
new, natural approach to chemical production.''

   Forty years after nuclear wastes were
first dumped into the soil of the Hanford nuclear reservation, the
government is starting to look at just what's brewing under the
surface.
   The ambitious new Molecular Science Research Centeris a symbol
of the U.S. Department of Energy's committment to cleaning up after
production of nuclear weapons at 17 plants around the country, said
Michael Knotek, who left the Brookhaven National Laboratory to
become the center's manager.
   The total cost of the cleanup has been estimated at $90 billion
to $150 billion. ``The country can't afford that,'' said Knotek,
noting that one major mission will be to find technology to reduce
those costs. ``We've got to find a permanent solution. One we can
afford and everybody will be happy with.''
   When it is completed, it will be the only U.S. facility
dedicated to molecular science research, the study of molecules and
how they combine to form structures. Such work is currently
distributed across the country, and the only comparable facility is
in Okazaki, Japan, Knotek said.
   The MSRC takes molecular research out of a closed setting like a
university and into the front line, said Steven Colson, who was
hired from Yale University to be an associate director. ``We're
here on top of a major environmental problem. You don't find that
at a university.''
   The center is expected to focus on problems of cleaning up the
Hanford site. Since 1943, Hanford has produced much of the
plutonium for the nation's nuclear arsenal; it's the Energy
Department's most polluted site with more than half of the nation's
defense wastes. Much of that waste in the past was dumped directly
into the soil.
   What it has been doing underground is not known, said Don
Friedrich, who is using lasers to study the reactions of chemicals
that exist underground. Wastes that could be relatively benign
alone can combine with others, or with elements in the soil, to
become very dangerous; on the other hand, the danger from some
wastes could be reduced by molecular conversion occurring
underground.
   The laser research is designed to give a sort of underground
weather map of the Hanford site, he said. It will help scientists
predict how the wastes are changing, in which direction they are
traveling, and how fast.
   Friedrich is one of about 10 researchers and staff already
working at the center, which is operating on a $6 million 1990
budget and has headquarters at the Pacific Northwest Laboratory run
by Battelle. When a $135 million building is completed by the
mid-1990s, it will have 200 full-time staffers, plus 30 to 50
visiting scientists, and an annual budget of $40 million.
   That is a drop in the bucket compared to the $385 million annual
budget and 6,300 jobs tied to the production of plutonium for
weapons at Hanford in recent years. Plutonium production has
already been sharply curtailed and is expected to be phased out
completely by the mid-1990s.
   Washington state politicians, especially those opposed to
nuclear production at Hanford, have repeatedly argued that waste
cleanup represents the best economic future for the site and the
adjacent Tri-Cities.
   The MSRC and a companion Environmental Center of Excellence,
which will field-test different clean-up proposals, are the
cornerstone of a plan to turn Hanford into the nation's leading
nuclear cleanup research center.
   But it is extremely unlikely the waste research can ever provide
the level of jobs that defense production did, Knotek said.
   Hanford is a good choice for the MSRC because it is next to the
bulk of the nation's defense wastes where ``we will never be able
to forget it,'' and because of the Northwest's strong environmental
interest, he said.
   Knotek considers environmental cleanup a more pressing goal than
the space race set off in the 1950s by the Soviet Sputnik launch.
Sputnik was an implied threat to national security, while nuclear
waste is a real physical problem.
   That should lead to an increase in federal funding for
environmental science research, with a corresponding increase in
jobs for researchers, he said. ``Research follows needs. It's as
simple as that.''

<HEAD>Federal Wildlife Officials to Split Whooping Crane Colony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAUREL, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wildlife officials plan to split the world's
only captive colony of whooping cranes in November to reduce the
chance the flock could be wiped out by disease or natural disaster.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said 22 of the 54 birds at
the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center would be shipped to the
International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis. Whooping cranes are
an endangered species.
   ``The service has been concerned about having all of their eggs
in one basket, literally,'' said David Trauger, the center's deputy
director. ``The service felt it was the prudent thing to do, to
separate the breeding flocks, and there's enough breeders now to do
that.''
   The center started in 1987 to breed the birds, known for their
elaborate courtship dance, under a joint program with Canadian
wildlife officials.
   The foundation was selected as the home of the new flock after
considering several groups around the nation. Although it has not
bred whooping cranes, it has successfully bred 13 of the 14 other
crane species.
   Scientists hope that by successfully breeding whooping cranes in
captivity, they will be able to establish another flock in the
wild. An attempt to do that failed in 1975 when a flock at the
Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho failed to produce
enough eggs to sustain the colony.

<HEAD>Imported Ticks Can Pose Threat to Florida Herds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An African tick brought to the
Caribbean by accident poses a threat to Florida's cattle, sheep,
goat and white-tailed deer, say state veterinary scientists who are
trying to develop a vaccine.
   The ticks can cause a skin condition or heartwater disease that
can kill up to 90 percent of infected animals, University of
Florida scientists say.
   ``If the disease spreads to Florida, we probably would have to
quarantine the whole state. That would be devastating,'' said Dan
Childs, vice chairman of the National Cattlemen's Association
Animal Health Committee.
   Bont ticks, which infest exotic animals such as rhinoceroses and
ostriches. A shipment of rhinoceroses arriving in Texas five years
ago carried them, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a
warning in June after African ticks were found on shipments of
imported ostriches sent to several U.S. cities.
   If nothing is done to control the tick in the Caribbean, it's
only a matter of time before birds or imported animals carry it to
Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad and the United States, said Michael
Burridge, head of the university's Center for Tropical Animal
Health and its Department of Infectious Diseases.
   The ticks can carry a rickettsial bacteria that causes
heartwater disease, which is no threat to humans but causes high
fever and nervous system disorders in animals. Animals often suffer
swelling of the lungs, called pulmonary edema, and
hydropericardium, or water around the heart.
   Florida is one of the top 10 cattle-producing states, said
Childs.
   A team in Zimbabwean has produced a laboratory technique to grow
large quantities of the rickettsial bacteria in culture, but
diagnostic field tests are thought to be some three years away,
Burridge said.
   And a heartwater vaccine would not protect animals from the
associated fatal skin ailment, acute bovine dermatophilosis, which
causes sections of the animal's hide to slough off. Although rare,
the skin disease can affect humans.
   ``It's a horrible disease and we found ... that, for some
reason, it occurs only in the areas where there are tropical bont
ticks,'' Burridge said.
   ``If these ticks should spread to the United States, we're in
big trouble because the organism that causes the skin disease is in
the soil here already, just waiting for this tick to arrive,'' he
said.

   In times of famine, a watery broth with a few
vegetables held off death. In mansion dining rooms, a perfectly
clear consomme shows the epitome of elegance. For centuries, people
have counted on soup.
   ``People like soup because it not only tastes good but they feel
that they are doing something good for themselves,'' said Lee
Bailey, author of the cookbook ``Soup Meals.'' ``It gives you all
the feelings of security that we seem to need more as time goes
by.''
   Although soups are made year-round, harvests seem to bring them
more to mind. The vegetables available enable the home cook to try
all sorts of combinations.
   ``Cabbage and broccoli are very strong. You have to be careful
when you use them with other things. They combine well with
potatoes, but they can overwhelm other things,'' Bailey said. ``You
can otherwise combine anything that suits your fancy.''
   Soups have several advantages. In most kitchens, an inventive
cook can find ingredients for a serviceable soup. Soup can be made
ahead. And most soups can be frozen.
   If using canned stock, taste the soup before adding salt. The
flavor of canned stock can be substantially improved by letting it
simmer for a half hour or so with chopped carrots, onions and
celery before it is used.
   For cream soups, pureed vegetables or rice can substitute for
cream.
   Here are some recipes from Lee Bailey's ``Soup Meals'' (Clarkson
N. Potter Inc., 1989, $19.95):

<NOTE>Turkey and Vegetable Soup</NOTE>
<NOTE>Ingredients</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   2 tablespoon safflower oil
   1 raw turkey breast carcass with meat on bones, chopped roughly
into 4 or 5 pieces
   7 cups chicken stock
   4 cups water
   { large red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
   2 cups fresh green beans, pureed to the consistency of relish
   1{ pounds potatoes, peeled and cubed
   4 large sprigs parsley, chopped
   { teaspoon black pepper
   1 10-ounce package frozen peas
   In the safflower oil, carefully and thoroughly brown the turkey
carcass parts and any bits of leftover meat. This may take about
five minutes or more. Add stock and water. Bring to a simmer and
continue to cook about 40 minutes, skimming occasionally. Remove
the bones and meat and let them cool. Remove meat from bones and
chop coarsely. Discard bones.
   Add onion and green bean puree to the liquid and simmer over
very low heat. Add potatoes and set timer for five minutes. Add
parsely and pepper. (The pepper is very important here, so don't be
shy about the amount.) Add reserved turkey meat and simmer just
long enough to finish cooking the potatoes. Add peas and continue
cooking for just a minute or so to heat them through.
   (Yield: 8 servings).

   The recent stock market turmoil has provided a
grim backdrop for the second anniversary today of Black Monday,
Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones average plunged a record 508
points.
   After the Friday-the-13th selloff last week that drove the Dow
down 190 points, it looked as if stocks were heading for something
similar to the crash of two years ago.
   But the market has settled down this week, gradually allaying
those fears. In Wednesday's trading, the Dow Jones average of 30
big industrial stocks rose 4.92 to 2,643.65, bringing its net gain
over the past three days to 74.39 points.
   However, if that steady showing came as a relief, it did not
necessarily provide much reassurance for anyone who follows the ups
and downs of stock prices.
   Indeed, the image of Wall Street as a sort of upscale gambling
den once again has been reinforced in many minds by the latest
gyrations. To individual investors, who have been withdrawing more
money than they put into direct stock holdings for two decades now,
stocks are widely seen as ``too risky'' and ``too volatile.''
   While nobody disputes that risk and volatility are facts of life
in stock investing, long-time students of the markets say those two
perils are often viewed in a distorted light.
   Volatility _ the tendency of stock prices to rise and fall
dramatically in short periods of time _ has drawn more and more
attention in recent years with advances in technology and the
concentration of large amounts of capital in the hands of
professional traders and money managers.
   With instant communications and computers programmed to execute
buy and sell orders, the market now can react within moments to
changing news developments that might once have taken weeks to
absorb.
   But the importance of short-term changes in stock prices
diminishes drastically if one examines what has happened in the
market in the post-World War II era.
   Since the late 1970s, stocks have suffered four separate
``October massacres.'' Yet this month also brings another, happier
anniversary, notes Norman Fosback, editor of the investment
advisory letter Market Logic.
   ``Fifteen years ago, amidst the turmoil of Watergate disclosures
and the gloom of a deep recession, the current bull market was
born,'' he states.
   From its low of 577.60 in late 1974 through its recent highs
near 2,800, the Dow Jones industrial average nearly quintupled, and
other, broader measures of stock price trends recorded even greater
gains.
   Results like these were achieved during a time of economic
growth, erratic though it may have been from year to year. They by
no means preclude the possibility of a long-term decline in stock
prices should the economy languish for an extended period.
   But they do buttress the case that the impact of short-term
volatility can be substantially cushioned by the passage of time.
   When people set about choosing individual stocks to buy, they
face a second hazard sometimes referred to as ``company risk.''
   That is familiar to people, for example, who might have bought
shares of a respected blue chip like U.S. Steel for an effective
price of $68 in the 1960s, and seen the stock wither to about half
that value today under its present name, USX Corp.
   Even before yu factor in inflation, that's a lot of damage for a
small investor to suffer.
   The standard strategy for dealing with company risk is to
diversify _ spreading investment money over stocks of several
companies in dissimilar businesses, or buying shares of two or
three mutual funds. That way, a single big loser poses a much
smaller risk of wiping you out.

   The first Diamond-Star Motors Corp. cars
bound for sale in Japan are expected to roll off the assembly line
next week, said officials who gathered to celebrate the company's
first Japanese exports.
   ``We're excited and proud that cars manufactured and assembled
in Illinois will now be sold in Mitsubishi showrooms in Japan,''
said Diamond-Star Chairman Lino Piedra.
   Diamond-Star, a joint venture of Chrysler Motors and Mitsubishi
Motors, will produce about 1,500 Mitsubishi Eclipse automobiles for
export to Japan by year's end, the company said Wednesday.
   ``Exporting cars to Japan represents a major milestone for both
the workers of Diamond-Star and our parent companies,'' Piedra said
in a news release.
   A spokeswoman for Diamond-Star conceded that the 1,500 cars
bound for Japan represent a very small percentage of the 52,000
cars produced at the plant so far this year, but said the company
hopes to build its exports.
   ``Probably the number we're going to produce this year (for
Japan) is not a large amount,'' said spokeswoman Robin Skiles.
``But we have to start somewhere.''

   International Business Machines Corp. said its
board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $1
billion worth of IBM stock.
   IBM already has bought back more than $5 billion of its own
shares since early 1986, making the company its own most loyal

   The announcement Wednesday was made after the close of trading.
IBM's stock fell 50 cents a share to $101.75 in consolidated New

   The latest repurchase would amount to about 3.4 percent of the
company's roughly 579 million outstanding shares at current stock

   ``We view it as a good long-term investment,'' IBM spokesman
John Boudreaux said. For shareholders, he said, ``it has a positive

<HEAD>US to Halt Purchases of Mexican Oil for Emergency Reserve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will quit buying
Mexican oil for the U.S. emergency stockpile early next year,
ending an eight-year supply link aimed in part at aiding the
debt-ridden Mexican economy, sources said.
   The administration and the Mexican state oil company, Pemex,
agreed that an existing supply contract expiring Nov. 30 will not
be renewed, said an Energy Department source who spoke on condition
he not be identified.
   Additional Mexican oil will be purchased for three months beyond
the contract's expiration in order to satisfy a minimum volume
requirement, the source said Wednesday.
   The arrangement is to be announced next month, according to an
internal Energy Department memorandum made available to The
Associated Press.
   Starting in December, the Energy Department will meet its
stockpile needs by soliciting bids for short-term supply deals with
domestic and foreign suppliers _ the usual practice before the
Mexican contracts started in 1981.
   In August 1982, at the height of Mexico's foreign debt crisis,
the Reagan administration agreed to pay Mexico $1 billion in
advance for oil to be put in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The decision to end contract purchases from Mexico is due in
part to a growing constraint on Mexico's capability to produce
enough high-quality Isthmus crude to meet both export and domestic
demand, the source said.
   The reserve was started in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo and
is designed to give the United States enough emergency supplies to
weather any future disruption of oil imports. The oil, about 575
million barrels, is stored in underground salt domes in Texas and
Louisiana. Nearly half has come from Mexico and only 6 percent from
U.S. wells.
   On Tuesday the department gave Congress an interim report that
suggested ways to cut costs of filling the reserve, including
leasing oil from foreign producers and selling U.S. government
bonds to finance the reserve.
   An Energy Department delegation is to fly to the Middle East
early next month to discuss the leasing idea and other topics with
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, a department
source said.

   Early indications were that California's
strong economy would shake off the effects of the devastating
earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos said damage in his city and county
alone might reach $2 billion.
   But in a sign of investor confidence in the state, California
municipal bond issues were down only slightly Wednesday and in line
with the overall decline in the market, said Mark Haslinger, a
senior vice president with the investment house Clayton Brown &amp;
Associates in New York.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., which evaluates the safety of bond
issues and other financial instruments, said it expected the credit
impact to be localized. And it said it did not expect to adjust its
ratings of the financial obligations of major West Coast financial
institutions.
   John Sullivan, the undersecretary of the state Department of
Business, Transportation and Housing, said Wednesday he stayed up
all night assessing the situation, but that it was still too early
to set a damage figure.
   However, he said, ``Overall the impact will be one the state
will recover from very quickly.
   ``We have a large, strong economy, and while the personal
tragedy for many families is great, the overall economic picture
for the Bay Area and the rest of the state is unclouded by this,''
he said.
   Sullivan said he was optimistic about the insurance business.
   ``We don't have huge areas of just massive devastation, block
after block, fortunately,'' Sullivan said.
   While damage appeared extremely heavy in such cities as Santa
Cruz and Watsonville, Farmers Insurance Group Inc. spokesman
Jeffrey Beyer said he tended to agree with Sullivan that most
insurers would have no major problems.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, San Francisco-area businesses began to
return to normal.
   Most shuttered companies planned to reopen in the next day or
two. Many of them continued operations from offices outside the
Silicon Valley.
   ``As long as you can manufacture, as long as you can ship and as
long as sales people around the world are selling, we're OK,'' said
Kevin Sullivan, senior vice president for Apple Computer Inc.,
which closed its Cupertino complex Wednesday.
   The complex of about 20 buildings was still without power nearly
24 hours after the quake, but company officials were optimistic
they could reopen today or Friday.
   International Business Machines Corp. closed one plant with
8,500 employees just south of San Jose, but kept open another plant
in the city itself, said Dave Berman, communications manager.
   At Amdahl Corp., a Silicon Valley manufacturer of mainframe
computers, the computer system crashed, then was brought back up _
albeit at one-third the usual speed _ in a backup mode late Tuesday
night.
   Advanced Micro Devices Inc., another big Sunnyvale-based
high-tech company, said it called off the overnight shift Tuesday
but normal operations resumed with the start of the day shift
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Many Homeowners Not Insured; Analysts Say Disaster May Benefit Insurers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Those who follow the insurance industry
see opportunities for investors in the wake of the San Francisco
earthquake.
   Analysts predicted insurers will be able to reverse three years
of declining rates in California by increasing pressure on state
regulators to boost premiums as a result of the earthquake and the
estimated $4 billion in damage from Hurricane Hugo in South
Carolina.
   An increase in insurance rates could translate into greater
profitability in the long term, which in turn would boost the value
of stocks, the analysts said Wednesday.
   ``There's a perception that this could turn the cycle .... that
this could be enough to firm pricing,'' said Gloria L. Vogel, an
analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. in New York.
   Insurance companies struggled Wednesday to assess the amount of
claims they're likely to pay as a result of the quake. In addition
to home damage, the insurance companies are likely to face claims
for automobile damage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business
interruption due to electrical outages, water damage and, possibly,
workers compensation.
   Some estimated that damages will reach $1 billion or more. But
industry observers said they don't expect any company to be
seriously hurt by claims arising from the quake.
   ``We don't think any company is going to have problems paying
claims,'' said Elisa Siegal, public affairs manager for the
American Insurance Association, a Washington-based trade group.
   Easing the burden on insurers is the fact that most homeowners
in the San Francisco area don't have earthquake insurance on their
houses.
   The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said
that in the San Francisco area, 25 to 30 percent of the homes have
earthquake insurance. The organization estimated residential damage
at $500 million in the Bay area, with $100 million to $150 million
of that insured.
   Statewide in California, only 15 to 20 percent of all homeowners
have earthquake insurance, which typically requires a 10 percent
deductible and costs $200 to $400 a year for a $100,000 home,
according to industry spokesmen.
   Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will have to
pay for repairs to their houses themselves, unless their homes are
ravaged by fire. Fire damage is covered under basic homeowner
insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophe
services at the Property Loss Research Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill.
   ``If there was fire damage, the fire is covered. That's quite
specific,'' Strawn said.
   Earthquake insurance is an emotional and politically-charged
issue in California, where many of the nation's most damaging
earthquakes have occurred.
   Under a 1985 California law, insurers are required to offer
earthquake insurance to homebuyers, but homebuyers are not required
to buy the coverage.
   Insurers aren't required to offer earthquake insurance to
commercial property owners, but the percentage of business property
with the coverage is higher than that of homeowners, industry
spokesmen said. They estimated that at least 25 percent, and
probably many more, business properties are insured.
   Because of its high costs, earthquake insurance has become a
target of the controversial Proposition 103 approved by California
voters last year. The proposition calls for a 20 percent rollback
in insurance rates. Insurers and state regulators are battling over
the rates and how they're set.

<HEAD>Texas Instruments Unveils First Magazine Ad That Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There've been pop-up ads, scented ads, even a
magazine spread that played Christmas music. But this week Texas
Instruments Inc. has taken it a step further with a magazine ad
that ``talks'' to readers.
   ``I am the talking chip, one of many Texas Instruments MegaChip
Technologies that are changing the way the world lives, works and
plays,'' says the voice generated by a miniscule computer chip that
costs less than $2 to produce.
   ``This ad demonstrates a new tool for creative people to deliver
powerful messages in an arresting way,'' said Bill Edwards, who
supervised the project for the Dallas office of the McCann-Erickson
advertising agency.
   ``Who can ignore a printed page in Business Week that talks to
you?'' he said. ``The effect is truly startling.''
   The ad will run in 140,000 copies of Business Week's Oct. 20
industrial-technology edition and 76,000 copies of its Nov. 20
international editions.
   The ad also features a tear-away section, allowing a look at the
credit-card-sized, eighth-inch thick gadget that contains three
batteries with enough juice for 650 repetitions; a microprocessor
that performs 61 chores and generates the voice; and a one-inch
speaker.
   The chip represents the latest advance in speech synthesis
semiconductors, said TI's Ken Melvin, product manager for
semiconductor speech.
   ``For years, high-quality speech has been a luxury that
manufactures added only to consumer products with price points of
$50, $75, $100 or more,'' Melvin said. ``Our goal has been to
reduce the cost of speech technology to make it practical in more
applications.''
   TI hopes the advertisement will demonstrate not only marketing
possibilities, but spark ideas for other uses of the silicon wafer.
   Reducing the chip cost to under $2 allows products using the
technology to sell at retail for about $10, Melvin said.
   One possible use for the chip is the creation of talking
products for the visually handicapped, which would contain verbal
warnings or statements about their use.
   Magazine advertisers in recent years gone to extraordinary
lengths to make their messages stand out.
   TransAmerica, for instance, devised an ad that ran in Time
magazine in 1986 that featured a pop-up of a facsimile of its
distinctive San Francisco tower. Dodge trucks had a similar pop-up
ad for its midsize pickup truck in a 1987 issue of Sports
Illustrated.
   Also in 1987, the importers of Absolut vodka introduced sound to
mass-market magazine advertising by including a battery-powered
microchip that played Christmas music when its ad in The New Yorker
magazine was opened. Absolut's most recent ad features a punch-out
paper bottle of its vodka that produces a 3-D image when the reader
looks through two eye holes in it.
   TI began using speech technology in 1974 and in 1978 introduced
its popular Speak and Spell line of educational toys. In the
meantime, all sorts of products have begun to talk: books, cars,
alarm clocks, toys, learning aids and appliances.
   TI also uses its speech know-how in many of its military
projects.
   Texas Instruments' ad was developed with Intervisual
Communications and McCann-Erickson.

<HEAD>AMR Says Trump Offer `Ill-Considered'; Trump Calls AMR `Smug'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AMR Corp. has broken its silence imposed since
Donald Trump made his since-aborted $7.5 billion takeover offer,
calling the bid for the parent of American Airlines
``ill-considered and reckless.''
   The New York billionaire retorted Wednesday that the board's
statement was ``strident and pompously self-serving'' and accusing
AMR management of ``smugness'' in it attitude toward stockholders.
   After a meeting Wednesday, the AMR board issued a statement
saying, ``We are pleased that Mr. Donald Trump has withdrawn his
uninvited proposal to negotiate a cash merger agreement with AMR.
... AMR has not been, and is not, for sale.''
   The statement was the first of substance from the Fort
Worth-based company since it received Trump's offer Oct. 4.
   ``AMR has been operating pursuant to a highly successful
long-term plan designed to create growth and value,'' the statement
said. ``We see absolutely no basis for departing from that strategy
and believe that the imposition of a highly leveraged capital
structure would have very unfavorable effects.''
   The board took no other action stemming from Trump's offer, said
spokesman John Hotard.
   Some industry analysts had speculated the board might erect
stronger takeover defenses, such as taking advantage of lower stock
prices to create an employee stock ownership plan that would place
a big block of shares in presumably friendly hands, making a
hostile takeover nearly impossible.
   ``AMR's reference to its successful long-term plan ... is
particularly ironic on a day that AMR reported a significant
decline in net income ... and has warned its shareholders of a
disappointing fourth quarter to come,'' Trump said in New York.
   ``AMR's smugness about its marketplace perception ought perhaps
to give way to a concern for its shareholders,'' he said. ``To
date, AMR has yet to pay any dividend.''
   AMR stock rose 75 cents to close at $74 a share Wednesday in
heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Trump withdrew his bid Monday because of the tumble in AMR's
stock price during and after the market's Friday the 13th selloff.
   The selloff was sparked by troubles in financing a $6.75 billion
management-employee buyout of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.
AMR stock had hit $107 immediately after Trump's offer, but fell to
the mid-$70s in the market plunge.
   Trump said he would consider other options, including selling
his AMR shares or making a lower offer. However, analysts doubt he
can return with a bid below the $120 a share he already offered.
   Financing questions dogged Trump's proposal and analysts
questioned how he would raise enough money in the unsettled credit
markets beyond the $1 billion in equity he promised to put up
himself.
   AMR had focused on the debt in its initial, vague response to
the flashy tycoon's proposal for the nation's largest airline and
Chairman Robert L. Crandall repeated that concern Wednesday.
   ``Imposing extraordinary levels of debt on an airline,
particularly without the active cooperation of both management and
employees, will not serve the long-term interests of anyone,''
Crandall said.
   ``The public will be disadvantaged if excessive financing
reduces an airline's ability to seize new opportunities, to
promptly replace old airplanes, to be responsive to environmental
desires for quieter airplanes, to produce adequate passenger and
freight facilities, to finance state-of-the-art maintenance and
pilot training facilities ...,'' Crandall said.
   AMR said its profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to
$137 million, or $2.16 per share, from $150.3 million, or $2.50 a
share, in the same period last year. Revenue rose to $2.73 billion
from $2.33 billion last year.
   Crandall blamed the results on a slight decrease in yield and a
more than 11 percent increase in fuel prices from a year earlier,
and said AMR expected those trends to continue in the fourth
quarter.
   ``This unhappy outlook ... underscores the continuing volatility
of airline earnings and the importance of an adequate capital
base,'' he said.
   Crandall told analysts last month that profits through next year
would be squeezed by the gradual recovery of Eastern Airlines from
a crippling strike, higher labor costs, expansion of service and
purchase of new aircraft.
   Crandall said the airline had 21.6 percent of the domestic
market during the quarter.
   For the first nine months, AMR's earnings rose 15.5 percent to
$415.9 million, or $6.59 per share, from $360.1 million, or $5.99
per share, a year earlier. Revenue in the nine-month period rose to
$7.89 billion from $6.46 billion.

<HEAD>Ex-Prosecutor: Use Racketeering Laws on S&amp;L Mess</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former top federal prosecutor says the
crippling fines and forfeiture provisions of the federal
racketeering law should be turned on those accused of fraud in the
savings and loan scandals.
   And the man who helped craft the controversial Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act agrees.
   At a conference discussing the future of RICO, Joseph diGenova,
former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said the law was
``perfect for what went on in the savings and loan industry.''
   Congress has enacted a $50 billion bailout plan for the nation's
faltering savings and loans, many of which failed because of fraud,
mismanagement and the economic downturn in the Southwest.
   In April, the government seized a large California thrift,
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, and filed a $1.1
billion civil lawsuit against its operators, charging fraud and
racketeering.
   James Barth, chief economist at the Office of Thrift
Supervision, attributed approximately one in 10 failures to fraud.
   ``It seems to me that knowing what we know about RICO, and
knowing what we know about the S&amp;L crisis, that Congress could not
have enacted a better statute to deal with what went on in the
savings and loan industry over the last few years,'' said diGenova,
now in private practice.
   That notion was seconded by G. Robert Blakey, a University of
Notre Dame professor who was one of the architects of the RICO
statute nearly 20 years ago.
   ``It's not a single instance of fraud but it would be a pattern
of frauds: multiple bad loans of one kind and another, insiders
dealing with outsiders. That falls within the core meaning of RICO,
mail fraud and wire fraud.''
   Their remarks came at a conference, ``RICO, Rights and the
Constitution,'' sponsored by the Cato Institute, a Washington-based
think tank.
   Passed by Congress in 1970 as part of the Organized Crime
Control Act, RICO was designed to make it easier for prosecutors to
go after mobsters by giving them a tool to attack seemingly
legitimate businesses associated with organized crime.
   Prosecutors can take seemingly unrelated crimes or alleged
crimes committed by several people over a 10-year-period, and if
they can convince a jury that those charged were linked through a
``criminal enterprise,'' they can win a racketeering conviction.
   Those convicted are subject to maximum penalties of 20 years in
prison, hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and forfeiture of
illegal profits into the millions, if the government can collect.
   In civil RICO cases, brought either by the government or private
parties, defendants are liable to pay triple damages if found to
have engaged in a ``racketeering enterprise.''
   Though tremendously successful in the Justice Department's
attack on the Mafia, RICO has become increasingly controversial as
prosecutors used it on crooked politicians and businessmen in cases
that critics say might not have been brought under other laws.
   But in reply to that argument, diGenova countered: ``No one
seems to have a problem with applying RICO to the Colombo
(organized crime) family or the Genovese (organized crime) family
or anyone of a number of families whose names end in vowels. The do
have a problem, apparently, applying RICO to people whose names
don't end in vowels and run what are called legitimate businesses
but who happen to engage in massive fraud.

   A devastating earthquake in California failed to move the U.S.
oil futures market despite reports of major pipeline shutdowns.
   Late Wednesday, inspectors examined gasoline pipelines in
Northern California for possible leaks or ruptures while major oil
companies made contingency plans to avoid supply disruptions.
   Officials said the pipelines were closed as a precaution
following Tuesday's earthquake.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, fell 19 cents to
finish at $20.56 cents a barrel after a brief earthquake-related
rally at the opening.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for November delivery closed at
54.58 cents a gallon, down 1.26 cents from Tuesday, and November
heating oil dipped 0.45 cent to settle at 60.60 cents a gallon.
   Energy brokers said weekly inventory statistics that showed a
5.7-million-barrel rise in crude oil last week helped weaken the
market once earthquake news was absorbed.
   Pipeline owners in Northern California, including Chevron Corp.,
Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline Partners and Shell Co., said hundreds of
miles of underground gasoline pipes were closed Tuesday when the
quake hit.
   No damage was detected as of late Wednesday and the pipelines
were expected to resume normal operations, they said.
   ``We know of no line ruptures or seam leaks,'' said John Abboud,
senior vice president for Santa Fe Pacific, which has 800 miles of
pipeline stretching from San Francisco to Reno, Nev. ``We will do
some low-pressure testing and once we're satisfied that the lines
are in good shape, we will start the system back up.''
   The pipelines deliver gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from
Richmond, Calif., refineries to big terminals. Products are then
trucked to service stations.
   Chevron Corp. and Exxon Corp. both reported minor damage to
refineries.
   Chevron spokesman Hal Holt said the quake jolted Chevron's
315,000 barrel-a-day Richmond facility but the plant resumed normal
operations early in the day. Exxon said it slowed operations
slightly at its 135,000-barrel-a-day Benicia, Calif., refinery.
Spokesman Henry Beathard said the company did not know when normal
refinery operations would resume.
   Several companies said they were making contingency plans to
ensure delivery of products by truck in case pipelines remained
closed.
   ``Theoretically, we could bring product up from Los Angeles or
Bakersfield if necessary,'' said Albert Greenstein, spokesman for
Atlantic Richfield Co.
   Companies also said they were inspecting underground storage
tanks at service stations and establishing alternate delivery
routes to avoid damaged roadways.
   Texaco Inc. said its Richmond terminal sustained minor damage
but would not disrupt deliveries.
   Unocal Corp. said between 12,000 and 15,000 barrels of gasoline
leaked from three storage tanks at its Richmond terminal but the
spill was contained.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Ahead of U.S. Consumer Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in early European trading in
anticipation of the U.S. Consumer Price Index for September to be
released later today, which dealers expect to set a trend for the
currency.
   Gold was slightly higher.
   Dealers said the dollar was still under pressure following a
larger-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in August and relaxed
monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve following Friday's
stock market slide.
   The price index was expected to rise 0.4 percent after being
unchanged in August, dealers said.
   ``We're seeing a very quiet, technical market this morning,''
said one trader in Milan. ``Nonetheless, there is still evidence of
volatility. We don't have a determined trend.''
   A dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said: ``The dollar has been
strongly offered in recent days, so we are actually surprised that
it isn't even lower. ... The market is waiting for another piece of
bad news, and then it will go down quickly.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.55 yen to a closing 141.55 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted lower, at 141.25 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.84495 West German marks, down from 1.8525;
1.6193 Swiss francs, down from 1.6255; 6.26725 French francs, down
from 6.2990; 2.08425 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0818; 1,359.50
Italian lire, down from 1,366.00; 1.17325 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1737.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.60075 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5880 late
Wednesday.
   Bullion dealers said trading was quiet as gold showed a subdued
reaction to the weaker dollar.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $368.40 a troy ounce, up
from late Wednesday's $368.25. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $368.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $368.75, up from late Wednesday's
$368.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 51 cents to close at a bid
$368.89.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.12 a troy
ounce, up from late Wednesday's $5.11.

   Stock prices rose for the third consecutive session
today, continuing their comeback from Monday's plunge.
   Meanwhile, the dollar declined against the Japanese yen. The
U.S. currency closed at 141.55 yen, down 0.55 yen from Wednesday's
142.10 yen-close. It opened at 140.97 yen and moved between 140.80
yen and 141.70 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues gained 266.66 points, or 0.76 percent, closing at
35,374.22. It had gained 111.48 points Wednesday and 527.39 on
Tuesday.
   ``The Tokyo market has completely recovered from its large drop
Monday,'' said Shunichi Ishimura, a senior dealer at Nomura
Securities.
   The index fell 647.33 points on Monday, this year's largest
one-day loss, following the big tumble in prices in New York on
Friday, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 190 points.
   The Nikkei index has shot up a total of 905.53 points since
Monday.
   Share prices rose steadily despite uncertainties about prospects
for the U.S. economy, Ishimura said.
   ``Investors' major concern was whether the United States is
going to ease its monetary policy and cut the discount rate,'' he
said.
   Trading was fairly active, with first section volume estimated
at 800 million shares, the same as Wednesday.
   Steel, construction and railway issues were among the gainers.
   In currency dealings, the dollar opened sharply lower following
selling on overseas markets, said Yuji Nakao, a trader with
Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   After that, he said, market participants could not decide the
dollar's direction.
   ``The dollar has become less attractive to investors,'' he said,
citing U.S. economic developments including a wider trade deficit,
Friday's stock price plunge and lower interest rates.

   Stock prices advanced in modest trading Thursday,
boosted largely by technical factors linked to a squeeze among
investors shopping for blue chip stocks.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 16.1
points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,186.2 at midday.
   Dealers said the market had not reacted substantially to a
flurry of British economic indicators released just before midday.
Some expressed disappointment over September's record bank loans of
10.2 billion pounds, or $16.3 billion, saying this could be a
factor in pressuring Britain to maintain high interest rates.
   The market was expected to continue firm at least ahead of Wall
Street's opening. But dealers cautioned that the thin and largely
directionless market would take its cue from New York once it opens.
   Volume was 222 million shares, a modest turnover in comparison
to previous sessions this week.

<HEAD>Stock Stabilizes, Machinists Get Part of Blame for Deal's Failure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI T. PRASSO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp.'s stock price appears to have
stabilized, but dealmakers trying to salvage a proposed buyout of
the parent of United Airlines may have trouble courting one
prospective investor, British Airways PLC.
   Derek Stevens, British Airways' chief financial officer, said
his company was ``in no way committed to a deal going through at
all.''
   Stevens, in an interview with Dow Jones News Service, also said
his company might reduce its planned equity investment of $750
million if a new UAL buyout deal is put together.
   A buyout offer of $230 a share would be ``certainly not too
low,'' Stevens said.
   Meanwhile, UAL's stock closed at $191.75 Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange, down a comparatively small $6.25 following a
two-day drop of $81.62 at the beginning of the week.
   ``The worst of the sell-off appears to be over at this point,''
said Stephen Dexter, an airline industry analyst with Kemper
Financial Services Inc., who predicted speculators would watch the
market until concrete terms of a new bid are announced.
   Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank said Wednesday they were
continuing to court Japanese lenders, who balked at the original
deal, with a sweeter offer. A Citicorp spokesman in Tokyo has said
the new offer was worth $250 a share, or $5.62 billion
   The group trying acquire the nation's second-largest air carrier
said Friday it could not get banks to finance its $6.75 billion,
$300-a-share offer.
   That announcement from the group _ made up of United pilots, UAL
management and British Airways PLC _ helped spark a stock market
plunge and the biggest one-day decline in the Dow Jones industrial
average since the crash of 1987. The widely-followed index tumbled
190 points Friday.
   A British Airways spokesman in New York, John Lampl, said he
could not comment on how long it would take to reconstruct a
revised formal proposal. Spokesmen for the pilots union could not
be reached Wednesday.
   Billionaire investor Marvin Davis said he remained interested in
acquiring UAL, but not at the $300-a-share level he previously
offered. Davis started the buyout fight for UAL when he submitted a
bid in August.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, which represents nearly 25,000 of United's 70,000 workers,
vehemently opposed the pilot-management group's original bid.
   It contended the plan would put the airline into too much debt,
and that the 10 percent steady revenue-growth projections on which
the deal was based were unrealistic.
   On Tuesday, the Machinists called for the resignation of UAL
Chairman Stephen M. Wolf and asked for a federal investigation into
possible violations of securities laws by UAL and Davis.
   ``It's very, very important, especially from the Japanese
viewpoint, that there is some semblance of labor harmony,'' Dexter
said of the Machinist actions.
   But even with the Machinists' continued opposition, Japanese
backers could agree to finance a less risky bid of under $250 a
share, he said.
   Machinists spokesman Jim Conley said the union was not looking
for credit for quashing the original proposal, but was happy to
accept it.
   ``Had we gone along with it I think it probably would have
flown, but that would have been irresponsible on our part,'' Conley
said.
   ``It was really an issue of job security,'' he said. ``When the
deal starts going sour, they don't go back to the banks to
renegotiate the financing. The first thing they do is lop heads.''

   The stock market staged a broad advance today,
extending its recovery from the ``Friday the 13th massacre'' with
encouragement from better-than-expected inflation news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.39 to
2,660.04 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 802 up, 237
down and 407 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.83 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   After taking a 190.58-point tumble last Friday, the Dow Jones
industrials recovered 73.39 points over this week's first three
sessions.
   The average got an added lift today when the Labor Department
reported that the consumer price index rose just 0.2 percent in
September.
   The increase was about half of what had been expected, given a
marked upswing in the producer price index of finished goods
reported last week for September.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets in response to the
news. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, rose about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph led the active list, up { at 43.
The company reported third-quarter earnings of 65 cents a share, up
from 55 cents in the like period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.15 to 190.47. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.74 at 379.81.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.92 to
2,643.65.
   Big Board volume slowed to 166.90 million shares from 224.07
million Tuesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 822 up, 668 down and
461 unchanged.

<HEAD>BAT Shareholders Approve Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 10th graf, beginning `BAT's shares ...' to CORRECT stock
price.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC's shareholders, as expected,
today approved a major, defensive restructuring planned by the
British conglomerate, including the sale of all its U.S. retailing
operations.
   BAT's plan is aimed at increasing shareholder value in an
attempt to thwart a hostile, all-paper $21 billion bid from an
investor group led by Sir James Goldsmith.
   The purchase would be the world's second largest takeover behind
the $25 billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. completed earlier
this year.
   BAT is the world's biggest tobacco company and has substantial
operations in retailing _ such as the Saks Fifth Avenue and
Marshall Field chains in the United States _ paper and financial
services.
   BAT's shareholders cast their vote at a special shareholders
meeting held in London. BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said more than
99 percent of the votes favored the plan.
   Goldsmith previously said his bidding group Hoylake Investments
Ltd. would vote in favor of the BAT plan, calling it ``a first
step'' in the ``unbundling'' of the conglomerate which he has
proposed.
   Goldsmith, who wants to sell off all of BAT's non-tobacco
interests, has said he intends to pursue a takeover of BAT.
   Hoylake's offer of $13.96 worth of securities for each BAT share
has been suspended while the bidders seek approval from U.S. state
insurance commissioners to change the ownership of BAT's Farmers
Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles. That could take months.
   Hoylake held between 2 percent and 3 percent of BAT's shares at
the last announced count.
   BAT's shares were up the equivalent of 52 cents at $12.55 on
London's Stock Exchange after the voting results were announced.
The stock has been seesawing during the recent stock market turmoil
and on concerns about what effect Wednesday's disastrous Northern
California earthquake might have on Farmers.
   Company spokesman Michael Prideaux said Wednesday that the stock
market's recent gyrations would not change BAT's restructuring
plans, which he characterized as long-term.
   BAT intends to sell off its U.S. retailing interests and divest
its paper companies and British retailing interests to existing BAT
shareholders. It plans to retain its tobacco and financial services
businesses.
   BAT also intends to buy back 10 percent of its stock and boost
its dividend by 50 percent.
   These moves are intended to enhance BAT's share value. The
company's critics have complained that BAT's share price has been
depressed by the relative slow growth of its tobacco interests.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. today
announced a 19 percent gain in third-quarter earnings and said it
was sweetening its pension program to lure thousands of managers
into early retirement.
   While AT&amp;T is not aiming to eliminate a specified number of
jobs, spokesman Burke Stinson said, ``It would not be unreasonable
for 5,000 to 15,000 managers to take advantage of the plan.''
   AT&amp;T will double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to
retire with immediate pension payments. It also offered a special
sweetened pension plan for managers who choose to retire on Dec. 30.
   AT&amp;T embarked on an aggressive cost-cutting program beginning in
1984, the year it lost its local operating companies in the breakup
of the Bell System.
   Since then the company has cut its payroll from 373,000 to
298,000. This is the first program aimed only at managers.
   The largest single job cut in the company's history came in late
1986, when AT&amp;T eliminated 32,000 jobs. The company has relied on
incentives when slashing employment, but Stinson noted that this is
the first ``pension sweetener'' in AT&amp;T history.
   ``We are in a topsy-turvy marketplace, and we need to have as
many people at the elbows of our customers as possible and as few
people in non-sales, behind-the-scenes jobs as possible,'' Stinson
said.
   The retirement option will increase expenses in the fourth
quarter, but the amount cannot be determined until the number of
participants is determined. The company said the higher expenses
would be offset by other items, including a gain from a share
exchange that ends its direct investment in Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co.
SpA.
   AT&amp;T reported profits rose 19 percent to $699 million, or 65
cents a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $587 million, or
55 cents a share a year ago. Revenue increased 1 percent to $8.9
billion from $8.81 billion in the third quarter a year ago.
   AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen said that while the company is
pleased with the results, ``we are keenly aware that we face stiff
competition in all our markets.''
   He said AT&amp;T will ``continue to be aggressive in the marketing
of our products and services, and aggressive as well in continuing
to drive costs out of every part of our business.''
   For the nine-month period, profit totaled $1.99 billion, or
$1.85 a share, up 19 percent from $1.67 billion, or $1.56 a share,
a year ago. Revenue increased 3 percent to $26.81 billion, from
$26.00 billion in the year-ago period.

   The nation's stock markets have shrugged off the
deadly California earthquake and traders even found it created
buying opportunities in certain stocks.
   Construction contractors and computer disaster-recovery services
were among the companies that saw their stock prices jacked up
Wednesday by investors in search of quake-related profits.
   Even some insurance stocks rose after analysts said the quake
could stimulate insurers to raise rates and improve the industry's
profitability.
   By today the California quake was mostly forgotten on Wall
Street as stocks rallied in response to a fresh piece of news: an
unexpected slowdown of inflation. The Labor Department said today
that consumer prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in September.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 23.56
points at 2,667.21 at 11 a.m. EDT as advancing issues outnumbered
declining ones by a 3-to-1 margin on the New York Stock Exchange.
   On Wednesday, the first session after the California quake, the
Dow Jones average ended the day up 4.92 to 2,643.65 in the calmest
trading since last Friday's 190-point plunge. The only
quake-related jitters came in the opening moments.
   Most companies with headquarters in San Francisco and the nearby
Silicon Valley were unscathed by the market. Even the phone and
utility companies suffered only small declines on Wall Street, as
analysts concluded damage to them was less than feared. The Diablo
Canyon nuclear power plants of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. were
reported to be unharmed.
   One big gainer from the quake was Kasler Corp., a road and
bridge builder based in San Bernardino, Calif., whose stock rose
almost 30 percent.
   ``Obviously one has to assume that the amount of construction
work that's going to be necessary out there is enormous. Kasler is
one of those that should see a good increase in business,'' said
Richard Rossi, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   He added, ``I hate to use the word `good' in such a tragedy.''
   The earthquake cut power to the San Francisco floor of the
Pacific Stock Exchange, where some traders continued to work by
candlelight, but trading in stock options had to be suspended. The
Securities and Exchange Commission late Wednesday approved a plan
to shift trading in those options temporarily to exchanges in New
York, Philadelphia and Chicago.
   The biggest declines from the quake actually came overseas on
the Australian and New Zealand markets, which close before New York
opens for business. Traders there sold partly out of fear that the
quake might sink the U.S. stock markets.
   The bigger foreign markets reacted more calmly. Key indexes
gained about 0.3 percent in Tokyo and 1.6 percent in London, where
trading overlaps with the U.S. trading day.

   Whitbread and Co. said Wednesday it would sell its
distilled spirits division and concentrate on brewing and marketing
beer and running hotels and restaurants.
   Whitbread, one of Britain's biggest brewers, said Wednesday it
plans to sell its James Burrough Distillers unit, whose brands
include Laphroaig malt whiskey and Beefeater gin.
   It also intends to dispose of its Atlas Peak vineyards in
California and its U.S. distribution arm, Buckingham Wile, which
sells Cutty Sark Scotch whisky, officials said.
   The company said it hoped to complete the sales by February.
   Whitbread declined to estimate how much it hoped to earn from
the sales, but industry analysts predicted Whitbread would pick up
as much as 500 million pounds, or $800 million.
   Whitbread last month agreed to buy the brewing interests of
Boddington Group PLC. It also has been investing heavily in
restaurant chains, including Pizza Hut and Beefeater Steak houses
in Europe.

<HEAD>Corn and Soybeans Surge On Snow and Soviet Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices surged in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid talk of a large
corn purchase by the Soviet Union and forecasts for
harvest-stopping snow in the Midwest.
   Wheat futures were mostly higher, supported by the Agriculture
Department's confirmation that Egypt had bought 55,000 metric tons
of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Traders said there were strong indications the Soviets had
bought as much as 2 million metric tons of U.S. corn overnight.
   Snow accumulations of up to six inches were forecast for today
and tonight in the central Corn Belt, which could temporarily bring
harvesting activity to a standstill.
   The corn and soybean harvest has been largely unhampered by

   Stock prices advanced broadly today, extending
their recovery from the ``Friday the 13th massacre'' with
encouragement from better-than-expected inflation news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 31.35 points to
2,675.00 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,078 up,
312 down and 419 unchanged.
   After taking a 190.58-point tumble last Friday, the Dow Jones
industrials recovered 73.39 points over this week's first three
sessions.
   The average got an added lift today when the Labor Department
reported that the consumer price index rose just 0.2 percent in
September.
   The increase was about half of what had been expected, given a
marked upswing in the producer price index of finished goods
reported last week for September.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets in response to the
news. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, rose about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 7.98 percent-8.05
percent range.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose ~ to 43] in active trading.
The company reported third-quarter earnings of 65 cents a share, up
from 55 cents in the like period last year.
   International Business Machines, which authorized an additional
$1 billion in repurchases of its stock, added 2| to 104].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 2.09 to 191.41. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 3.35 at 381.42.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 91.98 million shares at
noontime, against 85.44 million at the same point Wednesday.

million, or 17 cents a share, the company said.
   Greer would not specify the percentage increase in overseas
sales, but he said foreign sales accounted for about 45 percent of
total sales in the period.
   For the first nine months, net income increased 7.9 percent to
$952 million, or $4.29 a share. That compared with $882 million, or
$3.88 a share, in the same period last year. Sales for the first
nine months increased 5.4 percent to $9.36 billion, 3M said.
   Allen F. Jacobson, chairman and chief executive officer, said
results for the quarter benefited from higher profits in the
Information and Imaging Technologies Sector, which makes
videotapes, diskettes and X-ray film.
   He also said the company has just completed its seventh
consecutive quarter of double-digit volume gains abroad.
   Reflecting the slowing of U.S. economic growth, 3M's domestic
unit volume increased only 3 percent over the same quarter last
year, Jacobson said.
   The sluggishness was most evident in 3M's Industrial and
Electronic Sector, which makes tapes, sandpaper and cleaning
materials, he said.
   The company still expects higher full-year sales and profits,
but earnings in the fourth quarter will continue to be affected by
U.S. economic slowing and negative currency effects, Jacobson said.

<TEXT>
   Consumer prices in September rose an
unexpectedly modest 0.2 percent, with most prices virtually
unchanged except for a sharp rise in clothing costs, the government
said today.
   Energy prices, which had climbed sharply at the wholesale level,
raising the expectation of an increase on the retail level, fell
for the fourth consecutive month in September, the Labor Department
said.
   Jittery stock and bond markets rallied on the news, taking the
favorable inflation number as a sign the Federal Reserve Board has
leeway to nudge interest rates lower. At noon EDT, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 31.35 points to 2,675.00.
   Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser to President Bush, called
the data ``good economic news.'' He added: ``We're delighted to be
able to say that, while we're always on guard to make sure that
inflation remains under control, the concern earlier in the year
that inflation was getting out of control appears to have been
unfounded.''
   Also, the report triggered an announcement that the nation's
38.9 million Social Security recipients will get a 4.7 percent
benefit increase in January to offset the effects of inflation over
the past year.
   The cost-of-living increase is determined by comparing the
Consumer Price Index in the July-September quarter with the same
period of last year.
   The average recipient will see his or her benefits increased by
$25 a month to $566.
   At the same time, the cap on Social Security payroll taxes will
rise. Workers will have to pay the tax on their first $50,400 in
wages, up from $48,000.
   Meanwhile, in a separate report, the department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose 0.3
percent in September following a 0.7 percent decline in August.
   Average weekly earnings in September were $338.67, up 3.5
percent from a year earlier. But, when inflation is taken into
account, real weekly earnings were down.
   Consumer prices rose at a high annual rate of 6.7 percent for
the first five months of the year, driven up by rising gasoline
prices.
   However, the index has risen only 0.2 percent or remained flat
in each of the last four months, bringing the annual rate down to
4.4 percent for the first three quarters, the same as the rate for
all of 1988 and 1987.
   ``This shows clearly that inflation is under control. ... Under
these circumstances, there is no question that interest rates will
fall,'' said economist William K. MacReynolds of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce.
   But, economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago
said the September report overstates the decline in inflation and
warned of higher energy prices ahead.
   ``There has been an abatment, but it hasn't been to the degree
this number would suggest. We're likely to have some less
attractive numbers in the fourth quarter,'' he said.
   Gasoline prices, down 2.2 percent in September, have declined
9.3 percent in the past four months after increasing 21.2 percent
in the first five months of the year.
   Fuel oil prices fell 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.9
percent in August.
   However, analysts don't expect the trend to persist because
crude oil prices have been rising.
   Food prices, which were surging earlier in the year, rose a
moderate 0.2 percent last month, in part because of a 1.1 percent
decline for fruits and vegetables.
   Food and beverage prices, which shot up at a 9.3 percent annual
rate through May, from June to September climbed at only a 1.7
percent rate.
   Also down last month were coffee, 2.7 percent, and fats and oils
and non-alcoholic beverages.
   However, the index for dairy products jumped 1.4 percent, the
largest monthly increase since May 1980.
   Clothing prices, after falling in the three previous months,
rose 1.7 percent in September. Apparel for women and girls,
reflecting the introduction of new fall and winter fashions, were
up 3.6 percent.
   The various changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at
125.0 in September, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods
and services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period would have
cost $125 last month.
   The Social Security benefit increase is based on a narrower
index that reflects costs for urban wage earners and clerical
workers. That index was 123.6.
   In advance of the report, most economists were expecting an
inflation figure approximately double the 0.2 percent reported in
September.
   The more modest rise may provide room for the Federal Reserve
Board to reduce interest rates. The central bank has been fighting
inflation by trying to slow the economy with higher interest rates.
   In response to the stock market gyrations, the central bank this
week has allowed the interest rate for overnight loans between
banks to decline about one-quarter percentage point to 8.75 percent.
   With today's inflation number, most analysts now believe the Fed
will allow the rate to fall further, or at least refrain from
pushing it back up once market turmoil has subsided.
   In another report emphasizing the economy's softness, the Labor
Department said new state unemployment claims for the week ending
Oct. 7 increased 62,000 from the previous week to 396,000.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Expands Early Retirement Offer; Reports Profit Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. on Thursday
announced a 19 percent gain in third-quarter earnings and announced
incentives that could lead 5,000 to 15,000 managers to take early
retirement.
   Meanwhile, Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. reported a 6.5
percent quarterly profit increase and Denver-based U S West Inc.
said its profit fell 8.9 percent.
   While AT&amp;T said it is not aiming to eliminate a specified number
of jobs, spokesman Burke Stinson said, ``It would not be
unreasonable for 5,000 to 15,000 managers to take advantage of the
plan.''
   Analysts praised AT&amp;T's cost-cutting step, saying the company
has too many managers in light of its sluggish sales of computers
and network equipment.
   ``They're doing exactly what I think they need to do,'' said Lap
Lee, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst.
   AT&amp;T will double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to
retire with immediate pension payments. It is also offering a
special sweetened pension plan for managers who choose to retire on
Dec. 30.
   AT&amp;T embarked on an aggressive cost-cutting program beginning in
1984, the year it lost its local operating companies in the breakup
of the Bell System.
   Since then the company has cut its payroll from 373,000 to
298,000. This is the first program aimed only at managers.
   The largest single job cut in the company's history came in late
1986, when AT&amp;T eliminated 32,000 jobs. The company has relied on
incentives when slashing employment, but Stinson noted that this is
the first ``pension sweetener'' in AT&amp;T history.
   ``We are in a topsy-turvy marketplace, and we need to have as
many people at the elbows of our customers as possible and as few
people in non-sales, behind-the-scenes jobs as possible,'' Stinson
said.
   The retirement option will increase expenses in the fourth
quarter, but the amount cannot be determined until the number of
participants is determined. The company said the higher expenses
would be offset by other items, including a gain from a share
exchange that ends its direct investment in Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co.
SpA.
   AT&amp;T reported profits rose 19 percent to $699 million, or 65
cents a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $587 million, or
55 cents a share a year ago. Revenue increased 1 percent to $8.9
billion from $8.81 billion in the third quarter a year ago.
   For the nine-month period, profit totaled $1.99 billion, or
$1.85 a share, up 19 percent from $1.67 billion, or $1.56 a share,
a year ago. Revenue increased 3 percent to $26.81 billion, from
$26.00 billion in the year-ago period.
   AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen said that while the company is
pleased with the results, ``we are keenly aware that we face stiff
competition in all our markets.''
   He said AT&amp;T will ``continue to be aggressive in the marketing
of our products and services, and aggressive as well in continuing
to drive costs out of every part of our business.''
   Bell Atlantic and U S West, two of the companies carved out of
AT&amp;T in the 1984 breakup, reported differing results. Bell Atlantic
attributed its gains partly to strong growth in telephone usage,
while U S West said its profit dip was the result of special
factors that masked ``modest earnings growth.''
   Bell Atlantic said its profit rose to $363.2 million, or $1.82 a
share, from $341 million, or $1.02 a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose to $2.91 billion from $2.76 billion.
   For the first nine months, Bell Atlantic said profit rose to
$1.07 billion, or $5.43 a share, from $1.01 billion, or $5.12 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $8.56 billion from $7.69
billion.
   U S West said profit fell to $258.1 million, or $1.39 a share,
from $283.2 million, or $1.55 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell
to $2.32 billion from $2.43 billion.
   ``Nevertheless, we're not satisfied with these results. The
major negative factor is the cumulative impact of regulatory
activity over the past two years on our telephone operations,''
said Jack McAllister, U S West's chairman and chief executive.
   For the year to date, U S West said earnings fell to $766.3
million, or $4.17 a share, from $860 million, or $4.68 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $7.15 billion from $6.87 billion a
year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Harley-Davidson Inc. says a stock-purchase
offer from a Rochester, N.Y.-based group should be halted, saying
it may be just an attempt to drive the stock price higher so the
investors can sell out at a profit.
   Harley, the only major U.S. manufacturer of motorcycles, filed
suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court against Malcolm L. Glazer,
whose investment firm also owns 6 percent of the Milwaukee
company's stock.
   Glazer, three of his companies and his six children violated
rules of the Securities Exchange Act, the suit said.
   Glazero heads an investor group based in Rochester, N.Y. He has
announced Oct. 2 that the group had acquired 6.24 percent of Harley
stock and was thinking of expanding the share to 15 percent.
   Harley requested a Federal Trade Commission investigation,
arguing Glazer did not give it the required written notice of the
filing and did not get the required advance clearance for spending
more than $15 million to acquire Harley stock.
   The suit asks that Judge Terence T. Evans enjoin Glazer from
acquiring more Harley stock or voting on any of the company's
securities, and force Glazer to divest of Harley stock.

<TEXT>
   Toy company Hasbro Inc. on Thursday said
better profit margins and improved performances by its Milton
Bradley and Playskool units helped third-quarter earnings rise 73
percent.
   The company reported earnings of $31.3 million, or 53 cents per
share, compared with $18.08 million, or 31 cents a share, in 1988's
third quarter. Revenue rose 9.4 percent to $403 million in the
quarter ended Sept. 30 from $368.4 million a year earlier.
   ``As anticipated, our third quarter gross profit margin improved
from that of the second quarter,'' said Alan G. Hassenfeld,
chairman and chief executive.
   Along with better revenue by Milton Bradley and Playskool, which
concentrates on toys for infants and young children, international
operations showed improvement, despite being hurt by a strong
dollar, Hassenfeld said.
   Analysts had said the Milton Bradley unit's board games could
take a beating from video games.
   Hasbro recently bought many of the products formerly
manufactured by Coleco Industries Inc., including Cabbage Patch
dolls, Scrabble and Parcheesi.
   These additions plus a new line of battery powered racing cars
called Record Breakers places Hasbro in a good position to enter
the Christmas buying season, Hassenfeld said.
   For the first nine months of this year, Hasbro earned $68.2
million, or $1.15 a share, up nearly 33 percent from $51.3 million,
or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $992.7
million, about 3 percent higher than $962.9 million in 1988.

<HEAD>Caterpillar Earnings Plunge 43 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc.'s third-quarter earnings
tumbled 43 percent because of a sales slump that has forced the
company to place about 325 employees on indefinite layoff, the firm
said Thursday.
   Plants in East Peoria, Mossville and Mapleton, Ill. would be
affected, but Caterpillar, a major manufacturer of earth-moving
equipment, did not announce how many workers at each plant would be
idled.
   Caterpillar also said a plant in York, Pa. would shut down
operations involving about 175 workers for a total of four weeks in
November and December.
   The layoffs are necessary ``to keep production in line with
demand,'' the company said in a statement.
   The York plant employs 2,200 people, while in the area of
Illinois affected by layoffs, there are 10,500 production workers,
said company spokesman R.E. Stober.
   Caterpillar blamed its sales decline in part on higher interest
rates, which led to reduced construction activity and discouraged
purchases of replacement equipment, particularly in the housing
sector.
   Caterpillar said it earned $108 million, or $1.07 per share, for
the three months ended Sept. 30, compared to $190 million, or $1.87
per share, for the same period a year ago.
   Revenue fell 5 percent to $2.64 billion from $2.79 billion as
equipment sales declined 6 percent to $2.58 billion from $2.74
billion.
   The company said its earnings also reflected an $11 million
provision for bad debts on Latin American receivables.
   For the first nine months, Caterpillar reported net income of
$390 million, or $3.85 per share, down 14 percent from $453
million, or $4.46 per share, a year ago.
   Revenue for the first three quarters rose 8 percent to $8.36
billion from $7.77 billion.

   W.R. Grace &amp; Co. said Thursday its third-quarter
profit nearly doubled because of a large gain on the restructuring
of its energy operations.
   Grace, whose main business is specialty chemicals but which also
has interests in manufacturing and health care services, said it
earned $97.9 million, or $1.15 a share, in the three months ended
Sept. 30, up 93.7 percent from $50.5 million, or 60 cents a share,
a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 7 percent to $1.49 billion from $1.39
billion a year earlier.
   The latest results included a pretax gain of $114.4 million
resulting from the energy operations restructuring. That included
the sale of Grace Equipment Co., an initial public offering in
Grace Energy Corp. and an adjustment in the carrying value of
natural resource assts.
   The latest results were also depressed by higher interest
expenses and an accrual for stock appreciation rights.
   In its specialty chemicals business, Grace said reported
operating income after taxes of $59 million for the quarter,
slightly ahead of 1988 results.
   Operating income for the quarter rose 22 percent to $9.2 million
in natural resoruces, fell 14 percent to $7.6 million in health
care and dropped 29.6 percent in specialty businesses to $8.8
million due to absence of a $4.6 million gain a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of the year, Grace earned $171.4
million, or $2.01 a share, up 8.4 percent from $158.1 million, or
$1.87 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 6.3 percent to $4.4 billion for the nine months
from $4.13 billion a year earlier.

   American Express Co. Thursday said its
third-quarter profit grew 21 percent, helped by record income from
three of its five operating units, including the unit handling its
Travelers Cheques and charge cards.
   The travel and financial services giant earned $331.8 million,
or 77 cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, up from
$273.9 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 24 percent to $6.5 billion from $5.23 billion in
1988's third quarter.
   James D. Robinson III, chairman and chief executive officer of
American Express, said the results demonstrated the company's
``ability to take advantage of shifts in consumer spending and
savings patterns.''
   He said in a news release that the earnings growth was paced by
record income from the Travel and Related Services division, which
includes travelers checks and charge cards; IDS Financial Services,
a financial planning business; and American Express Information
Services Co.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton, mostly owned by American Express,
reported income of $66 million for the quarter, boosted by
after-tax proceeds from the sale of the institutional money
management business of Lehman Management Co. American Express'
share of Shearson Lehman's third-quarter income was $41 million.
   In last year's third quarter Shearson Lehman lost $7.1 million.
   The American Express Bank, which generally operates outside the
United States, was the only operating unit to post a decline in
earnings for the quarter when it added $110 million to its reserve
against possible losses on Third World loans.
   For the first nine months of the year, American Express reported
income of $899.8 million, or $2.09 a share, up 11.4 percent from
$807.5 million, or $1.89 a share, in the first three quarters of
1988. Revenue rose 24.1 percent to $18.73 billion from $15.09
billion.

   Stock prices rose sharply today, extending their
recovery from the ``Friday the 13th massacre'' with encouragement
from better-than-expected inflation news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 43.24 points to
2,686.89 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,155 up, 329 down
and 405 unchanged.
   After taking a 190.58-point tumble last Friday, the Dow Jones
industrials recovered 73.39 points over this week's first three
sessions.
   The average got an added lift today when the Labor Department
reported that the consumer price index rose just 0.2 percent in
September.
   The increase was about half of what had been expected, given a
marked upswing in the producer price index of finished goods
reported last week for September.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets in response to the
news. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, rose about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 7.98 percent-8.05
percent range.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose ~ to 43] in active trading.
The company reported third-quarter earnings of 65 cents a share, up
from 55 cents in the like period last year.
   International Business Machines, which authorized an additional
$1 billion in repurchases of its stock, gained 3[ to 104~.
   American Medical International was up 1~ at 23|. An investor
group said it obtained bank financing for a $26.50-a-share buyout
of AMI.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 2.82 to 192.14. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 4.19 at 382.26.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 137.28 million shares with two

<HEAD>Shareholders Vote For BAT Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC shareholders overwhelmingly
approved a major restructuring Thursday that includes the sale of
the conglomerate's U.S. retailing businesses and is aimed at
thwarting a $21 billion hostile takeover.
   Among shares voting for the restructuring, in which BAT hopes to
bolster its stock value by concentrating on its tobacco and
financial interests, were those controlled by the takeover group
led by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith.
   BAT also plans to buy back up to 10 percent of its outstanding
stock, or 153 million shares. Shortly after the midday vote at a
special shareholders meeting announced it had bought 2.5 million
shares at the equivalent of $12.48 a share from the brokerage
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd.
   BAT's shares rose the equivalent of 43 cents to $12.52 a share
Thursday on London's Stock Exchange.
   The Goldsmith group, Hoylake Investments Ltd., and its
associates controlled between 2 percent and 3 percent of BAT's
shares at the last announced count.
   A spokesman for Goldsmith, who was not identified, said by
telephone, ``We voted for it, as we said we would.''
   The restructuring was favored by 99 percent of the shareholder
votes cast, said BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy.
   BAT plans to retain its tobacco and financial services
businesses and sell its U.S. retailing interests, which include
Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field stores. It also plans to spin
off its paper companies and British retailing interests to existing
BAT shareholders and to boost its dividend by 50 percent.
   BAT said it would keep acquiring shares under its buyback plan,
subject to price, availability and market conditions, up to the
close of business on Friday. After then, BAT may not buy more
shares until it has released its third-quarter results on Nov. 22.
   ``We will proceed as speedily as possible and in light of market
conditions,'' Sheehy told shareholders.
   There was concern that the recent stock market turmoil following
the Friday the 13th plunge on Wall Street and the large number of
U.S. retailing properties on the block might make it difficult for
BAT to sell pieces at a good price and might delay the
restructuring.
   ``We are determined to get a good price for them,'' Sheehy said.
``We are not in any hurry to sell them.''
   Sheehy said BAT already had intended to change its strategy of
diversifying slowly away from tobacco, and Goldsmith's bid prompted
a ``significant acceleration.''
   Hoylake wants to sell off all BAT's non-tobacco interests and
says it will continue pursuing its bid despite the restructuring.
   BAT's critics have complained the relative slow growth of the
tobacco businesses has depressed the market value of BAT's shares.
   But Sheehy said tobacco offers steady earnings and good cash
flow, while financial services offer faster growth. These
businesses represent 80 percent of BAT's forecast pre-tax profit
for 1989.
   There was no sign of Goldsmith at the shareholders meeting. The
Anglo-French financier previously said Hoylake would vote for the
restructuring, calling it a first step in his hoped-for
``unbundling'' of the conglomerate.
   Hoylake's bid of $13.96 worth of securities for each BAT share
has been suspended while it seeks approval from U.S. state
insurance commissioners to change the ownership of BAT's Farmers
Insurance Group Inc.
   Sheehy said he didn't expect Farmers' profit to be hurt by
Tuesday's disastrous Northern California earthquake.

<HEAD>Textron Blames Sagging Auto, Aerospace Markets for Lower Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textron Inc. reported Thursday that
higher costs in its aerospace and auto products businesses
contributed to a 5.5 percent drop in the conglomerate's
third-quarter earnings.
   Textron said it earned $59.5 million, or 66 cents per share, in
the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with 1988 third-quarter
results of $62.8 million, or 72 cents per share.
   Revenue increased to $1.73 billion from $1.72 billion a year
earlier.
   Textron's aerospace business was especially hard hit by cost
increases in its fixed-price contracts to develop the V22 Osprey
tilt-rotor aircraft with Boeing Helicopter Co., said spokesman
Raymond W. Caine Jr.
   The Defense Department has canceled that program, but Textron is
attempting to persuade Congress to restore funding, he said.
   Overall aerospace segment revenue fell nearly 10 percent to $756
million, and earnings in that division were down almost 17 percent
to $65.6 million.
   Textron's commercial products segment, which includes its
automotive businesses, posted a $41 million increase in revenue to
$434 million but earnings decreased from $33 million to $27 million.
   Caine said he was unable to pinpoint one reason for the softer
margins in that segment. ``It's just a question of the costs were
higher than we thought they would be,'' he said.
   Textron's financial services sector saw earnings increase 25
percent to $69 million because of strength in consumer finance and
insurance businesses, Caine said.
   For the first nine months of the year, Textron said it earned
$182.1 million, or $2.17 a share, compared with $170.4 million, or
$2.27 a share, a year earlier. Textron had more shares outstanding
a year ago.
   Revenue for the first three quarters increased to $5.41 billion
from $5.3 billion.

<HEAD>Bristol-Myers, Squibb Announce Higher Third-Quarter Profit Before
Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly merged Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Thursday
said its two predecessor companies had a combined 16 percent
increase in their third-quarter profits.
   Combined earnings of the two drug manufacturers, which completed
a merger earlier this month, rose to $410.7 million, or 78 cents a
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, up from $355.3 million,
or 68 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Combined revenue totaled $2.3 billion, up 6 percent from $2.2
billion in the same 1988 period.
   Richard L. Gelb, chairman of the new company, noted that the
third quarter was the last period preceding the merger between
Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp.
   The deal was finalized earlier this month after stockholders
approved an $11.5 billion tax-free stock swap between the two
companies, creating the second largest pharmaceutical concern
behind Merck &amp; Co.
   Bristol-Myers, with headquarters in New York, makes Excedrin and
Bufferin pain relievers, household products and numerous
prescription medicines. Squibb, based in Princeton, makes and
markets a wide variety of prescription drugs and has an extensive
research and development operation.
   For the first nine months on a pro-forma basis, combined net
income rose 14.4 percent to $1.1 billion, or $2.10 a share, from
$961.5 million, or $1.83 a share, in the same 1988 period. Combined
sales totaled $6.8 billion, up 6.5 percent from $6.4 billion during
the same period last year.
   The new company said each of its predecessors had record sales
and earnings for the third quarter.
   Bristol-Myers' profit climbed 15 percent in the period to $266.2
million, or 93 cents a share, from $232.3 million, or 81 cents a
share, in the comparable 1988 quarter. Revenue totaled $1.6
billion, up 5 percent from $1.5 billion a year ago.
   Nine-month profits were $715.9 million, or $2.49 a share, up 13
percent from $633.5 million in the comparable 1988 period. Sales
grew 5 percent to $4.7 billion from $4.5 billion.
   Squibb's third-quarter net income rose 17 percent to $144.5
million, or $1.47 a share, from $123 million, or $1.25 a share,
while sales showed a 7.5 percent gain to $730 million from $679.5
million.
   Nine-month net earnings totaled $383.6 million, or $3.92 a
share, up 17 percent from $328 million, or $3.30 a share, in the
year-ago period. Squibb's revenue reached $2 billion, 10 percent
higher than $1.9 billion reported in the comparable 1988 period.
   Both companies reported stronger domestic sales as well as
improved international revenue, despite the negative impact of
exchange-rate fluctuations.

<HEAD>Mattel's Income Up 73 Percent</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Mattel Inc. Thursday reported a 73 percent gain in third-quarter
earnings and said sales grew by about a third thanks to strong
performances by Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels and other toys.
   The toy company announced after-tax income of $38 million in the
third quarter compared to $21.9 million a year earlier. Sales rose
34 percent to $410 million from $306.6 million in 1988's third
quarter.
   Quarterly earnings per share of 76 cents in the three months
ended Sept. 30 exceeded per-share earnings for all of 1988. In the
third quarter of last year, per-share earnings came to 45 cents.
   John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company's double-digit growth occurred despite lackluster
sales industrywide.
   ``Worldwide retail trade and consumer sales for Barbie, Hot
Wheels Disney Infant and Preschool toys, and products introduced in
1989 remain very strong,'' said John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman
and chief executive officer.
   ``The prospects for a strong fourth quarter are good,'' Amerman
said.
   Mattel earned $58.9 million, or $1.19 a share, through the first
nine months of 1989, up 32 percent from $25.4 million, or 53 cents
a share, during three quarters of last year.
   Nine-month revenue rose 25 percent to $877.6 million from $702.4
million.
   Mattel currently is based in Hawthorne, Calif. but it plans to
move to a new headquarters building in El Segundo by the end of
1990.

<HEAD>BankAmerica Enjoys Earnings Surge; Bank of Boston Takes Big Hit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp. reported a 34 percent rise in third-quarter
earnings Thursday on the strength of its basic money-lending
business, while across the continent the Bank of Boston reported a
$125.1 million loss related to an increased reserve for bad loans.
   Analysts said BankAmerica's results reflected a remarkable
turnaround at the nation's second-biggest banking company behind
Citicorp. Only a few years ago BankAmerica was wallowing in heavy
losses.
   The Bank of Boston results underscored growing economic problems
in once-thriving New England, which has put pressure on many banks
that have lent money aggressively in that region.
   San Francisco-based BankAmerica said it earned $254 million or
$1.16 a share in the three months ended Sept. 30, vs. $190 million
or 97 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. The bank had an
average of 201.49 million shares outstanding in the 1989
third-quarter vs. 178.91 million a year earlier.
   Combined net interest income and non-interest income totaled
$1.47 billion, a 19.5 percent increase over $1.23 billion a year
earlier.
   ``The quarter's results reflect continued strong performance in
the fundamental areas of our business, particularly growth in
consumer and residential mortgage loans,'' said BankAmerica
Chairman A.W. Clausen. ``Net credit losses were low during the
quarter, capital and reserve levels increased, and expenses
continued to be effectively controlled.''
   For the nine months, BankAmerica earned $833 million or $4.07 a
share, an 81 percent increase over the $461 million or $2.40 a
share earned a year earlier. The bank had an average of 194.56
million shares outstanding in the first three quarters of 1989 vs.
172.19 million a year earlier.
   Combined net interest income and non-interest income for the
nine months totaled $4.36 billion, an 18.2 percent increase over
$3.69 billion a year earlier.
   At the Bank of Boston, the nation's 14th-largest banking
concern, the third-quarter loss totaled $125.1 million or a
per-share loss of $1.82, compared with earnings of $79.2 million or
$1.14 a share a year earlier. The bank's average shares outstanding
in the quarter totaled 78.68 million vs. 66.34 million.
   Combined net interest income and non-interest income for the
third quarter totaled $430.6 million, a 5.4 percent decrease over
the $455.3 million a year earlier.
   Ira Stepanian, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
results reflected the bank's previously announced $370 million
addition to its reserve for possibly bad loans, due largely to a
weakening real estate market.
   For the nine months, the bank earned $61.8 million or 73 cents a
share, a 74 percent decline over the $239.6 million or $3.47 a
share earned a year earlier. Average shares outstanding totaled
70.21 million vs. 65.92 million.
   Combined net interest income and non-interest income for the
nine months totaled $1.39 billion vs. $1.35 billion, a 2.9 percent
gain.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Rise Sharply On Signs Of Soviet Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Signs of a large Soviet purchase of U.S. corn
pulled corn futures prices up sharply Thursday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, and the other grain markets rallied in kind.
   ``It looks like Russia bought another 2 million (metric tons) of
corn overnight and I believe it's true,'' said Gerald Zusel,
manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor operations at the
exchange.
   He cited heavy buying of futures by grain exporters, which
frequently signals a large foreign purchase.
   Rumors of Soviet buying of U.S. soybeans and soybean meal gave
those markets an additional boost and wheat futures gained on a
spillover of the bullish enthusiasm.
   Snow accumulations of up to six inches were expected overnight
in the eastern Corn Belt, which would bring harvesting activity to
a halt. But Zusel said forecasts for mild weekend temperatures and
drier-than-normal conditions in the Midwest next week minimized
chances of significant harvest delays.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 1{ cents higher with
December at $4.07} a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 5} cents higher
with December at $2.44 a bushel; oats were { cent to 1} cents
higher with December at $1.46 a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 9
cents higher with November at $5.66} a bushel.

<DATELINE>OLD GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Brands Inc. today reported
its earnings increased 13 percent in the third quarter despite a 2
percent drop in revenue.
   American Brands said it earned $166.4 million, or $1.71 per
share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $146.8 million, or
$1.53 per share, in the third quarter of 1988.
   Revenue declined to $3.06 billion from $3.13 billion. The
company attributed the drop to the sale of its Southland Life
insurance operation in March and to the impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar, which makes the company's products more expensive abroad.
   American Brands Chairman William J. Alley said the company's
core businesses, tobacco, distilled spirits and life insurance, all
performed well during the quarter, with improvements in operating
income.
   The company said operating income was higher from its office
products, hardware and home improvement operations, although
revenue and operating income were lower for specialty business,
including golf products and housewares.
   For the first nine months of the year, American Brands said it
earned $458.8 million, or $4.76 per share, up from $452 million, or
$4.50 per share, in the same period a year ago.
   Revenue for the three quarters rose to $9.03 billion from $8.98
billion a year earlier.
   American Brands' businesses include the American Tobacco Co.;
liquor distilling, with brands including Jim Beam and Gilbey's;
office products, with brands including Swingline; and sporting
goods, including Titleist products. It also owns Franklin life
insurance companies.

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer systems are providing an
electronic lifeline between isolated earthquake victims in San
Francisco and anxious relatives back home.
   CompuServe, a Columbus-based computer information company with
550,000 individual and 1,800 corporate customers worldwide, put an
``earthquake forum'' on line about 5 p.m. EDT Wednesday, said Rich
Baker, manager of editorial services.
   By 11 a.m. Thursday, more than 430 messages _ many seeking
information about relatives and friends living in northern
California _ had been filed.
   ``This is sort of like what ham radio operators do, only it's on
a computer,'' said Baker. ``It's setting a lot of the information
coming out of California straight in an accurate and timely manner
_ often more quickly than the news media can.''
   Another computer information services company, Prodigy, had such
a system operating less than four hours after the earthquake hit,
said communications manager Brian Ek. The company, based in White
Plains, N.Y., launched its service in October 1988 and has
subscribers in more than 100,000 households across the country.
   As of Thursday afternoon, 1,530 messages had been entered, he
said.
   Among the other computer bulletin board services that went into
action after the quake was The Well, which is based in Sausalito,
Calif., and has about two-thirds of its 3,000 subscribers in the
San Francisco Bay area.
   Many of the messages sent through CompuServe have sought
information about things such as road closings, but others were
more personal.
   A New England man trying to find a couple in Burlingame turned
to the computer network for help. About an hour later, he received
word that they not only survived the earthquake but had become
grandparents. He also learned that the mother of one of his friends
had been widowed the day before the earthquake hit.
   Computer samaritans across the country offered to act as
messengers for those who couldn't reach loved ones by phone.
   An Oakland-area woman reported ``for anybody worrying about
their daughter'' at Mills College in Oakland Hills, the students
were shaken but otherwise fine.
   One man from Italy sought help in finding friends vacationing in
San Francisco, but their whereabouts were not known.
   Word also came from Santa Clara that a woman sustained no damage
to her house, but her bird bath was tipped over.
   The CompuServe system is available only to members, who pay
$12.50 an hour to access the electronic billboard through their
personal computers.
   Ek said the messages filed on the Prodigy service have been
similar. But the company took the service, for which subscribers
pay $9.95 a month, a step further.
   The company put a local psychologist on line Wednesday night
``to help these people deal with the trauma. We had one person who
know some of the people involved in the Nimitz highway situation
who was pretty distraught,'' he said.
   Baker said he is not surprised at the offers of help from
stranger to stranger.
   ``This is not uncharacteristic of the on-line computer
community,'' he said. ``We're a tightly knit, caring group of
people. We like to show the human side of personal computing.''

   With damage in the Northern California
earthquake being estimated as high at $1 billion or more, insurance
officials say only five other natural disasters have had higher
dollar price tags.
   Because of inflation, the dollar cost of natural disasters from
earlier times can't be directly compared to the dollar cost of the
Bay Quake.
   The Independent Insurance Agents of America said Thursday that
while the final cost of the San Francisco region quake will not be
known for some time, it will likely top $1 billion.
   Only five other disasters in the United States have had price
tags in excess of that amount, the association reported.
   Those are Hurricane Hugo, with the cleanup still under way but
costs expected to reach $3.98 billion; Hurricane Agnes, 1972, $3
billion; Hurricane Camille, 1969, $1.42 billion; Hurricane Betsy,
1965, $1.4 billion, and the eruption of Mount St. Helens, 1980,
$1.1 billion.
   The next most costly earthquake, the insurance agents reported,
was the 1971 San Fernando quake, where losses were estimated at
$553 million.
   The great San Francisco quake of 1906 caused an estimated $524
million in damage, according to the agents group. In today's
dollars that would be $5 billion to $5.8 billion, the group said.
That is a huge sum considering that San Francisco was a far smaller
city in 1906.

<HEAD>Martin Marietta Posts Adjusted 3rd Quarter Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Marietta Corp. reported its third
quarter earnings declined 57 percent from a year earlier, when it
had a one-time gain from the sale of one of its divisions.
   The aerospace, defense and electronics company said it earned
$87.3 million, or $1.65 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30,
compared to earnings of $202.7 million, or $3.82 per share, in the
same period of 1988.
   In the year-earlier period, Martin Marietta had a one-time
after-tax gain of $135.7 million, from the sale of Hoskyns Group
PLC, a British computer services company.
   Without that gain, its earnings would have risen 30 percent in
the latest quarter.
   Third-quarter revenue slipped to $1.42 billion from $1.45
billion a year ago.
   Martin Marietta Chairman Norman R. Augustine said the latest
period was highlighted by ``improved margins in our two largest
segments, astronautics and electronics and missiles.''
   For the first nine months of 1989, Martin Marietta's profit
totaled $233.4 million, or $4.41 per share, compared to unadjusted
figures of $335.1 million, or $6.30 per share, for the same period
last year.
   Revenue totaled $4.17 billion in the nine months, down from
$4.19 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Funds Rise Sharply to New Record After Big Stock Selloff</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 473 money market mutual
funds surged by $6.07 billion in the latest week to a record
$356.10 billion, reflecting an investor exodus from stocks into
safer investments following the Oct. 13 Wall Street plunge, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   It was the biggest rise in fund assets since the week of another
large decline in stock prices, Jan. 13, 1988, when assets rose by
$7.62 billion.
   The latest rise broke the record total set the previous week,
when fund assets totaled $350.03 billion. The institute originally
reported that figure as $349.37 billion but revised it upward.
   Jacob Dreyer, chief economist and senior vice president of the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group, attributed the latest
rise to investors who sought safe havens for their money after the
stock market dropped sharply Oct. 13, with the Dow Jones industrial
average falling 190 points.
   The biggest weekly rise in funds assets _ $9.64 billion in the
week ended Oct. 21, 1987 _ came during the stock market collapse,
when the Dow average fell a record 508 points in a single session.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 235
general purpose funds rose $2.53 billion to $116.56 billion, assets
of 96 broker-dealer funds increased $1.30 billion to $154.05
billion, and assets of 142 institutional funds rose $2.23 billion
to $85.49 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.21 percent from 8.26 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.26 percent from 8.27 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
38 days, unchanged from the previous week.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.41 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.42 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.10 percent from 5.11 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.22
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.28 the
previous week. Yields were 8.26 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.33 percent; 8.18 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.24 percent;
and 8.16 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.22 percent.

<HEAD>Steelmakers Plan Second Joint Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. and Kobe Steel Ltd. of Japan said
Thursday they plan a joint venture in sheet steel galvanizing for
auto and appliance makers.
   The two companies, as USS-Kobe Steel Co., already share another
joint venture, operating the former USX plant at Lorain, Ohio.
   The new venture is an effort to answer growing demand for
high-quality, coated sheet steel, primarily for domestic and
Japanese automakers in the United States, and other sheet steel
consumers, such as makers of appliances and office furniture.
   The companies hope to reach a definitive agreement by year's end
on a 50-50 equity partnership.
   USX and Kobe plan to jointly design and build a state-of-the-art
plant somewhere in the Midwest to produce 600,000 tons per year.
Construction could begin next spring and production could begin two
years later.
   The steel will be coated by dipping it in molten zinc, a process
once limited to culverts, water pails, garbage cans and other
low-grade uses. Hot-dip galvanizing has become increasingly
sophisticated and now can compete with sheets coated by
electrolysis, or electrogalvanizing, said USX spokesman Tom Farrell.
   Master coils would come from USX plants at Pittsburgh, Gary,
Ind., and Birmingham, Ala. The new plant is not expected to hurt
other USX hot-dipped galvanizing lines.
   The companies said they could not project the number of jobs
that would be created or the cost of the plant.
   USX is the nation's largest steelmaker. Kobe is Japan's
fifth-largest steelmaker.

<HEAD>Agency Intensifies Probe of Faulty Cruise Controls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal engineers have stepped up an
investigation of four Ford Motor Co. models following complaints of
malfunctioning cruise controls, the government said Thursday.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said its
investigation of speed controls in the 1986 and 1987 Ford Tempo and
Mustang and the Mercury Topaz and Capri was being upgraded from a
preliminary evaluation to an engineering analysis.
   The change means engineers will study the potentially defective
parts as opposed to just paperwork analysis.
   The investigations help the agency decide whether to seek
recalls.
   Fifty-five customers have complained that the cruise controls do
not disengage properly, forcing drivers to hit the brakes to slow
the cars, agency spokesman Tim Hurd said. The problem has been
blamed for two accidents and three injuries.
   In Detroit, Ford spokeswoman Joyce Stinson said the company was
investigating the purported defect but had reached no conclusions.
   ``It's always our policy to cooperate fully with NHTSA in their
investigations, and we will do so in this case,'' she said.
   An estimated 562,000 of the 1986-87 Tempos, Mustangs, Topazes
and Capris are on the road, Hurd said.
   The agency also said it was launching several new investigations
and calling off some probes for lack of evidence the public was
endangered.
   NHTSA also upgraded to an engineering analysis its probe of 1985
Toyota vans and cargo vans, of which 104,100 are on the road. There
have been five complaints alleging eight accidents caused by
steering gear failure and resulting loss of control over the
vehicles.
   An engineering analysis of hydraulic fuel leaks in the 1985
Volkswagen Audi 500 was halted despite 663 complaints of hydraulic
fuel leaks causing loss of power steering and brakes.
   Engineers determined the problem is not a safety hazard because
the cars can be controlled with manual brakes and steering, Hurd
said. An estimated 90,000 are on the road.
   The agency opened preliminary evaluations of:
   _Reports that on hard turns, the front wheels of 1987, 1988 and
1989 Chrysler LeBarons rub on something under the car, causing tire
wear. An estimated 600,000 are on the road.
   _Four complaints of locking wheels and steering systems in
180,000 Chevrolet Berettas from 1988, causing two accidents and one
injury.
   _Fractured rear axle shafts in 1.2 million Chevrolet Camaros and
Pontiac Firebirds from the 1982 through 1988 model years. Six
accidents and three injuries have been reported.
   _Alleged transmission oil leaks in the 1988-89 Ford Probe and
Mazda MX6, which are built in the same facilities and have similar
designs. Two Probe fires have been reported.
   _Fires under dashboards of Chrysler Voyager Caravans from
1984-1989. Ten fires have been reported; 1.5 million vehicles are
on the road.
   _Brake failure in the 1986-88 Pontiac Bonneville, Buick LeSabre
and Oldsmobile 88. There have been 35 complaints alleging six
accidents and three injuries. An estimated 1.2 million of the cars
are in use.
   Preliminary evaluations also were begun on two child-restraint
seat models. There have been complaints of children pulling off and
putting in their mouths metallic labels of the Fisher Price model
9100 made in 1988 and foam rubber from Century Products models
4365DT and 4366BH made in 1989.
   The agency closed the books on three preliminary evaluations,
finding no defect trends.
   Those included investigations of axle seal failures in 643,800
General Motors Safari and Astro minivans from 1985-88; breaking
stabilizer bars in 567,000 Toyota Tercels from 1982-88; and wearing
parking brake cable sheaths on the Chevrolet Monte Carlo,
Oldsmobile 88 and Pontiac Grand Prix from 1985-88.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Prices Finish Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices ended mostly higher Thursday,
boosted in part by strength in the heating oil market.
   Energy prices were unaffected for the second day by the
devastating San Francisco Bay earthquake. Most gasoline pipelines
closed after the quake hit on Tuesday were reopened by late
Wednesday and refineries were reported operating at or near normal.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
domestic heating oil rose 0.29 cent to finish at 60.89 cents a
gallon, after dipping 0.45 cent in the previous session.
   ``I like the way heating oil came back today,'' said James
Steel, analyst with Refco Inc. ``It could be partly because there
is a bigger shortage in Europe than we realize.''
   Colder weather in many parts of the country also helped prices,
traders said.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for November delivery closed 0.07
cent higher at 54.65 cents a gallon after a 1.26 cent decline on
Wednesday.
   Prices of West Texas Intermediate crude were mostly higher with
the exception of the November contract, which closed down 14 cents
at $20.42 a barrel. The contract for December delivery settled 17
cents higher at $20.42 and January finished at $20.18, up 22 cents.
   Projections of higher fourth-quarter demand by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries' technical committee had no
immediate impact on the market, traders said.
   The OPEC committee projected that worldwide demand for OPEC oil
would increase by 600,000 barrels a day to 23.1 million barrels in
the final quarter of 1989 from the estimated 22.5 million barrels
that the cartel is now producing.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Amoco Corp. posted a 39 percent drop in third-quarter profit due
partly to lower refining earnings and an $80 million charge for
environmental programs, the company said Thursday.
   Schlumberger Ltd., meanwhile, reported its third-quarter profit
rose nearly 2 percent as oilfield earnings offset a decrease in
interest income.
   And Ashland Oil Inc. said an after-tax charge of $78 million in
the fourth quarter will result in a net loss for the period and
significantly lower results for the year.
   Chicago-based Amoco said its third-quarter earnings tumbled to
$336 million, or 65 cents a share, from $552 million, or $1.07 a
share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue climbed 12 percent to
$6.6 billion, from $5.9 billion a year ago.
   Amoco's nine-month earnings declined 24 percent to $1.3 billion,
or $2.50 a share, from $1.7 billion, or $3.28 a share, in the same
1988 period. The oil company's revenue, meanwhile, climbed 12
percent to $19.9 billion from $17.7 billion in 1988.
   For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, New York-based
Schlumberger said its net income totaled $114.2 million, or 48
cents a share, compared with $112.2 million, or 42 cents a share,
in the same 1988 quarter.
   Revenue totaled $1.12 billion, down 6 percent from $1.18 billion
a year ago.
   Amoco Chairman Richard M. Morrow said an $80 million charge to
``increase provisions for future costs of refining and marketing
environmental programs'' helped reduce third-quarter results.
   Also contributing to the third-quarter decline were lower
production earnings overseas _ $12 million compared with $95
million in the 1988 third period _ and lower U.S. refining,
marketing and transportation income _ $134 million vs. $319 million
a year ago.
   In addition, higher interest income and operating costs offset
the favorable effects of higher crude oil prices and increased
natural gas and crude oil production, Amoco said.
   Schlumberger's income in the first nine months fell 9.5 percent
to $323.4 million, or $1.36 a share, from $357.2 million, or $1.32
a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue declined 5 percent
to $3.48 billion from $3.68 billion.
   Schlumberger Chairman Euan Baird said the company experienced
growth in its oilfield services unit in the third period despite a
9 percent decline in the average number of active rigs worldwide.
That helped offset a decrease in interest income stemming from a
$1.2 billion stock buyback in 1988.
   The nine-month figures include a gain of $13 million, or 5 cents
a share, from the sale of a defense systems unit and a $22 million
extraordinary gain from an award by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal.
The award stemmed from a claim filed by Schlumberger over oilfield
equipment left in Iran a decade earlier when many U.S. companies
evacuated the country due to political turmoil and the rescinding
of oil exploration agreements.
   Ashland, based in Ashland, Ky., said its fourth-quarter charges
include $38 million from a previously announced $325 million
settlement with the National Iranian Oil Co., a $15 million charge
from the planned sale of Ashland's Technology Corp. subsidiary and
a $25 million charge stemming from costs to correct performance
problems at its Riley Consolidated subsidiary.
   The out-of-court settlement with Iran involved claims for oil
that had not been paid for a decade ago when Iran rescinded
exploration agreements with Ashland as well as other U.S. oil
companies.
   Ashland said it plans to announce its results next week. In last
year's fourth quarter, the company had net income of $66 million,
or $1.19 a share, on revenue of $2.2 billion. For the 1988 fiscal
year, it had net income of $224 million, or $4.01, a share, on
revenue of $8.2 billion.

<HEAD>Lawson Stands Firm On Inflation Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Nigel Lawson reaffirmed on Thursday
that Britain's interest rates would stay high ``for some time to
come.''
   Lawson ruled out any alternative to his strategy of raising
interest rates to curb inflation, and said there would be no major
policy changes.
   He also criticized European proposals for a single European
currency, warning any attempt to create a single central bank for
Europe could ``end in tears.''
   Lawson made his comments at the annual banquet of the Lord Mayor
of London. Called the ``Mansion House speech,'' it is a traditional
platform from which the government announces changes in economic
policies.
   The government has pushed up interest rates to 15 percent, their
highest level in eight years, to support the recently weak pound
and slow down inflation, which is running at an annual rate of 7.6
percent.
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit of $26.8 billion in the
first eight months of this year eventually will narrow and
inflation will abate, Lawson predicted.

   The dollar finished mixed against major foreign
currencies Thursday at the end of an uneventful session.
   Gold prices eased in the United States after posting scattered
gains and losses overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
settled at $367.10 a troy ounce, down $1.60 from Wednesday.
Republic National Bank quoted a troy ounce of gold at $366.50 at 4
p.m. EDT, $2.20 lower than Wednesday's late bid.
   Currency dealers in financial centers around the world
temporarily sold dollars when news broke that the U.S. Consumer
Price Index went up a modest 0.2 percent in September.
   But the unexpectedly small inflation rate, released at the start
of the U.S. business day, had little lasting impact on currency
trading.
   Speculation about the chances for lower interest rates
circulated in the markets and tended to temper any urge to buy
dollars, dealers said. The low inflation reading could give the
Federal Reserve Board greater leeway to ease monetary tightness,
leading to lower interest rates.
   ``There was no real direction in the market,'' said Siobhan
Lackey, an assistant on the foreign exchange desk of Bank Julius
Baer &amp; Co. ``There wasn't that wild of a reaction to the inflation
news.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 141.55 yen from 142.10 yen at
Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it fell further to 141.25 yen.
But at the end of New York's day the dollar was quoted at 142 yen,
stronger than Wednesday's late level of 141.40 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5940 from $1.5880 late
Wednesday. In New York, a pound fetched $1.5975 vs. $1.5922 on
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Wednesday's
quotes included: 1.8500 West German marks, up from 1.8485; 1.6205
Swiss francs, down from 1.6243; 6.27895 French francs, down from
6.2810; 1.17405 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17335; and 1,360.95
Italian lire, down from 1,362.00.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late rates on
Wednesday, included: 1.8525 West German marks, unchanged; 1.6225
Swiss francs, down from 1.6255; 6.2875 French francs, down from
6.2990; 2.0820 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0818; 1,358.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,366.00; and 1.1741 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1737.
   In precious metals trading, gold prices posted mixed results
while silver moved lower.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $367.75 a troy ounce,
down from $368.25 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold fell to a
closing $368.20 bid from $368.50 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 51 cents to close at a bid
$368.89.
   On New York's Comex silver bullion for current delivery closed
at $5.08 a troy ounce, down from Wednesday's settlement of $5.105.
Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.09 a troy
ounce, down from $5.11 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Soviet Purchase Boosts Corn Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Signs of a large Soviet purchase of U.S. corn pulled corn
futures prices up sharply Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade
and it wasn't just idle speculation.
   The Agriculture Department confirmed after the close that the
Soviet Union had bought 1.2 million metric tons of corn.
   On other commodity markets, copper futures rallied while
precious metals retreated; stock-index futures soared; energy
futures advanced and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Corn settled 2 cents to 5} cents higher with the contract for
December delivery at $2.44 a bushel.
   Wheat futures finished { cent to 1{ cents higher with December
at $4.07} a bushel; oats were { cent to 1} cents higher with
December at $1.46 a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 9 cents higher
with November at $5.66} a bushel.
   Heavy buying of corn futures by grain exporters, freqently a
signal of a large foreign purchase, fueled speculation that the
Soviets had been in the market overnight. The purchase had been
rumored to be as large as 2 million metric tons.
   Persistent rumors of Soviet interest in U.S. soybean meal and
soybean oil continued on Thursday, giving the soybean complex a
boost, and wheat futures gained as the enthusiasm spread from the
corn and soybean pits to the wheat arena.
   Export sales of corn and soybeans typically increase in
mid-autumn, when newly harvested crops increase the supply and
bring prices down.
   ``A general rule of thumb in these markets is that after the
harvest is past the halfway point you'll see a rally, and we're
past the halfway point now,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain-market
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   The harvest has suffered a setback this week due to cold, stormy
weather in the Midwest, and a storm was expected to drop up to six
inches of snow in the eastern Corn Belt overnight.
   But forecasts for mild weekend temperatures and
drier-than-normal conditions next week minimized chances of
significant harvest delays.
   ``If anyone bought today on weather, they bought for the wrong
reason,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s
floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   Copper futures rallied modestly on New York's Commodity Exchange
after slipping on Thursday below $1.27 a pound in a move that some
analysts had interpreted as a signal the market was weakening
significantly.
   Precious metals prices declined following the government's
report of a lower-than-expected 0.2 percent rise in consumer prices
last month.
   Copper settled 1.3 cents to 2.3 cents higher with December at
$1.2795 a pound; gold finished $1.80 lower across the board with
December at $370.60 a troy ounce; silver was 2.5 cents to 2.8 cents
lower with December at $5.133 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures advanced strongly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange as jitters linked to last Friday's collapse continued to
fade. The contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled 4.95 points higher at 349.60.
The contract is valued at $500 a point.
   Most energy futures prices rallied on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, boosted by strength in the heating oil market.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 14 cents lower to 22
cents higher with November at $20.42 a barrel; heating oil was .01
cent lower to .36 cent higher with November at 60.89 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .10 cent higher with
November at 54.65 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat trading was cautious on the Chicago Merc
ahead of Friday's quarterly USDA cattle-on-feed report and Monday's
monthly USDA cold-storage report.
   Live cattle were .22 cent lower to .05 cent higher with October
at 74.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .25 cent
lower with October at 83 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent
lower to .03 cent higher with October at 48.75 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .13 cent to .55 cent higher with February
at 51.97 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Colgate-Palmolive Profit Climbs 28 Percent In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colgate-Palmolive Co. said Thursday its
third-quarter profit rose 27.5 percent, aided by more efficient
manufacturing operations and strong sales growth.
   For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, the consumer products
company reported net income of $76.7 million, or $1.06 a share, up
from $60.2 million, or 88 cents a share, in the same 1988 quarter.
   Revenue increased 6 percent to $1.26 billion from $1.19 billion.
   Colgate-Palmolive, headquartered in New York, markets its
products under such brand names as Ajax, Fab and Irish Spring, in
addition to Colgate and Palmolive.
   Net income in the first nine months rose 14 percent to $217.5
million, or $3.09 a share, from $191.1 million, or $2.79 a share,
in the comparable period last year. Sales grew by 7 percent to
$3.75 billion from $3.52 billion.
   Colgate-Palmolive Chairman Reuben Mark said the company
``generated the highest return on sales in almost half a century,
well in excess of our 5 percent target level'' in the latest
quarter.
   Mark said that in addition to strong domestic sales, all major
geographic regions showed strong profit growth, particularly Europe
and South America despite the adverse effects of the stronger
dollar.
   Net earnings also benefited from reduced net interest expense
after the divestment of one of its units and the expansion of its
employee stock ownership program.
   Volume increases, manufacturing efficiencies, and strategic
price increases also helped boost pre-tax earnings by 32 percent,
the company said.

<HEAD>Modest September Inflation Soothes Frazzled Markets</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to UPDATE with closing of stock market.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose an unexpectedly modest
0.2 percent in September, the government said Thursday, soothing
frazzled financial markets.
   Investors took the report as an indication the Federal Reserve
Board has room to lower interest rates, and the stock market
rallied. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 39.55
points to 2,683.20.
   Inflation, which had been rising at a 6.7 percent annual rate
from January through May, has abated to a 4.4 percent rate for the
first nine months of the year.
   The inflation rate so far this year is the same as in both 1988
and 1987 and well under the Bush administration's 1989 inflation
projection of 5 percent.
   Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser at the White House,
called the report ``good economic news.''
   ``We're delighted to be able to say that, while we're always on
guard to make sure that inflation remains under control, the
concern earlier in the year that inflation was getting out of
control appears to have been unfounded,'' he said.
   The seasonally adjusted increase in the Labor Department's
Consumer Price Index follows no gain at all in August and similarly
modest 0.2 percent rises in July and June.
   Although private economists said inflation was likely to pick up
in the fourth quarter, jittery stock and bond markets rallied on
Thursday's news, interpreting it as a sign the Federal Reserve
likely will nudge interest rates lower.
   Because of the stock market turmoil set off by the Friday the
13th nosedive, the Fed has eased a key interest rate from about 9
percent to 8.75 percent. Analysts predicted another quarter-point
decline soon in the federal funds rate, which banks charge each
other for overnight loans.
   ``Under these circumstances, there is no question that interest
rates will fall,'' said economist William K. MacReynolds of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   In an effort to contain inflation, the Fed has been using high
interest rates to slow the economy. Although wholesale-price
inflation shot up 0.9 percent in September, other statistics for
the month portray a sluggish economy with weakening manufacturing
employment, industrial production and housing construction.
   In other reports:
   _The Labor Department said new state unemployment claims for the
week ending Oct. 7 grew 62,000 in a week's time to 396,000. That
report amounted to a further indication of the economy's softness.
   _The department said Americans' average real weekly earnings of
$338.67 in September were up 3.5 percent from a year earlier _ not
enough to keep up with inflation. Adjusted for inflation, earnings
rose 0.3 percent last month following a 0.7 percent decline in
August.
   The nation's 38.9 million Social Security recipients watched
Thursday's consumer-price report with particular interest because
it affected the benefit increase they're due to receive in January.
   Benefits will climb 4.7 percent, the biggest boost in 7{ years,
to offset the effects of inflation over the last year. The average
monthly payment will climb $25 to $566.
   At the same time, the cap on Social Security payroll taxes will
rise. Workers will have to pay the tax on their first $50,400 in
wages, up from $48,000.
   Analysts were suprised by the September inflation data. They had
been expecting higher crude oil costs to ripple through to gasoline
pumps, pushing up prices overall by about 0.4 percent.
   But energy prices declined for the fourth consecutive month.
Gasoline, down 2.2 percent in September, has fallen 9.3 percent in
the last four months after increasing 21.2 percent in the first
five months of the year.
   Fuel oil prices dropped 0.2 percent last month after declining
0.9 percent in August.
   Economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago
said higher energy prices likely will show up when October's report
is released.
   ``There has been an abatement of inflation, but it hasn't been
to the degree that this (0.2 percent) number would suggest,'' he
said. ``We're likely to have some less attractive numbers in the
fourth quarter.'
   Food prices, which had shot up at a 9.3 percent annual rate
through May, climbed at a rate of just 1.7 percent from June
through September. They rose a moderate 0.2 percent last month, in
part because of a 1.1 percent decline for fruits and vegetables.
   Coffee prices fell 2.7 percent last month. However, the index
for dairy products jumped 1.4 percent, the largest monthly increase
since May 1980.
   Clothing prices, after falling in the three preceding months,
rose 1.7 percent in September, with another increase expected for
October. Prices for apparel for women and girls, reflecting the
introduction of new fall and winter fashions, were up 3.6 percent.
   Economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said the
September report was favorably influenced by several price drops
unlikely to be repeated.
   The cost of new cars fell 0.4 percent, the fifth drop in a row
and the longest such string since the Labor Department began
tracking those prices in 1953, he said.
   Auto dealers ``are giving the ... things away,'' he said.
``There's a point where you just can't do more and I think they've
reached that point.''
   Tuition and school fees fell 0.4 percent, seasonally adjusted,
while hotel and motel costs dropped 4.5 percent.
   The various changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at
125.0 in September, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods
and services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period would have
cost $125 last month.

   The San Francisco Bay area earthquake revived
a debate over whether 16-year-old federal seismic standards for
nuclear power plants are tough enough.
   Tuesday's quake caused no damage to the five active nuclear
reactors in California, according to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. The three that were operating at the time are still
running normally, said Frank Ingram, an NRC spokesman.
   The five reactors are in Southern California: two at Diablo
Canyon, 12 miles southwest of San Luis Obispo, and three at San
Onofre, five miles south of San Clemente. One reactor at each site
was shut down for normal refueling when the quake hit.
   Under the 1973 standards set by the NRC, each nuclear power
plant must be built to quake-resistance specifications that differ
according to local seismic conditions. The standards for Diablo
Canyon are the stiffest in the country, Ingram said.
   The risk of nuclear plant accidents from earthquakes was a major
point of contention between the industry and environmentalists
during the 1960s and early 1970s, when site planning was done for
most of the 110 plants now operating in this country.
   The chief danger is that a quake would cause a crack in the
piping that carries cooling water to the reactor core. A rapid loss
of coolant could cause the fuel rods in the core to melt, possibly
allowing radioactive material to escape into the atmosphere.
   Although the seismic issue has faded in recent years, the
environmental group Public Citizen, founded by consumer advocate
Ralph Nader, said Wednesday the Northern California quake
underscored a need to reexamine the nuclear construction standards.
   ``Federal regulators should at least view (the) earthquake as a
final warning that seismic standards and testing for all nuclear
reactors as well as evacuation planning needs to be substantially
upgraded before the next quake hits,'' said Ken Bossong, director
of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project.
   Bossong said at least two nuclear plants are ``perilously close
to known fault lines.'' He cited Diablo Canyon, which is near the
Hosgri fault, and Millstone, near the point at which the Honey Hill
and Lake Char fault lines intersect in Connecticut.
   Bossong also noted that the Energy Department has acknowledged
that its three active nuclear reactors at the Savannah River
weapons complex in South Caroline, which make materials for nuclear
warheads, need to undergo seismic upgrades.
   Some specialists, however, say the seismic standards for
commercial nuclear reactors are adequate.
   Larry White, an environmental engineer with the consulting firm
Roy F. Weston Inc. in Washington, said the standards are ``pretty
conservative,'' although he acknowledges there is ``a lot of
uncertainty'' in attempting to predict how structures such as
nuclear plants would respond to the worst possible quake.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Oct. 9, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,170.6 billion from $3,165.8 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,013.4 billion from $4,005.2 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $786.0 billion from $789.3 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.1 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.3 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,142.6 billion, a 7.7
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,008.8 billion, up 4.2 percent, while M1
rose 2.2 percent to an average of $779.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $2.122 billion.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $468 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$800 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $411
million in the two weeks ended Oct. 18, up from $34 million in the
previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $293.0 billion in the two-week period ended
Oct. 18, up from $291.7 billion two weeks earlier.

   The chief of the International Monetary Fund
credits Japan with significant economic achievements and says the
Japanese should now take the lead in eliminating trade barriers.
   ``It is particularly important for Japan to take further steps
to improve market access for imported goods,'' said IMF Managing
Director Michel Camdessus.
   Specifically, the IMF chief called for Japan to loosen quota and
tariff restrictions on agricultural products, echoing U.S. demands
aimed at reducing Japan's high trade surplus with the United States.
   Camdessus, former governor of the Bank of France and now head of
the 152-nation IMF, addressed the Japan Society in New York
Wednesday night and the text of his speech was released here
Thursday.
   ``I believe that Japan is in a position to take unilateral steps
to reduce trade barriers, and thus to assume a leadership role in
promoting multilateral trade liberalization'' in the current global
trade talks at Geneva, he said.
   In addition to easing Japanese restrictions on foreign farm
products, Camdessus called for reforms in land management and the
distribution system. He said he supported Japan's recent efforts to
tighten credit in order to avert inflation but added there is also
``an urgent need for a more determined effort to remove structural
impediments to growth.''
   He said that while Japan has made significant progress in
boosting domestic demand in other areas the reforms have been
limited.
   The United States and Japan are already holding bimonthly
structural talks at which U.S. officials are pressing for changes
in Japanese distribution and land-use systems that they maintain
are anticompetitive, discriminate against imports and penalize
consumers.
   Camdessus said he agreed with the advice Japan is giving the
United States in their structural talks _ to reduce deficit
spending and increase savings and investment.
   Conditions are favorable today for ``the major deficit
countries'' to make needed changes, he said, naming only the United
States.
   ``Action to strengthen the public finances in many of these
countries, including the United States, would raise national
savings, make room for an improvement in net export and reduce
pressure on prices and interest rates,'' he said.
   Camdessus said Japans's national savings rate never fell below
30 percent of gross national product during the 1980s. In 1988,
when its surpluses were declining, it hit a peak of 33 percent, ``a
remarkable performance, by any standards ... given the overall
shortage of world savings in recent years.''
   The U.S. personal savings rate, after taxable income, fell to
3.2 percent in 1987 and rose to 4.2 percent in 1988, while the
comparable Japanese rate was 16.5 percent in 1987, according to
U.S. Treasury figures.

   Stock prices rose broadly Thursday, marking the
second anniversary of the Black Monday crash with a rally sparked
by better-than-expected inflation news and extending the recovery
from the market's latest slide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which plunged 190.58
points last Friday, finished up 39.55 points at 2,683.20. The rise
gave the widely followed market indicator a gain of 112.94 points
during this week's first four sessions.
   Broader market indicators also rose, with seven issues advancing
for every two that dropped on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The upsurge came on the second anniversary of the Oct. 19, 1987
Black Monday crash that saw the Dow industrials nosedive 508 points
to 1,738.74.
   The market got a lift when the Labor Department reported the
consumer price index rose just 0.2 percent in September.
   The increase was about half of what had been expected, given a
sharp rise in the producer price index of finished goods reported
last week for September.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets in response to the
news, which raised speculation that the Federal Reserve might have
more leeway to push rates lower, making mortgages and other loans
more affordable.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, rose about $7.50 for each $1,000 in
face value, with the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond
falling to about 7.95 percent from 8.03 percent late Wednesday.

   The Delaware Supreme Court has sided with Time
Warner Inc., affirming a lower court decision that swept away what
is probably the last obstacle to the acquisition of Warner
Communications Inc.
   Time Inc. earlier this year began a two-stage $14 billion buyout
of Warner in which it initially purchased a controlling interest in
Warner for $70 a share in cash. Time then became Time Warner Inc.
   But Chris-Craft Industries Inc., which had been Warner's biggest
shareholder before Time completed the first phase of the buyout,
contended that it had the right to veto the structure of the second
part of the deal.
   It argued that as the only holder of Warner's Series B preferred
stock, it had the right to vote as a class on the merger agreement.
   But a Delaware Chancery Court judge ruled against Chris-Craft
last month and a three-judge panel of the Delaware Supreme Court
meeting in Dover, Del., affirmed that ruling late Wednesday.
   Time Warner currently owns about 69 percent of Warner's shares
and has offered a package of preferred stock plus Warner's stake in
a Chris-Craft subsidiary for the remainder.
   A Warner spokeswoman said the deal is expected to be completed
by the end of the year.

   Better-than-expected inflation news helped send
stock prices broadly higher Thursday, extending the market's
recovery from last week's ``Friday the 13th massacre'' and marking
the second anniversary of its 1987 crash in style.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 39.55 points to
2,683.20.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,235 up, 355 down and 379 unchanged.
   After taking a 190.58-point tumble last Friday for its
second-largest point loss on record, the Dow Jones industrial
average has rebounded 113.94 points over this week's first four
sessions.
   Thursday's jump came exactly two years after the Dow industrials
plummeted 508 points in the infamous Black Monday crash that rocked
markets worldwide.
   The market got an extra lift Thursday morning when the Labor
Department reported that the consumer price index rose just 0.2
percent in September.
   The increase was about half of what had been expected, given the
upswing in the producer price index of finished goods reported last
week for September.
   Analysts said it seemed to improve the odds, as traders saw
them, that the Federal Reserve might soon take new steps to relax
its credit policy.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets in response to the
news. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, rose more than $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 7.96 percent-8.04
percent range.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose ~ to 43] in active trading.
The company reported third-quarter earnings of 65 cents a share, up
from 55 cents in the like period last year.
   International Business Machines, which authorized an additional
$1 billion in repurchases of its stock, added 2] to 104[.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 1[
at 44{; Procter &amp; Gamble, up } at 128; General Motors, up | at 45{;
Coca-Cola, up 2] at 70], and DuPont, up 1{ at 115~.
   American Medical International was up 1~ at 23|. An investor
group said it obtained bank financing for a $26.50-a-share buyout
of the company.
   Brokers said the AMI news was taken as a plus for stocks in
general, at a time when recent snags in other proposed deals have
unsettled both the stock and high-yield, or ``junk,'' bond markets.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 198.12 million
shares, up from 166.90 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 224.95 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $50.28 billion, or
1.50 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 2.85 to 192.17.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 6.35 to 396.57, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 5.37 at 347.13.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
jumped 7.52 to 470.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 382.81, up 4.74.

functions are combined under a Joint Operating Agreement.
   Since 1986, Tully and Hartmann have shared management of the
business departments of the newspapers.
   Hartmann announced Wednesday he would step down as chairman of
the JOA's management committee at the end of the year.
   Tuley will assume full responsibility for the management
arrangement on Jan. 1 in addition to continuing his duties as
editor of The Courier. Hartman will continue as publisher of The
Press.
   Tuley, 49, has been editor and president of The Courier since
Scripps Howard purchased the newspaper in 1986. He was editor of
The Press from 1983 to 1986, prior to Scripps Howard's sale of The
Press and acquisition of The Courier.

<HEAD>FDIC To Offer $428 Million Package Of Real Estate From Insolvent
Thrifts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one of the federal government's largest real
estate deals, regulators said Thursday they will sell a $428
million portfolio of property acquired through the bailout of
insolvent thrifts in five states.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., announced the plan during a speech to Dallas real estate and
financial executives.
   Of the 150 properties, 82 are in Texas and the rest are in
California, Colorado, Arizona and Florida. He said regulators hoped
to sell the real estate in one package but would sell it in pieces
if necessary.
   The properties, which include residential, commercial,
industrial, retail and vacant land, are part of the $2.7 billion in
assets being managed by the Federal Asset Disposition Association,
which is being dissolved under legislation rescuing the savings and
loan industry.
   In addition, Seidman said the FDIC had received considerable
interest in the FADA organization, which is being sold separately
through sealed bids due Oct. 31.
   Seidman said the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created to
supervise the thrift bailout, will take over an additional 300
insolvent S&amp;Ls this year, giving it control of more than 600
institutions and more than $350 billion in deposits.
   Separately, Seidman said the $50 billion Congress provided to
rescue the thrift industry may be enough if losses continue to
decline at the current rapid rate. In the past, Seidman has
indicated Congress may have to appropriate more money.
   Overall, Seidman said the RTC eventually will have to return $65
billion to $70 billion of repossessed real estate into private
hands.
   ``I don't think it will be sold in the five years that the RTC
is mandated to sell it. It's going to be a factor in the market
over the next decade,'' Seidman told reporters after his speech.
   He said it would be at least a year before regulators begin
selling most of the properties.

<HEAD>Gillette Reports 2 Percent Growth In Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. reported Thursday its earnings grew 2
percent in the third quarter compared with the same period a year
ago, as sales rose by more than $70 million.
   Gillette, which controls about 60 percent of the world market in
razors, had net income of $65.2 million for the quarter ended Sept.
30, compared with $63.9 million for the third quarter of 1988.
Earnings per share were the same in both quarters, 57 cents.
   Sales for the third quarter totaled $921.6 million, compared
with $845.7 million in the year-ago period.
   For the first nine months of the year, net income was down
slightly, from $207 million, or $1.82 a share, in 1988 to $205.3
million, or $2.02 a share, this year. Sales for the first nine
months of 1989 totaled $2.76 billion, compared with $2.61 billion
in the same period last year.
   Earlier this month Gillette introduced a new razor, called
Sensor, which will go on sale next year. The razor will be priced
higher than the company's current brands, and Gillette officials
hope the product will yield more profits.

<HEAD>New ``I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing'' Coke Ad Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1971, Coca-Cola Co. gathered a group of people
on an Italian hillside near Rome and taught the world to sing.
   Next year, the company is going to try to do it again.
   Coke officials announced Thursday plans for a new version of the
famous ``Hilltop'' commercial.
   The ad spawned two versions of ``I'd Like To Teach the World to
Sing'' that both climbed the pop music charts and sold a combined 1
million copies in a year.
   The Atlanta-based company periodically has produced special
``peace on earth'' versions of the ad for the Christmas season,
with one in 1977 featuring people aligned in the shape of a
Christmas tree on a Brazilian hillside, holding candles while
singing the song.
   Coke hopes the spot will be as successful next year.
   ``The message of `Hilltop' is as relevant today as it was 20
years ago,'' said Michael A. Beindorff, Coke's vice president for
marketing planning. ``We're bringing forward the memorable
qualities of the original spot and combining them with all the hope
and promise of today's youth.''

<HEAD>Holiday Corp. Third-Quarter Earnings Leap 89 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holiday Corp. on Thursday reported its
earnings increased 89 percent in the third quarter on the strength
of record income from its gaming operations and the sale of
property.
   Holiday Corp. said it earned $39.7 million, or $1.53 per share,
in the quarter ended Sept. 29, up from $21 million, or 84 cents per
share, in the third quarter of 1988.
   Revenue rose to $433.5 million from last year's $422.1 million.
The company said the results included $19.2 million in pre-tax
gains from property transactions, including the sale of one Embassy
Suites hotel, and $3.5 million in non-recurring costs associated
with the sale of the Holiday Inn hotel chain to Bass PLC.
   Gaming operating income for the third quarter increased to a
record $61.4 million on the strength of record results at the
company's Las Vegas and Atlantic City casinos, the company said.
Hotel operating income for the quarter was even with last year.
   ``During the quarter we negotiated the largest and most
significant transaction in our 37-year history,'' Michael D. Rose,
chairman, president and chief executive officer, said of the $2.23
billion deal with Bass. The sale is expected to close in January.
   For the first nine months of the year, Holiday earned $99.1
million, or $3.86 a share, compared with $102.1 million, or $4.10 a
share, in the first nine months of 1988. Revenue for the first nine
months totaled $1.21 billion, compared with $1.23 billion in the
year-ago period.
   Holiday also announced it planned to make a tender offer and
solicit consents for the repurchase of $1.4 billion of its publicly
traded debt. The repurchase is part of the sale of the Holiday Inn
chain to Bass.

<HEAD>Young &amp; Rubicam Says It Resigned Jamaica Account That Led to Indictment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. said Thursday it would end
its contract with the Jamaica Tourist Board, an account that led to
charges that the advertising agency paid nearly $1 million in
bribes to Jamaican officials.
   ``Y&amp;R and the Jamaica Tourist Board have reviewed our contract
and under the present circumstances have agreed that it is prudent
to discontinue that contract,'' Alex Kroll, the ad agency's
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
   He said Y&amp;R would represent the tourist board until it finds a
new ad agency.
   The tourist board issued its own statement later Thursday in
which it expressed ``shock'' at the timing and content of Y&amp;R's
announcement.
   The tourist board said the ad agency had not notified the board
that it would make such a statement. The board also said it had
notified Y&amp;R on Oct. 10 of its intent to cancel the agency's
account.
   ``The board wishes to emphasize that the decision to terminate
Y&amp;R is a result of the development of an unsatisfactory commerical
relationship between Y&amp;R and the board and is not to be interpreted
as a comment on the accuracy of the allegations reflected in the
indictment,'' the tourist board said.
   The indictment, handed up earlier this month by a federal grand
jury in Connecticut, charges the New York-based agency, two of its
executives and a former executive with racketeering and conspiracy
to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   Jamaica's former minister of tourism and another Jamaican were
charged with accepting the bribes.
   The ad agency and its executives and former executive pleaded
innocent. The Jamaican officials have not appeared in court on the
charges.
