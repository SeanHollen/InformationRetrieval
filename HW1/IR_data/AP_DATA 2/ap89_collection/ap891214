<HEAD>Report: Feds Knew Workers Were In Danger From Nevada Nuclear Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials knew that workers at the
Nevada Test Site were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation from
nuclear bomb blasts in the 1950s and '60s, according to government
records cited by The New York Times.
   But the officials decided not to reduce the exposure or inform
the workers out of fear that changing procedures and equipment
could disrupt nuclear testing, according to Thursday editions of
the Times.
   The documents were made available to the newspaper by Las Vegas
lawyers Alan R. Johns and Larry C. Johns, who allege in a lawsuit
against the government that radiation from bomb tests caused the
cancer deaths of 200 Nevada Test Site employees and cancer illness
in 18 others.
   According to minutes of a Sept. 23, 1952, meeting of the Atomic
Energy Commission, predecessor of the Department of Energy, ``the
commissioners expressed concern that workers might be exposed to
radiation hazards for too long a time.''
   Two weeks later, the commissioners were told that the program
for determining how much radiation hundreds of workers were exposed
to was not reliable, the Times said.
   By May 13, 1953, some commissioners were calling for the
reduction of worker exposures by lowering the government's annual
safety limit, which stood then at 12 rems.
   Dr. John C. Bugher, the AEC's chief health officer at the time,
advised against lowering the limit, saying it ``would make it
impossible to conduct operations at the test site without major
changes.''
   Today the annual safety limit is five rems. Rems measure
radiation doses.
   The records show miners were ordered soon after nuclear blasts
to recover instruments from tunnel filled with radioactive dust and
contaminated debris. In the 1950s, workers cleaned up rubble at
detonation sites without respirators to protect their lungs, the
Times said.
   On Nov. 24, 1961, 108 miners were pulled from two tunnels after
they absorbed doses exceeding safety limits. The miners were
offered as much beer as they could drink for a week to flush the
contaminants from their bodies, the Times said.
   On June 6, 1963, 13 miners who had been clearing rubble from a
tunnel on the night shift were found to be contaminated by
radioactive iodine produced by a test in the tunnel the day before.
Miners on the next shift were ordered to continue work in the
tunnel despite the contamination, the Times said.

   The Syracuse University students who died
aboard Pan Am Flight 103 last December were remembered by nearly
600 people Wednesday during an all-faith vigil marking the first
anniversary of the jetliner's bombing.
   ``They have given us a precious gift. They have given us each
other,'' said the Rev. Michael Rothermel during a 45-minute service
at the university's Hendricks Chapel.
   ``In the deaths that seemed too soon and that never should have
happened that way, they gave us a grieving vulnerability to see
each other anew, to see the preciousness in each other, to see the
infinite value and worth,'' Rothermel said.
   Rothermel and five other clergymen told those in attendance the
vigil's purpose was to keep alive the memories of the 35 students
who were among 259 who perished when the jumbo jetliner exploded
over Lockerbie, Scotland, last Dec. 21.
   Eleven residents of Lockerbie also were killed when pieces of
the jet crashed onto the village.
   The students, 25 of whom attended Syracuse, were returning to
the United States after a semester studying overseas under the
university's Division of International Programs Abroad.
   The mood of Wednesday night's vigil was not as oppressive as
that which weighed on mourners last year when the chapel opened its
doors in the immediate hours after news of the crash reached the
campus.
   Heads were bowed as a silent processional of 35 students made
its way into the chapel. Each carried a single lighted candle in
memory of their dead classmates.
   Emotions became more visible as senior Marcela Honigman read
aloud the names of those who perished in the bombing, but it was
Rothermel's words that struck the deepest passions.
   ``It still hurts, doesn't it? During the past few days, the
images have beguntumbling back in my mind,'' he said.
   Many in the gathering, made up mostly of students, began
weeping, holding hands or reaching out for one another.
   ``Tonight, we keep vigil to stay awake those memories,'' he said.
   The service was scheduled for Wednesday, eight days before the
anniversary, to allow students to attend. Final examinations begin
Thursday and conclude on Dec. 20. The chapel will be open Dec. 21
for private prayer.

<HEAD>Remains of Shakespeare's Globe Get State Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remains of William Shakespeare's Globe Theater
have been designated an ancient monument by the government,
guaranteeing them state protection.
   The discovery of three chalk and brick foundation walls, part of
the back of the historic Globe, was announced Oct. 12 by the
British conglomerate, Hanson PLC, which owns the site, and the
Museum of London.
   The remains on the south bank of the Thames river near Southwark
Bridge were granted the protection Wednesday by Environment
Secretary Christopher Patten as an ancient monumen, said David
Trippier, heritage minister at the Department of the Environment.
   The Globe saw the first performances of Shakespeare's great
tragedies, ``Hamlet,'' ``Othello,'' ``King Lear'' and ``Macbeth.''
   The theater was built in 1599, rebuilt after a fire 14 years
later and destroyed in 1644 by the Puritans, who detested theaters.
   It appeared in panoramic drawings of London made at the time but
its exact shape and location had been a matter of argument among
scholars for some 200 years. Most of the site was covered later by
brewery buildings.
   Hanson invited archaeologists in after acquiring the site for
development and paid for the dig.
   Patten's decision brings the Globe site into the care of the
Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission, a government body of
experts dedicated to saving hstoric structures.
   Once a monument is scheduled nothing can be done to it without
consent from the environment department, acting on the commission's
advice.
   The decision follows a national outcry earlier this year when
developers were given the go-ahead to construct an office block
over the site of another Elizabethan theater near the Globe called
the Rose.
   The environment department said: ``The remains of the Globe were
very fragile whereas the remains of the Rose are safely buried
beneath a thin layer of concrete to protect them whilst development
is in progress.''

   When drought parched 1988 crops, a relief
program was already in place. But that program, federally
subsidized crop insurance, has been a shambles for years. The final
story in a series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,'' shows even
critics believe Congress must rely on a stronger insurance network
to eliminate big bailouts that follow natural disasters.

<TEXT>
   In 1980, Congress expanded its 42-year-old federal crop
insurance program. The goal was simple: farmers would better cover
themselves against the vagaries of nature and taxpayers would be
spared costly disaster payments to farmers.
   It hasn't turned out that way.
   Sales of crop insurance are well below expected levels. The
program is billions deep in red ink and under scrutiny after years
of alleged mismanagement. Congress still bails out farmers with
huge relief programs like the 1988 drought bill.
   ``Farmers are just the same as Wall Street; they'll take a
gamble if it means money,'' said Ed Jones, a farmer and former
Tennessee congressman who sponsored the 1980 bill. ``They don't
care about insurance if they think they are going to get a disaster
payment.''
   Last year was perfect illustration. With only 13 percent of the
nation's estimated 3.3 million farmers relying on
government-subsidized insurance, they collected $3.9 billion in
direct aid and an additional $1.1 billion in crop insurance
payments.
   An Associated Press study of the 1988 disaster program found
farmers who said they were ``made whole'' by both programs, earning
as much or more in insurance claims and disaster payments as they
would have with normal harvests.
   ``While Congress passed a law for crop insurance to be the
single source of aid in a time of disaster, that never happened
because Congress refused to let it happen,'' said Cliff Fowler, an
assistant director at the General Accounting Office, which issued
20 reports on problems with crop insurance over the last nine years.
   ``Congress would come in with disaster payments _ a free bailout
_ any time there was a disaster,'' said Fowler. ``If you were a
farmer, why would you buy insurance if Congress is going to bail
you out for fre?''
   Farmers, wise to the ways of politics, agree.
   ``You'd be crazy to buy insurance if you can count on a disaster
program,'' said M. Donald Clifton II, a Milton, Del., farmer who
received a $100,000 disaster payment for peas and lima beans lost
to drought last year.
   Clifton also collected insurance on some losses, but he is no
fan. ``You could hit it close if you bought insurance on odd number
years and didn't on election years when you're more likely to get
aid,'' he said.
   Yet crop insurance is still considered the best protection for
farmers. A September GAO report said insurance ``is a more
equitable and efficient way to provide disaster assistance than
emergency loan and direct payment programs.''
   Until this decade, crop insurance, begun in 1938, was limited to
26 crops on 10 percent of the nation's farmland.
   That changed with the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980, a bill
to make insurance all farmers' first line of defense against losses
from drought, flood, insects and blight.
   Congress envisioned a self-sustaining program. Farmers would buy
insurance to cover losses, just like any other business enterprise.
Government clerks would be replaced by private agents, selling
policies amid corn rows and wheat fields.
   Most importantly, disaster payments would be phased out.
Banishing these expensive programs, essentially free insurance for
farmers, would trim the budget and make growers more responsible.
   ``There were abuses ... examples of people planting even when
there was no soil moisture and they knew there would be no
harvest,'' said James Johnson, a former staff member with the House
Agriculture Committee. ``Farmers used bad management knowing there
was this entitlement at the end of the crop year.''
   Crop insurance coverage grew slowly over the decade. Last year
only 25 percent of the nation's farm fields were insured, well
under the 50 percent targeted by Congress.
   The figure hit 40 percent this year, but only because farmers
who were paid for losses greater than 65 percent last year had to
buy insurance for 1989.
   The Federal Crop Insurance Corp. has lost money every year since
1980, a total of more than $4 billion. Losses in 1988 alone
amounted to $579 million.
   As the federal tab for crop insurance went up, so did the cost
of the special disaster programs the insurance was to eliminate.
From 1974 to 1980 farmers received $3 billion in disaster payments.
The cost has soared beyond $7 billion this decade.
   Insurance rates are based on the risk insurance companies run of
paying a claim. Car insurance rates, for example, are based on
actuarial study of losses to accidents and theft, the amount of
money the insurer is likely to pay, and the amount of premium money
the company is likely to collect and invest.
   But the FCIC, without a certified actuary until 1986, made
optimistic forecasts that didn't match experience. One example:
premium income grew by only 10 percent from 1982 through 1986,
never exceeding $440 million a year. Yet the FCIC predicted premium
income of $700 million in 1987. It collected little more than half
that.
   ``The program is actuarily unsound,'' acknowledged John
Marshall, FCIC manager since 1988. ``To some extent our problems
are the result of expanding too rapidly. We didn't get our rates,
policies and procedures in place based on good research.''
   Jackie King, a Rehoboth, Del., insurance agent, recalls a policy
that lumped lima beans and snap beans together, even though they
have different growing seasons and risks.
   ``When I called to talk to the man who wrote the policy, he
said, `I didn't know there was a difference between a lima bean and
a snap bean,''' she said. ``I told them I was going to put the
policy under my desk. I wasn't going to insult these farmers.''
   The corporation has been criticized for not keeping a tight rein
on the private insurers who sell and service crop insurance. A 1987
GAO study found farmers were overpaid an average of 31 percent on
claims.
   At present, farmers can insure 50, 65 or 75 percent of their
crop, in the way a car owner chooses a deductible on auto
insurance. Farmers also choose what percentage of market price to
be compensated for. The FCIC subsidizes 15 percent to 30 percent of
premium costs depending on coverage. But rates and regulations
change yearly.
   ``If you're going to insure a 1981 Bronco, you get a quote and
it's done,'' said Ms. King. ``With crop insurance you have
different levels of coverage and different price selections. It can
get really confusing.''
   With all its problems, even critics believe crop insurance is
improving. A recent GAO study found the overpayment rate had
dropped to 16 percent. The FCIC is studying decades of weather and
crop reports to bring premiums in line with the actual cost of
insuring a crop.
   ``We are seeing some bright spots,'' said Marshall.
   But concern remains that the crop insurance program can't
succeed if farmers believe they will be protected by special
disaster programs.
   ``You either have a permanent disaster payment program or you
never do it again and have insurance,'' said Johnson, the former
staff member with the House Agriculture Committee.
   ``You have to do that before people will believe in one system
or the other.''

   To hear Agriculture Department economists tell
it, the nation's farmers, as a group, haven't had it so good in
years.
   That would seem to go against all evidence in plain sight. The
money crunches of the middle 1980s and the droughts of the last two
years were painful, sometimes terminal, for thousands of farm
families.
   No one is sure how many farmers had to leave the land. Annual
estimates by the Agriculture Department indicate that about 267,000
farms ``disappeared'' in the 1980s, a decrease from 2.44 million in
1980 to about 2.17 million in 1989. Of those, 40,000 have dropped
out since 1987.
   But not all of those left farming due to failure, bankruptcy,
foreclosure or drought; each decade realizes some attrition.
Compare the 267,000 dropouts in the 1980s with 516,000 in the
1970s, 1 million in the 1960s and 1.7 million in the 1950s.
   Drought in 1988 hurt vast areas, particularly the Midwest and
upper Great Plains. And in places, the land remains parched, with
too little moisture soaking below the surface.
   But most farmers profited as the 1988 drought reduced crop
yields and drove up prices. This fall, bigger corn yields have
driven down prices of feed grains, making it cheaper to feed
cattle, hogs and chickens but hurting the grain farmers.
   The 1989 corn harvest is up 54 percent from last year's
drought-shriveled crop. Wheat is up 13 percent, and the soybean
crop is 25 percent larger.
   In 1987, according to the department's Economic Research
Service, farmers' net cash income rose to a record $57.7 billion
from $51.8 billion in 1986 and $46.7 billion in 1985.
   The climb marked a turnaround in farm fortunes after falling
land values, high interest rates and heavy debts squeezed hard in
the early 1980s.
   In 1988, net cash income rose further, to $59.9 billion,
reflecting higher crop prices because of the drought, near-record
government payments and sales of stored surpluses.
   This year, with government payments declining, surpluses running
out and farmers spending more to expand crop acreage, net cash
income is expected to decline to $53 billion. In 1990, according to
the latest projections, net cash income may rise to almost $55
billion.
   Net cash income, as defined by the Economic Research Service, is
the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses in a
calendar year. It's money left over that can buy new equipment,
retire debt and support the farm family.
   Another measurement is called net farm income. This includes the
value of farm inventories of grain, cattle, hogs and other
production in a calendar year, along with allowances for other
``non-money'' items such as the value of home-grown food and
existing dwellings.
   By that reckoning, net farm income rose to $32.4 billion in
1985, $38 billion in 1986 and $47.1 billion in 1987. Last year,
according to this method, net farm income declined to $45.7 billion
_ still the second highest on record.
   Net farm income this year is forecast at about $48 billion, and
it may be in the range of $44 billion to $49 billion in 1990.
   These are national figures, and agency analysts are quick to
acknowledge that many farmers are suffering financially, even when
farmers as a group are enjoying the best of times.
   But even some state statistics show farmers have fared better in
recent years than many would have believed likely in the early '80s.
   For example, net cash income increased in 33 states in 1988
despite the drought, even in some of the states that were hardest
hit.
   On the basis of net farm income, which take farmer-held
inventories into account, 27 states showed increases from 1987.
   ``Overall, the country's farm financial performance continued to
improve in 1988, as it had in 1986 and 1987,'' said USDA economist
Mitch Morehart.
   Morehart noted that direct government payments to farmers, which
peaked at $16.7 billion in 1987, dropped 13 percent to $14.5
billion in 1988. The latest estimates put direct payments at $11
billion in 1989 and $8 billion to 11 billion in 1990.
   Annual records kept by the Agriculture Department indicate that
total farm assets, mostly land, have been increasing since they
dropped to $787.1 billion in 1986. The record high was more than
$1.1 trillion in 1981. This year's assets are forecast at $849
billion and may grow to as much as $890 billion in 1990.
   Total farm debt by 1988 was $138 billion and may drop to $136
billion in 1989. In the early and mid-1980s, U.S. farm debt was as
high as $206.5 billion, including family household debt.

   As crews put the finishing touches on
a grandiose central palace that has swallowed billions of dollars,
the masses in Romania's capital scramble to keep warm and to feed
themselves.
   Romanians stop and gape at the exclusive stores lining the
three-mile Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism, which extends
from the base of the towering white Palace of the Republic.
   Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of
retribution, said recently the Palace of the Republic and its
surroundings have cost about eight billion lei _ $800 million at
the official rate _ annually since construction began in 1984.
   Day and night, water spouts from dozens of fountains despite the
energy shortage that keeps radiators cold for most of the day and
private cars idled for lack of gasoline.
   Luxury marble-fronted apartment buildings along the boulevard,
built after about 40,000 people were uprooted, await the arrival of
Communist Party functionaries and their families sometime next year.
   Behind them lie the narrow, muddy streets of the old town, where
shoppers crowd to present identity cards for their ration of eight
ounces of meat a week _ when meat is available.
   A woman behind the counter of a dingy bar recently measured out
glasses of bitters _ the only drink available _ and laughed
derisively when asked for coffee or tea.
   ``Interconti, Interconti,'' she said, pointing in the general
direction of the luxury hotel that is reserved for Westerners
paying in hard currency.
   A sixth winter of strict food and energy rationing looms,
despite expectations of substantial improvements following the
announcement in March that the country is debt-free for the first
time in more than four decades.
   The first winter of privation was in 1983, two years after
maverick Communist President Nicolae Ceausescu launched an all-out
drive to pay off the $11 billion borrowed to industrialize his
agrarian nation.
   As part of the campaign, Romania exported much of what it
produced for hard currency _ including food and refined petroleum
products _ and cut imports to a minimum. The results were
predictable.
   The debt shrank _ Romania managed to pay back an estimated $2.5
billion annually in recent years. But empty shelves, cold and dark
homes, and long lines at gasoline stations became commonplace.
   Romanians, cowed by decades of strict secret police
surveillance, refuse to go on the record with criticisms of the
standard of living. But several raised their eyebrows recently when
told that Ceausescu, in interviews with Western media, denies there
are shortages.
   The authoritarian Ceausescu, who has defied Moscow in the past
and continues to fight the political reforms sweeping Eastern
Europe, is commonly considered to be poorly informed about the real
situation in his country, with fearful aides scrambling to present
a picture that meets his expectations.
   But in October, in a rare move probably triggered by growing
dissatisfaction, the so-called Supreme Leader made an unexpected
tour of poorly stocked Bucharest markets and promised better food
supplies.
   Although Romanians and foreign residents say food supplies have
improved somewhat since then, few appear to expect a real
turnaround _ at least this winter.
   ``The export drive appears to have slackened, but it has bled
the country dry,'' said one Western diplomat who specializes in
economic analysis. ``It's going to take a long time to build up the
kind of surplus needed to offer a steady variety of goods.''
   In addition to meat, eggs, cheese, butter and oil are under
strict ration. Other products such as salami, sausages, flour, corn
meal, toilet paper, napkins, wine and a coffee substitute are sold
only in small quantities, although not formally rationed.
   Random surveys of several butcher shops and grocery stores
recently saw long lines for the single kind of cold cuts available:
a pink, thick-skinned salami.
   In one butcher shop, where customers waiting for deep-frozen
chunks of unidentifiable meat overflowed into the street, a
shabbily dressed older woman complained loudly when told someone
already had picked up her ration.
   Heat also remains scarce. Radiators in centrally heated
buildings were on only five hours a day in early December, and
``even then they're only lukewarm,'' said one resident. Hot water
was available for three hours daily.
   Drivers are allotted about eight gallons of gasoline a month in
some counties. And although lights are somewhat brighter than in
past winters, Bucharest remains dim compared even to other East
European capitals.
   Compounding the hardships are mammoth construction projects
decreed by Ceausescu, the last hard-line Soviet bloc leader, in a
drive to put his imprimature on what state media call the Ceausescu
Epoch.
   Western estimates put a price tag of $2 billion on a 35-mile
canal completed in 1984 linking the Danube above its estuary to the
Black Sea.
   Most of the ships plying the canal are Romanian, and revenues
from user fees have been modest as a result, Western diplomats say.
Construction on another canal of the same magnitude that is to
connect Bucharest to the Danube began in 1987.

<HEAD>Aide to School Superintendent Losing Job After Certificate Disclosure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City School Superintendent J. Herome Harris' top
aide is losing his job because he lacks proper qualifications, and
Harris himself must be recertified to keep his job, the school
board ruled Wednesday.
   The contract of the aide, associate superintendent Ronald H.
Lewis, will not be renewed when it expires Dec. 31, the board
decided during a six-hour meeting Wednesday night.
   State officials said Lewis, Harris' top aide for 15 months,
lacks an approved bachelor of education degree or its equivalent.
   ``He isn't certified, he's in over his head, and there's a big
question about whether we're going to keep him,'' board member Bob
Waymer said earlier.
   Lewis said he had been working to obtain a certificate since he
arrived in Atlanta, but he said he did not know until Monday that
he had been turned down.
   The board also gave Harris until Jan. 1 to get recertified to
keep his job. Harris, who allowed his temporary superintendent's
certification to lapse four months ago, said he needs one college
course to earn a new certificate.
   The course Harris needs is similar to one he taught for 14 years
at Brooklyn College. State rules require that he finish certain
courses within 12 months on the job, but Harris has said he let the
deadline pass because ``I couldn't see myself having to sit in a
class that I taught.''
   The board's resolution, passed unanimously, said Harris should
be reprimanded for not disclosing ``all significant information
concerning the appointment of Dr. Ronald Lewis as associate
superintendent, for not informing the board that his own temporary
certificate had expired on August 31, 1989, and not communicating
openly and effectively with the board of education.''

   While an epidemic of drug-related crime plagues
Detroit, allegations of misuse of a secret police fund used to
fight the drug war are threatening to topple the city's
long-respected police chief.
   William Hart, a former vice cop who has a dozen meritorious
service awards in 37 years on the force, has denied misusing the
$1.4 million fund used to pay informants and finance undercover
drug buys in the nation's seventh-largest city.
   However, records show that he signed checks totaling $72,000 to
California-based companies that paid the rent on a Beverly Hills,
Calif., home occupied by his daughter and son-in-law. A report in
the Detroit Free Press on Tuesday said investigators found several
checks written to cash and signed by Hart.
   The FBI and a federal grand jury are investigating the fund and
a former civilian deputy chief whose whereabouts is unknown. No one
has been charged with a crime.
   ``I had no idea that money was used to pay for a house in
California, Michigan or Ohio, or anywhere else on earth,'' the
65-year-old Hart has said. ``With God as my witness, I swear I did
not do that.
   There have been many calls for Hart to resign or at least step
aside during the probe. A recent poll of Free Press readers found
79 percent in favor of Hart resigning.
   But Mayor Coleman Young, who is Hart's boss, said he is standing
behind the chief. As he has often before, Young blamed the media
for sensationalizing the story.
   ``The man has been tried and convicted without even a chance of
acquittal,'' Young said Monday night at a news conference.
   The City Council voted last week to subpoena 49 checks from the
fund after the Police Department barred Auditor General Roger Short
from seeing them. The department has until Dec. 19 to surrender the
records.
   Young has said he will not release the checks, signed by Hart,
which total more than $1 million. The mayor said they might hamper
confidential police operations.
   Young has assigned Deputy Police Chief James D. Bannon to take
over an internal police investigation that was begun by Hart.
   City officials say they are unsure if Hart is involved with the
alleged mismanagement of funds, but they agree that the pending
investigation could interfere with his job.
   The Police Department was an issue in the recent mayoral
election, which Young won handily. Challenger Tom Barrow said
during the campaign that he would revamp the department and fire
Hart if elected.
   The FBI's investigation focuses on whether top police officials
took money from the secret fund by diverting proceeds to dummy
corporations owned by Kenneth Weiner, a former civilian deputy
police chief.
   Hart has blamed Weiner for the misuse of the funds. He said he
made legal disbursements to Weiner, a former friend, and that
Weiner used the funds illegally.
   ``It's that simple, he stole money,'' Hart said.
   Weiner was in charge of performing sensitive security work for
the city from 1980 to 1986. He left after an investigation into his
involvement with speculative precious metals investments in which
several wealthy Detroit residents allegedly lost thousands of
dollars.
   A federal grand jury has subpoenaed records at the University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor, where Weiner worked as a part-time security
consultant. Weiner's trail has led from Michigan to California to
Georgia.
   The secret fund scandal further taints the Police Department,
which came under fire for drug use by officers.
   Nine of nearly 3,000 police officers screened for drug use
tested positive earlier this year. The Detroit Board of Police
Commissioners suspended six officers for having cocaine in their
urine. Young said three others volunteered for drug treatment
before being tested.
   Drug testing became an issue last year after an off-duty police
officer was shot to death outside a suspected crack house. Around
the same time, 14 other officers were suspended for using drugs.

   The word on the street is that Georgette Watson's
head is worth $5,000. If she's shot and doesn't die, it's $1,000.
   That's how badly street gangs want to get rid of the founder of
Drop-A-Dime, a hot line that fields tips on drug pushers. Watson is
under 24-hour police surveillance and says she can accept that _
for now. But she won't live in a fishbowl forever.
   ``I want to be free,'' she said Wednesday. ``They feel they can
kill anyone who goes against their stance. This is a fight not just
for me, but for the whole community. If we take a stand now we
won't have to pay later.''
   Deputy Superintendent William Celester said police informants
had received ``solid tips'' this week that local gang members had
set a price on Watson's life.
   ``Georgette Watson has ... been getting various threats ever
since she began to speak out about the drug dealers and everything
else,'' he said. ``From time to time, we've offered her police
protection and she's always turned those offers down. This time
we're insisting.''
   The idea of gang bounties is not particularly new. Tensions ran
high this fall when similar threats were made on police officers
patrolling this city's Dorchester, Mattapan and Roxbury
neighborhoods.
   ``Georgette has become a symbol of the little person standing
up,'' Celester said. ``She's been out there standing up for the
community and fighting back. She's become a symbol that these gangs
want to stop.''
   The 46-year-old knows she's in danger but prefers not to think
about it too much. There's something broader and more important at
stake, she said.
   ``They're violating my freedom to take a stand,'' she said. ``We
have to let them know that they will not control this community or
control people they disagree with.''
   Watson is willing temporarily to accept the constant presence of
police, the shadows of two officers parked outside her home each
night. She's willing to stay away from Drop-A-Dime hot line's
office and cancel speaking engagements.
   But the mother of three says she knows who the kids are behind
the bounty offer. She's heard it on the streets and now she's using
those same streets to put out a message of her own.
   ``I want to talk to them,'' Watson said, adding that her only
conditions for the meeting are that it take place in a daylit,
neutral location and that two or three community escorts be present.
   ``I've tried to go out there and meet with them and they refuse
to meet with me,'' she said. ``I'd like to just go up there where
they are with the whole comunity, really send them a message.''
   Since about Nov. 17, Watson said, a different message has been
clear.
   ``I'm worth $1,000 if they shoot me and $5,000 if they kill
me,'' she said. ``They also want a 14-year-old to do it so he won't
have to do any time. They're organized.''
   The bounty offer is good only through Jan. 1, she said.
   The Rev. Bruce Wall, who preaches his anti-gang message at a
local roller-skating rink, heard about the bounty early this week.
If these kids want war, he said, then that's what they'll get.
   ``After I heard, I drove right up to the gang's turf,'' Wall
said. ``I was angry and stopped the first teen-ager I saw walking.
   ``I explained that Georgette Watson was my friend and a certain
youth gang was against her. I also explained that if they attack
Georgette they'll be answering to a lot of angry people and someone
is going to get hurt''
   Community leaders said the gang picked Watson because of her
high profile and the attendant promise of attention.
   ``The word is they're just trying to make a name for themselves
and this will do it,'' Wall said.
   Watson says she is frightened, but resolved.
   ``I've lived a good life,'' she said. ``I love my job, love what
I've done for the community and if this is my time, then this is my
time.''
   It's really only in the evenings that she's frightened. It's in
the evenings, she said, that ``these people do their thing.''

<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thrilling children as Santa Claus was
the delight of Charlie Cather's life, so he will be buried in a
Santa suit.
   For 20 years, Cather was known to children as ``Santa Charlie.''
On Tuesday, the 65-year-old retiree died of complications from
diabetes that confined him to a Huntsville Hospital bed as the
Christmas season approached.
   ``One of the last things he told me, maybe a month ago, was that
he had to turn things around so he could get out and be Santa Claus
again,'' longtime friend Yvonne Meigs said.
   ``Being Santa Claus was one of his greatest delights in life,
and it's so ironic that this had to happen at Christmas. ... when
he was always there for everyone else.''
   In the spring and summer, the retired shoe salesman volunteered
for telethons and other community fund-raisers, playing Santa at
``Christmas in August'' parties for young fans of the Huntsville
Stars baseball team and taking children with cerebral palsy to
ballgames.
   In the fall, Cather began touring with Reindeer Inc., a
Huntsville company that shows reindeer throughout the nation,
before returning home to sit patiently in a shopping mall,
listening to whispered requests and assuring youngsters that Santa
was watching over them as Christmas approached.
   ``Charlie believed in the spirit of love and generosity, the
kind of spirit that touches other people's lives with kindness, the
kind of spirit that is Santa Claus,'' the Rev. Carl Malm, Cather's
pastor for the last 10 years, said as he prepared for Friday's
funeral.
   Cather, who was born in Canton, Ohio, brought his family to
Huntsville about 25 years ago.
   Driving his family home from a trip to Guntersville in 1970,
Cather lost his wife and two of four sons in a fatal wreck. Friends
said he may have turned to Santa Claus to recover from the
emotional impact of the tragedy.
   As Cather's hair turned naturally frosty, he grew a white beard
and his paunch expanded until it shook when he laughed.
   ``He was Santa Claus because he never quit believing,'' Larry
Holder of Reindeer Inc. recalled. ``When you quit believing you get
old. ... and he never quit believing, he had a gleam in his eye
till the very end.''

   President Bush invited Americans to read his
lips, but the first lady moved her lips to get more kids to read,
earning her a place on the list of the world's 12 ``Most Beautiful
Lips.''
   Bo Jackson, Lech Walesa and other lippy leviathans joined
Barbara Bush as winners of the annual tongue-in-cheek awards put
out by Blistex Inc., which knows that while loose lips sink ships,
chapped lips sell Blistex.
   Mrs. Bush captured the ``best-read lips'' honor.
   ``We felt Barbara Bush was doing more than her husband,
particularly to encourage reading literacy,'' said Richard K.
Green, the company's executive vice president.
   When it came to ships, Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl was named
``slickest lips'' for his public statements after the March 28
Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   Walesa, the leader of Poland's Solidarity labor movement, made
the list with the ``most solid lips,'' even though his lips are
often hidden by his walrus mustache.
   Jackson, star of the football's Los Angeles Raiders and
baseball's Kansas City Royals, took the trophy for his
``double-duty lips.''
   And Wayne Gretzky of the National Hockey League's Los Angeles
Kings scored with the ``most pointed lips.'' Gretzky, who broke
Gordie Howe's all-time NHL scoring record this year, is the only
person ever to make the list twice in its 10-year history, Green
said.
   Late night talk show host Arsenio Hall had the ``hippest lips,''
while Oprah Winfrey the ``fast-est lips'' for sharing her diet
results on her daytime talk show.
   Roseanne Barr, meanwhile, got the ``most no-holds-Barred lips''
award for her hit sitcom and best-selling autobiography, and
``Today'' show news anchor Deborah Norville made it for ``today's
lips.''
   Movie star Michelle Pfeiffer was rated ``fabulips'' for her role
in the film ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   ``Whose lips?'' belonged to Peter Townshend of the rock group
The Who, which made a reunion tour, while the ``most far-sided
lips'' were those of cartoonist Gary Larson, whose ``The Far Side''
appears in more than 900 daily newspapers.
   The lips list was begun in 1980 to make people think about lip
care during the winter, Green said.
   ``We wouldn't take someone who didn't have good-lookng lips, but
it has more to do with their involvement in the news,'' he said.

   A shopping mall Santa sprang from his chair,
performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a choking boy and didn't
even loose his wig.
   Dorie Schuffman was paying to have her son Renny photographed
with Santa Seth Appelgate when the 11-year-old boy started coughing
and collapsed.
   ``Santa Claus just leaped out of the chair,'' said Ms.
Schuffman, of Reseda ``I didn't know what was happening.''
   Applegate, 37, was working in the Panorama Mall on Tuesday when
Reny began coughing.
   ``He passed out in front of me. He turned completely red,''
Applegate said Wednesday. ``My first reaction was to just get some
air into this little guy.''
   Applegate, who had emergency medical training years ago, had
trouble with the big wig and beard but kept them on as he worked on
Renny.
   ``I had dozens of children standing around and I didn't want to
blow their illusion,'' he said.
   The boy apparently had gotten bubble gum stuck in his throat,
Applegate said.

   A sea of gleaming brass bobbed in unison for
a holiday concert that might best be described as, like, totally
tuba-ular.
   Two hundred musicians clutching the imposing instruments offered
the unusual ``Merry TubaChristmas'' program Tuesday at the elegant
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
   Elephantine sousaphones were positioned at the top of a
staircase. Below were double-belled euphoniums, smaller orchestral
tubas, and even an ophicleide, an instrument that preceded the tuba
more than 150 years ago.
   ``I can't even hear myself, but I know I'm playing,'' said
Roland Boyer, 13.
   Santa's ho-ho-ho seems most suitable for the deep, throaty
horns. But the scores of tuba players made a joyful noise in the
program organized by Indiana University music professor Harvey
Phillips, who conceived of the idea in 1974 as a tribute to the
great tuba composers.
   The hourlong Christmas concert now plays in more than 100 cities.

   Bob Grimes has been offered sex in return for
car tows and repairs. Frank Ferra had to turn down a 400-pound hog.
Seems like a tow truck in need is a friend, indeed.
   Grimes and Ferra are garage managers whose work includes
servicing vehicles on the 470-miles Pennsylvania Turnpike, where
about 30,000 vehicles broke down last year.
   Sometimes what they're offered by motorists strapped for cash
when the bill arrives is a jump start in itself.
   ``When it's late at night and they need gas or something like
that,'' there's no limit to what motorists will offer for a tow,
said Grimes, manager of Smeltz Auto Body and Towing in Monroeville.
``I never took them up on it.''
   Ferra got a wedding ring from a man who put it up as collateral
for repairs made to his car. He never returned.
   ``That ring was worth $30. His bill was $75. We ate that one,''
said Ferra, owner of Ferra Automotive Services in Sharpsburg.
   On rare occasions, the services will accept collateral from
motorists who don't have cash, credit cards or checks to pay for
towing or repairs.
   Usually motorists offer things like watches and spare tires. But
there are exceptions.
   ``I've had guys leave their wives at the shop and run to the
bank to get money,'' said Ed Reese, owner of Reese's Towing.
   ``They all came back,'' he said.

   Santa howled ``bribery!'' when Mrs. Claus
placed brightly colored gifts in front of the judge. But that
didn't stop a judgment authorizing Mrs. Claus to share gift-giving
Christmas rights with her husband.
   Judge George T. Choppelas also declared their sleigh ``community
property,'' changed Mrs. Claus' title to ``Ms.,'' and declared her
``emancipated from any household duties'' and free to accompany her
large spouse on his airborne tours of the world.
   A courtroom jammed with spectators, reporters and photographers
broke into cheers Wednesday at the conclusion of a rather unruly
and holiday-happy 60th session of San Francisco's mock Court of
Historical Review.
   The just-for-fun court is a 14-year San Francisco tradition
staged in a real City Hall courtroom, with a real judge, real
lawyers, clerks and stenographers. Only the witnesses are phony.
   Watching with interest were Municipal Court Judge Diane Wick,
dressed as a female Santa, and lawyer Robert J. McCarthy,
pillow-paunched with a tatty white beard and wig. He sat on the
lady Santa's lap.
   ``It's obvious that Santa Claus is a woman,'' claimed San
Francisco Supervisor Angela Alioto, who insisted that the Italian
female Santa Claus, ``Befana,'' leaps down chimneys to dole out
toys to good kids, and chunks of coal to the bad ones.

<HEAD>North Doesn't Want to Testify Against Poindexter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the biggest case of their investigation
fast approaching, Iran-Contra prosecutors are trying to turn Oliver
North into a witness for the government.
   North said Wednesday he does not want to testify against his
former boss, ex-national security adviser John Poindexter.
   Poindexter, scheduled to go on trial Jan. 22, was ``the only one
... who didn't hang Ollie North out to dry'' during the
congressional Iran-Contra hearings, North said at a pre-trial
hearing in the Poindexter case.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene will decide whether
North was tainted by Poindexter's immunized congressional testimony
and cannot testify at his criminal trial.
   ``This is the fourth Christmas that my family has had its door
darkened'' by the independent counsel's investigation and
prosecution of the Iran-Contra affair, North complained.
   North ``is not a friendly witness, not to the independent
counsel,'' Greene observed.
   But prosecutors need North's testimony.
   It was Poindexter who directed North to step into a meeting with
congressmen where he lied about assisting the Contras.
   ``Well done,'' Poindexter said in a follow-up computer message
after the Aug. 6, 1986, meeting.
   North suggested Poindexter was unaware of North's false answers
when the national security adviser, who hadn't attended the
meeting, sent the computer message.
   At one point during the seven hours of testimony from North this
week, Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb emphasized that Poindexter
had received a written summary of North's comments before sending
the computer message. Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress
in connection with the denials about Contra assistance.
   North watched as Poindexter tore up a presidential finding on
Nov. 20, 1986, an aspect of four of the criminal charges against
Poindexter.
   North quickly agreed with defense attorney Richard Beckler that
he hadn't actually seen what document Poindexter had torn up.
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Michael Bromwich brought out that the
document destruction was preceded by Poindexter and North
discussing the finding. The politically embarrassing document,
depicting the Iran initiative as a straight arms-for-hostages deal,
referred to knowledge by the Reagan administration of previous arms
shipments to Iran.
   Entering the fourth year of its investigation, the office of
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has been forced to rely on a
series of reluctant witnesses.
   Testimony from North's loyal secretary, Fawn Hall, was crucial
to prosecutors in proving that North altered documents.
   Former CIA employee Glenn Robinette was accused by prosecutors
of giving misleading answers on a witness stand. Yet Robinette's
testimony was critical in the conviction of North for accepting a
$13,800 home security system.
   This week, North said his perceptions of the Iran-Contra affair
had been influenced by Poindexter's Capitol Hill testimony, given
under a grant of immunity.
   Bromwich suggested North is falsely raising the taint issue so
that he will be disqualified by the judge as a government witness
in the Poindexter case. North denied it, although he acknowledged,
``I am familiar with the (legal) concept'' of taint.
   North is raising the issue in the appeal of his three felony
convictions in the Iran-Contra scandal. He contends his immunized
testimony tainted the government's criminal case against him.

<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 7 grafs with background on U.S. evacuations during coup,
warnings that mutineers might turn to terrorism.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unidentified assailants fired two
rifle grenades Thursday at a U.S. government residential compound,
causing minor damage and no injuries, U.S. officials said.
   There was no indication of who fired the grenades, which
exploded about noon at the Seafront compound. But the incident
occurred following threats against U.S. interests by rebel soldiers
whose coup attempt failed last week.
   A U.S. Embassy statement said the grenades were fired
``indiscriminately'' at the compound, which includes the American
club, an embassy commissary and housing areas for embassy and
military personnel.
   Embassy spokesman David Andriessen said Americans had been
warned to avoid travel to the embassy compound and other U.S.
installations in the capital for the next few hours.
   During the recent coup attempt, hundreds of American families
were evacuated to Seafront to escape fighting between mutineers and
government forces in the financial district, Makati.
   Rebels who sought to topple President Corazon Aquino expressed
anger at the United States after American F-4 Phantom jets flew air
cover for government forces on Dec.1, the first day of the coup
attempt.
   U.S. jets did not fire a shot but their presence was considered
crucial in turning the tide against mutineers, who had launched air
attacks against Malacanang Palace and military camps.
   Rebels gave up their last position Saturday when about 400
mutineers surrendered at an air base near Cebu, 350 miles south of
the capital.
   On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said remnants of the
rebel force still retain the capability to launch ``terrorist
attacks, sabotage and assassination.''
   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, chief of the Capital Command, said
there ``are indications that they are moving'' toward terrorism to
continue the struggle against Mrs. Aquino.
   ``I hope they will be reasonable enough that they will be men of
conscience,'' Aguirre said. ``They should not resort to terrorist
acts that will prejudice innocent lives.''

<HEAD>Aerospace Industries See Moderate Decline in More Peaceful World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The aerospace industry is marking record sales
but is ``braced for heavy weather'' in future years with the
prospect of peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union, an industry
leader says.
   Aerospace industries are likely to decline in sales volume over
the next decade, according to a year-end industry report by the
Aerospace Industries Association.
   This year's record sales are due primarily to delivery of
military aircraft and related equipment that were ordered in
previous years and to a boom in commercial airliner sales,
association president Don Fuqua said Wednesday.
   Long-range declines are expected as a result of the prospect of
peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union and predicted defense
budget cuts, Fuqua said. Much of the decline will be offset by
gains in civil aviation and commercial space programs, but the
overall result will be a modest decline, he said.
   ``I do not minimize the impact on our industry of the defense
spending cuts we know are coming,'' Fuqua said. ``We are braced for
heavy weather, particularly among those AIA member companies most
deeply committed to defense work.''
   ``We do not expect impact of catastrophic dimension but rather a
moderate decline in real, inflation-adjusted sales volume,'' Fuqua
said. ``The United States is not going to abdicate its global
defense responsibilities, nor is the defense industry going out of
business.''
   The association also released the results of a survey which
showed that 67 percent of its responding members, including most of
the country's major aeronautical corporations, have a shortage of
scientists and engineers and 55 percent report a shortage of
production workers. More than 80 percent said they expect more
shortages in the future.
   The problem is made more serious by rapid changes in the
technology needed in aerospace industries, by a lack of young
people preparing for jobs with a technological focus, by the
failure of women and minorities to choose such careers and by the
fact that U.S. students generally are doing poorly in science and
math, said the AIA study.
   Fuqua and the report noted that U.S. students don't measure up
to their foreign counterparts in science and math and fewer are
entering those fields.
   The aerospace official predicted that defense sales will be
significantly lower in the 1990s than in the decade just ending.
But, he said, ``we're declining from an all-time peak.''
   The industry will set a sales record in 1989 of $120.6 billion,
and AIA is projecting another overall sales record next year of
$137 billion, Fuqua said.
   He said the statistics are based mostly on deliveries because
there is a long lead time between the time an order is placed and a
major aerospace system is delivered.
   ``The growing prospects for peaceful coexistence with the Soviet
Union and the Warsaw Pact nations will exert an additional downward
pressure on the defense budget,'' Fuqua said.
   But that will be offset partly by other opportunities for
aerospace manufacturers, he said, including development of the U.S.
space station, new emphasis on space science and a technology
effort for missions to the moon, Mars and other bodies of the solar
system.
   The expected upturn in 1990 arises mostly from a ``dramatic
increase in commercial aircraft deliveries,'' Fuqua said. Jetliner
manufacturers are several years behind on their orders.
   ``Market surveys suggest that airline traffic will double by the
year 2005 and that the world's airlines will need some 8,500 new
transports to handle the growth and replace older aircraft,'' he
said.
   Civil aircraft sales for 1989 will top $20 billion, a record
that will be broken next year when they will go beyond $32 billion,
Fuqua said.

   A lawsuit in federal district court faults the
Social Security Administration for failing to establish a required
homeless outreach program, but the agency insists it has aggressive
plans to reach the needy.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia, charges that the agency illegally failed to
act on 1987 legislation requiring it to offer grants to states for
demonstration programs to help the homeless obtain federal benefits.
   The suit maintains that thousands of homeless people who are
elderly or disabled are incapable of applying for the Supplemental
Security Income benefits to which they are entitled, making it
essential for the government to provide special outreach programs.
   SSI provides a minimum income to 4.5 million low-income blind,
aged and disabled people. Maximum monthly benefits are $368 for an
individual and $553 for a couple this year, rising to $386 and
$579, respectively, in 1990.
   An estimated 25 percent of the nation's homeless are mentally
disabled, another 10 percent are physically disabled and 20 percent
are elderly, according to the lawsuit.
   The suit was filed by the National Law Center on Homelessness
and Poverty, the states of Michigan and Massachusetts, homeless
Washingtonian Ramon Willis, Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif.,
and two local organizations that offer help to the homeless.
   Social Security spokesman Phil Gambino said the agency had not
seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it directly.
   However, he stressed that Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn
King has been on the job just five months and ``is committed to an
aggressive SSI outreach program to both the homeless as well as the
aged and disabled.''
   Gambino said Mrs. King had worked with Congress to obtain a $3
million appropriation for a broad outreach program in fiscal 1990
that will include grants to states. This program is not targeted
exclusively toward the homeless, but will include the homeless as
well as other aged and disabled individuals, he said.
   Congress authorized $1.25 million for fiscal 1988 and $2.5
million for fiscal 1989 for homeless outreach. The lawsuit charges
that the Department of Health and Human Services, of which the
Social Security Administration is a part, ``decided on its own that
Congress had made a poor choice and that the (outreach) program was
`not needed.'''
   The suit said Michigan and Massachusetts were ``ready, willing
and able'' to participate in a program with HHS to reach homeless
people in those states.
   It said Willis is entitled to receive SSI benefits ``but has
been unable to secure such benefits due to the physical and
psychological trauma he has suffered as a result of his infection
with the AIDS virus.''
   ``Although he is very interested in applying for SSI benefits,
he knows nothing about the program and has no idea how to go about
applying.''

<HEAD>Blind Man Practiced Law Until Death at 99</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHWAUK, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney M.B. ``Ben'' Rustan tried to
negotiate a 20-year lease for his law office back in 1981, when he
was 91 years old.
   When he turned 99, he told a bank cashier he wanted to buy the
longest term certificates of deposit possible.
   Rustan expected to be practicing law July 4, on his 100th
birthday.
   But the man who hung his law shingle in this Iron Range town of
northwestern Minnesota in 1918 died Sunday of a heart seizure.
   What made Rustan's achievements even more remarkable was the
fact he was blind. His eyes were removed when he was 5 as the
result of spinal meningitis. He wore glasses with frosted lenses.
   But no one seems to mention his blindness until they've talked
about how dedicated to his job he was, how meticulous in dress he
was, how serious he was.
   He couldn't be considered an elder statesman because he never
retired. But he garnered that type of respect. It was appropriate
that his home address was 1 First St.
   Rustan suffered the seizure, his first serious one, Nov. 28 in a
car on his way to work with his secretary.
   He was buried Wednesday.
   ``He certainly was a credit to his profession,'' longtime friend
Nick Dasovich told The Duluth News-Tribune. ``There's one word to
describe him: sharp. Age didn't take a toll on his mind.''
   ``In all the years that he practiced law, to the best of my
knowledge, he never had a dissatisfied client, much less a
malpractice claim,'' said District Judge John A. Spellacy of nearby
Grand Rapids. ``Even had he not been blind, he would have been
considered an outstanding lawyer in all departments.''
   ``He never thought of himself as old; maybe that was his
secret,'' said Vicky Shofner, Rustan's secretary the past 17 years.
   Shofner said her boss worked a 40-hour week and checked into the
office on Saturdays and Sundays.
   Rustan worked mainly in real estate transactions, transfers of
deeds and titles. When he went to the courtroom, he took Braille
notes with a slate and stylus, a pick-like instrument that punches
holes in paper held by the slate. He dictated his documentation to
Shofner.
   Herb Latvala, president of First National Bank, worked with
Rustan on many matters.
   ``I think the greatest service he provided for people around
here were that his fees were so reasonable,'' Latvala said. ``He
never overcharged anyone. People will miss him for many reasons.''

<HEAD>Bush to Attend Drug Summit in Colombia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, in a gesture of personal
solidarity for Colombia's battle against the drug cartels, will
join the leaders of the Andean nations in Cartagena, Colombia, on
Feb. 15 for a one-day summit on the drug war.
   Cartagena, a port city 680 miles north of Bogota, is located in
a Medellin cartel stronghold in a country ravaged by bombings and
assassinations since Colombian President Virgilio Barco declared
war on the drug traffickers three months ago.
   The White House played down security concerns Wednesday as it
formally announced Bush's plan to go to Colombia.
   ``We won't take him where it isn't safe,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   He insisted the security challenge in Colombia is less
formidable than at the annual economic summits with the major
industrialized countries, where seven heads of state require
protection.
   ``We've had heavy security lots of places,'' Fitzwater said.
   The plan is for a one-day summit, meaning neither Bush nor his
large entourage will require lodging in Colombia. Fitzwater said it
was always intended to be a one-day affair.
   The drug terrorists are blamed for a bombing outside a police
building in Bogota last week that killed 63. A judge, a prosecutor
and a bank official were assassinated Tuesday night in Colombia.
   Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson is currently
leading a U.S. delegation to the Andean nations to lay the
groundwork for the February meeting.
   The other participants, in addition to Bush and Barco, will be
President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of
Bolivia.
   On Monday, Bush expressed determination to attend the South
American summit, but said, ``I will not do anything imprudent.''
   Praising Barco for battling the drug cartel, Bush said, ``I
don't want to undermine the courageous stances he's taking. ... And
I don't want to be the one that sends a signal that nobody should
go to Colombia because they can't be protected.''
   One top administration official said the drug summit probably
will be held at a Colombian naval base. The official said that for
better security the entire Washington entourage, including staff
and reporters, would remain at the same location instead of
operating from a separate site than the talks, as is often the case
on presidential foreign trips.
   Earlier Wednesday Bush signed legislation authorizing $240
million in aid for Colombia, Bolivia and Peru to help wage the
fight against drugs in the region where most of the world's cocaine
is produced.
   The legislation authorizes spending $115 million for narcotics
control assistance and $125 million for military and law
enforcement aid to the three countries.
   The violence in Colombia shows the drug cartels ``are entrenched
and powerful. International cooperation is essential if they are to
be defeated, and the United States, in particular, must be generous
in providing assistance,'' Bush said.
   The measure waives restrictions on using U.S. foreign aid to
train police.
   Meanwhile, Bush's drug policy chief, William Bennett, labeled
``stupid and morally atrocious'' a call to legalize cocaine, heroin
and other illicit drugs.
   U.S. District Judge Robert H. Sweet, a former Republican
prosecutor, made the proposal in a speech in New York, joining such
figures as former Secretary of State George Shultz in arguing that
prohibition has failed and legalizing drugs would curb the violence.
   ``It doesn't make any sense,'' responded Bennett.
   Elsewhere, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, proposed a $1 billion research effort to find
medical ways to reduce addicts' craving for cocaine and other drugs.
   Also, a Gallup poll released Wednesday said 60 percent of
American workers favor drug testing by their firms. The poll,
released by the Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace, said 24
percent reported they had seen or heard of drug use by co-workers
on the job, while 31 percent said such use occurred outside
business hours.
   The institute includes 14 large corporations concerned about
employer rights in battling drug abuse.
   The Gallup Organization interviewed a random sample of 1,007
full-time workers around the nation last month, including
professional, blue collar and clerical workers. The survey had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.

   He's also taking advantage of an upswell in nostalgia for
``Lucy'' since the April death of his TV mother, Lucille Ball, and
is appearing on a half dozen national TV shows to talk about her
legacy.
   Thibodeaux, 39, is the only surviving member of the ``I Love

until 1960 _ were Desi Arnaz, who died in 1986; Vivian Vance, dead
in 1979; and William Frawley, who died in 1966.
   Other children also portrayed Little Ricky as an infant.
Thibodeaux was the only Little Ricky with speaking lines. ``I Love

   A magistrate ruled that Miss West
Virginia was in the right when she pulled a gun on another woman
who had kicked out the window of her car and pulled her hair in a
late-night fight over a man.
   Marion County Magistrate C. Frank Jones dismissed a charge of
brandishing against Lisa Bittinger, 21, saying she had a right to
show the small-calibre handgun during the Nov. 7 tussle with Tammy
Boyce, 23.
   ``If someone has you by the hair, and you just momentarily bring
it into view to scare them off, that's not brandishing,'' Jones
said.
   Bittinger and Boyce argued at a bar over a man who Bittinger is
dating and Boyce dated some years ago, according to testimony.
Bittinger testified that Boyce chased her in another car when they
left the establishment, smashed into her car and then attacked her.
   In a separate ruling, Jones found Boyce guilty of reckless
driving, battery and destruction of property. She was sentenced to
concurrent terms of 120 days in jail and freed on bond until Dec.
27.
   ``I wanted to give her time to enjoy her holiday,'' Jones said.
``This whole thing was really just a cat fight.''

<HEAD>Subsidies Boost U.S. Wheat Sales Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Agriculture Department economists say
subsidized sales of wheat have helped boost the volume of wheat
sold overseas and have generally been good for farmers.
   But the net financial gain has not been large because of the
costs to carry out the subsidies under the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP, which began in 1985.
   ``Analysis shows that U.S. wheat exports, prices and gross
export revenues rose due to the EEP,'' the report said. ``The gain
in export revenues slightly exceeded the value to the U.S.
Government of the commodities offered as bonuses.''
   Under the program, designated foreign countries can buy
specified U.S. commodities _ wheat has been the main item _ at
prices lower than otherwise would be charged. The private exporters
then are given surplus commodities held by USDA to make up for the
lower prices charged the foreign buyers.
   As of Dec. 7, since the program began, a total of 87.2 million
metric tons of grain have been sold overseas under EEP
arrangements. Wheat made up 65.5 million tons of the total.
Overall, the commodities sold were valued at more than $9.2
billion. The subsidies, or bonuses, cost $2.64 billion.
   The report by the department's Economic Research Service
compared several research studies of EEP in an attempt to sort out
the program's contribution to wheat exports during 1985-88.
   ``U.S. prices rose slightly due to the EEP,'' the report said.
``Higher wheat prices improved market earnings for U.S. wheat
growers and reduced government outlays for direct income payments
to U.S. farmers.''
   One of the studies reviewed by USDA economists Ann Hillberg
Seitzinger and Philip L. Paarlberg showed that the volume of wheat
exports rose 2 percent to 3 percent early in the EEP campaign.
   Another showed an increase of 20 percent from June 1986 to May
1987, and one put the wheat export increase at 10 percent to 30
percent from July 1986 to June 1987. Gains of 12 percent to 14
percent, and one of 7 percent through May 1988 also were cited.
   One of the purposes of the program was to counteract similar
subsidized exports by the European Economic Community.
   ``EEP wheat sales to some countries replaced unsubsidized
commercial sales,'' the report said. ``Competitors displaced from
markets targeted for EEP sales sometimes moved into other markets
where the United States previously had been a major supplier.''
   The analysis said that increases in U.S. wheat exports and
market prices resulted in larger gross export revenues.
   ``But net U.S. export revenues changed only slightly once the
value of the commodities from government inventories awarded to
exporters under the EEP was weighed against the benefits to wheat
exports and prices,'' the report said.

   Three families from Indiana, Kentucky and Utah
were announced today as winners in a national awards program to
recognize outstanding farm conservationists.
   The awards are presented annually by the National Endowment for
Soil and Water Conservation and are funded by the Du Pont Co.,
which presented the winners each with a $1,000 cash award at a
dinner Monday night.
   Winners for 1989 are: David and Beverly Salomon Churubusco,
Ind.; Rick and Stacy Murdock, Murray, Ky.; and Frank W. Bohman,
Morgan, Utah.
   The national winners during the week are meeting with
Agriculture Department and Environmental Protection Agency
officials, members of Congress and others. A visit to the White
House for presentation of awards certificates also is on the
schedule.
   Chairman Emmett Barker, president of the Farm and Industrial
Equipment Institute, said the winners prove that soil and water
conservation can be achieved voluntarily and that it is ``good
stewardship and good business.''
   John A. Krol of Du Pont said that on farms and ranches ``as in
every corporation in America we need vision instead of mere
compliance.'' He said Dupont shares the winners' ``zeal to excel in
environmental performance.''
   The National Endowment for Soil and Water Conservation says it
was founded in 1982 as a non-profit, privately funded,
non-political organization ``dedicated to conserving natural
resources and promoting a sense of stewardship for the land by all
Americans.''

   The head of a House Armed Services
investigative panel contends the Navy irresponsibly rushed to
judgment in citing gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig as likely to blame
for the USS Iowa shipboard explosion.
   Summing up two days of hearings on the blast that killed 47
sailors, Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., told Vice Adm. Joseph S.
Donnell III ``you've pointed your finger when there's that little
chance'' the blast could have been accidental.
   ``Wouldn't it have been better off to say `we don't know,'''
Mavroules asked the vice admiral.
   ``We believe we do know,'' Donnell said, alluding to the Navy's
finding that Hartwig most likely caused the blast by inserting some
type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's
16-inch guns.
   ``I find it quite irresponsible that the Navy would issue a
report on a probable cause rather than have the documented evidence
that they can prove,'' Mavroules said.
   Mavroules made the statement after Hartwig's onetime friend and
shipmate, Kendall Truitt, testified _ with the backing of another
sailor _ that he thought the gun-turret explosion was an accident.
   ``Clayton Michael Hartwig did not cause the explosion,'' Truitt
said. ``I do not think he committed suicide. I believe the report
is very misleaing.''
   ``It's a big coverup, in my opinion,'' he said. ``Clayton
Hartwig was not the suicidal freak they make him out to be.''
   As members of Hartwig's family looked on, Truitt and Petty
Officer John Mullahy disputed the Navy's finding, citing personal
observations about Hartwig and concerns about technical problems
aboard the Iowa.
   Mullahy said that on the night before the explosion, he and
Hartwig discussed his impending transfer to London and the seaman
even made a list of the items he needed to buy.
   In addition, Hartwig didn't learn until the morning of the blast
that he was going to be at the center gun in the No. 2 turret, ``so
there would have been not time for planning'' a suicide, Truitt
said.
   Mullahy and Truitt were part of the crew engaged in the firing
exercises that day. Both repeated the last words of Petty Officer
Eric Lawrence, who was in the center gun position with Hartwig.
   ``He (Lawrence) wouldn't have had as his last words, `I'm not
ready (to fire) yet. We've got a problem in here,''' Truitt said.
   ``He would have said, `Hey, excuse me guys, he put a bomb in
here,''' Truitt said.
   ``It tells me the situation was not dangerous, was not
life-threatening. If Clay was going to blow up the ship, Lawrence
would have stopped him. They were literally standing shoulder to
shoulder.''
   Truitt said his theory is that the blast was caused by a
defective hydraulic rammer _ the piece of equipment used to shove
the powder bags up against the projectile.
   He said he had a problem with a rammer on the left gun in No. 2
gun turret about a year earlier, describing it as behaving like a
transmission stuck between neutral and drive. He theorized that the
rammer might have ``suddenly taken off,'' putting too much pressure
on the propellant.
   Mullahy, who has served in the Navy for 19 years and was
assigned to the Iowa in December 1988, said a possible explanation
for the explosion could be found in the World War II-era gun powder
bags that were improperly stored.
   Navy officers have said that while some safety lapses were
discovered in the course of the investigation, there was no
substantial risk involving the 16-inch guns and the powder used to
fire them.
   During the course of the hearing, Mullahy said Hartwig and
Truitt did not talk to each other for several months, although
Truitt was the beneficiary on Hartwig's $101,000 life insurance
policy.
   ``They hated each other,'' Mullahy said.
   Nevertheless, Hartwig never had Truitt removed as the
beneficiary on the policy. Truitt said that in settlement of the
policy claim, he gave Hartwig's family $2,500, his lawyer $40,000,
and kept the rest.

direct dialed, data and video services onto the Soviet Intersputnik
satellite system for the first time.
   AT&amp;T currently has the only Western phone facilities to the
Soviet Union, with other long distance companies leasing space on
AT&amp;T lines. The traffic is carried on 32 circuits by undersea cable
and land lines, as well as the Intelsat satellite consortium.
   Despite these links, which since last month has included AT&amp;T
direct dial service to Moscow, ``demand still far exceeds existing
capacity,'' the phone company said.
   AT&amp;T plans to add 24 more circuits in January, and ``the
proposal we made today could add as many as 150 additional
circuits,'' AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said.
   The plan would require construction of a new $1 million antenna
at AT&amp;T's Roaring Creek earth station near Catawissa, Pa., Linnen
said.
   It would take six months to construct the antenna, which then
would be aimed at an Intersputnik satellite located in a
geostationary orbit 22,300 miles above a point just off the coast
of Liberia.
   Intersputnik is a consortium of 15 socialist countries that
provides satellite-delivered communications among its member
nations. Currently, Cable News Network uses Intersputnik for
satellite news feeds, Linnen noted.
   In a letter to President Bush announcing its new plan, AT&amp;T
Chairman Robert Allen said, ``Expanded communications capacity will
result in direct economic benefits to the United States as we
expand world trade through commercial relationships with Eastern
Europe.''
   Linnen said presidential approval was not needed for the plan,
which he said did not involve any national security issues such as
transferring high-tech equipment to communist nations.
   He said the plan, which was negotiated over the past 12 months,
was forwarded to Bush as a ``matter of courtesy'' given Bush's
statements since the Malta summit on improving U.S.-Soviet
relations.
   An AT&amp;T-Intersputnik link would be a blow to Intelsat, the
117-nation satellite cooperative that handles the bulk of
international telephone traffic. Intelsat recently launched the
first of a series of five new satellites it plans to put aloft over
the next two years to handle increasing international
communications traffic.
   AT&amp;T said the Soviets prefer using their own satellites for
additional circuits because Moscow then incurs expenses solely
within the Soviet Union, payable in rubles rather than in Western
currencies. Rubles are not traded officially in international money
markets.
   Intelsat officials would not comment Wednesday.
   Under the proposal, AT&amp;T and the Soviets would continue to use
Intelsat for some circuits and would split future increases in
demand for circuits among undersea cables, Intelsat satellites and
Intersputnik satellites.

<HEAD>Watkins Says Weapons Plant Shutdown Won't Ease Waste Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent shutdown of the nation's only
producer of purified plutonium for nuclear weapons could last two
months or longer, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins says.
   In his most specific comments about the Rocky Flats plant's
outlook since it completed a phased closure of plutonium operations
earlier this month, Watkins said Wednesday it was too early to set
a date for restarting the troubled facility.
   ``I hope we'll be back on in a couple of months'' he told
reporters during a break in a hearing on national energy policy
options.
   The indefinite shutdown was considered necessary to review
safety procedures and to perform an annual plant plutonium
inventory. A restart date is expected to be announced next month.
   Outside inspectors have raised many safety-related questions
about Rocky Flats operations in recent weeks. The FBI in June
raided the plant, located near Denver, to search for evidence of
possible criminal violations of environmental laws.
   The plant's future is further jeopardized by the accumulation of
plutonium wastes beyond a 1,600 cubic yard limit set by Colorado
Gov. Roy Romer. The limit is projected to be reached in April 1990,
and Rocky Flats may have to be closed down then unless Watkins can
find another site to store the excess waste.
   In response to reporters' questions, Watkins said the current
closure at Rocky Flats would not give him more time to resolve the
waste storage problem unless the shutdown lasted more than about
two months. That is because the plutonium inventory itself will
result in more waste than if the plant were operating normally,
Watkins said.
   ``It's a wash,'' on waste accumulation if the shutdown is for
two months, he said.
   If the closure lasts longer, the waste problem could be eased,
but Watkins has asserted that a lengthy shutdown of Rocky Flats
would endanger U.S. national security because it is the only source
of purified plutonium for warheads.
   In a related development Wednesday, an Energy Department
advisory panel told Watkins there ``appears to be acceptable
confidence'' that a long-delayed permanent dump for the Rocky Flats
wastes can meet national environmental standards.
   The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, an underground waste repository
near Carlsbad, N.M., is supposed to be the long-range answer to
plutonium waste disposal but it has been repeatedly delayed by
political and scientific uncertainties.
   The advisory panel told Watkins in a letter released Wednesday
that he should go ahead with plans to put limited amounts of
plutonium waste in the repository for testing purposes as soon as
he is confident that environmental standards eventually can be met.
   Watkins has said the New Mexico facility will not open at least
until next July.

<HEAD>US Adds $200 Million to Loan Plan for Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is pumping $200
million into a loan package to carry Poland beyond the Christmas
season, and challenging wealthy nations to make good on promises of
aid to Warsaw and Hungary.
   Trying to bolster the process of democratic reforms in Eastern
Europe, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said, ``pledges alone
aren't enough.''
   Baker, speaking in Brussels to a gathering of two dozen foreign
ministers, joined the White House in announcing a $200 million
contribution to a multi-nation, $500 million loan for Poland as it
awaits a comprehensive aid package from the International Monetary
Fund.
   The loan ``reflects support for Poland's economic reform program
designed to restore sustained growth,'' said deputy presidential
press secretary Stephen Hart.
   Other countries contributing are Belgium, Canada, West Germany,
France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and
Britain, the Treasury Department said.
   The loan is in addition to a previously announced $1 billion
stabilization fund for Poland. The United States is contributing a
$200 million grant for that.
   In addition, President Bush last month signed a $938 million aid
package over three years for Poland and Hungary. Most of the money
is earmarked for Warsaw.
   Referring to the fall of hardline communist governments in
Eastern Europe, Baker said, ``It is our task to support this
courageous reform effort.
   ``After the streets empty of demonstrators, after the people
select new leaders, after governments become the servants of the
people, after all this _ the economies must put food on the table
and goods on the shelves of stores,'' he said.
   The foreign ministers in Brussels committed their governments to
a coordinated assistance program valued at up to $6 billion over
the next several years.
   Most of the aid will be in the form of investment and trade
credits not to be paid out immediately.
   On Capitol Hill, Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said
that more than money, Poland needs a Western-style legal system,
accounting system, banking system, marketing and distribution
systems and the private ownership of assets.
   ``Poland will not be able to attract foreign investment until
the institution building takes place,'' said Yeutter, who recently
led a high-level U.S. delegation to Warsaw to assess its economic
needs.
   ``As important as all of our aid programs may be, Poland really
needs people help, institutional help, more than it needs monetary
assistance,'' Yeutter said. ``Without that, it will be wasted, it
will be money lost.''
   He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Speaking to reporters later, Yeutter acknowledged that ``some
assistance will be of help'' in helping Poland to deal with its
immediate problems.
   ``But it's not just a matter of throwing money at Poland,'' he
said. ``The situation in Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe is
not comparable to Western Europe immediately after World War II''
when the United States organized the Marshall Plan to spur economic
recovery.
   Contrary to Yeutter's testimony, economist John Kenneth
Galbraith told the Senate panel that a Marshall Plan is precisely
what is needed, and needed soon.
   ``There is a notion as regards Poland, as also regards to the
Soviet Union and other socialist countries, that such is the magic
of the market that a movement in that direction will produce
immediate and quite wonderful results,''
   ``This, to put it bluntly, is idiot ideology,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cast Reunion Held for `Gone With the Wind'</HEAD>

   Some disliked their roles, others were too young
to remember theirs, but 10 surviving cast members of ``Gone With
the Wind'' are excited about the hoopla surrounding the classic's
50th anniversary celebration.
   ``Thank God I had a part in it,'' said Ric Holt, who played Beau
Wilkes, son of Melanie and Ashley Wilkes.
   The Civil War saga's lone surviving star, Olivia De Havilland,
who played Melanie, was at Wednesday's reunion in spirit.
   De Havilland, who lives in Paris, sent her ``warmest
salutations'' to the reunion in a letter read by a tearful Rand
Brooks, who played Charles Hamilton.
   She signed the letter Melanie Hamilton Wilkes and asked Brooks
to remember her to the cast, especially ``the several Beau
Wilkeses, and my fond eternal greetings to the sole representative
of the Hamilton clan.''
   ``Anyone who had read the book sensed they were into something
that would belong to the ages, and everyone was in a frenzy to read
the book,'' said Ann Rutherford, who won the role of Scarlett
O'Hara's youngest sister, Carreen, because Judy Garland was filming
``The Wizard of Oz.''
   ``The specialness of this is with each generation of young
people who are touched by `Gone With the Wind,''' she said. ``As
long as there are little children, there will always be a Mickey
Mouse. ... On an adult version, `Gone With the Wind' does that.''
   The cast members were in town for the weeklong anniversary fete
of the movie's Dec. 15, 1939, world premiere in Atlanta. The
movie's ``re-premiere'' is scheduled for Friday.
   At the reunion were Butterfly McQueen, who portrayed the slave
Prissy; Patrick Curtis and Mickey Kuhn, who played Beau Wilkes at
various ages; Gregg Geiss, who played Bonnie Blue Butler,
Scarlett's and Rhett's daughter, as an infant; Evelyn Keyes, who
played Suellen O'Hara; Cammie King Conlon, who portrayed Bonnie
Blue as a child, and Fred Crane who as Brent Tarleton spoke the
movie's opening lines.
   McQueen, whose portrayal of the flighty maid who didn't ``know
nothing 'bout birthing babies'' won her acclaim, said she sometimes
hated her role because she thought it demeaning to blacks.
   ``To me it was just a job, but at times I hated the role,'' she
said.
   Ms. McQueen was typecast as a domestic in such films as ``Since
You Went Away'' and ``Mildred Pierce,'' but finally refused such
roles, saying they were an embarrassment.
   Brooks also said he despised his part as Scarlett's
mild-mannered husband.
   ``It was an asinine part,'' he said. ``I wanted to be more
macho.''
   Geiss, who won the part of the baby Bonnie Blue despite being a
boy because of his blue eyes, said he was 10 days old during the
filming, but still knew at an early age how significant the movie
was.
   Ms. Keyes, now an author and scriptwriter, said it is ironic
that although she has appeared in more than 40 films including
``The Jolson Story,'' she is ``unable to get away from `Gone With
the Wind.'''
   ``I wrote my second book about me, and my publisher wanted to
name it `Scarlett O'Hara's Younger Sister.' I said, `But it's not
about `Gone With the Wind,' and he said that's all I'm known for,''
she said, laughing.
   Ms. Rutherford concurred that no matter what else the cast has
done, ``Our obituary will say we were in `Gone With the Wind' and
we'll be proud of it.''
   Though long dead, ``Gone With the Wind'' stars Clark Gable and
Vivien Leigh (Rhett and Scarlett), producer David O. Selznick and
author Margaret Mitchell were remembered fondly by cast members.
   Ms. Conlon, calling Gable ``kind of a daddy,'' remembered that
Gable's ``mustache scratched when he kissed me. My mother's friends
swooned when they heard that!''
   Ms. Rutherford recalled that the night of the premiere, Ms.
Mitchell invited the cast to her Atlanta home for scrambled eggs.
Gable and Ms. Mitchell disappeared.
   ``Clark Gable and Margaret were hiding in the bathroom, Clark on
the edge of the tub and Margaret you know where, just talking,''
she chuckled. ``They had to get away from the photographers.''

<HEAD>White House to Seek Funding Increase for Head Start Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House agrees to propose a funding
increase of at least 3.5 percent next year for the pre-school Head
Start program for low-income children, according to a government
source.
   The final figure for President Bush's proposed 1991 budget is
still being worked out and could go higher, but the source said the
White House has agreed to seek at least $49 million more for the
$1.39 billion program.
   The Department of Health and Human Services had proposed such an
increase in Head Start funding for the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1, 1990. The Office of Management and Budget has agreed to propose
``a minimum increase of $49 million,'' said an HHS source who spoke
Wednesday on the condition of anonymity.
   Bush is to send his proposed 1991 spending plan to Congress on
Jan. 22.
   Congress approved $1.39 billion for Head Start for the current
fiscal year, $99 million less than the administration had sought.
   Head Start _ a nutrition, health screening and education program
that helps prepare low-income children for school _ is the only
major unresolved budget issue between the department and the White
House budget office, said sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Agreement has been reached to propose trimming growth in
Medicare spending by about $9 billion. Without any changes in
payment schedules, the program is projected to cost $130 billion in
the next fiscal year, but the administration will propose cutting
that to about $121 billion, sources said.
   Secretary Louis Sullivan fared well in negotiations with OMB on
the National Institutes of Health and spending for AIDS.
   The department had proposed raising the NIH budget to $7.2
billion next year, while OMB wanted to freeze spending at this
year's level, around $6.6 billion. The final figure will be ``over
$7 billion,'' the HHS source said.
   AIDS spending will be proposed at around $1.7 billion, the
source said. Sullivan had sought $1.76 billion. OMB initially
wanted to keep spending at the $1.6 billion Congress approved for
this year, which was slightly less than the administration had
sought.
   One recommendation that Sullivan lost was to require states to
expand Medicaid coverage to cover all pregnant women and infants
with incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty line. Governors have
called for the federal government to hold the line on Medicaid
expansions.
   The reductions in projected Medicare growth would be achieved by
trimming increases in payments to hospitals and physicians, but HHS
officials say benefits under the program would not be affected.
   Hospitals would take the largest hit, sources say. The
administration's proposal would chop more than $3.5 billion from
projected payment schedules for hospitals, including about $1.5
billion less for capital equipment reimbursements and $1 billion
less in payments to teaching hospitals, which receive more money
than other hospitals to compensate for their costs in training
physicians.
   Michael Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of
American Health Systems, which represents private hospitals, said
Congress is unlikely to accept such large cutbacks in hospital
payments.
   ``They went so far in these numbers that there's going to be a
pretty quick reaction against it,'' he said.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said she has gotten 27 Republican
senators to sign a letter telling Bush that ``any proposal to make
significant cuts in the Medicare hospital program is likely to face
serious opposition on Capitol Hill.''
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, ranking member on the House Ways and
Means Committee, is circulating a similar letter among
representatives.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Won't Seek to Re-try Case After Losing in Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent counsel says he will not seek
to re-try charges of illegal lobbying against former White House
aide Lyn C. Nofziger, now that the Supreme Court has refused to
reinstate his conviction.
   James C. McKay, the special prosecutor, said in a statement he
has decided ``not to proceed further with prosecution'' of
Nofziger, once a top aide to then-President Reagan.
   On Monday, the Supreme Court let stand without comment a U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that overturned the conviction.
   McKay said his decision was prompted by the lapse of time since
events involving Nofziger and by the appeals court's interpretation
of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.
   ``In these circumstances, McKay concluded that the substantial
expenditure of public funds that would be required to reconstitute
his office and prosecute Nofziger further would be unwarranted,''
the statement said.
   Nofziger, who served as White House political director from 1981
until early 1982, was convicted in 1988 of violating the Ethics in
Government Act.
   The legislation imposes a one-year ban on lobbying former
colleagues after a person leaves service in the federal
government's executive branch.
   Nofziger was sentenced to 90 days in jail and fined $30,000 for
lobbying top presidential aides within a year of his resignation on
behalf of three private clients, the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.,
a maritime workers union and the Fairchild Corp.
   But the appeals court, in a 2-1 decision, overturned the
conviction last June. The court said the indictment should have
been dismissed because it did not charge Nofziger with having
``knowingly'' lobbied on matters in which White House officials
possessed a direct and substantial interest.
   McKay said he was disappointed the Supreme Court did not review
the government's interpretation of the ethics act. He said he
believed the Justice Department had understood the statute
correctly, while the appeals court ``wrongly decided'' to overturn
the Nofziger conviction.

<HEAD>INS Levies Record Fine Against South Carolina Factory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South Carolina pillow factory accused of
hiring more than 100 illegal aliens, including a 12-year-old boy,
is being fined a record $580,000 by immigration officials.
   The 12-year-old was earning $4 to $5 an hour doing menial labor,
said Thomas P. Fischer, head of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service office in Atlanta.
   Working conditions for three Mexican boys, including the
12-year-old and two 15-year-olds, ``almost bordered on bondage when
you look at the age of these people,'' Fischer said. ``They were
being paid in cash; there was no documentation.''
   The boys were among 85 illegal aliens from Mexico and Peru found
working at the Piedmont Quilting Corp. in Walhalla, S.C., during a
July 17 raid, Fischer said.
   The administrative fine is the largest imposed by INS under a
1986 law that bars employers from hiring illegal aliens. It was
announced a day after the company, its owners and nine managers
were indicted on charges of illegally recruiting and harboring 117
illegal aliens.
   The criminal indictment, returned Tuesday in Greenville, S.C.,
was based on evidence that the company had employed 32 illegal
aliens in addition to those found during the raid, Fischer said.
   Plant owner Alfred Mizhir, 55, and his wife, Gail Mizhir, 30,
both of Spring Lake, N.J., face possible prison terms of 653 years
and fines totaling $5.1 million if convicted on all charges.
   The nine other indicted company managers or officers also each
face up to 653 years in prison if convicted.
   The criminal charges resulted from a six-month investigation,
which included the use of an undercover INS agent who posed as a
plant worker, Fischer said.
   Fischer said working conditions were unsafe for children who
``are not mature enough to understand the danger'' posed by large
machinery and 150-pound bales of fabric used to make pillows,
quilts and comforters.
   ``If something goes wrong, do you think that a 12-year-old is
going to complain or quit? He is going to shut his mouth,'' Fischer
said.
   The company refused to comment on the charges or the civil fine,
which it has 30 days to contest.
   ``There is no comment,'' said a woman who answered the telephone
at the factory. She refused to identify herself.
   The administrative fine also covers the company's failure to
comply with procedures to verify that more than 400 employees were
not illegal aliens, Fischer said.

<TEXT>
   A special prosecutor has been appointed to
investigate a report of a rape at the governor's mansion, and Gov.
George Mickelson said the investigation is causing agony for his
family.
   The special prosecutor, Craig Kennedy, said Wednesday he expects
the Pierre Police Department to complete its investigation into the
rape report within the next few days.
   ``We'll make a decision on what legal steps are appropriate
after we've received the results and completed the investigation,''
said Kennedy, who is the Yankton County state's attorney.
   Kennedy and other officials refused to discuss details of the
allegations.
   Police received a report on Nov. 30 alleging that there had been
a forcible rape at the mansion two days earlier. A statement on a
police log sheet said: ``Four boys at mansion raped her.''
   The Republican governor was in Washington at a U.S. Department
of Agriculture conference on Nov. 28. His wife, Linda, was in Texas
at the time.
   The Mickelsons' 17-year-old son, David, a senior at Riggs High
School, is the only other family member who is a permanent resident
of the mansion. The Mickelsons' two older children do not live in
Pierre.
   Asked whether David was traveling with either parent on Nov. 28,
Mickelson press secretary Gretchen Lord Anderson replied: ``We
don't feel that where David was is relevant.''
   Mickelson has not met with reporters since the rape was reported.
   In a statement Wednesday, the governor and Mrs. Mickelson said
they were pleased that the local prosecutor has said preliminary
indications are that no rape took place at the governor's residence.
   ``Our family is going through one of the most agonizing times we
have ever experienced. We have always held closely to the principle
that it is not how you fall that counts the most, but how you get
up and carry on,'' the Mickelsons said.
   ``We very much appreciate the compassion which so many people
have expressed to us during this difficult period, and we ask your
continued prayers and understanding,'' the statement said.
   Hughes County State's Attorney Mark Moreno said he appointed a
special prosecutor because he wanted to avoid the appearance of any
impropriety or conflict of interest.
   Moreno said one of his law partners, Mark Barnett, intends to
run for attorney general next year. He said another law partner has
represented the family of one of the people involved in the case.
   When Moreno acknowledged the investigation was being conducted
earlier this week, he said: ``From what Pierre police have told me,
preliminary indications are that there was not a rape at the
mansion.''
   Kennedy, who has six year's experience as a prosecutor, said he
hasn't seen any written report on the case but has talked
informally with investigating police officers.
   The special prosecutor said the fact that he's a Democrat and
the governor is a Republican won't affect his handling of the
investigation.
   ``I'm going to handle this case like I would any other, and
political affiliation has nothing to do with it,'' Kennedy said.

<TEXT>
   The race for president is getting
seamier as it gets closer, with the former girfriend of one
candidate accusing him of hating blacks and trying to bribe her
into having an abortion.
   The latest public opinion polls say the candidate, socialist
Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, has drawn nearly even with rightist
opponent Fernando Collor de Mello in the last days before Sunday's
election.
   An estimated 250,000 Brazilians gathered in Rio for a da Silva
rally on Wednesday, the biggest political turnout of the campaign.
   ``I will unmask Collor on national TV and show Brazil that he is
the greatest political lie this country has ever seen,'' da Silva
told the crowd, referring to a nationally televised debate to be
held tonight.
   Meanwhile, Collor de Mello concluded his campaign with a
rain-shortened rally in the southeastern city of Belo Horizonte. He
told about 12,000 people he would ``save the country from the
dictatorial candidate of the Workers Party.
   ``This leftist will not turn the green and yellow colors of our
flag red,'' Collor de Mello said.
   Candidate rhetoric isn't the only blunt talk in the campaign. On
Tuesday and Wednesday, Collor de Mello's organization had
commercials broadcast showing a former da Silva girlfriend.
   ``He ruined my life,'' Miriam Cordeiro says.
   Ms. Cordeiro said da Silva ``couldn't stand blacks.'' Most of
Brazil's 150 million people are black or mixed-race.
   She also accuses him of offering her money to have an abortion.
   The candidate says his daughter, Lurian, now 15, was born after
an affair with Ms. Cordeiro following the death of his first wife
in 1969.
   ``He offered me money to get an abortion,'' Ms. Cordeiro said in
the spot. ``When she was born, I put her in his lap and said `Now
go ahead and kill her, because when she was in my belly I wouldn't
let you.'''
   Da Silva, in his own TV spot Wednesday, was shown standing
beside Lurian. ``Lurian was the product of a gesture of love,'' he
said.
   After his affair with Ms. Cordeiro, da Silva married Marisa
Leticia, the widow of a slain taxi driver.
   Ms. Cordeiro says in the spot that her testimony was voluntary,
but a former campaign worker for Collor de Mello claims the woman
was paid about $23,000.
   The Brazilian press has roundly condemned Collor de Mello's
tactics.
   Da Silva's campaign coordinator, Vladimir Pomar, called the
interview ``a low blow.''
   Analysts say Collor de Mello, a 40-year-old advocate of a free
market, has assumed a right-wing posture of late and turned the
campaign into an ideological showdown in an attempt to depict da
Silva as the radical leader of a backward party.
   The tactic is seen as a response to polls showing da Silva
gaining ground.
   A poll taken this week by the respected DataFolha Institute
showed Collor de Mello with 46 percent, da Silva with 45 percent
and 6 percent undecided.
   DataFolha interviewed 5,250 voters. The margin of error was 3
percent.
   A poll released Wednesday by the Toledo and Associates
Institute, based on interviews this week with 4,073 people, said
44.7 percent supported Collor de Mello and 44.2 favored da Silva.
The margin of error was 2 percent.
   Just 10 days ago, Collor de Mello led by 15 points.
   Sunday's election is a runoff. The two candidates were the top
vote-getters in a 21-candidate field in the first round on Nov. 15.
   Analysts say da Silva's campaign took off last week after a
strong performance during a nationally televised debate with Collor
de Mello.
   Da Silva also gained votes by airing effective television ads
and by consolidating his support among other prominent left-wing
politicians.
   The election is Brazil's first popular balloting for president
since 1960, when Janio Quadros was elected. He resigned after seven
months in office, and three years later the armed forces took power
and ruled the country until 1985.
   Civilian President Jose Sarney was chosen by an electoral
college controlled by the generals.

<HEAD>Study: AIDS Victims' Blood Shows High Levels of Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS patients' blood contains hundreds of times
more virus than doctors once thought, and a single AIDS-tainted
syringe may carry enough to cause 700 infections, according to a
study published today.
   Until now, the amount of AIDS virus in victims' bodies seemed
strangely low, considering the ravages it inflicts. But new
measurements show those estimates were wrong, and the actual levels
are very high.
   In the typical AIDS patients' blood, the virus infects one in
400 of the broad class of white blood cells known as lymphocytes
and monocytes. Previously, scientists believed the virus had
penetrated just one in 100,000.
   ``The answers were quite surprising,'' said Dr. David D. Ho, who
directed the project. ``We found that the levels within the blood
cells were orders of magnitude higher.''
   The study also found that even when infected people seem well,
the virus produces new copies of itself that float freely outside
of cells in the blood plasma. This finding challenges the widely
held belief that the infection frequently lies dormant for years
after the initial infection.
   Ho's research at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles was
published in today's New England Journal of Medicine along with a
related paper by Dr. Robert W. Coombs and colleagues from the
University of Washington.
   Because the level of virus in infected people had seemed to be
so low, some researchers have questioned whether the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) really causes AIDS.
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. David Baltimore and Mark B.
Feinberg of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research said
the latest data ``should dispel any lingering doubts about whether
HIV is the true culprit in AIDS.''
   Ho said the amount of virus in victims' bodies may be high
enough to account for all the damage seen in acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   ``A few years ago, we were struggling with the apparent dilemma
that we have a lot of immune destruction and yet very little virus
to account for that destruction,'' said Ho. ``Therefore people in
the field are looking for indirect mechanisms by which the immune
system is damaged. Maybe if we have this much virus present we
could think more about the direct consequences of virus infection
as a major contributor toward immune deficiency.''
   Dr. William Haseltine of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute agreed
and said the research demonstrates the importance of virus-fighting
drugs.
   ``The most important implication is that antiviral drugs are in
fact the right approach,'' he said. ``There were people who
suspected that the primary disorder was caused by auto-immunity. It
very much looks now like it's a direct effect of the virus.''
   Ho's study calculated the number of infective doses in tainted
blood. One infective dose contains perhaps 1,000 or so individual
AIDS viruses and is enough to infect a tissue culture.
   His study found that one pint of blood from an AIDS patient
contains 1.8 million infective doses, while blood from someone who
carries the AIDS virus but is free of symptoms contains 15,000
infective doses.
   ``These values clearly show why the transfusion of contaminated
blood results in an extremely high rate of HIV-1 infection among
recipients,'' the report concluded.
   Blood banks routinely screen donations for signs of infection,
and transmission of AIDS through blood transfusions is rare.
However, the virus is still being spread by dirty syringes shared
among drug addicts. The researchers estimated that a contaminated
syringe could carry between one-half and 700 infective doses,
depending on the amount of tainted blood left behind and the stage
of the infection in the previous user.
   Health workers who accidentally prick themselves with needles
also risk infection. The researchers calculate that a needle
contaminated with the infected blood of someone who is free of AIDS
symptoms would carry six-hundredths of an infective dose, while a
needle from someone with AIDS symptoms could carry seven infective
doses.
   One infective dose can cause an AIDS infection in a test tube
under ideal laboratory conditions. While this also could be enough
to cause a human infection, Ho said that exposure to 10 or 15
infective doses may be necessary to reliably spread the virus.

<HEAD>Palestinians, Syrians Clash Near Sidon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's
Fatah faction mounted a pre-dawn raid against Syrian troops in
south Lebanon Thursday. Police said at least 10 combatants were
killed and 15 wounded.
   The raiders, estimated at 150, stormed and ransacked the
three-story headquarters of the Syrian garrison commander in the
two-hour foray that started from Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp
at 3 a.m., police said.
   The attackers used jeep-mounted recoilless guns, shoulder-fired
rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47 assault rifles in the attack,
according to police.
   ``It is the first assault they have ever staged against the
Syrian army across the Awali river,'' said a police spokesman, who
cannot be named under standing regulations.
   ``The Syrians are moving troops and armor to the area,
apparently to counter-attack. The situation is frightening,'' the
spokesman added.
   The river on the northern edge of Sidon, provincial capital of
south Lebanon, is 40 miles north of the Israeli border and nearly
25 miles south of Beirut.
   Israel, which invaded Lebanon in 1982 to drive out Arafat's
guerrillas from his main west Beirut redoubt, made it plain when it
withdrew from Sidon in 1983 that it would not tolerate any Syrian
military presence south of the Awali river.
   Arafat has been on loggerheads with Syrian President Hafez Assad
since his army backed Palestinian dissidents in 1983 who forced
Arafat to evacuate Lebanon's northern port of Tripoli, where he had
set up command after his expulsion from Beirut.
   Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas filtered
back in the last three years and Western military sources estimate
their strength in the Sidon region at about 5,000 hardcore fighters.
   The police spokesman said Fatah raiders punched three miles
north from their base in Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp to
attack the Syrian commander's headquarters on south Lebanon's
coastal highway.
   The fate of the commander, Col. Ziad, could not be determined,
but his top assistant, Maj. Ali, was among those killed, the
spokesman said.
   Also killed were three militiamen of the leftist Nasserite
organization, the Sunni Moslem group that has ruled Sidon since the
1975 outbreak of Lebanon's civil war. The three were manning a
checkpoint on the Awali bridge.

   The man whose complaint last July sparked the
ethics probe of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., has asked that the
outside counsel's investigation be widened and warned the committee
to be ``very skeptical'' about what the senator says.
   Mark Green, a Democrat who lost to D'Amato in 1986, filed a new
brief Wednesday with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. In an
effort to back up a charge that D'Amato makes false statements,
Green said D'Amato had denied asking the Department of Housing and
Urban Development to help certain projects, then backtracked after
the media obtained letters and memos to the contrary.
   D'Amato, at a New York news conference on another issue, said he
was unaware of Green's latest move, ``but it wouldn't surprise,
whatever it is, and I'm delighted that we'll have an opportunity to
have all of Mr. Green's charges reviewed by the ethics committee.''
   The senator said he was confident he would be exonerated.
   Green asked outside counsel Henry Schuelke III to expand his
probe to include phone calls D'Amato made allegedly on behalf of
mobsters and a HUD grant he helped procure for a group led by the
Rev. Al Sharpton.

<HEAD>FDA: Consumers Shouldn't Use Acidophilus Capsules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers should not use an over-the-counter
food supplement distributed by a Pennsylvania company because some
bottles contain capsules with potentially fatal levels of stannous
fluoride, the Food and Drug Administration says.
   Vitamin Specialities Co. of Wyncote, Pa., has asked its 22
retail stores in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania to recall
acidophilus capsules with lot number 069296 and has notified 140
mail-order customers, the FDA said in a statement.
   The product, which the label says will help restore and maintain
the mucous membrane that lines the stomach and intestines, is
manufactured by Vita-Pure.
   An FDA analysis found that some capsules had a 784-milligram
dose of stannous fluoride, which is used in toothpaste and is safe
in small amounts. However, a 784-milligram dose could cause
convulsions in an adult and could be lethal for a small child, the
agency said. Five capsules could kill an adult.

   Artists and arts institutions victimized by
the San Francisco earthquake and Hurricane Hugo have been awarded
$947,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts to repair damage
caused by the disasters.
   The largest grant was an emergency matching grant of $555,000
that went to the San Francisco Foundation for the Bay Area Arts
Recovery Fund, to be matched by $3 in private money for every
federal dollar.
   The arts endowment, an independent federal agency, also gave
$200,000 to Charleston, S.C., to rebuild hurricane-damaged arts
offices, studios, performance halls and rehearsal spaces and to
replace materials and equipment.
   An additional $100,000 went to the South Carolina Arts

   Americans paid close attention to news stories
about the San Francisco earthquake and the crumbling of the Berlin
Wall, but showed little interest in state and local elections,
according to a poll.
   Nearly three-quarters of the people surveyed said they
``followed closely'' the stories about the San Francisco tremor,
according to the Times Mirror News interest Index.
   The tumult surrounding the opening up of East Germany was
watched intently by half of those interviewed, the survey found.
   On the other hand, only 13 percent said they followed stories
about the resumption of hostilities in Nicaragua and state and
local election coverage.
   The index was based on a telephone survey of 1,230 adults taken
between Nov. 9-12. The margin of error was plus or minus 3

<HEAD>Murder Conviction Reversed After Nine Years on Death Row</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former janitor who spent nine years
on death row and came within six days of execution says an
appellate court decision to set aside his murder conviction has
made ``this Christmas as bright as can be.''
   In a 6-3 decision, the Texas Court of Appeals on Wednesday said
38-year-old Clarence Brandley did not get a fair trial when an
all-white jury convicted him of the 1980 strangulation and rape of
Cheryl Fergeson.
   The 16-year-old white girl was killed while attending a
volleyball tournament at Conroe High School, where Brandley, who is
black, was a janitor.
   Brandley's first trial ended with a hung jury. His attorneys
contended the conviction in the second trial was racially motivated.
   The appellate court called Miss Fergeson's slaying ``both
senseless and tragic.'' But it added, ``Our outrage over her murder
... cannot justify the subversion of justice that took place during
the investigation, which ultimately affected the trial of her
accused perpetrator.''
   Montgomery County District Attorney Peter Speers said he was
disappointed with the court's ruling.
   ``I felt the conviction should have been upheld,'' said Speers,
who planned a news conference today to discuss whether he will
pursue a third trial.
   Brandley heard of the court's decision on death row at the
Department of Corrections' Ellis Unit.
   ``This will make this Christmas as bright as can be. It was
worth the wait,'' Brandley said from the visiting area. ``It's been
a long time. I'm very thankful. I didn't know what it was going to,
when it was going to be.
   ``It's a prayer that's been answered. It's going to take some
time to sink in _ to soak in.''
   The appellate court said investigators failed to follow up leads
from witnesses and failed to take blood and hair samples from other
janitors who had been Brandley's chief accusers. The judges said
the investigators provided an opportunity for a common account of
the killing from the janitors, threatened witnesses and lost
evidence.
   Three white janitors testified during the first trial that they
had seen Brandley follow Miss Fergeson to a restroom. But when one
of the men recanted his testimony, he was not called to testify in
the second trial.
   Brandley's attorney, Mike DeGeurin, said he would ask the court
to set a $10,000 personal recognizance bond for his client and he
hoped Brandley would be home for Christmas.
   The appeals court refused Wednesday afternoon to set bond, but
DeGeurin said he had also filed a similar motion in district court
in Galveston.
   ``Thank you, Jesus!'' said Brandley's mother, Minnie Ola
Brandley, when told of the court's decision. ``Pray for us and
let's hope everything works out.''
   ``We feel better,'' said his brother, the Rev. Ozell Brandley.
``We have hope in the system that when it's all said and done,
Montgomery County will do the right thing because we all want this
country to be the greatest country on this Earth.''
   Brandley received a stay six days before his execution date in
March 1987. In granting the stay, a state judge recommended that
the Court of Criminal Appeals determine if an evidentiary hearing
was necessary, which it did.
   On Oct. 9, 1987, after the 10-day hearing, State District Judge
Perry Pickett recommended a new trial because the previous two had
been tainted with racism.
   ``It could have gone either way,'' Brandley said Wednesday.
``You always have some doubts. But when Judge Pickett got the case,
it gave me a whole lot more hope.''
   Brandley is the third Texas inmate in a year to have his
conviction overturned amid national attention.
   The capital murder conviction of Randall Dale Adams, whose case
was the subject of the movie ``The Thin Blue Line,'' was dropped.
He spent 12 years in prison. And a new trial was granted to Joyce
Ann Brown, a Dallas woman who spent years behind bars for a 1980
fur-store robbery.

<TEXT>
   When she left this small town 10 years
ago, Jennifer Casolo was a spunky and popular teen-ager who had
been a high school cheerleader. The social activism came later, but
her enthusiasm never waned.
   Wednesday night, friends placed a ``Welcome Home'' sign on the
town green and waited her to return home from Miami. Earlier
Wednesday, she was deported from El Salvador, where authorities
earlier dropped terrorism charges.
   The decision brought to a close an unlikely drama for Casolo,
28, who grew up in a working-class family and followed a spiritual
quest to El Salvador, wracked by a bloody civil war.
   In high school, Casolo was a popular student who finished at the
top of her class. In her senior year, honors came easily _ yearbook
editor, student body president, voted most ambitious, most
creative, and ``did the most for Thomaston High School.''
   ``She was the hit of the school,'' said Edward Wilkinson, now a
vice principal. ``She was very intelligent, inquisitive, a bundle
of energy. If anything needed to be started for school spirit or
something, she would always do it.''
   ``She's got a spirit that keeps her going,'' said Ann Lutterman,
who worked with Casolo in El Salvador in 1987 and 1988. ``She was a
cheerleader in high school, and it's that same kind of bubbly
spirit. Only for her it's directed toward the poor.''
   During that period, Casolo, who's barely 5 feet tall and weighs
less than 100 pounds, was known as ``Little Miss Hyperactivity,''
recalled Maureen Torrence.
   But Torrence and other friends say there was little sign then of
the spirituality Casolo would say she found working among El
Salvador's poor.
   In a letter sent to former clasmates last summer, Casolo
recalled ``how ashamed I was of being poor in high school'' and how
pained she was by the memory of demanding that her mother buy her
expensive blue jeans like those her friends wore.
   After her parents divorced, Casolo's mother supported the family
by working as a bookkeeper at a vocational high school in
Waterbury. Casolo has one younger brother.
   Friends say Casolo became more religious and more interested in
social work during her years at Brandeis University, a prestigious
liberal arts college in Waltham, Mass.
   At Brandeis, she took a double major in American Studies and
Latin American Studies, was captain of the soccer team, graduated
summa cum laude, and wrote a senior thesis on American popular
literature that her professor, Lawrence H. Fuchs, described as
``brilliant,'' and ``totally non-political.''
   Friends say Casolo experienced some anxiety about choosing a
career, torn between an attraction to social work and a feeling of
obligation to find a well-paying job to help her mother.
   Social work won out. After working with Salvadoran refugees in
Seattle, Casolo, fluent in Spanish, left for El Salvador in 1985.
Since then, she has worked for Christian Education Seminars, a
Texas-based ecumenical religous group that organizes visits for
Americans _ among them U.S. Congress members _ to El Salvador.
   ``I think that she was something she felt called to do rather
than simply take a job and make a lot of money,'' said Susan
Abbott, a close friend from high school.
   Casolo quickly formed a spiritual attachment to the country and
its people, particularly the poor. In one letter to a friend, she
spoke of joining the Catholic Church to become a nun. In another
letter, she wrote, ``I'm a pastor without religion. Only with lots
of love.''
   Her work in El Salvador ended abruptly late last month, when
armed government police stormed the rented, white stucco house
where she lived in San Salvador. From the walled garden in the back
yard, they dug up dynamite, mortar shells, and 22,000 rounds of
ammunition. Casolo and two Salvadoran guests were arrested and
jailed.
   According to Abbott, Casolo's strong feelings for the country
made it inevitable that she would form opinions about what was best
for El Salvador. But Abbott is certain that Casolo had nothing to
do with the arms.
   ``If you know Jennifer, you know how important Jennifer's work
was to her,'' Abbott said. ``And if she were seen as being
(supportive of the leftist rebels), the government would never talk
to her or allow her to bring delegations in.''

<HEAD>No Link Seen Between Aspirin Use and Heart Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who take aspirin during the early months of
pregnancy apparently do not increase the risk of having babies with
defective hearts, a study published today concludes.
   Women usually are advised to avoid aspirin during pregnancy
because it might contribute to excessive bleeding during
childbirth. Despite the warning, aspirin use is common during
pregnancy, especially during the first three months, when women may
not realize that they are pregnant.
   A recent study suggested another potential hazard of aspirin _
the possibility that it might increase the risk of malformations of
the heart in the developing fetus.
   However, the latest research, based on a review of 8,821
mothers, discounts this concern.
   ``The findings of this study indicate that aspirin use during
the first trimester of pregnancy does not increase the risk of
congenital heart defects in relation to that of other structural
malformations,'' the researchers wrote.
   The study was conducted by Dr. Martha M. Werler and colleagues
from the Slone Epidemiology Unit at Boston University School of
Medicine. It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   The researchers identified 1,855 women in Boston, Philadelphia,
southern Ontario and Iowa who had given birth to babies with heart
abnormalities. They were questioned about their aspirin use during
pregnancy. Their responses were compared to those of 6,966 women
who had babies with other forms of birth defects.
   No difference in aspirin use was found between the two groups.

<TEXT>
   Scientists said today they had confirmed a key
assumption used in forecasts of global warming from the greenhouse
effect, and that the effect is unexpectedly strong over warm ocean
water.
   The finding of this ``super greenhouse effect'' over the western
tropical Pacific Ocean is a cause for concern, said co-author
Veerhabdran Ramanathan.
   If it occurs because the water there has surpassed some
threshold temperature, the Earth's overall warming may accelerate
as more of its water warms beyond that temperature, said the
University of Chicago climatologist.
   But its cause is not known and its implications for the future
cannot yet be assessed, he said in a telephone interview.
   In the greenhouse effect, the atmosphere traps some energy
radiating from Earth rather than letting it all escape into space.
With buildup of certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon
dioxide, more energy is trapped, resulting in a global warming of
climate.
   Ramanathan said results of his study are consistent with
predictions that a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide will lead
to a warming of about 4 degrees Fahrenheit.
   He and graduate student Ameet Raval present the work in today's
issue of the British journal Nature.
   They measured the amount of trapped energy by comparing sea
surface temperatures to the amount of energy escaping into space,
as measured by satellites. The readings were taken during 1985 and
1986.
   They found that the higher the sea temperature, the more energy
was trapped in the atmosphere above.
   Analysis gave ``compelling evidence'' for existence of a natural
process that amplifies atmospheric warming caused by other factors,
the authors wrote. The effects of such a process are incorporated
in current computer models used to study the greenhouse effect.
   Essentially, the process is that as the sea surface and air get
warmer, the atmosphere accumulates more water vapor. The extra
vapor traps more energy radiating from the Earth, leading to
further atmospheric warming.
   The Nature paper is the first ``really decent'' demonstration of
this process, commented Robert Cess of the State University of New
York at Stony Brook, who wrote an accompanying editorial.

   A murder suspect who was in court this week on
a traffic matter is now being listed as the city's most wanted
fugitive and police are offering $10,000 for information leading to
his arrest.
   Police sought the public's help Wednesday in finding Shelton C.
Watkins, 17, who is wanted in connection with two homicides in the
District of Columbia. He has also been charged with murder and rape
in Prince George's County, Md.
   Watkins' bail bondsman and his parents said that if police
wanted him so badly, they should have walked half a block to the
D.C. Superior Courthouse, where he appeared in court all day
Tuesday.
   ``If you're looking for a person and he's wanted on charges, why
not do your homework?'' said his mother, Gwendolyn Battle.
   Police spokesman Lt. Reginald Smith said Watkins was not
arrested during his court appearances Tuesday because the warrants
for his arrest were issued late Tuesday, after his time in court.
   District police were still seeking Watkins late Wednesday.
   Ralph Weinstein, whose bonding company posted a $15,000 bond on
behalf of Watkins in October for an unrelated case, said Watkins
was in court Tuesday for a traffic matter and a juvenile matter.

<HEAD>Death Toll Reaches 130 in Gruesome Death Struggle Between Tamil Factions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATTICALOA, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful Tamil separatist group
drove a rival militia from this city in a fierce battle that killed
at least 130 people, many of whom were gunned down after
surrendering, witnesses said.
   In a three-pronged attack launched shortly before midnight
Tuesday, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam surrounded the
eastern coastal town of 60,000 people and clashed with the Tamil
National Army.
   The Tigers seized control of the town and drove out the National
Army members who had been based in Batticaloa. Witnesses and Sri
Lankan officials said most of the dead were National Army members.
   India sent peacekeeping troops to Sri Lanka two years ago to
help end an insurgency by Tamil separatists. The Sri Lankan
government claims Indian troops, who left the Batticaloa area last
month, created the Tamil National Army to fight the Tigers.
   India denies the allegations and Sri Lanka has outlawed the
National Army.
   At Batticaloa's General Hospital today, blood trickled out of a
drain from the mortuary and ran into a small concrete trench. A
group of somber women entered the building and screamed as they
recognized the bodies of loved ones.
   Military officials said 130 Tamils were killed.
   Nearly all the casualties were purportedly killed after
surrendering to the Tamil Tigers, relatives and hospital officials
said.
   ``Everyone was shot at very close range,'' said one man who said
he saw 42 bodies. He said all but four had their hands tied behind
their backs.
   According to an account pieced together from witnesses,
relatives and hospital employees, at least 50 members of the
National Army had surrendered to the Tigers, who then disarmed them
and bound their hands.
   ``What happened was they surrendered but one of them pulled a
gun and shot a Tiger. The Tigers just went wild,'' said one man who
asked not to be identified further.
   Outside the Batticaloa mortuary, weeping women who had just
identified the bodies of sons and husbands said they were still
glad the Tigers had ousted the Tamil National Army because now the
fighting would end.
   The women said their sons, many of them high school students,
had been forcibly recruited by the Tamil National Army. Other
residents and police gave the same story.
   Tamil Tigers say they want an independent nation because of
discrimination against the Tamil minority by the Sinhalese, who
account for about 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
control the government and military.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's population. Sinhalese
are mainly Buddhists and Tamils are mostly Hindus.
   At least 17,000 people have died in Sri Lanka in the past six
years in the Tamil separatist rebellion and a backlash by militant
Sinhalese upset with concessions made to the Tamils.
   The National Army is comprised of members of former rebel groups
that agreed to end their secessionist war and accepted an
India-mediated peace agreement with the government in July 1987.
   But the most powerful of the four rebel groups, the Tigers,
reneged on the agreement and began attacking Indian peacekeeping
soldiers sent in to enforce the accord.
   Hospital officials said about 50 bodies had been brought to the
hospital but they were arriving so fast the officials were unable
to keep the records exact. The small mortuary overflowed with
bodies and the smell of death wafted out of the door and into the
hot morning sun.
   ``The freezer has not been working for the last few years,''
said a nurse.
   Asked if this was the worst single killing in Batticaloa, he
shook his head and said ``there has been so many.''
   Residents said Sri Lankan troops stayed indoors during Tuesday's
and Wednesday's violence.
   In Colombo, a Sri Lankan military official confirmed the
fighting and said government troops did not get involved.
   ``We do not want to be accused of using our largely
Sinhalese-dominated armed forces to fight the Tamils,'' said the
official, speaking on condition anonymity.
   India withdrew its troops from Batticaloa under a phased pullout
program. India has agreed to withdraw the remaining 22,000 soldiers
from Sri Lanka by Dec. 31.
   In June, the Tigers agreed to cease attacks on government troops
after negotiations with President Ranasinghe Premadasa and other
senior officials.

   Opponents of a proposed radioactive waste
dump claimed a first-round victory after chasing members of a state
team scouting for sites through snowy fields and holding them
captive for four hours.
   Protesters were ready to be arrested Wednesday, but state police
agreed instead to file trespassing charges against members of a
field team from the state Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting
Commission.
   Protest organizers said they were ready to block inspection of
two other potential dump sites in Allegany County today if the
field team returned.
   Also Wednesday, 20 protesters were arrested on disorderly
conduct charges in Cortland County, 100 miles to the east, when
they refused to allow a state inspection team to leave one of two
potential sites there.
   Anti-dump activists in both counties have been camping out all
week at the five proposed dump sites, watching for the state
inspectors.
   Dump opponents fanned out along the edges of the Allegany sites
at dawn, armed with citizens band radios, portable heaters and
thermoses on sleds as they waited throughout the morning in
freezing weather.
   Bill Mura, who lives near one potential site, opened his home as
a rest area and warming station for protesters.
   ``We moved out here 22 years ago to get away from it all,'' Mura
said, gesturing toward the hilly, forested countryside. ``This is
what we get thrown at us.''
   His house, like almost every building in Allegany and Cortland
counties, bears a fluorescent orange sign reading ``No Dumping _
Don't Waste New York.''
   The five sites were chosen by the commission in September. Under
federal law, states must have a place to store low-level
radioactive waste by 1993.
   The commission plans to complete soil testing and other
preliminary evaluations by spring and then narrow the number of
sites to two or three for more comprehensive tests.
   Allegany protesters planned to block the state field team from
getting on the sites Wednesday, but the team was not spotted until
it was already on the site in the town of Allen at about 12:30 p.m.
   Several dozen people tracked the officials' footprints through
the fresh snow, chasing them up and down wooded hills until they
surrounded seven team members on a county road.
   About 100 protesters linked arms and formed a human chain to
prevent the officials from leaving the site.
   Allegany County Sheriff Lawrence Scholes, who has no deputies
other than jail officials, called in state police.
   The two officers who arrived made no arrests.
   ``At this point in time I don't see a need for arrests,'' Lt.
Charles McCole said. ``What I see is a group of concerned
citizens.''
   Dump opponents produced landowner William Giovanniello, who said
the state team had failed to give him notice that they would be on
his land and asked that its members be arrested for trespassing.
   ``They never notified me,'' Giovanniello said. ``No phone call,
no nothing.''
   Commission staff member Bruce Goodale called Giovanniello's
charge ``absolute, sheer nonsense.''
   Police and protesters began an hour of negotiations, with the
dump opponents demanding that the state team be arrested before
they would allow them to leave.
   The protesters eventually agreed to let the team members leave
after Giovanniello signed a complaint against them and police filed
charges with the district attorney's office.
   Exuberant protesters whooped and hollered ``See you in the
morning,'' as the team members were allowed to return to their cars.
   Jay Dunkleberger, executive director of the siting commission,
said he did not consider Wednesday's events a victory for the
protesters.
   ``I consider it a draw,'' he said. ``We did accomplish the task
we set for ourselves for the day.''

   The school board voted to fire the associate
superintendent of schools after learning he lacked an education
degree, and warned the superintendent he would lose his job unless
he is recertified.
   The board Wednesday reprimanded Superintendent J. Jerome Harris
for not disclosing information about Dr. Ronald Lewis, his top
aide, when Lewis was hired in 1987.
   The board voted to end Lewis' contract and said it would release
Harris as well unless he obtains the certificate he needs for his
job by the end of January.
   Harris, who allowed his temporary superintendent's certification
to lapse four months ago, said he needs one college course to earn
a new certificate, a course similar to one he taught for 14 years
at Brooklyn College.
   Lewis said he had been working to obtain an education
certificate since he arrived in Atlanta. He said he did not know
until Monday that he had been turned down.
   Lewis also has come under fire over allegations that he
plagiarized much of his doctoral dissertation in 1973.
   The allegations arose in 1982 when Lewis was nominated for a top
education job in New Jersey. He eventually withdrew his name from
consideration.
   Harris has said he knew of the plagiarism allegations when he
recommended Lewis but decided not to tell the board.

<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James Watkins' release
of long-classified plutonium production documents sends a message
to the public that the Energy Department's secretive years are
over, a spokesman said.
   Watkins released figures at the Hanford nuclear reservation from
1944 to 1960 on radioactive gas release and plutonium production,
long among the nation's most closely guarded secrets.
   An independent panel of scientists overseeing a study of
radiation releases at Hanford had requested the data, saying the
figures were essential in estimating radiation doses the public may
have received.
   Watkins announced the release of the figures in a letter to the
group Friday.
   ``It's never been done before,'' said Ken Morgan, a Hanford
spokesman. ``It's pretty dramatic.''
   He said the documents would be released in small batches as they
are requested by the panel of 18 independent scientists overseeing
the Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project. Copies will
be made available for public examination.
   John Till, the chairman of the scientists overseeing the study,
said the release of the information was fundamental to the
credibility of the study.
   The project and a separate study by the federal Centers for
Disease Control are the first steps in determining whether the
health of people living near the Hanford site may have been hurt by
radioactive releases in the 1940s and 1950s.
   The releases were revealed when a huge collection of documents
was declassified in 1986, and since then some area residents have
contended their health was damaged by the radioactivity.
   Watkins refused to declassify newer production data for Hanford,
citing national security concerns. Also still classified are all
production data from the Savannah River Plant, the South Carolina
plutonium production site.
   But Morgan said the period covered by the documents was a time
of heavy production, with eight reactors operating at Hanford.
   ``That's all I'm going to tell you,'' he said. To say more is
``telling people exactly how much plutonium we ever made,'' he said.
   An Energy Department source who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the decision to release the production figures was made by
Watkins over opposition from the Pentagon, which felt the figures
could be used to calculate the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
   Morgan said release of the data will not reveal how many nuclear
weapons the United States has.
   Hanford was created in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project
push to beat Nazi Germany to an atomic bomb. Eventually there were
nine plutonium reactors on the sprawling site. All are now closed.
   The documents to be declassified do not include any production
from the most recent Hanford reactor, the N Reactor, which has been
closed since 1987.
   Plutonium has a half life of 24,000 years, meaning that in
24,000 year half of a given amount is expected to decay. Because of
that, nearly all the plutonium produced in the nation is either
still in warheads or is stockpiled, said Jim Thomas of the Hanford
Education Action League, a watchdog group.

<HEAD>Report: Feds Knew Workers Were In Danger From Nevada Nuclear Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials knew that nuclear test site
workers were exposed to radiation in the 1950s and '60s but decided
not to reduce exposures because a change in procedure might have
disrupted testing, a newspaper reported today.
   Government records show that miners were ordered to retrieve
instruments from tunnels filled with radioactive dust and
contaminated debris soon after nuclear blasts at the Nevada Test
Site, The New York Times reported.
   According to the minutes of a Sept. 23, 1952, meeting of the
Atomic Energy Commission, predecessor of the Department of Energy,
``The commissioners expressed concern that workers might be exposed
to radiation hazards for too long a time.''
   Two weeks later, the commissioners were told that the program
for determining how much radiation hundreds of workers were exposed
to was not reliable, the Times said.
   By the following May, some commissioners were calling for
reduction of worker exposures by lowering the government's annual
safety limit, which was 12 rems, or radiation doses.
   Dr. John C. Bugher, the AEC's chief health officer at the time,
advised against lowering the limit, saying it ``would make it
impossible to conduct operations at the test site without major
changes.''
   Today the annual safety limit is 5 rems.
   The government documents were made available to the newspaper by
Las Vegas lawyers Alan R. Johns and Larry C. Johns, who allege in a
lawsuit against the government that radiation from bomb tests
caused the cancer deaths of 200 Nevada Test Site employees and
cancer illness in 18 others.
   In the 1950s, workers cleaned up rubble at detonation sites
without respirators to protect their lungs, the Times said.
   On Nov. 24, 1961, 108 miners were pulled from two tunnels after
they absorbed doses exceeding safety limits. The miners were
offered as much beer as they could drink for a week to flush the
contaminants from their bodies, the Times said.
   On June 6, 1963, 13 miners who had been clearing rubble from a
tunnel on the night shift were found to be contaminated by
radioactive iodine produced by a test in the tunnel the day before.
Miners on the next shift were ordered to continue work in the
tunnel despite the contamination, the Times said.

   McDonald's placed an advertisement for 630 crew
spots at the Soviet Union's first golden arches _ and was swamped
with job applications from 25,000 Muscovites, a company official
says.
   More than 1,000 applications flooded in the first day after the
ad appeared in a Moscow newspaper and hundreds are still trickling
in a month later, Rem Langan, director of McDonald's Moscow
operations, said Wednesday.
   Part-time Soviet workers at the new McDonald's will earn about
1{ rubles per hour, Langan said. That translates to about $2.50
according to the commercial rate, or about 25 cents according to a
new tourist rate.
   The first Moscow McDonald's is scheduled to open Jan. 31, and a
grand opening party will be held amid the splendor of the Kremlin's
Palace of Congresses, which seats thousands and is currently the
site of the Soviet Parliament.
   Langan said applicants in more than 3,000 interviews seemed
interested in making a career with the company, hoping to follow in
the footsteps of four Soviet employees who were taken to Canada and
the United States for training.
   The restaurant on Pushkin Square just off Gorky Street will be
the largest McDonald's in the world, seating 700 inside and 200
outside and serving 15,000 diners a day. The company plans to open
19 additional Soviet restaurants, and operates a farm, bakery and
meat plant near Moscow to ensure its supplies.

<HEAD>FDA to Increase Staff Involved in Food Labeling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration plans to
increase the number of its food inspectors by 10 percent to ensure
that food manufacturers adhere to regulations aimed at reducing
confusion over product labels.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young announced the move while several
dozen consumer groups expressed their concerns over current labels
during a hearing Wednesday, the fourth and final session held by
the FDA in a two-year effort to restructure the nation's food
labeling regulations.
   ``Food manufacturers are spending $3.6 billion advertising and
some of their claims are misleading,'' said Bonnie Guiton,
President Bush's adviser for consumer affairs.
   Officials have said labels containing words such as ``light''
mislead consumers because manufacturers use the word to describe
texture or color instead of calorie content.
   FDA spokesman James Carroll said the new regulations, expected
to take effect in mid-1991, call for manufacturers to use specific
definitions of such terms. He said the regulations are aimed at
ending ``chaos that exists in the market now.''
   Allen Goldberg, a spokesman for a group which represents 130
large food manufacturers, said most companies do not object to the
new labeling requirements, but do not want states to impose even
stricter regulations.
   The new labels would put less emphasis on vitamin and nutrient
content, and focus more on cholesterol, fat and sodium in the
product, officials said.
   The form of the new labeling remains undecided, but some
consumer groups suggested that officials aim for a simple, uniform
system of labeling.
   Charles Mitchell, an attorney for the Washington-based Center
for Science in the Public Interest, suggested a system of red,
green and yellow squares on packages be used to alert consumers to
the amount of cholesterol, fiber and salt in a product.
   ``Basically you're using traffic-light colors to signal
consumers,'' he said. ``Green for high fiber, red for high salt.''

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alan Garcia says a U.S. proposal to
give Peru more financial aid to offset its drop in drug income will
open a new era in cooperation between the two countries.
   The Bush administration plans to ask Congress next year to give
Peru, Bolivia and Colombia more money to counter economic losses
caused by their efforts to stem the drug trade that is the
lifeblood for many farmers.
   The proposal was outlined Wednesday in a document released by
Bernard Aronson, deputy secretary of state for Latin American
affairs.
   Aronson was in Lima to discuss with Garcia the agenda for a Feb.
15 drug summit involving Garcia, President Bush, and presidents
Virgilio Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia. The
summit is to be held in Cartagena, Colombia.
   Garcia hailed the proposal as a ``change in perspective'' by the
United States. He said it marks a ``new epoch'' in economic and
anti-drug collaboration between the countries.
   The document, a preliminary agenda for the summit, outlined
other themes to be discussed, including:
   _ Military and police aid to fight drug smugglers.
   _ Leftist guerrillas' ties to the narcotics trade.
   _ Crop eradication and substitution programs.
   _ Cooperation in extraditing drug suspects and stopping the
laundering of drug money.
   The document did not specify how much aid would be involved and
exactly what form it would take.
   ``The United States is open to considering support in the
balance of payments, such as subsidizing imports and contributing
to debt service with international financial institutions,'' the
document said.
   It also left open the possibility of financing alternative crop
programs through research assistance and credits to establish
markets for new products.
   Bolivia and Peru produce 90 percent of the world's coca leaf.
Most is transformed into paste and shipped to Colombia, where it is
refined into cocaine. The drug trade brings billions of dollars
into the three countries each year, and regional leaders have said
they need the aid to help them find substitute sources of income.
   Bush's earlier had proposed $2.2 billion during the next five
years for the three Andean nations, including $261 million the
first year, mostly in military and police aid.
   Garcia criticized that proposal, saying Bush was trying to turn
a social and economic problem into a military one. Garcia said it
was necessary to open markets and find ways to help peasant coca
growers earn a living from other crops.
   Peru, the source of 60 percent to 70 percent of the world's coca
leaf, was designated to receive only $73 million of the $261
million in the first year of the program, compared to $90 million
for Colombia and $98 million for Bolivia.
   The proposal included only $3 million in aid for Peru the first
year. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the amount for Peru was low
because of its unstable economy. The spokesman said officials were
worried economic assistance would not be spent efficiently.
   Inflation the last 12 months in Peru was 2,950 percent.
   However, an agreement was recently signed opening a new line of
credit with the International Monetary Fund and committing Peru to
make payments on its $1 billion debt with the fund. The fund cut
off credit in 1986 after Garcia declared a moratorium on interest
payments.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Gene Bigler said the rapprochement
indicated Peru's desire to stabilize its economy. He described it
as an essential step in opening the door to U.S. economic aid.

   Government-backed forces and rebels in Sri Lanka
have murdered more than 1,000 people each month since the
government reimposed a state of emergency in June, Amnesty
International said today.
   The human rights organization said security forces and
paramilitary groups trying to quell ethnic violence in southern
regions of the Indian Ocean island have killed hundreds of unarmed
rebel suspects at random.
   Minority Tamils seeking a separate homeland as well as the
ultra-nationalist Sinhalese People's Liberation Front group also
have slain hundreds of people, many of the governing United
National Party, the report said.
   Amnesty said the rebel groups' ``tactics of criminal violence''
were being adopted increasingly by the security forces and the
allied paramilitary groups. The government, dominated by the ethnic
majority Sinhalese, claims the paramilitary groups operate as
unauthorized vigilantes.
   Amnesty also blamed Indian peacekeeping forces for a ``rising
incidence'' of unlawful killings of unarmed rebel suspects in
northeast Sri Lanka.
   The report said pro-government forces and Tamil guerrillas have
mutilated, burned and dumped bodies of their victims in public
places ``to instill terror in others.''
   On the Indians, Amnesty cited witness reports that Indian troops
killed as many as 46 civilians in an Aug. 2 reprisal attack in
Valvettiturai hours after the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
ambushed and killed six Indian soldiers.
   The Indians arrived in 1987 to enforce a peace accord and,
failing to disarm the Liberation Tigers, began fighting them. India
has promised to withdraw its remaining 22,000 troops from Sri Lanka
by Dec. 31.
   Several lawyers pursuing the fate of people who have disappeared
after being detained in the south have been killed by unidentified
assailants, the report said. Three witnesses at an inquiry into a
young man's shooting by police also were reported killed in June.
   Amnesty said an emergency regulation allowing government troops
to dispose of bodies without having autopsies or inquiries
``encourages deliberate killings by the security forces.''
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa lifted a 5-year-old state of
emergency in January, but reimposed it June 20 amid widespread
killings and strikes.
   The government said there were 1,705 political-related killings
in the first six months of 1989, including 650 politicians and
political party supporters and 740 listed as ``civilians.''
   Amnesty said ``many more killings undoubtedly remain
unrecorded.''
   The number of killings rose markedly under renewed emergency
regulations, with ``well over 1,000 people being killed each
month'' through September, the group said.
   ``The right to life can never be suspended, even in times of
national emergency,'' Amnesty said. ``The violent activities of
armed opposition groups can never provide justification for grave
human rights violations such as extra judicial executions by
governments forces or their agents.''

<HEAD>U.S. Approves Revised Charter of New York City Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Justice Department approved of changes
in the city charter approved by voters last month that probably
will give minority voters more of a say in city government.
   Acting Assistant Attorney General James P. Turner of the
department's civil rights division said in a letter made public
Wednesday that the department ``interposes no objection'' to the
revised charter.
   Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., chairman of the Charter Revision
Commission that drew up the changes placed on the November ballot,
said one of the commission's major goals was ``increasing minority
representation in the city government.''
   ``The foundation has been laid for a more representative, fairer
and efficient city government,'' said Schwarz.
   The revised charter abolishes the city's Board of Estimate and
transfers its fiscal and planning powers to the mayor, the City
Council and other city officials. It also increases the size of the
council from 35 to 51 members.
   The charter revision is the most sweeping change in city
government since the consolidation of the five boroughs of New York
City in 1898.
   Most of the changes will be gradually introduced during the
first nine months of 1990.

<HEAD>Three Dead After Falling Into Molten Steel Pit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three workers plunged from a platform into
a pit full of molten steel and died and five other employees were
injured in the accident at the Johnstown Corp. steel plant.
   Four thousand pounds of molten steel poured into an open pit
after the lid blew off a caster at the foundry Wednesday at 5 p.m.
The five injured employees were standing around the pit, Cambria
County Coroner John Barron said.
   When the accident occurred, the company was testing the new
centrifugal caster at its No. 1 foundry, authorities said. They
described the caster as a turntable that has a cast placed on it.
   ``There was a large amount of pressure in the caster that blew
the top plates that the men were standing on, up and down into the
pit,'' Barron said.
   After the blast, workers sprayed the pit with fire extinquishers
to cool down the steel.
   ``The pit was glowing and a black dust was rising from it,''
said Bruce Horn, vice-president of operations, who was at the scene
at the time. ``Everybody was trying to run back from the pit and a
lot of the people were injured when they fell trying to get away.''
   Company officials suspended operations at the No. 1 foundry
today for investigations by Barron, the state police fire marshal,
the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and
Johnstown Corp.
   The men killed in the acciden were identified through dental
records as John D. Taylor, 39, of Johnstown, Joseph Olszewski Jr.,
43, of Portage, and James M. Dorofey, 35, of Conemaugh.
   Ian Sandler, 48, the company's vice president of research and
development, was among the five men hospitalized. He was in serious
condition undergoing treatment for smoke inhalation, a broken leg
and a broken ankle.

<TEXT>
   A young woman who fooled casinos
about her age and was set up as a high-rolling gambler while in her
teens was arrested for underage gambling two months shy of turning
21, authorities said.
   Debra Kim Cohen, who lost thousands of dollars in casinos at age
17, was arrested Wednesday while trying to play at a $5 blackjack
table at Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, said Steve Smoger, the
Atlantic City prosecutor.
   Smoger said Miss Cohen was ``the most infamous underage gambler
since casino gaming here'' and a ``master of disguise'' who could
fool people about her age.
   Five casinos were penalized in March for allowing her to play
while a minor. The state Casino Control Commission required the
casinos to pay $18,000 in fines and $162,000 in donations to
compulsive gambling programs.
   The commission said the casinos treated her as a high roller,
allowing her to lose thousands of dollars playing blackjack and
offering her free rooms, drinks, shows and meals.
   The underage gambling charge carries a maximum term of six
months in prison and a $1,000 fine, Smoger said.
   Miss Cohen's father, Atlantic City police detective Leonard
Cohen, had sent letters and photographs of his daughter to casinos
to get them to keep her from playing.
   ``Compulsive gamblers have compulsive problems,'' he said. ``The
industry has been denying that for four years.''

<TEXT>
   Sub-zero temperatures and snow lingered in the northern Plains
today as an arctic front barreled into the south-central states and
the middle and upper reaches of the Mississippi Valley were blasted
by bitterly cold air.
   Wind chill readings tumbled to as low as 40 degrees below zero
in Maine, while citrus growers worked to protect their trees from
an expected freeze in Florida.
   Squalls dumped snow on the Upper Great Lakes region today, with
up to 18 inches of snow forecast for the Door Peninsula in eastern
Wisconsin. A snow advisory was in effect for the Lake Superior
snowbelt and along the Wisconsin shore of Lake Michigan.
   Temperatures around Michigan at 4 a.m. EST today ranged from
minus 4 at Sault Ste. Marie to 20 above at Detroit. Snow was
falling over most of the state. Marquette, in Michigan's Upper
Peninsula, had about 14 inches of snow on the ground.
   Parts of Wyoming were under 14 inches of snow. An advisory for
snow and blowing snow was in effect this morning for northeastern
Wyoming and northern Colorado.
   Nebraska's winter wheat outlook worsened as the deep freeze
continued without a blanket of snow to insulate the crop from the
cold and wind erosion.
   Wind chills in Nebraska Wednesday ranged from 15 to 25 below
zero.
   Iowa's low temperatures today were expected to sink to 20 below.
   Most of northern Florida was placed under a freeze warning by
the National Weather Service. Lows from the mid to upper 20s were
expected in low-lying parts of Marion County.
   Citrus growers sprayed their trees with water Wednesday to
insulate them from freezing temperatures as cold weather pushed
southward.
   Wednesday's wind chills hit 35 degrees below zero in South
Dakota and Minnesota. Greenville, Maine, reported a wind chill of
40 degrees below zero.
   Arctic air slapped upstate New York and northern New England,
where temperatures were in the single digits or below zero today.
   Temperatures above 50 degrees were mostly confined to California
and the Southwestern deserts, the southern plains and lower
Mississippi Valley, Florida and Georgia.
   Wednesday's high temperature was 77 in Fort Lauderdale.

   Emerson College journalism students and faculty
prayed for the release of hostage Terry Anderson and sent
videotaped holiday greetings to him with ``I'm Dreaming of a White
Christmas'' playing in the background.
   ``Merry Christmas, Terry, and come home soon,'' a chorus of
students sang at the end of the videotape, which is being sent to a
Lebanese television station in hopes it will get on the air and
Anderson will hear about it.
   One of the students, Sean Armstrong, wrote a special song,
``Come Home Terry,'' that was sung during the Wednesday night
ceremony. The words brought tears to the eyes of Fifi Reed, wife of
hostage Frank Reed, who was a special guest.
   ``We'd like to see you safe at home
   ``Beneath the Christmas tree
   ``Your daughter is crying
   ``Daddy I want you next to me.''
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, has been held captive for nearly five years. During that
time his father and brother died of cancer, which he probably does
not know. He has not held his daughter, born three months after he
was seized on March 16, 1985.
   Anderson was kidnapped by Islamic Jihad, a group loyal to Iran
whose name means Islamic Holy War. His abductors demand the release
of 15 men imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies in 1983.
   The Emerson College chapter of the Society of Professional
Journalists and the student newspaper, the Berkeley Beacon,
recently started a ``Free Terry Anderson Committee.'' Students are
wearing yellow ribbons until Anderson is released.

<HEAD>Ex-Policeman Confesses To Death Squad Killing of Activist</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former policeman pleaded
guilty today to the murder of an anti-apartheid activist, saying he
was a member of a police assassination squad and had acted on
orders from superior officers.
   After years of suspicion among activists that police death
squads existed, this was the first time anyone confessed in court
to serving on such a unit.
   The black former policeman, Butana Nofomela, first made his
allegations in an affidavit Oct. 19, the night before he was to
hang for a separate murder with no political overtones.
   Armed with the affidavit, human rights lawyers obtained a stay
of execution for Nofomala so he could assist in investigations of
death squad activity.
   Subsequently, two other former policemen named by Nofomela as
death squad members confessed in newspaper interviews that they
were involved, and the issue has become a major national
controversy.
   Last week, President F.W. de Klerk rejected requests to appoint
a judicial inquiry commission, saying the allegations could be
handled through normal legal procedures. Justice Minister Kobie
Coetsee announced that Nofomela would be prosecuted for the 1981
stabbing of Griffiths Mxenge, a black lawyer and activist from
Durban.
   In a statement read in Magistrate's Court in Pietermaritzburg,
capital of Natal Province, Nofomela, 32, said he and three other
black policemen abducted Mxenge and took him to a stadium where
they kicked, punched and stabbed him until he died.
   ``At the time of the murder I was a member of the (police)
special branch assassination squad,'' Nofomela told the court. ``I
was instructed by Brig. (Willem) Schoon and Capt. (Dirk) Coetzee to
proceed to Durban and there to kill one Griffiths Mxenge.''
   Schoon, now retired from the police, has not issued any formal
statement on allegations he ordered Mxenge's assassination.
   Coetzee, who has fled South Africa, made detailed claims about
death squad activities, including Mxenge's murder, in a lengthy
interview last month with Vyre Weekblad (Free Weekly), an
anti-apartheid Afrikaans-language newspaper.
   Police have issued a warrant for Coetzee's arrest and have said
they will try to extradite him if necessary.
   After Nofomela read his statement in court, his case was
adjourned until Feb. 28.
   In addition to the alleged police death squads, police
investigators claim to have uncovered other assassination squads
run by far-right white extremists outside the ranks of the security
forces.
   Anti-apartheid activists and human rights lawyers have suggested
that disclosures about these extremist groups have been timed to
divert attention from the alleged police hit squads.

<HEAD>Rand Corp. Warns Employees Of AIDS Computer Scare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUINN LOTA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rand Corp. is warning employees about a
computer disk that is advertised as a database for AIDS
information, but which is believed actually to destroy stored
information.
   ``We're safe. We have not been hit,'' said Ann Shoben, a
spokeswoman for the Santa Monica-based research firm. ``The concern
is for others that use personal computers and those who work on
AIDS research might pick up this program and have their databases
destroyed.''
   Ms. Shoben said Wednesday that Rand employees were given a
memorandum after learning of the disk from computer expert John
McAfee.
   McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus Industry Association of
Santa Clara, Calif., said it is unusual for his group to issue such
a blanket warning against a particular disk.
   But because he has received calls from personal computer users
around the world, McAfee said, he believes the threat is real.
   ``This is not a hoax,'' he said. ``This is not a simple case of
a hacker in a back bedroom somewhere.
   ``It is a well orchestrated and undeniably well financed
terrorist act,'' he said. ``Few groups or individuals can afford to
waste hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring harm to a party and
bring nothing in return.''
   In London, Scotland Yard issued a warning Wednesday to banks,
hospitals, universities and other institutions to be on guard
against the disk. Scotland Yard said the disks have destroyed
information in at least 10 computers.
   McAfee said he believes the topic of AIDS was used by the
creator of the damaging program because many computer users are
likely curious about the deadly disease.
   People are encouraged to use the disk because it is advertised
as being able to predict the chances a person has of contracting
AIDS, he said.
   ``Unlike an accounting program, this is a subject everyone is
aware of, and virtually all people will want to learn more about
risks of having AIDS,'' McAfee said.
   Rand, which has 15 people working on acquired immune deficiency
syndrome research, took the message from McAfee seriously, Ms.
Shoben said.
   ``The people who are researching AIDS are very upset,'' she said.
   Ms. Shoben said her company was warned that a flyer accompanying
the unsolicited disk states the disk program is titled, ``AIDS
Information-An Introductory Diskette'' and adds that its price is
$378.
   The program also carries this ominous advice, Ms. Shoben said:
``Warning: Do not use these programs unless you are prepared to pay
for them.''
   McAfee said a company calling itself PC Cyborg Inc., with a
bogus Panamanian post office box number, has distributed the disks
unsolicited to major corporations and personal computer user groups
around the world.
   He said Chase Manhattan Bank was one of the first to report
problems with the software. The company's office in New York was
not available for comment late Wednesday.
   David Kanouse, who directs Rand's AIDS research group, said the
disk is for use with a personal computer and would not be an
immediate threat to a computer system like Rand's.
   ``It is unclear whether it is contagious,'' he said. ``It's
probably not contagious from machine to machine, but it would
destroy the system in which it is entered. It will destroy the
system it's installed in.''

   Earlier this week, convicted armed robber
Kay Smith planned a menu for Christmas dinner and mailed it to her
husband and two sons in Maryland, confident she would be released
from prison in time for the holiday.
   Her faith was rewarded Wednesday when a state panel granted her
parole, nearly 12 years after she escaped from prison, changed her
name and embarked on a new life that ended with her recapture in
1988.
   The state parole board voted 6-1 for parole after a 15-minute
hearing in which she pleaded: ``I just ask for forgiveness. I just
want you to know I have changed my way of thinking.''
   Mrs. Smith, 38, who earned a high school diploma, overcame drug
and alcohol abuse, remarried and began a successful career in real
estate during her decade at large, is to be released Friday from
the Women's Correctional Center in Columbia.
   ``I'm sure it's going to be hard to stay in a little cell''
knowing freedom is imminent, Mrs. Smith said at a news conference
after the board's vote.
   Asked what she would do in her final hours behind bars, Mrs.
Smith replied, ``I think that I can do a lot of reflecting back
over that time and just feel very thankful ... it's not much
longer.''
   The board rejected Mrs. Smith's request for a pardon in May.
   Under parole conditions set by the board, she will be under
supervision by Maryland authorities until March 1996. She also must
make restitution to a jewlery store that she robbed of $4,300 in
cash and jewelry in 1974.
   In January 1978, Mrs. Smith, then known as Pamela Rodgers,
walked away from a work-release center in Columbia while serving a
12-year sentence for armed robbery.
   She changed her name, married, and became a real estate agent.
But in May 1988, Maryland police acting on a tip from her
ex-husband, Daniel Rodgers, arrested Mrs. Smith at her new home in
Severn, Md.
   Her second husband, Ray Smith, and her sons, Daniel Rodgers, 19,
and James Rodgers, 18, had been unaware of her past life.
   After her recapture, South Carolina allowed Mrs. Smith to serve
her time at a prison in Jessup, Md., so she could be near her
family. She was brought to Columbia this week for the parole
hearing.
   Because of her conviction, Mrs. Smith may not be able to obtain
a business license in Maryland to resume her real estate career.
She said she plans to recruit and train real estate agents and try
to lead a normal life, without fear of the law.
   ``I hope to just be settled and have a routine day with a
routine job and a routine home life,'' she said.
   Mrs. Smith expressed remorse over her past, saying, ``I wish
that I could take it all back but I can't.''
   She also said she had matured as a result of her recapture and
incarceration.
   ``I've learned to work out my problems step by step and be
rational,'' Mrs Smith said. ``Most of all, I take responsibility
for my own direction and life. Pamela Rodgers was not quite there
at all.''
   E.W. Pace, owner of a Greenville jewelry store robbed by Mrs.
Smith, said he wants her to return the money stolen from his store
and then get on with her life.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, they can let her go and she can go
back (and) keep enjoying life,'' Pace said.
   A police officer in Greenville who worked on Mrs. Smith's case
and the solicitor who prosecuted her last year for the escape
charge both wrote letters to the board recommending her for parole.

   A fire broke out this morning on the third
floor of a five-story nursing home, killing four people and
injuring at least 10 others, officials said.
   The blaze started at 2:30 a.m. at the Shenandoah Homes
Retirement Community and smoke spread to the top floors before
firefighters arrived, County Fire Chief Tommy Fuqua said. It was
brought under control 2{ hours later.
   The fire's cause was being investigated.
   Officials said 124 residents of the home were evacuated to the
nearby Star City Skating Rink.
   William R. Reid, president of Community Hospital of Roanoke
Valley, said seven elderly residents were brought to the emergency
room about 4 a.m.
   ``One has a broken arm, two are suffering some cardiac problems
and the others have smoke inhalation,'' he said. ``We received two
bodies and we're expecting two more.''
   A firefighter and County Sheriff's deputy also were brought to
the hospital for observation, but appeared not to be seriously
injured, Reid said.
   Another patient injured in the fire was sent to Lewis-Gale
Hospital, Reid said, and others may have been sent to other
hospitals.
   Reid said an emergency room physician was dispatched to the
skating rink to check on the conditions of the evacuees, but all
reportedly were in good shape.
   ``We're in the process of getting breakfast to them right now,''
Reid said.
   Fuqua said there was no sprinkler system in the building, but
the home did have smoke deterctors and fire barriers.

   A centrist opposition candidate was the
favorite today as Chileans turned out in droves to elect a
president for the first time in nearly two decades of iron-fisted
rule by Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   Authorities reported calm throughout the country as polls opened
at 8 a.m. (6 a.m. EDT). Lines formed before dawn, and by 9 a.m.
they stretched for several blocks at many precincts.
   The nation's 20,023 polling stations were to remain open until 5
p.m.
   Voting was mandatory, and most of the 7.5 million registered
voters were expected to cast ballots in a resumption of a long
democratic tradition broken by 16 years of military rule.
   Voters were to pick a new president in a three-man race as well
as fill the 38 seats in the Senate and 120 in the House of
Deputies. The first official results were expected tonight, with
final results anticipated early Friday.
   Patricio Aylwin, 71, a leader of the centrist Christian
Democratic Party and the candidate for a 17-party opposition
coalition, voted at 8:30 a.m. in a crush of photographers and
television cameramen at a school near his Santiago home. He is
favored in most pre-election surveys to win the presidency.
   His main rival was Hernan Buchi, a 40-year-old independent
technocrat who served for nearly five years as finance minister
under Pinochet. Buchi, however, badly trails Aylwin in opinion
polls.
   The third candidate, millionaire, conservative businessman
Francisco Javier Errazuriz, was expected to finish last. Buchi's
advisers hoped to keep Aylwin's vote total below a majority and
force a runoff.
   Pinochet, who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, was obliged to
call the elections after losing a referendum last year in which
voters rejected a military proposal that he remain in power until
1997.
   The opposition coalition Aylwin heads led the effort that ousted
Pinochet from the presidency. The general says, however, that he
will remain army commander for eight more years, sheltered by a
constitutional provision that prohibits the new president from
dismissing him.
   Pinochet led the armed forces in the coup that toppled the
3-year-old elected government of President Salvador Allende, a
leftist, at a time of social, political and economic turmoil.
Pinochet said at the time the armed forces would remain in power
``only as long as as circumstances demand.''
   Interior Minister Carlos Caceres, in a news conference with
foreign reporters on the eve of the vote, said the military
government had ``kept their word'' to restore democracy once it
restablished order, straightened out the economy and created a new
legal framework for the country.
   Buchi on Wednesday said that regardless of who wins the
election, ``we should all celebrate Thursday as the day of the
victory of democracy.''
   Also Wednesday, the opposition angrily denounced a new law
barring future congressional probes into the Pinochet regime and
its officials. The law was passed Tuesday by the four-man military
junta that now acts as legislature.
   Enrique Silva, Aylwin's campaign manager, said the new law ``is,
in our judgment, manifestly unconstitutional.''
   The law is one of several being pushed by the Pinochet
administration in its final months in power, and seen by the
opposition as aimed at limiting the powers of the future government.
   Aylwin and his top aides have repeatedly said they will seek to
repeal or change those laws in the future congress.

   A black man playing Santa Claus at a
shopping mall says he was pressured to quit, but the mall's manager
says he'd like to have him return to work.
   Derrick Trice of Bladensburg, Md., said he would not return
until he gets an apology from the management of Capital Plaza Mall.
   Trice, 21, said he went to management on Tuesday to protest what
he called continual ``harassment'' by mall employees over the past
2{ weeks because he did not fit their image of Santa Claus.
   ``I love the kids, but I'm tired of being harassed (by
adults),'' he said. ``If I went back and sat in that chair with my
suit on, they would feel like they could call me `nigger' and I
would have to take it because I need the job.''
   Mall management released a statement Wednesday dissociating
itself from the complaints and saying Trice's return would be
welcome.
   ``The Capital Plaza Mall believes that it is appropriate to have
Santa Clauses of all races,'' the statement said. ``Unfortunately,
some customers at the mall, both black and white, have expressed
concerns with having a black Santa Claus.''
   Mall manager Tom Breece denied that Trice had been asked to
leave and said the man was ``upset, understandably, by customers
questioning his acting as Santa Claus because he is black.''
   Breece said he had not personally received any complaints and
did not know of any employees who had.

   Church activist Jennifer Casolo was back in the
United States today after being held 18 days in El Salvador on
charges of storing weapons in her garden for leftist rebels _ an
arrest her supporters suggested was a frame-up.
   Casolo, 28, of Thomaston, Conn., read the Bible and wept over
letters of support from friends after being deported and put aboard
a commercial flight Wednesday from San Salvador, friends said. She
also expressed concern about two Salvadoran friends who were
arrested with her Nov. 26.
   ``I don't think I've suffered as terribly as thousands of
Salvadorans have suffered here,'' she told reporters before leaving
El Salvador.
   She made no statement after arriving in Miami.
   ``It's just tremendous,'' her mother, Audrey, said from
Connecticut. ``We've already had our Christmas present here.''
   Casolo, who gave tours of El Salvador to visiting Americans as a
lay worker with Christian Education Seminars, was released after a
Salvadoran judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to hold her.
U.S. Ambassador William Walker escorted Casolo from the women's
prison outside San Salvador to the airport.
   Ms. Casolo's whereabouts were not immediately known this morning.
   A spokeswoman for Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said Ms.
Casolo decided to spend the night in Miami and return to
Connecticut today. But Roy Lloyd, a New York spokesman for the
National Council of Churches, which handles some business matters
for Chistian Education Seminars, said he had lost contact with her.
   Lloyd said she had been booked as a guest on morning news
programs today, but those appearances were canceled because she
couldn't be found Wednesday night.
   Lloyd speculated that exhaustion and concern that she might say
something that would harm co-workers still in El Salvador may have
been why she didn't appear. He added that she had been described
her as ``emotionally spent.''
   Martin Bailey, a communications representative of the National
Council of Churches who had met Ms. Casolo in Miamia, checked out
of his hotel room early today.
   ``It was a very emotional time for her, being taken straight
from the prison to the airport and deported, because of her love
for the people and the country of El Salvador,'' said the Rev.
Daniel Long, who traveled on the plane.
   ``She read the letters that she had on the way up today on the
plane, and she was very profoundly moved by the sentiment expressed
by people in churches and friends here,'' said Long, chairman of
the San Antonio-based Board of Christian Education Seminars.
   Casolo had lived in El Salvador since 1985. She and her friends
were arrested during a police raid on her rented house.
   Salvadoran police said they dug up 103 mortar shells, 213 blocks
of dynamite, 405 detonators, 150 feet of slow-burning fuse and
21,945 rounds of ammunition for Soviet-made automatic rifles in the
garden.
   Casolo was charged with terrorism, possessing weapons of war and
criminal association. She denied the charges.
   The timing of her arrest, during the biggest guerrilla offensive
of a decade-long war and the first to deeply penetrate the capital,
appeared to link it to a concerted government backlash including
raids, arrests and harassment against clergy and church members,
Casolo's supporters said. Six Jesuit priests were slain Nov. 16 and
a witness blamed government troops.
   The army and rightists politicians in the Central American
country accuse churches of aiding the guerrillas, while those of
the left claim the poor are forced into the guerrillas' arms
because the government quashes peaceful, church-sponsored calls for
change.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., an opponent of the Bush
administration's large military aid program for El Salvador,
predicted that persecution of other church workers would not end
with Casolo's release.
   ``One has to ask: If the government did not have the evidence to
bring her to trial, why did it see fit to deport her?'' he said.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani said there wasn't enough
evidence to continue holding Casolo. But he said he was ``morally
convinced that Miss Casolo is guilty.''
   Cristiani said the case against Casolo would proceed.
   ``If the evidence against her becomes sufficient, she will be
summoned to return for trial,'' he said, acknowledging that little
could be done to make her come back to El Salvador.
   In Connecticut, Dodd, who had spoken by telephone several times
with Cristiani in recent days, said the decision to free Casolo was
not the result of U.S. pressure.
   ``There were no deals. There are no conditions on aid,'' Dodd
said.
   ``I welcome this announcement for the signal it sends about the
legal system in El Salvador _ a system that has not exactly
distinguished itself for fairness or even humaneness in recent
years,'' Dodd said.
   ``She sounds very good,'' Mrs. Casolo said after speaking with
her daughter by telephone. ``But she was upset about the two people
she left behind.''
   Casolo's father, John Casolo, thanked volunteers and officials
``for bringing our daughter home.''
   Maureen Torrence, a friend from high school, predicted that
Casolo would try to return to El Salvador.
   ``Knowing Jennifer's desire and love for the people of El
Salvador, I would say she would love to go back. I don't know if
she can, certainly not under this current regime.
   ``But that's her calling and that's what she loves to do.''

   Marijuana is no more harmful than alcohol,
says national drug control policy director William J. Bennett, but
he still strongly opposes efforts to legalize it or any other drug.
   ``The last thing I would want to do is recommend the wider use
of a drug that makes young people stupid,'' Bennett said in an
interview Wednesday as he launched yet another counter-offensive
against the increasingly visible and voluble drug legalization
movement.
   While he said he does not think marijuana is more harmful than
alcohol, Bennett said, ``We have enough of a problem with liquor,
thank you.''
   Bennett, who has consistently denounced the legalization of any
drugs, spoke on the issue Monday at Harvard University where he
decried ``intellectuals'' who are ``on the editorial and op-ed
pages ... telling us with an ignorant sneer that our drug policy
won't work.''
   The next day, a federal judge for the first time joined the
ranks of drug legalization advocates.
   U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet _ a Republican and former
prosecutor appointed by President Carter as a trial judge in the
Southern District of New York _ said in a speech that drugs,
including cocaine and heroin, should be legalized, taxed and
dispensed by the state because the war on drugs is being lost.
   ``I suggest it is time to abolish the prohibition _ to cease
treating indulgence in mind-alteration as a crime,'' Sweet told the
Cosmopolitan Club in New York. The result, he said, ``would be the
elimination of the profit motive, the gangs, the drug dealers.
Obviously, the model is the repeal of Prohibition and the end of Al
Capone and Dutch Shultz.''
   Interviewed this morning on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, Sweet said,
``I have been surprised'' by the furor raised by his suggestion.
``This is a huge industry, $150 billion. It ought to be taxed,
regulated.''
   Terrence Burke, acting deputy director of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said on the same program that he was ``outraged''
by Sweet's proposal.
   ``The judge should get off that bench and get down to the
street, get out of the ... club and get down to Bellevue Hospital
and see some of those crack babies ... I really believe it's an
insult to people who are working in law enforcement in the
streets,'' Burke said.
   ``I know all about Bellevue, and I'm not about to go off the
bench,'' Sweet responded. ``... This is a very complicated problem
and it doesn't lend itself to ... comments about insults ... I
certainly believe in the agents who are doing their job as I hope I
am doing mine.''
   Bennett led a chorus of political and law enforcement officials
Wednesday rebutting Sweet's speech and the drug legalization
argument.
   The argument, Bennett said, ``is as stupid and morally atrocious
as it ever was. It doesn't make any sense...
   ``Judges aren't any more immune to ignorance than people in
other professions,'' he said. Being a judge ``doesn't mean you're
wise, it means somebody's made you a judge.''
   ``If he doesn't like his work, if he's tired of sentencing
people, he should find another line of work,'' Bennett said. ``It's
better to have clogged courts ... than crowded, jammed pediatric
wards of cocaine babies, which we will have a lot more of if we
take his proposal seriously.''
   In New York, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Sweet's speech
``shows a shocking lack of reality. ... This almost comes from
fairyland.
   ``If his policy were accepted he would be consigning millions of
more to lives of addictions,'' D'Amato said during a press
conference. ``He would be responsible for the deaths of millions of
more. ... It is a policy that is irresponsible.''
   Robert Stutman, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration's
New York office, said nearly three-quarters of the children who are
beaten to death in New York had drug-abusing parents.
   ``If you advocate a policy that says more parents are going to
use drugs you are therefore advocating a policy that says more kids
are going to be beaten to death,'' Stutman said. ``I think that
stinks.''
   Sterling Johnson Jr., the special New York state prosecutor for
narcotics, added, ``This is not the time to be advocating
legalization of drugs when we are trying to tell every young man
and child drugs are wrong for you.''
   The drug legalization movement recently was boosted by the
addition of President Reagan's Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
He argued during a speech at Stanford University that, ``It seems
to me we're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the
criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for
criminality out of it. ... We need at least to consider and examine
forms of controlled legalization of drugs.''
   The movement already included a broad cross-section of the
political spectrum. On the conservative side are economist Milton
Friedman and political commentator William F. Buckley. On the
liberal side are such people as Democratic Mayor Kurt Schmoke of
Baltimore, a former prosecutor; journalist and Carter
administration State Department spokesman Hodding Carter III, and
former Attorney General Ramsey Clark.

   The European Parliament today urged
Britain to stop repatriating Vietnamese refugees from Hong Kong and
blamed Britain for not generating international support to deal
with the influx of refugees.
   The Parliament also said the United States, which fought the
Vietnam War, has a ``special'' responsibility to help settle the
refugees.
   On Tuesday, the first 51 Vietnamese were flown to Hanoi. Britain
is determined to return 44,000 of the would-be immigrants from
Communist Vietnam, arguing they are economic migrants, not
political refugees.
   The European Parliament, comprising 518 members from all 12
European Community nations, said the distinction between
``political'' and ``economic'' refugees was ``arbitrary in the
context of Vietnam.''
   ``The collapse of the (Vietnamese) economy has resulted in large
measure from the imposition of a Stalinist economic model,'' it
said in a resolution that blamed the ``continuing refusal of both
the EC (European Community) and the United States to develop
economic relations with Vietnam.''
   There are 57,000 boat people in Hong Kong living in cramped
conditions.
   The Parliament said while it recognized the ``immense
difficulties'' faced by the government and people of Hong Kong in
coping with the influx of boat people, Britain must ``abandon the
policy of forcible repatriation.''
   It blamed London for failing ``to generate international support
to deal with this refugee problem in a humanitarian manner.''
   It asked the EC executive commission and the 12 EC states to
draw up an action program to resettle the boat people.

   About 8,000 Vietnamese today marched and
chanted slogans in a second day of peaceful protests against
involuntary repatriation.
   The European Parliament today condemned Tuesday's forced return
of 51 boat people from one of five detention centers in this
British colony.
   More than 2,000 Vietnamese men, women and children _ many
wearing white protest headbands _ marched through the Sham Shui Po
detention center in urban Kowloon today under banners that read
``Forced Repatriation is Homicide'' and ``Save our Souls.''
   They shouted slogans and thrust clenched fists defiantly in the
air as they snaked around the camp's playground. A few
plainclothesmen kept watch over the demonstration.
   At one point, protesters gathered in front of a makeshift altar
that had eggs piled on top and a sign that said: ``Requiem Ceremony
for 51 Souls.'' An official said the eggs were a religious offering
in remembrance of the repatriated Vietnamese.
   Nearly 4,000 Vietnamese protested at two separate centers on Hei
Ling Chau island, a former leper colony, and 2,000 more
demonstrated at Whitehead detention center in the New Territories
this morning, according to Francis Ma, spokesman for the
Correctional Services Department that runs the camps.
   Further demonstrations were staged in two of the camps in the
afternoon.
   ``They are peaceful and orderly demonstrations,'' Ma said.
   In Strasbourg, France, the European Parliament today urged
Britain to stop the forced repatriation, saying London had not done
enough to try to resettle the refugees. It also said the United
States should help solve the problem, given that fact that it
fought the Vietnam War.
   The Parliament, comprising 518 members from all 12 European
Community nations, said the distinction between ``political'' and
``economic'' refugees was ``arbitrary in the context of Vietnam.''
   The Hong Kong government issued a statement saying a Vietnamese
man who tried to commit suicide had been found hanging inside one
of the camps today. He was taken to a hospital where his condition
was listed as fair.
   There have been fears that forced repatriation could lead some
boat people to attempt suicide, but the statement said the incident
did not appear connected to the demonstrations.
   On Wednesday, about 6,000 Vietnamese protested at three centers,
with some shouting that they would rather die than return to
Vietnam.
   The protesters are among about 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed
into Hong Kong since June 1988 and are considered illegal
``economic migrants'' unless they can prove they fled their
Communist homeland out of fear of persecution.
   Nearly 6,800 have been denied refugee status after being
screened by immigration officials, compared with slightly more than
700 who qualified.
   The first batch to be sent home against their will were whisked
screaming and crying from their detention center by riot police and
put on a plane to Hanoi.
   British and Hong Kong officials say more repatriations are
coming and argue that returning the Vietnamese home is more humane
than keeping them indefinitely in the camps, which are overcrowded
and rife with violence and malnutrition.
   But among the signs at Sham Shui Po was one that said ``Thatcher
No Heart,'' a reference to British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who has strongly defended involuntary repatriation.
   Another sign read: ``Vietnamese Today! Hong Kong 1997?''
recalling concerns of some Hong Kong people who believe involuntary
repatriation will hurt the territory's chances of obtaining
international protection from Communist China, which takes control
of the colony in eight years.
   Hong Kong now houses about 56,000 Vietnamese. Those who arrived
before June 1988 automatically were granted refugee status and are
eligible for resettlement.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Everglades, Wetlands Bills</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts Bush's title in 2nd graf, The wetlands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North American wetlands will grow by nearly 2
million acres and the Everglades National Park in Florida will
expand by 110,000 acres under a pair of new laws intended to
reverse dwindling wildlife habitats.
   The wetlands bill will provide ``a steady source of funds for
the purchase of critical wetlands in the United States, Canada and
Mexico,'' President Bush said at a signing ceremony Wednesday. The
measure authorizes spending $15 million annually over a four-year
period.
   An additional $10 million would be generated for purchases each
year by putting excess receipts from excise taxes on hunting
equipment into interest-bearing accounts. Fines and forfeitures
collected under a migratory bird act, amounting to about $850,000 a
year, also would be used to purchase wetlands.
   ``This bill is an excellent first step in reaching our national
goal of no net loss of wetlands,'' Bush told a White House audience
of environmentalists and lawmakers.
   He said the steady decline in the duck population is largely due
to the continuing loss of wetland areas. He does not favor a ban on
development projects that destroy wetlands, but wants any
development offset with an equal amount of acreage restored as
wetlands.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who introduced
the bill last April, said it would allow the nation to begin
rebuilding waterfowl populations by conserving nearly 2 million
acres of U.S. wetlands under a 1986 agreement with Canada.
   ``There has been relatively little progress made ... during the
past three years,'' Mitchell said in a statement. ``It's important
that no more time be lost. Less than half the original 200 million
acres of wetlands in the 48 contiguous states remain, and the
destruction continues today at a rate of half a million acres per
year.''
   The expansion of the Everglades will be undertaken in
cooperation with the state of Florida, which will donate 35,000 new
acres to the federal park. The government estimates it will cost
$40 million to acquire the rest of the new acreage, with Florida
paying 20 percent of the costs.
   The Everglades, the second largest national park in the 48
contiguous states, is home to 13 endangered species, but problems
with the flow of waters have harmed the habitat for both birds and
alligators.
   ``The woodstork, heron, ibis, egret and roseate spoonbill have
all declined dramatically over the years,'' Bush said. ``The
Florida panther, the alligator and many species of fish are
declining.''

   Tyler Morey got a jury summons this

That's because his mother won't let the 11-month-old go out alone.
   The baby got his notice in the mail on Monday, his mother,
Heather Barnes, said today. She said she went to Superior Court and
``told them he wasn't going to make it. They sent me 10 different

   The error finally was straightened out.
   ``He's excused,'' a court spokeswoman said today. ``He's under

computer glitch.
   Barnes said she considered waiting until the summons date of
Feb. 5 and then showing up in court with the baby.
   ``But then I decided they'd probably be mad,'' she said.

   Medicare's controversial Catastrophic Coverage
Act, which sparked a senior citizens' tax revolt, is no more.
   President Bush signed the repeal Wednesday night of the year-old
program that elicited howls of protest from affluent retirees
facing income tax surcharges up to $800 apiece.
   Bush, who stayed on the sidelines all year as Congress debated
whether to modify the program or abandon it altogether, signed the
bill in private, offering no comment.
   The White House press office simply issued a one-paragraph
release noting that Bush had signed the repeal bill.
   The government expects repeal of the Catastrophic Coverage Act
to raise the federal deficit for fiscal 1990 by $4.8 billion, but
reduce the deficit by $15.8 billion over the next four years.
   Some advocates for the elderly have warned that the elderly are
likely to face steep price increases for so-called ``Medi-gap''
insurance policies now that Medicare has been shorn of the
catastrophic illness benefits.
   When President Reagan signed the act into law in July 1988, it
was billed as the biggest benefit expansion in Medicare's history.
Reagan called it a move that would remove one of the worries of old
age: going broke from illness.
   Instead, it triggered a flood of complaints from elderly
taxpayers appalled at the prospect of higher taxes.
   In enacting the catastrophic coverage, Reagan and Congress made
the beneficiaries foot the bill entirely by themselves. All 33
million Medicare beneficiaries were charged an extra $4 per month
in Medicare premiums, and the wealthiest 40 percent were to be
docked a 15 percent surcharge on their income taxes, up to $800.
   Many elderly griped they already had sufficient insurance from
their old jobs or private policies, and thus were being forced to
pay for something they didn't need.
   The law now repealed would have limited their expenses to $592
for the first day's stay in a hospital and to $1,370 in other
out-of-pocket medical expenses, starting in 1990. After that,
Medicare would have paid all charges it deemed reasonable. It also
would have provided some prescription drug benefits.
   The critics said the catastrophic act did little to address the
biggest cause of impoverishment from ill health: nursing home bills
that can run $25,000 a year or more.
   Bush had backed the Medicare expansion during the 1988 campaign
and denied that it involved a tax increase. He took no position
this year as lawmakers beat their retreat from the program.
   The Social Security Administration says it will take several
months to reprogram its computers, so the premiums will still be
taken out of Social Security checks into early next year, after
which people will get a lump sum refund for any payments made in
1990.
   The income tax surcharge, meanwhile, was repealed retroactive to
the start of 1989, when the program started. Because this year's
income tax forms were printed before the catastrophic law was
repealed, they include lines related to the surcharge.
   Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Aging, said he is asking the Internal Revenue Service
to expand its efforts to notify Medicare beneficiaries that they
need not pay the surcharge.
   The repeal legislation left standing some provisions that
expanded Medicaid coverage for pregnant women and infants up to age
1. States are now required to cover poor women and their babies
living at or below the poverty line.
   Also left intact was a requirement that state Medicaid programs
start paying Medicare premiums for the elderly poor or disabled.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new government said today it
has begun talks with Moscow on the pullout of 80,000 Soviet troops
from Czechoslovakia.
   Also today, the Communist Party denied it had reached a final
agreement with the opposition on choosing a president, saying a
final decision must be made at a party congress Dec. 20-21.
   But the party did not deny the substance of an agreement with
opposition leaders that will lead to the nation's first
non-Communist president in 41 years. The agreement was reported
Wednesday by opposition sources.
   In his first news conference since becoming foreign minister
Sunday, Jiri Dienstbier said he held ``preliminary talks'' with
Soviet representatives on the pullout of 80,000 Soviet troops.
   The discussions extended those begun by Dienstbier's
predecessor, Jaromir Johanes, in Moscow following the Malta summit
between Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush.
   ``I believe that we shall soon be able to arrive at some
concrete conclusions, some common understanding,'' Dienstbier said.
   The bilateral talks should run parallel with disarmament talks
in Vienna between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, which already have set
the goal of agreement on troop cuts in Europe by the end of next
year.
   He noted that the Moscow Protocol and the agreement allowing the
presence of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia ``have been rendered
invalid unter international law because these agreement were made
under pressure.''
   Alexander Dubcek, who led the reforms of the ``Prague Spring''
crushed by the Soviet invasion in 1968, signed the agreements after
he was ousted and flown to Moscow.
   The government and the opposition agreed Wednesday that
Parliament will choose Czechoslovakia's next president by the end
of January, with the stipulation that he be a Czech not affiliated
with any political party.
   No agreement was reached on who would be president, but the
accord sets the stage for the election of Vaclav Havel. The
playwright and former political prisoner has been the key figure in
the peaceful revolt that ended the Communists' monopoly on power.
   It also seemed to rule out any chance at the presidency for
Dubcek, a Slovak. A Czech is stipulated for the presidency to
balance the ethnic background of the new Communist premier, Marian
Calfa, also a Slovak.
   The presidency is largely ceremonial, but it has great symbolic
importance because of the respect the first president, Tomas
Garrigue Masaryk, enjoyed in the independent Czechoslovakia he
founded in 1918.
   A statement issued at the conclusion of the talks Wednesday
night also called for the ouster from Parliament of lawmakers ``who
do not provide guarantees of political democracy ...''
   The statement did not specify how the deputies would be replaced.
   A strong Communist majority runs the 350-member Parliament
which, under the constitution, had 14 days from the resignation of
President Gustav Husak on Sunday to choose a new president.
   It was agreed at Wednesday's talks to extend that deadline to 45
days, participants said.
   The opposition coalition Civic Forum had hoped to see Havel
voted into office during a two-day parliamentary session this week.
Last week, the coalition said there was virtual agreement with the
Communists that the president should be a Czech with no political
affiliation.
   But Communist deputies abruptly swerved in another direction,
proposing instead that the matter be put to a public referendum in
the hopes of buying more time to regroup and slow the quicksilver
reform process.
   Civic Forum objected to the referendum on the grounds it could
delay the more important task of moving swiftly to free elections
for an entirely new Parliament, expected by July.
   Political observers in Prague speculated that Communist deputies
in Parliament rebelled against the party leaders who conducted the
negotiations with the opposition last week.
   Opposition negotiators at Wednesday's talks, Petr Pithart and
Michal Kocab, and the leader of the small People's Party, Josef
Bartoncik, said it was decided at Wednesday's meeting not to scrap
Czechoslovakia's 70-year tradition of Parliament electing the
president.
   Communist negotiators did not comment as they left the talks.
   While the presidential negotiations were being held, the
government said Wednesday it was drafting laws to ensure freedom of
religion, assembly and association and provide more protection to
people who are arrested.
   The proposed legal reforms were announced to Parliament by
Deputy Premier Jan Carnogursky, a dissident lawyer released from
jail two weeks ago who on Sunday was named to the first government
in 41 years led by non-Communists.
   Changes in the penal code would strengthen the independence of
the judiciary and reduce the time a person can be held before
charges are filed, Carnogursky said.
   Carnogursky also has joined a three-man government commission
overseeing Czechoslovakia's secret police.
   His elevation and that of nine other dissidents who became part
of the 21-member Cabinet on Sunday has been the greatest of the
historic gains made by the reform movement, which since Nov. 17 has
used mass demonstrations to force the Communists to open borders,
promise free elections and surrender their monopoly on power.
   Husak, 76, resigned Wednesday from his last position of power in
the Communist Party, his seat on the party Central Committee, the
state news agency CTK reported.

<HEAD>School Bus Driver Suspended, Charged With Child Neglect</HEAD>

   A bus driver who got lost on her route dropped
off seven children at a closed school and told them, ``You're
gifted, you figure out what to do,'' authorities say.
   A man living nearby invited the children into his home to call
their parents, and the driver, Bobbette Collier, 35, was charged
Wednesday with seven counts of contributing to the neglect of
children, an offense carrying up to a year in jail and a $1,000
fine, police said.
   ``She's fortunate that the kids weren't injured or hurt by
somebody else out there after she dropped them off,'' said police
Officer Albert Augustine.
   Ms. Collier became frustrated on Monday when she got lost while
driving her route and returned to Edison Comprehensive Gifted
School. Authorities say she then drove away, leaving behind seven
pupils from kindergarten through eighth grade.
   ``We said, `There's nobody at the school. What are we supposed
to do? There's no where to go,''' said eighth-grader Amanda
Oshinski. ``And she said: `You're smart. You're gifted. You figure
out what to do.'''
   Bill Hood, president of Willett Bus Co., which employs Ms.
Collier, said the three-year employee was suspended without pay for
one month.
   ``What she did was a major infraction of company policies,''
Hood said. ``It was a serious incident. We are happy that it was
not worse than it was.''
   Ms. Collier was a substitute driver but had driven the route
before, Hood said. She blamed her becoming disoriented on the
children's misbehavior.
   ``They were running up and down the aisle, and they wouldn't
stay in their seats,'' Hood said. ``She was trying to get them in
their seats with their seatbelts buckled.''
   Hood said Ms. Collier told him she dropped the students off at
the school to see if they could get in. But he said the driver
couldn't find the students after they went around to the side of
the school to try to find an open door.
   ``The kids were just floating around out there,'' said Edward
Fraczek, the neighbor who offered the use of his phone. ``We
couldn't just leave them alone out there like that.''

<HEAD>Democratic Chairman Raps Bush on China, Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown today
criticized President Bush for his overtures to the Chinese
leadership that crushed student protests last spring, saying it is
part of a disgraceful U.S. policy.
   Brown, who recently returned from a visit to Berlin, also
attacked Bush for being timid and failing to make the United States
a force for democracy amid dramatic changes in Eastern Europe.
   Brown, addressing a breakfast meeting of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, called U.S. policy toward China disgraceful and said the
administration's high-level meeting last week in Beijing
``compounded that disgrace.''
   The meeting, he said, amounted to ``embracing that regime that
was crushing students with tanks just a few months ago.''
   ``I think that sends the wrong kind of signal ... around the
world,'' Brown said.
   Bush dispatched national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger to Beijing last
weekend for the first high-level meetings with China's leaders
since the crackdown in Tiananmen Square in June.
   Brown said that as communism recedes in Eastern Europe, the
United States should take a more active role in assisting those
countries in establishment of democratic institutions.
   ``We ought to be there to help,'' he said. ``We know more about
democracy than any country in the world.''
   Brown said Eastern Europe represents a large potential market
for U.S. business. A consequence of Bush's caution in Europe, he
said, may be that American businesses will get their too late,
after West German businesses win the new markets.
   ``They're reaching out to us,'' he said. ``I'm not sure we're
reaching out to them.''

<HEAD>Mercenary Negotiating Handover of Power, Some Comrades To Leave Soon</HEAD>

mercenaries likely to leave today, details. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORONI, Comoros Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European mercenaries who seized
control of this Indian Ocean nation in a coup last month are
planning to leave but their commander is still negotiating terms
for his departure, a South African diplomat said today.
   Thirty French and Belgian mercenaries, led by Bob Denard, have
been under pressure to leave the former French colony since the
Nov. 26 assassination of President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane.
   Denard, a veteran soldier of fortune in Africa and Asia, said
today he wanted a formal transfer of power to the French army
before leaving, said the Star newspaper of Johannesburg, South
Africa.
   Comorans, who are mainly African, believe the mercenaries who
run the 600-man Presidential Guard are responsible for killing the
president. Denard has acknowledged he was in the room at the
presidential palace when Abdallah was shot, but says he is not to
blame. He said a guard shot Abdallah ``by mistake.''
   France and South Africa, the two leading donors to the Comoros,
have suspended aid and are pressuring Denard to leave. Denard has
been negotiating with the French about his departure.
   Marco Boni, the South African trade representative on the
islands, said he expected some of the mercenaries to leave on an
Air France flight tonight, but Denard would not be among them.
   Boni said the talks were at an impasse, but he believed there
could be breakthroughs within days.
   The Star reported today that Denard and the last of his men
could leave by the weekend if there was agreement on details of the
departure.
   The newspaper's correspondent in Moroni said Denard's conditions
for leaving included:
   _ Indemnity against prosecution for any of the guards'
activities in the Comoros.
   _ Six months' salary, plus an undisclosed additional payment,
for all the ``good work'' he and his men had performed.
   _ That the press attend the formal transfer of power.
   Denard said he was prepared to return to France, where he faces
arrest in a suit brought by relatives of mercenaries killed in the
unsuccessful coup attempt Denard led in Benin in 1977.
   Several of the mercenaries have married Comoran women. Denard
has a Comoran wife and two children.
   Four French warships left Mayotte Wednesday for an unknown
destination. Officially the ships are preparing for a possible
evacuation of the 1,600 French citizens on the Comoros. France has
denied any intention to intervene militarily.

<HEAD>Networks Study Finds Button Fatigue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big three TV networks are asking the A.C.
Nielsen Co. to change the way it gathers ratings data, including
shortening the use of ``people meters'' to avoid ``button-pushing
fatigue'' among viewers.
   The recommendation was contained in a two-year study released
Wednesday and paid for by ABC, NBC and CBS.
   In a key recommendation, the study, which cost more than $1
million, calls for a reduction from two years to one the length of
time viewers involved in Nielsen's ``people-meter'' audience sample
are asked to participate.
   The 2-year-old system is in 4,000 homes. It requires each viewer
in participating households to press buttons on devices that either
are hand-held or atop the TV set. The devices indicate who in the
family is watching and which program is being seen. The data is
translated into ratings, which provide the demographic information
that advertisers seek.
   The study said viewers get tired of pushing buttons and that
such ``button-pushing fatigue'' sets in before the end of the
two-year period.
   The study, by Statistical Research Inc., also found a major
problem in getting households to join the people-meter sample. More
than half of those asked by Nielsen to participate declined.
   ``I would say unquestionably the cooperation rate ... is the
biggest challenge,'' David Poltrack, CBS senior vice president for
research.
   The report also urged a joint industry study of ways to measure
viewing by children under 6, and it urged that Nielsen appoint an
``ombudsman'' whose sole job would be to set and monitor research
standards.
   John Dimling, executive vice president of Nielsen Media
Research, praised the study as ``an outstanding effort'' and said,
``The key, I think, is that the system is good but can be
improved.''
   The report was prepared for the Committee on Nationwide
Television Audience Measurement, founded in 1963 by the three
networks and the National Association of Broadcasters to study TV
audience measurement.
   With the growth of cable and videocassettes, total network
shares of audience in prime time are in the lower 60 percent range,
down from nearly 90 per cent only 10 years ago.
   But the CONTAM study wasn't done to try to raise network ratings
and doesn't even mention them, Alan Wurtzel, ABC senior vice
president for research, said Wednesday.
   Its recommendations for improvemed audience measurement would
benefit the entire industry, including cable and advertisers, he
said.

   A woman who thought an inoperable brain tumor
would make this Christmas her last has been told she can leave her
hospital bed for home with a clean bill of health.
   Kym Curbow was scheduled for release this afternoon because the
holiday came ``a little early'' this year, as her mother put it on
Wednesday.
   ``We got ours on the afternoon of December Fourth,'' Linda
Curbow said.
   That was the day doctors determined that the mass next to her
20-year-old daughter's brain stem, where vital functions take
place, was a cyst _ not a tumor _ and removed it.
   ``When I walked in and said we have the final diagnosis,
everyone held their breath,'' said her neurosurgeon, Dr. George
Dohrmann. ``I said `Kym, Christmas has come early.'''
   A national ``brain tumor hot line'' made the difference for the
nursing student, who refused to settle for the bleak prognosis she
was given in August.
   ``A few months ago, I didn't think I'd have the rest of my
life,'' Curbow said as she prepared for her release from the
University of Chicago Medical Center. ``Now I know the whole thing
is over, that it's all gone.''
   Curbow, of Conyers, Ga., was referred to an Atlanta neurosurgeon
after complaining to her internist about severe headaches. The
neurosurgon performed a biopsy in August and ``just told her it was
inoperable,'' Mrs. Curbow said.
   The family was told Kym would likely lose her sight, her memory
would be affected, and that there was very little hope for a
positive outcome.
   ``Every report we got was worse than the one before,'' Mrs.
Curbow said. ``Kym was only 19 at the time and we weren't willing
to just sit and wait for this. It was a very stressful time.''
   Using her own medical skills, Kym tracked down the Brain Tumor
Information Service, a national hot line the University of Chicago
operates for people who need information on tumors.
   Doctors who volunteer for the service talk with those who call,
frequently send additional medical information to them, and often
ask to see medical records.
   After looking at Curbow's medical report and pathology slides
from her Atlanta neurosurgeon, ``we said two things,'' Dohrmann
recalled. ``We weren't convinced it was a tumor ... and second, we
thought there would be a way to remove it safely.''
   The cyst, which shouldn't return, likely began with irregular
cell development before Kym was born and may have been the cause of
the headaches, said Dohrmann.
   Dohrmann said Curbow's Atlanta doctor was not at fault, but that
``sometimes there are known treatments that can help people like
this and (doctors) just aren't aware of them.''
   The hot line's purpose, he added, is ``making national resources
available so that people don't have to depend just on what's
available locally.''
   And although not all calls have the happy ending Curbow's has,
Dohrmann said in nearly half the cases in which hot line doctors
ask to see medical records, ``something more .. can be done.''
   Kym Curbow said she is looking forward to returning to Georgia
Baptist Hospital School of Nursing and now has a new future in
mind: ``I want to be a neuro-nurse. I think I've had all the
experience necessary.''

<HEAD>Pardon Board Recommends Reduced Prison Term in Racial Death</HEAD>

   The Louisiana Pardon Board today
recommended early release for Gary Tyler, a black man who contends
an all-white jury wrongly convicted him of murdering a fellow
teen-ager during racial violence in 1974.
   Amnesty International and other organizations have urged freedom
for Tyler, 31, who has spent much of his life on the state prison
farm at Angola for a shooting that occurred when he was 16.
   Tyler's case has produced marches and rallies, and most recently
petitions to the Pardon Board with more than 12,000 signatures. The
British reggae band UB40 recorded a song about Tyler, and he was
described by the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda in 1978 as
a political prisoner.
   The Pardon Board voted 3-2 to recommend Gov. Buddy Roemer cut
Tyler's life sentence to 60 years. That would make Tyler eligible
for release in five years, once he has served a third of his
sentence.
   Roemer's spokesman said the governor was not available for
comment this morning.
   Tyler's mother, Juanita Tyler, said she was happy with the
decision,but believes Pardon Board members would have voted for an
immediate release had they interviewed him. Board members routinely
do not interview inmates unless they are facing death and Tyler's
death sentence was commuted in the 1970s.
   ``If they would have talked to Gary, I think things might have
been different. They don't know Gary,'' said Mrs. Tyler.
   Joseph Weber, the father of the 13-year-old Tyler was convicted
of killing, said he would try to influence Roemer not to commute
the sentence.
   In October 1974, Tyler was an outspoken backer of school
integration in Destrehan, a small town on the Mississippi River 25
miles north of New Orleans.
   State Police in riot gear were patrolling the streets amid
racial fights sparked by the presence of Ku Klux Klansmen led by
David Duke, now a Republican state representative.
   As whites surrounded buses of black students at Destrehan High
School, shouting and hurling bottles, cans and rocks, a shot was
fired from one of the buses. Timothy Weber, standing with his
mother across the schoolyard, fell dead.
   Witnesses said the pistol was held by a gloved hand. Tyler was
the only one on the bus wearing gloves, said police.
   Those who believe Tyler was framed say a student who testified
against him was known as a liar and that police planted a pistol
found in the stuffing of the torn seat where Tyler had sat.
   Tyler's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when
the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state's death penalty law.
But the conviction has withstood appeals.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney plans to move
ahead with building five B-2 stealth bombers next fiscal year but
has not decided on the fate of the full 132-plane, $70 billion
program in later years, Pentagon officials said today.
   Cheney's decision came as he was putting the final touches on
the defense budget for fiscal 1991, which is due to be submitted to
the White House in the coming days for final review before going to
Congress in January. The year begins Oct. 1, 1990.
   ``Five (planes) is right for '91, but there's been no decision
made on the out-years,'' said one source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Amid the reforms under way in the Soviet Union and the political
changes in Eastern Europe, congressional critics of the
radar-evading bomber have ridiculed the idea that the full number
of planes would ever be built.
   But Cheney has stressed throughout the budget process that he
prefers to cut entire weapons programs, rather than stretching them
out over longer production periods _ which makes each unit more
costly.
   The advanced technology bomber is designed to replace the Air
Force's aging B-52 strategic bomber fleet.
   The Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions that Cheney
had decided to build five bombers in 1991, 10 in 1992, 21 in 1993
and 24 in 1994. The rest would be completed by fiscal year 1996,
the newspaper said.
   Officials said later, however, that no such decision has been
made.
   ``Mr. Cheney has not reached any decision on his plans for any
programs in the out-years,'' said Defense Department spokesman Pete
Williams.
   Williams refused to discuss any of Cheney's plans for the 1991
budget, but he noted that the secretary has backed the long-range
bomber program as an essential part of the nation's strategic
defense.
   The Pentagon has invested about $23 billion in the program and
had expressed hopes of purchasing 132 bombers at a cost of about
$70 billion.
   But the price of the plane produced ``sticker shock'' in
Congress when lawmakers learned the price tag could be in the range
of $530 million for a single plane.
   Cheney's decision to move ahead with the program for a single
year comes as the Air Force recommended that the production be
stretched out over a longer period of time.
   Under the 1990 budget signed by Bush last month, the Congress
appropriated $4.5 billion for the program, and provided money to
build two in that fiscal year. Plans also called for funds for
components for five more of the radar-evading, bat-winged aircraft
in 1991.
   The Pentagon has proposed spending about $24 billion over a
three-year peak period for the bomber _ $7.8 billion in fiscal
1992, $8.4 billion in fiscal 1993 and $7.7 billion in fiscal 1994.
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice told reporters last week that he
was looking at plans to extended purchases of the planes beyond
previous deadlines to meet budgetary constraints and prevent cuts
to other Air Force programs.
   Air Force officials have begun studying conventional-weapons
roles for the B-2 as its original mission _ delivering nuclear
weapons to Soviet targets _ comes under question with warming
superpower relations.
   Bombers equipped with long-range missiles with conventional
warheads could be used to strike terrorist targets or support
limited Navy operations, the officials say.

<HEAD>College Presidents Asked to Attend NCAA Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College and university presidents must regain
control of their athletic departments, an American Council on
Education official said today in urging those with NCAA programs to
attend the sports organization's annual meeting.
   James Whalen, president of Ithaca College who is completing his
term as chairman of the ACE Board of Directors, said the NCAA will
meet Jan. 7-9 in Dallas to ``deal with issues vital to the future
of our institutions.''
   Whalen, in a letter to the presidents of about 840 NCAA
institutions, urged them to support a proposal requiring colleges
to disclose how many of their athletes graduate.
   Pointing to proposed legislation that would require such
disclosure, Whalen said if the NCAA does not adopt such a policy,
``the Congress of the United States will do it for us.''
   ``Federal intrusion in this area would set a very dangerous
precedent and would open a door that we will never be able to close
again,'' said Whalen.
   The highest number of presidents to ever turn up at the NCAA
meeting was 199, Whalen said, ``and 25 percent participation is
simply not enough.'' He said many presidents designate another
person, usually the athletic director, to attend the convention.
   Unless the presidents recognize the need to participate actively
in the NCAA, ``we're making a very serious mistake and our
credibility will be very, very poor,'' he said.
   The letter also asked for support of a proposal to shorten the
lengths of season for football and basketball.
   ``We genuinely believe that these are meaningful proposals, and
that they represent real steps toward reform,'' Whalen said in the
letter. ``They are not the final answer, of course; but they are a
good beginning, and they will be adopted only if we have the
support of our colleagues across the nation.''
   Whalen acknowledged that the presidents at many NCAA
institutions have little control over their athletics departments
and some have grown used to the extra revenue generated by the
various programs. But he insisted, ``the president must take
responsibility for all aspects of that institution, including
athletics.''
   Attending NCAA meetings has ``not been high on the agenda of
presidents for a number of years but this is a very important
responsibility that they have,'' he said.

   Nadia Comaneci plopped down nearly
$20,000 in traveler's checks on a Camaro convertible and shopped
her way through clothing stores this week, sales clerks said.
   Escorted by Constantin Panait, the married roofer who has
accompanied the Olympic gold-medal gymnast since she fled Romania,
Ms. Comaneci was staying in a $130-a-night suite at the Best
Western Beachcomber Resort and Villas here through Wednesday
morning.
   Thomas Martin, a salesman at Maroone Chevrolet here, said he
sold Ms. Comaneci the Camaro, a black convertible automatic with
gray bucket seats.
   She originally had her eye on a used Corvette, he said, but
Martin _ on his first day as a salesman _ steered her toward the
convertible.
   ``She fell in love with it,'' he said. ``In her country, all
they have is stick shifts.''
   Dealership manager Ken Pataki said Ms. Comaneci whipped out a
wad of travelers checks to close the deal.
   At a department store she got a 30 percent discount on a $184
``social dress,'' a knee-length white jersey decorated with pearls
and beads, said Phyllis Paul, a clerk at the store. She also
stopped at the cosmetic and shoe counters, she added.
   The stay at the hotel and some of the shopping spree and her bar
tab were apparently paid by British tabloids, which sent writers
and photographers to accompany Ms. Comaneci, hotel employees said.

<HEAD>First Person Charged Under Drug Tax Law Gets Fine, Probation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEWISTON, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former leader of a Just Say No chapter
drew 60 days in jail and a $1,000 fine for possessing cocaine and
not paying tax on it, becoming the first person prosecuted under an
Idaho law levying a tax on drugs.
   Victor H. Smith, 23, also was placed on three years' probation
Wednesday. He entered a conditional guilty plea to the charges
under which he retains the right to appeal the case and challenge
the law, which took effect July 1.
   Police said they found almost an ounce of cocaine in a car he
was driving in July.
   The drug-tax law imposes both civil and criminal penalties for
not affixing tax stamps to illegal drugs. At least 18 other states
have taxes of some kind on illegal drugs, according to the Council
of State Governments in Lexington, Ky.
   The state Tax Commission is prohibited from trying to establish
the identity of anyone who buys tax stamps.
   However, supporters say the law raises the cost of dealing in
drugs and gives prosecutors another charge to throw at a suspect
arrested on a drug offense.
   Smith was vice president of the local Just Say No anti-drug
organization until he was removed from that position in April.
   ``No one's perfect,'' defense attorney Charles Stroschein said.
``Lots of people ... have responsible positions and fall off the
bandwagon.''
   Judge Ron Schilling delayed execution of the sentences pending
Smith's appeal.
   The tax stamps are about 2 inches square and are green for
marijuana, blue for controlled substances sold by quantity and red
for those sold by dosage. They cost $3.50 per gram for marijuana
and $200 per gram for cocaine.

<HEAD>Democrats Blast White House for Blocking Testimony</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs with Fitzwater comment on VOA after 7th graf,
`We welcome'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House Democrats complain that the White House
is more prepared to dispatch high-level officials across the world
to reach out to the leaders of China than to send one official to
Capitol Hill to explain the action.
   Members of a House Foreign Affairs panel had sought the
testimony of Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger who,
over the weekend, accompanied national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft to China.
   When the White House blocked Eagleburger's appearance on
Wednesday, Democrats accused the administration of ``hiding out''
to avoid embarrassment.
   ``It seems the Bush administration is willing to send Mr.
Eagleburger 6,000 miles to apologize to the Chinese leaders but it
was not willing to send him two miles to Capitol Hill to explain
this action to Congress,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.
   The U.S. officials apologized, Gejdenson asserted, ``for being
offended by the savage squelching of those who courageously sought
basic freedoms in Tiananmen Square.''
   Meanwhile, the State Department announced Wednesday that China
has approved a new Voice of America correspondent to replace the
newsman expelled after the government crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   ``We welcome'' the decision to approve Stephanie Mann Nealer's
accreditation, the State Department said in a statement.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today, ``It's
difficult to assign a specific motive to why they did it, but we
think it's a good sign.''
   Asked if the administration considered it an important step,
Fitzwater said: ``Well, this is a world where signs and signals are
important, which is a lot of what all this is about as we
reconsider our diplomatic relationship.''
   Nealer is head of the VOA's East Asia and Pacific News
department. VOA correspondent Al Pessin and Associated Press
newsman John Pomfret were expelled from China after being accused
of spreading rumors and lies about the military crackdown.
   Gejdenson and other Democrats vowed to press early next year for
the imposition of punitive sanctions against the Chinese government
in retaliation for the killings of demonstrators.
   The Democrats also stepped up their verbal attack.
   ``By bowing and scraping to the butchers of Beijing, the
administration has sent China and the world a message that is not
worthy of the world's greatest democracy and one which does not
represent the views of the American people,'' Gejdenson said.
   ``This mission will not be recalled with honor but with a deep
sense of shame,'' said Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa.
   But Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, defending Bush, said the Democratic
criticism has become so shrill and partisan that it may well
backfire.
   ``I don't know of a soul who believes that the Scowcroft mission
went to Beijing to apologize to the Chinese,'' Leach said.
   ``This Congress and this administration have no intention of
kowtowing to illegitimate Chinese actions,'' Leach said, but added
that he believes the United States has an obligation to take
whatever steps it can to persuade the Chinese to lift the ``yoke of
political oppression.''
   Leach said the Scowcroft-Eagleburger mission can be seen as a
test of the administration's ability to ``help extricate a proud
nation from an embarrassing corner.''
   ``President Bush is prudentially betting that an historically
xenophobic China is more likely to temper its stridency at home and
abroad if it isn't perceived to be capitulating to the pressure of
foreign powers,'' Leach said.
   Two witnesses, Professor Merle Goldman of Boston University and
Minxin Pei, a Chinese graduate student at Harvard University, said
they believed the president made a serious error in sending the two
officials to Beijing.
   ``This visit is being trumpeted by the conservative hardliners
in China as a triumph of their reactionary policies ... and as a
seal of approval on their repressive regime,'' Pei said.
   But Doak Barnett, a veteran China scholar and professor emeritus
at Johns Hopkins University, said Bush made the right move because
``it is imperative to have a dialogue with the Chinese leaders at
the highest levels, especially at this time.''
   ``I believe Congress should allow several months to permit
President Bush's initiative to be tested,'' Barnett said, adding
that he believes there is reason for hope that the reform movement
in China will eventually be revived.

<TEXT>
   A little-known Moslem group today
threatened to kill Pope John Paul II because it said he has
supported Lebanon's rebellious Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun.
   The communique from the group, the Organization for the Defense
of the Oppressed, also told the Roman Catholic envoy living in this
country, Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente, to ``leave Lebanon soonest.''
   The statement was delivered to a Western news agency as the pope
was criticized by Lebanese leftists for failing to receive Arab
mediators seeking to end the 14-year-old civil war between Moslems
and Christians.
   ``The Organization for the Defense of the Oppressed, after
consultations with its forces fighting international arrogance,
announces that it has issued the death sentence on the pope of
Rome,'' said the handwritten, Arabic message. The 92-word statement
said the killing will be carried out ``sooner or later.'' It
charged that the pontiff ``has become the spiritual guide of the
mutinous crusaders in east Beirut,'' a reference to Aoun and his
supporters in the Christian enclave north of the capital who have
rejected a new Christian-Moslem government. Aoun wants guarantees
that Syrian forces will pull out.
   Last month, the pope said the Vatican ``cannot remain neutral''
and that ``it is time ... for sacrifices for the sake of peace.''
In what at the time appeared to be an appeal to Aoun to back down,
the message added: ``One should sometimes choose the less painful
options.''
   There was nothing to authenticate the Moslem group's statement,
which used Shiite Moslem fundamentalist language similar to that of
pro-Iranian extremist factions holding most of the 18 Western
hostages in Lebanon, including nine Americans. Those groups usually
send a phototograph of a hostage with their statements as
authentication.
   The Organization for the Defense of the Oppressed issued one
previous unauthenticated statement Aug. 28, threatening to kill the
pope if he visited Lebanon. The group has not claimed
responsibility for any terrorist acts, and its leaders, size and
overall goals are unknown.
   Aoun has rejected an Arab peace plan _ under which a new
Christian president, Elias Hrawi, was elected Nov. 24 _ because the
accord did not specify when Syria's 40,000 peacekeeping troops
would leave Lebanon.
   Hrawi fired Aoun from all his posts, but Aoun and 20,000 loyal
troops are holding out at the presidential palace in the Christian
enclave.
   Newspapers and radio stations controlled by the leftist and
Moslems in Beirut said the Saudi Arabian, Moroccan and Algerian
foreign ministers were in Rome on Wednesday during a tour of Arab
and Western countries aimed at bringing pressure on Aoun to stop
defying the Hrawi government.
   The Beirut media quoted Vatican officials as saying the pope was
unable to meet the delegation because he was preoccupied with
religious preparations for Christmas. Newspapers said the ministers
turned down a papal suggestion they meet his foreign secretary,
Cardinal Augustino Casarolli.
   There was no immediate comment available from the Vatican or the
Algerian and Moroccan embassies in Rome. An unidentified official
at the Saudi Embassy said his country's foreign minister was not in
the city.
   Newspaper and radio reports said the pope's attitude would
hamper the peace process and help cement Lebanon's de facto
partition into sectarian states.

<TEXT>
   An Italian Communist has begun a
fund-raising drive to buy a statue of Vladimir I. Lenin that was
removed from a public square after violent anti-Soviet
demonstrations.
   Roberto Napoleon wants to transfer the monument to Italy so that
the statue of Lenin can reside in ``a place worthy of a great
revolutionary,'' the state news agency PAP reported Thursday.
   The 30-foot-tall monument was quietly removed ``for conservation
works'' Sunday night from a square in Nowa Huta, an industrial
suburb of the southern city of Krakow.
   Demonstrators shouting ``Soviets go home!'' had tried to destroy
the statue during protests in the past two weeks and then clashed
with police, who used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the
crowds and protect the monument.
   Poland's Solidarity-led government, made up of former opposition
activists now required to maintain relations with the Soviet Union,
had said it would not tolerate more violence. Mediators called on
Krakow authorities to move quickly to remove the monument so order
could be maintained.
   Protesting the decision to take down the monument, Napoleone
called on ``all Italian citizens and Communists who believe in the
ideas of Marxism-Leninism'' to contribute to the fund-raising
drive, PAP said.
   ``Lenin was not Stalin,'' Napoleone told The Associated Press in
Rome, adding that he would stage a contest to choose a city to
receive the statue if his offer to buy it is accepted by Polish
authorities.
   In letters to the Nowa Huta muncipal council and Poland's
Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski, Napoleone said the money
paid for the Lenin statue could be used by Poland ``to make another
monument of bronze to the glory of the Polish pope ... or another
benefactor of yours,'' PAP said.
   Napoleone, a member of the Italian Communist Party who runs his
own publishing house, said he also gave a copy of the letter to
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, the first secretary of the Polish Communist
Party, who is visiting Italy.

<TEXT>
   A 1982 film about Stalin-era
interrogations has been shown in Poland, clearing the censor's
shelves of all those movies that were banned for their
anti-Communist messages, a noted director said.
   Ryszard Bugajski's film ``The Interrogation,'' completed in the
spring following the imposition of martial law on Dec. 13, 1981,
was previously distributed only illegally on videocassette tapes.
   But it was shown in a Warsaw cinema on Wednesday, the eighth
anniversary of the military crackdown to crush the independent
Solidarity movement.
   The lifting of artistic censorship has been a priority of the
new Solidarity-led government of Taduesz Mazowiecki, who became the
first non-communist prime minister in the East bloc in August.
   ``I hope that never again there will be such a power in Poland
which will decide for viewers what can and what must not be
watched,'' director Andrzej Wajda told the audience at the
screening Wednesday.
   ``Therefore, I can announce tomorrow as the beginning of the
`Cinema in Free Poland,''' said Wajda, whose works also were
censored. His remarks were carried by the PAP news agency.
   Bugajski's film concerns the 1950s arrest and torture of a young
singer who refuses to give the secret police testimony against her
friends.
   Bugajski emigrated to Canada in 1983 but was in Warsaw this week
for the Polish premiere of his film.

<HEAD>Company Running Smoothly Despite Pro-Democracy Involvement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's largest computer company has survived
despite the involvement of its former head in the pro-democracy
movement, but it has seen a decline in business because of the
government's current economic policies, its new president said
Thursday.
   Shen Guojun, president and chairman of the board of Stone Co.,
also said his ousted predecessor and former partner, Wan Runnan,
has no legal right to any assets in the company.
   Wan and two other senior officials of Stone fled China following
the military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, in which they
had been deeply involved.
   The government alleged the 43-year-old entrepreneur had donated
$54,000 to the student movement, although for some of that amount
Wan is believed to have acted only as a go-between for other
contributors to the students.
   Police are believed to have issued a warrant for his arrest as
an instigator of what is officially called a ``counterrevolutionary
rebellion.''
   Shen said at a news conference that Wan ``decided by himself to
take part in the turmoil against the will of the company'' and that
as a result he was fired from his posts.
   Shen insisted no employees had been punished for assisting Wan
in supporting the students. Wan's brother and father still work in
the financial section of the company, he said.
   He said the government froze company bank accounts until
September, ``for political reasons,'' apparently to keep Wan from
withdrawing money, but has not interfered with Stone's management
or independence.
   ``Stone is still getting a lot of favorable treatment from the
government,'' he said.
   But he said turnover and profits are down 20 percent this year
due to a government austerity program, which has left customers
short of funds, and the political turmoil of May and June.
   Stone, which commands 80 percent of China's word processor
market, had a turnover of $203 million in 1988, double the 1987
figure, and profits of $13.5 million.
   Shen said Stone also has had to adjust its product line as the
government, now moving to strengthen its socialist central planning
system, emphasizes heavy industry and other basic industries.
   Another company official said the company previously put too
much emphasis on electronics and office automation, and now has
shifted to marketing industrial control devices.
   Stone also has abandoned the idea of selling shares to the
public.
   ``We don't think it's a proper time right now to put Stone
shares on the market,'' said Hu Zhaoguang, president of the Beijing
Special Zone for high technology in the Haidian university area of
northwest Beijing.
   Stone was founded in 1984 by Wan, Shen and two other former
computer experts at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
   It quickly became China's foremost computer company and a symbol
of the entrepreneurial spirit encouraged by senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's market-oriented reforms.
   The independently run collective employs nearly 700 people and
accounts for 50 percent of the business in the Haidian district,
known as Beijing's ``Silicon Valley.''
   But in May, Wan is said to have joined student leaders in
calling for Deng and Premier Li Peng to step down. Members of a
Stone research institute collected signatures for a petition
calling for a meeting of China's legislature to discuss ending
martial law imposed by Li on May 20.
   Wan fled China soon after the June 3-4 military crackdown and is
based in Paris, where he is an active participant in the overseas
Chinese pro-democracy movement.
   Shen acknowledged Wan's role in the success of Stone: ``He did
his part and contributed to the development of this company.''

<TEXT>
   Palestinian guerrillas armed with guns and
grenades attacked a Syrian garrison in southern Lebanon before dawn
today. Police said at least 10 combatants were killed and 40
wounded.
   About 150 raiders ransacked the three-story headquarters in a
two-hour foray that started from Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee
camp, police said.
   Police and other sources said the attackers belonged to PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction, police and other
sources said.
   But the Palestine Liberation Organization, without explicitly
denying launching the attack, issued a statement at its Tunisia
headquarters condemning the raid by ``unidentified armed men,'' the
Kuwaiti News Agency said.
   Also today, a Moslem group threatened to kill Pope John Paul II,
claiming he supports the Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun. The
general has refused to surrender to a new Christian-Moslem
government trying to end the country's 14-year-old sectarian war
and has demanded that Syrian troops leave Lebanon.
   The Organization for the Defense of the Oppressed also said in a
communique that the Roman Catholic envoy in Lebanon, Papal Nuncio
Pablo Puente, must ``leave Lebanon soonest.'' There was no way of
authenticating the message.
   The little-known group, which has never claimed responsibility
for a terrorist attack, in August threatened to kill the pope if he
visited Lebanon.
   The attackers in Sidon used jeep-mounted 107mm recoilless guns,
shoulder-fired rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47 assault rifles,
police said.
   ``Some of the dozen or so Syrian guards who were caught by
surprise fought hand-to-hand to stop the attack, but they were
hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned,'' a police spokesman said.
   He said it was the first attack the Palestinians had ever staged
against the Syrian army, whose southernmost garrisons in Lebanon
are across the Awali river, which is on the northern edge of Sidon
40 miles north of the Israeli border and nearly 25 miles south of
Beirut.
   ``The Syrians are moving troops and armor to the area,
apparently to counterattack. The situation is frightening,'' said
the police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations.
   He was evidently alluding to fears the Syrians might cross the
river to take revenge on Fatah, even at the risk of sparking a
confrontation with Israel.
   Police could not give a complete breakdown of the 10 killed.
They said they included at least two attackers. Also killed were
three militiamen of the leftist Nasserite Organization, the Sunni
Moslem group that has ruled Sidon since the 1975 outbreak of
Lebanon's civil war, who were manning a checkpoint on a nearby
bridge.
   Sidon, Lebanon's third largest city with a population of
350,000, closed down in daylong general strike called by the
Nasserites to protest the attack, which they blamed ``exclusively
on Fatah.''
   Arafat has been at loggerheads with President Hafez Assad of
Syria since Assad's army backed Palestinian dissidents in 1983 who
forced Arafat to evacuate Lebanon's northern port of Tripoli.
Arafat had set up command there after his expulsion from Beirut.
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to drive out Arafat's guerrillas
from his main west Beirut redoubt and made it plain when it
withdrew in 1983 that it would not tolerate any Syrian military
presence south of the Awali.
   The Syrians had withdrawn most of their 100-man garrison from
the two-mile coastal strip just across the Awali three weeks ago
when they massed on mountaintops in central Lebanon to put pressure
on Aoun.
   Fatah guerrillas filtered back into Lebanon the last three years
and Western military sources estimate their strength in the Sidon
region at about 5,000 hard-core fighters.
   The Syrians maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League mandate to smother Lebanon's Moslem-Christian civil war.

   Masked bandits ramed an armored van, shot
its driver and then fled with more than $3.1 million in cash,
police said.
   Police said the bandits knocked the armored vehicle into a wall
with their own van, encircled it with three other cars to block its
escape routes and then rushed it under a hail of gunfire that
seriously wounded the driver. Two guards inside the van were not
injured.
   Police found more than 20 spent rounds at the scene, indicating
the bandits might have fired an automatic rifle, the Italian news
agency ANSA reported.
   Witnesses said there were at least six bandits in the cars and
van and another two on motor scooters.
   Police said the bandits took three bags of cash the armored van
was delivering to post offices and a branch of the Bank of Italy.
   The thieves abandoned some of the cars at the scene and others
at a two service areas on the toll road north of Florence, police
said.

   NATO leaders today disclosed that arrangements
are being made for an unprecedented visit by Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to the organization's headquarters.
   The move was announced after the 16 foreign ministers meeting
here set aside a squabble over a Turkish port and approved the
draft of a treaty to reduce Western and Warsaw Pact forces in
Europe.
   A NATO spokesman said Shevardnadze had requested a meeting in
Brussels on Monday or Tuesday with Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner.
   ``We are now trying to arrange for Mr. Shevardnadze to have a
meeting...,'' said the spokesman, Robin Stafford.
   It would be the first visit to NATO headquarters by a Soviet
foreign minister. The purpose and agenda of the meeting were not
immediately known. He had already planned a trip to Brussels to
sign a trade agreement with the European Community.
   The initiative originated at a dinner meeting Wednesday night
between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and the foreign
ministers of Britain, France and West Germany, sources said.
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact are moving to complete a treaty to
reduce their non-nuclear forces in Europe. The two military
alliances appear to be moving into a new stage as East and West
draw closer together.
   Among the key provisions of the draft are setting a ceiling of
275,000 for U.S. and Soviet troops on foreign soil and sharp
cutbacks in tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear weapons.
   In Vienna, where the negotiators are meeting, NATO presented the
proposal. Polish Ambassador Wlodzimierz Konarski, speaking on
behalf of the seven-nation Warsaw Pact, said his alliance is eager
to examine Western proposals.
   Earlier, the Warsaw Pact presented proposals that would reduce
six categories of weaponry and have an agreement ready for signing
by next year.
   Greece had demanded the NATO draft explicitly cite the Turkish
port of Mersin as subject to the reductions that are to take place
across the vast expanse of Europe. The port was used by Turkey in
its 1974 invasion of Cyprus.
   After several hours of deliberatiion, the ministers decided to
set the dispute aside, but also to give Greece an opportunity to
make its case outside the text, possibly in a footnote.
   ``It was agreed,'' Hurd said, ``that the text should be tabled
by everybody; i.e. the consensus was maintained.''
   He said Woerner was told to note that ``there were certain
matters covered by several articles which required further
elaboration.''
   A NATO official, demanding anonymity, said of the dispute: ``It
was left open. It won't be an obstacle to presenting the text.''
   The ministers wanted to move quickly because the Warsaw Pact was
expected to present its version of the treaty by the end of the
week. The current round of negotiations will be recessed Dec. 21
for year-end holidays.
   At the start of the NATO meeting, Woerner, the alliance's top
official, urged the Western military alliance to maintain a strong
defense to ensure the spectacular changes unfolding in the East
remain peaceful.
   Since August, Poland has elected the first non-Communist-led
government in the Soviet bloc, Hungary has ousted its hard-line
Communist leaders and disbanded the party, East Germany has lifted
travel restrictions, opened the Berlin Wall, replaced its hard-line
leaders and scheduled free elections, and a government dominated by
non-Communists has taken control of Czechoslovakia.
   Woerner said a solid security base was needed so that ``no
government will ever be tempted to resort to force to solve its
domestic problems.''
   The two-day meeting of NATO foreign ministers is focused on a
U.S. prescription for ``an architecture for a new Europe'' that
would gradually extend NATO's mission to the political arena.
   Woerner, a former West German defense minister, said the 16
Western governments must make arrangements for transition from a
post-World War II order ``to a Europe whole and free and to a state
of peace in Europe in which the German people regains its unity
through free self-determination.''
   Baker, who outlined the U.S. plan in a speech Tuesday in West
Berlin, envisions the alliance as a permament monitor of troop
reductions now being negotiated with the Warsaw Pact and as a
mediator in regional disputes.
   Woerner told the ministers that the alliance must remain in
place ``to provide security and stability throughout the long
period of transition that we are now entering: Change needs
stability.''
   ``The developments we have seen thus far have been impressively
peaceful,'' he said. ``But the pressures which might be released by
long-overdue change could prove explosive.''
   Norway's foreign minister, Kjell Magne Bondevik, cautioned that
``periods of rapid change carry with them the inherent danger of
instability.
   ``The tasks that face the reformers of Eastern Europe are
enormous,'' he told his colleagues.
   He said the reforms that have taken place must be consolidated.
   ``It will take time to establish new stable political and
economic structures,'' he said. ``We have no guarantee against
setbacks.''
   U.S. officials said they did not expect Baker's plan to be
implemented at the two-day meeting of the North Atlantic Council.
   The plan is designed to address the possibility of a reunified
Germany, anchoring it in a Western political and military alliance.
   East Germany has been Moscow's staunchiest ally in the Warsaw
Pact and the Soviet Union opposes German reunification.
   Within NATO itself, Baker is unlikely to encounter any serious
opposition.
   Woerner told a news conference Wednesday that he was ``fully in
line'' with Baker's approach.
   And Joe Clark, the Canadian foreign minister, said both
alliances ``can become instruments of stability'' amid the upheaval
in the Communist arena.
   Clark, at a separate news conference, said NATO would take on
more of a political role, with an eye on regional disputes and the
environment.

<TEXT>
   After the big weekend party
celebrating a heady revolution, the opposition woke up to a new
battle with the Communists over whether playwright Vaclav Havel
could be president of Czechoslovakia.
   The opposition appeared to have prevailed on Wednesday, when the
Communists agreed that Parliament would choose a president not
affiliated with any party. That apparently paved the way for Havel.
   But Communist Party spokesman Josef Hora today denied an
agreement had been reached. He said the party's negotiators were
not authorized to offer a binding commitment and that only the full
party congress on Dec. 20-21 can do that.
   The battle was a reminder that the Communist Party, which in
three weeks surrendered its 41-year monopoly on power, still wields
some clout.
   Tens of thousands of Communists are rumored to have handed in
their party cards since a Nov. 17 police crackdown on peaceful
student demonstrators drove a disgusted nation into revolt.
   But those left in the party, like everybody else in
Czechoslovakia, have already started campaigning for the free
parliamentary elections next year and are using what remains of
their power as skillfully as they can against the opposition.
   Picking right up on the newest trend in East European politics,
where the largest opposition groups in Hungary, East Germany and
Czechoslovakia, all are called ``forums,'' Communist reformers
founded a ``Democratic Forum'' to give the party a new, liberal
face.
   The image makeover is expected to go further with another
leadership overhaul at the party's extraordinary congress next
week, just a month after thediscredited hard-liners who had ruled
for 21 years were ousted.
   Meanwhile, thousands of orthodox Communists remain in powerful
positions in factories, offices, villages and towns across the
country, many of them hand-picked to run Czechoslovakia after the
1968 Warsaw Pact invasion.
   ``The factual power of the party is not broken yet,'' noted
Marek Benda, son of a well-known dissident and a student leader.
   The students, lauded as national heroes for their role in
starting the revolt, were the only ones who did not join in the
general celebrations of the end of one-party Communist rule.
   Instead, displaying the same political determination that
powered the revolt, they decided to continue their strike. Two of
their reasons were that local Communists were still obstructing
opposition activists in remote regions such as east Slovakia, and
that Havel was not yet president.
   ``We knew from the beginning that the Communists would try to
make things dark, and to cheat,'' said Benda.
   The tussle over the presidency proved the students' suspicions
right.
   Civic Forum spokesman Lubos Dobrovsky says it was implicitly
agreed last week at talks between all parties and the opposition
that a non-party Czech would become president.
   The description clearly fit Havel, a former political prisoner
who symbolizes Czechoslovakia's peaceful fight for freedom.
   The Communists won't say what happened to that agreement.
   Either there was a revolt by the Communist deputies in
Parliament, a conservative group picked in the last ``elections''
in 1986, or the Communist leaders decided to play for time.
   They demanded a referendum instead of a straight parliamentary
election on the presidency. Finally, they agreed on Wednesday that
the president should be elected by Parliament before the end of
January.
   In the eyes of the opposition, Havel is the only person who can
be president because, as Cerny put it, ``his slate is clean.''
   After four years in jail and 13 years standing up to police
harassment, Havel is viewed as a guarantor of the new freedoms just
won in Czechoslovakia, someone who will make sure there is no
backsliding.
   Thus Civic Forum has mounted an enthusiastic campaign for Havel,
handing out thousands of posters at its Prague headquarters for
visitors to take back to the country, and plastering thousands more
all around the city center.
   Many opposition activists are determined to go all out to make
Havel president.
   ``Any other president would delay the cause,'' said composer
Michael Kocab, a key negotiator with the Communists.
   He believes Havel will best calm the situation in
Czechoslovakia, encouraging reform and Western investment.
   Others, who did not want to be named, want Havel as president,
but say this is less important than the victory already won over
the Communists.
   A great debating point this week has been: which posters of
Havel give the would-be president the best image?
   ``This is not America. We are not running an American
campaign,'' Cerny told a Czech visiting Civic Forum headquarters
who complained about Havel's image. ``Either he wins as he is, or
he loses. We are not afraid of that.''

<HEAD>Court Sides With Shana Alexander and Medical Journal in Libel Cases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Author Shana Alexander didn't libel a New
York City psychologist accused of sleeping with a patient, New York
state's highest court ruled today.
   The Court of Appeals refused to reinstate psychologist Herman
Weiner's $1 million libel suit against Alexander and the Doubleday
book company, publisher of ``Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder: A
Family Album.''
   In a separate opinion today, the court also refused to reinstate
an Austrian research company's libel suit against a scientific
journal. A lower court had dismissed both lawsuits before any
damages were awarded.
   Alexander's book detailed the murder of Franklin Graham and the
trials of his grandson, Marc Schreuder, and daughter, Frances
Schreuder, for the crime.
   Weiner, an advocate of the controversial ``primal scream''
therapy, treated Ms. Schreuder, court papers said.
   The book reports a claim by Richard Behrens, a friend of Ms.
Schreuder's, that the woman ``always slept with her shrinks.''
According to the book, Graham's mother, sister and brother-in-law
said they had always ``suspected hanky-panky'' between Weiner and
Ms. Schreuder.
   Weiner, who is married, has denied having sex with Ms. Schreuder.
   But the court refused to reinstate the libel suit, saying
Alexander had sufficiently confirmed the challenged statement
because she or her researcher had talked to the people most
familiar with Ms. Schreuder's personal life.
   Under state case law, when a topic is one of legitimate public
concern, a defamed person must establish that the publisher was
``grossly irresponsible'' in gathering information to prove libel.
The court said the case didn't meet that standard.
   Alexander's lawyers had asked the court to rule that the
statement was opinion, and therefore deserving of constitutional
free speech protection. But the court refused.
   ``We leave for another day ... the question whether `opinion'
protection whould be enlarged to encompass the type of work that is
the focus of the present controversy,'' Judge Judith Kaye wrote in
a unanimous decision.
   The other libel case involved Immuno AG, a company that conducts
research on chimpanzees. The company sued the editor of the Journal
of Medical Primatology, accusing Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski of
knowingly publishing false material in a letter to the editor.
   Immuno AG said the letter, which accused the company of killing
chimpanzee mothers to get animals for testing, made it the target
of animal rights activists.
   The letter was preceded by an editors' note identifying its
writer as an animal rights activist and said that the company's
lawyers considered her statements to be inaccurate.
   The court, in a decision also by Judge Kaye, concluded that the
letter reflected someone's opinion and was protected by
constitutional free speech guarantees.

<TEXT>
   Parliament today postponed action on a
motion to abolish the Communist Party's 43-year-old monopoly on
power, provoking an outraged response from thousands of
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Bulgarians had widely expected the legislature to approve a
request by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to strike a
clause from the Constitution guaranteeing the party's leading role.
   After state radio announced the decision to defer discussion on
the motion for a month, more than 20,000 protesters outside
Parliament became angry.
   ``We are here!'' the demonstrators shouted in unison to the
Communist deputies inside. ``Come on out!''
   Officials justified the decision by citing a little-known law
stating that any motion to change the Constitution must be acted on
not less than a month after it is made but no later than three
months afterward.
   On Wednesday, the party's governing Central Committee closed a
three-day meeting by voting to propose that Parliament strike two
clauses from the constitution that enshrine the party's ``leading
role.''
   If the proposal had been adopted by Parliament, Romania and the
Soviet Union would have become the only Warsaw Pact countries where
the Communists' political supremacy is legally guaranteed.
   The Bulgarian party also expelled former hard-line leader Todor
Zhivkov from the party he ran unchallenged for 35 years until his
ouster last month, opening the possibility that Zhivkov could be
prosecuted for corruption.
   In other developments regarding Eastern Europe today:
   _East Germany met another opposition demand by abolishing the
agency that controls the country's once-feared secret police.
   _In Brussels, the 16 NATO foreign ministers approved the draft
of a treaty to that sets a ceiling of 275,000 for U.S. and Soviet
troops on foreign soil and sharp cutbacks in tanks, artillery and
other non-nuclear weapons. The NATO llies also considered a U.S.
plan that would gradually extend NATO's mission to the political
arena to better cope with the reforms in Eastern Europe.
   Petar Mladenov _ who replaced Zhivkov as Bulgaria's party chief
and has charted a reform course _ told the Central Committee
meeting on Wednesday to prepare for free elections in May.
   ``We have to ... conquer _ this time in the real sense of the
word _ the hearts and minds of the millions of Bulgarians.
   ``Soon we will face a nationwide exam: free and democratic
elections ... and it is there we must show that we are not only
worthy of, but also practically capable of, leading'' the country.
   Some of Mladenov's remarks at the closing session were carried
by BTA, the official news agency.
   Mladenov, who served as foreign minister for 18 years under
Zhivkov, has moved swiftly to oust associates of his predecessor
from the party's ruling Politburo in favor of people more likely to
embrace reform.
   Politburo member Andrei Lukanov told a news conference Wednesday
that the Central Committee would call also on Parliament to draft a
new electoral law ``guaranteeing the possibility of holding free
and democratic elections next year.'' Lukanov, considered second in
the new hierarchy after Mladenov, said the Communists were ready
for dialogue with ``all public forces and movements in Bulgaria.''
   Asked if the party was willing to go into the opposition if it
loses the elections, Lukanov said, ``We have to wait and see.
Elections, for a party, are there to be won, and we aspire to win
them.''
   At a Communist-sponsored rally Wednesday evening, about 60,000
people cheered Mladenov when he told them that party had decided to
scrap its guaranteed leading role.
   This has been a key demand of the opposition, for which
thousands of people expressed support in recent days by joining in
mass rallies.
   ``Our glorious party doesn't need this (guarantee) anymore,''
Mladenov told the rally outside party headquarters. ``Without it we
can win.''
   In a speech to the Central Committee on Monday, Mladenov said
the party should start talks with independent groups immediately
and relinquish the guarantee of sole power, as has been done this
year in Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. He
proposed that free elections be held by May.
   Lukanov said the decision to expel Zhivkov from the party was
unanimous. He said the former leader was ousted for ``gross
violations of laws and gross mistakes in politics which brought the
country to a serious crisis.''
   There have been widespread calls for the 78-year-old Zhivkov to
be prosecuted for corruption and abuses of power during his
autocratic rule.
   Zhivkov has been accused publicly of living lavishly in a
workers' state, in 13 opulent official residences and six hunting
lodges. His son, Vladimir, and Milko Balev, a close associate, were
also thrown out of the party.
   Officials say the residences and lodges will be turned over to
the public.

<HEAD>Liechtenstein's Bid for U.N. Membership Approved by Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VADUZ, Liechtenstein (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parliament of the principality
of Liechtenstein voted unanimously Thursday to have their wealthy
but tiny nation bid for membership in the United Nations.
   All 25 legislators backed a government proposal to send a formal
application to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar in
the spring.
   Hans Brunhart, the chief of government, said the vote was a
``historic step'' in Liechtenstein's foreign policy. If the U.N.
General Assembly approves the bid in its session next fall,
Liechtenstein would be the smallest member state.
   Chief advocate of a U.N. role has been Prince Hans Adam II, who
became head of state last month following the death of his father,
Franz Josef II.
   Hans Adam has said that only by joining the world body could
Liechtenstein obtain worldwide recognition as a sovereign state. He
said the principality might one day face ``locked doors'' if it
stayed outside.
   The road toward U.N. membership was cleared in March when
Liechtenstein voters narrowly rejected a proposed constitutional
amendment that would have made accession to any international body
subject to popular approval.
   In a 1986 referendum in neighboring Switzerland, a government
proposal to seek U.N. membership was defeated by a large majority.
   The export-oriented nation of 26,000 people is linked to
Switzerland in a customs and currency union, and has one of the
highest per-capita incomes in the world. After World War I, members
of the League of Nations, the forerunner of the U.N., had
successfully opposed admitting Liechtenstein, officially on the
grounds that it has no army, then a characteristic of as sovereign
nation.
   Since 1978, Liechtenstein is already a member of the Council of
Europe. In the past few decades, it also has joined several other
international organizations and is a signatory of the Helsinki Act
of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich has run up
more than $125,000 in legal fees in preparing his defense against
ethics charges and is appealing to past campaign contributors to
help pay the bills, an aide said Thursday.
   Spokesman Rich Galen said Gingrich has had two lawyers working
to prepare a defense so he would be ready should the House ethics
committee decide to launch a formal investigation of two compliants
that have been filed against him by Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark.
   ``It's like buying insurance,'' Galen said. ``You hope you don't
have to use it.''
   Both complaints are pending before the ethics committee. The
first alleges that Gingrich violated House rules and federal
campaign finance laws by getting 21 investors to put up $5,000 each
to promote his 1984 book, ``Window of Opportunity.''
   An outside counsel hired to evaluate that complaint concluded in
October that there was no reason for the panel to investigate
Gingrich, who rose to prominence in the House after filing the
ethics complaint that led to the resignation last June of former
House Speaker Jim Wright.
   A week after the outside counsel made its recommendation,
Alexander filed another complaint, along with 670 pages of
supporting documents, accusing the Georgia congressman of ethics
and campaign finance violations in seven new areas.
   Galen said the legal work on Gingrich's defense has been done
primarily by two Washington attorneys, former Arkansas Rep. Ed
Bethune and Dan Swillinger. He said other lawyers also may have
been consulted during work on the defense.
   Because Gingrich does not have enough money in his campaign
account to pay the attorneys' bills, Galen said a fund-raising
appeal to about 12,000 past contributors was mailed out last week.
   In his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission,
Gingrich reported that as of June 30, he had $35,847 in leftover
debts from his 1988 re-election campaign and had a cash balance in
his 1990 campaign account of $50,297.
   In the fund-raising letter, Gingrich described the ethics
complaints as a ``political witch hunt the liberals launched
against me earlier this year in the form of hundreds of baseless
charges.''
   ``This fight has severely weakened the financial condition of my
campaign committee,'' the letter continued. ``And this is precisely
the result these liberals wanted to achieve ... My campaign is very
financially vulnerable going into an election year.''
   Urging his contributors to ``show them they will have to fight
it out at the ballot box rather than through smears at the ethics
committee,'' Gingrich asked for ``a very special contribution of
$100, $75, $50 or even $25.''
   During the Wright investigation, Gingrich repeatedly used his
ethics campaign against the former speaker as a fund-raising tool
for a political action committee created to help elect Republicans
to state and local offices.

   About a dozen of Larry Mahoney's
relatives went to court today in a show of support and to hear him
tell his story about the night his pickup collided head-on with a
church bus and killed 27 people.
   The 36-year-old factory worker from rural Owen County was
expected to take the stand after cross-examination today of an
accident-reconstruction expert.
   Mahoney's parents, son, brother and sisters, were among those in
the courtroom at his murder trial.
   ``I would have crawled to get here,'' said Judy O'Donovan, his
sister.
   Mahoney has been ``very emphatic'' about taking the witness
stand and giving his version of events leading up to what
authorities say is the nation's worst drunken-driving accident,
said defense attorney William Summers.
   ``He wants to tell his story. He will tell his story,'' Summers
said Wednesday. ``He obviously feels bad for all the people
involved in this tragedy.''
   On Wednesday, a defense witness disputed official
reconstructions of the accident, saying Mahoney tried to avoid a
head-on collision with the bus. Wilbur R. Meredith III also
testified that the bus had several serious design flaws and was not
being used for its intended purpose.
   Twenty-four youngsters and three adults died and a dozen
children were seriously burned in the May 14, 1988, bus crash on
Interstate 71 south of Carrollton. The prosecution contends the
tragedy was caused after an intoxicated Mahoney, driving the wrong
way, crashed into the bus.
   Mahoney faces multiple life sentences if convicted of the
charges: 27 counts of murder, 42 of wanton endangerment, 12 of
assault and one of drunken driving.
   Meredith on Wednesday confirmed the prosecution's basic finding:
Mahoney's pickup truck hit the loaded church bus.
   But Meredith's account differed from those of the National
Transportation Safety Board and the State Police.
   The prosecution had said Mahoney took no evasive action before
colliding into the right front section of the bus.
   Meredith said Mahoney may have believed he was on a two-lane
highway when he came upon the bus and a blue Cadillac.
   The sedan was passing the bus on the right side and swerved to
avoid Mahoney's truck, he said. The pickup also swerved and
sideswiped the car. The truck then struck the front-right part of
the bus and spun away, he said.
   In the prosecution version, the truck struck the bus first,
rotated and hit the rear driver's side portion of the Cadillac.
   Meredith based his version on at least 400 computer simulations
of the crash, in part by using NTSB computer programs. The jury
viewed a videotape showing a computerized diagram of the crash,
with rectangular boxes representing the three vehicles.

<HEAD>Inventories Flashing Warning Signs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories climbed to their highest
level in two months in October, the government said Thursday, and
some analysts said that while the backlog had not reached dangerous
heights yet, it was flashing warning signs.
   ``We have not reached the point where we need to call out the
Marines, but there are some warning signals,'' said Robert G.
Dederick, chief economist for The Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   On the other hand, economist Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi
Bank in New York said that while businesses need be cautious, they
have better inventory control now and should be able to correct
problems before they become too serious.
   The Commerce Department said inventories climbed 0.4 percent to
a seasonally adjusted $793.9 billion in October after remaining
flat in September. The September report was revised from a 0.2
percent increase reported earlier and followed a 0.4 percent
advance in August.
   Business sales, meanwhile, dropped 0.7 percent to a seasonally
adjusted $519.2 billion in October after falling a revised 0.7
percent in September. September sales originally were reported to
have fallen 0.3 percent after rising 3 percent in August.
   The October business activity produced a slight increase, to
1.53, in the ratio of sales, meaning it would take 1.53 months to
exhaust inventories at the October pace. The ratio was 1.51 in
September and 1.50 in August.
   If inventories were to pile up excessively, it could mean
cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs, perhaps leading to a
recession. However, neither Dederick nor Niemira found the ratio at
a dangerous level yet.
   Niemira suggested it reflected the end of the slow-growth cycle
and predicted that ``things will begin to look better in 1990.''
   In fact, things began to look better on Wednesday when the
Commerce Department reported an 0.8 percent improvement in retail
sales in November, the biggest in four months, as shoppers began
the Christmas gift-buying season.
   That and other recent economic indicators reflect the easing in
Federal Reserve interest-rate policies, analysts say. The Fed had
kept a tight rein on credit for more than a year to slow inflation,
but began loosening its grip last June, permitting short-term rates
to fall gradually.
   The October report showed retail sales slumped 1.3 percent,
while retail inventories edged down 0.3 percent. Excluding the
automobile category, inventories rose 1 percent.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail automobile
inventories fell 3.7 percent in October, but Niemira said that
represented some problems with the government's seasonal adjustment
factor since car sales have plummeted since the end of September.
   Inventories at the manufacturing level, which represent about 45
percent of the total, rose 0.3 percent. Manufacturing sales, on the
other hand, dropped 0.6 percent.
   Wholesalers' inventories jumped 1.7 percent, while their sales
were off 0.1 percent.
   Overall, inventories were 4.1 percent above those of a year ago,
while sales increased 6.9 percent over October 1988.

<HEAD>Vatican Warns of Eastern Meditation Practices</HEAD>
<HEAD>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican warned Catholics on Thursday
that such methods as Zen, yoga and Transcendental Meditation can
``degenerate into a cult of the body,'' and it urged proper
Christian prayer.
   A document issued by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine
of the Faith, the pope's guardian of orthodoxy, said increased
attempts to fuse Eastern and Catholic meditation pose ``dangers and
errors.''
   It said these efforts ``need to have their contents and methods
ever subjected to a thorough-going examination so as to avoid the
danger of falling into syncretism'' _ the merging of different
religious practices.
   It was believed the first time the Vatican has addressed
publicly the problems raised by what it ackowledged is the strong
attraction for some Catholics of methods inspired by Eastern
religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism.
   The 23-page document, approved by Pope John Paul II and
addressed to bishops, said some forms of Eastern meditation can be
positive.
   ``One can take from them what is useful as so long as the
Christian conception of prayer, its logic and requirements are
never obscured,'' the document said.
   ``The love of God, the sole object of Christian contemplation,
is a reality which cannot be `mastered' by any method or
technique,'' it added.
   The congregation president, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of West
Germany, said the report was not condemning Eastern methods but
elaborating on guidelines for genuine Christian prayer.
   ``The fundamental affirmation of the document is very simple,''
Ratzinger told a news conference. ``Christian meditation is not
submersion in an impersonal divine atmosphere, in an abyss without
face or form.''
   Without identifying them, Ratzinger and other Vatican officials
said the document was directly especially to religious movements,
associations, prayer groups, monasteries and convents that have
strayed in the use of Eastern meditation practices.
   The document defined Christian prayer as a ``personal, intimate
and profound dialogue between man and God.''
   Such prayer ``flees from impersonal techniques or from
concentrating on oneself, which can create a kind of rut,
imprisoning the person praying in a spriritual privatism.''
   In a footnote, the document described Eastern methods as Zen,
Transcendental Meditation and yoga, which involves prescribed
postures and controlled breathing.
   The document said some Catholics turn to these techniques for
therapeutic reasons and to escape from the stress and pressures of
modern-day life.
   ``Without doubt, a Christian needs certain periods of retreat
into solitude to be recollected and, in God's presence, rediscover
his path,'' it said. ``Nevertheless ... his method of getting
closer to God is not based on any technique in the strict sense of
the word.''
   The church has faced the problem of ``erroneous ways of
praying'' from its early history, the document said. These forms
``seem once more to impress many Christians, appealing to them as a
kind of remedy, be it psychological or spiritual, or as a quick way
of finding God,'' it said.
   The document expressed particular concern over misconceptions
about body postures in meditation.
   It said the exercise of the ``Jesus Prayer,'' which is adapted
to the natural rhythm of breathing, can ``be of real help to many
people.'' The ``Jesus Prayer'' consists of repeating a formula of
invocation and supplication such as ``Lord Jesus Christ, Son of
God, have mercy on me.''
   But other forms of Eastern ``psychological symbolism'' can
``degenerate into a cult of the body and can lead surreptitiously
to considering all bodily sensations as spiritual experiences,''
the document said.
   ``Some physical experiences,'' it added, ``automatically produce
a feeling of quiet and relaxation, pleasing sensations, perhaps
even phenomena of light and of warmth, which resemble spiritual
well-being. To take such feelings for authentic consolations of the
Holy Spirit, would be a totally erroneous way of conceiving the
spriritual life.''
   A false mystical experience represents ``a kind of mental
schizophrenia which could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at
times, to moral deviations.''
   Ratzinger said improper forms of meditation are based on
egotistical concerns.
   ``The spiritual or infinite which has assumed an impersonal
dimension becomes simply a bath, in which the human being
strengthens himself ... Religion becomes a flight into pleasing
sensations or therapeutic means,'' he said.
   Asked whether he accepts yoga, Ratzinger said it was a
simplistic question which he could not answer simply. But he said
he opposed forms which ``become only a therapeutic technique or a
type of sport.''

<HEAD>Mayor Agrees to Close Leaning Tower for Repairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Pisa agreed Thursday to sign an order
to close the famed Leaning Tower to the public at an as yet
undisclosed date, the ANSA news agency said.
   Pisa Mayor Giacomo Granchi, who met with Minister for Public
Works Giovanni Prandini in Rome, agreed to sign the closure order
on Friday.
   Granchi agreed to sign the order after he was assured the
restoration work would begin as soon as possible, perhaps in the
next three months, ANSA said.
   Granchi, who had opposed closing the tower, said Monday he now
agrees it is necessary. However, he said the shutdown would not
begin until after the Christmas holidays.
   Prandini said the government would not reimburse Pisa for any
financial losses suffered by its tourist industry. An average 1,500
to 3,000 tourists climb the tower daily, paying a fee of $2.80 each.
   The 180-foot tower tilted almost from the time Bonnano Pisano
started building it in 1173 because the ground shifted underneath.
Experts in Pisa said it would not topple for another century if its
tilt pursued at the same rate.

<HEAD>Nurse Convicted of 2 Murders, Manslaughter, Negligent Homicide</HEAD>

   A nurse was convicted today of killing
four patients by injecting them with a powerful drug in a scheme to
revive them and look like a hero.
   A jury deliberated eight days before finding 27-year-old Richard
Angelo guilty of murder in two deaths, manslaughter in one and
criminally negligent homicide in the fourth. All four deaths
occurred in 1987 at a Long Island hospital.
   The Lindenhurst man was also convicted of assault in connection
with the deaths and on three counts of assault for giving
injections to a patient who survived. He was acquitted of assault
in connection with two other patients whose deaths could not
conclusively be linked to injections.
   The injections of a muscle relaxant occurred at Good Samaritan
Hospital in West Islip in the fall of 1987. Angelo said he had
planned to inject the patients, then be first on the scene to
revive them and be seen as a hero.
   Angelo could receive 50 years to life in prison at sentencing
Jan. 17 on the murder charges. He was ordered held without bail at
the Suffolk County jail, where he had been since his 1987 arrest.
   Defense attorney Eric Naiburg had conceded that Angelo injected
the patients and may have caused some of their deaths. But Naiburg
argued that Angelo was not aware the injections presented a grave
risk to the patients, a condition necessary for a murder conviction.
   Prosecutor John Collins, calling Angelo ``a monster in nurse's
whites,'' contended that Angelo had to know the risks, especially
after the first victim died.
   ``I'm not saying he intentionally killed anyone,'' Collins said
in closing arguments. ``I'm saying he just didn't give a damn.''
   Angelo, who was a nurse in the intensive care unit for about six
months, was arrested after a patient complained that Angelo had
injected him with an unknown drug.
   The patient, Gerolamo Kucich, a 75-year-old Yugoslavian,
testified that a man with a beard and a white coat gave him an
injection ``to make me feel better.'' Kucich, the only victim now
alive, said how almost immediately after the injection he couldn't
breathe and his body went limp.
   Authorities exhumed 33 bodies of patients at Good Samaritan who
died suspiciously during Angelo's tenure.
   The medical examiner found traces of Pavulon in six of the
bodies. He determined that Pavulon directly caused the death of
four of the victims buit that there was insufficient evidence in
the two others to determine if Pavulon contributed to the deaths.
   The prosecution linked Angelo to the Pavulon through Angelo's
statements and a Pavulon-laced syringe found in his apartment the
day before his arrest.

<HEAD>Signing of IMF Agreement Expected Early Next Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's expected signing of a letter of
intent on a key economic adjustment program with the International
Monetary Fund probably won't occur until next week, a government
source said Thursday.
   The agreement, in which Poland commits itself to specific
economic reforms in exchange for $700 million in standby IMF loans,
is expected to open the way to even larger Western loans and debt
rescheduling from other sources.
   IMF head Michel Camdessus, in Poland on Monday, had predicted
the signing of the letter of intent as early as this week.
   But a government official, demanding anonymity, said IMF
negotiators would have to remain in Poland a few extra days to
review economic reform bills approved by the government of Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki on Wednesday.
   ``The negotiations are still going on. They have gone through
about half the text. The mission probably will prolong its stay and
the letter probably will be signed at the beginning of next week,''
the source said.
   The agreement has been the linchpin of Poland's hope for massive
aid from the West and rescheduling of its $40 billion hard-currency
debt.
   The IMF, a Washington-based consortium of 152 nations in which
the United States is the largest shareholder, has played a key role
in helping Poland plan a major restructuring of its economy.
   Under the direction of Deputy Premier Leszek Balcerowicz, the
government is putting together more than a dozen bills to fight
inflation, restructure the economy to promote private ownership and
competition and transform the Polish zloty into an internally
convertible currency.
   Among the bills appoved by the Council of Ministers on Wednesday
was one defining the concept of an unemployed worker, setting out
procedures for laying off workers and providing for unemployment
benefits.
   The legislative package, the most extensive economic reform
program ever attempted by an East bloc government, is to be
submitted Sunday to the Parliament for approval. The target date of
implementing the program is Jan. 1.

<BYLINE>China Praises Scowcroft Visit, Suggests Fang Lizhi Solution ^By
JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China thanked President Bush on Thursday for
sending a special envoy to Beijing and suggested a solution was
possible for Fang Lizhi, the pro-democracy dissident hiding in the
U.S. Embassy.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua, in a weekly briefing
devoid of the anti-American rhetoric common in recent months, also
said he hoped U.S.-China ties, badly strained by the June military
crackdown on pro-democracy dissent in which hundreds of protesters
were killed, could be normalized soon.
   Jin, however, declined to say whether China would make any
concessions or change its policies as a result of the weekend visit
by National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, the first senior U.S.
official to visit China since Bush banned high-level exchanges in
June.
   Democratic congressmen have sharply criticized the visit,
accusing Bush of ``kowtowing'' to Chinese leaders responsible for
the bloody quelling of the Tiananmen protest movement.
   ``We appreciate President Bush's action to send his emissary Mr.
Scowcroft to China for a visit,'' Jin said.
   ``The Chinese government sets great store by the Sino-U.S.
relations, and believes that with joint efforts, China and the
United States will be entirely able to overcome the existing
difficulties and restore to normal soon their relations and even
push them to further development.''
   Asked about Fang, who took sanctuary in the U.S. Embassy with
his wife after troops crushed the student movement in June, Jin
said: ``That's a sensitive question involving China's sovereignty
law and norms of international law.''
   In a statement suggesting China was open to negotiations on
Fang, he added: ``To resolve this problem requires the efforts of
both sides.''
   On previous occasions, the Foreign Ministry always has stated
that Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, are counterrevolutionary
criminals wanted by Chinese police and demanded that the U.S. side
hand them over immediately.
   Jin also soft-pedaled other issues, such as sanctions against
the licensing of three American-made communications satellites that
China hopes to launch for Australian and Hong Kong concerns.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that no
decision has been reached on a possible waiver on the export ban
for the satellites.
   Jin commented that the issuance of export licenses would
``facilitate smooth cooperation'' between the two sides and ``the
Chinese side would welcome it.''
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman also stressed several times that
although differences remain, ``under the current circumstances,
where the international situation is undergoing the most profound
changes since the end of World War II, the constant exchange of
contacts between China and the United States is both necessary and
beneficial.''
   He said both sides were ``gratified with the results'' of the
Scowcroft visit.
   In one move possibly linked to the visit, the Foreign Ministry
on Wednesday approved the accreditation for a Beijing resident
correspondent from the U.S. government-financed Voice of America.
   China expelled VOA Beijing correspondent Alan Pessin in June
after charging that VOA radio broadcasts, heard by millions of
Chinese, were spreading rumors about the pro-democracy
demonstrations and the government's bloody suppression of them.
   The application for Pessin's replacement has been pending for
four months.
   China continues to jam VOA's Mandarin and Cantonese broadcasts,
as it has since June, but does not interfere with English-language
broadcasts.

   A fire at a retirement home early today
killed four residents and sent people in wheelchairs and pajamas
into the freezing cold. At least 23 people were hurt in the home's
third fatal blaze in 13 years.
   TV crews dropped their cameras to help rescue people from the
burning six-story Shenandoah Homes Retirement Community, and
residents designated as floor ``fire captains'' knocked on doors
and led their neighbors to safety.
   The dead, ages 77 to 86, were found in four rooms on the third
floor, where the fire broke out about 2:30 a.m., but the blaze
spread heavy smoke to the upper floors before it was brought under
control 2{ hours later, authorities said.
   About 135 residents, some using wheelchairs and dressed only in
pajamas, were evacuated in 19-degree cold to a roller skating rink,
authorities said. Some were sent to hospitals, others picked up by
relatives.
   ``The smoke was horrible,'' said Louise Dudney, 79, a
sixth-floor resident sitting on a bench at the rink. ``I thought I
couldn't make it but told myself I'm going to make it. I ran out
and started knocking on doors.''
   Twenty-three people were taken to three hospitals, with most of
them suffering from smoke inhalation, chest pains or injuries
related to falling, authorities said. The injured included three
firefighters and a police officer.
   Seven victims remained hospitalized this afternoon, one listed
in serious condition with smoke inhalation. The rest were treated
and released.
   ``It is a sad day,'' said Roanoke County Fire Chief Tommy Fuqua.
   It was the third fatal fire at the brick building, which has no
sprinkler system but was equipped with smoke detectors and fire
barriers, authorities said. In 1976, a fire killed four residents
of the home. Three months earlier, a blaze started by a dropped
cigarette killed a woman.
   Today's blaze came two months after a fire at a nursing home in
Norfolk killed 12 residents. That home had no sprinklers, prompting
demands that the Legislature make such systems mandatory at all
nursing homes.
   The cause of the fire today was under investigation.
   ``They have all the equipment they are required to have,'' Fuqua
said. ``The alarm system worked, the smoke detectors worked.''
   The fire caused major damage to only one room, said Fire Marshal
Ken Sharp.
   R.C. Wilson, the retirement home chaplain, said able residents
had been trained as ``fire captains'' or ``fire assistants.''
   Ottis Burgher, administrator for the home, said, ``It was just a
marvel how these elderly people reacted under pressure.''
   Early reports incorrectly described the home, which has 124
apartments, as a nursing home.
   Only one floor is licensed by the state as a home for adults, a
lower level of care than a nursing home, according to Richard
Martin of the Virginia Department of Social Services and Welfare.
The rest of the building was not subject to state regulation, he
said.
   Fuqua said officers and camera crews from TV stations were the
first to arrive, and some reporters and photographers helped in the
rescue.
   ``Everybody that was out here were heroes,'' Fuqua said. ``They
evacuated people before they even tried to put out the fire.
   Killed were Rada Powell, 77; Edna S. Aliff, 77; Linard H. Mann,
86, and Marcie L. Keith, 80, the Sheriff's Department said.

<TEXT>
   The voluntary repatriation of tens
of thousands of Ethiopians who sought refuge in Somalia 12 years
ago during a war between the nations should begin in March,
officials said Thursday.
   The repatriation is dependent, however, on Somalia completing
registration of the refugees by the end of February, said officials
of Ethiopia, Somalia and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
after a two-day meeting.
   The refugees are predominantly ethnic Somali Ethiopians who took
refuge in Somalia during the two nations' war in 1977-78 over a
piece of arid land in southeastern Ethiopia called the Ogaden,
which is principally inhabited by the nomadic ethnic Somalis.
   The number of refugees has never been certain. Somalia says
there are 700,000, the U.N. group puts the figure at 160,000, and
Ethiopia says they number about 100,000.
   Somalia has begun registering refugees in southern Somalia, but
not in the north where fighting has intensified between government
troops and Somali rebels.
   During the registration, refugees will be asked if they want to
return to Ethiopia. Those who don't will be granted limited
assistance to help them settle in Somalia.

<HEAD>Ex-Policeman Confesses to Death Squad Killing of Activist</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DAVID CRARY</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former policeman pleaded
guilty Thursday to the murder of an anti-apartheid activist, saying
he belonged to a police assassination squad and acted on orders
from superiors.
   Activists for years have suspected the existence of police death
squads, but Butana Nofomela's statement marked the first time
anyone confessed in court to serving on such a unit.
   In another development, recently freed African National Congress
leader Walter Sisulu said the government was trying to drive a
wedge between his jailed colleague, Nelson Mandela, and militant
black leaders outside prison.
   Sisulu, a co-defendant of Mandela's who was freed in October
after 26 years in prison, said he was surprised to learn of
Wednesday's meeting between Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk.
But Sisulu said the talks did not contradict the ANC's position
that conditions are not yet right for negotiations with the
government.
   ``The government always wants to drive a wedge between him and
leaders outside,'' Sisulu said in a radio interview. ``We are quite
aware of that and I think Mr. Mandela is very much aware of that.''
   ``Exchanging views with an individual is not negotiations,''
Sisulu said.
   Sisulu said Mandela was likely to explain his position during
meetings planned at his prison quarters next week with leaders of
the militant Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's
largest labor federation.
   De Klerk was expected to discuss Mandela's status when he
travels to a meeting Friday with Mozambique's President Joaquim
Chissano. The South African Press Association said there was
speculation de Klerk could announce a date for Mandela's release in
a speech Saturday commemorating the Day of the Vow, a major holiday
for the Afrikaners who control the government.
   Mandela, the country's best-known black leader, has been
imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for plotting
an anti-government sabotage campaign. Six ANC leaders convicted
along with him, including Sisulu, were freed in October.
   Nofomela, the confessed death squad member, first made his
allegations in an affidavit Oct. 19, the night before he was to
hang for a separate murder with no political overtones. Human
rights lawyers obtained a stay of execution so Nofomela could
assist in investigations of death squad activity.
   Subsequently, two ex-policemen named by Nofomela as death squad
members confessed in newspaper interviews that they were involved.
The issue has become a major national controversy.
   Last week, de Klerk rejected requests to appoint a judicial
inquiry commission, saying the allegations could be handled through
normal legal procedures. Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee announced
that Nofomela would be prosecuted for the 1981 stabbing of
Griffiths Mxenge, a black lawyer and activist from Durban.
   In a statement read in Magistrate's Court in Pietermaritzburg,
capital of Natal Province, Nofomela said he and three other black
policemen abducted Mxenge to a stadium, then kicked, punched and
stabbed him until he died.
   ``I was a member of the (police) special branch assassination
squad,'' Nofomela told the court. ``I was instructed by Brig.
(Willem) Schoon and Capt. (Dirk) Coetzee to proceed to Durban and
there to kill one Griffiths Mxenge.''
   Schoon, now retired, has not issued any statement on allegations
he ordered Mxenge's assassination.
   Coetzee, who has fled South Africa, made detailed claims about
death squad activities, including Mxenge's murder, in a newspaper
interview last month. Police have issued a warrant for Coetzee's
arrest.
   Nofomela's case was adjourned until Feb. 28.

<TEXT>
   South Florida's water managers
today responded to the worst dry spell in 27 years by imposing
restrictions on washing cars and watering lawns and golf courses in
the region of more than 4 million people.
   The governing board of the South Florida Water Management
District approved the restrictions 7-0, effective Monday in four
heavily populated counties from Key West to the West Palm Beach
area, 230 miles to the north.
   The board also approved a $410,000 media campaign to publicize
water conservation.
   The first regional water restrictions in nearly nine years are
the product of Miami's driest year since 1962, low water storage
levels and a long-range forecast for lower than normal rainfall in
the winter dry season. Rainfall this year has totaled about 42
inches, or 14 inches below normal.
   Tom MacVicar, deputy executive director of the water district,
said the region is entering its winter dry season, and more
stringent restrictions will follow unless the rainfall trend
changes.
   ``There's not much social cost to having a dirty car,'' MacVicar
said. ``There's a social cost to not having water.''
   ``Even if we do get a wet winter, the philosophy is we'll still
need the water restrictions,'' said district spokeswoman Ann
Overton. ``It's better to get people on board with the idea of
mandatory cutbacks while we still have a little bit of breathing
room rather than waiting until we have our backs against the wall.''
   The board limited residents of Monroe, Dade, Broward and Palm
Beach counties to lawn watering and car washing from 4 a.m. to 8
a.m. three days a week.
   Restrictions also were placed on golf courses, car washes,
agriculture, pool filling and rinsing off boats, Ms. Overton said.
Fountains and outdoor water displays would be turned off and
street, driveway and sidewalk washing banned.
   Enforcement is up to local authorities. The district has told
authorities that violations should be handled with a warning for a
first offense and fines starting at $25 for repeat offenses.
   Farmers have been asked for the past two months to cut back
their water use by 10 percent, and those voluntary limits will
continue.
   Similar restrictions are in place from the area north of Tampa
across the peninsula to Jacksonville and as far west as Blountstown
on the Florida Panhandle.
   California also continues to have problems. Rainfall has reached
only 60 percent of normal for this time of year, and the central
part of the state is facing drought for a fourth straight year.
   ``From San Jose to the Mexican border is the urban area hardest
hit by the continuing drought,'' Suzanne Butterfield, deputy chief
and drought response coordinator for the state Department of Water
Resources, said Wednesday.
   On average, water in California's reservoirs is at 75 percent of
normal for this time of year, but some reservoirs along the coast
are ``bone dry,'' Butterfield said. The extended drought has meant
water rationing or strict conservation programs for 10 million
residents in 130 California communities, she said.
   In South Florida, public agencies are pressing to meet the 15
percent water use reduction goal set by the district. The
Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Authority serving the Miami area has cut
water pressure and wants to impose a 10 percent surcharge on all
water bills as an inducement to conserve.
   Lake Okeechobee, the largest freshwater lake outside the Great
Lakes and a primary drinking water source for South Florida, is
about 3 feet below normal.
   Miami received 42.23 inches of rain for the year through
Wednesday compared with 42.27 inches in 1962 and 41.78 inches in
1961, National Weather Service records show.

   Italian actress Silvana Mangano was
hospitalized in a coma and was near death, a doctor said Thursday.
   Mangano, 59, had entered Luz Hospital on Monday and underwent
surgery for a tumor between her lungs, said Dr. Antonio Aguado,
chief of the intensive care unit.
   ``There is no hope that her condition will improve,'' he said,
adding that she was ``near clinical death.''
   The tumor had left Mangano unable to digest food, a condition
that forced doctors to perform surgery. He did not say how long she
had been in a coma.
   Her three daughters were in Madrid to be with her, Spanish
National Radio reported. A son died in an air crash in Alaska in
1981.
   Mangano gained fame for her acting in 1940s and 1950s
neo-realist Italian films.
   She portrayed a sensual country girl in the 1948 film ``Bitter
Rice.''
   Italian film director Giuseppe De Santis cast her in the part
after she had won the Miss Rome beauty contest and began playing
supporting roles in post World War II films.
   In 1949, she married Dino de Laurentiis, the producer of
``Bitter Rice.'' They separated in 1983.
   She worked with the most prestigious Italian film directors,
including Vittorio de Sica, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Mario Monicelli
and Luchino Visconti.
   In her most recent work, she appeared alongside Marcello
Mastroianni in the film ``Dark Eyes.''

   Hiromasa Ezoe, whose company gave its name to a
scandal that brought down a government and tarnished the Japanese
establishment, goes on trial Friday, charged with buying influence
and favors.
   Being tried with him are Toshiro Ono, an executive of Recruit
Co., the information conglomerate Ezoe founded, and two politicians
accused of taking bribes: Takao Fujinami, a former Cabinet
minister, and Katsuya Ikeda of the opposition Komeito (Clean
Government) party.
   If convicted, the defendsants could be sentenced to five years
in prison each.
   Their trial is the last of five, which began Nov. 22 in Tokyo
District Court and will last for months as the legal system delves
into allegations of corruption in in the cozy relations between
Japanese government and business.
   The Recruit scandal began in summer 1988 and brought down Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, who resigned last spring after
acknowledging he received large donations from Recruit.
   Other key figures in the governing Liberal Democratic Party have
been sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of ranking
bureaucrats has been questioned because of gifts they accepted from
Recruit.
   Ezoe, 53, is charged with seven counts of bribery and Ono, a
39-year-old former company department head, with two counts.
   Fujinami, 56, was chief Cabinet secretary under Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, Takeshita's predecessor. He is accused of
receiving 20 million yen ($140,000) and 10,000 shares in
Recruit-Cosmos, a subsidiary whose stock was offered to influential
people at a reduced price before going on the market.
   He allegedly put pressure on the Labor Ministry not to change
the traditional season for recruiting college graduates, which
would have hurt Recruit's sales of job-placement magazines.
   Ikeda, 52, is harged with receiving 2 million yen ($14,000) for
himself, 5 million yen ($35,000) for his wife and 5,000 shares in
Recruit-Cosmos for his brother.
   According to prosecutors, he gave pro-Recruit speeches in
Parliament in return. Ikeda resigned his seat; Fujinami remained in
Parliament, but resigned from his party.
   The other trials involve six bureaucrats and two other Recruit
executives.
   Prosecutors must show the point at which a gift becomes a bribe.
Japanese law says bribery occurs when a public official or
politician receives money or valuables from people or companies the
official is in a position to supervise.
   Recruit offered millions of discount shares in Recruit-Cosmos to
hundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen before the
stocks were available to the general public.
   When it was offered on the over-the-counter market, the price of
the stock shot up and the insiders made large profits. Fujinami's
shares were said to have gained him 30 million yen ($215,000).
   ``We offered stocks to those who would bring benefits to Recruit
directly or indirectly. It was a form of advance investment. I
regard the stock transaction as a business practice but I admit it
contains some peculiar aspects,'' Ezoe was quoted as telling
prosecutors, who read the statements in a related trial Wednesday.
   On Wednesday, the former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp., Hisashi Shinto, 79, acknowledged he made about 21
million yen ($145,000) in 1986 on Recruit-Cosmos shares, but denied
favoring Recruit with special treatment when it entered the
telecommunications market.
   ``I accepted the offer of shares, but I never regarded it as a
bribe,'' he said. ``Rejecting such an offer is considered rude in
Japan.''
   Defense lawyers have argued such favors were normal between
businesses and the powerful bureaucracy in Japan, where an entire
industry has evolved around the custom of exchanging gifts to
cement personal and business ties.
   Businessmen say such gifts are not aimed at winning specific
favors but at establishing relationships with business associates,
supervising agencies and politicians that make it easier to do
business with them.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has pledged to reform Japan's money
politics, but few measures have been enacted.
   On Wednesday, Parliament passed legislation providing punishment
for politicians who give donations for weddings and other
ceremonies they do not attend, and for voters who demand such gifts.

   The Rev. Bruce Ritter, founder of the Covenant
House for runaways, today denied charges of financial improprieties
leveled by a former male prostitute the priest has helped.
   ``They are simply nonsense,'' Ritter said. The priest said that
news reports on the matter have been inaccurate and that a special
audit just completed by an accounting firm showed ``no misuse of
funds whatsoever.''
   A day earlier, the district attorney said an investigation of
the allegations was still at an early stage.
   ``No determination has been made as to the truth of the
allegations, nor can such a determination be made until the
investigation has been concluded,'' Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau said in a statement Wednesday.
   The New York Post first disclosed the investigation, reporting
Tuesday that it began when a former male prostitute told
prosecutors the Roman Catholic priest provided him with an
apartment, money and gifts and took him on trips.
   A law enforcement source identified the young man for The
Associated Press as Timothy Warner, 20.
   The Post reported today that investigators had the youth wear a
recording device during a conversation with Ritter in an effort to
confirm allegations that they had a sexual relationship. It is not
clear what Warner recorded.
   Ritter, a 62-year-old Franciscan priest, had not spoken publicly
about the allegations before today. But the Post quoted him earlier
this week as denying any sexual misconduct and suggesting that
emotional problems led the young man to make ``scurrilous''
allegations.
   The shelter's chief executive officer, James Harnett, and
Ritter's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, denied any financial wrongdoing by
Ritter or Covenant House. Covenant House officials have said that
such expenditures are normal and that Warner was put in a ``safe
house'' to keep him away from his criminal past.
   ``There is no case and there never was any case,'' Arkin said.
   ``I think it was outrageous and disgusting for the district
attorney to outfit this kid with a wire to try to entrap Father
Ritter,'' Harnett said. ``I can tell you Father Ritter is a lot
calmer about this than I am.''
   Ritter founded Covenant House for homeless teen-agers in 1969
and has built it into an $85 million-a-year operation with seven
shelters in the United States, one in Toronto and four in Latin
America. More than 90 percent of its funding is private.
   Morgenthau said Covenant House is cooperating with the
investigation and subpoenas have not been necessary.
   Ritter brought Warner to New York from New Orleans in February
after the young man told the priest he wanted to escape
prostitution.
   Harnett acknowledged Ritter and Warner took trips in which they
were alone together.
   The two men attended the wedding in June of a Covenant House
staff member in Wyomissing, Pa., and shared a room. He said Ritter
`is categorical that he and the kid slept in separate beds and
nothing sexual went on, nothing.''
   In February, they spent a night at a board member's Rhinebeck,
N.Y., country home, which is used frequently for group outings. The
two stayed in a guest house, Harnett said.
   The Post reported Wednesday that an employee at Covenant House
had said Ritter might have been involved with a second youth. The
district attorney's office refused to comment.
   In a statement supporting Ritter, Cardinal John O'Connor said,
``In all my personal association with Father Ritter and those who
work with him, I have seen nothing but self-sacrifice and
commitment to the most abandoned in society.''

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary Brady Undergoes Successful Hip Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady
successfully underwent elective surgery Thursday to replace his
arthritic right hip, the department reported.
   ``Everything went fine,'' said a department official, who
declined to be identified. ``The secretary's doing great.''
   It is uncertain when Brady will be released from the hospital,
but recovery is expected to last three to six weeks, the official
said. During that time, Deputy Secretary John Robson will serve as
acting secretary.
   Despite his absence from the department, Brady will remain in
touch with Treasury officials and take part in major decisions just
as he does when traveling outside the capital, officials said.
   Among the pending decisions are the fiscal 1991 budget, which
President Bush plans to send to Congress on Jan. 22, and the
contents of Bush's State of the Union address.
   Officials said Brady chose this time for the operation because
Congress is in recess until next month.
   Officials refused to disclose where the operation occurred.
   Brady, who became treasury secretary in August 1988, has
suffered for some time from the arthritic hip, which lately has
caused him to walk with a slight limp.
   Until his hip worsened, Brady enjoyed playing tennis,
occasionally as Bush's partner, and was a low-handicap golfer.

   Johnny Paycheck's lawyer asked the Ohio
Supreme Court to knock down by three years a maximum 9{-year prison
sentence the country singer received for shooting and wounding a
man in a bar in 1985.
   Ralph C. Buss told the justices in arguments Wednesday that
Paycheck should not have been given a mandatory three-year sentence
for use of a firearm.
   Paycheck orginally was charged with felonious assault with a
gun, but a jury convicted him of a lesser offense of aggravated
assault. The defense has contended the lesser charge did not
provide for the firearm specification.
   In February, the singer began serving a 7-to-9{-year sentence in
the Chillicothe Correctional Institute in southern Ohio. The
conviction stemmed from an incident in which Paycheck shot a man in
a bar.
   The 48-year-old Paycheck, whose real name is Donnie Lytle, is
best known for his 1978 hit ``Take This Job and Shove It.''

   Nobel Peace Prize winner the Dalai Lama
braved extreme cold to visit the reindeer herding Lapps of the
Arctic Norway.
   The exiled religious and political leader of Tibet called the
visit to the north Wednesday the high point of his trip to Norway,
where he received the Peace Prize on Sunday.
   The Buddhist monk, usually clad in thin robes, bundled himself
in thicker cloth and donned sturdy western-style shoes for the 38
degree below Zero weather.
   Lapps and Tibetans have much in common, he said, including a
deep respect for nature. The Lapps, traditionally nomadic herders,
are a tiny minority in northern Scandinavia and the Soviet Union.
   ``Our two peoples also share the will to struggle for our
cultural identity, our languages and a future in the place we
belong,'' he said.
   The Dalai Lama fled his Himalayan homeland in 1959, nine years
after Chinese troops rolled in. He has said that China is trying to
wipe out Tibet's culture.
   ``We sympathize with Tibet. We understand the threat of cultural
extinction because Norway once tried to erase everything about the
Lapp culture,'' said Ole Herik Magga, a Lapp political leader. In
the past, the Norwegian government tried to have the Lapps
assimilated into the country's mainstream.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson warned high
school students Thursday that drugs are more of a threat to black
Americans than the Ku Klux Klan had ever been.
   ``What difference does it make if the doors are wide open and
you are too drunk to stagger through the door?'' Jackson asked the
students, who have been offered free college educations by
businessman Ewing Kauffman if they stay drug free.
   ``No one should have to beg you, no one should have to bribe
you, no one should have to give you an apple to make you save
yourself,'' Jackson said. ``Opportunity just gets you on the court,
it doesn't make you win.''
   Kauffman, founder of Marion Laboratories and owner of the Kansas
City Royals baseball team, has offered to pay college costs for
more than 500 students at Westport High School. In return, they
must stay off drugs, attend school regularly and graduate, and
avoid teen-age parenthood. He also has offered the program, called
Project Choice, to about 150 students in Kansas City, Kan.
   When Jackson asked the students to stand if they knew anyone in
their age group who had died or been jailed because of drugs, about
one-third of the crowd stood. But when he asked if they knew anyone
who sold drugs, almost all the students stood.
   ``Drug-free is just point zero,'' the civil rights leader said.
``It isn't enough to be sober and ignorant, or sober and
undisciplined. If you can't read, people might not laugh at you,
but they won't hire you, either.''

   U.S. criticism of Britain's forced repatriation of
Vietnamese from Hong Kong has stirred resentment in the Thatcher
government and raised new doubts about the special relationship
between the two nations.
   Britain also faces more criticism from an announcement expected
shortly that it will admit only a select minority of Hong Kong
Chinese if things go wrong when the colony reverts to China in 1997.
   Officially, Foreign Office Minister Francis Maude described as
``misguided'' a U.S. State Department statement Tuesday that the
forced repatriation of 51 Vietnamese boat people was unacceptable.
The deportations were the first of thousands expected in the coming
years.
   But the British government resentment goes deeper than the
diplomatic parlance.
   ``It is no good complaining unless they are prepared to take
more (Vietnamese refugees),'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was
quoted as saying in a newspaper interview Thursday, referring to
the United States and other critics.
   ``I know what their reason against taking more is. It is that
the more they take, the more will come,'' she was quoted as saying
in the London's Daily Star. ``One doesn't like having to do it, but
we have to think of our responsibility to the people of Hong Kong.''
   It is a phrase likely to be used against her when, in an
announcement scheduled before the end of the year, the government
says how many of the 6 million Hong Kong Chinese will be granted
rights of residence in Britain. They include 3.25 million people
who now have British passports without the right of abode.
   Most analysts expect Britain will give residence rights to
between 100,000-200,000 Hong Kong Chinese, mostly people who have
worked for the British administration or members of the colony's
thriving entrepreneurial class.
   The latter find it easiest to get into other Western countries,
notably Canada, the United States and Australia. They already
leaving at the rate of about 1,000 a week.
   British officials complain privately that what one called a U.S.
``hang-up'' about Vietnam has brought London and Washington into
open conflict over the forced repatriation of Vietnamese refugees
classified as economic migrants.
   The clash comes when Mrs. Thatcher is already widely portrayed
as sidelined by the United States. The 12-nation European Economic
Community as a bloc and West Germany in particular have become the
focus of U.S. attention amid the rapid changes in Eastern Europe.
   There are signs the dispute will get worse as thousands more of
the 44,000 Vietnamese whom Britain is determined to deport are
bundled out of the colony with TV cameras recording scenes of
emotion.
   ``Given the major changes in Europe, it is just an enormous
waste of political capital for Britain and the United States to
have a row about this,'' said Gerald Segal, an analyst at London's
Royal Institute of International Affairs.
   ``But it is going to get worse without any question,'' Segal
said in an interview. ``Because of the focus on West Germany, the
United States may also feel that there is little cost in having a
major argument with Britain on the repatriation issue. If it comes
to that, I think Britain will turn fairly nasty.''
   Right now, Britain sounds aggrieved at the universal criticism
from its allies as Hong Kong, the last significant remains of a
once globe-encircling empire, turns into an international
controversy.
   ``We do not look for the world's applause, but we are entitled
to ask for the world's understanding,'' said Sir David Ford, chief
secretary in the British-run Hong Kong administration.
   ``This is not a role or responsibility we have sought. It is one
that geography and circumstances have thrust upon us.''
   As well as attracting Western disapproval, Mrs. Thatcher is
under ferocious attack from British opposition parties and some
newspapers over the repatriation issue.
   The government, whose move is highly popular with the Hong Kong
Chinese and Beijing officials, retorts that no one else has offered
to take the boat people.
   More than 90 percent are peasants from north Vietnam, while the
majority of the 900,000 Vietnamese settled in the United States
since the war ended in 1975 are from the south.
   British officials said the United States is reluctant to take
the northerners.

   The United States is turning up the heat in an
effort to persuade Syria to kick out the terrorist believed
responsible for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, a State
Department source said Thursday.
   ``It's a matter of degree, of frequency and of language,'' the
source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said about
increased diplomatic contacts with Syria.
   The official said the increased pressure did not include direct
threats, but that there had been a measured turning up of the heat
in the most recent contacts, some of which have come through U.S.
Ambassador Edward Djerejian.
   Threats, the source said, would be counterproductive against a
tough-minded leader such as Syrian President Hafez Assad. The
source also said that U.S. relations with Syria already are cool,
leaving the United States little with which to bargain.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United
States is unhappy with Syria's refusal to eject Ahmed Jibril,
believed to have engineered the Pan Am attack a year ago.
   The headquarters of Jibril's organization, the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, are in Damascus, and
he has at least one training camp outside Damascus.
   ``This is a major item on our bilateral agenda with Syria,''
Boucher said in response to a question Thursday at the daily State
Department briefing. ``To date we're not satisfied with the Syrian
governmnent's responses and we think the Syrian government can do
more.''
   Boucher said the United States had had ``extensive discussions''
and has made ``repeated demarches ... on the issue of terrorism and
Syrian support for terrorism groups.''
   Syria's response has been to insist that it be shown hard
evidence linking Gibril to the explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland,
that killed 270 people. The United States has been reluctant to do
so because such a move might jeopardize the criminal investigation
or expose sensitive intelligence sources.
   ``The Syrian government, at the highest levels, has told us that
if it is presented with firm evidence that any group or individuals
within its purview are responsible for Pan Am 103, the Syrian
government will take action against them,'' Boucher said.
   However, the department source said the United States believes
the Syrians ``should bounce Jibril, just as they bounced Abu
Nidal,'' another terrorist, because of his overall record of
violence independent of the Pan Am case.
   U.S. officials are unsure whether Assad knew of the plans for
the Pan Am bombing before it occurred, but believe he now is well
aware of Jibril's involvement.
   Jibril is a former Syrian army major believed to have continuing
close ties to Syrian intelligence.

<TEXT>
   The daring escape of three war
correspondents from a Confederate prison 125 years ago will be
commemorated this weekend in a ceremony organizers hope will also
focus attention on hostage Terry Anderson's plight.
   On Dec. 18, 1864, New York Daily Tribune reporters Albert
Richardson and Junius Browne and the Cincinnati Gazette's William
Davis masterminded an escape from Salisbury Prison after 19 months
in captivity.
   Contemporaries referred to their 340-mile journey to freedom
across the Blue Ridge Mountains as ``The Walk of the Journalists.''
   ``These gentlemen were not unlike Terry Anderson,'' said Mark
McDonald, the executive director of the Historic Salisbury
Foundation Inc., which is co-sponsoring the event with the Society
of Civil War Correspondents. ``They were 19th century political
prisoners. They were imprisoned not because they took up arms but
because of what they wrote.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, has been held hostage since his capture in Beirut, Lebanon,
in March 1985.
   ``Wherever Terry is being held, we fervently wish he might find
some inspiration from the successful struggle of Richardson, Browne
and Davis,'' McDonald said.
   Joining the journalists in their escape 125 years ago were
Connecticut merchant marine Capt. Thomas E. Wolfe and Sgt. Charles
Thurston of the 6th New Hampshire Infantry.
   McDonald said Richardson and Browne, who were captured during
the battle of Vicksburg in May 1863, were granted special status at
the prison.
   ``Richardson was given the job of collecting usable clothing
from the dead,'' he said Wednesday. Richardson was given a pass
that allowed him to go outside the prison walls to perform his
duties.
   The reporters later used the pass to trick the guards and make
their escape.
   ``The escape itself did not feature any cloak and dagger,''
McDonald said. ``Their journey had a lot more daring associated
with it.''
   McDonald said they had a good reason to escape when they did.
   ``The current commander of the prison, Major John Ghee, was
being replaced by General Bradlee Johnson,'' a strict
disciplinarian, he said. ``They decided to get out while the
getting was good.''
   Twenty-six days later, on Jan. 13, 1865, they arrived in
Union-held Knoxville, Tenn.
   Within a day of their arrival, the Tribune, which was run by
staunch abolitionist Horace Greeley, reported their exploits under
the headline ``Out of the Jaws of Death.''
   Salisbury Prison, which was constructed around an abandoned
cotton mill, held more than 10,000 prisoners in October 1864.
Between that date and February 1865, 3,419 of its prisoners died.
   The prison was destroyed by Union cavalry in April 1865.
   Beginning on Friday, the escape will be commemorated in downtown
Salisbury with lectures, a walking tour, living history portrayals,
a banquet and a re-creation.
   The escape will be re-created Saturday at 3:30 p.m., the hour of
the flight.
   Gerald A. Regan, a copy editor with USA Today, and U.S. Naval
Academy English professor Robert Madison will portray Richardson
and Browne. They will also give readings from books the Tribune
reporters wrote about their Civil War exploits.
   ``This is not a story of North vs. South, but of men caught up
in a war who refuse to accept captivity,'' said Regan. ``They would
be free because they would accept nothing less, no matter what the
odds or dangers.
   ``Journalists don't set out to be heroes, but heroic efforts are
sometimes required in the pursuit of the news,'' he said.
   Among the weekend's speakers will be Allen Ellis, an assistant
professor at Northern Kentucky University and a descendant of Dan
Ellis, who helped guide the journalists over the mountains to
freedom.

<HEAD>Cartoonist Back At Work After 14-Month Sabbatical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gary Larson, who took a 14-month
sabbatical from producing his popular cartoon ``The Far Side,'' is
back at the drawing table.
   The first of his new panels will be for release starting Jan. 1,
John P. McMeel, president of Universal Press Syndicate, said
Wednesday. More than 900 newspapers _ more than before the
sabattical began _ will carry the cartoon.
   Larson, known for a bizarre outlook expressed primarily through
animal characters and nerdy people, took a break from active
cartoon production starting in October 1988. During the interim,
newspapers buying the service received ``classic'' selections from
his earlier work.
   Larson said he took the sabbatical because he needed a break
``after nine years of deadlines.'' He Larson and his wife visited
Africa and the Amazon in South America during the break and spent
four months in New York, where he studied jazz guitar. Their home
is in Seattle.
   His only drawing, he said in a statement released by the
syndicate, was a cover for an album by guitarist Herb Ellis, ``and
the few ideas I wrote down were things that seeped in unavoidably.''
   He admitted to mixed feelings about being back at work.
   ``I currently feel fresh and recharged, and a reduced workload
I'm sure will play a big role in maintaining that feeling,'' he
said. ``But, as I'm sure anyone who has had an opportunity to take
a full year off will agree, that first Monday morning back to work
is quite a sobering experience.''
   Under his new schedule, Larson will produce five original panels
a week, with reissues of old cartoons supplied to newspapers to use
during the rest of the week.

   When 6-year-old Sean McQuillan dialed 911, he
thought he had an emergency on his hands. His brother had taken one
of his toys.
   When police arrived at his home after Sean left the phone off
the hook he got a lesson on what the emergency number is for.
   Instead of writing Santa Claus this week, Sean was writing an
apology to ``Mr. Policeman.''
   ``I know you need to catch burglars and help kids who are hurt
or lost or robbed,'' Sean wrote. ``You can't do that if you are at
my house when I don't need you. I am sorry I called you when I did
not need you.''
   A clown had visited Sean's school to introduce children to the
911 emergency system. And the boy figured he'd get to talk to the
clown if he called 911. There was no clown on the line, so he hung
up.
   ``I chewed him out and thought it was the end of it,'' Debbie
McQuillan said Wednesday of her son's first call six months ago.
But last month Sean was at it again while his mother was busy
taking care of her grandmother.
   ``He wanted the policeman to (make his brother) give it back,''
Mrs. McQuillan said of the toy.
   Because Sean left the phone off the hook, police couldn't call
back to check on the situation and an officer was sent to the
McQuillan home.

   Nancy Froelich and Evelyn Kaufman both
have the distinction of having headed the Board of Governors of
State Colleges and Universities _ and they both got their college
degrees this week.
   The women, who had been away from the classroom for a
generation, earned credit for professional experience and added
campus coursework to earn their bachelor of arts degrees from
Eastern Illinois University. They joined more than 500 other EIU
students receiving degrees during fall commencement.
   The women are among 11,500 adult learners in the special Board
of Governors bachelor of arts degree program.
   Mrs. Froelich is chairwoman and Mrs. Kaufman is a member and
former chairwoman of the board, which sets policies for five state
universities in Illinois. But until Sunday, neither had degrees.
   ``I was a little frightened. You think maybe you're not as smart
as you thought you were,'' said Mrs. Kaufman, a 73-year-old civic
leader and former secretary from Chicago with no college
experience. ``But, I did it. I saw a dream fulfilled.''
   Mrs. Froelich, 59, who lives north of Bloomington in McLean
County, said she quit college in 1950 to marry.
   ``One of the things that has always bothered me is that I didn't
finish,'' she said. As for going back to school, she said, ``The
best part was finding out I could really compete in today's
academic world.''

<HEAD>Unprecedented Shevardnadze Visit Planned to NATO</HEAD>

   NATO foreign ministers said Thursday
that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze would make an
unprecedented visit to the alliance's headquarters next week.
   Shevardnadze's request for a meeting next week at the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization overshadowed the opening day of talks
at which U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III called for a
larger political role for the alliance.
   Baker called Shevardnadze's visit ``a good thing'' and said,
``It's very natural in light of the changes that are taking place
and continuing to take place.''
   It would be the first visit by a Soviet foreign minister to the
headquarters of the Western military alliance, a sign of the
remarkable events unfolding in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   ``This is a beautiful symbol of the growing cooperation between
what can no longer be called the two (military) blocs but let's say
East and West,'' said Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens, whose
government was instrumental in arranging the visit.
   Shevardnadze already was scheduled to be in Brussels on Monday
and Tuesday to sign a new trade and economic cooperation agreement
with the 12-nation European Community. The accord will expand
commercial ties between Moscow and prosperous Western Europe.
   NATO spokesman Robin Stafford said officials were trying to
arrange a meeting between Shevardnadze and NATO Secretary-General
Manfred Woerner.
   Shevardnadze also was expected to meet informally with the
ambassadors of all 16 NATO nations.
   A senior Canadian official suggested the Soviet official's visit
might be more of a courtesy call.
   ``I really don't expect it will be a deeply substantive meeting
because it's not what the Soviets are looking for,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They are not
planning to negotiate with NATO.''
   The Western foreign ministers began their talks by agreeing to
submit a draft arms control treaty to Warsaw Pact negotiators in
Vienna.
   NATO negotiators then placed the draft on the bargaining table
in Vienna, several hours after the Warsaw Pact offered its plan.
   The alliances presented the texts as part of efforts to reach a
speedy agreement. NATO wants an accord wrapped up in 1990; the
United States is pressing for a June deadline.
   President Bush has called for the United States and the Soviet
Union to reduce their troop levels in Europe to 275,000 on each
side. That would require a cutback of 325,000 in Soviet forces and
30,000 in U.S. troops. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has offered
to go down to 350,000.
   As of June, the International Institute for Strategic Studies
lists 326,400 troops for the United States European Command. As of
June 1989, the Soviets had 565,000 troops outside the Soviet Union.
   
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact have also proposed both sides agree to
equal ceilings in Europe of 20,000 tanks and 28,000 armored troop
carriers.
   The Warsaw Pact draft proposed equal limits of 4,700 on combat
aircraft. NATO earlier proposed a ceiling of 5,700.
   The bargaining is seen as a key part of the Western alliance's
efforts to redefine its role in an era of dramatically reduced
tensions.
   Officials said Baker outlined his plans for a wider political
role for NATO. His plan, unveiled in Berlin on Monday, foresees the
alliance as a permanent monitor of the reductions being discussed
in Vienna and as a mediator of regional conflicts.
   ``It finds a positive resonance,'' said the Canadian official.
``Everybody wants the alliance to be functioning well as a
political consultative body.''
   De Michelis said, ``The evolution of Eastern Europe obviously
creates the necessity of evolution on the Western side.''
   Hurd said he supported ``the main thrust'' of Baker's plan but
he also reminded the ministers of NATO's need to keep its ``robust
defense capability.''
   He said building up the alliance's political role was ``no
substitution for the defense role'' but should be seen ``as a
reinforcement of it.''
   The American effort also is designed to address the possibility
of a reunification of the two Germanys, anchoring it firmly in a
Western political and military alliance.
   The ministers, officials said, were likely to include in their
final statement Friday the same reference to German unity made at a
weekend summit of European Community leaders.
   The leaders gave their strong support to the eventual
reunification of Germany and said it should take place ``peacefully
and democratically.'' They said other European borders must stay in
place to ensure stability at a time of uncertainty.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet legislators trying to break the Communist
Party's grip on power struggled Thursday over whether to declare
themselves a political opposition, a step toward formation of an
alternate party.
   ``We cannot take on ourselves responsibility for what the
leadership is doing now,'' said human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov, a deputy.
   ``It is leading the country to a catastrophe, prolonging the
process of perestroika many years,'' he said.
   The Inter-Regional Deputies Group, which consists of about 400
of the 2,250 members of the Congress of People's Deputies, has been
badly outvoted this week as it tried to raise discussion of the
party's constitutional monopoly on power and a series of key
economic laws.
   Since it was formed in August, the group, made up of some of the
Congress' leading reformers, has been careful to avoid calling
itself an opponent of the Communist Party.
   But historian Yuri Afanasyev told the group during an emotional
three-hour meeting that it was time to change its tactics.
   ``We are against the so-called leading role of the Communist
Party, that is the monopoly on power of the ruling party, leading
the country to an unheard-of disaster,'' Afanasyev said in a
statement to the deputies' meeting in the Kremlin.
   ``We are for a multiparty democratic system,'' the statement
said.
   He said that allowing collective and state farmers to freely
leave their farms with land, buildings and seed was the only way to
stave off ``famine threatening the country.''
   Other East bloc countries, pushed by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, have been swept by political reforms this fall. In
Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland, the Communist
monopoly of power has ended, and Bulgaria's Communist Party has
proposed a multiparty system.
   In related developments Thursday:
   _ Bulgaria's Parliament said it could not repeal the Communist
monopoly on power for another month because of a legal
technicality, prompting the jeers of 50,000 angry Bulgarians in the
square outside. New party chief Petar Mladenov tried to speak but
was shouted down.
   _ Czechoslovaki's new government said negotiations had begun
with Moscow on the withdrawal of 80,000 Soviet troops. About 40,000
people rallied in downtown Prague in support of opposition leader
Vaclav Havel's candidacy for president.
   _ East German reform activists pressured the government into
abolishing the Office for National Security, the hated secret
police agency that tried to suppress their peaceful revolt.
   _ NATO leaders meeting in Brussels disclosed that arrangements
are being made for an unprecedented visit by Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to the organization's headquarters,
another reflection of reduced East-West tensions.
   Several hundred of the Soviet deputies ignored most of the
afternoon session of the Congress, devoted to economic reform
plans, to debate proposals by Afanasyev and several others.
   Many of the deputies who spoke at the meeting questioned
Afanasyev's terminology of a ``political opposition'' that calls
itself the ``radical-democratic bloc.''
   They said that could be used against them by conservatives who
control the Congress, and could hurt them in local elections with a
population that many feel is becoming more conservative because of
severe economic problems.
   They formed a commission to work out a proposal to bring before
a new gathering on Friday.
   ``The people don't want a declaration of a crisis,'' said one
deputy from the Don River coal basin of the eastern Ukraine. ``They
want the crisis to be over, and something to be on the store
shelves.''
   Vladislav Shapovalenko of Orenburg said the reformers could be
accused of further polarizing the Congress. ``The failure of the
session could be blamed on us.''
   Afanasyev, interviewed after the meeting, said that it was
possible that if adopted by the group his proposal could be a step
toward formation of an alternate political party.
   ``My variant is a political opposition to the leadership of the
Communist Party and the leadership of the country,'' Afanasyev said.
   Asked if his proposal could lead to formation of an alternative
to the Communist Party, Afanasyev said it was ``fully possible.''
   But he said the group could also consider itself a faction
within the Communist Party.
   Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, chairman of the meeting,
said he thought the commission should come up with a more moderate
proposal than Afanasyev's.
   On Tuesday, the first day of the session, the Inter-Regional
Deputies Group pressed for a debate on Article 6 of the Soviet
Constitution, which calls the Communist Party the ``leading and
guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political
system.''
   However, they lost on that issue by a vote of 1,138 to 839, and
by a wider margin on their bid to debate legislation on land and
property ownership.

   Members and supporters of the Ku Klux Klan
will rally in a quiet college town in support of two high school
students disciplined for wearing Klan robes to school, police said
Thursday.
   But citizens groups are urging residents to ignore Saturday's
march, 10 times the normal number of police will be on duty and,
based on previous Klan attempts to hold rallies in southwestern
Ohio, officials say the event probably will be a big to-do about
nothing.
   ``Frankly, I think they have gotten far too much publicity over
this,'' City Manager Dennis Stuckey said. ``There is a group in the
community that is actively promoting the shunning of the march. It
may well be that there are more media than there are marchers and
spectators.''
   Klansman Ernie Edwards of Morrow received a city permit for the
gathering, telling police 500 people would participate.
   Saturday's rally follows an incident in which two students
showed up at Oxford's Talawanda High School on Halloween in Klan
robes and shouted racial epithets. Blacks held an
anti-discrimination march the following week.
   Edwards, who told police he represented a group called U.S.
Knights, has not been available for comment; a woman who answered
his phone hung up on a reporter.
   The Klan march will start and end at the high school, where
about 50 of the 1,100 students are black.
   But Edwards was told his group would have to march on sidewalks
unless enough marchers show up to make it worthwhile to close city
streets.
   ``We don't want to inconvenience a lot of people for a few
(marchers),'' said Lt. Dick McVey, acting chief of police in the
town northwest of Cincinnati.
   ``I don't know what to expect, whether curiosity-seekers will
come out to look at these individuals, and that's one of our
concerns. Our plan is tobe prepared for the worst.''
   McVey will have 35 officers in the two-block-square march area,
including several county and township officers. Three or four
officers patrol Oxford on a typical Saturday.
   ``They say they'll have 500 people,'' McVey said. ``I warned
them that if not the expected number show up, I might encourage the
city attorney to seek payment for all these officers.''
   Oxford, home of Miami University, has a population of about
20,000 people, McVey said; 94.2 percent are white.
   ``I have personal feelings and official opinions about this,''
Stuckey said. ``My official position is that they have as much
right to congregate as anyone does. We work with all kinds of
groups because of the nature of the community. I guess it's more
routine for us ... to have activities of this nature.''
   Police departments say there probably are no more than 25 KKK
members in the area, but that it doesn't take many to stir things
up.
   The Green Ribbon Committee of Oxford was formed in response to
Saturday's march. It adopted green ribbons as a symbol of anti-Klan
sentiment and has been tying ribbons to trees and utility poles in
town to protest the march, which it wants residents to boycott.

   The Justice Department is investigating
whether some airlines violated antitrust laws when they increased
fares earlier this year, department and industry officials said
Thursday.
   The department's antitrust division has asked several airlines
to submit information about how they determine fares, including an
correspondence between carriers about an increase that took effect
Sept. 29, airline officials said.
   Several airlines increased fares on some routes between $10 and
$80, depending on how many days before departure tickets are
purchased.
   An antitrust expert who spoke on condition on anonymity said the
government was probably examining the industry's practice of
reporting fare increases before they take effect.
   Under this theory of antitrust violation, the pre-publication of
fare increases to travel agents and an industry clearinghouse
called the Airline Tariff Publishers Inc. would be viewed as a
``facilitating device'' for price fixing, the expert said.
   While ``it would be difficult to prove an agreement'' among
airlines to raise fares, the Justice Department might try to show
that the pre-publication of fares is way to signal price increases,
this expert said.
   An airline would ``run a price up the flagpole. If everybody
salutes it, it goes into effect,'' the expert said. If no one
follows suit, the airline is free to cancel the planned increase.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said civil
investigative demands were sent to ``a number of carriers within a
short period of time after the Sept. 29 effective date.''
   She declined to say which airlines received the orders or to
give details of the inquiry.
   ``We have complied with requests for information, but we really
don't see any basis for the investigation,'' said David Messing,
spokesman for Continental Airlines.
   Delta, Northwest and American, which was the first to indicate
it was raising fares, also acknowledged receiving requests for
information.
   Three other airlines that the Wall Street Journal reported were
subject to investigation _ USAir, United and Trans World _ declined
comment.
   The public affairs department at Pan American, also cited in the
Journal report, said no spokesman was immediately available.
   Jim Lundy of Delta said the Justice Department asked for any
correspondence between Delta and other airlines over fares.
   ``There was none,'' he said.
   The order also asked for information about the airline's
ticket-pricing operations and the way it makes decisions on fares,
along with the process used in determining the Sept. 29 increase.
   When an airline files a fare increase, it appears in a
ticket-pricing database available to all carriers, and in the
computer reservations systems used by travel agents.
   ``No one can really afford to be at a competitive disadvantage
for more than a few hours,'' Lundy said. ``You have to move very
quickly.''
   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said the company ran an analysis
of its Sept. 29 fare increase after the government inquiry and
determined that ``we followed standard procedures.''
   He said once a fare increase is filed electronically, each
carrier has to decide whether to reduce, increase or maintain its
fare on each competitive route.
   Airlines say that pre-publication of fares is necessary to
enable the public to plan in advance.
   If the government can prove its case, it might be able to obtain
an injunction either to stop the pre-publication of air fares or
some change in procedures to prevent airlines from signaling their
increases.

   Anti-smoking efforts need to target younger
people who have relatively little schooling because the use of
cigarettes drops sharply among the better-educated, federal health
researchers said Thursday.
   A Centers for Disease Control study said that while other
factors may influence smoking, education is an increasingly
important one.
   A 1988 behavioral risk factor survey of 36 states and the
District of Columbia found that the less-educated, who also tend to
be of a lower social and economic status, are more likely to be
smokers than are others.
   ``There has been progress in reducing cigarette smoking,'' said
Dr. Luis Escobedo of the Atlanta-based CDC, who analyzed aspects of
the survey.
   ``But the study shows most of the progress is limited to the
well-educated,'' he said.
   Escobedo said the National Cancer Institute has a program in
inner-city schools working to reduce the odds of children becoming
regular smokers, and private institutes and some state health
departments do the same.
   Results, based on a random telephone survey of 19,822 people 18
years of age or older, showed that for people over 35 the
likelihood of being a current smoker increased with each decrease
in the level of education.
   However, for those age 18 to 34, the chance of being a current
smoker decreased substantially only for those with more than a high
school education, while smoking rates for high school dropouts and
high school graduates were more nearly equal.
   The study said cultural factors also may affect who smokes. For
example, Utah, which has a high population of Mormons, whose church
opposes smoking, had the lowest rate of smokers, 18.1 percent, and
former smokers, 9.1 percent.
   Kentucky, a tobacco-growing state, had the highest percentage of
current smokers at 37.9 percent. The highest percentage of former
smokers was in Maine, 20.3 percent.
   The median figure for current smokers was 26.2 percent, meaning
that half the states were above that figure and half below. The
median figure for former smokers was 15.1 percent.
   The study said other factors affecting who smokes include school
anti-smoking programs, state cigarette taxes and the intensity of
promotional events and advertising by the tobacco industry.
   The survey was part of a study done annually since 1980 with
more states participating each year, he said.

   About 300,000 southern Sudanese face
starvation because renewed fighting between government and rebels
has suspended relief operations in the region, a Western official
said Thursday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said food
stocks at the southern capital of Juba were expected to run out in
a week.
   He said a new international operation to send about 90,000
metric tons of relief food to southern Sudan in January is
paralyzed until the government allows resumption of flights
carrying aid to the south.
   The U.N. representative to Sudan, Michael Bristly, left Khartoum
on Wednesday for a meeting with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez
de Cuellar to ``see what he can do to get things moving,'' the
official said.
   ``Some 300,000 persons in the south will face famine because
both the rebel SPLA (Sudan People's Liberation Army) and the
Sudanese government are reluctant to allow the safe passage of
relief to the needy people in the south of Sudan,'' the official
told The Associated Press.
   ``If people are to be saved and a repetition of the 1988 plague
is to be avoided, food has to be taken to these people as urgently
as possible,'' he said.
   Some Western relief officials believe more than 560,000 people
died in 1988 from starvation or fighting in the south. The United
Nations believes the figure is closer to 250,000. The entire
country has a population of about 25 million.
   The relief official interviewed Thursday said the 90,000
additional tons of food must be in place in the south before March,
when heavy rains make many roads and airstrips unusable.
   The southerners are victims of a manmade famine. Fighting in the
southern countryside of this East African country has driven more
than 2 million people from farms and homes since the rebels began
their battle for more autonomy in 1983. The refugees fled either
toward a handful of government-held southern towns and became
dependent of relief, or they trekked north to Khartoum.
   In April, a cease-fire allowed the U.N.-coordinated operation
``Lifeline Sudan'' to send about 70,000 tons of food into southern
Sudan. The relief prevented a repeat of the 1988 disaster,
officials say.
   But relief flights into the south have been suspended by the
government since October after the renewed fighting. The government
said the suspension of flights was ``for the safety and security of
the relief personnel.''
   The Western relief official said Juba, capital of the southern
Eqatoria region 775 miles south of Khartoum, already faces a food
shortage.
   ``Maize has become as precious as gold, and there will be no
(relief) grain or wheat or sorghum in Juba at the end of this
month'' the official said.
   There are about 300,000 people in the city. More than half are
southern refugees.
   Western doners have asked the government to hold a conference
with them on Jan. 25 to discuss the food needs of the south.
   On Wednesday, the Sudan News Agency quoted Social Welfare
Undersecretary Ibrahim Abu-Ouf as saying the government was
considering the idea.

<HEAD>Defense Consultant Convicted Of Funneling Bribes</HEAD>

   Defense consultant Thomas E. Muldoon was
convicted Thursday of charges that he helped a defense firm funnel
bribes to a Marine Corps contracting official for help getting
Pentagon contracts.
   Muldoon, 59, was convicted of eight charges by a federal court
jury in Alexandria, Va., that acquitted a former executive of
Whittaker Corp. of all charges that he participated in the bribery
scheme.
   Jurors deliberated more than six hours before convicting Muldoon
of bribery, conspiracy and interstate travel in aid of the
commission of a felony.
   The jury acquitted Leonard L. Ingram, the former Whittaker
executive, of all nine charges against him.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton scheduled Muldoon's
sentencing for Feb. 16. He could be sentenced up to 70 years in
prison and fined more than $1 million.
   Muldoon, described by prosecutors as an important figure in the
Pentagon procurement scandal, was found guilty of participating in
a scheme to funnel bribes to Jack A. Sherman, a former Marine Corps
civilian contracting supervisor.
   The scandal is at the heart of a multi-year investigation by
government agents, who code-named their operation ``Ill Wind.''
   Sherman, who pleaded guilty to other bribery charges, testified
that he solicted more than $80,000 from Lee Telecommunications,
which was taken over by Whittaker in 1986, in return for helping
the company get electronics contracts.
   Sherman testified that he agreed to split payments from Lee with
Muldoon and two other defense consultants.
   During the trial he recalled receiving about $25,000 from
Muldoon, who served as a conduit between Lee and Sherman. Muldoon
took a two-thirds share of what Lee paid them, Sherman said.
   Muldoon called no witnesses on his behalf during the trial,
which began Monday.
   Ingram, 51, a retired Marine Corps major who now lives in
Huntsville, Ala., testified that he opposed the company's scheme to
bribe Sherman.
   Ingram was he was told by another company official, Scott
Lamberth to mind his own business.
   Ingram, who was a stockholder and vice president of Lee, became
a vice president of Whittaker Command and Control Systems after the
1986 takeover.
   ``Ill Wind blew itself out,'' Ingram's lawyer, Marcus Topel said
after the verdict. ``In their zeal to broaden this investigation,
(prosecutors) put too much reliance on the credibility of their
informants.''
   Topel said Sherman ``is probably the sleaziest witness and
probably one of the most disreputable persons I've seen in my
career.''
   The Whittaker subsidiary pleaded guilty to participating in the
bribery scheme and paid $3.5 million in fines and penalties.
Lamberth and another former executive of Lee-Whittaker, John
Franklin Van Tassel also pleaded guilty guilty.
   They both testified at the trial and were scheduled to be
sentenced Friday by Hilton.

   Reform activists scored another victory for
democracy Thursday by pressuring the government into abolishing the
hated secret police agency that tried to suppress their peaceful
revolt.
   The decision to shut down the Office for National Security came
out of negotiations between Communist leaders and opposition
groups, and amid increasing threats against secret police officials
by citizens angry about previous excesses.
   The Interior Ministry said threats and attacks against secret
police have increased at an ``alarming rate,'' and warned East
Germans against trying to take the law into their own hands.
   The official East German news agency ADN said government
officials, police and reform activists met late Thursday to discuss
how to keep the peace in East Berlin. ADN said the ``discussion
partners'' asked citizens to act responsibly.
   The capital appeared calm and the rain-soaked central streets
were nearly deserted after businesses closed. But violent incidents
have been reported in other major cities.
   More than 10,000 demonstrators braved bad weather in Erfurt to
push for reforms and warn against selling out to West Germany. But
ADN said banners supporting reunification were ``unmissable.''
   Also Thursday, West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann
met with Communist Premier Hans Modrow and the two sides agreed to
set up a joint economic commission and broaden cooperation.
   Haussmann said more than 40 percent of West Germany's booming
industries have expressed interest in expanding their businesses
into a reformed East German economy.
   The Soviet Union's chief ideologist, Politburo member Alexander
Yakovlev, came to East Berlin late Thursday for a meeting with
Communist Party chief Gregor Gysi before this weekend's important
party congress.
   The East German party is trying to restructure itself into a
movement for ``democratic socialism,'' to win public trust and a
chance at a role in government after next spring's free elections.
   The Interior Ministry said posters have appeared on factory
walls calling Communist Party and secret police officials
``traitors who deserve the death penalty.''
   In Dresden, about 50 people dragged one man out of his car and
tied a towing cable around his neck, shouting: ``Communist swine,
we'll hang you!'' the ministry reported in a statement carried by
ADN.
   A lynching was prevented by a man who managed to bring the crowd
under control, the report said.
   Elke Guenther of New Forum, the largest of East Germany's
pro-democracy groups, praised the dissolution of the ``Stasi''
secret police as a concession that may ease tension.
   Ms. Guenther said the secret police harassed leaders of the
reform movement until weeks ago, when the swelling force for change
forced the ouster of Erich Honecker's 18-year, hard-line leadership
and burst open the door to the West.
   The State Security Ministry already had been downgraded to the
National Security Agency and about 10,000 agents had been sent to
work in industry.
   Dozens of soldiers stood guard around secret police headquarters
in East Berlin after the decision to shut down the service was
disclosed.
   A spokesman in the press office of the security agency said the
government would divide the agency's responsibilites among other
ministries.
   ``This decision is another consequence of the round-table
talks,'' government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said at a news
conference.
   Communist Party officials last week opened talks with
representatives of rival political parties and fledgling pro-reform
movements to discuss the nation's future. The first session agreed
on a May 6, 1990, date for the nation's first free elections.
   The secret police apparatus was a major target of opposition
criticism. Angry citizens took over secret police headquarters in
Leipzig, Gera and other cities to prevent destruction of evidence
against officials accused of corruption.
   Honecker is among those accused of having misused their offices
and indulged in high living as the national economy stagnated.
   Meyer said the Wandlitz settlement where former leaders have
been under house arrest will be converted to a rehabilitation
center for handicapped children by February.
   At talks on making Western investment in East Germany more
secure and attractive, Haussmann laid out a plan that calls for
measures to protect the assets of foreign investors and ease
restrictions that discourage joint ventures.
   Haussmann said after his meetings with Modrow and East Germany's
economics minister, Christa Luft, that he considered an agreement
on Western investment protection to be essential by February.
   Ms. Luft said seven major industrial complexes will be operating
on a self-financing and independent basis as an experiment in
broadening the rights and responsibilities of East German
enterprises.

<HEAD>Palestinian Guerrillas Attack Syrian Military Base, 13 Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian guerrillas attacked a Syrian
base in south Lebanon Thursday and freed 15 detained comrades in a
two-hour foray in which at least 13 people were killed, police
reported.
   Syrians troops and armor massed along the Awali River, on the
northern edge of Sidon, apparently preparing for a retaliatory
strike across the line beyond which Israel has said it will not
tolerate Syrian military presence.
   A group calling itself the Organization for the Defense of the
Oppressed threatened to kill Pope John Paul II, claiming he
supports the Lebanese Christian military leader, Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Aoun refuses to bow to a new Christian-Moslem government trying
to end the 14-year-old sectarian war, and has pledged to drive the
Syrians out of Lebanon.
   Thursday's statement was the second threat by the group against
the pope. The first, in August, said he would be killed if he
visited Lebanon.
   Police said about 150 fighters from Fatah, the mainstream
guerrilla faction led by Yasser Arafat, chairman of Palestine
Liberation Organization, stormed and ransacked the Syrian military
intelligence headquarters for south Lebanon.
   Bullet scars and smoke-blackened shell pocks dotted the
three-story headquarters. The blown-off tin roof of a fruit stall
lay next to the building and hundreds of oranges, apparently
spilled during the attack, covered the alleyway.
   The fighters, based in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp in Sidon,
traveled 3 miles north and crossed the Awali River to raid the base
on the coastal highway. The river is 40 miles north of the Israeli
border and 25 south of Beirut.
   The guerrillas used jeep-mounted 107mm recoilless guns,
shoulder-fired rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47 assault rifles,
said police and Palestinian sources in Sidon.
   A statement from PLO headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, did not
deny Fatah's involvement, but condemned the attack.
   ``It is incumbent on the Palestinian leadership to reaffirm that
it condemns totally such acts and that it immediately gave
instructions for the opening of an investigation in collaboration
with the forces present in Sidon ... to identify the authors and
commanders of this attack,'' it said.
   A police source said privately the raid might have been planned
and executed, without Arafat's prior consent, by local Fatah
commanders seeking the release of their comrades.
   ``We can't rule out this possibility, since the Fatah commanders
had blamed the chain of assassinations and assassination attempts
against them in Sidon this year on Syria's military intelligence,''
the source said.
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 with the stated purpose of
driving out Arafat's guerrillas, and warned Syria when it withdrew
in 1985 not to venture south of the Awali.
   Arafat has been at loggerheads with Syrian President Hafez Assad
since a Syrian-backed mutiny in PLO ranks in 1983.
   More than 2,000 Palestinian guerrillas remain in Syrian jails.
They were arrested in 1983 during an offensive by militias allied
with Syria that forced Arafat loyalists to evacuate Tripoli, a port
in north Lebanon. Arafat had set up his command there after the
Israelis captured Beirut.
   The police spokesman said 15 Palestinians, all from Fatah, were
set free during the raid and taken back to Ein el-Hilweh. They were
among 43 people wounded in the attack, police said.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate. It never discloses casualties, but Lebanese
police said the dead included four Syrians, including a major, and
five attackers.
   Also killed were a Communist Party fighter and three militiamen
of the leftist Nasserite Organization, the Sunni Moslem group that
has controlled Sidon since the civil war began in 1975, who manned
a checkpoint on the Awali bridge.

<TEXT>
   A leader of West Germany's Jewish community
who died last year embezzled nearly $16 million in government funds
intended for Holocaust survivors, according to a report released
Thursday.
   The report, prepared by federal officials and Jewish officials,
added that attempts to get the money back have been unsuccessful.
   After the January 1988 death of Werner Nachmann, the 62-year-old
chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, investigators
found he had run a massive embezzlement scheme involving
reparations paid by the West German government.
   It is the largest scandal to hit West Germany's Jewish community
and led to calls for greater supervision of governmental funds
intended as reparations for Jewish survivors of the Nazi terror.
   Investigators found that Nachmann, as the supervisor of the bank
accounts where the money was kept, had been routinely skimming off
the interest for his own use.
   The Council has sued a bank, which the report did not identify,
to try to get the money back; other attempts to recover it have
been unsuccessful, according to the report.
   Most of the money went into a failing textile business and other
firms Nachmann ran, and at one point the Council threatened to
bring charges against his family and co-workers to get it back.
   However, Thursday's final report said there were no grounds for
criminal charges against any other people. Most of the embezzlement
took place between 1981 and 1987, and the scandal also led to the
resignation of the Council's general secretary in July 1988.
   ``The embezzlement is based on the one side on Nachmann's
criminal actions and on the other on a lack of oversight,'' said
the report released by Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and
Nachmann's successor, Heinz Galinski.
   Galinski said in July 1988 the affair had inflicted ``the worst
damage'' on the West German Jewish community, which now numbers
about 36,000 people. About 530,000 Jews lived in Germany when the
Nazis took power in 1933.
   Galinski also has said the federal government in Bonn should
have played a more active role in supervising the fund, which
totaled $210 million.
   Overall, West Germany has paid more than $43 billion in various
forms of reparations to survivors of the Holocaust and their
families. About 6 million European Jews were killed in the genocide.

<HEAD>Priest Denies Allegations by Male Prostitute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest accused of sexual and
financial misconduct by a male prostitute who once stayed at the
priest's home for runaways denied the charges Thursday and called
them ``deeply offensive.''
   ``I categorically deny these allegations,'' the Rev. Bruce
Ritter said at a crowded news conference in the Covenent House
cafeteria. He said the charges were ``deeply offensive to me'' and
had seriously harmed the image of the 20-year-old, nationally
recognized organization that runs shelters in seven North American
cities and four Central American nations.
   The Manhattan district attorney is investigating charges of
financial improprieties by Ritter, charges made by a 20-year-old
man who also reportedly claimed he had a sexual relationship with
the 62-year-old Franciscan priest.
   Ritter firmly disputed the charges. He said he served as a
special mentor to the man, who nonetheless later lapsed into his
previous life of prostitution.
   Ritter's Covenant House opened in 1969 after six teens showed up
at his apartment looking for a place to stay. The organization now
has more than 1,500 beds and serves about 25,000 children annually.
More than 90 percent of its funding is private.
   Ritter's group was one of 18 honored by President Bush in April
as winners of Ronald Reagan Awards for Volunteer Excellence.
   Ritter said the young man at the center of the dispute was one
of a group of runaway prostitutes who say they are being pursued by
organized crime members who run prostitution rings. They are given
special attention and a personal mentor.
   ``I chose to become his mentor because, frankly, I had more
experience than anyone else,'' Ritter said.
   ``We tried so very hard, and we failed,'' he said. ``It is
probably better to say that I failed. ... I thought I knew more
than I did.''
   Asked why the man would have accused him of such transgressions,
Ritter replied, ``I honestly, simply do not know.''
   He said he last spoke with the man in early November and that he
had chastised him for falling back into prostitution. There was
``definitely a cooling-off of the relationship.''
   Ritter and the authorities have not identified the man, but a
law enforcement source identified him for The Associated Press as
Timothy Warner.
   Ritter produced a memo that he said detailed all the money
Covenant House spent on the man _ $9,800, not $25,000 as reported.
The organization, which has an annual budget of $85 million for its
various shelters, spends an average of $15,000 per person, he said.
   An audit, he said, ``found our books in perfect order. Every
penny is accounted for.''
   The man was treated like other runaways who claim their lives
are in danger from organized crime, he said.
   He stayed at Covenant House's crisis unit, then was set up in an
apartment staffed by Covenant House personnel. Staff members took
him to their homes on special occasions, and Ritter acknowledged
traveling with him a few times, but said there were no sexual
relations.
   ``We provide for these kids a new identity and education
necessary for survival. Their needs are enormous,'' he said. ``They
are almost always boys. They are bereft of family and friends. They
are terrified. They are incapable of trust.''
   The New York Post reported Wednesday that investigators had the
youth wear a recording device during a conversation with Ritter to
try to confirm allegations that they had a sexual relationship.
   Ritter said he was unaware of any taping, though he acknowledged
the conversation ``got a little weird, a little inconsistent.''
   The Post reported that during the taped conversation, Ritter
said, ``I decided a long time ago that if God doesn't like me the
way I am, then that's his problem.''
   Ritter said Thursday that he remembered telling the man, who was
distressed about sliding back into prostitution, that sometimes
``we are what we are.''

   Czechoslovakia's foreign minister says his
country plans to review relations with Israel, indicating a renewal
of diplomatic ties is near, Israel Television reported Thursday.
   The television also quoted Jiri Dienstbier as telling reporters
in Prague the Middle East conflict should be solved by dialogue.
The television saw that comment as another indication of
Czechoslovakia's plans to revive its ties with the Jewish state.
   All the Eastern bloc countries except Romania cut diplomatic
relations with Israel following the 1967 Middle East war. Hungary,
which is also in the grip of democratic changes, was the first to
renew full diplomatic relations in September.
   The Soviet Union and Poland have renewed low-level diplomatic
relations with Israel in the last three years.
   Israel's representative in Poland, Mordechai Paltzur, returned
to Warsaw this week after a visit to Czechoslovakia.
   He said that ``foreign ministry professionals there have long
thought that some ties with Israel should be reestablished, maybe
not full relations, but some type of ties.''
   ``But the politicians were stony _ Stalinist _ and these
suggestions were not accepted,'' he said in a telephone interview
with Israel Television.
   Czechoslovakia, which is undergoing a wave of democratic reform,
this week installed a government with a non-Communist majority.
   Paltzur said that during the visit to Prague, he discussed such
issues as tourism, cultural and economic ties, and possible air
links between the two countries.
   ``When ties are renewed, they would want to sign agreements on
these subjects,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Awarded $43.2 Million for Car Fire That Killed Family</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman whose family burned to death in a 1982
car fire has won a $43.2 million judgment against Toyota, the
largest award ever entered against the company.
   Jurors in a state district court awarded $18.2 million in actual
damages and $25 million in exemplary damages Wednesday to Nike
Adegbite, 36, who watched while her husband and two daughters died
in the burning car six years ago. Two other people also died in the
fire.
   Ms. Adegbite escaped serious injury in the accident involving a
1973 Toyota Corona station wagon, which caught fire after being
rear-ended on a Houston highway.
   Lawyers on both sides expressed surprise at the size of the
judgment against Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. and its parent
company, Toyota Motor Corp.
   ``We were of course surprised at the verdict _ not only by the
extraordinary amount, but that the jury decided against us,'' said
Douglas West, vice president and general counsel for Toyota Motor
Sales in Torrance, Calif.
   Ms. Adegbite was surprised, too, said her lawyer, Stan Pfeiffer.
   ``I think everybody was (shocked). It was an emotional moment,''
he added.
   West said the verdict ``is the highest award against Toyota by a
very wide margin.'' Previously, the largest award against Toyota
was about $5 million, he said.
   West said Toyota will ask the judge to set aside the verdict. If
he doesn't, the company plans to appeal.
   Neither West nor Pfeiffer believed the award was the largest
ever entered against an automobile sales company or manufacturer.
   Pfeiffer said the Sept. 26, 1982, accident happened when the
driver of the car, Boyo Adetoye, tried to steer off a roadway
because he had a flat tire, and his car was struck by a van.
   The impact pushed the station wagon's fuel tank forward,
Pfeiffer said, and the tank was punctured by an empty spare tire
carrier and a valve on the rear axle.
   ``Upon impact, the Toyota burst into flames when the gasoline
tank was punctured. Nike escaped to watch her husband and her two
girls burn to death,'' he said.
   Adetoye suffered minor injuries, but his wife and child also
died. He reached a settlement with Toyota; the amount has not been
disclosed.
   Pfeiffer claimed that if the spare tire had been in place, it
would have acted as a cushion for the fuel tank and prevented the
fire. He argued that Toyota had an obligation to tell buyers that
the tire must be in place as protection against rear-end impacts.
   But West said the missing spare tire played no part in the fire.
   Pfeiffer said the jury found that the design was defective and
that Toyota negligently designed the vehicle and failed to recall
it.
   Toyota denies any defects or negligence in the vehicle's design,
West said.
   Sam Cole, a researcher with the Center for Auto Safety, a
non-profit consumer group in Washington, said Thursday that there
were problems with the design of gas tanks on 1966-73 Corona models.
   He said the tanks were too close to the rear and had no
significant structure to absorb the impact of a crash.
   ``You're driving a time bomb if someone hits you from behind,''
he said.
   At least 17 people have died in fiery accidents involving the
1966-73 Corona models, Cole added. He did not have any specific
information concerning problems with the tanks when the spare isn't
in place in 1973 station wagons.
   Toyota improved Corona gas tanks after 1973, he said. The model
eventually was phased out.

   Immigration Commissioner Gene McNary said
Thursday he was studying a plan to bar Central Americans from
working in overloaded labor markets such as Miami and San Diego
while seeking political asylum.
   Under the plan being reviewed by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, work permits issued to aliens applying for
political asylum would restrict them from taking jobs in cities
where there is a glut of cheap labor caused by a large
concentration of new arrivals.
   The work permits ``may exclude Miami or San Diego or areas that
are overrun at the present time'' by aliens, McNary said.
   In Miami alone there are 50,000 people, mostly Central
Americans, seeking refugee status. The large concentration of
would-be refugees places a strain on the local labor market and on
community social services.
   McNary said he has asked the INS general counsel to review
whether the agency has legal authority to place such restrictions
on work permits granted to people who are applying for political
asylum.
   Arthur Helton, director of the Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights' refugee project, said restricting work permits would be an
unlawful travel restriction under the Constitution and the United
Nations refugee protocol.
   Helton said ``the only humane solution'' is to spend more money
to hire more INS examiners to speed up the processing. Delays of
months and years only encourages people to apply for work permits,
he said.
   The new immigration commissioner, who took office Oct. 26,
acknowledged in an interview with reporters that, ``I don't feel as
though I have control'' of the sprawling agency that has been
criticized for mismanagement.
   Some decisions have been made without approval of headquarters
but ``will be brought under our management,'' McNary said.
   Under McNary's predecessor, Alan Nelson, INS came under repeated
criticism for mismanagement and inefficiency. An audit ordered by
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh sharply criticized the management
of the agency under Nelson.
   While being careful not to criticize Nelson, McNary said: ``I am
aware of a number of audits that have been conducted and are
ongoing. I view that as a benefit.''
   The commissioner said he has taken steps to centralize the
agency's budget, procurement, hiring and policy development.
   The lines of authority must be clarified because ``we have
people who are taking orders from two different sources,'' McNary
said.
   Because of the diversity of statements by INS officials around
the country, McNary said he had ``found myself at a loss as to what
the policy was'' on certain issues.
   ``There is going to be one policy and it's going to be
established here at the central office,'' said McNary, who last
month ordered INS officials to clear public statements with
Washington.
   The new commissioner said he wants to streamline deportation
proceedings, which often take years to complete because of
cumbersome administrative appeals.
   ``The way INS handles deportation is absurd,'' he said. ``Any
lawyer can kick a case for years.''
   McNary said he needed more time to determine whether INS would
continue to deport Nicaraguans who came to this country.
   About 70 were deported last spring after a crackdown on the
Texas-Mexico border. During an eight-month period, as many as
60,000 Central Americans entered this country.
   Nicaraguans have enjoyed a special status in the sense that any
INS deportation order is reviewed by a special Justice Department
unit set up during the Reagan administration.
   McNary also said he plans to issue new regulations for
determining if an alien has a well-founded fear of persecution and
is therefore eligible for political asylum.
   ``Our adjudicators don't have the training they should have, as
a result there may be mistakes made,'' McNary said.
   McNary said he had no plans to change the INS policy of
interviewing Haitians on Coast Guard cutters that intercept boat
loads of people headed toward U.S. shores.
   McNary said he would not consider conducting the processing of
these Haitians on U.S. soil because that would mean ``crossing the
line of exclusion to deportation and deportation is a major
problem.''
   The Coast Guard intercepts one or two boatloads of Haitians a
month on the high seas. Those refused political asylum by INS
inspectors are turned back to their native land, a practice that
has been criticized by groups favoring a more open immigration
policy for Haitians.

<HEAD>City Nativity Scene Finds Home _ in Monkey House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city-sponsored Nativity scene
sanctioned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1984 has a new home, but
neither religious nor civil liberties activists are happy with the
location _ a monkey house at the zoo.
   Mayor Brian J. Sarault pledged last week to find a new place for
the creche after a councilman called the mayor a ``grinch'' and
residents complained that the city had not planned to display the
figures.
   The Nativity scene was not going to be displayed because the
lawns at City Hall and Hodgson Park, where it usually stood, were
under repair, officials said.
   The new display, depicting the birth of Jesus, was erected at
the Slater Park Zoo monkey house this week. The city spent about
$900 to replace the scene, which was badly in need of repair.
   But placing the creche in the foyer of the monkey house is
``ludicrous'' and ``makes a mockery'' of a sacred religious symbol,
said the Rev. Thomas E. Ahlburn at the First Unitarian Church in
Providence, a critic of government-sponsored creches.
   ``I just hope the monkeys appreciate it,'' he said.
   Steven Brown, local director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, said it was ``another clear example of why the government
should stick to the business of governing and let private citizens
and churches sponsor religious symbols and treat them the way they
should be treated.''
   ``Using Jesus Christ to promote a zoo may be a good Madison
Avenue technique. I'm not sure it does a good job or promoting the
sanctity of the creche,'' Brown said.
   In 1980, the ACLU challenged Pawtucket's right to put a Nativity
scene on public property. In a widely cited decision, the Supreme
Court ruled 5-4 that the scene could be erected because it
contained secular elements, such as Santa's reindeer, a wishing
well and candy canes.
   Paul Savoie, the mayor's administrative assistant, said the zoo
location was only temporary because of the construction, but he
defended it as appropriate.
   ``As a Catholic myself, I have to say that if Jesus were born in
a manger in a stable, I certainly don't think he would have any
problem with it,'' Savoie said.

   Up to 50,000 of Bulgaria's newly vocal
citizens jeered and whistled in the square outside when Parliament
decided Thursday it could not legally repeal the Communist monopoly
on power for another month.
   New party chief Petar Mladenov, who has promised reform, tried
to address the crowd later and was shouted down.
   ``We will do our best to meet the demands of the people for
democracy!'' he called out. The crowd responded, ``We don't want
you!''
   He shouted back: ``We want to assure you of our responsibility
for the fate of Bulgaria, that we all want democracy! If you do not
believe us, this could lead us to tragedy!''
   The crowd's answer: ``Resign! Resign!''
   About half the crowd in the square had heeded a call to disperse
from Zheliu Zhelev, an opposition leader, by the time Mladenov and
other officials emerged from the building.
   Zhelev asked the crowd to return on Friday.
   ``We'll be here!'' they shouted.
   Parliament later issued a declaration, rejecting ``all attempts
to pressure its decision-making process by undemocratic means,''
the state news agency BTA reported.
   The statement said the protesters showed ``political vulgarity
and intolerance'' and intended to ``bring disunity to the nation
and to cause destablization.''
   Mladenov rose to power when Todor Zhivkov, who ran a Stalinist
state for 35 years, was forced out Nov. 10. He has promised
dialogue with independent groups and free elections by May.
   On Wednesday the policy-making Central Committee voted to
relinquish the party's leading role, as parties elsewhere in
Eastern Europe have done.
   Parliament approved a Communist Party motion Thursday to discuss
removing Article 1 of the constitution, which guarantees party
supremacy, but members said action could not be taken immediately.
   Stanko Todorov, the speaker, said the constitution requires that
any motion to change must be voted upon between one and three
months after it is made.
   While members deliberated inside, the crowd chanted ``We are
here!'' and ``Come out! Come out!'' Some formed a human chain
around the building.
   More protesters arrived. Deputy speaker Atanas Dimitrov went out
and accepted a resolution from Zhelev outlining demands for reform:
abolition of the party's lock on power, talks with the opposition
and free elections.
   It was the same manifesto approved Sunday at a cheering,
snow-swept rally of 50,000 people in the heart of Sofia.
   At the three-day meeting that ended Wednesday, the Central
Committee accepted the essence of the demands.
   Alexander Dimitrov, a parliamentary deputy, challenged the
decision to postpone a vote on the party monopoly.
   ``If we are talking about a democratic society, (people will)
ask what we are about if we don't cancel Article 1,'' he said. ``If
our electorate outside is to respect us, the first step is to
cancel Article 1.''
   Dozens of deputies took the floor, a new experience in a chamber
where hands had been raised automatically for so many years to
approve Zhivkov's orders.
   Membership changes also are on Parliament's agenda, which means
Zhivkov, his son, Vladmir, and Milko Balev, a close associate,
probably will lose their seats. The party expelled them Wednesday.
   Members also are to consider removing clauses on anti-state
activity from the penal code and passing new laws on assembly and
association.
   After the agenda was adopted Thursday, speaker Todorov declared
the assembly should end its practice of voting unanimously by show
of hands. ``Voting without thinking'' had been harmful, he said..
   ``The people ... require us to do something,'' Todorov told the
legislators. ``Questions cannot be resolved from above. .... Power
means responsibility.''
   A taste of democracy was not the only thing on the crowd's mind
Thursday.
   Chants of ``Millionaires! Bandits! Mafia!'' rose into cold air _
references to allegations that Zhivkov and his friends lived
luxuriously in mansions and hunting lodges.

   More than 1 million Britons are wheezing, running
fevers and nursing headaches during the nation's worst outbreak of
flu in 15 years, doctors said Thursday. Five flu-related deaths
have been reported.
   Among those who are suffering from what doctors call the English
flu is Queen Elizabeth II. This strain, physicians say, is a
variant of the Hong Kong flu that swept Britain in the winter of
1974-75.
   The Royal Society of General Practitioners said Thursday that
infection levels have reached epidemic levels and it expects
400,000 more cases to develop in the next four weeks.
   It said 109 people in every 100,000 had influenza last week and
a further 154 in every 100,000 had influenza-like illness. When the
sickness rate tops 100 per 100,000, the outbreak is considered an
epidemic.
   Infection levels in 1974-75 rose to an average weekly rate of
350 per 100,000 people, the society said.
   The dead are a 16-month-old child, a 7-year-old, two elderly
people and a 35-year-old woman who was six months pregnant. Her
baby could not be saved.
   Symptoms of the disease include fatigue, aching muscles,
headaches, coughing and prolonged fever lasting four or five days.
   Three million doses of flu vaccine have been administered, and
new stock has been flown in from France, West Germany and the
Netherlands.
   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke said on British Broadcasting
Corp. television that the health services were unprepared for the
epidemic.
   ``We do try to predict epidemics, but, frankly, it's rather like
trying to predict the weather,'' Clarke said. ``A lot of these
fairly basic diseases like flu do defeat sometimes the best
forecasts that the experts can produce.''
   Nearly 100 hospitals have canceled routine operations and turned
away all non-emergency cases because of a shortage of doctors and
nurses.
   The queen has canceled engagements since Dec. 6. Her sister,
Princess Margaret, was confined to bed this week.
   It's a bonanza though for the medicine industry.
   While many factories have been forced to slow their assembly
lines because of reduced staff, workers at Beecham Pharmaceuticals'
northern England plant are working overtime producing Hot Lemon and
Night Nurse cold treatments.
   ``Demand for our products has risen dramatically in the last few
weeks. We are rushed off our feet trying to keep up,'' said
Beecham's factory manager David Howarth.

<HEAD>Court Reinstates Charges Against Parents in Drinking Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The mother and stepfather of a 15-year-old
boy who died after being allowed to drink more than 25 ounces of
brandy at home must face homicide charges, a state appeals court
ruled Thursday.
   Stephen and Jeanne Garbarino will have to stand trial in the
death of Jeanne's son, Justin Russell, who choked on his own vomit
following the Jan. 18, 1988, drinking bout, said the Appellate
Division of the state Supreme Court.
   The court overturned a Rensselaer County Court decision throwing
out charges of criminally negligent homicide, reckless endangerment
and endangering the welfare of a child against the two adults.
   The court said the family began drinking together around the
kitchen table of their suburban East Greenbush home in response to
an unspecified ``family crisis.'' It soon escalated into a contest
between Russell and his stepfather over who could hold their liquor
better, the court said.
   The boy began vomiting and eventually died. He had a
blood-alcohol level of .41 when he died, the court said. A person
is legally intoxicated in New York state with a blood alcohol level
of .10.
   ``These people placed him in a very precarious position,
endangering his life and welfare by giving him this amount of
alcohol,'' said James Canfield, Rensselaer County district attorney.
   The county court threw out the homicide case, arguing it was
similar to another case where a court said a man could not be
convicted of criminally negligent homicide for giving heroin to a
person who later died of an overdose.
   But the Appellate Division said that shouldn't apply in the
Russell case, noting that the risk of death is ``greatly
increased'' by the amount of alcohol consumed by the boy.
   Lawyers representing both Garbarinos said they intended to
appeal the decision to the state's highest court. They said it
dangerously broadened the legal definition of criminal negligence.
   Peter Moschetti Jr., lawyer for Jeanne Garbarino, and Donald
Shanley, lawyer for Stephen Garbarino, said if the Appellate
Division decision is upheld it could place bartenders and party
hosts in danger of criminal prosecution in cases when they've given
guests too much to drink.
   ``Were they negligent? Yes,'' Moschetti said of the Garbarinos.
``But were they criminally negligent? There's a big difference
between criminal negligence and regular negligence.''
   The lower court found that the Garbarinos couldn't stand trial
for endangering the welfare of a child because of a state law that
says a parent can't be prosecuted for giving alcohol to a minor in
the home.
   But the Appellate Division said that provision only applied to
guardians who give a minimal amount of alcohol to children. The
court said experts testified that even a ``seasoned alcoholic''
would be endangered by drinking as much as Russell did that night.
   ``What purpose is it going to serve to have them (the
Garbarinos) sit in front of a jury and have to look at autopsy
photos of their son?'' Moschetti said.
   ``There is no way they intended to have their child die,''
Moschetti said. ``It's obviously a tragedy ... It's the worse thing
that can happen to a parent.''

   Parents and teachers in an area with a large
black population say they will petition ABC to save ``Homeroom,'' a
comedy series they say helps keep their kids in school.
   The half-hour program, which debuted in the fall, is being
canceled because of poor ratings, said ABC spokesman Jim Brochu.
   ``All we're saying is give the show a chance,'' said Jim Goins,
who counsels school dropouts in the Watts district. He and other
parents and teachers decided to petition the network after a
meeting Wednesday.
   ``There's not that many shows of color that deal with
educational issues, and we're in a dilemma right now as far as
having black male role models,'' Goins said. ``Not everyone can be
a Bill Cosby.''
   ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's top-rated comedy, stars Bill Cosby as
a doctor whose wife is a lawyer. ``Homeroom'' also has a black
star, Darryl Sivad, who plays a man who gave up a lucrative job in
advertising to teach fourth-graders at an inner-city public school.
   ``The theme of the show allows our children to witness constant
involvement of students in a classroom setting,'' said Goins.

<HEAD>Study: Child Safety Seats Reduce Baby Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laws requiring use of car child safety seats,
enacted in the last decade by all 50 states, have reduced infant
and toddler traffic accident deaths more than 30 percent, according
to a study.
   ``We found that after the laws were adopted there was about a 30
percent drop in fatalities for toddlers and about a 39 percent drop
for infants,'' William Evans, associate professor of economics at
the University of Maryland-College Park, said Thursday.
   The study, sponsored by the Harvard Injury Prevention Center,
was written by Evans and John D. Graham, associate professor at the
Harvard School of Public Health.
   The study compared each state's child auto accident fatality
rate before and after a child restraint law went into effect, Evans
said.
   Child restraint laws save about 160 lives annually in this
country, according to the study, which was based on statistics
compiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by the
Centers for Disease Control's fatal accident reporting system.
   The findings confirm the rationale behind laws requiring
children to be buckled in, Evans said.
   ``We were trying to quantify _ did these laws actually save
lives?'' Evans said. ``We did know that child safety seats were
effective. The only question was how effective were they, given the
usage rates in the population.''
   Tennessee was the first state to enact a child restraint law in
1978. Seven years later all 50 states had passed such legislation.
During that period usage rates rose from 17 percent to 78 percent,
according to federal statistics, Evans said.
   While the Department of Transportation had compiled studies
showing the rate of usage of child restraints, Evans said, ``Just
looking at usage rates was not enough because there is this problem
of gross misuse of child safety seats.''
   Many parents do not use the restraints properly _ for instance,
not buckling children in properly.
   However, he said, the study found that enough parents are using
the devices properly to save a significant number of lives.
   The study is to be published in an upcoming issue of The Journal
of Health Economics, Evans said.

   This city's first black mayor announced
Thursday that he won't seek the job he held for eight years.
   Speculation had been high for months that Dutch Morial, who was
mayor from 1978 to 1986 but was prohibited from seeking a third
consecutive term, would run against incumbent Sidney Barthelemy and
challenger Donald Mintz.
   At a news conference Thursday, Morial, 60, said he could have
won the race, but has decided that the demands on his family during
a campaign would be too much.
   ``It's a difficult decision, but the circumstances and the
balancing, the ups and downs and all of the other things that one
has to weigh have dictated it's in perhaps a mutual best interest
that I not seek the office of mayor in 1990,'' Morial said.
``However, that does not preclude other possibilities.''
   He didn't name those possibilities, but he's been mentioned as a
possible candidate for Congress, among other offices.
   Qualifying for the Feb. 3 mayor's race ends Friday afternoon. So
barring a last-minute candidcil member who was a thorn in
the Morial administration's side, and Mintz, an attorney who has
supported Morial in the past.
   Barthelemy succeeded Morial after Morial supporters failed to
persuade voters to change the city charter so the mayor could serve
more than two consecutive terms.

<HEAD>Accord Reached on $15.2 Billion in Loans for Poorest Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agreement was reached Thursday by the United
States and 31 other governments on $15.2 billion worth of easy
loans for more than 50 of the world's poorest countries over a
three-year period.
   ``Ninety percent of the money will go to countries where the
average annual income is $400 a year or less,'' said World Bank
President Barber B. Conable.
   The money will come from the 32 countries with the United States
furnishing the largest share. The total U.S. contribution was put
at $3.18 billion by George A. Folsum, deputy assistant secretary of
the treasury for developing nations.
   Conable said he expects President Bush to ask Congress for the
first $1.08 billion in his next budget, early in the new year. The
overall package of loan money will be available starting next July
1.
   ``We are very pleased with the size of this contribution because
it maintains the size of the U.S. contribution in real terms,''
Folsum said.
   For the previous three years, the United States made the same
contribution, $3.18 billion.
   The new money will be lent out by the bank's International
Development Association for as long as 40 years, at only nominal
interest. With repayments made on loans from earlier years, the
bank expects to have to have about $5.5 billion a year for this
type of loan, Conable said.
   Japan's contribution will be a close second: $3.05 billion at
the exchange rate Folsum used, up from $2.76 billion for the
previous three years.
   The announcement said that $302 million of Japan's contribution
was critical to reaching the final agreement. The accord had been
held back by U.S. delay in agreeing to its share.
   Conable said that China and India are expected to be the biggest
borrowers, taking about $2.3 billion each over the three years.
After China's suppression last June of the movement for democracy,
Conable cut off new loans though continuing to disburse loans
granted earlier.
   ``We hope to resume lending in the not-too-distant future, but
there is no specific date,'' he said.
   He added that the bank is analyzing Chinese financial programs
and other data. ``We're not a political institution,'' he said.
``We talk about economic performance,'' he said.
   Bush nevertheless asked that loans to China be suspended, as
part of his measures against the Chinese government. Last month he
signed into law a bill that requires him to hold back $115 million
of an earlier U.S. contribution unless he certifies that the World
Bank's loans to China will promote individual freedoms and human
rights there.

   Both the Warsaw Pact and NATO presented
proposals Thursday designed to reduce six categories of
conventional weapons in Europe and produce an agreement that can be
signed next year.
   After the Warsaw Pact presentation, Polish delegate Wlodzimierz
Konarski told reporters on behalf of the alliance:
   ``The introduction of the East European project is an important
step forward in the negotiations but it is not sufficient. We need
a similar presentation of the Western side ... to have a good basis
for cooperative drafting.''
   NATO presented a proposal several hours later under which the
superpowers would be limited to 275,000 soldiers each and the
numbers of tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear weapons would be
reduced sharply.
   The Western draft ``will strongly spur the negotiations,'' West
German negotiator Ruediger Hartmann said after Spain introduced the
proposal.
   In Geneva, U.S.-Soviet talks aimed at speeding work on a global
ban of chemical weapons adjourned Thursday with the chief U.S.
representative expressing optimism.
   ``I believe a chemical weapons convention, particularly with the
emphasis President Bush has put on it, is highly possible within
the next year or two,'' Max Friedersdorf said in the U.S. Mission's
official Daily Bulletin.
   Since the Vienna talks on conventional weapons began in March,
both sides have praised the spirit of cooperation and expressed
hope for speedy agreement. Their positions are close on ceilings
for some weapons categories.
   In the Warsaw Pact draft presented Thursday, Moscow and its
allies proposed a limit of 4,700 combat airplanes each for each
alliance.
   They also suggested limits of 20,000 battle tanks and 1,900
combat helicopters in an area extending from the Atlantic Ocean to
the Ural Mountains.
   NATO proposed ceilings of 5,700 combat airplanes and the same
numbers as the Warsaw Pact for tanks and helicopters, according to
reports from within the meeting.
   Like the NATO draft, the 40-page Warsaw presentation contained
suggestions for limiting call-ups of reservists and the scope of
military exercises.
   This round of negotiations runs through next week. Still to be
resolved when the talks resume Jan. 11 is the problem of
definitions _ the descriptions of some arms categories.
   The Soviet Union insists, for instance, that more than 1,000
``air defense interceptors'' protecting defenses around Moscow and
the Urals be excluded from reductions in combat airplanes.
   It says the jets are not suitable for either ground attack or
surprise air attack.

<HEAD>State's Bond Ratings Blamed on Political Paralysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bonds issued by Massachusetts have plunged to the
bottom of the nation's ratings as the state's budget deficit has
ballooned above $800 million and lawmakers have failed to come up
with spending cuts or taxes.
   ``The rating problem is really a political one, not an economic
one,'' Wayne Ayers, senior economist at Bank of Boston, said
Thursday.
   This week, Standard &amp; Poor's dropped the state's bond rating
from A to BBB, the lowest in the nation. In November, Moody's
Investors Service dropped Massachusetts from A to Baa 1, tying it
with Louisiana for the bottom ranking.
   ``I'm not aware of a state general obligation rating that has
dropped so quickly,'' Robert Swerdling, assistant vice president of
municipal finance at Standard &amp; Poor's, said Thursday. ``What we're
looking at is a situation that has gone on too long.''
   Economists note that the state government reaped benefits from
the boom years of the mid-1980s while failing to prepare for
cyclical changes. Some also say the presidential campaign of Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis diverted attention from the impending trouble.
   ``It's clear that the signs of the budget problem emerged early
in 1988 and could have been addressed sooner,'' said Sara Johnson,
managing economist at DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington.
   The deficit has its roots in the state's economic downturn, as a
depressed real estate market and a slump in high-tech manufacturing
have led to lower state revenues. But economists say government
officials should have foreseen the trouble and should have saved
money to avoid a fiscal crisis.
   ``The deficit and the bond rating suggest a lack of foresight in
the good years,'' Johnson said.
   When the Massachusetts economy was booming in the middle 1980s,
Johnson said, state officials sharply increased government
spending, ``rather than use the revenues to build up a surplus to
protect the state in a downturn.''
   ``This has been building for a couple of years. It might have
been submerged because of the presidential campaign,'' said Peter
Kozel, chief economist at Shawmut Bank in Boston. ``It's just that
the issue wasn't discussed very much.''
   George Leung, vice president for state ratings at Moody's, said
he has not previously witnessed such a lack of resolve in the
Massachusetts government.
   ``I think it's been the lack of any real consensus in the
government to address the problems, both in the executive branch
and in the legislative branch,'' he said.
   Leung said while Massachusetts and Louisiana sit at the bottom
of the rankings, the two states have different situations. ``In
Louisiana, it's more fundamental economic issues,'' he said.
``Here, it's much different.''
   In Massachusetts, ``the growth in the deficit is related to a
weakening economy, but more importantly the lack of timely action
to deal with it led us to lower the rating,'' he said.
   Other states have had fiscal troubles, but they have done a
better job keeping their books balanced and maintaining their bond
ratings.
   ``There are many states with weaker economies than Massachusetts
that have higher bond ratings,'' Swerdling said.
   Bond rating officials said, however, that eliminating the debt
will not simply return Massachusetts to its lofty level. Forecasts
call for continued softness in the state economy, and this could
lead to more fiscal strains in the future, Leung said.
   Also, the lower bond ratings mean higher borrowing costs for the
state, ``which makes a bad situation worse,'' Ayers said.

   Here is the text of the remarks President Bush
delivered Thursday night before lighting the National Christmas
Tree on the Ellipse.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   This is the Christmas that we've awaited for 50 years. And
across Europe, east and west, 1989 is ending bright with the
prospect of a far better Christmastime than Europe has ever known;
a far better future than the world dared to imagine.
   And 50 winters have come and gone since darkness closed over
Europe in 1939, fifty years. But last month, as Lech Walesa was
coming to the White House, the wall in Berlin came tumbling down.
And another winter descended across Europe. Spring returned to
Prague and unconquerable people, unquenchable dreams.
   And today, there's a new sound at the wall, a new sound rings
out, not the hammer and sickle, but the hammer and the chisel. The
glad sound you hear is not only the bells of Christmas, but also
the bells of freedom.
   And in this new season of hope, the triumph looms _ it's just
like the joy of Christmas _ not a triumph for one particular
country or one particular religion, but a triumph for all human
kind.
   The holidays are, as we've seen here tonight, a time of laughter
and children and counting our blessings. A time when songs fill the
air and hopes fill our hearts for peace on earth, goodwill to men.
   We've worked hard this year, all of us, all of you, to help, to
help build a better america, help someone else, help make this a
kinder and gentler nation.
   But there remains a world at need all around us.
   And this holiday season, reach out to someone right where you
live because from now on in America _ ``There's no room at the
inn,'' that's simply not an acceptable answer _ from now on in
America, any definition of a successful life must include serving
others.
   For Christmas is measured not by what's beneath your tree but by
what's inside your heart. So this year, the spirit of the holidays
is at long last matched by the spirit of the times.
   And it's the beginning of a new decade at the ending of an old
century. And whatever your dream, whatever star you're following,
the future is bright with possibilities. So Barbara and I want to
wish all of you a very merry Christmas and now, with simultaneous
tree-lightings from coast to coast, in Charleston and Santa Cruz,
let's show our thousand points of light. Let's turn on the National
Christmas Tree.

   A war with drug gangs has cost nearly
300 lives in four months, so what was Colombia's top story of 1989?
A poll found it was the national soccer team's qualification for
World Cup play.
   The newspaper El Tiempo reported Thursday that 34.9 percent of
people interviewed for the poll, conducted for Credencial magazine,
thought the soccer team's good fortune was the most important thing
that happened in 1989.
   The assassination Aug. 18 of presidential candidate Luis Carlos
Galan, which caused the government to crack down on cocaine barons,
was second with 19.8 and the drug war itself third with 12.3
percent.
   Poll takers questioned 344 people in four cities.

   About 400 ethnic Albanians clashed
with police Thursday night in the Kosovo town of Pec, denouncing
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and demanding release of
former Kosovo leader Azem Vlasi, Tanjug news agency reported.
   The protesters hurled stones at security personnel as they
marched through the streets before police dispersed them and took
four Albanians into custody.
   The incident was prompted by a change of street names in the
town near the border with Albania. The streets now bear names of
Serbian rather than Albanian notables.
   The change was in line with Serbian constitutional amendments
enacted last spring that effectively curtailed the autonomy of
Kosovo, one of two provinces of Serbia, the largest Yugoslav
republic.
   Vlasi, Kosovo's former communist leader, is on trial in Titova
Mitrovica on counterrevolutionary charges. He was accused of
inspiring a weeklong miners' strike and riots in the province in
which at least 25 people died.
   Vlasi said his trial was politically motivated.
   Sporadic battles with riot police, now regularly posted in the
streets, have become commonplace in the province.

<TEXT>
   The man charged with 27 counts of murder
in the nation's worst drunken-driving accident took the stand
Thursday and apologized to family members of some of the dead.
   ``I really am sorry and I mean this,'' Larry Mahoney said in a
tight voice at the conclusion of one hour and 10 minutes of
testimony. Both members of the victims' families and Mahoney's
family broke into tears.
   ``I would probably feel the same way that you feel about this,''
the 36-year-old factory worker said. ``I wanted to let you know I
really am sorry. I mean it. ... I know it's not going to make you
feel any different toward me.''
   Behind Mahoney on the witness stand was a large seating chart of
the church bus, with color photographs and names of the 67
passengers. The names of the 24 children and three adults killed in
the fiery crash were designated with a black letter ``D.''
   Mahoney faces multiple life sentences if convicted of the
charges: 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton endangerment, 12
counts of assault and a count of drunken driving.
   Mahoney said he had no recollection of leaving a small drinking
party and colliding with a crowded church bus on Interstate 71 on
May 14, 1988. Mahoney, who was testifying for the first time in the
trial, also said he had no intention of getting drunk that day.
   ``It's a fact I was involved in an accident, but I don't
remember seeing the bus,'' Mahoney said. ``I remember waking up in
the hospital. ''
   Mahoney said he ``hates'' hard alcohol because it irritates his
ulcer. At the party, he remembered asking for a beer. None was
available, a man he had just met offered him a mixed drink. A clear
liquid Mahoney couldn't identify was poured into a glass.
   ``I took a big drink of it and I coughed and choked on it,'' he
said. Some of the men laughed at him, he recalled.
   Asked if he drank any more of the clear liquid, Mahoney said,
``There's no way I could drink two glasses of something like that.''
   He then recalled drinking what he believed to be Pepsi from a
glass to get the taste of the alcohol out of his mouth.
   In previous testimony, witnesses had said the soda was mixed
with vodka, but Mahoney said he couldn't taste anything in the
drink. He said he never remembered getting the keys to his truck
and driving away.
   The prosecution contends an intoxicated Mahoney, driving the
wrong way on the interstate, crashed into the bus. The defense
contends that the design of the bus, built before federal safety
standards were tightened, contributed to the deaths, which
examiners said resulted from the fire, not the original crash.
   In earlier testimony, the defense's accident reconstruction
expert, Wilbur R. Meredith III, was cross-examined about his
conclusion that Mahoney's truck first hit a Cadillac beside the bus
and then struck the bus.
   A previous reconstruction by Kentucky State Police, relying on
eyewitness accounts, investigation of accident scene evidence and
other information, found that Mahoney's truck first hit the bus and
then collided with the Cadillac.
   Mahoney's attorney, William Summers, said the defense's
reconstruction provides the jury with a more complete picture of
what authorities say is the nation's worst drunken-driving accident.
   ``I'm a lawyer, not Houdini. I'm not going to try to put him on
the other side of the road,'' Summers said. ``And I'm damned sure
I'm not going to be able to sober him up.''
   During cross-examination by Assistant Attorney General Paul
Richwalsky Jr., Meredith said his reconstruction does not
contradict eyewitness accounts of Mahoney's truck colliding first
with the bus. Meredith said the eyewitnesses couldn't see the
collision with a Cadillac from their viewing angle.

   About 100 Vietnamese boat people attacked a
guard with iron bars after two days of peaceful demonstrations
against the new policy of forced repatriation, officials said
Friday.
   About 8,000 refugees demonstrated without incident Thursday
against forced return to their Communist homeland and protests
spread to more detention camps before the violent incident, the
officials reported.
   An officer of the Correctional Services Department was attacked
late Thursday when he saw about 100 refugees in the Chimawan
detention center trying to tear something down, the Government
Information Service reported. Whether it was an escape attempt was
not clear.
   After the attack, the refugees ran back to their barracks and
the officer was treated for minor injuries, according to the
report. It said an investigation revealed that some window bars and
iron bars for hanging clothes were missing.
   Protests Wednesday and Thursday were prompted by the
repatriation of 51 Vietnamese against their will Tuesday. They were
pulled screaming and crying from their detention center and put on
a plane to Hanoi.
   About 56,000 Vietnamese refugees are housed in squalid camps in
Hong Kong.
   Under the new program, those who arrived before June 1988 remain
eligible for resettlement overseas, but the approximately 44,000
who arrived later are to be sent back if they are classified as
illegal immigrants.
   About 6,800 already have been given that designation, compared
with slightly more than 700 accorded refugee status.
   The government said Thursday a Vietnamese man was found hanging
inside one of the camps. In a hospital, his condition was described
as fair.
   There have been fears that forced repatriation would cause
suicide attempts. The Information Service report said the man was
under investigation in connection with a robbery and his attempt to
kill himself was not believed linked to repatriation.
   More than 2,000 Vietnamese men, women and children _ many
wearing white headbands symbolizing protest _ marched through the
Sham Shui Po detention center in urban Kowloon under banners that
read ``Forced repatriation is homicide'' and ``Save our souls.''
   They thrust their fists into the air as they marched around the
camp's playground. A few plainclothesmen kept watch.
   At one point, protesters gathered in front of a makeshift altar
that had eggs piled on it and a sign that said: ``Requiem ceremony
for 51 souls.'' An official said the eggs were a religious offering
for the repatriated Vietnamese.
   About 4,000 Vietnamese protested at two separate centers on Hei
Ling Chau Island, a former leper colony, and 2,000 more
demonstrated at Whitehead detention center in the New Territories,
said Francis Ma, spokesman for the Correctional Services Department
which runs the camps.
   On Wednesday, about 6,000 Vietnamese protested at three centers,
with some shouting they would rather die than return to Vietnam.
   British and Hong Kong officials say involuntarily repatriation
will continue despite international criticism. They say returning
the Vietnamese is more humane than keeping them indefintely in
crowded camps where violence is rife.
   The United States has criticized the repatriation policy,
provoking anger in Britain.
   Foreign Office Minister Francis Maude described as ``misguided''
a State Department statement Tuesday that the repatriations were
unacceptable.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper published
an account Thursday of how Todor Zhivkov, the undisputed leader for
35 years, ignored an airplane disaster that occurred as his craft
was preparing for takeoff.
   Rumors had circulated here that the Jan. 2, 1988, crash took
place as the Zhivkov plane was about to leave Sofia for the port of
Varna. Only in the last few weeks, however, have details begun to
emerge in the news media of bad deeds by the toppled Zhivkov.
Zhivkov was forced out of office Nov. 10.
   A Jak-42 plane rolled off a runway into a field and burst into
flames, killing 27 people. Many children were said to have been
among the victims.
   The daily Rabotnichesko Delo said ``the fact was concealed''
from the start that Zhivkov was preparing to take off, according to
the state BTA news agency.
   Maj. Petar Zinoviev, the military chief of the flight center,
was quoted as saying in a first-hand account that Zhivkov was
informed of the accident before takeoff, but left as planned,
flying only 650 feet over the burning wreck.
   The Jak crashed at 5:32 p.m. and Zhivkov's plane took off at
6:22 p.m., the paper said.

<HEAD>Panama's Lawmakers Consider New Power for Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president Thursday told lawmakers
convened to consider naming Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega chief of
government that the United States had ``declared war on all
Panamanians.''
   Provisional President Francisco Rodriguez spoke at the
inauguration of the new People's Assembly, a legislature that
Noriega has been named to coordinate.
   The assembly, whose membership is entirely pro-Noriega, was
formed from 510 mayors and county chairmen nationwide to replace
the legitimate National Assembly, whose mandate expired Sept. 1.
   Among the issues of the two-day meeting is naming Noriega as
Panama's chief of government with powers greater than those of
Rodriguez.
   Noriega, wanted in the United States on federal drug trafficking
and money laundering charges, is already the Defense Forces chief
and the nation's de facto ruler.
   The general annulled May 7 national elections when returns
showed the opposition was winning by a landslide, blocking
selection of a new National Assembly and president.
   Afterward, Noriega named Rodriguez, a 51-year-old economist and
Noriega associate, as provisional president.
   If the People's Assembly approves new powers for Noriega,
Rodriguez's post would largely be reduced to a ceremonial one.
   However, military and other sources speaking on condition of
anonymity said they were advising Noriega against accepting such an
appointment for public relations reasons.
   Since the U.S. indictments, Washington has been exerting
diplomatic and economic pressure, including trade and other
sanctions, to force Noriga out of power.
   But so far, the strongman has remained in place, weathering coup
attempt by senior officers in March 1988 and October 1989.
   Talking to journalists before delivering his speech to
lawmakers, Rodriguez praised Noriega as a man who ``had all the
qualities for becoming chief of government.''
   ``It is evident now that the true intention of the U.S. in its
campaigning in favor of a supposed democracy ... is a war against
all Panamanians, against the government and against the opposition,
and against those who are not aligned with a political group,''
Rodriguez said in his speech.
   ``The United States does not care even about the political
groups that have repesented its political and economic interests
here. It is not Noriega they want to do away with, but our national
ability to be independent,'' he said.
   In another development Thursday, the Foreign Ministry said it
agreed to a request by European Economic Community ambassadors for
the release of a group of civilian political prisoners.
   Acting Foreign Minister Abelardo Carles said the Panamanian
government will have a ``a positive answer.''
   French ambassador Jacques Rummelhardt said the request was made
``in the spirit of the Christmas season.''
   The government did not say how many or who would be freed.

<HEAD>Two Rifle Grenades Fired at U.S. Housing Compound</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assailants Thursday fired two rifle
grenades into an American housing and recreation compound, causing
no injuries and only minor damage, U.S. officials said.
   The attack came a week after a bloody coup attempt that left at
least 113 people dead was thwarted with help of U.S. war jets.
   Later, a grenade exploded at the house of an unidentified
American diplomat in Manila's Makati financial district, the U.S.
Embassy said. One Filipino workman who was repairing the roof was
slightly injured.
   The army said more security patrols had been set up near the
seaside compound and the U.S. Embassy, 2{ miles to the north.
   Embassy spokesman David Andriessen said the device that exploded
at the house could have been fired last week during coup-associated
fighting, not intentionally planted.
   The U.S. Embassy denounced Thursday's attack on the Seafront
compound as a ``cowardly act'' by ``terrorists'' who could have
killed some of the hundreds of Americans who live and work in the
compound, which includes the American Club, sports field,
commissary and housing for government employees.
   Police said four cars were damaged when the grenades exploded
near the U.S. military post office and near an apartment complex
for U.S. families.
   President Corazon Aquino telephoned U.S. Ambassador Nicholas
Platt to assure him that Philippine authorities would take all
measures to protect Americans.
   There was no claim of responsibility, but Brig. Gen. Alexander
Aguirre, chief of the police Capital Command, said the attackers
could have been rebel soldiers who launched a coup attempt against
Mrs. Aquino on Dec. 1.
   The incident followed threats against U.S. interests by rebel
soldiers after U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for government
forces during the coup attempt, which ended Saturday.
   Police said five armed men were seen abandoning a van near the
compound soon after the attack. Inside the van, police found a
plastic container for a rifle grenade with serial numbers identical
to those on a grenade fragment recovered on the compound.
   The owner of the van, Armando Pantaleon, told troops that three
men with .45-caliber pistols had taken his van at gunpoint about an
hour before the attack.
   ``The terrorists involved clearly did not care if they harmed
innocent civilians, including women, children and men,'' Platt said
in a statement.
   Americans were warned to stay away from the U.S. Embassy and
other U.S. facilities ``in the immediate future.'' The U.S.
military banned non-essential travel to Manila by the 40,000 U.S.
troops, military dependents and civilian employees at the six U.S.
military bases north and west of the capital.
   Authorities say about half the estimated 3,000 troops who took
part are still at large.
   On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said remnants of the
rebel force still retain the capability to launch ``terrorist
attacks, sabotage and assassination.''
   Two people were killed and 18 injured when an assailant threw a
grenade Saturday into Manila's main post office.
   In other developments, the government's intelligence chief told
the Senate Intelligence Oversight Committee on Thursday that rebels
were planning another move against the government to be launched in
the central Visayas islands and on Mindanao island.
   Rodolfo Canieso, chief of the National Intelligence Coordinating
Agency, said 60 percent of the 160,000-member armed forces would
accept whatever government emerged victorious in a future coup.
   Canieso, a retired major general and former army commander,
warned that the entire Philippine society was ``in a state of
flux.''
   A joint legislative committee late Thursday approved a
compromise bill granting Mrs. Aquino emergency powers for six
months. The committee will refer the new bill to the Senate and
House of Representatives on Monday. Both chambers had approved
differing versions of the emergency bill.
   Mrs. Aquino declared an indefinite state of emergency Dec. 6 and
this week asked Congress to grant specific powers under the
declaration.

   A planned agreement between the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers aimed at carrying
out President Bush's campaign pledge to preserve wetlands may be
put on hold for 30 days, an EPA spokeswoman said Thursday.
   The memorandum of agreement, which was scheduled to take effect
Friday, has sparked an intense struggle within the administration.
The departments of Energy and Transportation oppose it and the
Council on Environmental Quality and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration are in favor.
   Congressional sources, who spoke on condition that they not be
identified, also said the Interior Department has split, with the
Fish and Wildlife Service favoring immediate implementation and the
Minerals Management Service opposed.
   Environmentalists are keeping a close watch on the dispute,
which has been growing since EPA and the Corps initialled the new
agreement early last month.
   ``I think this is a real litmus test of Bush's commitment to
wetlands protection,'' said Jan Goldman-Carter, counsel to the
National Wildlife Federation's fish and wildlife division.
   ``We feel if the memorandum of agreement is second-guessed by
the administration now it will signal the end of any real effort by
the Bush administration to reverse the wetlands losses we have been
experiencing,'' Ms. Goldman-Carter said.
   Alicia Tenuta, an EPA spokeswoman, said that while no decision
had been made on whether to delay the agreement, delay was ``a
definite possibility.''
   Ms. Tenuta said that other agencies and the White House have
been ``very interested'' in the agreement.
   ``The White House wants to make clear what this means to
everyone,'' Ms. Tenuta said. ``Sure, they had a hand in slowing it
down and making sure we talked it over with the other parties.''
   In last year's presidential campaign, Bush endorsed a policy of
``No net loss'' of wetlands like swamps, bogs, fens, marshes and
tidal estuaries, often craved for residential, commercial and
agricultural development. The goal emerged from recommendations of
the Conservation Foundation, whose then head, William Reilly, was
appointed EPA administrator by Bush.
   In recent years, environmentalists have come to recognize the
value of these areas for wildlife habitat, purification of polluted
waterways, flood control and other purposes.
   There have been estimates that as many as 400,000 acres per year
of wetlands were being lost in recent decades.
   On Wednesday, Bush signed a bill authorizing $15 million a year
aimed at rebuilding duck populations by purchasing 2 million acres
of critical wetlands.
   Federal law requires that the Corps grant a permit before
developers may put fill in most wetlands. EPA may challenge the
decision and has certain veto powers over it, and the two agencies
frequently had been at odds.
   Under the new memo, the Corps agreed to ``strive to avoid
adverse impacts and offset unavoidable adverse impacts to existing
aquatic resources, and for wetlands, will strive to achieve a goal
of no overall net loss of values and functions.''
   The memorandum also formally implements guidelines for granting
permits where an applicant first has to try to avoid hurting
wetlands, and if that fails, to minimize the damage.
   If the project would still cause significant harm, the applicant
would have to compensate for the loss, perhaps by creating new ones
or restoring old, damaged areas.
   ``This memorandum was a clear commitment on the part of these to
agencies to move forward and protect wetlands,'' said Ms.
Goldman-Carter. ``Two agencies that were usually at odds had come
together.''
   The agreement has come under fire from the oil industry in
Alaska and the Alaska congressional delegation.
   ``Their approach to `no net loss'' of wetlands would mean no net
growth for Alaska'' and its oil industry, said Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, in a letter to White House chief of staff John Sununu.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, said in a letter to Bush, the
agreement came as ``quite a surprise'' and he thought a special
Domestic Policy Council task force was going to develop a national
wetlands policy, not two agencies.
   Thursday, Cowper said Alaska would sue if it failed to win the
changes it wannted in the new policy.
   ``It may make sense in the lower 48, where wetlands are scarce,
but it's crazy in Alaska,'' the governor said.

<HEAD>Broadcast Report: Pentagon Authorizing Military In Fight Against
Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has authorized plans by military
units to capture fugitive drug criminals in foreign countries,
according to a report broadcast Thursday.
   CBS News reported that, among the units to receive the
authorization, is the special Delta hostage rescue team formed
after Americans were taken captive in Iran.
   The news program said the U.S. military became involved after an
informant told the U.S. government last summer that Pablo Escobar,
one of the kingpins of the Colombian drug trade, was hiding at a
seaside villa in Panama.
   CBS said troops and helicopters moved to a U.S. base in nearby
Puerto Rico to prepare for an attempted capture Labor Day weekend
only to abort the plan because there was only a 70 percent chance
the informant was correct.
   As it turned out, Escobar was not in Panama that weekend, the
report said.
   CBS did not identify its sources, referring only to officials.
   Maj. David Super, a spokesman for the Pentagon, told The
Associated Press on Thursday that he knew nothing about the CBS
report or any such authorization for U.S. troops.
   Chief Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said, ``We do not comment
on such matters.''
   ``We cannot comment on possible contingencies or operations. The
bottom line is, no comment,'' said deputy White House spokesman
Roman Popadiuk.
   In October, it became known that in July the Office of Legal
Counsel issued a memo authorizing the FBI to arrest fugitives
overseas without the permission of the host country.
   This came as a surprise to the White House and State Department,
which insisted no such things would be done without ``full
interagency discussion'' and presidential decision.
   This reverses a 1980 policy that was issued in response to an
FBI proposal to kidnap fugitive financier Robert Vesco, accused of
milking mutual funds of hundreds of millions of dollars before
fleeing in 1973.
   In 1987, the FBI lured hijacker Fawaz Younis to a yacht off
Cyprus and arrested him in international waters. He was sentenced
in U.S. District Court in Washington to 30 years in prison for
hijacking a Jordanian airliner in 1985 that carried some U.S.
citizens.
   Luis Arce Gomez, identified by CBS as the former ``minister of
cocaine'' for Bolivia, was captured and brought to the United
States earlier this week by Bolivian police and agents from the
Drug Enforcement Administration.
   CBS quoted Abraham Sofaer, a legal adviser to the State
Department, as saying recently that one drug syndicate has
threatened to kill Americans ``systematically, including government
officials.''
   ``If someone makes that kind of assertion, I am going to have to
tell my officials, `Well, you know, you can treat this as an
attack. You might be able to exercise force in self-defense,''' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Municipal officials in the biblical town of
Bethlehem announced Thursday they had canceled community Christmas
celebrations for the third year in a row to support the Palestinian
uprising.
   The town in the occupied West Bank is revered as the birthplace
of Christ.
   Municipal officials in Beit Sahour, to the east, also said they
would call off their Christmas celebrations to back the uprising.
   Beit Sahour is surrounded by fields where Christians believe the
birth of Christ was announced to shepherds.
   It will be the third consecutive Christmas that the towns, both
homes to Christian Arabs, will forgo putting up decorations,
lighting municipal trees or holding receptions.
   However, several holiday events sponsored by the Israeli
military government or by Christian groups will go ahead in both
communities, Israeli officials said. Included is a
government-sponsored choir program near the Church of the Nativity
in Bethlehem.
   Municipal officials cited both the uprising and six weeks of tax
raids carried out by soldiers and Israeli revenue agents in Beit
Sahour as reasons for canceling Christmas celebrations.
   ``How can we celebrate when our people are suffering?'' said
Bethlehem Municipal Secretary Jamal Salman. ``We must respect the
martyrs, the people in prison and to protest against unfair
taxation and what is happening in Beit Sahour.''
   Salman said there will be no decorations or receptions in
Bethlehem, but he said traditional religious ceremonies will be
held in the town of 35,000 Palestinians, who include 10,000
Christians.
   Six people from Bethlehem and Beit Sahour were among the 631
Palestinians killed by Israelis in the 2-year-old uprising. At
least 155 other Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs as
suspected collaborators with Israel. Forty-three Israelis have died
in the violence.
   The uprising leaders are demanding an end to Israeli rule in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In Beit Sahour, a Christian Arab town of about 10,000, the tax
raids carried out in September and October were aimed at ending a
tax boycott called by the underground leaders of the uprising.

<TEXT>
   Redoubt Volcano erupted Thursday on the
west side of Cook Inlet, hurling volcanic ash seven miles into the
air and prompting the evacuation of seven oil workers as a
precaution.
   The volcano, which last erupted 23 years ago, is 115 miles
southwest of Anchorage.
   ``We had confirmation from a MarkAir pilot who sighted an ash
plume at 35,000 feet,'' said John Davies, state seismologist. ``As
far as I know, no health advisories have been issued yet. We'll
wait and see how much ash gets into the air.''
   An Air Force pilot flying a jet fighter west of Anchorage when
the eruption occurred shortly after 10 a.m. said ash rose from
15,000 feet to about 40,000 feet within 10 minutes.
   ``We went right over that mountain on our way out to the
(training) area and there was nothing happening,'' said Capt. Steve
Stoddard, an F-15 pilot. He said he flew back over the area within
30 minutes and saw the ash cloud.
   ``As we were heading back, I could see we'd have to fly through
it, so we turned down south and flew around the south side of it,''
Stoddard said.
   Oscar Nelson, a bread-truck driver who was on a highway across
the inlet from the volcano when it erupted, said the ash was ``real
white and fluffy, almost like a cumulus cloud.''
   ``We didn't hear any sound,'' said Nelson. ``We just noticed a
plume starting to rise and thought we should jump out and get some
pictures.''
   Seven of 11 workers at the Drift River oil storage facility, the
nearest habitation some 20 miles from the volcano, were evacuated
as a precaution because of the danger of flooding, said Harold
Mouser, the manager of Cook Inlet Pipeline Co., operator of the
facility.
   ``Our people have seen nothing, they felt nothing,'' he said.
   He said some of the workers were evacuated in a light plane that
had gone to the site for a routine grocery delivery, and the others
were transported in a plane sent because of the eruption. The oil
facility was closed. Mouser said a helicopter was standing by for
possible evacuation of the four employees who remained at the site
as monitors.
   The U.S. Geological Survey had warned pilots Wednesday that
there might be an ``ash hazard'' from the 10,197-foot volcano.
Gritty volcanic ash is abrasive and can damage aircraft engines.
   Davies said seismologists from several state and federal
agencies had been monitoring activity beneath Redoubt Volcano for
nearly a week, and activity increased about midday Wednesday.
   ``We were here all night long,'' he said from his office at the
University of Alaska Fairbanks. ``At 10:13 this morning, there was
an obvious and very dramatic increase in activity. It indicated
magma moving at depth, then increased activity at the summit.''
   Concerns associated with the eruption include potential flash
flooding of the Drift River from melted snow, the agency said. Such
flooding occurred the last time the volcano erupted, in 1966.
   The Alaska Division of Emergency Services said a light dusting
of ash was observed in the Wasilla area, about 40 miles northeast
of Anchorage, shortly after noon Thursday.
   ``You can feel the grit,'' said Jim Sey, operations and planning
chief for the division.
   ``I don't think there's too much to be concerned about on this
particular eruption at this time,'' Sey said. Rather, he said,
concerns involved the possibility of successive eruptions.
   ``It's just sort of a wait-and-see game,'' Sey said.
   There were no immediate reports of ash in Anchorage.
   Redoubt Volcano is within the Lake Clark National Park and
Preserve and has been active at least four times during this
century. Until the last few years, the volcano had an active steam
vent near its summit.
   An apparent steam flume from the flank of the volcano was
visible from Anchorage during clear weather Friday, the USGS said.

<HEAD>American Airline In-Flight News to Lack Air Crash Video</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Because CBS refused to cut stories about air
crashes and other airline problems from the daily in-flight news
shows it provides American Airlines, it is losing American's
business on Feb. 28, a CBS official says.
   So in March, taped CNN newscasts _ without pictures of airline
crash stories _ will continue on the airline, thanks to an unusual
contract Turner Home Entertainment says it expects to sign next
week with American.
   American's rationale may be to avoid alarming passengers, but
``it's like passing out newspapers with holes cut in them,'' says
David Berman, a vice-president of CBS Broadcast International.
   ``The agreement is limited to (stories about) air crashes,''
says Steve Chamberlain, vice-president of Turner Home
Entertainment, which merchandises programs of Cable News Network,
part of Ted Turner's cable empire.
   ``There will not be any other wholesale editing of our
product,'' he adds. ``Above all, we have to preserve the
journalistic integrity of our network.''
   Although he said air crash stories would be edited from CNN's
in-flight news packages for American, Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman
for the airline, said Thursday that this doesn't mean a complete
blackout of such stories.
   ``What the contract with CNN calls for is that CNN will not show
the video,'' she said by phone from American headquarters in
Dallas. ``They will talk, in the audio portion, about these kinds
of incidents. But they will not show the video.''
   She called this an arrangement worked out after American's
surveys showed that its passengers complained that pictures of
airline crash scenes deeply disturbed them.
   She also said that American's decision to drop CBS was financial
and wasn't based on an editorial dispute. ``We didn't feel we were
earning enough profit from our agreement with CBS,'' she said.
   Acording to a source who asked not to be identified, CBS had
netted about $200,000 annually from its in-flight newscasts on
American.
   CBS for the past six years has provided American with daily
tapes of the ``CBS Morning News'' for daytime flights, said Berman,
whose division merchandises CBS News programs.
   Under American's guidelines, he said, CBS has pulled from
flights _ sometimes after consultation with American officials _
programs with reports of airline crashes or ``virtually anything
detrimental to the airlines.''
   CBS finally was told its contract wouldn't be renewed after it
balked at American's request to simply delete adverse airline news
``and deliver the remainder of the show,'' he said. ``We said no,
absolutely not.''
   Chamberlain characterized as a compromise the CNN agreement with
American, the nation's largest air carrier.
   There is no similar agreement, he said, with 11 other airlines,
including Delta and Quantas, that show CNN newscasts during their
flights.
   CBS serves Trans World Airlines, Continental Airlines and Japan
Air Lines with weekly summaries of the ``CBS Evening News,'' Berman
said, and none ever has asked CBS to edit out reports of airline
crashes.
   ``We deliver that show to them and they're responsible for
duplicating it and putting it on the airplanes,'' he says. It's up
to them, he adds, to decide whether to show any programs containing
airline crash reports.

   France has struck an agreement with European
mercenaries controlling the Comoros Islands for the soldiers of
fortune to leave and be replaced with French troops, the French
news agency reported Thursday.
   The French government had no comment on the reports.
   A South African diplomat said earlier Thursday the mercenaries
planned to leave but their commander was still negotiating terms
for his departure.
   The French and Belgian mercenaries, led by Frenchman Bob Denard,
took over the island nation off southeastern Africa after the Nov.
26 assassination of President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane. Denard
was widely believed to have killed the president but says he was
accidentally shot by his own bodyguard.
   Agence France-Presse quoted unidentified sources in the Comoros
as saying six French and Belgian mercenaries left Thursday night on
an Air France flight for Paris. Accompanying them were some wives
and children, the agency said.
   The 24 remaining mercenaries, including Denard, were to leave
Friday on a South African military transport plane for an unknown
destination, AFP said.
   The mercenaries controlled the islands through command of the
600-member presidential guard. However, some opponents took to the
streets to protest in Moroni, the capital.
   Denard said Thursday he wanted a formal transfer of power to the
French army before leaving, according to the Star newspaper of
Johannesburg.
   The South African paper said Denard demanded assurance there
would be no prosecution for the guards' activities; six months'
salary and an undisclosed additional payment, and press attendance
at a formal transfer of power.
   Denard said he was prepared to return to France, where he faces
arrest in a suit brought by relatives of mercenaries killed in an
unsuccessful coup Denard led in the West African country of Benin
in 1977.
   The French and South Africans, the Comoros' two largest aid
donors, have been negotiating for departure of the mercenaries.
   Four French naval vessels with 90 commandos are stationed just
outside Comoros territorial waters.
   On the French island of Mayotte about 170 miles to the
southwest, 300 marine parachute troops and seven military transport
planes await orders.
   Officially, the French military force is there to evacuate 1,600
French citizens who live on the islands. President Francois
Mitterrand says France has no intention of a military intervention.
   The Comoros gained independence from France in 1975.
   Denard helped engineer a 1975 coup that ousted Abdallah, then
led a 1978 coup that restored him to power. Denard and the
mercenaries have remained a leading force on the islands ever since.

   President Bush, lighting the National
Christmas Tree, said Thursday night the ``bells of freedom''
ringing across Eastern Europe have made this ``the Christmas that
we've awaited for 50 years.''
   Bush lifted his 3-year-old granddaughter Marshall Bush and held
her finger to the switch to illuminate the 35-foot blue spruce on
the frigid Ellipse behind the White House, decorated to represent
his theme of volunteerism, the ``thousand points of light.''
   At this Christmas season, Bush said:
   ``We've worked hard this year, all of us, all of you, to help
build a better America, to help make this a kinder and gentler
nation.''
   But, he added, ``there remains a world at need all around us.''
   ``From now on in America, `there's no room at the inn,' that's
simply not an acceptable answer,'' said the president. ``From now
on in America, any definition of a successful life must include
serving others.''
   ``This is the Christmas that we've awaited for 50 years. And
across Europe, east and west, 1989 is ending bright with the
prospect of a far better Christmastime than Europe has ever known;
a far better future the world dared to imagine,'' said Bush.
   ``Fifty winters have come and gone since darkness closed over
Europe in 1939,'' said Bush, but now the wall in Berlin has come
``tumbling down,'' and ``spring returned to Prague.''
   ``The glad sound you hear is not only the bells of Christmas,
but also the bells of freedom,'' Bush told the crowd from behind a
bullet-proof enclosure.
   In lighting the National Christmas Tree, Bush was continuing a
presidential tradition begun by Calvin Coolidge in 1923.
   Unlike his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, who used to throw the
switch from the White House, Bush and his wife, Barbara, attended
the ceremonies lighting the 35-foot tall Colorado blue spruce tree.
   The White House said later 12,000 people gathered in the
near-freezing temperatures to watch the ceremony.
   Bush took part in the tree lighting a few hours after he went on
a quick shopping trip.
   To the delight of holiday shoppers, Bush made a surprise visit
to a Sears, Roebuck store in Washington to buy gifts for his
grandchildren. Working with a gift list, he spent 30 minutes in the
store's children's clothing section, paying in cash.
   The National Christmas Tree is a living tree transplanted to its
permanent spot on the Ellipse in 1978. This year, it is hung with a
thousand white stars for Bush's ``thousand points of light.''
   The tree is also decorated with 4,000 red and blue lights that
fade out to show the white stars.
   The tree is surrounded by 57 smaller trees representing each
state and territory. They are the center of the Christmas Pageant
of Peace put on annually by a non-profit sponsor in cooperation
with the National Park Service.
   ``Today'' show weatherman Willard Scott, dressed as Santa,
presided over the ceremonies, and entertainers Loretta Lynn,
Marilyn McCoo, Billy Davis Jr. and Tommy Tune sang carols _
frequently into a dead microphone on a star-crossed sound system.
   The mike under Scott's Santa beard was the only one that worked
reliably, and Bush, before he headed back to the White House with
his wife Barbara, daughter-in-law Margaret Bush and granddaughter
Marshall, Bush leaned over to intone into Scott's beard, ``Santa,
you did a fine job.''

   The 15-nation Security Council voted
unanimously Thursday to extend the mandate of the U.N. Peacekeeping
Force in Cyprus for six more months, as it has done twice a year
since dispatching the force in 1964.
   Peace talks between the Greek and Turkish sectors of the
Mediterranean island are stalemated. U.N. peacekeepers separate the
feuding communities.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's latest report on
Cyprus said no progress on reuniting the island was made in the
last year.
   President George Vassiliou of Cyprus and Rauf Denktash, leader
of the breakaway Turkish sector in northern Cyprus, met separately
with Perez de Cuellar for talks this month but gave no sign of
budging.
   Denktash insists Cyprus must renounce any claim to governing the
Turkish Cypriots and recognize his government as legitimate.
Vassiliou reiterates his government's claim to authority over the
whole island.
   Turkey is the only country that recognizes Denktash's Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus.
   Vassiliou says Greek Cypriots must have the right to travel,
live and own property anywhere on the island. Denktash says the
minority Turkish community would lose its identity if it does not
have a protected enclave.
   ``For the Turkish Cypriots, the border stands for liberation and
security,'' the Turkish Cypriot envoy, Ozer Koray, told the council.
   Koray complained that the Vassiliou administration spent
``enormous sums'' to buy weapons and no mention was made of this in
Perez de Cuellar's report.
   Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish army invaded in 1974
following a short-lived, Greek-backed coup by supporters of union
with Greece.
   The Turks seized the northern one-third of the island. The
Turkish Cypriot minority proclaimed a breakaway republic there in
1983.

   Jurors returned 24 additional sealed verdicts
in the McMartin preschool molestation trial Thursday, bringing the
total of counts they have decided to 26 out of 65 charges.
   The jurors, who are scheduled to take a two-week vacation after
Friday's session, submitted 18 sealed envelopes to the court clerk
shortly after they began their day's deliberations.
   About an hour later, they sent out six more verdicts sealed in
envelopes, the court clerk said.
   The jury returned the first two verdicts on Nov. 28 and Dec. 5.
   The panel has been talking for a month and a half, debating
allegations that Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin
Buckey, 63, molested children at their family-owned nursery school
in Manhattan Beach. The Buckeys have steadfastly maintained their
innocence through five years of court proceedings including a
2{-year trial.
   Their case has become the longest and most costly criminal trial
in U.S. history.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders earlier yielded to juror
requests that he not announce any of their verdicts before they
leave for their Christmas vacation.
   They were worried that those who might disagree with their
initial decisions would pressure them regarding their remaining
verdicts during their vacation.

   Two teen-agers were killed Thursday when
security forces fired on rampaging Moslems separatists who were
celebrating the release of five jailed militants in a ransom deal,
police said.
   Shoaib Ali, deputy police inspector general of Jammu-Kashmir
state, said police fired in Sopore town when Moslems mobs attacked
a police station and freed some prisoners, and a 16-year-old boy,
Parvez Ahmed, was wounded fatally. Ali, contacted by telephone in
Srinagar, said hours later trouble spread to neighboring
Baramullah. Mobs attacked an army motor convoy and Mohammad Yusuf,
18, was killed when soldiers fired on the crowd in self-defense, he
said.
   At least 50 people, including eight police officers, were
injured in the two towns, Ali reported. He said curfews were
imposed and army patrols were on the streets in both towns to keep
order.
   Ali said the police fired in Sopore after baton charges and
teargas failed. Baramullah and Sopore are about 25 miles northwest
of Srinagar, where five Moslem militants of the separatist Kashmir
Liberation Front were released on Wednesday. The five were arrested
the past year for suspected subversion and secessionist activities,
but had not as yet been charged.
   In exchange, the front freed its hostage, Rubaiya Sayeed, a
medical intern and the youngest daughter of Home Minister Mufti
Mohammad Sayeed, a Kashmiri.
   Ms. Sayeed, 22, was kidnapped last Friday at gunpoint as she was
returning home from work at a Sringar hospital. Her abductors twice
threatened to kill her if their demands were not met.
   Sayeed is the first Moslem named as home minister, a post that
oversees police and internal security. The Dec. 5 appointment was
seen as part of new Prime Minister V.P. Singh's efforts to appease
India's Moslem minority, which bore the brunt of Hindu-Moslem riots
this fall that killed 300 people.

   A Connecticut woman imprisoned on terrorism
charges in El Salvador for 18 days denied Thursday that she hid
munitions in her yard, and said her ordeal has not diminished her
love for the Salvadoran people.
   ``I wish you all could know the Salvadoran people,'' Jennifer J.
Casolo, 28, said at a news conference at LaGuardia Airport, where
she arrived around 5 p.m. after a night in Miami.
   ``They are a people of so much faith and love and what they have
been through makes what I have been through seem this big,'' she
said, making a small fist.
   ``They deserve a country where they can eat, where their
children can go to school, where they don't have to worry about
being dragged away in the middle of the night,'' Casolo said.
   A church worker who moved to El Salvador in 1985, Casolo was
arrested Nov. 25 after authorities stormed her rented house in San
Salvador and unearthed dynamite, grenades and more than 20,000
rounds of ammunition from the back yard.
   A Salvadoran military judge dropped terrorism charges against
Casolo for lack of evidence, but Salvadoran President Alfredo
Cristiani said he remained convinced of her guilt. Salvadoran
officials said a rebel had told them where the arms were buried.
   Casolo maintains she was framed.
   ``Maybe those weapons were there. Maybe a Salvadoran guerrilla
tipped them off ... but there's just as much possibility that they
beat the hell out of someone to get them to say it _ and excuse my
language,'' Casolo said.
   She said that during her imprisonment she underwent several
interrogations, including one in which she was blindfolded and
forced to stand for a long period.
   She said that at night she couldn't sleep because of the sounds
of others being beaten.
   She said her female interrogator told her: ``Here you have no
rights.''
   ``Then she tells me she has permission to do with me what she
wants and she doesn't want to be dishonest _ (that) she has treated
people badly before,'' Casolo recalled.
   She was held in Ilopango for eight days of her 18-day detention.
She said the prison was surrounded by military headquarters and she
was afraid of being taken out by the soldiers.
   She said that when soldiers stormed her house, she shouted,
``Who could hate me this much?''
   She added, ``Maybe it's because if you could discredit me, you
could discredit the work of the church. ... I wanted to stay there
and be part of the construction of peace. The deportation broke my
heart because it means I can't go back.''
   She blasted Bush administration officials who earlier had
indicated they believed she might be guilty. She said she told the
Salvadorans she was ``innocent until proven guilty, but I didn't
know my own government representatives don't care about that same
right.''
   Casolo urged an end to U.S. military aid to El Salvador and
expressed concern for what she said are more than 1,000 political
prisoners still held in El Salvador.
   On Thursday, Salvadoran police raided the home of the lawyer who
had defended her, Salvador Ibarra, and arrested his sister, Vilma,
and two others. In New York, Casolo asked that the same sort of
support shown for her be shown for Ms. Ibarra.
   Casolo, who is fluent in Spanish, worked for Christian Education
Seminars, a San Antonio-based ecumenical group that organizes
visits to El Salvador for Americans, including members of Congress.
   The Rev. Dan Long of Christian Education Seminars, accompanied
Casolo on the flights from San Salvador to New York.
   Greeting Casolo at the airport were five classmates from her
alma mater, Brandeis University, class of 1983. Also on hand were
two Baptist ministers and one Methodist minister.
   At her hometown of Thomaston, Conn., where her parents awaited
her return. Her mother, Audrey, called her release an early
Christmas present. ``Today is like the day before the wedding,''
said Mrs. Casolo said. ``You're happy and hoping for everything.''
   Church activists often have been harassed by the Salvadoran
government, which accuses them of aiding left-wing guerillas in the
country's decade-long civil war. Government troops are widely
blamed for the slaughter of six Jesuit priests last month, when
guerrillas began a major new offensive against the government.
   She said the soldiers who stormed her house did not let her see
what they were doing in the backyard.
   Asked how the weapons came to be in her yard, she said, ``I
don't know if it was there, if they put it there or if someone else
put it there and I don't think I'll ever know.''
   Casolo flew from San Salvador to Miami Wednesday night and then
from Miami to New York City on Thursday.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who had lobbied for Casolo's
release, sent a car to LaGuardia and accompanied her back to her
hometown of Thomaston, where about 500 people braved freezing
weather to give her a warm homecoming.
   ``Thanks for coming out,'' she told the crowd, her voice choked
with emotion. ``The New York press did not overwhelm me, but you
guys are overwhelming me.''
   Her father also tearfully thanked the townspeople for their
prayers and letters. ``You've really made this the merriest
Christmas we've ever had. I hope you will have the same,'' John
Casolo said, overcome with emotion.
   Ms. Casolo planned a private reunion with her mother, Audrey
Casolo, after the official greeting on the Town Green.
   ``It was something that was something that was just kind of
personal to her,'' said Susan Abbott, one of Jennifer's closest
friends. ``She didn't want it to be all over the TVs and newspapers
when she woke up in the morning.''
   A plywood sign erected on the green read ``Welcome Home
Jennifer. We Love You,'' and at the entrance to her mother's house,
two ``Welcome Home'' banners flew, one in English and the other in
Spanish.
   A large purple bow, bearing Jennifer's name in gold letters,
hung on the front door of the Thomaston Congregational Church,
where hundreds of town residents gathered Dec. 1 to pray for her
release.
   ``Our prayers here in Thomaston have been answered,'' said First
Selectman Eugene McMahon. ``This crisis has served to unite all the
people of this community in a common purpose. Indeed, we all can
enjoy a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.''

<HEAD>Alleged Collaborator Axed to Death in Occupied West Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Masked Palestinians shot and axed to death a
suspected collaborator Thursday in the crowded Casbah, or old
market, in the West Bank city of Nablus, Arab reporters said.
   An army official confirmed the death and said it was being
investigated by police.
   The slaying was the first of an alleged collaborator in Nablus
since Dec. 1 when army troops shot and killed four members of a
radical group called the Black Panthers, which had been blamed for
killing 16 people on suspicion they cooperated with Israel.
   Following those deaths, the army announced through loudspeakers
that citizens no longer need fear attacks from the Black Panthers.
However, masked youths have appeared on the streets since, chanting
that the group's members would still punish collaborators.
   Thursday's death raised to 156 the number of Palestinians slain
by fellow Arabs as alleged collaborators during the two-year-old
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   At least 631 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during
the revolt, and 43 Israelis also have died.
   In Nablus, Palestinian witnesses said several masked
Palestinians led the victim, with his hands tied behind his back,
through the narrow streets of the Casbah.
   One of the masked men struck the victim in the head with an ax
and another fired six or seven shots into his head, chest and
stomach, the witnesses told reporters.
   The victim was identified only as a 30-year-old man believed to
be from the nearby town of Tulkarem. Arab reporters said he was
kidnapped Wednesday along with two other men who are still missing.
   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, seven Palestinians were shot and
wounded in clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing youths in
the Bureij and Shati refugee camps and the town of Rafah, Arab
reporters said.
   In the Golan Heights, police fired tear gas to break up several
small pro-Syrian demonstrations on the eighth anniversary of
Israel's annexation of the heights following the area's capture
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Schools and some businesses were closed by a general strike
ordered by activists of the Druse sect, an offshoot of Islam. A
Syrian flag was seen flying in Majdal Shams, the area's largest
town, and Druse on the Syrian side of the border held up signs
supporting the Palestinian uprising.
   Police said 11 Druse were arrested in Majdal Shams during the
protests.

<HEAD>New Anti-Smog Proposal Calls For Cleaner Cars By 1994</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unprecedented anti-smog proposals introduced
Thursday call for automakers and fuel industries to produce
super-clean cars for California by the year 2000, a goal some
carmakers call impossible.
   Southern California air quality officials view the proposed
state regulations, designed to reduce statewide auto emissions by
as much as two-thirds, as a crucial part in their efforts to meet
federal clean air standards by the year 2007.
   California motorists would be the first in the nation able to
switch to low-polluting cars under the plan, which was formally
unveiled at a meeting of the California Air Resources Board.
   All fuel sources, including new gasolines, methanol, compressed
natural gas, propane, ethanol and electricity, would be permitted
as long as vehicles meet stricter emissions standards, officials
said.
   The resources board, in calling for the standards, seeks to
stretch to new lengths its longtime campaign to force automakers
and fuel companies to advance their anti-pollution technology.
   ``In the past we have regulated the car industry and the fuel
industry,'' board spokesman Bill Sessa said Thursday. ``This is
really an effort to regulate them at the same time. It will require
an uncommon amount of cooperation between car and fuel makers and
other energy suppliers to reach the goals we are targeting.''
   No action was taken during the hearing, held at the downtown
state office building, as the board begins gathering reaction from
various groups, including the Western States Petroleum Association,
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern California Gas Co. and Ford and
General Motors and others.
   The board will review the draft proposal, which was formulated
by staff after consultation workshops with the auto and fuel
industries, Sessa said.
   A final draft of the pollution-cutting plan was expected by
July, with a board vote possible in September.
   The proposal calls for oil and auto companies to join forces to
develop new engines and fuels that produce fewer contaminating
emissions.
   The plan also calls for about 10 percent of all new cars sold in
California each year between 1994 and 1996 to be cleaner-fuel
models.
   In 1997, one-quarter of new cars would have to operate on the
cleaner fuels. The quota would increase to half of cars sold in
1998, and to 98 percent in 2000.
   Automakers have complained that cars using methanol cost
hundreds of dollars more to operate than those using gasoline.
   ``There are many ways to meet the standards, through a
combination of things, such as a superior grade of gasoline with
advanced catalyst systems, or perhaps with lower technology engines
coupled with cleaner burning alternative fuels such as methanol or
natural gas,'' Sessa said.
   But citing uncertainties in developing new technologies, auto
company officials said before Thursday's meeting they planned to
ask the agency to postpone its compliance deadlines.
   ``This is going at such an unprecedented pace. My fear is that
they will adopt rules that can't be achieved,'' said Mike Schwarz,
Ford Motor Co.'s manager of emissions control in Detroit.
   Schwarz said cleaner-fuel cars could be introduced to state
consumers in 1994 or 1995. But he said the auto industry needs at
least until 1997 to meet any quotas.
   Sessa, however, said the deadlines were reasonable.
   ``There will be much more discussion before a firm proposal, but
we're confiden t that these deadlines could be met, based on
testing of prototype cars ,'' he said.
   Some 1 billion gallons of the cleaner fuel would have to be
marketed in 1997, increasing to about 11 billion gallons in 2006,
according to the plan.

<HEAD>Flamboyant Drug Dealer Gets 35 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 34-year-old man who federal prosecutors say
made millions in the drug trade and spent it lavishly on cars, a
yacht and real estate was sentenced Thursday to 35 years in prison.
   Thomas Mickens, who liked to call himself Tony Montana after the
mobster in the movie ``Scarface,'' was convicted in federal court
June 28 of conspiracy to distribute narcotics, money laundering and
tax evasion.
   At the time of his conviction, U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney
called him one of the largest drug distributors in Queens,
personally netting $2.5 million from January 1984 through May 1988.
   Sentence was handed down by U.S. District Judge Thomas C. Platt.
   Among his assets seized by the authorities were a customized
Rolls-Royce worth $100,000, a 38-foot yacht worth $48,000 and a
$750,000 home. He owned 17 cars and 18 pieces of real estate, the
prosecution said.
   In 1987 alone, the prosecution said, he spent more than $1
million on cars and property, not counting living expenses.
   His drug operation was headquarterd in Queens, and he garnered
favor in the neighborhood by sponsoring local basketball teams, the
prosecution said.

   Opposition candidate Patricio Aylwin
trounced Gen. Augusto Pinochet's former finance minister Thursday
in elections to end the right-wing military president's 16-year
rule.
   Official election results from 93 percent of the country's 7.5
million registered voters showed Aylwin with 3.58 million votes, or
55.2 percent, enough for an absolute majority.
   Interior Ministry returns had Hernan Buchi, the former finance
minister credited with designing a policy of economic growth and
low inflation from 1985 until May, finishing a distant second with
1.9 million votes, or 29.4 percent.
   At midnight, Interior Minister Carlos Caceres formally
recognized Aylwin's victory and pledged the government will abide
by the result.
   Under Chilean law, Aylwin is to take office for four years
beginning March 11.
   Earlier Thursday evening, Buchi conceded defeat, declaring, ``We
have returned to democracy. Mr. Patricio Aylwin has been elected
president of the republic by the people of Chile.''
   Motorists honked their horns in celebration and supporters of
the 71-year-old Aylwin, a moderate Christian Democrat, rushed into
the streets of this capital to hail the victory. Fireworks dotted
the sky and lines of flag-waving citizens crammed the main
thoroughfares early Friday.
   On one large white banner was painted a portrait of ex-President
Salvador Allende, a Marxist whose elected 3-year-old government was
toppled by Pinochet in a 1973 coup. The banner quoted one of the
final statements of Allende, who died during the coup: ``I have
faith in Chile and its future.''
   In a victory speech delivered shortly after midnight (10 p.m.
EST Thursday) from a downtown hotel balcony, Aylwin declared: ``The
people of Chile have taken their future destiny back into their own
hands.''
   He then asked the crowd to return peacefully to their homes and
prepare for an official street celebrations Friday afternoon.
   A long-shot third candidate, populist businessman Francisco
Errazuriz, also conceded defeat, saying, ``Mr. Aylwin has won an
absolute majority.'' Errazuriz had 998,000 votes or 15 percent,
according to the count. There were 114,000 null and blank ballots,
the Ministry said late Thursday.
   In his first public reaction, Pinochet applauded the
peacefulness and normality of the voting, and attributed the margin
of victory to a better organized opposition.
   One serious voting day incident was reported in this nation of
12 million people: police said a gunman fled after killing a
23-year-old officer guarding a polling station in a working-class
district in southern Santiago. No details were given.
   Voters also elected 38 Senators and 120 House of Deputies
members, but results were not immediately available. Scattered
returns reported by local radio and television networks showed the
opposition coalition leading in most of the races.
   The Senate also will include up to 10 members appointed by,
among others, the president, Supreme Court and National Security
Council.
   While a funereal atmosphere was evident at Buchi campaign
headquarters, across town Aylwin campaign official Enrique Krauss
said with a smile, ``The results show the unquestionable victory of
Patricio Aylwin.''
   Aylwin, who represented an alliance of 17 centrist and leftist
parties, had been heavily favored in most pre-election surveys.
   The presidential count included returns from all of Chile's 12
official regions. In only one, the southern 11th region, did Aylwin
win less than in absolute majority _ 46 percent.
   With an absolute majority, Aylwin avoided a two-candidate
runoff, which the constitution required if no nominee won more than
50 percent of the total.
   Buchi, 40, was backed by pro-government parties. Errazuriz, a
47-year-old millionaire, had been expected to run a distant third.
   Pinochet and other top military officials claimed responsibility
Thursday for leading Chile back to democracy. It was a model in
Latin America before 1973, and economically has done well in recent
years exporting wine, copper, fish, fruit and lumber.
   Aylwin, surrounded by bodyguards supplied by the government,
voted early at a school near his home in Santiago, and was cheered
by bystanders as he pushed through a crush of journalists.
   When Buchi voted, he was greeted by Aylwin backers who taunted
him with chants of ``Aylwin, president!'' He did not respond.
   Voting is mandatory in Chile and people failing to vote can be
fined $95. For nearly half of the 7.5 million registered voters,
this was their first real election.
   Some people arrived before dawn at the polling places and waited
in lines that stretched for blocks to receive their three paper
ballots: one each for president, Senate and House of Deputies.
   The peaceful atmosphere mirrored that of October 1988, when
Chileans rejected a referendum proposal that Pinochet lead the
country until 1997, forcing him to schedule elections.
   Hundreds of U.S. and European observers are in the country,
although none have been officially recognized by the government. It
allowed them in as tourists, saying no foreign supervision of the
vote was needed.
   Pinochet complained bitterly Thursday about their presence,
saying they came ``to control the pesos they gave to politicians.''
   Pinochet's right-wing administration frequently has accused the
political opposition of selling out to foreign political parties
and pro-democracy groups that donated money.
   Pinochet, meeting with reporters at the presidential palace,
said he was angered by two things: ``One, because they come to
control the pesos they gave to politicians and political parties.
Second, they come to meddle believing that there will be
irregularities, bad things, and this isn't so.''
   Among the polling stations Thursday was National Stadium in
Santiago, which became a symbol of political repression after the
1973 coup. The military penned up thousands of dissidents in the
stadium and, according to human rights groups, killed or tortured
many.
   Similar roundups occurred elsewhere in Chile.
   Although he must step down as president, Pinochet has said he
will retain command of the 60,000-man army. A provision of the
constitution written by his regime prohibits the new president from
dismissing him until 1998.

<UNK>Personal Attacks Mark Debate, Final Week of Brazilian Presidential
Campaign</UNK>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential candidates Luis
Inacio da Silva and Fernando Collor de Mello traded accusations and
personal barbs Thursday in the final TV debate of a bare-knuckle
campaign before the Dec. 16 election.
   Commentators labeled the 2{-hour encounter a draw in which
neither candidate scored heavily off the other.
   The two men are virtually deadlocked in nationwide polls and the
campaign turned into a series of personal attacks over the final
week.
   Collor de Mello called his socialist rival ``intolerant'' and
``backward.'' He said da Silva's radical Workers Party would stir
national strikes, land invasions and economic chaos if da Silva is
elected.
   Da Silva called Collor de Mello ``emotionally unstable'' and
tried to depict him as a ``member of the dominant, archaic upper
class'' and the new face of the right.
   Analysts say the campaign turned ugly this week as opinion polls
indicated the race was tightening.
   An opinion poll published Thursday had Collor de Mello clinging
to a one percentage point lead over da Silva. Two weeks ago, Collor
de Mello had a 15 point lead.
   Earlier Thursday, Miriam Cordeiro, the mother of da Silva's
illegitimate 15-year-old daughter Lurian, made further intimate
accusations against him in a Collor de Mello TV campaign spot on
national TV.
   She said da Silva wanted to continue their affair after he was
married, but she refused.
   Earlier this week, Ms. Cordeiro called da Silva a racist and
said he offered pay for her to get an abortion.
   Da Silva says he had an affair with Ms. Cordeiro after his first
wife died in 1969.
   Ms. Cordeiro said her testimony was spontaneous and that she
``didn't get a cent'' for the interview. But a former aide of
Collor de Mello said his National Reconstruction Party paid her
$23,000 for her statements.
   The Supreme Electoral Court granted da Silva the right to reply
to the charges Thursday during Collor de Mello's assigned TV time.
   ``I never thought anyone could sink so low _ neither my
adversary, nor this woman,'' da Silva said. ``If I erred, I want
the people to judge me.''
   His camp attributed the attacks to desperation by Collor de
Mello.
   Collor de Mello finished first in the first-round election on
Nov. 15, with 28 percent of the votes, Da Silva was second with 16
percent. Because neither had a majority, the two went to a runoff.
   A new poll released Thursday by the DataFolha institute
indicated Collor de Mello had 46 percent of the vote and da Silva
45 percent, with a margin of error of 2 percent.
   DataFolha interviewed 5,250 people in their homes on Tuesday and
Wednesday. Da Silva, a former lathe operator and union president,
was widely considered a long-shot to reach the presidency.
   Collor de Mello, a former congressman and governor of tiny
Alagoas state, has been the front-runner since April. His promises
to clean up corrupt government and his sharp attacks on President
Jose Sarney were popular with poor Brazilians, who make up most of
the 82 million voters.
   The last free election for president was in 1960, when Janio
Quadros was elected. The armed forces took power in a 1964 coup and
ruled until 1985.
   Sarney, a civilian, was chosen by an Electoral College
controlled by the military regime.

<HEAD>Top U.N. Official Sees Namibia Independent in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Namibia will probably become independent
in March after 75 years of South African rule, Martti Ahtisaari,
the senior U.N. official supervising the territory's independence
process, said Thursday.
   Ahtisaari, special representative in Namibia for
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, told reporters that
political parties in Namibia are making swift progress in drafting
a constitution for the new nation.
   ``There is the clear desire by all the parties to get this
exercise done early.''
   ``If we are very lucky, they might tie up the constitution
during January'' and then set a date for independence, he added.
   Asked how soon Namibia could gain independence, he replied:
``The general feeling is sometime in March.''
   Ahtisaari has been supervising Namibia's moves toward
independence since April. The U.N. team's mission is due to expire
at the end of March.
   The team includes 4,650 military observers and 1,500 police
supervisors.
   Ahtisaari also was asked when Namibia, also known as South-West
Africa, might join the United Nations as an independent country. He
said he hoped that would happen by September.
   A newly elected Constituent Assembly must adopt the constitution
by a two-thirds majority before setting a target date for
independence.
   Ahtisaari said he saw no stumbling blocks in drafting the
constitution.
   Ahtisaari said the process gained momentum when the leading
party, the South-West Africa People's Organization, declared in
November that it wanted to enshrine freedom of the press and
assembly as well as principles of multiparty democracy in the
constitution.
   SWAPO had conducted a 23-year guerrilla war against South
African authorities in the territory, and some Namibians feared it
would seek a one-party, socialist state.
   Ahtisaari was in New York to consult with senior U.N. officials
while the General Assembly held a Special Session on Apartheid, the
South African system of racial discrimination. He said he expected
to return to Namibia's capital, Windhoek, on Sunday.
   South Africa captured the territory from Germany in World War I.
In 1966, the General Assembly canceled a mandate from the League of
Nations, the U.N. precursor, granting South Africa the right to
administer Namibia.
   Last year, South Africa agreed to cooperate with the U.N. plan
for Namibia's transition to independence when Cuba agreed to
simultaneously withdraw its 50,000 troops from neighboring Angola.

<HEAD>Andrei Sakharov, Symbol of Soviet Dissidence, Dead at 68</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY75, LaserColor NY77</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTWOOD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei Sakharov, the Nobel Peace
Prize-winning physicist who became a symbol of Soviet dissidence,
has died at age 68, his relatives reported Thursday.
   Sakharov, a human rights leader who later was elected to the
Soviet Parliament formed under President Mikhail Gorbachev and
became one of its leading voices, died in Moscow, relatives said.
   Liza Semyonov, 34, the daughter-in-law of Sakharov's wife,
Yelena Bonner, said Bonner called about 6 p.m. Thursday to notify
the family of Sakharov's death.
   Ms. Semyonov lives with her husband, Alexey Semyonov, in the
Boston suburb of Westwood. Bonner's daughter, Tatiana Yankelovich,
lives in nearby Newton.
   ``I don't know what more to say,'' Ms. Semyonov said. ``She
didn't give any more details.''
   Attempts to reach Sakharov's home in Moscow by telephone were
unsuccessful. Sakharov had suffered from angina, but during a visit
to the United States in December 1988, doctors at Massachusetts
General Hospital determined he did not need heart surgery or a
pacemaker after cardiovascular tests.
   Sakharov was a top Soviet physicist and helped developed its
hydrogen bomb in the 1950s, but became a dissident leader in the
1970s.
   Sakharov's clashes with four Kremlin leaderships over human
rights, foreign policy and the morality of the nuclear weaponry he
helped develop as a physicist sent him into forced exile in the
Soviet city of Gorky, about 250 miles from Moscow, in 1980.
   He was recalled in 1986 by Gorbachev, and swiftly took a leading
role in urging the Soviet leader to follow through on Gorbachev's
twin policies of perestroika, or restructuring, and glasnost, or
openness.
   His activism continued almost until his death. On Tuesday, he
engaged in an angry exchange with Gorbachev in the Parliament over
the party's monopoly on political power.
   His campaigns on behalf of disarmament and human rights won him
the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, and he steadfastly argued that without
international respect for human rights there could be no guarantee
of peace.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk read a statement praising
Sakharov as ``a historical figure who will be long remembered for
his human rights efforts in the Soviet Union. His voice was an
important dimension in the contemporary changes under way in Soviet

   A tractor-trailer carrying unknown
hazardous materials overturned Thursday on the interstate highway
circling Washington, forcing the evacuation of about 100 residents
and snarling traffic for hours during and after the evening rush
hour.
   The trailer had picked up more than two dozen chemicals in
Richmond, Va. and was bound for Harrisburg, Pa., when it lost a
tire and collided with a car at about 5 p.m, Montgomery County fire
officials said, quoting the unidentified driver.
   Seven people were injured in the chain reaction of collisions
that followed, and two of the four admitted to Suburban Hospital
were reported in serious condition.
   Traffic remained backed up for several miles at 10:30 p.m.,
officials said. Officials took the evacuated residents to a nearby
high school.
   Firefighters were unsure Thursday night exactly how the
chemicals were contained in the trailer, and had not tried to open
it or remove it from the road where Interstate 270 intersects with
the Capital Beltway, Interstate 495 at that point northwest of
Washington.
   Firefighters said it was important to know how the cargo was
packaged and positioned before they tried to enter the trailer,
which was on its side. They considered the situation so dangerous
that they retreated to more than 1,000 feet from the accident.
   Officials studied a tape made from a helicopter by a news camera
crew from WJLA-TV in an effort to determine whether the chemicals
were leaking and the best way they could be removed.
   The truck is owned by St. Johnsbury Trucking Co. of Holliston,
Mass.

<TEXT>
   Christine Eckermann remembers that in East
Germany, ``you had to tie three Christmas trees together to make a
decent one.''
   Eckermann, her friend, Uwe Buschard, and her six children have
few regrets about coming West a month ago.
   In good spirits, they talk about how they'll bring Christmas to
their temporary home: two rooms in a shabby, former hotel
requisitioned for refugees by the Red Cross.
   Eckermann and Buschard, both 30, don't have much spare room in a
roughly 218-square-foot space they share with three of the children
at night.
   But amid the beds, baby crib, scuffed hotel chairs and
bargain-basement wardrobe, there will be a tree with ornaments and
their presents.
   ``We're going put in a Christmas touch,'' Eckermann said,
sitting in the shabby building in a central West Berlin residential
neighborhood, where about 50 refugee families live. ``The Red Cross
also will be giving out presents.''
   ``I'm not going to be homesick,'' said the former factory
worker. Her friend agreed.
   A few blocks away, West Berlin's Kurfuerstendamm shopping street
is aglow in ornamental lights, a lavish display of wares for West
Germany's traditional season of expensive presents and big family
dinners.
   Though Eckermann and Buschard may not be top-notch Western
consumers yet, he has landed an electrical engineering job with a
monthly take-home pay of about $1,100. Apart from food and lodging
provided by the Red Cross, the couple also benefits from West
Germany's generous family support programs and Eckermann's alimony
payments.
   ``I assume if we pay the Red Cross something for room and board,
it won't be very much. Otherwise, we're doing fine,'' she said.
   Christmas Eve has always been a family feast for Eckermann and
she's confident it will remain that way. Under East Germany's new
travel freedom, she said she expects her mother to come over for
the celebration.
   Eckermann and Buschard packed up the children and moved to West
Berlin the day after the Communist authorities opened the Berlin
Wall on Nov. 9.
   She and Buschard, who divorced his first wife in 1984, had a
four-room apartment in suburban East Berlin, but they were not
happy.
   ``It was on the sixth floor, with no elevator, no balcony,
cracks in the walls _ just the way they build in the east,'' she
said.
   ``No playground, just other apartment buildings all around. I
waited seven years to get that apartment.''
   A strong Protestant tradition has survived in East Germany
despite 40 years of Communist control, with Christmas marked in
public and private as it is in West Germany.
   But it's not quite the same, Buschard said.
   ``By now, stores (in East Germany) don't have presents anymore.
A little chocolate Santa Claus costs six or seven marks ($3.35 to
$3.95), then they later rewrap them to sell as Easter bunnies,'' he
said.
   ``Packaging for toys is so gray over there,'' added Eckermann.
   Eckermann's children _ three boys and two girls aged 2{ to 14 _
are not shy about their wishes. Six-month-old Samira, the couple's
first child, sleeps peacefully in her crib.
   Ronny, 11, sporting a New York Yankees baseball cap, wants a
bicycle. ``Christmas will definitely be better this year,'' he said.
   Asked why, he replied: ``Because we're in the West. That's what
everyone says, anyway.''
   Actually, Eckermann wants to give Ronny his second remote
control toy car for Christmas. Portable cassette players are among
the other gift ideas she is contemplating.
   The move was tougher on the children than the adults, she said.
   ``They left all their toys over there. So when they find one
here in the hall, they won't let go.''
   Nearly 320,000 East Germans have left their country this year.
Paired with massive pro-democracy protests, the exodus forced major
political changes in East Germany, including the opening of its
Western borders.
   In West Berlin, 100 miles inside East Germany, the arrival of
50,000 East Germans has sharpened an existing housing crisis. About
28,000 of the refugees are in emergency shelters, including school
gymnasiums and trade fair halls.
   ``We know how hard it is to find an apartment, especially with
six children. We just have to deal with that,'' Eckermann said.
``But we'll stay in this hotel as long as necessary, even if it's
two years.''
   ``I'd rather go to the jungle than back to East Germany,'' she
said. ``Maybe if everything changes, but not as long as the Berlin
Wall stands.''

<TEXT>
   As many as 300,000 Soviet Jews are expected to
flee in the next three years to Israel, where the prospect has
exacerbated some deep-set ethnic tensions.
   A bitter debate over resettlement costs is pitting Soviet
Ashkenazis _ Jews of European descent _ against Sephardis, those of
North African and Middle Eastern origin. The Sephardis complain
that the new immigrants may further block poor Israelis from moving
up the social scale.
   Although the argument has been spearheaded by Sephardi
activists, it appears to enjoy some support among other Israelis.
   On radio call-in shows and in letters to newspapers, some
Israelis have complained about absorption costs and even suggested
that immigrants be put in tent camps, like the Jews who arrived in
the 1950s.
   The dispute reached its peak last week when a Sephardi militant,
Yamin Suissa, announced he sent a telegram to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and President Bush, asking them to curb the Soviet Jewish
exodus.
   ``I don't see people accepting these immigrants with a bear
hug,'' Suissa said. ``People still have a feeling in their guts
towards the immigrants and I'm expressing exactly what they are
feeling.''
   Suissa's followers and other Sephardi groups held a protest
outside Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's home, handing out soup to
the poor and demanding that Israel deal with social problems before
encouraging more immigrants.
   An angry Natan Sharansky _ a human rights champion who spent
nine years in Soviet labor camps before immigrating in 1986 _ sent
a letter to Shamir, saying Suissa's statements ``contradicted ...
the very idea of immigration.''
   Another former Soviet prisoner, Yosef Begun, said: ``You know
that people sat in jail and suffered to come to the land of Israel,
so it is sad for us to hear such ideas, that the Israeli people
don't need the Jews of Russia.''
   Others complain that Suissa's ideas run against Israel's Law of
Return, which promises citizenship to any Jew.
   The wave of immigration is expected because of Soviet ethnic
unrest and economic troubles, as well as Moscow's liberalized
emigration policy and tighter U.S. immigration rules.
   In January-November of this year, 62,540 Jews left the Soviet
Union, of which only 9,120 came to Israel, according to the
quasi-governmental Jewish Agency here.
   Hoping to draw 300,000 Soviet Jews in the next three years,
Israel has announced a $3 billion resettlement plan. The government
wants to gather one-third of that sum from donations and loans,
mostly from the United States.
   That large sum has frightened many Israelis.
   ``Today, when we have half a million citizens living in poverty,
the state must maintain the balance, absorb new immigrants but also
improve living conditions of old immigrants,'' said Elie
Ben-Menachem, a Parliament member of Sephardi descent from the
center-left Labor Party.
   Ben-Menachem, speaking to 200 activists from such neighborhoods,
referred to figures showing that 487,939 of Israel's 4,477 million
citizens were living in poverty in 1988, with a monthly income of
less than $390 per couple.
   Marko Ohaion, head of a residents' committee in a working-class
neighborhood of Beersheba, told the daily Yediot Ahronot that
unless the government deals with the 8.8 percent unemployment rate
in addition to absorbing immigrants, ``the tension will become
unbearable.''
   Sephardi activists tend to see the problem as an ethnic issue.
At a rally of Sephardic neighborhood leaders, shouts arose that
``Ashkenazim need immigration to become a majority,'' the daily
Haaretz reported.
   Sephardi Jews, including third-generation immigrants, constitute
up to 55 percent of Israel's Jewish population.
   About 20 percent of Sephardi Jews are considered to be poor,
said Yohanan Peres, a Tel Aviv University expert on Israeli ethnic
conflicts.
   He noted that anti-immigrant emotions surfaced in the 1970s as
immigrants began receiving improved housing loans and could
purchase many tax-free goods. Now, he said, the feelings are even
stronger

   Yellowstone National
Park, finishing its first full year since it was swept by wildfires
in 1987, drew more tourists during the first 11 months than in any
previous full year, park statistics show.
   Park spokeswoman Marsha Karle said 2,660,346 visitors entered
the park between Jan. 1 and Nov. 30, toppling the 1978 tourism
record of 2,623,141 for 12 months.
   The number of tourists will continue to grow this month.
Yellowstone's winter season begins Friday, when facilities open at
Old Faithful and park roads open to snowmobiles. The Mammoth Hotel
near Gardiner opens Dec. 21.
   A total of 899,259 vehicles were logged in the park this year,
compared to 749,539 in 1988 and 880,545 in 1987, park statistics
show.

   Lindsay Crosby, a son of the late crooner
Bing Crosby, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,
the county coroner's office confirmed Wednesday.
   The report supported earlier conclusions that Crosby, 51, had
committed suicide Monday at a Calabasas condominium where he was
staying while undergoing treatment for alcoholism.
   Coroner's Deputy Claude Boucher confirmed the cause-of-death
finding from Crosby's autopsy.
   A family friend said the suicide came after Crosby learned his
inheritance had run out. Assembled 45 years ago, it was based on
investments in crude oil, a market that has softened considerably
in the past few years.
   Lindsay Crosby, who lived with his wife, Susan, and two of his
four sons in suburban Sherman Oaks, was the youngest of the four
brothers born to Bing and Dixie Lee Crosby.

   Cartagena, a port city 680 miles north of Bogota, is located in

assassinations since Colombian President Virgilio Barco declared
war on the drug traffickers three months ago.

   The aerospace industry is marking record sales
but is ``braced for heavy weather'' in future years with the
prospect of peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union, an industry
leader says.
   Aerospace industries are likely to decline in sales volume over
the next decade, according to a year-end industry report by the
Aerospace Industries Association.
   This year's record sales are due primarily to delivery of
military aircraft and related equipment that were ordered in
previous years and to a boom in commercial airliner sales,
association president Don Fuqua said Wednesday.
   Long-range declines are expected as a result of the prospect of
peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union and predicted defense
budget cuts, Fuqua said. Much of the decline will be offset by
gains in civil aviation and commercial space programs, but the
overall result will be a modest decline, he said.

   House Democrats complain that the White House
is more prepared to dispatch high-level officials across the world
to reach out to the leaders of China than to send one official to
Capitol Hill to explain the action.
   Members of a House Foreign Affairs panel had sought the
testimony of Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger who,
over the weekend, accompanied National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft to China.
   When the White House blocked Eagleburger's appearance on
Wednesday, Democrats accused the administration of ``hiding out''
to avoid embarrassment.
   ``It seems the Bush administration is willing to send Mr.
Eagleburger 6,000 miles to apologize to the Chinese leaders but it
was not willing to send him two miles to Capitol Hill to explain
this action to Congress,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.

<TEXT>
   Although she is the product of the
most liberal of Western schooling, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
still covers her head in public and never shakes hands with men _
in keeping with Islamic fundamentalism.
   Pakistani women's rights activists say that in her first year in
power, the Moslem world's only female government leader is
kowtowing to a small but powerful religious right.
   The ascent to power late last year of her populist Pakistan
People's Party raised women's hopes for equality in this
male-dominated Moslem nation of 109 million people.
   But rights advocates now say those hopes have sunk into
frustration _ even fear.
   ``At the beginning we felt there was so much to look forward
to,'' said Najma Seddique, a feminist and human rights activist.
``It's very sad. She's got strength she's not using. She's playing
by the traditionalists' rules.''
   The 36-year-old prime minister, educated at Radcliffe College in
Cambridge, Mass., and at Oxford in England, wears expansive tent
dresses and blanket-like shawls, the acceptable garments of Moslem
women.
   Her mother and an aunt arranged her marriage in 1987 to one of
Pakistan's leading industrialists, Asif Zardari. She claims to have
never seen Zardari before a pre-engagement family meeting, in line
with orthodox Islamic tradition.
   ``Benazir Bhutto is trying to be more Islamic than the mullahs
(Moslem clerics), but you can't be,'' insisted Sameena Ahmed, a
long-time member of one of Pakistan's rare women's rights groups.
``It's not just disappointment. We're scared.''
   Ahmed said no matter what concessions Ms. Bhutto makes, the
fundamentalists will never concede her right to rule.
   ``What are they going to give her? Not support,'' she said.
   Feminists acknowledge that achieving equal rights for women
means debunking some age-old traditions.
   ``Women can be bartered, sold, married off against their will,''
said Seddique, the feminist. ``And if they are found in the company
of a man who isn't their husband or relative, they can be killed.
They only have to be accused.''
   Rape victims in Pakistan seldom bring charges against their
attackers, out of fear of being accused of willingly having illicit
sex, which is punishable by stoning to death.
   Feminists and human rights activists say this charge, which is
called ``Zina,'' is the legal equivalent of ``she asked for it.''
   To disprove the charge, a woman needs to find four men to
testify that she was sexually assaulted, or get the rapist to
confess. A woman's testimony, even the victim's, doesn't count.
   Nahida Mahboob Elahi, president of a women lawyers' group, said
a 16-year-old girl was recently beaten and raped, then charged with
willingly having sex.
   She spent two years in prison and gave birth to the rapist's
child.
   ``Until today nothing is done; we are very worried,'' Elahi said.
   Nevertheless, even Ms. Bhutto's critics will acknowledge that
subtle changes have occurred in Pakistan during the past year.
   More women are seen driving cars and somewhat fewer cover their
heads. Dancing and singing are making a comeback on television.
   A couple was seen holding hands at a neighborhood shopping
center recently in Islamabad, a sight that would have attracted
police attention a year earlier. If they couldn't produce a
marriage certificate they could have been jailed.
   These newfound freedoms are not enshrined in law, however.
   Women still languish in prisons charged under Islamic laws
enacted by the late military president, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
   Before he was killed in a plane crash in August 1988, Zia
launched a program he called ``Islamization,'' inextricably linking
state and religion.
   ``Under Zia, women were officially made second-class citizens,''
said Seddique.
   Pakistan's women's affairs minister, Rehana Sarwar, said she
discovered a woman jailed with her three children because her
family opposed her marriage. Her husband was imprisoned elsewhere.
   ``The law is very harsh and unjust,'' she said. The court
presumes the woman is guilty and you must prove that you are not.
   A prominent Pakistani social worker, Ansar Burney, said more
than 50 percent of an estimated 4,000 female prisoners have been
jailed on Zina charges.
   ``Men who want to keep their women locked up while they are away
charge them with Zina,'' Burney added. ``Or a man who divorces a
woman, but doesn't want her to remarry, will lay a charge against
her. Even families who oppose a marriage may press charges.''
   However, Ms. Bhutto cannot repeal Pakistan's discriminatory laws
on her own. She needs the support of a rancorous political
opposition for a two-thirds vote in the Senate, where the
right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance dominates.
   Amnar Piracha, a lawyer and member of Ms. Bhutto's party, said
the government is committed to repealing the old laws but is
treading lightly to avoid inciting a hostile opposition.
   ``The political situation is very volatile,'' she added. ``The
opposition is daily planning to destabilize this government.''
   Women's rights activists claim Ms. Bhutto is making dangerous
concessions to Pakistan's religious right.
   The prime minister has offered to reintroduce a sweeping Islamic
law that would effectively make all of Pakistan's legislation
subject to Islamic interpretation. It caused women to riot when Zia
first introduced it but he was killed before it could be ratified.
   ``The only way to undercut the power of the mullahs is by
putting them back in the mosques,'' said Ahmed. ``Once you give
them the right to interpret legislation, you can't take it away.''

   Farhat Sadiq, once a nurse at Karachi
Civil Hospital, hugged her knees to her chest, a black scarf
framing her face, as she tearfully told a story of how three
doctors raped her and a student nurse.
   She said she cried for help but Pakistan's Islamic laws put her
behind bars.
   Farhat, 22, said she was working the night shift Aug. 6 when
three doctors called her and 18-year-old Shahnaz Sardar to a
private ward.
   She said one doctor dragged Shahnaz into a bathroom, while the
other two threw her onto a bed.
   ``Both of them raped me. I was so scared, I kept quiet,'' Farhat
said through an interpreter. ``They had a gun. They theatened to
kill me or kidnap me.''
   Farhat, claiming the doctors threatened both women into silence,
refused to go to the police until Shahnaz's sister told a hospital
matron, who reported the alleged crime. Farhat eventually agreed to
identify only one of the doctors, as Khalid Rehman, but Shahnaz
refused to name any of them.
   The result was that Farhat and Rehman both were jailed under
broad provisions forbidding sex outside of marriage, whether it's
willing or not.
   But Farhat remained behind bars for almost two months because
the same court that granted bail to Rehman denied it to her. She
appealed to the Pakistan Surpeme Court, which overturned the ruling
and released her.
   Both women still face trial on sex charges under a Pakistani law
that allows counter-charges in a criminal case.
   If both were Moslems, they would face a maximum sentence of
death by stoning under Islamic law. But Farhat belongs to
Pakistan's Christian minority and she faces 100 lashes.
   ``What will my life be after this?'' Farhat said.
   No one willingly marries a rape victim, she added.
   ``My parents won't be able to find anyone who wants to marry
me.''
   And in Pakistani society, where many women are still judged by
the number of sons they bear, remaining single is to be a social
outcast.
   Pakistan's women's rights groups have adopted Farhat's case as a
cause celebre. They say she was threatened and intimidated into
silence.
   Said feminist Najma Seddique: ``There is a widespread belief in
our society that if a woman comes out of the house, she's asking
for trouble. ... She deserves whatever she gets.''

<HEAD>Japanese Confront Own Prejudice as They Seek Ties with Third World</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry is sending emissaries
across the land to try to persuade the Japanese to be friendlier
and closer to the people of the Third World. But the task is a
complicated by ingrained prejudices in Japan toward foreigners.
   The intent of the Foreign Ministry's public relations campaign
is get the Japanese to give more heartfelt support to the aid their
government now is giving in increasing sums to developing countries.
   ``Because of our geographic isolation, it is important for
people to understand our need and obligation to contribute to the
rest of the world,'' Taro Ishibashi, director of public relations
for the Foreign Ministry, said in an interview.
   ``People think, `Why should we contribute to the developing
world who don't work hard and are very lazy.' We need to persuade
them that contributing to the Third World is good for their own
lives.''
   But Japanese attitudes toward outsiders are seen as an obstacle.
Many foreigners in Japan, for instance, face resistance if they try
to move into well-established Japanese neighborhoods.
   Two recent incidents revealed prejudices even on the official
level:
   _National Police Agency officials were obliged to apologize to
the Pakistan Embassy for an internal police document that claimed
Pakistani suspects smell, have skin diseases and tell lies. An
embassy spokesman, Mohammed Sharif, said the embassy had accepted
the apology and trusted police promises that they would change the
objectionable document.
   _Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was criticized by Justice Minister
Masao Goto on grounds that he brushed off Korean residents who
complained they had been harassed following a scandal involving
political donations by a group linked to Communist North Korea.
   Perhaps the best-known slip occurred three years ago, when
then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said the average intelligence
in the United States is lower than that of Japan ``because of a
considerable number of blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans'' in the
U.S. population.
   Japan has small minority groups, including 700,000 Koreans, many
of whom are descended from workers brought here for forced labor
during World War II, when Japan ruled Korea as a colony. Hundreds
of Indochinese refugees and Japanese ``war orphans'' raised in
China have resettled here, as have thousands of illegal migrant
workers from Asia and Latin America.
   The Philippine government has occasionally protested treatment
of its nationals in Japan, most employed in bars, nightclubs and
construction sites and often mistreated by criminal gangs.
   Most migrant labor is banned by Japanese law, and even legal
immigrants face subtle and sometimes overt discrimination in their
search for jobs, housing and acceptance as members of Japanese
society.
   Despite government calls for ``kokusaika,'' or
internationalization, many Japanese express concern about coping
with new neighbors from the Third World, people with different
languages, foods and customs.
   ``The average person will oppose even the construction of a
one-room apartment next door,'' Osamu Tateno wrote in a letter to
the Asahi Shimbun, the national newspaper. ``I can't believe the
same person will gladly lend a hand ... while their real estate
values plummet as the number of apartment houses for foreigners
mushrooms in their neighborhood.''
   ``Japan's still really a `sakoku,' or closed country,'' says
retiree Katsuji Tsuchida, referring to national seclusion during
the Tokugawa era of 1639-1854. ``Japanese people are still
prejudiced against Southeast Asians and other developing
countries.''
   ``We need to become more international,'' Tsuchida said at a one
day Foreign Ministry blitz in which officials explained Japan's
foreign policy to some 1,300 people in Gifu, a city in mountainous
central Japan.
   The Foreign Ministry has sent officials, experts and businessmen
to more than 1,000 communities since April, seeking to drive its
point home.
   Since taking office in August, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama
has ordered additional efforts, especially through television and
cartoons, to build a public consensus in favor of a generous,
internationalized Japan, officials say.
   ``People think the government is trying to steal their money and
throw it into the sea of the developing world,'' said Ishibashi,
the public relations director. ``It's a primitive but genuine
feeling.''
   ``It's important today for the government to reach the hearts of
ordinary people,'' he added.
   Japan became the world's largest donor of non-military foreign
aid in 1988, surpassing the United States, with its actual
disbursement reaching $9.13 billion, according to the Foreign
Ministry.
   More Japanese foreign aid won't necessarily change ingrained
prejudice against its recipients, but Foreign Ministry officials
say icreasingly active private aid groups are a sign that the
message of internationalization is beginning to hit home on a
personal level.
   One example is a group on the southern island of Kyushu called
the Karaimo (Sweet Potato) Exchange Foundation. It has begun to
send youths to villages in Thailand and the Philippines and to
establish partnerships between farming communities for technical
and emergency assistance.
   The government, hoping to fill gaps in its own aid program, this
year for the first time offered financial assistance to private
groups doing overseas development work.
   ``I still have some hope for the younger generation,'' said
Ishibashi. ``I hope they will understand the importance of the
pleasure of voluntarily being part of the global community.''

   Attempts to reintroduce caribou to Maine
have been thwarted by disease and bears, but based on the success
of a hearty doe named Daisy, officials will keep trying to
``transplant'' animals from Canada.
   ``We were amazed she was in as good condition as she was in''
after a 600-mile trek into and out of Canada, said wildlife
biologist Mark McCollough, leader of the privately funded Maine
Caribou Project.
   Of a dozen North American reindeer released last spring in
Baxter State Park, only Daisy is known to be alive, although a
second caribou that lost its radio collar may also be, said Richard
B. Anderson, project coordinator.
   Five caribou died after being attacked by bears, and five died
of the ``brainworm'' parasite. Others still being kept in pens have
been ravaged by brainworm and ulcers, said Anderson. More than two
dozen caribou that were used as a breeding herd remain in pens at
the University of Maine at Orono.
   Despite the troubles encountered by most of the herd, Daisy's
experience ``shows they can thrive'' in Maine, where caribou were
hunted out of the state around the turn of the century, McCollough
said. Sightings and radio tracking mark a trek from the wilderness
park in central Maine to Quebec and back.
   Daisy ``encountered everything possible,'' said Anderson. It
crossed highways, stayed healthy, undoubtedly survived meeting
bears and coyotes, ``and when we caught it, was in just as good
shape as when we let it go.''
   Two dozen caribou were shot with tranquilizer darts in
Newfoundland three years ago, rounded up on helicopters and trucked
1,200 miles to Maine. Project leaders now have asked Canada for 25
more caribou in 1990 and _ if all goes well _ for another 25 in
1991 and in 1992.
   Newfoundland's environmental and lands minister, Jim Kelland,
agreed Wednesday to give the project up to 75 caribou. ``It's
something when you can share a bountiful resource that you have
with some other area that has been deprived for one reason or
another,'' he said.
   ``This is a great Christmas present to all the people in the
United States who believe that it's important to make a commitment
to restore native wildlife species,'' said Anderson, a former Maine
conservation commissioner.
   The Maine Caribou Project wants to release about 50 caribou _
including most of those in the pens and those shipped from Canada _
next year.
   It would be the third release attempt. In 1963, two dozen
Newfoundland caribou were released in Baxter, but they disappeared,
possibly as a result of poaching, disease, predation and dispersal.
Poaching is no longer considered a major threat, thanks to stiff
new fines and jail terms for killing a caribou.
   Biologists have learned a lot from the setbacks of the latest
attempt, Anderson said. For example, they learned that shots are
more effective against brainworm than putting medication in the
caribous' food. They also learned that bears are more likely to
attack caribou than had been thought, and that bears tend to attack
their prey's face, while coyotes attack the hindquarters.
   Another lesson is that the caribou should not be kept in pens
before being released because they do not learn to defend
themselves. And it appears caribou are more prone to brainworm
while in captivity, McCollough said.
   If caribou are released again, it will probably be in higher
elevations, where they are less likely to come in contact with deer
infected by brainworm and they may fare better against predators,
he said.
   Biologists are even rethinking the way they should capture the
caribou. Some animals died as a result of a tranquilizing drug that
had varying results on different animals shot with darts during the
December 1986 roundup.
   While they are using a new drug, Newfoundland wildlife officials
are also experimenting with a roundup method used by Scandanavians
in herding reindeer _ driving caribou into a large, funnel-shaped
corral. Another possible plan is to drive them into a lake and
catch them while they are swimming.

<HEAD>Opportunities In Global Competitiveness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International competition will become an
increasingly important factor in the success of American
corporations, but some securities analysts are slow to adjust their
forecasts.
   In some instances, the business globalization in the 1990s will
be the biggest factor of all in corporate success or failure, with
brand new markets opening up simultaneously with brand new
competition.
   No previous decade ever has presented such opportunities or
perils. They include the opening of the Eastern bloc, the advent of
the European Economic Community in 1992 and further development of
the Pacific Rim nations.
   These momentous changes will exert pressure on companies
throughout the world, but they aren't the only evolving factors.
Less developed nations also are restructuring their economies and,
in fact, so is the United States.
   Stuart Robbins, research director at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette, calls it surprising, therefore, ``that most Wall Street
recommendations and analyses have, heretofore, ignored many of the
implications.''
   One possible reason for this is that the possibilities may be
too new and complex to deal with. The ultimate direction of
governments in East bloc nations, for example, is still difficult
to fathom.
   On the other hand, those nations together constitute a
population of more than 400 million people with a desire for more
consumer goods, better housing, hotels, computer services and
various components of infrastructure.
   Robbins says he feels no topic in the next few years will be of
more relevance to investments or of greater importance to U.S.
companies than global competition, and has advised his company's
analysts to assume that perspective.
   Already, according to a study by the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, about 70 percent of American industry is subject to
foreign competition. Robbins believes that is bound to increase.
   In recent years, however, a large number of American companies
have learned how to deal with such competition. Many have cut
overhead, improved quality, restructured operations and refined
market focus.
   Already, DLJ researchers have spotted what they consider to be
competitive advantages for some American industries. Among them:
   _Changing technologies could sharply realign overall metals
production, but U.S. mini-mill and specialty steelmakers should
remain world leaders in technology and cost.
   _Strong distribution, brand recognition and product quality will
provide soap and cosmetic firms with better than expected global
opportunities.
   _U.S. semiconductor concerns will gain considerable competitive
advantages against Japan in developing their positions as primary
suppliers of proprietary logic components.
   _U.S. telecommunications companies will begin to expand
worldwide by selling current capabilities in network designs and
systems and further developing their growing cellular relationships.
   _International entertainment will remain an American domain, and
U.S. companies will derive more than 50 percent of their revenue
from foreign sources.
   The opportunities _ and competition _ aren't necessarily limited
to large companies. Small business has become better organized to
understand and develop new markets in recent years and many have
learned the techniques of exporting.
   Michael Sumichrast, former chief economist of the National
Association of Home Builders and now co-publisher with Arthur
Anderson &amp; Co. of ``Real Estate Perspectives,'' a monthly
newsletter, has this to say:
   ``The Eastern bloc needs just about everything, from auto parts
to hotels, motels, roads, communication, top office space and even
mini-storage.''
   Sumichrast, who is familiar with the Eastern bloc, having been
born and brought up in Czechoslovakia, sees a need for a many
building products, ranging from nails to entire prefabricated
homes, perhaps in joint ventures.
   Yes, he says, there are problems in doing business overseas, but
then he cites the experience of the head of a small company, who
says he has sometimes found it easier to do business outside the
United States.

<HEAD>Recycling Programs Increase; Demand for Used Newspapers Drops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For two months residents of the nation's
capital have been sorting newspapers for recycling, but most of the
papers have gone no farther than a 60-foot pit near an incinerator
_ awaiting a buyer who still hasn't come.
   It's another example of the mounting newspaper glut and the
growing awareness that a successful recycling effort means more
than persuading citizens to sort their garbage.
   Stepped-up recycling across the country has made an
unprecedented amount of old newspapers available for reuse, but
markets have been slow in developing. Old newspaper inventories
have mounted and prices for recycled papers have plummeted, with
haulers often charging to take them away.
   In many cities, the local newspaper is being viewed as a villain
for not using more recycled newsprint. ``We get telephone calls and
we get scolded,'' says Dean Myhran, assistant to the business
manager at the Star Tribune in Minneapolis.
   Myhran says the Star Tribune is studying ways to use more
recycled newsprint. All but 5 percent of the paper's newsprint now
comes from virgin wood pulp.
   Nationwide about 14 percent of the 12.3 million tons of
newsprint used last year came from recycled stock, according to the
American Newspaper Publishers Association.
   Yet there is no buyer for an estimated 500,000 tons of collected
newspapers, says Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., who co-sponsored
legislation that would require pulp mills to use a certain
percentage of recycled papers.
   Prices for old newspapers have dropped from more than $30 a ton
to $5 or less if they are in good condition and well sorted.
   ``We can't buy all the newspapers that are available to us,''
says George Elder, purchasing manager at Southeast Recycling Corp.
in Marietta, Ga., which this summer doubled its recycled newsprint
production capacity to 500,000 tons a year.
   Buyers paid up to $30 a ton for recycled newspapers in New York
about a year ago, but the city now pays $15 to $30 a ton as a
``processing'' fee, says Ivan Braun, deputy director for recycling,
   In Youngstown, Ohio, where schools not long ago competed in
paper drives, newspapers now are going to the garbage dump. ``We
were getting $20 a ton, then it dropped to $10 a ton and then to $5
and when it went to zero we stopped collecting,'' says George
Finnerty, the city's litter control coordinator.
   More than 6 million pounds of newspapers have been collected
since Oct. 1 in the District of Columbia. But to date all but 250
tons remain in a 60-foot-deep pit near a municipal incinerator.
Officials say they expect to find a buyer eventually, but will
still have to pay hauling charges.
   Representatives of the recycling and newspaper industries
acknowledge the new push for recycling is likely to change
newsprint production and buying forever.
   The newspaper recycling woes also may foreshadow pitfalls in
other recycling efforts unless markets are developed for the
recycled products.
   Lawmakers in dozens of states as well as in Congress have gotten
into the act. Connecticut newspapers will be required to use
recycled newsprint for at least 20 percent of their needs by 1993
and 90 percent by 1998; a California law calls for newspapers to
meet a 25 percent goal by 1993 and 50 percent by 2000. Florida
implemented a 10 cent-per-ton waste recovery fee on virgin
newsprint and a 10 cent-per-ton tax credit for use of recycled
newsprint.
   In Congress, legislation has been introduced that would require
paper mills, including importers, to produce 10 percent _ and
eventually 30 percent _ of their newsprint from recycled material.
``For every ton of newspapers recycled, three cubic yards of
landfill space is saved,'' says Wirth.
   The move by government to mandate newsprint recycling has not
gone unnoticed among publishers. The 1,385-member American
Newspaper Publishers Association declared in a formal policy
statement last September, ``The government should not intervene in
determinations of newsprint quality.''
   ``Regulating newsprint is regulating newspapers and it is
intolerable in a free society,'' the association said.
   First Amendment questions aside, the publishers also are worried
that government-mandated newsprint content requirements will drive
up costs of newsprint and restrict competition, says Tonda Rush,
the association's director of newspaper plans and projects.
   Environmentalists say government pressure is needed to force
increased production of recycled newsprint when mills, often owned
entirely or in part by newspapers, are expanding production from
virgin pulp. The mills are adding 2.1 million tons of virgin-fiber
capacity over the next two years, according to industry officials.
   ``As long as paper mills and publishers add capacity you're
going to have a glut. I believe that's deliberate and that's why
you need to regulate,'' says Ruth Caplan, executive director of
Environmental Action, a Washington-based environmental group.
   Many major newspaper chains and publishers are rethinking their
buying practices.
   Knight-Ridder Inc. has told its mills that it plans to increase
the share of recycled newsprint at its 29 newspapers from 11
percent to 25 percent by 1992, says Homer Taylor, the company's
vice president for supply.
   Dennis Washburn, director of purchasing at Gannett Co. Inc.,
said the company's future contracts will favor suppliers that are
increasing recycling capacity. Gannett plans to increase its use of
recycled newsprint from 40,000 tons to 100,000 tons next year at
its 83 newspapers.
   Under Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, a sheet of
newsprint is considered recycled if at least 40 percent is from
recycled paper.
   According to the National Solid Wastes Management Association, a
trade group, the amount of recycled newsprint is expected to
quadruple to more than 5.5 million tons annually by 1995. That
translates to a doubling of the 14 percent of newspaper stock that
currently is recycled product.
   The trade group predicts that percentage will exceed 40 percent
by 2000.
   Newspaper executives say most of the past concerns about the
quality of recycled newsprint have been eased with new de-inking
and recycling techniques.
   ``In the state-of-the-art mills there are no problems with
quality. Older mills where they haven't spent money to update
facilities you still have color and brightness problems,'' says
Knight-Ridder's Taylor.
   Publishers point to other problems, however, in increasing use
of recycled newsprint. Among them: a shortage of de-inking plants
and the existing contracts that newspapers signed for virgin
newsprint.
   ``It's going to be two or three years before the various
industries that use old newspapers are going to be able to gear up
and make a significant dent (in the oversupply). It worries me that
communities even knowing there is a glut out there are beginning
recycling programs. They're setting the programs up for failure,''
says Ms. Rush of the publishers' association.
   In the meantime, there is concern that people will become
discouraged with recycling.
   ``There's nothing that angers any of us more than the thought
that we've gone to an extra effort at home and find out that (the
sorted newspapers) end up getting buried or burned,'' says Allen
Moore, president of the National Solid Wastes Management
Association.

<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Aykroyd sits in a Manhattan hotel room with
a cigarette all fired up. Puffs of smoke quickly fill the air, his
face temporarily obscured.
   Even without the dark glasses he wears as Elwood of the Blues
Brothers fame, Aykroyd remains mysterious. Part biker, part
bookworm, he's a private man who is gifted at imitating others _
Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Julia Child _ but without the
distinctive mannerisms that would tempt anyone to mimic Dan Aykroyd.
   That's why he's always enjoyed surrounding himself with
instantly recognizable stars such as Bill Murray in
``Ghostbusters'' and Eddie Murphy in ``Trading Places.'' An assist
is as good as a goal, Aykroyd reasons, using the appropriate sports
metaphor for a native Canadian. On or off-camera, he likes staying
behind the scenes.
   So he happily accepted the advice of a fellow biker, who urged
the actor to audition for the film ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' based on
the play by Alfred Uhry.
   Billed third behind veterans Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy,
Aykroyd's jitters about playing a dramatic role were eased by the
presence of his fellow actors and director Bruce Beresford
(``Tender Mercies,'' ``Crimes of the Heart'').
   ``When you're surrounded by such a great cast, with the
qualities they bring to a piece, you're pretty well insulated,''
said Aykroyd, 37, who portrays Boolie, the patient but
long-suffering son of Tandy's eccentric Southern Jewish matron,
Daisy Werthan.
   ``I really like to lay on a thick voice, a thick persona, a
thick accent. It's just the kind of character work I enjoy doing. I
think it's more interesting than going on screen and being one's
self, which is an awful lot of screen performance today.''
   As a screenwriter himself (``Ghostbusters,'' ``Dragnet''),
Aykroyd admired the dimensions Uhry gives to his character:
Boolie's drive for success and the material world; the desire to be
accepted by high society. As an actor, he enjoyed adding another
look to his cast of 1,000 faces.
   ``It was a period piece, so you got to wear a costume and got to
drive an old car,'' he said. ``All of that helps in enriching the
performance. I like costumes and wigs and funny glasses and hats;
whenever you put me in costume it helps me a bit.
   ``The way they (Tandy and Freeman) played the age makeup was
really spectacular. Here they are in full, full face makeup, and
yet the changes in physical motion and the voice were really subtle.
   ``I was ready to be,'' he says in a deep voice, ``Foghorn
Leghorn, the rooster.''
   Talking about comics who have tried serious roles, such as Robin
Williams and Steve Martin, Aykroyd said: ``I think the only
limitations are not in the people's talents, but in the perceptions
of the audience.
   ``If people are going to be dragged down at all, it's by the
smirkers in the audience who want them to do something wild.''
   Aykroyd, born in Ottawa in 1952, always loved to do imitations
as a child, copying the voices he heard on radio and television.
   He was active in drama at the University of Ottawa, and in 1972
joined Chicago's acclaimed Second City improvisational troupe,
meeting up with John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner and others
who three years later formed the original cast of television's
``Saturday Night Live.''
   ``We're reminded about its impact on the television form all the
time,'' said Aykroyd, who along with Belushi left the show in 1979
to pursue a film career.
   ``We've lost John and lost Gilda, so we've had much cause to
reflect and think about the past through those two losses. I follow
the new show. I watch it all the time. I like to feel I'm part of
it in a spiritual way.''
   Aykroyd, a longtime science fiction fan, cares deeply about the
spiritual world. While Murray concerned himself with ``earthly
matters'' in ``Ghostbusters,'' gleefully pursuing Sigourney Weaver,
Aykroyd and soft-spoken Harold Ramis discussed demons and slime
with the enthusiasm of kids playing Dungeons and Dragons.
   ``I love working with Harold,'' he said. ``We got to do all the
technical exposition, which a lot of actors don't like doing, but I
enjoy it. I like all that verbiage, long passages of technical
dialogue.
   ``Science fiction does change the way you look at the world.
`Ghostbusters' was essentially science fiction harnessed for
comedy's purpose.''
   ``This dimension,'' as Aykroyd calls it, lately has kept him
busy. His wife, actress Donna Dixon, recently gave birth to a
daughter, Danielle Alexandra. Professionally, Aykroyd promises
tricks old and new.
   ``I have a cable project with (Al) Franken and (Tom) Davis we'd
like to make some day,'' he said. ``We call it `Nixon in the Navy.'
It's about his old Navy days, what he's done there in the Pacific.
We'd do it in five parts on a comedy channel or something. ''

   He sits at his drawing board, a
benign, grandfatherly figure whose mild manner belies his history
as creator of some of the wildest, funniest characters in film
history.
   You may not have heard of Chuck Jones, but you're certainly
familiar with the characters he helped bring to life during the
heyday of the Warner Bros. cartoon studio: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck,
Porky Pig, Wile E. Coyote, Pepe Le Pew, Road Runner, Elmer Fudd,
and more.
   Jones, 77, lives in a spacious, ocean-view house in this Orange
County town, and he still turns out drawings in his sunlit studio.
He also has done a book, aptly titled ``Chuck Amuck'' (Farrar,
Strauss and Giroux, $24.95), which has been critically praised for
its comic brilliance.
   ``Chuck Amuck'' relates the artist's carefree California youth
as a kind of surfing Huck Finn, and his natural drift into
cartooning. For most of the book, he writes about those crazy years
at Warner Bros. when he, Tex Avery and a band of other inspired
animators created cartoons that were far more audacious and funny
than those at the Disney studio.
   Character was everything at Warner Bros., and the wilder the
character the funnier the cartoon. Jones recently talked about the
wellspring of his creations.
   ``All of the characters that I was involved with were characters
I found within myself. They were in two general categories,'' he
said. ``Most of them fell into the classic area of comedy, going
back to (Charlie) Chaplin and (Buster) Keaton and up to Woody Allen
_ when he wasn't being Ingmar Bergman _ and Richard Pryor. All of
them are losers, like the rest of us, only more so. That category
would cover figures like Daffy duck, Elmer Fudd, the Coyote, etc.
   ``Once in a while you run into another kind of character like
Bugs Bunny. He falls into a special category called `comic hero.'
It started with `It Happened One Night,' in which Clark Gable was a
comic hero and a hero at the same time. There was nobody standing
at the side and giving comic relief. Bugs falls into that category.
   ``So when you begin a picture with Bugs, because he is so strong
and can be a bully and a nuisance, you always start him in a hole
or the woods, where you would expect to find a rabbit. He would be
reading a classic tome in Sanskrit or something, a quiet-living
rabbit. Then someone comes along to do him hurt, such as take his
foot off, which is supposed to be good luck, to set him off in a
rocket or to eat him.
   ``Bugs is a natural person leading a normal life until someone
aggravates him, then he fights back. In other words, he's a sort of
counter-revolutionary.''
   Like Bugs, Daffy Duck originated in the inspired drawings of the
late Tex Avery. Jones converted both into long-lasting heroes.
   ``Tex did one of the first Daffys, `Porky's Duck Hunt,' but like
the original Bugs, the character was just nuts,'' said Jones.
``When I got acquainted with Daffy, I realized he was a person who
was very much like me. He was more courageous than I am; he rushes
in and fears to tread at the same time, which I would like to do
but don't have the guts.
   ``Daffy could be fawning and overweening and overbearing at the
same time. He can do strange things, but within all of us dwells a
Daffy Duck. Just as I later did `How the Grinch Stole Christmas'
(for television), I realized that all of us hate Christmas a little
bit. I had the opportunity to direct someone who hated Christmas
completely. That was neat.''
   Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote were born more or less by
accident, the animator recalled. He and his colleagues decided to
make a parody on chases and become the Jonathan Swifts of their
time. They needed two credible antagonists (all comedy is based on
believability), and they came up with a road runner and a coyote.
The pair so overwhelmed audiences that a series was born. So much
for parody.
   ``We arbitrarily set down rules after the first cartoon,'' Jones
recalled. ``It would always take place on the southwestern American
desert, where both characters belong. Road Runner would always stay
on the road, unless he was lured off by a detour sign.''
   Road Runner's trademark came when an artist was carrying a stack
of drawings down the hall. Unable to see ahead, he called
``beep-beep.''
   The glory days of Warner Bros. cartoons ended in 1962, because
the theatrical market for short subjects had disappeared. Since
then Jones has helped produce features (``Gay Purr-ee,'' ``The
Phantom Tollbooth''), shorts (Tom and Jerry), TV series
(``Curiosity Shop'') and specials (``The White Seal,''
``Rikki-Tikki-Tavi''). His art works have drawn big prices, and he
now serves as a consultant to Warner Bros.

<HEAD>Books: `Long Gray Line' Chronicles Odyssey of West Point Class</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS CAROLA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty graduates of the West Point Class
of 1966 died in the Vietnam War, the most of any class to see
action in Southeast Asia.
   Many are buried beneath two rows of low white stones in Section
34 of the cemetery at the U.S. Military Academy. ``Class of 1966''
is chiseled on each stone, bonding the classmates in death as it
did in life.
   Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson has written a book about
the Class of '66, tracing its arrival at the Point as fresh-faced
plebes full of Kennedy-inspired idealism to the ideal-shattering
experience of Vietnam, from postwar career changes to a 20-year
reunion of classmates sharing a ``fierce determination to honor the
dead.''
   The young men of the Class of '66 were caught between the
rapidly changing social and moral values of the 1960s and the
staunch traditions of a hallowed military academy.
   ``They are a good way of looking at our collective social
history,'' said Atkinson, whose book, ``The Long Gray Line,'' has
made best-seller lists. ``They straddle a kind of fault line of
American history.''
   The Class of '66 arrived at West Point just a month after
President Kennedy delivered a rousing commencement address to the
Class of '62. The words of Douglas MacArthur's famous ``Duty,
Honor, Country'' speech, delivered a month earlier, still echoed
through West Point's granite halls.
   ``MacArthur told them, `If you fail, the country will be
destroyed,' and they believed that,'' said the author in a
telephone interview during a West Coast promotional tour.
   Atkinson first wrote about the Class of '66 while he was a
reporter for The Kansas City Times. His four-part series, for which
he won a Pulitzer Prize in 1982, grew from a conversation with a
friend who was a '66 West Point graduate.
   ``He was talking how they had gone charging off to war and how
they were going to win the war and come home to ticker-tape
parades,'' Atkinson said. ``They thought they had a kind of social
covenant with the country: They'd go to West Point, serve their
country and in exchange they would be held in high esteem.''
   Instead, '66ers who served in Vietnam came home to derision and
distain. Many were disillusioned about the war and the Army. Some
questioned whether four years at West Point prepared them for what
they faced in Vietnam's jungles and rice paddies.
   ``When you're 22 years old, you presume yourself to be immortal.
These guys were no different,'' Atkinson said. ``Some felt West
Point and their Army training had not prepared them for combat, for
seeing other men die.''
   The deaths of two '66 graduates in particular came to symbolize
the futility and frustrations of fighting in Vietnam. The first
died when he tried to pull a soldier out of some mud and the man's
gun accidentally fired. The second was killed along with 41 other
soldiers when an American jet bombed their hilltop position in the
midst of a fierce battle.
   A hundred '66 graduates were wounded in Southeast Asia. For some
the tragedy continued after the war. Atkinson writes of two
classmates who were murdered, one by his business partner and the
other by North Korean soldiers in a border incident over the
trimming of a poplar tree.
   The author follows the odyssey of the Class of '66 mostly
through the lives of classmates John Wheeler, Tom Carhart and
George Crocker.
   Crocker became a career Army man, leading troops in Vietnam and
Grenada. In between he helped revive a drug-ridden, demoralized
Army in West Germany and served as a West Point instructor when a
cheating scandal and the admission of women sent the academy into
turmoil in 1976. He is now chief of staff of the 82nd Airborne
Division.
   Wheeler and Carhart had both resigned their commissions by 1971,
as had a third of the 579 graduates of the Class of '66.
   Carhart and Wheeler also served in Vietnam, the former in a
combat outfit and the latter in the rear echelon. The two
classmates clashed after the war when Wheeler helped establish the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, and Carhart objected to
the memorial's design, calling it ``a black gash of sorrow and
shame.''
   The 36-year-old Atkinson, the son of a retired career Army
officer, grew up on Army bases, a fact that came in handy while
writing the book.
   ``I feel comfortable around military men,'' he said. ``I know
they are fundamentally the same as anyone else. Their hair is cut a
little shorter, if anything else. I know the lingo to a certain
degree. I don't now how far it will take you, but it will help you
get a foot in the door.''
   In 1970, Atkinson received an appointment to the West Point
Class of '74, but chose to attend college in North Carolina to
study English.
   ``I just decided it wasn't for me,'' he said. ``It was the
spring of Kent State, when the war and the Army were as unpopular
as they ever were.''
   ``The Long Gray Line'' has received mostly favorable reviews
from critics and West Pointers, both past and present. At a book
signing session this fall at West Point, a long gray line of cadets
snaked through the academy bookstore, waiting to buy copies and get
them autographed by the author.
   Atkinson said he has met or talked to about half of the Class of
'66. ``I keep running into them on the road,'' he said.
   Some told the author that admitting female cadets and other
attempts at ``humanizing'' West Point have ``devalued the place in
many ways.''
   Others told Atkinson that the intense hazing cadets suffer in
their first year is ``juvenile and contrary to what constitutes the
tenets of discipline.''
   Despite whatever differences or disillusions they may harbor,
Atkinson said West Point still commands a special place in the
lives of the Class of '66.
   ``Most of them feel this great attachment toward West Point.
It's the fountainhead of their youth, as one of them said. The
academy is, was and always will be a very big part of their lives.''

<HEAD>Search for Fish Snags Ties Among Asian and Pacific Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With stocks diminishing in their own waters, Asia's
fishing nations are casting for new fishing grounds in a search
that is bringing conflicts with allies and new links with
traditional enemies.
   The issue also has reached the U.S. Congress where senators and
representatives act either for environmental reasons or to assure
plentiful supplies of tuna and salmon for American West Coast
fishermen.
   Much of the conflict, however, is in the South Pacific, where
environmentalists and governments charge that fish stocks are being
wiped out by a sudden wave of Japanese and Taiwanese fishing boats
using giant nets called driftnets.
   Japanese fishing officials say the criticism is another form of
``Japan-bashing'' motivated more by displeasure over Japan's rapid
economic growth e the United States that once welcomed Asian
fishermen to their relatively unexploited 200-mile economic zones
now have developed their own fishing industries and are limiting
foreign access to stocks that are seen increasingly as a limited
resource.
   ``It's a whole new situation that fisheries is entering,'' said
Ian Kennedy, fisheries officer at New Zealand's embassy in Tokyo.
``There's a definite trend from management not only within 200-mile
limits, but with the high value of migratory species, of fish
migrating outside the limits.''
   In 1981, Japan was allowed to catch about 1.2 million tons of
fish within the United States' 200-mile zone, but its quota was cut
to virtually zero by 1988.
   In their search for fish, some countries are entering deals with
nations they had little to do with before:
   _Companies in anti-communist South Korea have landed deals to
fish in Soviet, Chinese and Vietnamese waters.
   _Taiwanese fishing companies plan to visit the Soviet Union
early in 1990 to explore fishing cooperation, officials say.
   _China has established joint ventures with Nigeria,
Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Morocco in Africa and plans to increase
its fishing fleet in foreign waters next year from 100 to 120
boats, according to official press reports.
   _Japan is interested in entering joint ventures in Soviet waters
but is waiting for more signs of political stability in Moscow
before deciding, U.S. officials say.
   But increasingly, Asian fishing powers are turning to
international waters for their fish.
   Last season, after Japanese fishing researchers discovered large
supplies of albacore tuna in the South Pacific high seas, Japanese
driftnet boats in the region increased from 20 to 60, and Taiwanese
boats surged to at least 60 and perhaps as many as 130.
   Driftnets, which sweep as much as 30 miles of ocean at once,
consist of a line of nets, each about two miles long, separated
from each other by about a quarter of a mile, Japanese fishing
officials say. The nets, attached to floats, are allowed to drift
until they are picked up later.
   Driftnetting countries say the nets are the only economically
feasible way to fish on the high seas, where fish are less
concentrated than in coastal areas.
   In October, however, Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer of New
Zealand asked the United Nations to ban driftnetting, calling them
``walls of death'' that ``catch and kill, like a vacuum cleaner,
virtually every living creature _ including some endangered species
_ which come in contact with them.''
   In November, 20 South Pacific nations decided to ban driftnets
from their economic zones and urged Japan and Taiwan to agree to a
regional prohibition on the method.
   The two nations agreed to reduce their fleets but refused to
discuss a total ban; Japan called instead for an international
commission to oversee regional fishing stocks.
   ``There's no scientific evidence yet that driftnetting is
damaging fisheries resources, so it's premature to institute a
ban,'' said Kunio Kimura, senior managing director of the Japan
Fisheries Association.
   ``It's true that there is an incidental catch of marine animals
in driftnets,'' said Katsuyama, the Fisheries Agency official.
``But it's a mistake to ban a method because one or 10 are caught.
If the number is too large, then what we need to do is reduce it.''
   Controversy over driftnetting originally began in the North
Pacific, where U.S. salmon fishermen protested poaching by Asian
squid driftnetters.
   Taiwan has acknowledged that violations occurred and, along with
South Korea, has agreed to let U.S. officials inspect driftnet
vessels suspected of illegally catching U.S. fish.
   American officials in Tokyo say that because of the Japanese
government's tough monitoring, they do not believe Japanese
driftnetters now are poaching substantial amounts of U.S. salmon,
despite such charges by members of the U.S. Congress.
   The U.S. Senate has voted for a prohibition of imports of tuna
caught with driftnets, while a congressional subcommittee has given
its approval to a bill calling on the Bush administration to seek
an international ban on driftnetting.
   That could be embarrassing to the United States, said an
American official in Tokyo, ``because the U.S. has one of the
biggest driftnet fisheries in the world'' _ for salmon in American
waters near Alaska and elsewhere.
   ``Environmentalists have a bad taste in their mouth regarding
Japan because of its whaling,'' the U.S. official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``There's a sense that if Japan does it, it
must be bad environmentally. But if Japan does change its policy
regarding driftnetting, it could start pointing its finger at us.''

<TEXT>
   Some say 1989 has been Bangkok's Year
of the Condominium. Others call it the Year of Greed.
   The air of this once languid city of tree-shaded canals and
quiet temples now is filled with the thud of pile drivers and the
thunder of traffic.
   There seems to be no reprieve. Bangkok has become a vast work
site of mushrooming high-rises, its streets choked with traffic and
pollution at dangerously high levels.
   The boom began about three years ago. With annual growth rates
around 9 percent to 10 percent, Thailand is talked about as Asia's
next economic miracle and Bangkok as the dynamic hub of peninsular
Southeast Asia.
   Land prices in the city have soared to as high as $1,115 a
square foot in prime areas. Millions are being made in land
speculation and construction. Rents, not long ago among the most
reasonable in the world, are approaching the levels of New York,
Hong Kong and London.
   In the upper class residential area along Sukhumvit Road, more
than 50 towering condominiums, apartment blocks and office
buildings are rising on what were once leafy family compounds and
peaceful lanes.
   What worries planners and many citizens is that Bangkok is not
only destroying its past, but possibly also its future, with
unplanned growth.
   Forecasts are largely ominous.
   The United Nations predicts Bangkok's population will nearly
double to 12 million by 2000, making it the 10th largest city in
the world.
   The Thailand Development and Research Institute says the city's
mighty Menam Chao Phraya, ``the River of Kings,'' will be devoid of
all aquatic life by the end of the century unless decisive action
is taken immediately. Every day, the institute says, tons of
untreated waste pour into the river from sewers and the
now-befouled canals that earned Bangkok the name ``Venice of the
East.''
   Already serious, pollution is expected to worsen as more
factories sprout around the capital. The main culprit now in air
pollution is the omnipresent motor vehicle and its leaded fuel.
   The National Environment Board recently found lead levels along
Bangkok streets to be up to four times higher than standards in the
United States, and hospitals are reporting children with abnormally
high lead levels in their systems.
   The topic of inordinate greed by the few has become the talk of
the town. A ``me-first'' attitude is often held responsible for
many of Bangkok's woes.
   ``I believe if they could dig up Thailand and put it in a
parcel, they would sell the country, too,'' Bangkok Post columnist
Normita Tongtham wrote recently of what he described as
unscrupulous businessmen.
   Academics, journalists and some technocrats criticize what they
say is blatant pollution by commerical enterprises, disregard for
public well-being by real estate developers, and the quick resort
to bribery to circumvent regulations and laws.
   The critics claim vast economic power _ and behind-the-scenes
decision-making _ is still in the hands of a few Chinese-Thai
families and say it is their ethos that now pervades Bangkok rather
than the traditional Thai one of being satisfied with a modest
lifestyle.
   Standing in stark contrast is Chamlong Srimuang, widely expected
to win re-election in January as Bangkok's mayor.
   A 55-year-old Buddhist, he seems to represent older, rural
values that still attract a large, albeit still largely powerless,
segment of Bangkok's population.
   ``We must not be selfish,'' is one of Chamlong's tenets; another
is, ``Eat less and spend less.''
   He means what he says.
   Chamlong sleeps on a floor mat, eats one meal a day and dresses
in the rough-spun cotton shirts of upcountry farmers. He drives a
battered old car and has donated his salary to the city.

<HEAD>With Cold War Thaw, Public Likely To Demand a `Peace Dividend'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The search for the elusive peace dividend is
under way, and in an election year, with the Cold War thawing, the
government is going to have to deliver one in 1990. After watching
the Berlin Wall come apart, the voters are likely to insist on
defense cuts more drastic than the administration deems wise.
   Even though Pentagon planners say real savings are not likely to
flow from events in the Soviet Union and its freed satellites until
later, the peace dividend is too politically appealing to be
postponed.
   ``When the tide's here, we're not going to be able to shovel it
back out to sea, either,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. He
forecasts major cuts but worries that some may be premature.
   A Republican senator suggests the Pentagon should recall the
words of Alexander Ladru-Rollin, a leader in the French revolution
of 1848: ``There go the people. I must follow them, for I am their
leader.''
   Reduced defense spending next year will have more to do with the
demands of deficit reduction and with plans that already were in
place than with the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe and the arms
cuts now under negotiation with the Soviet Union.
   The budget benefits that flow from those changes will come
later, in 1991 and beyond, Pentagon planners say. But patient,
cautious business as usual won't satisfy the political demands of
the year ahead.
   ``We can talk in neat terms of threat strategy, translated into
dollars in the budget, but outside the halls of Congress are some
very active constituents in growing large numbers,'' said Sen. John
W. Warner, R-Va. ``And unless we have a real tight ... partnership
with the president, predicated on sound, real-time information, we
might see that constituency get way out ahead of both the leaders
in the executive branch and the legislative branch.''
   Warner made that observation at a Senate Armed Services
Committee hearing last week. Senate Democratic leaders have asked
that panel and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to consider
the changes in the Communist bloc and weigh their impact on
spending.
   The new year will bring dozens of congressional inquiries in
both House and Senate as lawmakers look at potential savings and
debate what to do with the money.
   That debate may produce more sound than substance. At the end of
every war, hot or cold, there's a wave of optimistic speculation
about what will be done with the resources that no longer have to
be spent on the military. The results don't match the expectations,
sometimes because of postwar recessions, sometimes because the
money has to go to old, unmet needs or to new ones that stem from
the conflict just ended.
   Former President Ford says any money freed by the easing of the
Cold War should go directly into deficit reduction, not into new
federal spending.
   President Bush has said that would be his plan. But he also has
said it is premature to be talking about a peace dividend.
   Ford said there wasn't any after the Vietnam War. He said it was
absorbed by federal spending. It also was absorbed by a soaring
inflation rate.
   ``We really never saw any beneficial result with the cutback ..
. after Vietnam,'' he said at an American Enterprise Institute
forum. ``It scares me that we'll make the same serious error when
it comes to whatever dividend you get.''
   President Bush is expected to propose a $292 billion Pentagon
budget for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, less than the
last administration budget sought, but more than Congress actually
approved for the current budget year. Not much dividend there.
   The administration warns that changes in the East and arms cuts
promised by Moscow are incomplete and reversible. ``If we attempt
to pocket too quickly the benefits that we anticipate, then we risk
undercutting the very strategy that has brought us to the brink of
success,'' Paul G. Wolfowitz, undersecretary of defense, told the
Senate hearing.
   Wolfowitz said he'd plead guilty to caution, and that the
Pentagon can foresee more substantial cuts in four or five years.
   With department stores selling chunks of the Berlin Wall as $10
Christmas gifts, caution and patience are going to be hard to
maintain.
   ``Unless we're able to predicate our budget upon sound
intelligence, sound planning, then we're not going to be able to
hold a line,'' said Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine. ``Constituents
will demand that we make massive or substantial reductions well
beyond what might be militarily prudent.''

   Six months ago, Chinese students around
the world rallied by the thousands and hastily formed aid
committees after the bloody government attack on demonstrating
classmates in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   Today, foreign interest in their cause has waned, donations have
fallen off and internal bickering over personalities and policy has
hurt their credibility.
   The exiled students watch wistfully as movements of the people
sweep Eastern Europe's Communist parties from power _ and China's
continuing crackdown from newspaper front pages.
   Nonetheless, a core of activists, led by students who survived
the June 3-4 army attack and fled overseas, are putting college and
careers on hold and exposing themselves and their families to
political retribution to organize a long-term fight for democracy
from exile.
   ``It is our duty to speak before the whole world: Chinese people
are suffering,'' said Li Lu, 23, one of only two students who
escaped in June while on the Chinese government's most-wanted list
of 21 students. He now studies economics at Columbia University in
New York City but says his career will be fighting for human rights
in China.
   ``I feel deeply guilty,'' said Li, pressing his hand to his
heart. His wife, whom he married amid the bright student banners in
Tiananmen Square, remains in China.
   In world history, exile groups have a poor record of achieving
change at home. Prospects are especially bleak for the exiles from
China, where many of the 1.1 billion people are semi-literate
peasants with little awareness of events abroad.
   ``What we do here is limited,'' acknowledged An Wei, who came
from Beijing to study and now works part-time at the China
Information Center in the Boston suburb of Newton. The center was
set up in May to get news about Chinese political developments into
and out of China, including randomly faxing Western news reports to
Chinese offices.
   ``Any change (in China) will have to happen from within. But
external pressure can have an impact,'' he said. ``If we send in
100 faxes and only 10 get into the hands of concerned people, that
will help.''
   Results may be slow in coming, said 21-year-old Wu'er Kaixi, the
other key student leader to escape. He is now studying at Harvard.
   ``We must wait for a good opportunity. It could be Deng
Xiaoping's death or another student movement or changes in the
military,'' he said. ``When it comes, we have to be ready ... to
return in a minute to China and play a role.''
   Wu'er is one of the leaders of the Front for a Democratic China,
founded in Paris in September and the most prominent of the
overseas Chinese activist groups.
   In an underheated apartment in an aging frame house in
Somerville, just outside Boston, Wu'er and fellow Chinese students
run the Front's main U.S. office. They write speeches for his
frequent public appearances, lobby for foreign sanctions against
China and plot to spirit other dissidents out.
   From dozens of makeshift offices and homes across the United
States and abroad, other exile groups also churn out news releases
and manifestos demanding democracy and smuggle anti-government
materials into China.
   A week ago, their goal of persuading foreign governments to
pressure China on human rights was dealt a blow by the trip to
Beijing of National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and a White House aide, the
first high-level American officials to visit since the killings in
June. The Bush administration said the visit was meant to mend
strained ties between the two governments.
   But even before Scowcroft's visit, many activists said they were
disappointed by the official American stance. The U.S. Consulate in
Hong Kong refused visas to many fleeing Chinese dissidents.
President Bush has vetoed bills that tried to widen sanctions
against China and allow students to remain in the United States
indefinitely.
   Bush ordered administrative protection for Chinese students, but
activists remain dissatisfied, noting he is free to cancel the
order at any time.
   Next to their visa status, financing is the main worry of the
Chinese groups, which share a scruffy, penny-pinched look.
   The China Information Center is one of the better housed, in a
two-story frame house provided by an ecumenical religious group. It
pays rent when it can.
   The Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars,
based in Washington, was formed by Chinese student groups on a
number of campuses around the country. In Chicago, six Chinese
students tape daily half-hour programs of news and commentary that
are broadcast into China on shifting frequencies as ``The Voice of
June 4.''
   The movement's only newspaper to date is the Press Freedom
Herald in Los Angeles. Yan Zhongmei, a Chinese visiting scholar in
Tokyo, has started a magazine, Democratic China.
   Spiritual grandfather to all the groups is the Chinese Alliance
for Democracy, formed seven years ago by a Chinese student
defector. From a small apartment in the New York City borough of
Queens, the Alliance publishes the anti-Communist magazine China
Spring.
   The Alliance offers a sobering example to newcomers: although it
has found steady if sparse financial support and survived bitter
internal splits, it can claim to have influenced only small groups
of urban Chinese, despite efforts by underground members in China.
   The newcomers realize that to do merely as well, they must
become better organized and work together, overcoming the
historical tendency of Chinese groups abroad toward factionalism.
Already, fellow exiles have criticized Wu'er in public for alleged
immaturity, and divisions have developed over whether the Communist
Party can be reformed from within.
   They also must figure out how to introduce democracy in a
country with no tradition of popular participation in government.
   ``The sad thing is everybody wants democracy and freedom, but if
you ask them what kind of democracy, they can't answer,'' An said.
   Yang Lixin, president of the Chinese Student Association of
Columbia University, said new groups such as the Front have yet to
democratize themselves. ``Very frequently, it is because (the
exiles) learned about democracy from books,'' he said. ``They don't
know how it works.''
   They are trying to learn, in part through lobbying activities.
   But many fear Americans will forget them, as they believe the
U.S. government is doing.
   In June, the China Solidarity Committee set up in Washington by
Feng Shengping had seven full-time volunteers answering telephone
calls. ``Now one person can handle everything,'' he said.
   Some say they have received vague warnings from Chinese
officials of eventual retribution, or their families in China have
been questioned.
   Feng predicts some activists will lose interest or be forced to
find paying jobs.
   ``But some will stay, definitely, just like after a big tide is
over, you still have rocks left behind,'' he said.
   ``People like me have burned our bridges. If we want to go back
to China to see our parents and friends, we have to promote the
cause, or else we must stay here forever.''

   Of all America's wonders, nothing has
impressed Wu'er Kaixi like the yellow school bus.
   ``It's great,'' said the 21-year-old student, one of the
spring's protest leaders in Tiananmen Square. ``When it puts on its
lights, every other vehicle must stop. It shows that in America,
the most important thing is the person.
   ``In China, no one respects people.''
   Wu'er, who was put on China's most-wanted list after the army
shot its way into Beijing in June and ended the pro-democracy
protests, is trying to continue the fight from half a world away.
It hasn't been easy.
   At 1:30 a.m. one bitterly cold December night, he sat slumped in
a chair in his shabby suburban Boston office, painfully practicing
a speech in English.
   ``We must remember our brothers and sisters who died during the
fight for democracy in Tiananmen Square,'' he read, coached by a
Chinese student with better command of English.
   His more difficult struggle, however, is mastering the
subtleties of leadership, something that seemed simple enough amid
the marching masses in the square.
   There, crowds rallied to the personal magnetism of Wu'er, a
Uygur minority student at the Beijing Teachers' University.
Classmates hailed him on campus as ``lingxiu'' _ leader _ and
foreign journalists flocked to his tiny, ill-lit dormitory room,
jammed with the bunks of eight students.
   Impulsive, dramatic, boastful and impassioned, Wu'er was the
student most often the focus of foreign television cameras in the
seven weeks of marches and hunger strikes. He seemed to recognize
no authority: At a meeting of student leaders with Premier Li Peng,
he even accused the premier of being rude.
   The cameras followed him in exile _ to Paris, where he fled via
Hong Kong during the long summer of arrests in China, and to
Somerville. Here he heads the American office of the Front for a
Democratic China, the main group formed by Chinese dissidents to
continue their movement.
   American reporters grant him celebrity status, but some fellow
Chinese resent the attention and accuse Wu'er of un-Chinese vanity.
   Many young Chinese abroad look to him for leadership. Older
exiles, traditionally paternalistic, lecture him in public for
immaturity.
   The Chinese-language press in the United States, financed from
Taiwan and mindful of financial scandal in past exile groups, has
tried to find evidence of money mishandling by Wu'er and his aides.
   The strain shows. In the Front's office, Wu'er looked harried as
he fielded telephone requests for speeches. Three equally young
volunteers dashed back and forth, asking him about the draft agenda
for a Front conference.
   ``It's harder than in Beijing,'' he said. ``In Beijing, they
tell you everything _ what you can do and can't do. Here, for
everything you have more than 100 choices.''
   Wu'er is taking courses in English and Chinese literature as a
non-degree student at Harvard. ``It's too hard to me sometimes,''
he said in English learned almost entirely since June, and still
far short of his needs. ``I understand about 30 to 50 percent of my
classes.''
   Wu'er's health has suffered. He has collapsed several times in
public, most recently after a Harvard rally marking six months
since the June crackdown.
   His closest aide, Pierre Fournier, a French student who met
Wu'er in Paris, said doctors found nothing seriously ailing Wu'er
but did note a rapid heartbeat.
   ``It's nothing,'' said Wu'er. Peering into a mirror at his pale
face and dark-shadowed eyes, he grimaced and then grinned. ``I've
lost weight, I'm happy.''
   An article in the Chinese-language World Journal last month
first broached the possibility of improper use of donations to the
student movement. The paper said Wu'er, who receives no formal
salary, accepted some donations for personal use instead of giving
everything to the Front. It accused him of staying at expensive
hotels and furnishing the Somerville office lavishly. Other reports
said he should donate speech fees, reportedly as high as $10,000,
to the Front.
   ``Wu'er doesn't really pay attention to details. He should have
been more careful,'' said Harvard student activist Luo Zhexi. He
and other students said Wu'er was innocent of legal or moral blame
and was merely inexperienced. He is now accounting for all money,
they said.
   His office looked far from luxurious. The donated second-hand
desks were deeply scratched, and volunteers wore thick sweaters in
the poorly heated rooms.
   Wu'er has tried to ease the tension by retreating a bit.
   ``I don't want to be a media star,'' he said. ``That's not what
we wanted in Tiananmen.''

   In addition to its annual poll on the year's top
news stories, The AP this year surveyed news professionals on the
top stories of the decade of the 1980s. Here is a report on the
results.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the thawing of the Cold War were voted
the story of the 1980s by editors and news directors of member
newspapers and broadcast stations of The Associated Press.
   Other stories in the decade's top 10 were, in descending order:
the AIDS epidemic, Ronald Reagan's tax-cutting presidency, the U.S.
drug plague, explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, the Iran
hostage crisis and other terrorist acts, the nuclear meltdown at
Chernobyl, China's suppression of its democracy movement, the
Iran-Contra affair, and continuing strife in Central America.
   The 306 U.S. editors responding to the poll gave 2,593 points to
Gorbachev and his relaxation of the Soviet Union's iron grip in
Eastern Europe. The AIDS story received 1,830 points for second
place, and the Reagan presidency 1,138 for third. A first-place
vote earned a story 10 points and a 10th-place listing one point.
   The stories by ranking:
   1. Gorbachev assumed leadership in the Soviet Union in 1985 with
a policy of reform of a faltering communist system. In a series of
stunning developments in 1989, he withdrew Soviet troops from
Afghanistan and then stood aside as mass popular movements undercut
Communist power in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany. Gorbachev even gave tacit approval in November as the
incarnation of the Cold War, the Berlin Wall, crumbled amid joyous
celebrations by East and West Germans.
   2. AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ first made its
deadly appearnce in the United States in male homosexual
communities. It spread relentlessly among heterosexuals and drug
addicts through sexual contact and shared hypodermic needles. In an
age of ``miracle'' drugs, science could not find an antidote to the
plague of AIDS' lingering death.
   3. Republican Reagan was elected in 1980 vowing to trim the
federal government. He cut taxes sharply and shrank social programs
in a fundamental reversal of government trends. Huge defense
outlays during his two terms, however, created enormous deficits
and more than doubled the national debt. The former film star
brought Hollywood techniques to campaigning and the White House,
sent troops to the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada, named the
first woman to the Supreme Court, softened his view of the Soviet
``evil empire,'' survived an assassin's bullet and left office as
popular as when he entered it.
   4. Drug addiction and the crime that comes with it rotted the
core of America's inner cities and spread across the landscape.
Efforts to halt the flow of cocaine from the Andean valleys of
South America were only marginally successful, and some responsible
people debated the legalization of drugs.
   5. In the 1980s, the United States launched reusable manned
spacecraft _ the shuttle. But the explosion of the shuttle
Challenger, just after launch from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 28, 1986,
shut down the U.S. manned space program for two years. All seven
aboard Challenger, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, were
killed. A faulty seal on the rocket shell and unusually cold
weather were blamed.
   6. Terrorism zeroed in on American targets through the 1980s,
most agonizingly in Iran, where 52 Americans _ and with them the
presidency of Jimmy Carter _ were held hostage for 444 days by
followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   7. An explosion and fire in a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in
the Soviet Ukraine in 1986 killed at least 31 people, forced the
evacuation of thousands, and spewed radioactive clouds that circled
the globe. It was a severe setback to nuclear energy.
   8. Communist China liberalized its economic system through the
1980s. In 1989, freedom began to blossom with the spring in
Beijing, only to be brutally suppressed when Chinese troops killed
hundreds, if not thousands, of protesting students around Tiananmen
Square.
   9. Lt. Col. Oliver North became a national figure overnight in
1986 when it was learned the United States had sold arms to Iran
and used some of the proceeds to supply pro-American guerrillas in
Nicaragua. Dramatic congressional hearings and prosecutions
attempted to learn who, including President Reagan and Vice
President George Bush, knew what and when.
   10. Washington, haunted by memories of Vietnam, walked a
tightrope all decade long through civil wars in El Salvador and
Nicaragua. Efforts to support democratic government in El Salvador
were embarrassed by right-wing death squads within the military. In
leftist Nicaragua, U.S. assistance for the Contra guerrillas wound
down as President Bush succeeded Reagan, who had called the Contras
the moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers.
   Among other stories receiving votes were the continuing
political and legal showdown over abortion, the Armenian earthquake
of 1988, the rise of democratic movements in the Third World, such
as Corazon Aquino's in the Philippines, the 1987 free fall of the
stock market, the continuing U.S. trade deficit, and scandals in
the TV ministries of Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.
   Further down the list: concern for the world environment, the
homeless on American streets, the deaths of 270 people in the
explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, the deaths
of more than 3,000 in the Union Carbide gas leak at Bhopal, India,
the earthquakes in Mexico City and San Francisco, the eruption of
the Mount St. Helens volcano, Hurricane Hugo, continuing troubles
in the Mideast, Pope John Paul II wounded in an assassination
attempt, takeover fever in the U.S. business world, change in South
Africa, the assassination of India's Indira Gandhi.
   In a separate AP poll of news editors in 44 other countries,
based on a different ballot, Gorbachev's rise and the changes in
Eastern Europe were voted the Nos. 1 and 2 stories of the 1980s,
followed by: AIDS, China, Chernobyl, environmental problems,
Poland, Afghanistan, U.S.-Soviet relations, and Mideast peace
efforts.
   Those results were based on 121 ballots from newspaper, radio,
television and news agency editors on six continents.

   Doctors aren't the only ones issuing
prescriptions for cancer patients at Presbyterian Hospital. The
patients themselves can order up a dose of Dangerfield, or a Marx
Brothers booster, from the Laugh Mobile.
   ``It's a real pick-me-up,'' said Wanda Mooers, who's been
battling cancer of the lymph nodes for more than 14 months. ``You
can pick out things _ even Play-Doh and crayons _ to take your mind
off your problems.''
   Every Monday and Friday, volunteers wheel the 5-foot-tall,
yellow cart around Presbyterian's seventh-floor cancer unit. It
holds about 35 videotapes, ranging from ``National Lampoon's Animal
House'' to ``The Three Stooges'' to TV sitcoms and comedians like
Rodney Dangerfield, as well as humorous books and audio tape and
games _ even Slinky toys.
   ``I look forward to it,'' said Mooers, the mother of two young
sons. ``When you're going through chemotherapy and radiation, you
need to put yourself in a good state of mind, which is sometimes
difficult to do.''
   ``It gives them some diversion while they're in the hospital,''
said Sherry Bargoil, cancer control program coordinator.
``Medically speaking, we know there is some mind-body connection.''
   In his book, ``Anatomy of An Illness,'' Norman Cousins wrote:
``Even if we find that laughter produces no specific biochemical
changes, it does accomplish one very essential purpose, it tends to
help a person cope with apprehension and even panic that all too
frequently accompany serious illness.''
   Hospital officials got the idea after talking with patients, Ms.
Bargoil said. ``Some of our younger leukemia patients who were
staying with us for long periods began bringing in their own VCRs
and renting tapes. We began to think, `Why can't we do something
like this?'''
   They consulted Ruth Hamilton, executive director of the Carolina
Health and Humor Association, who started the first Laugh Mobile at
Duke University three years ago, and the hospital auxiliary
provided $5,000 to pay for it.
   In January, a second Laugh Mobile will begin making the rounds
at the children's cancer unit at Prebyerian, and officials are
toying with the idea of working out a deal with a national video
chain to offer new movies.
   Mooers said the program means a lot to her, especially when
she's feeling lonely and depressed. ``I honestly feel more people
should pay attention to the people in the cancer ward. They should
stop by and see how they're doing.''

   Merrell Scott was afraid to leave her house.
   ``When you have a panic attack, you feel like you're going to
die. Your hands and feet get tingly, you feel nauseated, the room
spins, you have hot and cold flashes. It's awful,'' said Mrs.
Scott, 35, who suffers from agoraphobia, the fear of open spaces.
``For me, outside pressures or just anything can start it and once
it starts, it just starts rolling and takes off.''
   But she and other anxiety-prone worriers are finding help.
   ``Worrying isn't necessarily bad, but ruminating over and over
about what awful thing can happen is useless,'' said psychologist
Rowland Folensbee. ``It distracts you and you become too
preoccupied with `what ifs.'
   ``It's usually `What if?' rather than `What can I do about it?'
''
   Folensbee, operator of The Worry Clinic, specializes in treating
anxiety disorders; he is one of only about 10 such specialists in
the country.
   ``For some, worry is a way of being on guard: `If I'm always
thinking of things that happen, I'm always vigilant,''' he said.
   ``For others, it's an avoidance technique: `I've spent a lot of
time worrying about it, so I don't have to go and tell my boss I
need a raise. I've done my part, I've worried about it.' For some
people, worrying about it gives them a sense of control: `If I
worry about it, it won't happen; if I fail to worry about it, it
will happen.'''
   Folensbee recommends that people learn to identify when they
begin to worry, and then to refocus their attention. One technique
is to set aside a time to worry each day, allowing nothing else
during that time and allowing no worrying at any other time of the
day. ``We approach worry as being a process rather than whatever
the worry is about,'' he said.
   It's not that worriers don't have legitimate problems, it's that
they become obsessed _ and often depressed and stymied, he said.
``It appears to me that people who are worriers have some things to
worry about, but no more than the average person. We all have the
concern about how our kids are going to do in school, but we don't
spend the greater parts of the day worrying about it.''
   Folensbee met with Mrs. Scott and then had her join a support
group of 10 to 30 clients who suffer anxieties and meet weekly at
Charter Hospital.
   ``We've become like a family to each other,'' she said. ``It's
like my husband says: he can sympathize with me but he can't
empathize. With the group, you know there are other people around
who have this, and you are not alone.''
   ``Some of the people in there seemed to be worse off than me,''
joked Charles Higginbottom, 36, a telephone lineman who joined
after he had become so stressed he no longer could function at work.
   Many of those who suffer crippling anxieties are ``people
pleasers'' who do anything and everything for someone else,
overextending themselves and leaving themselves short in personal
time, Folensbee said. In the group, clients with different fears of
anxieties share common feelings and physical complaints.
   ``They suffer with something similar to me,'' Higginbottom said.
``Some people have a fear of flying or a fear of driving. I didn't
have a particular fear, but the things we talk about are problems
for me, too.''
   Higginbottom, who was so worried about being called on yet
another string of emergency repair jobs that he had to leave his
job for two months, said that thanks to the group, ``I just went
from dark to daylight.''
   Mrs. Scott, too, has found strength from Folensbee and the group.
   ``It was hard, and I found out I had to go by myself to get out
there. Before I would either rely on my husband or friends or
neighbors. But I started out small _ going to the grocery store for
five minutes _ and building up.
   ``I had to face the fear, be in crowds, sit and have to live
through the panic attack. I can remember he sent me to a Macy's
one-day sale and he made me stand in line for 20 minutes and I
cried the whole time.
   ``Last week, I went to Macy's one-day sale and I stayed four
hours and didn't even think about it.''

<HEAD>Disappointments Mar Search for Genes Triggering Psychiatric Disorders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to find defective genes that help
trigger psychiatric disorders have produced only disappointments
this year, but gene-hunting researchers say they remain optimistic.
   A highly publicized 1987 paper, for example, reported evidence
that a gene for manic-depressive disorder in three generations of a
large Amish family lay within a portion of the chromosome numbered
11. But this year, most of the co-authors joined other scientists
to report that new data greatly weakened the evidence for the
gene's existence.
   ``The evidence has not completely disappeared,'' said co-author
Ken Kidd of Yale University. But now ``it's not a strong bit of
evidence.''
   Scientists seeking possibly defective genes within the 23 pairs
of chromosomes everyone carries study large families with seemingly
inherited tendencies toward diseases. This lets them look for
genetic differences showing up in the sick people when compared
with family members without the disease.
   Other studies involving manic-depressive disorder, which has
nearly 2 million Americans alternating between depression and
excessive euphoria, have suggested that a gene resides on the
chromosome designated X.
   Miron Baron of the Columbia University College of Physicians and
Surgeons considers evidence he and others presented in a 1987 paper
to be strong, though not compelling. Hugh Gurling of the University
of London, citing other research with similar findings, considers
the link to the X chromosome confirmed.
   But Kidd said the 1987 study, which follows a ``somewhat
checkered history'' of similar research, has met with skepticism
among his colleagues. ``A lot of people just don't know how to
interpret it. It is not broadly accepted in the scientific
community as a definitive study.''
   And Elliot Gershon of the National Institute of Mental Health
said a study not yet published has found no evidence of a
manic-depression gene in the location Baron's paper proposed.
   ``We don't know what the story is on chromosome X and
manic-depressive illness,'' said Gershon, chief of the clinical
neurogenetics branch of the institute's intramural research program.
   Scientists want to find and analyze the genes because it might
lead to advances in diagnosis and treatment. When they fail to
confirm a reported genetic link, it can mean one of three things:
the first report was incorrect, the one that failed to confirm the
link overlooked the gene, or both were right _ the gene exists in
family members studied for the first paper, but not in people
studied for the second.
   Such uncertainty surrounds Gurling's 1988 study that found
evidence of a gene for schizophrenia on chromosome 5. It included
seven families from Iceland and Britain. No evidence for such a
gene appeared in another study, published at the same time, of a
large Swedish family.
   This year, separate studies on families from Scotland and North
America also found no evidence of the proposed gene.
   Gurling, who plans confirmatory studies of his own in Icelandic
families within the next couple months, considers some attempts to
test his results poorly designed. Beyond that, he believes the gene
is not a predominant cause of schizophrenia outside Iceland. So if
it is related to only a fraction of cases elsewhere, many people
will be needed to detect its presence.
   ``We simply have not tested enough families so far,'' and it may
take another 20 to 100 families to give Gurling's findings a fair
chance of being confirmed, said researcher William Byerly of the
University of Utah Medical Center in Salt Lake City. ``The Gurling
data looks to me still promising, but it's likely to be a rare
cause of the disease.''
   Kidd said he doubts Gurling's proposed gene exists. But he and
other researchers are hopeful about future chances for finding
genes for psychiatric disorders. ``There's a very healthy
realization that this is not going to be easy,'' said Kidd. ``I
don't think it's impossible.''
   ``I'm optimistic,'' said Baron. ``But I think we have to be
prepared for hard work and perseverence, and a high frustration
tolerance.''

<HEAD>Chemist Makes Clean-burning Fuel With Cooking Oil, Methanol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mixture of common cooking oil and
methanol will be tested as a fuel in a Regional District bus.
   ``Diesels run very well on it,'' said Thomas Reed, a Colorado
School of Mines chemist. ``Thirty percent added to diesel fuel will
reduce (tailpipe) smoke. Or we can use it as a substitute. We'll
try it Transportation
both ways.''
   Reed uses a process called transesterification to combine
cooking oil and methanol to produce a fuel that is 10 percent
oxygen. It is cleaner than diesel fuel and produces 95 percent of
the energy, and he has even been able to make the product using
waste drippings from such things as french-fry machines.
   ``I went down to the local fast-food restaurant and bought a
gallon of waste oil,'' he said. ``We added the methanol and cooked
it. All the nastyivision. ``We have shown
that exposure to UV light causes a marked depletion and change in
the skin's antioxidant defense mechanism, and now we are seeking to
learn how to prevent compromise of this important protective
system.''
   Work by Packer and colleagues at LBL and the University of
California, Berkeley, has been reported in recent issues of the
Journal of Investigative Dermatology, and in Photochemistry and
Photobiology.
   They tested the skin sensitivity of hairless mice to A and B
ultraviolet light, the most plentiful and damaging UV components of
sunlight. Both caused significant loss in the skin of antioxidants,
which prevent initial DNA damage and also may guard against later
stages of tumor development, Packer said.
   ``The idea is that topically applied antioxidants may confer
protection by being destroyed first _ before DNA and other
important molecules,'' he said.
   But products of UV damage can slip into deeper layers of the
skin and unexposed tissues, particularly after chronic UV exposure;
the damage products can enter the blood, affecting other parts of
the body later, he added.
   The researchers want to conduct more studies on whether
``antioxidant therapy'' through diet could be more effective than
treatment with a cream of some type, Packer said. ``Each of the
stages in the development of skin cancer may be affected by UV
exposure and may involve production of destructive oxygen species
that can be counteracted by antioxidants.
   ``Our work should therefore suggest valuable and new approaches
both to prevention of skin cancer and to protection against an
adverse outcome once cancerous changes have begun.''

<HEAD>Americans Probably Will Eat Better in the Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the last few years, Americans have tried all
sorts of new foods, many of them in an effort to improve our
health. As a new decade arrives, some cooks think Americans' eating
habits will only get better.
   ``I've never been more optimistic about the progress American
food has made in the last decade,'' said Ellen Brown, a cookbook
author and food consultant.
   ``I think there will be a geometric growth in the '90s _ in the
quality and the excitement of what we're eating. And I'm not just
talking about the upper echelon of restaurants and homes but a
general awakening of the American palate,'' she said in a recent
interview.
   Julee Rosso, former owner with Sheila Lukens of the Silver
Palate gourmet shop, said the wide range of ingredients now
available in this country have led to a shift away from French
foods and toward Italian peasant cooking.
   And experts who warn that nutrition and health are strongly
linked are finally getting through, Rosso said.
   ``Because of all the really frightening news about what eating
habits can do to our health, certainly that's influenced all of
us,'' she said, adding that knowledge influenced ``The New
Basics,'' Rosso's and Lukens' new book, which they intended as a
book for the 1990s.
   Rosso noted that it includes almost 200 vegetable recipes and
more fish recipes than in their first two books. ``I think that's
just a big commentary. I think of my protein more as a side dish. I
really emphasize my vegetables, starches and grains.''
   ``One of the premises of this book is that you can cook again in
your own home ... instead of that stop-start cooking only on the
weekends,'' she said.
   The availability of fresh fish and ingredients for ethnic dishes
in most places in the country is remarkable, Brown said. ``This
really is a national concern about quality and I see it as going
noplace but forward. Once the palate has progressed it never will
regress.''
   Cooking Light magazine has issued a list of items it expects to
be popular in the coming decade, reflecting a shift in eating
habits: garlic, grains, sorbets, salsas, fresh fruit pies,
potatoes, turkey, iced coffee drinks, breakfast, bagels and lean
red meat.
   Brown noted that even fast-food restaurants are changing, adding
salads to their menus and changing recipes for old items.
   Of course, people still will seek treats.
   ``Moments of indulgence need to be spaced,'' Rosso said. ``And I
think people are learning that if you have something that's very
good and very tasty, you tend to eat less of it because you are
more esasily satisfied.''
   ``When I'm in a restaurant, I'm going to splurge, but when I'm
at home, I want my food to be as healthy and flavorful as
possible,'' Brown said.

<HEAD>Humor No Laughing Matter; Researchers Report It's Healthy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, `Mrs. Carlson,' to make 2nd reference to Knight,

   Ina Carlson still laughs at life despite two heart attacks and
quadruple bypass surgery. ``Why not,'' she says, with a chuckle.
``That's what keeps me going. Wouldn't it be awful if I sat back
and cried.''
   No wonder she's the poster patient and spokespatient for one of
a growing number of hospitals putting humor into health care amid
new evidence suggesting that laughter may benefit the ill as well
as the healthy.
   ``Laughter indeed may be like a good medicine,'' says Dr. Lee
Berk, of the School of Medicine at Loma Linda University in
California.
   ``Those patients that had the will to live had a sense of humor
and were able to use their humor in fighting their illness,'' says
Kathy Knight, a nurse at University Hospital in Albuquerque, N.M.,
who founded ``Humor And Hospitals Are Healthy Allies,'' _
``HAHAHA'' _ the program Mrs. Carlson represents.
   ``I forget about myself when I can laugh with somebody or at
somebody,'' says Mrs. Carlson, an 80-year-old widow, adding that a
good joke ``makes me feel better. I forget that I'm just living on
pills.''
   Mrs. Carlson, who has been in and out of University Hospital in
Albuquerque, N.M., was having a serious picture taken with three
doctors for a medical school recruitment brochure when Ms. Knight
decided to have some fun. She put Minnie Mouse ears on Mrs. Carlson
and Goofy, moose and chicken hats on the doctors. ``Today, cheer
someone up,'' her poster says.
   ``You can't help but look at that picture and laugh,'' says Ms.
Knight.
   Programs like University Hospital's are spreading, bringing
humor to patients on their walls and on wheels _ special carts
loaded with everything from balloons to bubbles, from comic books
to comedy videos.
   ``Research findings are beginning to accumulate that suggest ...
laughter might be therapeutic and could be used to reduce disease
symptoms,'' says Lars Ljungdahl, of the Lyckorna Primary Health
Care Center in Motala, Sweden.
   Preliminary findings in a study of six women suffering painful
muscle and bone disorders suggested that humor therapy can increase
quality of life and relieve some chronic symptoms, says Ljungdahl,
whose findings were reported in a January letter to the Journal of
the American Medical Association. He noted that clinical evaluation
still is lacking and further studies are needed.
   A new study of 10 people who watched a humor video for two hours
and had blood samples taken every 10 minutes found decreases in the
hormones cortisol and epinephrine, or adrenalin, which are released
during stress, Berk says. The overall effect was a healthy drop in
blood pressure, heart rate and stress.
   Those hormones also can weaken the immune system and counter the
``good'' hormone endorphin, a painkiller and mood elevator, Berk
says. By reducing the flow of cortisol and adrenalin, laughter
counters the weakening of the immune system and allows endorphins
to work on pain unopposed.
   Joseph K. Neumann, a psychologist with the Veterans
Administrataion in Johnson City, Tenn., says more controlled
studies are needed. ``A lot of people who have published in this
area have reported on case studies or studies with groups of people
who haven't had an experimental control group.''
   While agreeing that humor is therapeutic, Neumann says it may
not be more effective than anything else that would induce a
pleasant experience, such as relaxing music. He studied two groups
of patients who underwent surgery under a local anesthetic while
awake. One group listened to a tape of an old Jack Benny radio show
and the other group listened to relaxing ocean sounds. ``Basically
there weren't any consistent or significant differences.''
   Humor is serious business to people like Joyce Anisman-Saltman,
assistant professor of special education at Southern Connecticut
State University in New Haven, and Joel Goodman, head of The HUMOR
Project in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
   Their message on why it's healthy to laugh and how to bring more
humor into work and life is taken so seriously that they're in big
demand by organizations ranging from IBM to the Massachusetts Turf
Growers Association.
   Major corporations are putting humor in training programs,
believing it sparks creativity. ``When the world is closing in,
you've got to do something to change your mood so you can function
creatively by looking at a favorite cartoon, remembering some silly
line, trying to find something silly going on in daily life,'' says
Monsanato Co. researcher Robert Z. Greenley in St. Louis.
   Mrs. Anisman-Saltman, who gives five to 10 lectures a week
across the country, tells audiences to avoid ``energy suckers,
people who grab you in the hall and only have terrible things to
tell you about that drag you down. Surround yourself with positive
people.''
   Problems can be handled when they're in perspective, she says.
``A sense of humor helps you take a step back from the problem that
looks really terrible up close. When you have a little distance
from it, it looks less terrible.''
   ``I think people are really coming to their senses of humor,''
says Goodman, who has a network of 100 people across the country
working with The HUMOR Project. ``People are realizing humor is not
just kid stuff. People are realizing humor can do many good things
for us.''
   Mrs. Anisman-Saltman, a funny teacher and briefly a stand-up
comic, got on the lecture circuit six years ago when the local
library in her hometown of Cheshire, Conn., was running a series on
healing and invited her to speak.
   But stark reality nudged Goodman into a life of humor. In 1977,
his father was stricken with a life-threatening aneurism and facing
surgery in Houston. A funny thing happened to him on his way to the
hospital to visit his father: The driver of the hotel van, a man
named Alvin, made him laugh, easing the stress.
   ``A couple of months later when Dad was successfully recovering,
I got to thinking what a wonderful gift Alvin had given us. I began
to wonder, `Do we have to wait for the Alvins of the world to cross
our paths just when we need them by luck or should we be more
intentional about this thing called humor.'
   ``I began to think it was too good to leave to chance so in 1977
I started The HUMOR Project, which was not designed to analyze
humor to death but to answer my own curiousity about whether there
ware practical ways of bringing humor to life.''
   In the last dozen years, more than a quarter-million people have
attended HUMOR Project programs, Goodman says. In the past three
years, the project also has given grants to 36 hospitals and groups
to help develop their own programs.
   Goodman, the author of eight books, tells audiences to look for
humor in reality and in very serious places like newspapers and
church bulletins. ``That is where humor is most absent at first
glance and where it's most needed.''
   He has found a gem or two. A newspaper reported: ``Vandals made
off with all the toilet seats at the police station. Police have
nothing to go on.'' A church bulletin advised parishioners: ``There
will be meetings in the north and south ends of the church.
Children will be baptized on both ends.''

businesses and cheap asset sales in a bid to avoid bankruptcy.
   The struggling financial services firm said Wednesday the loss

<HEAD>Paper Makers Ask: Send Us Better Scrap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paper companies intend to use more recycled
material but they say they need the help of the collecting public
to make sure they get a high-quality supply.
   State and municipal efforts to increase paper recycling are
sometimes coming up short, when they can't get rid of the waste
paper they collect because the scrap doesn't meet standards,
officials of the American Paper Institute said Wednesday.
   Group officials urged businesses and governments to make sure
they had a purchaser lined up before beginning an extensive
collection program and to separate grades of paper so the scrap is
usable.
   ``Quality recycled paper will always find a market,'' Red
Cavaney, president of the New York-based institute, said in an
interview.
   The appeal came as the institute issued its 32nd annual capacity
survey.
   Confirmed expansion plans should add 8.63 million tons of annual
production capacity in paper and paperboard through 1992, the
institute said.
   That increase should maintain the U.S. industry's share of world
capacity at the 30 percent it now holds, according to the survey.
   The paper industry continues to make strong profits because of
the nation's continued economic expansion, overseas demand and the
increase in international trade, which brings about increased need
for packaging.
   Annual profits of the 27 public paper companies that the
institute tracks are running about even with last year's record $8
billion and amount to about 7 percent of sales, a historic high,
paper institute officials said.
   Demand for paper products closely follows the economy, and
institute officials said paper companies were braced for the
possibility of an economic slowdown in 1990.
   The institute also said waste paper is growing in importance,
both for export and domestic use. In 1992, waste paper is expected
to account for 27.2 percent of the materials for paper and
paperboard production, up from 25.4 percent this year.
   The problem of inferior scrap paper is not so bad with
newsprint, where recent advances in technology have made it easier
to produce high-quality newspapers with 100 percent recycled
fibers, officials said.
   The biggest limit on producing new newspapers from old ones is
the delay in building de-inking facilities and mills that can take
advantage of the technological advances, said James Hutchison, vice
president of the paper group.
   Some newsprint collected in new mandatory recycling programs has
had to be buried because it was unusable, but Cavaney said ``most
of the good stuff can find a home.''
   Besides new newspapers, scrap can be made into tissue or boxes,
exported, shredded for animal bedding or mulched for laying grass
seed along the sides of highways.
   A bigger problem is in recycling printing and writing paper
because the quality of the recycled product has to be high and the
amount of contamination is great.
   Contaminants include windows in envelopes, the sticky material
on the back of postable notes and paper that is printed with laser
printers, Cavaney said. He said the ink from laser printers cannot
be removed with current technology, so it spoils whole batches of
recycled paper.
   ``One of the great challenges to the industry is to help people
understand the challenges of recycling,'' Cavaney said.
   In its forecast, the institute predicted:
   _Total paper and paperboard capacity by 1992 will be 91.1
million tons a year.
   _Use of waste paper will rise to 25 million tons in 1992 if the
industry operates at capacity that year. Consumption this year is
estimated at 20.9 million tons.
   _Wood pulp capacity should rise at an annual rate of 2.8 percent
in the three-year period of 1990-92.
   _Capacity to produce paper and paperboard will rise at a
slightly faster 3.4 percent annual rate.
   _Paper production capacity should grow 3.3 percent a year during
the three-year period, while newsprint capacity growth should
average 5.1 percent annually and printing and writing paper
capacity should grow 3.6 percent annually.

<HEAD>$1 Billion Quarterly Loss for Troubled Investment Firm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Integrated Resources Inc. said it lost $1
billion in the second quarter as it struggled to sell off assets,
retain its insurance brokerage sales force and avoid a bankruptcy
court filing.
   The financial services firm said Wednesday the loss exceeded a
previously anticipated $600 million decline mainly because of
substantially lower-than-expected proceeds from the sale of its
core businesses.
   ``Obviously what happened to them in a major way is just
shocking,'' said Tom Fendrich, a managing director for Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. ``Everybody knew that Integrated was a deteriorating
situation, but nobody expected it to be an exploding one.''
   Integrated's battered stock closed unchanged at 37{ cents
Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange trading. Before announcing the
default, Integrated traded at around $15 a share.
   Integrated on Wednesday reported a loss of $1.04 billion, or
$141.15 a share, on revenue of $70.59 million in the April-June
quarter. That compared with earnings of $12.78 million, or 68 cents
a share, in the same period a year earlier.
   The once high-flying real estate concern stumbled trying to
expand into financial services. Integrated attributed the delay in
reporting its second-quarter results to drastic changes since it
defaulted on nearly $1 billion in debt in June.
   Integrated is seeking to restructure its debt and raise capital
to meet payments on a total of $1.75 billion in debt to and avoid
seeking bankruptcy court protection from its creditors.
   The bulk of the second-quarter losses was pinned on write-downs
in the value of businesses and assets Integrated has sold,
discontinued or plans to sell because of its financial troubles.
   A major contributor to the loss was the much-reduced sale price
for its central financial services businesses.
   Integrated in November reached agreement to sell the businesses
to Broad Inc., a Los Angeles financial services concern, for a
maximum of $225 million. It had hoped to receive $450 million.
   That deal, which is pending, where two of the subsidiaries are
based, is subject to price adjustments at the time of closing that
are expected to lower its value.
   ``These losses reflect the serious impact of our liquidity
problems,'' Integrated said in a statement. ``We are attempting to
address these problems by working with our creditors to restructure
the debt.''
   For the first six months of 1989, Integrated reported a loss of
$1.04 billion, or $141.93 a share, on revenue of $180.8 million,
compared with profits of $19.86 million, or 59 cents a share, on
$213.8 million in revenue a year earlier.
   The write-downs affect the financial services subsidiaries being
sold to Broad: Integrated Life Insurance Co. of Des Moines, Iowa;
Capitol Life Insurance Co. of Denver; Integrated Resources Asset
Management Corp., an investment adviser; Integrated Resources
Equity Corp., its main broker-dealer subsidiary; and Resources
Trust Co.
   A Broad spokeswoman said the deal has been approved by Iowa's
insurance commissioner but regulatory approval was pending in
California and Colorado.
   Integrated said $110 million of the loss resulted from
restructuring expenses.
   The firm also cited poor industry conditions for the sale of
limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts, an absence
of revenue because of the termination or restructuring of some
investment programs and higher interest payments because of
increased borrowing.

<HEAD>Airbus Chief Proposes Global Consortium for `Son of Concorde'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a major aircraft builder has
proposed that companies from the United States, Europe and Japan
join together to produce the next supersonic jets.
   Jean Pierson, chief executive officer of Europe's Airbus
Industrie, raised the idea for the first time Wednesday in a speech
to an airline industry group. Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, is
a consortium of four aircraft companies _ from France, Britain,
West Germany and Spain _ that competes with Boeing Co. and
McDonnell Douglas Corp. of the United States.
   Boeing, the largest commercial aircraft maker, was caught by
surprise by Pierson's remarks.
   ``Boeing and other companies have been studying the viability of
high-speed transport but it's too early to tell what kind of
airplane may emerge from those studies or how it might be
produced,'' said Richard Schleh, a Boeing spokesman in Seattle.
``Certainly, international cooperation is one option that merits
continued study.''
   Officials of McDonnell Douglas weren't immediately available for
comment.
   ``That there will be a son of Concorde is beyond doubt,''
Pierson said, referring to the supersonic passenger jets jointly
built by France and Britain. ``When and how is another question.''
   Because of the enormous investment required by such a project
and the relatively small market for the aircraft, the jets should
be produced in one worldwide program, Pierson told the Wings Club.
   ``The most brilliant engineers, the super-minds from the USA,
Europe and Japan working together as a team to produce a world
plane, a plane that will shrink our planet further, is not a
utopian dream,'' he said.
   He proposed an international consortium, based in the United
States, that would bring together U.S., European and Far Eastern
companies to produce and market new high-speed jets.
   However, he warned, such a consortium only would succeed as a
true partnership of equals, as in Airbus.
   ``If instead, one of the participants were to seek supremacy
over others or were to attempt to divide the others to rule, then
there is no doubt that Europe, through Airbus Industrie, would have
no recourse but to go its own way.
   ``There would inevitably, then, be two supersonic transport
programs competing fiercely for a limited market.''
   In response to a question, Pierson said he hasn't yet discussed
the SST consortium idea with potential partners. However, he added,
``I intend to be active on the subject.''
   Airbus, which has had increasing success in selling jets to big
airlines around the world, now holds an estimated 30 percent of the
market for commercial aircraft.
   The partners in Airbus are Aerospatiale of France, British
Aerospace PLC, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm Gmbh of West Germany and
Casa of Spain.

<HEAD>Time Warner Merger Creates Windfall for Banks, Officers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   AP Business Writer=
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The $14 billion merger of Time Inc. and Warner
Communications Inc. generated a multi-million dollar windfall for
the investment banks that financed it, as well as corporate
officers.
   The banks will split more than $120 million in investment
advisory fees and expenses while some of Warner Communications' top
executives will each garner nearly $20 million from the settlement
of three stock plans.
   Bert W. Wasserman, chief financial officer for Warner, will make
more than $21 million in cash under a prior agreement for
liquidating stock options and stock appreciation rights. Warner's
general counsel, Martin D. Payson, will collect a similar amount.
   Even the Securities and Exchange Commission stands to make an
estimated $4 million from the filing fees that accompany such a
large transaction. Those fees will go to the U.S. Treasury.
   The fee disclosures came in a recent prospectus, filed with the
SEC, for two new classes of convertible, preferred stock that Time
Warner Inc. wants to issue in January. Time and Warner earlier this
year agreed to the $14 billion combination, which would create the
world's largest media and entertainment concern, Time-Warner Inc.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. were
each paid ``$16 million for acting as financial advisors'' to Time
Warner. Shearson Lehman, made an additional $32.5 million in fees
for a $1 billion ``bridge'' loan that was repaid Oct. 11.
   A bridge loan is a short-term advance, which yields high fees to
the lender, made in anticipation of longer-term financing.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. also received $32.5 million in fees for a
similar $1 billion bridge loan and collected an additional $1.5
million in financial advisor fees.
   Lazard Freres &amp; Co. collected $20 million for serving as
Warner's financial adviser and chief investment banker.
   Time Warner also paid out $350 million in fees to commercial
banks that provided additional financing.
   In all, the communications giant will have to pay an estimated
$500 million in fees and expenses.
   And sizeable chunks of cash will be going to corporate officers.
   In addition to Wasserman's $21.1 million; Payson, the general
counsel is expected to get about $19.5 million and Deane F.
Johnson, an executive in the office of the president of Warner
stands to make $20.1 million.

<HEAD>Alliance Airport Opens, Concept Takes Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   When an American Airlines jumbo jet touches down today at
spanking new Fort Worth Alliance Airport, it will signal a major
step in a unique project conceived by the son of billionaire H.
Ross Perot.
   The project is touted as the nation's first industrial airport
and an example of how to rebuild America.
   ``The whole point of what we have done and achieved is that
working with the government, you can build a lot of infrastructure
programs rather quickly,'' said H. Ross Perot Jr.
   ``This is a great example of teamwork,'' he said. Indeed the
name comes from the ``alliance'' of Perot and local, state and
federal agencies.
   ``A lot of experts say the 90s will be the decade of rebuilding
America, and this is one way, these public-private partnerships,''
he said.
   The VIP-filled plane will land ``18 months, 19 days, 23 hours
and 25 minutes'' after the airport's groundbreaking, something of a
record in cutting through a federal bureaucracy: airport
certification averages three to five years.
   Federal employees were even at work Thanksgiving Day installing
equipment, said Jack Sasser, deputy regional administrator for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   Much work still needs to be done, including building a permanent
tower to replace temporary facilities in a trailer, although
American Airlines already has begun construction on its $400
million maintenance base _ the plum Perot landed last summer that
gave the $250 million project credibility.
   The federal Drug Enforcement Administration plans to base a
fleet of 90 planes at the airport. Sante Fe Railway has completed a
car distribution facility for Honda and is beginning work on a
similar facility for Ford.
   Although the project is ahead of schedule, ``before the whole
thing is really, no kidding ready, it'll probably be two years,''
Perot said.
   The airport, on land donated by Perot and owned by the city of
Fort Worth, was first proposed by the FAA as a relief valve for
busy Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport 15 miles away.
   The FAA approached The Perot Group with the idea in 1987 because
Perot had spent millions of his father's dollars amassing 17,000
acres to become the largest landowner in rural Tarrant and Denton
counties.
   The money came from the $2.7 billion Perot received when he sold
Electronic Data Systems Inc. to General Motors Corp. and then was
bought out of his additional stock and kicked off the board in a
bitter dispute with GM Chairman Roger Smith.
   Instead of creating an adjunct to DFW, Perot Jr. thought bigger,
dreaming up Alliance Centre. Although the FAA at first was
reluctant to increase the scale, it eventually went along,
especially after then-House Speaker Jim Wright of Fort Worth pushed
through a bill telling the agency the airport was a high priority.
   The airport, which will be managed by a Perot company, consists
of a 9,600-foot runway and two taxiways that can handle planes up
to the mammoth C-5A cargo jet and 747s. It is the largest U.S.
airport constructed since DFW opened 15 years ago.
   ``Alliance will be an airport surrounded by business and
industry,'' Perot says. ``It will allow aircraft to carry raw
materials directly to manufacturing facilities around the airport.
These materials can be quickly integrated with on-site
manufacturing processes before loading onto aircraft for transport
around the world.''
   In addition, Alliance lies on a major north-south rail line and
Perot has gotten state agreement to improve roads around the
development to better connect with nearby interstate highways.
   Perot even donated $500,000 to a local school district to allay
its fears over lost tax revenue because of concessions granted
American to lure its maintenance base.
   Perot admits success of the concept can't be measured for 20 to
25 years, but ``if it works, it will be profitable.''
   In the meantime, Perot is focusing on bringing traditional
aviation-related clients to Alliance, selling them Perot-owned land
by the runway or on the same 3,800-acre plot as the airport.
   Employees can live in a Perot-owned development nearby _ 150
houses already have been built _ and shop at a planned shopping
mall _ a development company recently purchased land to build the
complex.
   One estimate put possible revenue from land sales at $1 billion.
Estimates on the cost of the property range from $100 million to
$500 million.
   FAA officials are now suggesting similar concepts to help
relieve other congested airports, although they admit the scale
will be hard to duplicate because there are few areas with access
to a Perot-like war chest and willingness to wait for a payoff.

<TEXT>
   Advertising and marketing services giant WPP
Group PLC, which has taken a place among the world's largest ad
holding companies through record-setting acquisitions over the past
few years, is through with major purchases for the next few years,
Chief Executive Martin Sorrell said.
   But Sorrell, who has guided WPP's transformation into one of the
world's largest ad conglomerates, told securities analysts
Wednesday that the Japanese and others may be interested in
pursuing major advertising deals.
   London-based WPP, whose sole business was once making wire
shopping baskets, has the distinction of making the two biggest
acquisitions in advertising history plus numerous smaller buyouts
in the past three years.
   In 1987, it acquired the parent of the J. Walter Thompson
advertising company and the Hill &amp; Knowlton public relations firm
for what was then an industry record $566 million.
   WPP shattered the ad buyout record last sumer with an $864
million purchase of Ogilvy Group, parent of the ad agency Ogilvy &amp;
Mather Worldwide.
   The acquisitions lifted WPP's billings to about $13.5 billion,
placing it in a contest with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC for the
rankings of the world's biggest advertising holding companies.
   Sorrell told analysts at the 17th annual PaineWebber media
outlook conference that new business billings have risen by another
$1.2 billion in the past year. That includes new assignments of $40
million from Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. for J. Walter Thompson and
$40 million from Olivetti for Ogilvy &amp; Mather.
   Asked if he had any plans for additional large acquisitions,
Sorrell replied it was ``unlikely we will do anything of
significant size for two or three years.''
   WPP has indicated in the past that it may be interested in
making smaller acquisitions in areas such as health care, database
management and market research.
   The company also recently indicated it is considering buying a
minority stake in a television franchise in the United Kingdom as a
way of generating a profit and gaining experience in another area
of the media business.
   Sorrell told the analysts he is intent on improving profit
margins at J. Walter Thompson, where the company already is well
ahead of the goals WPP set for it when it was acquired, and at
Ogilvy.
   In addition, Sorrell said he hoped to improve margins at Hill &amp;
Knowlton and MRB Group, the market research unit.
   He said that while WPP will be sitting the mega-deal market out
for the next few years, there still may be large-scale buyout
activity.
   Sorrell noted Japanese agencies may find it necessary to expand
overseas along with their big clients who find it ``more difficult
to achieve their objectives in the Japanese market.''

<HEAD>Police Warn Banks, Hospitals About Computer Virus Disc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scotland Yard has warned banks, hospitals,
universities and other institutions to be on guard against mailed
computer disks which sabotage computers.
   Scotland Yard said in a statement Wednesday that electronic
codes on the floppy disks labeled ``AIDS Information Introductory
Diskette'' have destroyed information in at least 10 computers.
   But the London newspaper The Independent today reported that
rumors in the computer world put the figure much higher.
   Scotland Yard's Fraud Squad has launched an investigation after
receiving reports of the disks from around Britain.
   Among those reported to have received the disks are the London
Stock Exchange, British Telecommunications PLC, which runs most of
the nation's telephone network, the Midland Bank, Lloyds Bank, the
Australia and New Zealand Bank in London, universities, hospitals
and public health laboratories.
   The London newspaper The Guardian reported today that the disks
contain ``a Trojan Horse computer virus'' which attacks
International Business Machines Personal Computers. IBM is one of
the world's biggest makers of computers.
   The paper said the Stock Exchange alone has around 2,000
Personal Computers, of which 700 are linked into a network.
   The Independent said computer systems in hospitals are among
those damaged. It said the disks had also turned up in California,
Belgium and Zimbabwe but gave no details where.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association quoted an
unnamed Health Education Authority spokesman as saying a contact in
Norway also received one.
   Police say a letter with the disks asks for a ``license fee'' of
either $189 or $378, depending on the type of license, to be sent
to an address in Panama.
   But they say many of the disks were mailed in London's South
Kensington district.
   The letter warns that if the money is not paid, the sender will
use program mechanisms to stop a computer functioning normally.
   Computer companies said they believed addresses for receiving
the disks were obtained from PC Business World, a British weekly
trade paper on computing.
   Joe Hirst, former technical editor of Virus Bulletin and a
consultant on computer software, told The Associated Press
Wednesday: ``There are two programs on the disk. The first is an
installation program and the second is a questionnaire on the risk
of AIDS which will not run unless it is installed on a hard disk.
It then prints off an invoice for a company in Panama but the
damage has already been done by the installation.''
   The alarm was first raised Tuesday by Dr. Alan Solomon, chairman
of the IBM Personal Computer User Group, who said he received one
of the disks on Monday.
   At the Stock Exchange, an official, speaking anonymously, said:
``You must be off your head if you get an unsolicited disk and put
it in your machine.''
   Police said PC Business World sold its 700-name mailing list in
good faith to someone claiming he wanted to publicize the export of
computers to Nigeria.
   The Independent said the list was bought for a reported 800
pounds, or $1,280, by a Kenyan businessman, E. Ketema.
   ``The paper reported: ``Mr. Ketema had taken out a short-term
subscription with The Business Center in New Bond Street, London,
to receive mail and telephone messages on his behalf while he was
in the country from Oct. 31 to Nov. 30. He described himself as an
accountant, but the center does not know his first name, nor does
it have a forwarding address.''
   The paper said some computers where the disk is used could crash
immediately while in others the damage is delayed.
   The Guardian said the letter with the disks says the money
demanded should be sent to ``PC Cyborg Corporation'' at a box
number in Panama. But the paper quoted police as saying neither the
corporation nor the box number _ 87-17-44 _ exists.
   The paper said an American computer software company, Cyborg
Systems, and its British subsidiary sent warnings to customers
Wednesday that it was not involved.
   The Guardian said IBM's British office has sent one of the disks
to its computer virus research group in the United States.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in early European trading
today. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said the market was nervous in thin
year-end volume which they said was about 70 percent of normal,
causing exaggerated fluctuations.
   Market participants were also squaring positions ahead of
Friday's scheduled release of U.S. trade figures for October, they
said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.37 yen to a closing 144.07 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 144.08 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
quotes, included: 1.7330 West German marks, down from 1.7390;
1.5591 Swiss francs, down from 1.5965; 5.9360 French francs, down
from 5.9475; 1.9503 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9430; 1,294.00
Italian lire, down from 1,296.25; and 1.1605 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1585.
   In London, the dollar fell slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.5994 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5955 late
Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $408.90 a troy ounce,
down from $411.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $409.45.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $408.70, down from $411.00 bid late
Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $6.08 to close at a bid $408.65.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.57 a troy ounce
compared with Wednesday's $5.59.

<HEAD>Stocks Once Againt Up In Tokyo, Dollar Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index, whose climb
has been almost without pause in the last three weeks, closed at
another record high today while the dollar edged up against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 118.28
points, or 0.31 percent, closing at 38,180.70. It closed above
38,000 for the first time on Wednesday, when it climbed 258.89
points to 38,062.42.
   Investors cut into the Nikkei's gains this afternoon, however,
selling shares out of concern over the speed of recent rises,
dealers said.
   It took only 16 trading days for the index to gain more than
2,000 points. It first climbed above 36,000 on Nov. 21.
   ``Market players were gradually becoming cautious and reluctant
to buy further, and the number of issues purchased has declined,''
said Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co.
   Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co.,
attributed the index's gains to investors' expectations that
reforms in Eastern Europe will bring Japan bigger business
opportunities.
   ``Recent market movements have little to do with economic
fundamentals, but optimism over economic liberalization in Eastern
Europe,'' he said.
   An estimated 800 million shares, unchanged from the previous
day, changed hands on the first section. Among gainers were steel,
petroleum and railway issues.
   The dollar closed at 144.07 yen, up 0.37 yen from Wednesday's
143.70-yen close. It opened at 144.13 yen and ranged between 144.05
yen and 144.23 yen.
   Overnight gains on overseas markets led to the higher opening,
but the dollar moved narrowly after that as the market awaited the
announcement of several U.S. economic indicators, including October
trade figures, due Friday, traders said.
   Mitsui Bank trader Yoshitsugu Hanada said the West German mark,
which soared against other major currencies on Wednesday, slumped
today as market players sold it for profit-taking and position
adjustments.
   ``The mark weakened against the yen also as investors who had
been selling the yen to buy the mark bought back the yen,'' he said.
   The dollar-yen dealings remained inactive with only small
position adjustments, Hanada said.
   Spot trading amounted to $3.46 billion, down sharply from
Wednesday's $8.42 billion.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for first period of December 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and nine
selling days last year, and 289 selling days so far this year
compared with 291 selling days in the corresponding period a year
ago.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table. Subaru and Isuzu began producing cars and light trucks
in September at a joint venture plant in Lafayette, Ind.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

   Domestic automakers may be testing market
strength as they hold off boosting incentive packages although
their sales continue to fall, analysts say.
   The eight major U.S. automakers reported Wednesday their dealers
sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 22,589 during the
Dec. 1-10 period this year, down 23.7 percent from a rate of 29,610
a day during the same time last year.
   Car sales were off 27.9 percent and truck sales were down 16.6
percent.
   ``A year ago, we had some pretty aggressive incentives,'' said
analyst Doug Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New York. ``No one
is going to confirm this, but I believe the industry is trying to
gauge the actual level of demand without incentives to see what
they can do without throwing out money needlessly.''
   Cash rebates and lower-than-bank-loan interest rates have become
part of car buying. But automakers pay for the incentives out of
their profits, which were severely dented in 1989.
   Chrysler Corp.'s early-December car sales fell by 33.1 percent,
Ford Motor Co.'s dropped 30.2 percent and General Motors Corp.'s
car sales during the period were off 28.4 percent.
   ``These are pretty close to what we've been getting in the last
two (selling) periods,'' Laughlin said.
   With just 2{ weeks of selling left in 1989, the industry
appeared to be heading for the seventh-best year on record, selling
somewhere around 14.8 million cars and trucks.
   Last year's sales of 15.8 million was the second-best in
history, behind the 16.3 million vehicles sold in 1986. Sales
totaled 15.5 million in 1987.
   So far this year, car and truck sales are running 3.2 percent
behind last year's pace. Car sales are down 4.3 percent and truck
sales are off 1.2 percent.
   Chrysler said its early-December truck sales were down 16.4
percent, combining with car sales for a 25.1 percent decline in
vehicle sales. Through Dec. 10 of this year, Chrysler's cars and
light trucks were selling at a pace 6.7 percent below last year.
   Ford said its 30.2 percent decline in early-December car sales
and a 16 percent drop in light truck sales combined for a vehicle
sales rate 24.4 percent lower than during the same period last year.
   So far this year, Ford's cars and trucks are selling at a rate 3
percent below last year's pace.
   GM said its combined car and truck sales in early December were
23.9 percent lower than they were during the same time last year,
as its decline in car sales combined with a 14.9 percent drop in
light truck sales.
   For the entire year, through Dec. 10, GM's vehicle sales are
down 5.8 percent.

   Prosecutors notched another victory in their
assault on Wall Street crime when a jury convicted GAF Corp. and a
top executive of stock manipulation in the government's third
attempt after two mistrials.
   The guilty verdict Wednesday in Manhattan federal court _ where
a judge one day earlier sentenced hotel queen Leona Helmsley to
four years in prison for tax evasion _ again demonstrated public
opposition to white-collar wrongdoing.
   Some lawyers were surprised by the verdict because of
controversial and sometimes contradictory testimony by admitted
felon Boyd L. Jefferies and evidence introduced at the trial's
close undermining central portions of the government's case.
   ``The pattern you see from a variety of these cases is that if
there is some smoke there _ circumstantial evidence _ then juries
tend to find there is some fire,'' Columbia University securities
law professor John C. Coffee Jr. said.
   ``I do think the jury particularly in Wall Street cases has a
good deal of skepticism of the motives of people,'' he said. ``This
is a case where there was some evidence, but it was a one-witness
case.''
   GAF and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin were found guilty on all
eight counts of stock manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud
and conspiracy. Two GAF subsidiaries were acquitted of all charges.
   Sherwin, 56, of Princeton, N.J., faces up to 40 years in prison
and $2 million in fines when sentenced March 9 by Judge Mary
Johnson Lowe. GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and building
materials manufacturer, could be fined a total of up to $4 million.
   ``Justice is finally done,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H.
Loewenson Jr. said.
   After the verdict, an ashen-faced Sherwin embraced his wife and
daughters. ``I'm terribly disappointed and I'm innocent of these
charges,'' he said to reporters.
   GAF and Sherwin's attorney, Stephen Kaufman, said they would
appeal the conviction. The subsidiaries found innocent were Jay &amp;
Company Inc. and GAF Chemicals Corp.
   A July 1988 grand jury indictment alleged a scheme to boost the
stock price of Union Carbide Corp. in 1986 shortly before GAF sold
a large block of Carbide shares amassed during a failed takeover.
   When the case first opened a year ago, it attracted wide
attention as the first criminal trial stemming from the insider
trading scandals of the mid-1980s.
   It lost some luster amid a series of glitzier cases, in which
the government won convictions in all but one case, where a jury
returned a split verdict.
   Among those convicted: six defendants in the Princeton-Newport
Partners racketeering trial, takeover specialist Paul A. Bilzerian
and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. bond trading assistant Lisa Jones.
   In addition, the government has obtained guilty pleas from
figures such as former investment banker Martin A. Siegel,
arbitrager Robert Freeman and stock speculator Salim B. Lewis.
   ``It's another part of the message that the U.S. attorney's
office has been sending to the financially fortunate of our
country, that manipulation of our financial mechanisms and failure
to pay taxes are going to be severely dealt with,'' said attorney
Gerald Walpin, a former prosecutor.
   The GAF jury returned a verdict after about only eight hours of
testimony. The second mistrial, in March, was declared after 12
days and 93 hours of deliberations. The first mistrial occurred
because the government unintentionally withheld a key document.
   ``Maybe all the media concentration on fraud on Wall Street has
pressured the public that all the fraud on Wall Street was more
severe than it thought initially,'' said Alan Bromberg, a
securities law professor at Southern Methodist University.
   ``I think we're developing a pretty healthy distrust of our
financial institutions,'' he said.
   In the trial's final days, GAF lawyer Arthur Liman introduced
telephone records indicating that no calls were placed on
long-distance WATS lines from the Jefferies &amp; Co. brokerage to GAF
or Sherwin during times in October 1986 when the government alleged
the manipulation was discussed.
   ``It seemed to be a pretty significant piece of evidence but the
jury didn't think so,'' said one defense lawyer in a major case who
asked not to be named.
   Jefferies testified that Sherwin asked him to boost Union
Carbide's price to $22 a share and agreed to pay 40,000 to cover
losses in the deal.

<HEAD>Year-End Bonus Becoming Ghost of Christmas Past</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Workers used to getting year-end bonuses are
increasingly hearing that unless they've earned it, the traditional
lump sum will be replaced by the proverbial lump of coal.
   Compensation experts say performance-based incentives are
replacing Christmas bonuses, which _ while technically
discretionary _ are frequently perceived by employees and employers
alike as gifts.
   ``The Christmas bonus is disappearing,'' said compensation
consultant Paul Muller, ``because it no longer is in concert with
business needs and practices.''
   Bosses who substitute incentive programs for traditional holiday
bonuses may risk being labled Scrooges.
   But the trend actually reflects the Santa Claus principle of
rewarding good _ meaning productive _ behavior, said Muller,
director of Midwest compensation consulting for Ernst &amp; Young, a
New York-based consulting firm.
   ``In effect, management now is saying, `To the extent that you
help us be successful, we'll help you be successful,''' Muller said
Wednesday.
   He had no statistics to support his contention that year-end
bonuses are disappearing but other experts agreed that a trend
toward incentive-based compensation was apparent.
   Bob Kurisu of Strategic Compensation Associates in Los Angeles
said Christmas bonuses are ``kind of an anachronism'' and are
rarely found in large corporations.
   But at companies where year-end bonuses have been traditional,
workers often expect them and management may feel obliged to hand
them out even if the company has not had a particularly good year,
said Frank Belmonte, a compensation consultant with Hewitt
Associates in Lincolnshire, Ill.
   ``When you consider eliminating it, it's not an easy thing to
do,'' he said. ``It's a very emotional issue.''
   Therefore, he said, employers planning to replace the annual
giveaway with an incentive-based program should give employees
plenty of advance notice and spell out clearly the performance
goals they will have to meet to qualify for incentive pay.
   ``Don't eliminate it and say nothing,'' Belmonte said.
``Eliminate it and do a lot of communication and explanation.''
   Compensation experts said traditional year-end bonuses in the
United States typically represent 5 percent to 6 percent of annual
pay for hourly workers and 10 percent to 15 percent for middle
managers and executives.
   The move away from holiday bonuses coincides with a trend toward
fewer employee and retiree benefits, especially in the
health-insurance area, and lower corporate profits.
   But Muller said the elimination of year-end bonuses is motivated
not by cost-cutting but by management's desire to increase worker
productivity.
   While U.S. employers are becoming less generous with bonuses,
their Japanese counterparts are growing more so. Japanese companies
ordinarily pay bonuses twice a year, in summer and before the new
year.
   Employees at 291 Japanese companies got winter bonuses this
month averaging $4,870, up 7.3 percent from last year and the
biggest increase in nine years, the Japanese Federation of
Employers Association said Wednesday.
   An association official in Tokyo attributed the increase to
business prosperity in Japan.

<HEAD>Chrysler Debt Rating Knocked Down A Notch by Moody's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ratings for some Chrysler Corp. securities were
dropped one level by Moody's Investors Service because of concerns
about the automaker's future.
   Moody's, a credit rating service, said in a news release
received Wednesday in Detroit that it was lowering the ratings
because of ``concerns that Chrysler's operating performance will
remain under pressure over the intermediate term,'' or three to
four years.
   Moody's rating for Chrysler's senior debt was lowered to
``Baa2'' from ``Baa1.'' Moody's analyst Carol Verschell said that
was toward the lower end of the company's investment-grade ratings.
   Movement in security ratings indicate increasing or decreasing
faith in the creditworthiness of a company.
   Another rating service, Fitch Investors Service Inc. said it was
reviewing Chrysler's securities and Standard &amp; Poors Corp. said no
change was likely.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston read a statement saying: ``We're
disappointed in the action that Moody's has taken. But we believe
that it will not have any material effect on Chrysler ... borrowing
costs.''
   Chrysler stock closed at $19.87{ Wednesday, unchanged from
Tuesday's close.
   Moody's also said Chrysler's share of the light truck market,
which includes the company's popular minivans and Jeep vehicles,
will come under increasing competitive pressure.
   Chrysler's announcement earlier this month to sell Chrysler
Technologies Corp., which includes Gulfstream Aerospace Inc., will
provide some cash, Verschell said, but the timing of the sale and
the amount of the proceeds were uncertain.
   At Fitch, auto analyst Mary Anne Sudol said her company's
ratings for a variety of Chrysler securities were either the same
or slightly higher than Moody's new ratings. All Chrysler ratings
are under review, she said.
   ``There will be some action, but I don't know when it will
come,'' Sudol said.
   Nancy Stroker of Standard &amp; Poors said her company affirmed the
``BBB'' rating of Chrysler securities, roughly the same level as
Moody's. ``We don't expect to have any kind of rating change,'' she
said.
   Verschell said Moody's wasn't reviewing the ratings of General
Motors Corp. or Ford Motor Co. securities.
   Moody's announcement of lower Chrysler's ratings came before the
company reported that sales of its North American-made cars and
trucks fell 25.1 percent in early December from the same time last
year.
   Through Dec. 10, Chrysler's vehicle sales were running 6.7
percent behind last year's pace.

<HEAD>UAL Board Says To Consider Buyout Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. plans to meet with an investment group,
which is threatening to seize control of the airline company's
board, to explore alternatives for ``maximizing values for all
shareholders.''
   At its Wednesday meeting, the UAL board also authorized a
controversial $32 million to lawyers and investment bankers to
cover incurred by a failed pilot-management buyout proposal of the
parent of United Airlines.
   The company already had paid pilots and management $27 million
as reimbursement for buyout expenses. The payments were questioned
last month in a hearing of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on
antitrust, monopolies and business rights.
   The UAL board is under pressure from the investor group Coniston
Partners, which owns 11.8 percent of UAL's stock, to sell or
restructure the company to boost share prices.
   Coniston has threatened to launch a shareholder drive to dump
most of UAL's directors.
   After its regularly scheduled meeting at UAL's Chicago-area
headquarters, the board issued a statement indicating the company
would consider takeover proposals from third parties as well as an
employee-management group.
   ``While no proposal has been received by the board, continuing
discussions are occurring with certain employee groups with respect
to the basis and the terms of a possible buyout proposal,'' the
statement said.
   ``The outside directors will consider acquisition proposals from
the management-employee group or any other third party when such
proposals are made.''
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf has been under pressure to come up
with a firm proposal for raising the company's stock price and
staving off disgruntled investors.
   UAL stock closed at $168.75 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange, down $8 from Tuesday.
   Analysts said the drop indicated that investors did not believe
any takeover agreement is near completion.
   ``The conclusion from observers is that there is no deal close
to being consummated to take the company private, recapitalize or
anything like that,'' said Stephen Dexter, an analyst with Kemper
Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
   UAL management, in meetings with employee groups, has circulated
a new employee buyout plan that would value the company at $240 a
share, or $5.43 billion, the Chicago Tribune reported Tuesday,
quoting unidentified sources.
   Leaders of the flight attendants and pilots unions have said
they would carefully review the proposal. But the powerful
Machinists union, which represents about 25,000 of UAL's 70,000
workers, already has criticized the plan.
   Opposition from the Machinists helped scuttle a $6.75 billion
pilot-management bid supported by British Airways PLC for United,
the nation's second-largest airline in October.

   Britain's unemployment rate fell 0.1 percent to
5.8 percent in November, its lowest level since the autumn of 1980,
the government said Thursday.
   The jobless rate, which registered 5.9 percent in October, has
been falling for 40 months.
   The seasonally adjusted rate stood at 7.5 percent in November
1988, the Department of Employment said.
   The number of jobless fell by 25,200 in November, more than the
20,000 the financial markets had been expecting.
   Without seasonal adjustment, the number of unemployed totaled
1.61 million in November, compared with 1.64 million in October and
2.07 million a year ago.

<TEXT>
   The European Community on Thursday
fined West German chemical producer Bayer AG $590,000 for violating
competition rules in the marketing of an animal feedstuff additive.
   The fine stems from Bayer's insistence that its West German
customers buy the additive, which boosts growth in animals, only
for themselves and use it only in the factory where the product was
delivered, the Commission said in a statement.
   The West German patent for the additive expired in 1985, opening
it up to competition and lower prices, the Community said.
   Bayer's requirement that its German clients buy only for
themselves was designed to keep clients from reselling the additive
to neighboring nations ``where patent protection still existed and
where prices were higher,'' the Commission said.
   Its fine is worth 500,000 European currency units.

   The stock market declined broadly today amid
renewed worries about the business outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 8.32 to 2,752.77
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 301 up, 680
down and 514 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.40 million shares as of 10

   Analysts said traders were unsettled by word late Wednesday of
deepening problems in the debt-burdened retailing empire of Campeau
Corp. in Toronto.
   Campeau officials said its Federated Department Stores and
Allied Stores operations might file for bankruptcy protection in
early 1990 if new agreements can't be reached with lenders.
   Adding to the wary mood was anticipation of a quarterly ``triple

<HEAD>New Federal Restrictions on Columbia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A two-month, $320 million drop in
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan's huge junk bond portfolio has prompted
federal authorities to restrict the thrift's high-risk deals and
halt dividend payments.
   Columbia officials said the company would not oppose the
restrictions imposed by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision.
The company disclosed the new limits in a regulatory filing made
public Wednesday.
   The restrictions on certain types of loans and so-called
``high-risk transactions'' such as funding leveraged buyouts
parallel corporate adjustments underway at Columbia to comply with
recent legislation signed by President Bush to end the nation's
thrift crisis.
   In a Nov. 20 letter to Columbia, regulators said the thrift's
capital ``is substantially inadequate'' to cover its junk bond
holdings, the company disclosed in the regulatory filing.
   At $3.8 billion, Columbia's junk bond holdings are the largest
by far among the nation's savings and loans. They account for 40
percent of the thrift's assets.
   Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk securities. Prices paid for
junk bonds have plunged in recent months amid fears of a recession
and concerns about bonds that have been issued by troubled
institutions.
   The value of Columbia's junk bond portfolio declined by $220
million in October and another $100 million in late November.
   Under the new federal capital-standards restrictions signed by
Bush in August, Columbia and other thrifts must divest junk bond
portfolios by July 1, 1994.
   On Monday, Columbia announced that Thomas Spiegel would resign
as chairman and chief executive to set up a separate entity
expected to hold and manage the junk bonds.
   Columbia also agreed to seek permission from regulators before
paying any new dividends to shareholders. The thrift last paid a
dividend on Nov. 28, at 7 cents a share.
   Columbia also needs to seek federal approval before funding any
non-real estate commercial loans and risky transactions including
leveraged buyouts, in which a company is bought and the debt paid
off through cash from the sale of assets or operations.
   The restrictions will remain in effect until regulators approve
a new plan to be submitted by Columbia on how it will meet the new
federal capital guidelines.

<HEAD>Federated and Allied Department Stores Threaten To Seek Bankruptcy
Refuge</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Eds: subs lead and 8th graf to clarify that the chains might
seek bankruptcy-court protection.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federated and Allied chains, owners of
Bloomingdale's and other big retailers, could seek bankruptcy-court
refuge early next year if lenders won't reschedule their $7 billion
debt, their parent company said.
   ``In the next 30 to 60 days, there's going to be a restructuring
one way or the other. One way is a voluntary restructuring. The
other would be under bankruptcy protection,'' an official at
Campeau Corp.'s headquarters in Toronto said Wednesday on the
condition on anonymity.
   Federated and Allied, both based in Cincinnati, said in filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the companies
expect to run out of cash by March, possibly as early as next
month, unless creditors ease repayment terms.
   Federated must pay creditors $1.15 billion by the end of April.
Allied says it faces debts of $633.7 million due by the end of
March.
   Federated and Allied took on $8 billion in debt, much of it in
high interest ``junk bonds,'' as part of their takeover by Canadian
real estate magnate Robert Campeau. Campeau bought Federated in May
1988 and Allied in December 1986.
   Olympia and York Developments Ltd. of Canada, the huge real
estate company that owns a chunk of Campeau Corp., promised Campeau
in September to try to secure an $800 million bridge loan to keep
the retailers solvent.
   The Campeau official said that if Olympia and York can't arrange
the loan and the companies can't sell off assets fast enough to
stay solvent, ``Bankruptcy is spelled out as a possibility given
certain circumstances,'' possibly as early as January.
   What effect bankruptcy protection would have on shoppers is
unclear.
   In Cincinnati, Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger said that if
Federated and Allied sought Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy
protection, their stores would remain open. Chapter 11 allows
companies to continue operating while trying to repay creditors.
   Ms. Sanger said the debt burden is becoming increasingly
difficult for the companies to manage.
   Difficulty in meeting earlier debt payments prompted the
September restructuring that ousted Robert Campeau as board
chairman when Olympia and York bailed out the company.
   Campeau put Bloomingdale's, its leading retailer, up for sale
after announcing the restructuring. Federated is negotiating with
six bidders to sell Bloomingdale's to repay a $1.05 billion
short-term loan by April 30.
   Among Federated's other holdings is Lazarus department stores,
based in Cincinnati; Abraham &amp; Straus in New York; Burdines in
Miami, and Rich's and the Goldsmith stores in Atlanta and Memphis,
Tenn.
   Allied Stores' operations include Boston-based Jordan Marsh,
Maas Brothers-Jordan Marsh in Florida, Bon Marche in Seattle and
Stern's in New Jersey.
   Campeau stock tumbled 1 point to close at 4 in over-the-counter
trading Wednesday largely on rumors of a possible bankruptcy
filing, analysts said.

   Pan American World Airlines and USAir Group Inc.
said they are beginning inspection and modification programs for
older jets because of potential problems caused by aging.
   Pan Am said Wednesday it signed a $52.5 million contract with
Boeing Military Airplanes in Wichita, Kan., for structural
modifications on 13 of Pan Am's older 747s.
   In addition to the 13 planes, Boeing will continue modifications
to Pan Am 747s under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program which
prepares aircraft for Air Force use in case of national emergency.
   The modifications, begun on 18 747s in 1985, cost about $11
million per plane. Boeing also has conducted other updates to the
planes, costing about $6 million each during the program.
   Pan Am said 10 more of its 747s will be upgraded at its
maintenance center at Kennedy Airport in New York, with all 747
upgrading completed by 1993, said Robert Gould, senior vice
president of operations.
   USAir has also begun inspecting and repairing 50 of its oldest
DC-9s. The airline, based in Washington, D.C., has 75 McDonnell
Douglas DC-9s, delivered from 1967 to 1982.
   Older Boeing planes have been subjected to inspections and
modifications ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration as a
result of findings and recommendations of an industry task force.
   Larry Pickett, USAir spokesman in Los Angeles, said one DC-9 has
been examined and another is about halfway through the month-long
process. The work is being done in Pittsburgh.
   The industry effort to inspect older planes followed the 1988
Aloha Airlines incident in which the top of the fuselage of a 737
tore off in flight, killing a flight attendant.

   Swissair and Singapore Airlines
announced Thursday they have signed a new cooperation agreement and
plan to finalize details of a 5 percent share-swap accord by the
end of 1990.
   The agreement established the third link in a global alliance
between the two airlines and Delta Air Lines of the United States,
according to a statement issued after the signing ceremony in
Zurich.
   Swissair, Switzerland's national flag carrier, and Singapore
Airlines both signed bilateral agreements with Atlanta-based Delta
earlier in the year.
   The new accord provides for coordination of flight schedules
between Switzerland and Singapore and for cooperation in marketing,
the statement said.
   ``Together with Delta, we are the world's first truly global
travel system,'' said Singapore Airlines Chairman Cheong Choong
Kong.
   Swissair has 55 aircraft serving 110 destinations in 68
countries. It carried a total of 8.1 million passengers and 267,000
metric tons of cargo in 1988.
   Singapore Airlines operates 39 jets to 57 cities in 37
countries. It transported 6.2 million passengers and 240,000 metric
tons of cargo last year.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
advancing Wednesday's gains amid concern about the market impact of
the cold weather.
   Some traders say frigid temperatures in the Eastern United
States will boost domestic demand for feed grains and soybean meal
as livestock producers increase feedings.
   But others see the freezing of waterways as slowing grain
shipments, a bearish factor.
   ``The ultimate disaster would be if it slows shipping to the

director of research with the futures brokerage Allendale Inc.
   Forecasts for continued hot, dry weather in southern Brazil, the
world's No. 2 soybean producer, supported the soybean market.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 1\ cents higher

   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading, led by
pork prices, reflecting the belief that the bitter cold
temperatures in the Midwest are slowing the movement of hogs to
market.
   Live cattle futures were .22 cent to .52 cent higher with
December at 77.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .50

frozen pork bellies were .83 cent to 1.10 cents higher with
February at 53 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Wednesday.

   A computer disk on AIDS that was mailed to
thousands of people in Europe, Africa and California contains a
``virus'' that has sabotaged information in some personal
computers, police and news reports said.
   Scotland Yard said in a statement Wednesday that electronic
codes on the floppy disks that carry information on the deadly
immune-stripping human virus have destroyed information in at least
10 computers in Britain.
   At least 10,000 copies of the ``AIDS Information Introductory
Diskette'' were sent, said a Scotland Yard spokeswoman, who by
custom was not identified.
   The London newspaper The Independent reported today that rumors
in the computer world put the figure much higher and that hospital
systems were among those damaged. It said the disks also turned up
in California, Belgium and Zimbabwe but gave no details about
precisely where.
   Officials and news reports reported that people in Sweden,
Norway and Denmark also received the disk on acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   In California, the Santa Monica-based Rand Corp. warned its
employees about the disk but said its computers have not been
affected.
   John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus Industry Association
in Santa Clara, Calif., said Chase Manhattan Bank was one of the
first companies to report problems with the software, but he did
not elaborate. The company's office in New York was not immediately
available for comment.
   Computer viruses are pieces of software that reproduce
themselves and spread from one machine to another through infected
floppy disks, office networks or telephone lines. They erode a
computer's processing power and storage space, or destroy
information.
   The Guardian newspaper said the disks' program contains ``a
Trojan horse computer virus'' that attacks IBM personal computers.
International Business Machines is one of the world's biggest
makers of computers.
   Among those reported to have received the disks are the London
Stock Exchange; British Telecommunications PLC, which runs most of
the nation's telephone network; the Midland Bank; Lloyds Bank; the
Australia and New Zealand Bank in London; universities; hospitals
and public health laboratories.
   In Sweden, the State Bacteriological Laboratory sent letters to
clinics and doctors working with AIDS warning them about the disk.
Swedish radio said many of the 6,500 people who attended on
international conference on AIDS in Stockholm last year are
believed to have received one.
   Five doctors at Ullevaal Hospital in Oslo, Norway, also received
the disk, said Dr. Jan Doblough of the infection ward.
   The alarm was first raised Tuesday by Dr. Alan Solomon, chairman
of the IBM Personal Computer User Group, who said he received one
of the disks on Monday.
   CW Communications, which publishes PC Business World magazine,
confirmed that the virus was sent out using a 7,000-name mailing
list which it sold to a company called Ketema Associates.
   Martin Durham, managing director of CW Communications,
criticized ``the use of our mailing list for this sort of reckless
tomfoolery.''
   To help its readers, PC Business World said it was offering a
free disk to anyone whose programs were affected by the diskette.

<HEAD>Mesa LP Eliminates Distribution</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf to CORRECT that prices are quoted in thousand
cubic feet</HEAD>

   Mesa Limited Partnership, the energy company run
by takeover strategist T. Boone Pickens, announced today it would
stop paying unitholders a cash distribution next year because of
low prices for natural gas, which account for 80 percent of its
holdings.
   Mesa said it would pay its 37.5 cents distribution for the
fourth quarter, but ``discontinue cash distribution to the common
units until industry conditions and cash flow improve.''
   The news sent Mesa units tumbling in active trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, where prices fell $1.12{ to $7.87{.
   ``The drop in natural gas prices has clearly been a problem for
Mesa, as it has been for the entire industry,'' Pickens said in a
letter to unitholders.
   He said in 1985, the partnership's average gas price was $2.68
per thousand cubic feet and has declined each year to an average of
about $1.65 per thousand cubic feet in 1989. If prices had held at
$2.68, he said, the partnership's cash flow would have been $400
million greater.
   Pickens said the distribution policy will be reviewed quarterly.
The cut does not affect preference unitholders, who will continue
to receive 37.5 cents for six additional quarters.
   The announcement is the second time this year Mesa has cut its
distribution. In March, the partnership cut its payout from 50
cents per unit. To maintain that high distribution, Mesa had used
stock profits and asset sales to cover any gaps.
   In an effort to reduce debt, Mesa also announced today the
creation of a Hugoton Royalty Trust made up of Mesa's holdings in
the Hugoton field in Kansas, the nation's largest natural gas
field. Mesa said the interest will be sold in a public offering
next year and is expected to bring in $300 million.
   ``I remain a believer in natural gas,'' wrote Pickens, who said
90 percent of his net worth is tied up in Mesa. ``Never has more
been written and spoken about the environmental superiority of gas
and the competitive advantages of gas over oil.
   ``About 80 percent of Mesa's reserves are natural gas _ we have
placed our bet,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles eat only pizza, but
Burger King Corp. is hoping the swashbuckling terrapins and other
pre-adolescent idols will come to the rescue of the nation's No. 2
fast-food chain.
   With sales sluggish and market share dipping, Miami-based Burger
King will court youngsters with an ambitious advertising and
promotional campaign scheduled to begin next month.
   The Kids Club _ with toy give-aways and a gang of contemporary
cartoon characters _ aims directly at the grade-school market long
dominated by rival McDonald's Corp. and its orange-haired
ambassador Ronald, analysts say.
   ``The kids are a link to our future business and they heavily
influence where a family might go to eat,'' says Burger King
spokeswoman Cori Zywotow.
   The first sign of Kids Club will appear at Burger King's 5,400
U.S. restaurants on Jan. 1 with special meals that include toy cars
shaped like french fries and other fast-food mainstays. Future
prizes include Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle badges and figures from
the Beetlejuice cartoon series.
   Applications also will be available for Kids Club membership,
which includes stickers, other goodies and a subscription to a
newsletter published five times a year.
   But the centerpiece of the 18-month-old project is the seven
Kids Club characters, a sort-of ultra-hip ``Our Gang'' with an
absent-minded computer genius; a voracious food expert, and
Spanky's leading role taken over by Kid Zid, who moves between the
``real'' world and a high-technology realm of video and electronics.
   Other characters include a girl obsessed with photography; a
cheerful lad in a turbo-charged wheelchair and a tom-boy who speaks
in sports cliches. Their mascot: a stray dog.
   ``Most kids will be able to identify with at least one of the
Kids Club members,'' said Ms. Zywotow. ``Kids today are
sophisticated beyond our imagines ... you need to speak their
language.''
   Right now, Burger King executives are speaking about wide-spread
changes following a 3 percent rise in sales since London-based
Grand Metropolitan PLC acquired the company and its parent
Pillsbury Co. in January.
   Plans include revamping and expanding Burger King's menu and
upgrading service and conditions at franchise-owned outlets, which
comprise about 85 percent of the 5,900 Burger Kings worldwide.
   Problems in food quality and restaurant atmosphere have been
cited as contributing to Burger King's slide from 17.5 percent of
the $61 billion fast- food market in 1987 to 16.8 percent last year.
   Burger King's $5.4 billion in sales last year compares with more
than $17 billion at Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's, which
operates about 10,500 restaurants. No. 3 Hardee's posted sales of
about $3 billion in 1988.
   Burger King has average store sales of about $1 million.
McDonald's outlets average about $1.6 million and Hardee's
restaurants sell about $920,000 apiece annually.
   The Kids Club will debut just 12 weeks after Burger King
unveiled a nationwide advertising campaign focusing on adults and
teens. The Kids Club commercials mostly will air Saturday morning,
where the line between entertainment and advertising often is hazy.
   ``Children control an incredible amount of money by influencing
where adults shop and eat _ and this is particularly true with
fast-food restaurants,'' said Peggy Charren, president of Action
for Children's Television in Cambridge, Mass.
   ``For Burger King to move back to this type of approach sends
the message that influencing children through advertising must work
quite well,'' said Ms. Charren, sponsor of a Senate bill to limit
commercial time on Saturday morning children's programs.
   But it's uncertain how successful Burger King will be against
McDonald's, which has ruled the children's fast-food market through
Saturday morning commercials and tie-ins between its Happy Meals
and such popular movies as Walt Disney Co.'s ``The Little Mermaid.''
   ``McDonald's has been very successful at the children's
market,'' said Laurie Lively, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co Inc.
in New York. ``They've been doing it well for a long time.''
   Daniel Lee, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York,
said some studies indicate Ronald McDonald is the second most
recognizable figure for pre-school children behind Santa Claus.
   ``Try putting a couple of kids in a car and driving past a
McDonald's,'' said Lee. ``It's hard. That's something McDonald's
has been working on for years and years and years.''

<HEAD>Say B-2 Maker Puts HQ Building Up for Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troubled defense contractor Northrop Corp.,
maker of the B-2 Stealth bomber, plans to sell its tony
headquarters complex in Century City to raise cash, company
officials say.
   ``In order to reduce our debt, we're actively looking at the
sale of our non-operating assets,'' spokesman Tony Cantafio was
quoted as telling Copley Los Angeles Newspapers in a story
published today.
   Northrop is not the first aerospace company to try to cash in on
real estate recently as prospects for defense work have dimmed.
Last month, F-14 maker Grumman Corp. said it would redevelop nearly
half its 500-acre Long Island headquarters with a hotel, shopping
center and offices.
   Northrop sent information packages to 10 prospective buyers on
its two Century Park East buildings about a month ago, asking
$247.5 million for them, said Mike DeSantis, a vice president of
the Cushman &amp; Wakefield real estate brokerage.
   De Santis said that price represents the same cost per square
foot that was paid last year for the nearby Fox Plaza, where former
President Ronald Reagan, billionaire investor Marvin Davis, and
20th Century Fox have their offices.
   Potential buyers were not disclosed.
   Northrop's stock has traded as high as $35.75 during the past
year, but closed Wednesday at less than half that level, $17.50 per
share.
   It was up $1 in early trading today on a Los Angeles Times
report that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had decided to build all
132 of the B-2 stealth bombers, a program that accounts for half
Northrop's sales.
   At $18.50 per share, Northrop's 47 million shares of common
stock would be worth about $870 million _ far less than the
company's $1.2 billion debt.
   The $870 million is also less than than the value of the
company's real estate holdings, according to aerospace analyst
Lawrence Harris at the Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards brokerage in
Los Angeles.
   Northrop Chairman Thomas Jones told shareholders at the annual
meeting in May the company might sell properties no longer ``useful
in our plans.''
   Northrop owns manufacturing plants in Southern California,
Illinois, Massachusetts and Oklahoma, but those properties are not
for sale.

   General Mills Inc. reported record
second-quarter earnings Thursday, a 24.3 percent gain over the year
earlier that the company attributed to strength in its food and
restaurant businesses.
   The company said it earned $91.4 million or $1.11 a share for
the three months ended Nov. 26, vs. $73.5 million or 96 cents a
share in the comparable 1988 quarter.
   For the first half of its fiscal year, the company reported
earnings of $206.3 million, compared with $297.3 million last year.
Earnings per share for the first half were $2.50, compared with
$3.62 in the 1988 period.
   Sales for the second quarter this year grew 16 percent to $1.6
billion and, for the first six months, increased 14 percent to $3.1
billion.
   ``Our results to date keep us well on the path toward another
year of record sales, earnings and earnings per share,'' said
Chairman Bruce Atwater.
   Restaurants led General Mills' strong second-quarter operating
performance with increases in sales and operating profits of 18
percent and 40 percent, respectively.
   Consumer Foods' second-quarter gains in sales and operating
profits were 16 percent and 13 percent, respectively, the company
said.

<TEXT>
   The United States has increased protection to some
domestic industries and added import restraints while pressing for
eased barriers abroad, the group that sponsors world trade talks
said Thursday.
   A report by the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade said even though the United States has low tariffs and
trade impediments in most sectors, large trade and current account
deficits had increased pressure for more restrictions against
imports.
   The report reflected the concerns of many countries over the
apparent U.S. trend towards bypassing internationally agreed GATT
procedures and resorting to arbitrary measures to promote its trade
interests.
   The GATT secretariat report formed part of the first evaluation
of U.S. policy to be carried out under a new trade policy review
mechanism agreed by ministers in Montreal last December.
   In a separate report submitted to the GATT council in Geneva as
part of the same evaluation, the U.S. government said its trade
policy was aimed at reducing trade distortions and barriers, both
in the United States and abroad, to allow market forces to operate
and boost trade expansion.
   ``We are totally committed to ... an open and fair trade
policy,'' Rufus Yerxa, U.S. ambassador to GATT, told the Council
meeting.
   ``Those who believe the United States can solve its trade or
economic problems by erecting high trade barriers ... are living in
the age of the dinosaur,'' he said.
   Yerxa said he regarded the GATT secretariat report as
``generally fair,'' commenting that such an evaluation of trade
policy was bound to be critical in parts.
   A text of his speech was made available to journalists.
   A trade source who attended the closed council session said the
meeting was balanced between criticism and praise for U.S. trade
policy.
   Some delegates told the meeting they recognized the U.S. economy
was open and that it was the largest market for exports from many
areas, including developing countries, the source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Other participants commended the few import restrictions and
subsidies outside agriculture, he added.
   The GATT report said that the high U.S. trade deficits had
increased popular domestic pressure for increased protection.
   It welcomed attempts by Washington to resist calls for greater
import restrictions, citing the refusal of the Reagan
administration in 1984 to grant import relief to the copper
industry, and a similar refusal a year later to the footwear
industry.
   However, the number of sectors receiving protection and the
number of restrictive agreements had increased over the years the
report said, listing examples including machine tools and
semiconductors.
   Other sectors of the economy such as dairy, sugar, textiles and
clothing historically have received relatively high levels of
protection, the secretariat said, and little has been done to
reduce the restraints.
   The 97 members of GATT account for more than four fifths of
world trade.

<HEAD>Woman Awarded $43.2 Million in Fiery Auto Accident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman whose husband and two daughters burned to
death in a 1982 auto accident has been awarded $43.2 million by a
jury that found Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. negligent in the design
of its Corona station wagon.
   The jury Wednesday ruled in favor of Nike Adegbite, 36, who
escaped from the 1973 Toyota with minor burns and cuts after it was
rear-ended by a van and burst into flames.
   Douglas West, vice president and general counsel for Toyota
Motors in Torrance, Calif., said the company is surprised by the
verdict and will ask for a new trial.
   ``This is the only claim that Toyota has ever received on that
issue,'' West said. He said Toyota denies the design was defective.
   Stan Pfeiffer, Mrs. Adegbite's attorney, said she and her family
were in the back seat of the station wagon when it was struck. The
gas tank was pushed forward and punctured by a spare tire carrier
and a valve on the rear axle, he said.
   Mrs. Adegbite's husband, Adeyemi, 35, and her daughters,
Yetunde, 7, and Adeloa, 8 months, were killed. The driver, Boyo
Adetoye, received minor injuries, but his wife and child were
killed. Adetoye was not involved in the case.
   Pfeiffer said there was no formal recall of the station wagon,
and he didn't know of any similar cases involving that particular
model.
   But he said that there were only limited sales of that
particular station wagon _ about 50,000 _ in the United States that
year, and that the design was changed the following year.
   Mrs. Adegbite, a beautician, went back to her native Nigeria
after the accident. She returned to Houston for the trial, said
Pfeiffer.

<HEAD>Eliminates Cash Distribution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low natural gas prices have forced Mesa Limited
Partnership to scrap cash distributions and sell assets to reduce
debt, the energy company run by takeover strategist T. Boone
Pickens announced Thursday.
   Pickens said stopping the cash distribution, akin to a dividend
payment to shareholders in a corporation, was necessary to maintain
Mesa's ``financial integrity while gas prices remain low.''
   Besides cutting out its 37.5-cent per unit quarterly
distribution, Mesa said it will package its holdings in the Hugoton
natural gas field into a separate royalty trust and sell shares to
raise $300 million to pay down its $1.5 billion in long-term debt,
much of it left over from last year's $715 million purchase of
natural gas properties from Tenneco Inc.
   The news sent Mesa units tumbling in active trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, where prices had fallen $1.37{ to $7.62{ by
mid-afternoon.
   Until earlier this year, Mesa had paid out $2 a year to each
unitholder, even though revenue from its holdings fell far short of
justifying the payout. The difference had been made up from
Pickens' stock plays involving such companies as Gulf Oil Corp.,
Phillips Petroleum Co and Unocal.
   Pickens defended the practice Thursday, calling it a way of
``prepaying'' unitholders profits from high gas prices in the
future.
   Mesa still has about $400 million worth of cash and marketable
securities, said Bill Ballew, a Mesa financial official.
   In March, Mesa announced a cut in third and fourth quarter
payments to 37.5 cents, and analysts had been expecting a further
reduction although some were surprised the distribution was
eliminated.
   Charles Strain, an analyst with Lovett, Underwood, Newhouse and
Webb Inc. in Houston, said Mesa could only justify a payout of 30
cents a year based on current gas prices, ``so this makes sense.''
   ``The drop in natural gas prices has clearly been a problem for
Mesa, as it has been for the entire industry,'' Pickens said in a
letter to unitholders.
   ``In 1985, our average gas price was $2.68 per thousand cubic
feet; it has declined each year to an average of about $1.65
thousand cubic feet in 1989. If prices had held at $2.68 per
thousand cubic feet during the four years 1986-1089, our cash flow
would have been $400 million greater.''
   The current December price is about $1.85; it is expected to
rise above $2 in January.
   The price should rise to about $2.50 per thousand cubic feet if
oil remains in the $20-a-barrel range, Strain said.
   At that level, he said, Mesa would be profitable.
   ``We didn't make any money this year, but there is a good
possibility that we're going to make money in the mid- to late
90s,'' Ballew said.
   Most observers expect the price of natural gas to continue
rising as demand catches up to supply. The fuel frequently is
touted as a domestically available, safe, clean replacement for
gasoline.
   Mesa said the 37.5 cent distribution would be paid for the
fourth quarter, giving unitholders $1.75 per unit this year, but it
will ``discontinue cash distribution to the common units until
industry conditions and cash flow improve.''
   Pickens, who owns 4.3 million common units, said the
distribution policy will be reviewed quarterly. The cut does not
affect preference unitholders, who will continue to receive 37.5
cents for six additional quarters.
   To immediately raise money, Mesa said it would create the
Hugoton Royalty Trust from its holdings in the Hugoton field in
Kansas, the nation's largest natural gas field. Mesa said shares in
the trust will be sold in a public offering next year and are
expected to bring in $300 million.
   Twice in the past, Mesa has packaged holdings into trusts,
shares of which were distributed to unitholders. This time,
however, ``we needed the money,'' Ballew said.
   Pickens said the company would remain a limited partnership
because under that structure it doesn't pay pay federal income
taxes.
   ``I remain a believer in natural gas,'' wrote Pickens. ``About
80 percent of Mesa's reserves are natural gas _ we have placed our
bet.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Gain On New-Crop Supply Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by modest
gains in the soybean market amid concerns about new-crop supplies.
   The new-crop soybean contracts _ those for delivery next fall _
gained the most, as they have for most of this week.
   Traders are speculating that U.S. farmers will plant fewer
soybeans in 1990 than this year and devote more acreage to corn,
wheat and cotton to take advantage of government-guaranteed prices
for those crops in the last year of the current Farm Bill, said Ann
Frick, senior soybean analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   New crop soybeans also were supported by increasing fears of a
drought in the prime soybean-growing region of Brazil.
   Buying of corn, wheat and old-crop soybean futures was linked in
part to ideas that bitter cold in the Eastern United States would
lead to increased domestic livestock feeding.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2\ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.16\ a bushel; corn
futures were } cent lower to 1} cents higher with December at $2.35
a bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent higher with December at
$1.43} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 4\ cents higher with
January at $5.82{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 469 money market mutual
funds fell $336.3 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $366.81 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $431.4 million drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $368.23 billion in the week
ended Nov. 21, 1989.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 228 general purpose funds rose $148.8 million to $119.68
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds fell $97.7 million to
$158.93 billion, and assets of 144 institutional funds declined
$387.4 million to $88.20 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.90 percent from 7.94 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.95 percent from 7.97 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, down from 44 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.35 percent as of Wednesday from 6.37 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.08 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.98
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.01
percent the previous week. Yields were 8.00 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 8.04 percent; 7.96 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.98
percent; and 7.96 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 7.99 percent.

<HEAD>Canada Registers First Trade Deficit In 13 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's merchandise trade during October
registered a deficit for the first time in 13 years, the government
reported Thursday, fueling concern about a recession.
   Canada imported $421 million more goods than it sold abroad in
October, compared with a revised surplus of $134 million in
September, Statistics Canada reported.
   The October trade figures were much worse than analysts were
projecting. A surplus of about $200 million had been expected.
   ``The likelihood of a recession is rising every day,'' said
Ernie Stokes, an economist at WEFA Group, an economic research firm
based in Toronto.
   The federal agency said the worst monthly trade performance
since March 1976 was the result of imports growing much faster than
exports as the high-flying Canadian dollar makes Canadian goods
more expensive on foreign markets.
   In recent weeks, the Canadian dollar has risen to nine-year
highs of more than 86 U.S. cents as the Bank of Canada keeps
interest rates higher than rates in the United States to fight
inflation.
   John Crow, governor of the Bank of Canada, is expected to stick
with his policy of using high interest rates to slow the economy
and keep a lid on consumer prices and wage demands.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed In Dull Trading</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede BC-LONDON</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed Thursday in dull
trading on world currency markets.
   Gold prices slipped overseas but appeared to stabilize in U.S.
dealings after Wednesday's steep plunge.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $408.30 a troy ounce, up 20 cents from late
Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $408.30 an ounce, up 30 cents.
   Traders said the market was extremely quiet. ``Everybody is on
the sidelines,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Dealers and investors are awaiting Friday's release of key U.S.
economic data. The government is scheduled to report merchandise
trade figures for October and producer prices and industrial
production data for November.
   The figures will offer ``a lot to react to,'' said Marc
Chandler, an analyst with Chicago-based Money Market Services
International. But he noted that ``we don't have full liquidity in
the market _ it's sort of the holiday thinness.''
   Dealers have been expecting October's trade deficit to register
somewhere between $9 billion and $10 billion. But the Canadian
government's report Thursday showing the nation's first monthly
trade deficit in 13 years was cause for some speculation that the
U.S. deficit may have benefitted.
   Canada imported 421 million Canadian dollars more goods than it
sold abroad in October, compared with a revised surplus of 134
million in September, Statistics Canada reported.
   ``A lot of people track the two against each other since Canada
is our largest trading partner,'' Flanagan said.
   But others suggested Canada's weak showing may reflect a
slowdown in the U.S. economy. Chandler said that since Canada's
major exports to the United States are autos and auto parts, a
decline in U.S. auto buying may have contributed to Canada's
shortfall.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 144.07 Japanese yen, from
143.70 yen on Wednesday. But later in London, it fell to 144.00
yen. In New York, the dollar finished at 144.15 yen, up from 144.05
yen late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5970 from $1.5955 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.6010 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Wednesday's $1.6000.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.7344 West German marks, up from 1.7280;
1.5630 Swiss francs, down from 1.5645; 5.9285 French francs, up
from 5.9070; 1.1598 Canadian dollars, unchanged; and 1,292.25
Italian lire, up from 1,289.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.7375 West German marks, down from 1.7390; 1.5630 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5965; 5.9420 French francs, down from 5.9475;
1.9565 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9430; 1,295.75 Italian lire, down
from 1,296.25; and 1.1585 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $407.50 a troy ounce
from $411.25 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal
fell to a closing bid of $408.50 from $411.00 bid late Wednesday.
Gold in Hong Kong fell $6.08 to close at a bid $408.65.
   Silver prices were mixed. In London silver bullion fell to a
late bid price of $5.58 a troy ounce from $5.59 bid late Wednesday.
But on New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery
finished at $5.557 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's $5.544.

<TEXT>
   Going to a shopping mall to buy a robot
may sound like a futuristic fantasy, but Jean Du Teau is gambling
in the present on science fiction becoming fact.
   Du Teau owns Robot World, a retail robot store tucked into a
Rochester shopping center next to a maternity boutique and an
optician's shop.
   Visitors are greeted at the door by RB5X, a small, gray figure
with a shiny domed head who chirps ``Hello stranger.''
   Du Teau, France-born president of Rochester Robotics Inc.,
opened Robot World in June to meet what he sees as a need for
robots for the general public.
   While Rochester Robotics makes robots for nuclear power plant
inspection and modifies service robots for business use, Robot
World sells mostly educational and hobby models to schools and
computer enthusiasts. But Du Teau says it won't be long before most
of his sales are to people buying personal robots for their homes.
   ``Robots are today where computers were 10 years ago,'' he said.
``Most people perceive that the robotic age is going to happen in
the year 2000. The robotic age is here.''
   The store's products range from RoboDuck, a $29 beginner's robot
for children, to RB5X, which costs $2,700 and is Robot World's
biggest seller to schools.
   Cost is the main thing standing between most Americans and their
own personal robots, Du Teau said. He expects prices to begin
dropping as the number of new products grows. That, he said, is
happening already.
   Not everyone in the robot business is quite as optimistic.
Household robots are coming, other experts say, but they don't all
agree on when.
   ``We're still quite a ways from a robot in every house,'' said
Jeff Burnstein, managing director of National Service Robot
Association, an industry group based in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   Burnstein said robot technology is still developing. There just
aren't many home robots ready to be marketed that can do anything
useful, he said.
   ``People think that there's a market out there for home robots,
but there just aren't products.''
   Dozens, maybe hundreds of researchers are working on robots,
Burnstein said. He believes the main obstacle to getting them on
the market is the lack of a major backer for robot products.
   Burnstein thinks the robot revolution will happen sometime in
the next decade.
   ``I don't think we're talking about 30 to 50 years away,'' he
said. ``It's just a matter of when there's going to be a big
breakthrough.''
   Dana Ballard, a computer science professor and robotics
researcher at the University of Rochester, sees the breakthrough as
still further off, perhaps 20 to 50 years away.
   Recent advances in technology have sped up robotics research,
Ballard said. Many problems need to be solved before home robots
can be made viable.
   ``I don't think these things are going to be translated into
marketable items in the near future,'' he said. ``Putting the whole
thing together is going to take a while.''
   Like Du Teau and Burnstein, however, Ballard believes that there
will someday be a robot in every house.
   ``I think there'll be a whole spectrum of machines that have
various sorts of motor capabilities,'' he said. ``It's hard to
envision the form of these things because they haven't been thought
of yet.''
   Home robots are unlikely to be all-purpose human-like creatures
such as the lovable R2D2 character in Star Wars. A simple _ for
humans _ task like getting a drink out of the refrigerator involves
a whole series of extremely complicated procedures for a robot, Du
Teau said.
   ``To have a robot that does everything _ we're a long way from
that,'' he said. ``If we had a robot that would clean house we
could retire by now.''
   More likely are robots that perform specific functions _ such as
dishwashing, pool cleaning or security.
   Security robots that roam the house, detect any usual movement
or sounds and call the police, will be among the first home robots
on the market in the next few months, Du Teau said.
   Other robots that Du Teau says will be in the store by January
include ``The Lawn Ranger,''a computerized self-propelled lawn
mower, and Newton, a robot that can do multiple duty as a security
guard, answering machine, alarm clock and language teacher for
children.
   ``It's somewhat of a gimmick, but it's a nice gimmick because it
has purpose,'' Du Teau said.
   Purpose is what separates the new breed of robots from the smart
but generally useless robots that made a brief foray onto the
market in the early 1980s, Burnstein said.
   At least six home robot products that will be on the market in
the next few months, with more to follow next summer, Du Teau said.
And while other entrepreneurs scramble to get in on the boom he's
sure is coming, Du Teau is already there _ and already planning
more branches.
   ``To me the most important thing is we're the first,'' he said.
``We are pioneers.''

<HEAD>Ford, Japanese Automakers Gain in Market Share</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese automakers, who built U.S. assembly
plants at near breakneck speed in the mid- and late-1980s, are
realizing the benefits of assembling cars on the other side of the
Pacific.
   Since late 1985, only the Japanese and Ford Motor Co. have
increased their shares of the U.S. car market.
   General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp. and European automakers
lost a share of the market, which itself decreased by 10.1 percent
to about 9.2 million cars on Nov. 30.
   ``I think their market share will continue to erode over the
next decade,'' said auto analyst Mary O'Neill of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
in Chicago. ``Non-U.S. producers have about 30 percent market share.
   ``It could go up to 40 (percent) in the next five years. In
addition, the Japanese imports haven't fallen as much as people
have expected.''
   At the end of November 1985, GM commanded 42.7 percent of the
U.S. car market, a level that fell to 35 percent at the end of last
month. Chrysler had 11.3 percent back then and 10.4 percent at the
end of last month.
   Ford boosted its share to 22.3 percent from 18.9 percent and
vehicles built by Japanese companies cornered 25.8 percent of the
market last month, compared with 21.3 percent four years earlier.
   The so-called ``transplants'' lifted the Japanese automakers'
shares. Without them, market share for the Japanese companies fell
to 18.1 percent last month from 19.7 percent in 1985.
   The Japanese transplants' rise to 7.7 percent of the market last
month from 1.7 percent four years ago prompted United Auto Workers
union President Owen Bieber to renew a call for export restraints
from the government in Tokyo.
   In a letter this week to Trade Minister Hikaru Matsunaga, the
leader of the 1-million-member UAW urged the Japanese government to
slash vehicle exports to 1.5 million units in 1990 from the current
2.3 million.
   Bieber said such a reduction ``would demonstrate the government
of Japan's commitment to reducing the bilateral trade imbalance and
to replacing high levels of auto imports into the U.S. with
vehicles produced here.''
   The current export levels under the Japanese voluntary restraint
agreement come up for annual review next March.
   Spokesmen for Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mazda, each of whom have
assembly plants in the United States, said Thursday it was too
early to tell for sure if they would meet restraint levels this
year.
   However, officials for Toyota, Nissan and Mazda said it was
unlikely that the quotas would be met.
   The main reason for that is production at their U.S. plants.
   Back in 1985, the only Japanese companies with U.S. factories
were Honda, with a plant in Marysville, Ohio; and Nissan, with a
plant in Smyrna, Tenn. Since then, Honda has added a plant in East
Liberty, Ohio, and Nissan announced an expansion of the Smyrna
plant that will boost production to about 440,000 vehicles a year
by 1992.
   Meantime, Toyota set up its own plant in Georgetown, Ky.; Mazda
established a plant in Flat Rock, Mich.; Toyota and GM are in a
joint venture in Fremont, Calif.; Mitsubishi and Chrysler are
making cars in Normal, Ill.; and two Japanese automakers _ Subaru
and Isuzu _ are making vehicles in Lafayette, Ind.
   The UAW has organized Mazda's and the GM-Toyota and
Mitsubishi-Chrysler joint venture plants.

<TEXT>
   Michael P. Sandler, publisher of the Daily
Racing Form for nearly 16 years, will retire at yearend and remain
an advisor to the publication, it was announced Thursday.
   Martin Singerman, president of Racing Form's parent News America
Publishing Inc., said he would become president of the publication
and William H. Williams, general manager of the Racing Form's
eastern edition, would be promoted to national general manager.
   No one will assume the title of publisher.
   Sandler has been publisher of Daily Racing Form since February
1974. Between 1944 and 1972, he served as circulation manager,
assistant general manager and general manager of the Los Angeles
edition of the publication, which prints articles and extensive
statistical information on U.S. thoroughbred horse racing.
   News America, a unit Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. media empire,
acquired Daily Racing Form, TV Guide, Seventeen magazine and a
number of other publications when it bought Triangle Publications
Inc. for $3 billion in August 1988.
   ``Michael Sandler is the person most responsible for bringing
the Daily Racing Form to its present level of success,'' Singerman
said in a news release. ``We at News America are greatly indebted
to Mike for his guidance and dedication during the transition
period from Triangle to News America.''
   Williams, a former editor and general manager of the Colorado
Springs (Colo.) Free Press, joined Triangle in 1970 as director of
labor relations for the Racing Form. He has been general manager of
the Eastern edition, which is based in Highstown, N.J., since 1972.

<HEAD>Hog Futures Surge On Cold-Weather Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for near-term deliveries of hogs surged more than a penny
per pound Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as frigid
weather in the Midwest slowed marketings and reduced slaughter
rates.
   The cold spell, which is expected to continue through the
weekend, also contributed to gains in the cattle and grain futures
markets.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures retreated and precious
metals were mostly higher.
   Hog futures settled .08 cents to 1.05 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December up 1.05 cents at 52.75 cents a
pound.
   Live cattle futures were .15 cent to .60 cent higher with
December at 77.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .43
cent higher with January at 83.72 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.10 cents to 1.60 cent lower with February at 50.32
cents a pound.
   The gains in hog futures extended a three-month advance from
prices near 40 cents a pound in mid-September.
   Cold weather typically supports the hog market for two reasons:
animals tend to burn energy rapidly in cold weather, causing weight
loss when they are moved around; and farmers, like everyone else,
tend to stay indoors in cold weather.
   ``People don't want to go out and sort their pens. It's too cold
to go out, period,'' said Dale Durchholz, a livestock analyst with
AgriVisor Services Inc., a market advisory service in Bloomington,
Ill.
   Before the cold snap set in this week, hog prices were boosted
by a seasonal surge in wholesale demand for hams. Pork bellies
provided support before that amid speculation that Eastern Europe
would become a major market for U.S. pork bellies.
   ``A series of short-term factors continue to come along and push
it,'' Durchholz said. ``But if we see the weather moderate on us,
we'll probably see a pretty sharp break in the hog market.''
   Pork bellies fell sharply on profit-taking, giving up nearly all
of Wednesday's gains.
   Most grain and soybean futures rose on the Chicago Board of
Trade, paced by modest gains in the soybean market amid concerns
about new-crop supplies.
   Buying of corn, wheat and old-crop soybean futures was linked in
part to ideas that bitter cold in the Eastern United States would
lead to increased domestic livestock feeding.
   The new-crop soybean contracts _ those for delivery next fall _
posted the strongest gains, as they have for most of this week.
   Traders are speculating that U.S. farmers will plant fewer
soybeans in 1990 than this year and devote more acreage to corn,
wheat and cotton to take advantage of government-guaranteed prices
for those crops.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2\ cents higher with December at
$4.16\ a bushel; corn futures were { cent lower to 2 cents higher
with December at $2.35\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent
higher with December at $1.43} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to
3} cents higher with January at $5.82\ a bushel.
   Heating oil futures fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
ending an 11-day upswing.
   The selloff largely reflected profit-taking and analysts said
the bullish factors _ cold weather and shipping problems in Europe
_ remained in place.
   ``I think any setbacks are temporary,'' said William Hinton, a
broker with Stotler &amp; Co. in New York.
   Heating oil futures settled .45 cent to .84 cent lower with
January at 67.28 cents a gallon; West Texas Intermediate crude oil
was 5 cents to 12 cents lower with January at $20.65 a barrel;
unleaded gasoline was .11 cent to .35 cent lower with January at
51.61 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures were little changed while silver advanced slightly
on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 10 cents lower to 20 cents higher with December at
$408.30 a troy ounce; silver was 0.4 cent to 1.3 cents higher with
December at $5.557 a troy ounce.
   Platinum settled $6.40 to $6.60 higher on the New York Merc with
January at $511.30 a troy ounce. Analysts attributed the rally to
technical market factors.

   The Central Bank on Thursday
ordered banks and foreign exchange houses closed Friday in an
emergency holiday, evidently aimed at slowing an alarming loss of
confidence in the austral currency.
   The Central Bank gave no reason for the second bank holiday this
week, except to say it was ordered by the Economy Ministry. The
move was disclosed in a two-paragraph story on the state news
agency Telam late Thursday night.
   But the holiday follows the plunge of the austral against the
U.S. dollar since a 34.5 percent devaluation last Sunday as part of
an austerity program that included massive hikes in public service
rates, export taxes and the suspension of repayment of some
government debts. Banks and foreign exchange houses were ordered
closed thispast Monday because of the devaluation.
   Monthly interest rates soared Thursday to 43 percent for large
depositors, up from about 30 percent the day before and 17 percent
last week.
   ``I know I have lost some credibility, but I will remain in the
Economy Ministry until the president decides otherwise,'' said
embattled Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli.
   Earlier in the day, President Carlos Menem acknowledged there
may be a political price to pay for the economic disorder and the
unpopular austerity measures he implemented this week.
   ``There is flinching and protests when you put in the scalpel to
draw out puss from a wound and it hurts,'' Menem said in an
interview with Radio Argentina. ``There is no other way out of this
situation without some political cost.''
   A recent survey by Radio de Plata indicated Menem's popularity
has waned since he took office last July. Unions are threatening to
strike for wage hikes, and businesses have ignored government pleas
to hold down prices.
   Newspapers in the capital have speculated for days that
Rapanelli will be forced out. Menem, however, insisted that his
economics minister enjoys his ``absolute confidence.''
   Menem also said the controversial program of privatizations and
deregulation will proceed, and the 34.5 percent devaluation and 60
percent and higher hikes in public service rates were unavoidable.
   Argentines who wanted to buy dollars paid 1,560 australs apiece
at the close of the business day, or 14.7 percent more than on
Wednesday and 56 percent more than the official rate, set last
Sunday, of 1,000-1.
   ``There is a lack of confidence in the economic plan,'' said
Ramiro Taboada, a manager at the Bank of Buen Ayre.
   Also, banks and other large investors were buying dollars and
forcing down the austral as a ``a kind of vengeance'' against the
government for suspending for two years the repayment of principal
on dollar-denominated, internal bonds, Toboada said.
   Alfredo Piano, head of the large foreign exchange company that
bears his name, said small investors were simply trying to protect
their money against inflation. ``People are fleeing the austral and
taking refuge in something they consider more solid,'' he said.

   Energy futures weakened Thursday with prices of
wholesale home heating oil taking the biggest tumble.
   The contract for January delivery of No.2 heating oil dropped
0.68 cent to 67.28 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, wiping out the 0.66-cent gain registered Wednesday.
Contracts for delivery during February through April fell by
amounts ranging from 0.70 cent to 0.84 cent.
   The slide in the January heating oil contract ended an 11-day
string of consecutive increases. Analysts said the downturn was
caused by a slump in prices in London for gasoil, the equivalent of
U.S. heating oil.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 12 cents to $20.65 per 42-gallon
barrel. The February through April contracts ended 9 cents to 11
cents lower.
   Among other refined oil products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery, which fell 0.10
cent on Wednesday, lost another 0.32 cent and closed at 51.61 cents
a gallon. Other contracts also closed lower.

<HEAD>Money Supply Growth Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One measure of the nation's money supply rose in
the week ended Dec. 4, while another fell, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,207.4 billion from $3,028.4 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,056.6 billion from $4,052.3 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $789.7 billion from $793.0 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.6 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.9 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,180.1 billion, an 8.0
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,031.2 billion, up 3.4 percent, while M1
rose 6.2 percent to an average of $786.9 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $2.953 billion
in the week ended Dec. 6.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $110 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$150 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $536
million in the two weeks ended Dec. 6, down from $586 million in
the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $294.5 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $294.5 billion two weeks earlier.

   Pinnacle West Capital Corp. ended weeks of
speculation Thursday by announcing it had turned down an
``opportunistic attempt'' by an Oregon-based holding company to buy
Arizona's largest corporation.
   PacifiCorp on Dec. 1 proposed swapping stock to acquire Pinnacle
West in a deal valued at about $1.87 billion. The bid, which was
conditioned upon Pinnacle West's disposing of ailing subsidiary
MeraBank, was an expansion of a Nov. 8 bid by PacifiCorp to buy
Arizona Public Service Co. for $1.7 billion. APS is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Pinnacle West and is Arizona's largest utility.
   ``The board unanimously determined that PacifiCorp's proposal is
inadequate and not in the best interests of Pinnacle West and its
shareholders,'' Pinnacle West Chairman Keith Turley said in a
letter to PacifiCorp President A.M. Gleason.
   Turley's letter continued, ``In reaching these conclusions the
board has carefully considered the business, financial condition
and future prospects of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries
including Arizona Public Service Co. and MeraBank.''
   Mike Nelson, director of financial planning and investor
services for PacifiCorp, said in Portland, Ore., that PacifiCorp
executives were disappointed by the rejection.
   ``I think they're just reacting to the increase in their stock
price this week and last week and at this point, they're not
willing to sit down and talk to us,'' he said of Pinnacle West.
   Pinnacle West's stock nearly doubled Dec. 7, jumping 4~ to 10\,
after the company announced a settlement with federal thrift
regulators concerning MeraBank. The settlement required Pinnacle
West to infuse MeraBank with $450 million.
   Nelson said Turley's letter was the first reaction PacifiCorp
had received to either of its offers.
   In contrast to the silence with which he'd met the much
publicized offer, Turley commented Thursday on the Portland-based
holding company's bid, calling it ``an opportunistic attempt by
PacifiCorp to enhance value for its shareholders at the expense of
our shareholders.''
   He said Pinnacle West's board of directors ``firmly believes
that the best course for Pinnacle West and its shareholders is to
continue our program to resolve the MeraBank issues and build value
for shareholders as an independent company.''
   The Pinnacle West board acted on the opinion of advisers First
Boston Corp. and Salomon Brothers Inc. that the proposal was
``inadequate from a financial point of view,'' Turley said.
Pinnacle West had hired the two investment banking companies to
study the bid.
   Turley concluded the letter by informing Gleason that ``no
purpose would be served'' by future talks between the two companies.
   PacifiCorp's Nelson declined to speculate whether Pinnacle West
was implying PacifiCorp should sweeten its proposal.
   ``I don't know if there's anything between the lines in his
letter in terms of other messages,'' he said.
   As for PacifiCorp's next move, he said: ``We're evaluating that
right now. We don't have any comments on what our plans are as of
yet.
   The rejection was ``not unexpected because at this point the
offer isn't good enough'' given Pinnacle West's stock price, said
Marcia Weeks, a member of the Arizona Corporation Commission, which
regulates APS.
   The commission has scheduled a Monday hearing on the APS
dividend matter.
   A high priority at that hearing will be Pinnacle West's deal
with federal thrift regulators to infuse MeraBank with $300 million
in cash within four months. Pinnacle West also has promised a note
for $150 million spread out over the next 12 years. Pinnacle West
borrowed the cash from four New York firms, using APS stock as
collateral.

   The stock market took a downward turn Thursday
amid renewed worries about the business outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 32.85 points in the
two preceding sessions, dropped 7.46 to 2,753.63.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
529 up, 996 down and 494 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were unsettled by word late Wednesday of
deepening problems in the debt-burdened retailing empire of Campeau
Corp. in Toronto.
   Campeau officials said its Federated Department Stores and
Allied Stores operations might file for bankruptcy protection in
early 1990 if new agreements can't be reached with lenders.
   Adding to the wary mood was anticipation of a quarterly ``triple
witching hour'' on Friday involving a series of expiring options
and futures on stock indexes.
   Also on Friday, the government is due to report the producer
price index for November and the nation's international trade
position for October.
   General Motors fell 1[ to 43{. A prominently featured story in
the Wall Street Journal discussed the company's problems with a

it would stop paying cash distributions next year, citing depressed
prices for natural gas.
   Polygram N.V. led the active list, trading at 16~ after an
initial public offering of 32 million shares at 16 by the company's
parent, Philips N.V.
   UAL fell 5{ to 163\ as hopes continued to dim for a new deal to
replace the planned buyout by an employee-management group that
fell through two months ago. Elsewhere in the airline group, AMR
lost 1 to 63 and Delta Air Lines was down { at 68[.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 178.70 million

consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 210.72 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

<TEXT>
   Fluorocarbon Co., wrongly maligned as an
environmental menace, has picked a new name that doesn't sound like
chlorofluorocarbons, the atmosphere-zapping gases.
   The company, which makes plastic seals, gaskets, bearings and
the like for everything from washing machines to planes, will be
reborn Jan. 1 as Furon Co., Chairman Peter Churm said Thursday.
   Churm launched a name-change contest that captured national
attention last summer because people mistakenly thought his
products wrecked the ozone layer, which screens cancer-causing rays.
   Lynette ``Squeaky' Fromme, the Charles Manson follower who tried
to kill President Ford, had Churm on a hit list. Brokers had
problems selling the stock of the Laguna Niguel-based company.
   More than 10,000 healthy-sounding entries poured in, including
Not Chlorofluorocarbon Inc., Fiber-Fab, Seals R Us, Fluoraluralura,
The Churminators Inc., Laguna Buna, Notox, Pro-Ozone Inc. and Oat
Bran Co.
   But a committee headed by Churm finally decided on Furon _ a
name of their own devising.
   ``What we didn't realize until we got into it were the number of
names we could not use,'' Churm said in a telephone interview.
``We'd get down to three finalists, submit them to patent
attorneys, and find out they were already taken.
   ``For example, we got about 250 entries for Fluorotech, spelled
different ways. Just to see what would happen, we had it checked
and found out there were already seven companies using variations
on it.''
   A favorite name among the Fluorocarbon brass was Fluoron, which
was submitted by eight people, including one shareholder and one
employee, Churm said.
   ``But it was pretty close to fluorine gas, which might be pretty
bad, and there were already two people using Fluoron,'' he said.
``Then we decided that Furon sounded close.''
   The more they considered Furon, the more they liked it.
   ``There's something different about it, and it sort of rolls off
your tongue,'' Churm said. ``The acid test was how it sounds with
the telephone operator, and it turns out it sounds good.''
   Each of the eight winners will get 100 shares of Fluorocarbon _
make that Furon _ stock, which was trading at $13.12{ per share
Thursday.
   Churm was asked if Furon didn't sound as though the company was,
well, angry.
   ``Nah,'' he said. ``I'm never furious about anything.''
   The winners of the contest are: Charles Alexandre of Bristol,
R.I.; Ron Birtcher, Laguna Niguel; Michael S. Cholod, Bensalem,
Pa.; Marvin Felman, Beachwood, Ohio; A.B. Golaski, Philadelphia;
Kelli Griesch, New York; John Temple, Chicago; and Dorothy E.
Western, Lakewood, Colo.

<HEAD>Creditors Group Reaches Settlement in Hunt Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major group of creditors who lost money in the
1979-80 silver market crash has reached a settlement in the Hunt
brothers' bankruptcy case, officials said.
   The settlement is subject to bankruptcy court approval, but
paves the way for confirmation of the bankruptcy cases of William
Herbert Hunt and Nelson Bunker Hunt. Confirmation hearings begin
Friday.
   A group of more than 500 creditors with smaller claims against
the Hunts had threatened to challenge an alliance of the two
bankruptcy cases' largest creditors.
   Under the proposed settlement, some 500 smaller creditors who
suffered trading losses when the Hunts allegedly tried to corner
the world's supply of silver would receive about $9 million of the
$220 million they originally lost when the market crashed.
   ``I'd be optimistic that the cases will be confirmed since all
the significant creditor groups now support the plan,'' Robert
Brousseau, attorney for the silver claimants, told The Dallas
Morning News.
   The brothers' estates have been under Chapter 11 federal
bankruptcy protection since September 1988.
