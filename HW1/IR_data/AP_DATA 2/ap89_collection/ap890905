   Giant Hurricane Gabrielle, its tail winds swamping
homes and businesses as far south as Barbados, may have reached peak
force as its swirling clouds spread further over the Atlantic,
forecasters said late Tuesday.
   Experts, however, said it was too early to draw conclusions from
U.S. Air Force reconnaissance plane readings of rising barometric
pressure and a slightly expanding eye in the hurricane, which
brushed by the U.S. Caribbean islands before turning its 135 mph
winds northward.
   Hurricane forecasters said Gabrielle appeared to be heading
toward the British island of Bermuda in the Atlantic, but was still
at least three days away and on an uncertain course that seemed to
be moving from a northwesterly course to northward.
   ``The biggest threat now is for Bermuda ... Anybody on the East
Coast should watch this storm,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Gabrielle, already this season's biggest hurricane, was upgraded
Tuesday evening to a Category 4 hurricane, with 5 the strongest.
   Forecasters said it rivaled last year's record-setting Hurricane
Gilbert at the same stage, but was on a path more like 1985's
powerful Hurricane Gloria, which did $900 million in damage as it
raced up the East Coast and into New England.
   Sheets said Gabrielle was unlikely to come near South Florida.
   Gabrielle, with storm winds in a 500-mile-long band, caused storm
swells as far as 1,000 miles from its center, forecasters said.
   Sheets compared Gabrielle to Gilbert of 1988, saying Gabrielle's
size was similar to Gilbert, which became ``the storm of the
century'' and devastated the island of Jamaica. Both were the
seventh named storms of their Atlantic season, as was Gloria.
   While Gilbert stayed on a westerly course across the upper
Caribbean and made landfall in Mexico, Gabrielle was moving out of
the Caribbean and headed up into the Atlantic.
   As of 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle was centered near 22.6 north
latitude and 58.5 west longitude, about 775 miles south-southeast of
Bermuda. It was moving northwest at 12 mph.
   The governments of the Leeward Islands countries urged small
craft to stay in port and issued heavy surf warnings as Gabrielle
pushed 74 mph (hurricane-force) winds as far as 100 miles away from
its center.
   Henry Laskosky, a National Weather Service forecaster in San
Juan, predicted rough seas for the island.
   ``It should not bother us at all, except for seas, they'll be a
little rough tonight and Wednesday,'' Laskosky said.
   In Barbados, the easternmost Caribbean island 550 miles southeast
of Puerto Rico, Gabrielle's tail caused 10-foot waves and rough seas
on the island's east coast Monday. Some beachfront homes and
businesses in the capital of Bridgetown were flooded Tuesday.
   No injuries or serious damages were reported.
   The weather in Barbados and Leeward islands on Tuesday was sunny
and clear.
   Forecaster John Toohey said the hurricane would have no effect on
the Virgin Islands.
   Gloria, the last major hurricane on the U.S. East Coast in Sept.
16-Oct. 1, 1985, started on a track similar to Gabrielle. The
hurricane, which moved up the Atlantic at an unusually fast 30 to 50
mph, panicked thousands of coastal residents but turned out not to
be the massive killer hurricane predicted. It was a Category 3 storm
when it hit the coast, but had earlier had winds of 150 mph.
   ``People were very fortunate with Gloria,'' Hurricane Center
spokesman Martin Nelson said. ``The tides were in our favor and it
stayed offshore. We can take all the chastising about crying wolf,
but we're not going to downplay this one because of Gloria.''
   Meanwhile, far to the north, Hurricane Felix was back to 85 mph
winds after falling to 39 mph over the weekend.
   Little additional strengthening was expected for Felix, which was
no threat to land. At 10:30 p.m. EDT, its center was located near
36.5 north latitude and 48.5 west longitude, or about 950 miles west
of the westernmost Azores, and it was barely moving.

   Teachers in Sacramento, Calif., went on strike Tuesday after
contract talks broke down, raising the number of students without
classes to more than 110,000.
   In Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, teachers overwhelmingly ratified a new
two-year contract with the school board, ending the threat of a
strike set for Tuesday.
   Walkouts in 12 districts in Illinois, Michigan, Montana, Ohio and
Pennsylvania affected about 66,000 students as of Labor Day.
   Negotiators worked through the holiday to try to head off a
strike in Sacramento, with 48,000 students the biggest district in
the nation to have a walkout.
   Talks broke down about 3 a.m., and teachers were on strike by 7
a.m., officials said. The teachers want a 12.7 percent raise this
year and are seeking class-size limitations and hiring deadlines for
new teachers.
   Elsewhere in California, teachers without a contract for 14
months embraced a last-minute deal so schools could open Tuesday in
San Jose, the state's third-largest city. Details of the agreement
were not released.
   In Pennsylvania, 378 teachers were on strike in three districts
with 5,700 students.
   Strikes began Tuesday in two of those districts. But a walkout
that began in a fourth district, Perkiomen Valley near Philadelphia
with 2,300 students and 159 teachers, ended in a settlement later in
the day.
   In the Upper St. Clair School District in suburban Pittsburgh, an
all-day negotiating session Monday settled a strike by 225 teachers,
and 3,700 students went back to school Tuesday. Teachers in the
Union School District in western Pennsylvania returned to work on a
daily basis.
   In Massachusetts, the 317 teachers in the Boston suburb of
Everett voted unanimously to go on strike in the second walkout in
three years.
   ``We've never had that anywhere in Massachusetts,'' said
Massachusetts Teachers Association spokesman Stephen Wollmer.
   The district, which has 3,900 students, had been scheduled to
reopen Wednesday.
   Teachers in nearby Chelsea agreed to an unusual six-month
contract with Boston University, which is administering the
3,500-pupil school system in an experiment aimed at improving the
troubled schools. The teachers union said it agreed to the short
contract to give the university time to raise money.
   With school scheduled to start over the next 10 days, talks
continued with 28 other locals across the state.
   Schools in the Great Falls district in Montana reopened Tuesday
with 540 substitute teachers for 12,500 students. Only 45 of 723
teachers showed up for work there last week. Salaries top the list
of contract issues.
   Laurel, Mont., teachers voted Saturday to accept a contract
giving them a 2.5 percent raise and returned to work Tuesday.
   In Michigan, teachers in the Jackson and Saginaw Township school
districts were on strike Tuesday.
   In Ohio, no negotiations were held in the Indian Creek and Warren
school districts. In Illinois, pay negotiations continued as a
strike in Quincy entered a second week.

   Two gunmen killed an army colonel's wife
outside a supermarket Tuesday, and Washington delivered five
helicopters to help the government break the drug lords' violent
grip on the country.
   President Bush, outlining a $7.9 billion war on narcotics, warned
Latin American drug traffickers Tuesday night that ``the rules have
changed.''
   The speech was broadcast live on Colombian television. Within a
half-hour, two bombs exploded at banks in the cocaine center of
Medellin, injuring seven people, the radio network Caracol reported.
   A police source said the government's 2{-week-old crackdown on
traffickers has virtually paralyzed the nation's cocaine-producing
laboratories.
   Bush proposed a four-fold increase in the amount of military and
law enforcement aid for Colombia, Bolivia and Peru, to $261.2
million in 1990. He called it the downpayment on a $2 billion,
five-year anti-drug program in the Andean region.
   Bush also said he and Colombian President Virgilio Barco hoped to
convene a ``drug summit'' to ``coordinate an inter-American strategy
against the cartels.''
   He singled out Barco for praise for his war on drug barons. ``We
have a responsibility not to leave our brave friends in Colombia to
fight alone,'' said Bush, who had already pledged $65 million in aid.
   In Bogota, the international editor of the newspaper El
Espectador, Camilo Cano, said Bush has ``a clear intention'' of
fighting drug traffickers.
   ``The most interesting thing would be to know what is going to be
the specific destination of the $2 billion he promised,'' Cano said
after the speech. Cano's newspaper office was damaged Saturday by a
bomb that wounded more than 80 people.
   Also Tuesday, the mayor of Bogota banned outdoor marches and
demonstrations for an indefinite period as a precautionary measure
in response to terrorist attacks by drug traffickers, Colombian
radio reported.
   The private national radio network RCN said Bogota Mayor Andres
Pastrana Arango ordered the ban ``to maintain normal public order.''
   In Medellin, where a nighttime curfew has been in effect since
last week, an armed gang forced everyone out of a restaurant, then
set it afire with gasoline, police said. It was not immediately
clear if the attack was related to the cocaine barons fighting the
government crackdown.
   The wave of attacks in Medellin continued Tuesday evening with
the bank bombings, a police spokesman said by telephone. He said he
had no details. Caracol said two girls, 7 and 11, were among seven
people suffering cuts from flying glass and other minor injuries.
   Police patrolled the streets of Medellin, 150 miles northwest of
Bogota, which was the site of four bomb attacks Monday night.
   Police gave no motive for the slaying of Angela de Guerrero, 32.
She was shot four times as she sat in her small sedan outside a
supermarket in Bogota's northern suburbs by two gunmen who fled in a
white car.
   Television footage showed a carton of eggs beside the slain woman
and hysterical shoppers near the scene.
   The victim was identified as the wife of Col. Carlos Guerrero, a
logistics planning officer for the joint military forces.
   Police have blamed previous instances of random violence on drug
traffickers retaliating for the government crackdown.
   The United States delivered five UH-1H ``Huey'' transport
helicopters, modified versions of the combat choppers that gained
prominence during the Vietnam war.
   They arrived in a huge C-5 transport plane at Bogota's El Dorado
airport, the last of the big-ticket items in President Bush's $65
million package to help the government fight its drug war.
   In recent days, the United States has sent Colombia five C-130
transport planes and eight A37 reconnaissance and attack jets. The
aid also includes machine guns, bulletproof vests, grenades, boats
and trucks.
   Drug lords have waged a campaign of bombings, assassinations and
threats, largely to intimidate the government into refusing to
extradite drug traffickers wanted in the United States. Colombia's
powerful cartels are believed to supply the United States with 80
percent of its cocaine.
   The drug war began in earnest Aug. 18, when an assassination
squad believed hired by drug czars killed leading presidential
candidate Luis Carlos Galan.
   Shortly after the helicopters were unloaded, an apparent bomb
threat caused airport security agents to remove passengers and
luggage from a jet of Colombia's Avianca Airlines about to take off
for Miami. Soldiers cleared the airport and brought in bomb-sniffing
dogs.
   A suspicious suitcase, shown on TV newscasts, turned out to be
full of rocks.
   The National Police said Tuesday that since the crackdown began,
cocaine production in Colombia has practically stopped and that
prices should go up as a result. Colombian authorities say they have
destroyed 252 cocaine labs this year.
   The Bogota newspaper El Tiempo, citing unidentified police
sources, on Tuesday forecast a cocaine shortage in the United
States. It also said 2.2 pounds of cocaine, which now costs $1,500
in Colombia and $10,000 wholesale in Miami, will go up in price
``considerably'' in coming months.
   Meanwhile, Eduardo Martinez Romero, indicted by a federal court
in Atlanta on trafficking charges, was believed to be facing the
last day Wednesday on which he could appeal his extradition to the
United States.
   Martinez, 35, an economist, was arrested Aug. 20 and is accused
in connection with the laundering of $1.2 billion in cocaine money.
The government, acting under emergency anti-drug measures, ordered
his extradition Aug. 30.
   Until now, Colombia has been unable or unwilling to extradite
drug traffickers. Fear pervades the Colombian legal system. Since
1980 more than 200 judges and court officials trying to prosecute
drug dealers here have been assassinated.

   Once they bought out a New York real estate
company. Once they pretended to be developers in Virginia. As the
folks at The Nature Conservancy have shown time and again, there's
more than one way to preserve wild lands. This is the last part of a
series, American Wilderness.

   While environmental groups have
battled government and development interests during the 25 years of
the Wilderness Act, a little-known private group has quietly put
aside nearly 4 million acres of ecologically important lands.
   In its 38 years, The Nature Conservancy has saved threatened
lands ranging from 343 square miles of rare New Mexican desert
grassland to a heron feeding ground on nine-tenths of an acre of
Connecticut marsh.
   And with a well-endowed war chest and a proven track record, the
Arlington, Va.-based, non-profit group now saves land at an average
of a thousand acres a day.
   The Conservancy's success is due in part to an organizational
credo. It will not fight developers in court nor seek a public forum
to save private land. It remains neutral in skirmishes involving
government, environmentalists and business interests, using a
checkbook and persuasion rather than lawyers and protests.
   ``We used to describe ourselves as the real estate arm of the
conservation movement,'' said Bill Weeks, the Conservancy's chief
operating officer. ``That role has been changing, but we still will
look to market-based solutions rather than regulatory solutions.''
   The Conservancy's proven techniques and changing role are evident
here in the Carrizo Plain, 180,000 acres of beautifully empty
grasslands 150 miles north of Los Angeles.
   Home to endangered species like the kit fox and blunt-nosed
lizard, the Carrizo was purchased after the Conservancy put together
such unlikely partners as state and federal agencies, the oil
industry, ranching interests and conservation groups.
   The Conservancy is involved in a new ambitious project to
re-introduce native grasses, elk and antelope, lost to farming and
cattle grazing.
   ``Grazing ended this April and the native grass is already coming
up,'' preserve manager Chuck Warner said, standing in an emerald
green island of native rye grass surrounded by the dusty brown,
lunar landscape.
   Nearly half the land acquired by The Nature Conservancy comes
through standard real estate deals. While much, including the
Carrizo, is turned over to state or federal stewardship, the
Conservancy owns and manages the world's largest private nature
preserve system with nearly 1,000 preserves.
   Other land targeted by the Conservancy is protected through
conservation easements and other agreements with landowners around
the country.
   ``They have done a superb job over the years,'' said Charles
Miller, a National Wildlife Federation spokesman. ``There is
sometimes a lot of controversy within the conservation community
over which way to proceed in an issue, but The Nature Conservancy
just goes in its own direction and does something that is a
fantastic service.''
   The organization began in 1946 when a special committee of the
Ecological Society of America split off to form the Ecologist's
Union, renamed The Nature Conservancy in 1951.
   In the early days, the group's main goal was to take undisturbed
lands out of circulation. Its first purchases were financed by
mortgages on the homes of members.
   Since then, the group has parlayed donations, grants and business
acumen into an $85 million fund and a national organization with
540,000 members staffed by more than 1,000 part-and full-time
organizers and naturalists.
   The Conservancy finds land to protect through its Natural
Heritage Program, a joint venture with state governments to
inventory and save the habitats of endangered plants and animals.
   ``We look for habitats or ecosystems that are particularly
threatened,'' said Steve McCormick, director of the California
Nature Conservancy. ``If you wait until a species is on the
endangered list, that usually means its habitat is gone.''
   Deals can be complicated. To save a Long Island osprey nesting
ground, the New York chapter had to purchase an entire real estate
company, complete with Manhattan brownstones and Florida warehouses.
   When the owner of a Virginia barrier island wanted his land
developed instead of conserved, the Conservancy purchased it through
a dummy development company.
   ``It created some public-relations problems with the people here
because they felt we were sneaky,'' said Barry Truitt, manager of
the Conservancy's Virginia Coast Preserve. ``We didn't use any
tactics that aren't used by developers, but I guess because we're
conservationists, they expect our standards to be higher.''
   Some land is donated. Bob Butler, a Kennebunk, Maine, furniture
store owner gave the Conservancy a 12-acre parcel along the
Kennebuck River.
   ``I didn't want it ever to be developed, but then someone offered
me a deal I could barely refuse,'' he said. ``I gave it up so I
wouldn't be tempted again.''
   Butler was so impressed with the Conservancy that he went on to
serve as a chairman its Maine board of trustees.
   The Conservancy offers other deals. It will take land in exchange
for low interest loans, other properties and lifetime annuities. It
will pay for conservation easements to keep land out of development.
   It also sponsors a landowner notification program to tell people
how to protect endangered species on their property.
   ``Landowners usually are surprised and delighted that they have
something rare on their land and they become advocates,'' said
McCormick.
   The Conservancy's non-confrontational stance has put it
increasingly in the role of mediator, as when local officials and
developers battled conservationists and government agencies over the
habitat of the Coachella fringe-toed lizard, a tiny reptile that
only survives in the special sands of the Coachella Valley in the
hot real estate market around Palm Springs.
   After months of negotiations, and $2 million in Conservancy seed
money, the parties agreed to a 13,000-acre preserve. Developers will
pay a $600 mitigation fee for each acre of lizard habitat that is
developed outside the preserve.
   Paul Selzer, a attorney for some developers, said the Conservancy
was able to show that setting the land aside served everyone's
interest.
   ``Another environmental group in the process could have made it
more difficult,'' he said.
   McCormick said the bitter controversy was eased when developers
saw their holdings would be enhanced by the preserve.
   ``Attitudes change,'' he said. ``The developers thought of
environmentalists as people with a weird interest in a strange
animal. Now they see it as a question of quality of life.''
   In addition to the role as mediator, the Conservancy has become
more involved in restoration. At its Blowing Rocks Preserve on
Florida's Jupiter Island, ``exotics,'' non-native trees like the
Australian pine and Brazilian Pepper, have been cut to halt their
encroachment on indigenous species and the fragile dune ecology.
   ``It's become clearer that not only species but whole biological
systems are threatened,'' Weeks said.
   The Conservancy is taking greater steps to protect those systems
through agreements that limit the use of adjacent lands. At the
Virginia Coast Preserve, the Conservancy has negotiated with
neighboring landowners to control development pressures on the
fringes of the preserve.
   ``We once thought we were going to be establishing nature
preserves that would exist apart from society,'' said Weeks. ``Now
we've come to feel the integration of these nature preserves with
the fabric of the society around them is critical.''

   An independent counsel decided not to prosecute
one of President Bush's aides, who was investigated for a $5,000
loan from a Baltimore brokerage company that required no repayment,
according to a report published Wednesday.
   Former U.S. Attorney Dan K. Webb of Chicago, who served as the
independent counsel in the case, determined there was no evidence to
support prosecuting James W. Cicconi under the Ethics in Government
Act, The Washington Post reported.
   Cicconi is in charge of the White House appointment office.
   Cicconi, reached at home Tuesday night, said he had no comment on
the report.
   Cicconi received the loan in 1984 from First American Mortgage
Co. to cover moving expenses to Austin, Texas, where he planned to
enter private law practice after leaving the Reagan White House.
   Michael Clott, chairman of First American, told invstigators that
the loan was to be a ``sham loan'' and probably would not be repaid.
Clott is serving a 12{ year prison term for fraud and racketeering.
   Cicconi repaid the loan with interest, according to unnamed
sources cited by the Post.

   For sale: 29,000 home lots, two 18-hole
golf courses, a 1,700-seat auditorium, a building supply store, a
121-room hotel with restaurant, and a weekly newspaper.
   Federal bank regulators are looking for a buyer for the
development company that owns more than 10 percent of this one-light
town's land and nearly all of the major recreation and public
facilities.
   Land Resources Corp., which came under federal control in May, is
among the more curious jetsam of the nation's savings and loan
crisis, which has coughed up other odd thrift holdings from llamas
to a desert bordello.
   Land Resources was acquired in 1984 by Security Savings and Loan
of Scottsdale, Ariz. When the thrift was declared insolvent this
year, regulators seized its assets.
   ``It's strange for sure,'' said William Crocker, appointed by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to oversee Security Savings, which
had about $1 billion in assets. ``Many S&amp;Ls had real estate, but to
own part of a town is really unusual.''
   Crocker said 60 to 80 information packets were being sent to
potential bidders around the world and a deal should be completed
before Christmas. He said only that the property is valued ``in the
eight figures.''
   Meanwhile, residents of this 25-year-old community are looking
for assurances that life will continue as always amid the
sprinkler-fed lawns and bicycles leaning unlocked against evenly
spaced palms on the edge of the Everglades.
   ``The one thing I keep repeating is: `Don't worry. Nothing is
going to change.' But as soon as they hear the federal government is
involved they panic,'' said Carl Strunk, president of Land Resources
Corp.
   Although Land Resources has sold many of its former holdings,
including two shopping centers and a bowling alley, it remains the
largest employer of the town's 25,000 residents.
   Strunk predicts Land Resources will be purchased by an
development company interested in maintaining operations. ``I'm
convinced the whole of this company is worth more than the sum of
its parts,'' he said.
   Lehigh Acres was ranch land before the postwar development boom.
Land Resources acquired the property in 1968.
   Original plans were for a retirement haven for Northerners. In
one section targeted for retired telephone employees, streets bear
names such as Switchboard and Long Lines.
   Other sections are typical small-town America: churches, banks, a
small hospital, two Chinese restaurants and an industrial park.
   Strunk said Lehigh Acres has the potential for about 400,000
residents.
   Lehigh Acres is growing by about 1,000 residents annually and
Land Resources brings families down for subsidized vacations to tour
the community and time-share units.
   Less than half the residents are retirees, with the others mostly
commuting to Fort Myers, 12 miles away, said Strunk. ``We're just
like any small town anywhere,'' he said. ``It just happens that a
failed S&amp;L owned part of it.''
   But word of the federal takeover is a tender subject.
   In July, Strunk wrote a front-page article in the company-owned
Lehigh Times newspaper to allay concern about the sale. Strunk also
has discouraged the nearly 500 Land Resources employees from
discussing the sale with reporters.
   ``This place is Mr. and Mrs. Middle America. It's Dayton, Ohio,
and Detroit, Mich. They are going to spend a lot of time worrying
about this if people keep sounding alarmed,'' said Strunk. ``I keep
saying it's not a big deal.''
   At the K mart lunch counter, residents seemed more concerned with
gossip than speculation on the fate of Land Resources.
   ``This town will survive,'' said Joseph Ferrante, a retired New
York police officer. ``At worst, maybe a new owner over there will
be good. It could be a change for the better.''

   More than 6,000 Jews left the Soviet Union last
month, the highest monthly figure in at least a decade, a
resettlement agency says.
   The 6,008 arrivals at a Vienna transit center were the biggest
outflow since the Intergovernmental Committee on Migration began
keeping monthly figures in 1979, ICM spokeswoman Regina Boucault
said Monday.
   The latest exodus, which was more than three times the August
1988 rate, brought the 1989 total to 30,141.
   Only 127 of the Jews traveling through Vienna went on directly to
Israel in August, Boucault said. Most are going to the United States.
   The committee's latest monthly figures were lower than those
announced Friday in Washington by the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry. The U.S. group said 6,756 Soviet Jews emigrated last month
and 793 went to Israel.
   Boucault said the total figure apparently reflects the number of
Soviet Jews arriving in the United States, which could include
migrants who were counted when they arrived in Western Europe in
previous months.
   Those reported as settling in Israel may include Jews who went
there via Bucharest rather than Vienna and are not monitored by the
Intergovernmental Committee on Migration, she said.
   Some 300,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated since the resettlement
program began in 1971. The largest official exodus, 51,328, was
recorded in 1979, before the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan
chilled East-West relations.

   World War II hasn't quite ended for thousands of
Koreans who were brought by the Japanese to work the coal mines of
the Pacific island of Sakhalin more than 40 years ago.
   Refused exit by their new Soviet overlords after the war, the
Koreans have been forced to live in exile.
   But their homecoming may finally be near with warming relations
between the Soviet Union and capitalist South Korea.
   In the last month, the Soviets have begun talks with South Korea
through the Red Cross and other channels to solve the long-festering
problem.
   For many, it could be too late. Of the 43,000 Koreans in Sakhalin
at the end of the war, only 4,000 to 5,000 are thought to be alive.
   Om Chol-young is one of them.
   Conscripted by Japan in 1943 to work as a coal miner while
Japan's own workers were fighting the war, Om and his wife were
taken to the Japanese-controlled southern half of Sakhalin.
   When the war ended, Om put his wife and infant son on a ship to
Korea, thinking he soon would follow.
   But in August 1945, the Soviets extended their control to all of
the North Pacific island, and Om could not leave.
   Although Korea also had been wrested from Japanese colonial
control, it had been divided between the Communist North and the
South.
   The Soviets terminated contact between Sakhalin and the South, in
effect extending the exile of Om and others like him with families
in the South.
   Exiles with families in North Korea were apparently allowed to
return, but neither the Soviet Union nor North Korea has confirmed
it.
   During his exile, Om later married another Korean woman in
Sakhalin and had two children.
   Nevertheless, he persisted in his goal of returning to his first
wife and child. In June, he received permission to resettle in Korea.
   Returning to Korea ``was the only thing I asked from life,'' Om
said in a recent interview in Tokyo. ``Being in the Soviet Union was
really hard. It's not that I didn't like it there, but my wife and
child were in Korea.''
   Now, 74-year-old Om is back in South Korea, living with both his
families in the southern port of Pusan.
   Efforts to repatriate the Koreans have long been thwarted by
Japanese indifference and tension between the Soviet Union and
rigidly anti-communist South Korea.
   But the recent warming of relations between Seoul and Moscow,
reflecting East-West detente and Soviet recognition of South Korea's
growing economic power, has given hope to Sakhalin exiles.
   Before 1986, only a handful were allowed to meet with their
families each year. The number has increased dramatically.
   This year, 500 to 600 may ultimately be reunited with loved ones,
says Kenichi Takagi, a Tokyo lawyer and leader of a volunteer group
that has sponsored most of the visits.
   The reunions, which previously were held in Japan, can now take
place in Korea. Moreover, more than 10 Koreans, including Om, have
received permission to move back to their homeland permanently.
   Under a Soviet-South Korean agreement reached in the talks, a
chartered South Korean plane may be allowed to take several hundred
Koreans from Sakhalin before the end of the year, sources from South
Korea's governing party said recently.
   Japan has also begun to take more interest in the fate of the
exiles.
   Two years ago, 170 members of the Japanese parliament formed a
non-partisan group to promote a quick resolution of the issue. At
the group's urging, the government this year set aside $405,000
toward repatriation efforts.
   Japanese leaders also have raised the issue in talks with the
Soviets.
   Takagi maintains Japan should do more.
   ``Japan must take care of all the costs for the families to
reunite. It also must pay compensation for the 45 years that these
people lost,'' he said.
   ``Postwar Germans have paid reparations to the Jews and to
Israel. They have conquered their past. But Japan's debt to the
Korean people still remains. Repaying it is the responsibility of
the Japanese people.''

   When drug traffickers are going to kill a
Colombian judge, they send the target a copy of his own obituary, a
funeral wreath or a copy of what is known as ``the book of the
dead.''
   The book, with a prayer inside, is sold in gift shops to
relatives who have recently lost a loved one.
   When a judge receives it, or a wreath or an obituary, it is
considered a kiss of death, two Colombia jurists recently told The
Associated Press.
   ``This year, we have been burying one judge every 15 days,''
judge Antonio Suarez said. He said 220 judges and court employes
have been killed since 1980.
   Despite the threats, Suarez and judge Helmut Romero say they are
going to stick with their jobs because they are proud of their
professions.
   ``We judges are fundamental pillars for constitutional law,''
Suarez said.
   An estimated 1,600 of Colombia's 4,600 judges have received
threats, mostly from drug traffickers who have powerful influence in
this country, which supplies the United States with most of its
cocaine.
   ``We are frightened. Nobody can deny it. But we have learned to
live with it,'' Romero said.
   Like judges in other underdeveloped nations, Colombian jurists
receive low pay and work in poor conditions. The average salary is
$350 a month, and many store court records in bathrooms and kitchens
because there is not enough space elsewhere.
   In August, the nation's judges went on strike, but they were not
seeking better pay or working conditions. They wanted better
protection.
   The judges ended the strike when war broke out between government
security forces and drug traffickers following the Aug. 18
assassination of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a leading presidential
candidate.
   President Virgilio Barco's government said it would resume
extraditing Colombians to the United States. The traffickers
threatened to kill 10 judges for each Colombian extradited.
   The extraditions have not begun. The Supreme Court is expected to
rule this month on whether to allow them.
   More than 500 estates and hundreds of cars, planes and 33 yachts
believed to belong to drug traffickers have been confiscated in the
past two weeks.
   Suarez and Romero believe the crackdown has created more dangers
for judges, since the judges must decide if properties remain
confiscated and rule on the legality of the government measures.
   The latest judge to fall victim to drug traffickers was Carlos
Ernesto Valencia. He was investigating the slaying in 1987 of Jaime
Pardo Leal, a member of a federal appeals court in Bogota, a former
president of the Colombian Justice Officials Association and former
presidential candidate for the leftist Patriotic Union party.
   Pardo Leal apparently was murdered by a drug traffickers' death
squad.
   Because Valencia was handling the case, he was threatened
frequently. He moved often to elude his persecutors.
   He was assassinated Aug. 17, at the onset of the bloody weekend
that led to the current war with drug traffickers.
   Looking for help from the United States to protect Colombian
judges, Justice Minister Monica de Greiff rushed to Washington in
late August. Her $19 million request would cover bulletproof vests,
guards and pistol training for the judges.
   According to press reports, her trip to Washington was actually
prompted by an anonymous phone caller who told her: ``You will be
next.''
   Judges Suarez and Romero don't believe personal protection alone
will solve the problem.
   They said real solutions should come from radical changes in
Colombian society.
   For judges, they say, living under threats means a disruption of
family life.
   Judges are known to change their routine, switching routes to the
office, shopping in different supermarkets and not leaving home or
returning at the same time.
   Changing routes to the office isn't easy because most judges go
to work on buses. A salary of $350 a month is not enough to afford a
car.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The whoosh and boom of exploding
rockets terrorizes Kabul at all hours of the day and night, creating
a climate of fear not known before in the 11-year-old Afghan civil
war.
   Periods of intense rocketing occurred in the past, especially
last fall, but longtime observers say the barrage that began in June
has been more deadly.
   Between June 25 and Aug. 26, United Nations sources said 577
rockets pounded Kabul, killing 366 people and injuring 999. Nearly
all were civilians, struck at random in homes or offices, at bus
stops, bazaars, movie houses.
   ``We are very, very afraid that rockets will kill all the
people,'' said Mohammad Aqbar, who gave up teaching to earn more
money selling potatoes and onions in the bazaar. ``When we hear the
rockets, we try to hide with our families, but sometimes there is no
place to go.''
   U.N. sources say many Kabul residents in recent weeks have
migrated north, where fewer rockets and cheaper and more plentiful
food await them.
   Most of the rockets hitting Kabul have been Egyptian or
Chinese-made SAKR-20s or SAKR-30s, with a range of about 12{ or 20
miles, though U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting to overthrow the
Soviet-backed government of President Najib say they have SAKR's
with a range up to 38 miles.
   In mid-August, Afghanistan accused the United States and Pakistan
of supplying the guerrillas with new, more lethal long-distance
rockets armed with cluster-bomb warheads.
   The rebels deny firing them, Pakistan calls the allegations
unfounded and the United States refuses to comment.
   The new rockets remain unidentified. Reporters were first taken
to see two rockets bearing the numbers E320-MII@1344 and
E320-MII@138 and no other markings except a tag saying in Arabic
and English, ``Before loading take out safety plug.'' Days later,
they were taken to see the contents of the warhead _98 bombs that
stack into each other.
   Late last month, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil wrote U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar saying these long-range
missiles scattered cluster bombs with delayed time fuses and
anti-personnel mines which were ``aimed at mass murder and wreaking
havoc and terror in the cities.''
   The first cluster rocket hit Kabul Aug. 15, killing five
civilians and wounding 23 in the former Soviet-occupied Mikrorayan
housing complex near Kabul Airport, now home to many government
workers, the government said. A second struck a dozen children
playing in the Cala-i-Shada district Aug. 19, killing seven and
wounding five.
   ``They are shaped like light-bulb sockets,'' said Asmatullah, an
18-year-old student who lives in the Mikrorayan complex. ``One small
boy took one home and it exploded. He lost his arm.''
   Military experts say the government can defend this mile-high
capital ringed by parched, treeless hills that are a great strategic
advantage. Experts say a conventional guerrilla assault would be
suicidal, given the government's powerful air and land defenses.
   While insignificant in military terms, the rocketing has been a
major psychological weapon.
   Many Kabul residents blame the rocketing on the guerrillas, who
call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic holy warriors, and their
American backers.
   ``Every time there's a rocket, my cook watches and says, `That's
America','' said one foreign relief worker, speaking anonymously.
   ``The American government shouldn't help the mujahedeen with
these rockets. Our people don't want war,'' said Noor Karga, a
cleaner at Avecinna Chest Hospital. He had just watched 22 victims
of rocket attacks being brought in and eight die.
   But more and more, Kabulis blame the government and their Soviet
suppliers as well.
   ``Please tell the Russians and the Americans, don't help with
such sort of weapons,'' said Mohammad Hussein, 32, who was
hospitalized with shrapnel wounds from a rocket attack.
   ``Both sides buy rockets and we hate both of them, the Soviet
Union and the United States,'' said Sayed Salahuddin, an 18-year-old
student, as he walked through the rubble of a neighbor's house that
took a direct hit.
   Before Soviet troops withdrew on Feb. 15, Soviet and Afghan
forces would retaliate immediately against rocket attacks on Kabul
with heavy artillery fire and helicopter gunships hitting suspected
rocket-launching positions. Now, very little counteraction by the
Afghan air force is seen, military observers said.
   The government announced in mid-August it was extending the
security belt around Kabul from 30 kilometers (19 miles) to between
40 and 60 kilometers (25 and 38 miles) to prevent long-range rockets
from hitting the city.
   Abdul Kabir of Younis Khalis' fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islami
guerrilla group told The Associated Press in Pakistan that
Soviet-supplied government rockets, not rebel ones, were hitting
civilian targets in Kabul.
   ``We know that the Kabul government is firing from their own
positions to Kabul city for propaganda purposes,'' to turn civilians
against the guerrillas, he said. ``The enemy (government) is hitting
the hospitals, and bazaars and even the mosques. After this they
show it on TV and blame the mujahedeen.''
   The government strongly denied firing any rockets at Kabul.

   South Koreans are living longer and
having fewer children than ever before and by the year 2020 the
country's population growth will be zero, officials said today.
   The average life expectancy for a South Korean child born this
year is 70.1 years, the Korea Institute for Population and Health
said in a report. Women can expect to live 73.3 years and men 66.9
years.
   Life expectancy for American newborns is about 75 years.
   The institute estimated that population will increase 0.97
percent in 1989, with growth slowing to zero in the year 2020 at a
peak of 52 million people. South Korea now has a population of 42
million.
   The average Korean woman now is expected to give birth to 1.6
children, compared with six children in 1960.
   The report said that 77 percent of married women between the ages
of 15 and 44 use some form of birth control, up from 20 percent in
1966.

   Summer's unofficial end brought reports
of snow by two radio stations and some local officials who couldn't
resist the prank.
   Dennis Ryan, managing partner of WIRD-AM and WLPW-FM, said the
sister stations reported Monday morning that temperatures dropped 80
degrees between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. and that 12 inches of snow had
fallen.
   The winter weather on Labor Day also froze an early morning
waterskiier on Lake Placid and passengers on a tour boat had to walk
to shore _ on the ice, the stations reported.
   Jerry Blair, schools superintendent, announced during a live
interview that schools would be closed. Mayor Robert Peacock
reassured folks municipal services were holding up.
   Ryan said the station got the idea for the hoax during a bad
snowstorm last winter and worked for two weeks with local officials
to set it up.
   Monday's high was 72 degrees and skies were sunny.

   If the neighbor's lawnmower is sitting in
your garage because you haven't gotten around to returning it, the
Procrastinators Club of America wants to honor you.
   Today is ``National Be Late for Something Day,'' said Les Waas,
spokesman for the group, and late returners will be honored.
   ``We usually honor somebody, this year we're honoring all
`procrastineighbors' _ the people who borrow the lawnmower and
ladder and tools and those sort of things,'' Waas said Monday.
   ``They procrastinate returning them, thereby preventing us from
doing our chores and giving us time to take naps and have some fun
and enjoy doing other things.''
   Waas said the neighbors have been granted amnesty. ``They don't
have to get them back tomorrow, either,'' he said.
   He said the procrastinators have been celebrating ``Be Late for
Something Day'' for 15 years. About 6,800 people have joined the
group.
   ``We have a half a million members who haven't gotten around to
joining yet,'' he said.

instead: a shot of bourbon and a soda.
   At a celebration for her upcoming 104th birthday, Mrs. Brown said

   ``He told me it couldn't hurt,'' Mrs. Brown said Saturday as
about 30 friends and relatives gathered at her home. ``If it's 4

   ``I eat what I want when I want, and I've never been on a diet,''
she added.
   Mrs. Brown said she relishes her independence. She has lived
alone since her husband, Leroy, died in 1971. Although she suffers
from cataracts and depends upon hearing aids, she said a nursing
home is out of the question.
   ``I can still take care of myself,'' she said. ``I feel like I do

   Posses are largely a thing of the past in
west Texas, but the Ranger police chief and a justice of the peace
rounded up about 50 men on Labor Day weekend to help corral an
unusual escapee.
   It took a while, but posse members finally surrounded and lassoed
their prey _ a 4-foot-long caiman.
   The alligator-like reptile had broken out of a fenced-in pond and
was spotted Sunday night crawling toward a football field in the
town of about 3,400.
   Justice of the Peace Alford Bush not only led the caiman's
capture, but persuaded his wife, Jackie, to let him keep it
overnight until its owner showed up.
   ``Alford used my extension cord to corral the critter,'' Mrs.
Bush said.
   Ranger Junior College biology professor Jerry Glidewell claimed
the caiman on Monday. He usually keeps the reptile in an aquarium in
his classroom but was keeping it at his home for treatment of a skin
disorder.

   Tony award-winning actor Cleavon Little
has come to the Alabama Shakespeare Festival for preview
performances of a one-man play in which he portrays an elderly
sharecropper.
   Little, whose grandfather was a sharecropper, opens Wednesday in
``All God's Dangers,'' which is scheduled to run at the 17-year-old
festival through Oct. 1, and then move to New York.
   The play tells the story of Ned Cobb, who was born in 1885 in
Tallassee, 40 miles northeast of Montgomery, and transcended his
humble beginnings as a son of a former slave. Theodore Rosengarten,
who co-wrote the play with co-producers Michael Hadley and Hadley's
sister Jennifer, profiled Cobb under the pseudonym Nate Shaw in a
book on which the play is based.
   Little said the role is the greatest challenge of his career.
   ``I play an 85-year-old man, but I tell a number of different
stories and I become a number of different characters. I don't
change,'' said 50-year-old actor.
   ``(Shaw) becomes young at times, so the illusion I have to create
makes you want to forget he's old.''
   Little is probably best known for his role as the sheriff in the
Mel Brooks comedy ``Blazing Saddles.'' He won a Tony award for his
role as a rousing minister in ``Purlie'' and was nominated for a
Tony for his performance in ``I'm Not Rappaport.''

   Berke Breathed, who ended his ``Bloom
County'' comic strip last month, is enjoying his escape from daily
cartooning, which he calls ``a sponge on your imagination.''
   Breathed, who has a home in Evergreen, has a new, weekly comic
strip called ``Outland.'' In it, he said, ``I'm working in the
fantasy land of a little girl whose real life is less than real
easy. ... As `Outland' progresses, people will notice that the
landscape changes.''
   He said that may include backdrops that resemble Utah and
northern Arizona, locales that have been ``inspirations to me
artistically.''
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Bloom County,'' which began in 1980
and featured such characters as Opus the penguin and Bill the Cat,
appeared in 543 daily newspapers. Breathed would draw a month's
worth of strips in just a few days, working around the clock.
   ``I realized I was aging much too fast,'' he said. ``I would be
remiss if I didn't admit that a tremendous load has been lifted off
my creative shoulders.''
   Now the cartoonist says he will have time to write a column for
``Boating'' magazine spoofing the hobby and to devote more time to
animal-rights organizations.

at the third Tom Osborne Golf Classic.
   Professional golfer Bruce Crampton won the charity tournament
Monday as he birdied six of the last nine holes to finish with a

   About 600 people watched the tournament.
   Devine is a member of the White House Council for a Drug-Free

   Nearly 15 years after fleeing the
crumbling Republic of South Vietnam, Nguyen Cao Ky, the former
dashing fighter pilot and premier, sees a role for himself in
postwar Vietnam's future.
   A bankruptcy five years ago shut down his Orange County liquor
business and he shouldered the burden of never-substantiated rumors
that he was kingpin of a Vietnamese organized crime clan.
   With those troubles behind him, he still commands admiration from
much of the expatriate Vietnamese community, many of whom approach
him at restaurants in Orange County's ``Little Saigon'' to swap war
stories or present their children to him.
   He said he returned recently from a trip to Asia, saying he is
serving as a consultant to governments and industry. He would not be
more specific.
   ``I don't want to be the first Vietnamese city councilman,'' he
said in an interview published Monday in the Orange County Register.
``I am a general, not a social worker.''
   Ky, who once tried to whip up support for military resistance to
North Vietnam, says that struggle is over. Instead, the United
States should use its economic clout to pressure the communists
toward reforms of the type going on in Poland, he said.
   To that end, he believes he might still have a role as loyal
opposition leader in his homeland. ``I am Asian. I believe in
destiny,'' he said.

attending an International Olympic Committee meeting in Puerto Rico
when Buckingham Palace announced Thursday that she was separated
from her husband, Mark Phillips, after 15 years of marriage.
   The palace said no divorce is planned but Anne will live at the
family home, Gatcombe Park, and Phillips, 40, will move to another
house in Gloucestershire.

<TEXT>
   When a New York-based magazine for apartment
builders wrote in July 1988 of influence-peddling in the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, agency officials braced themselves
for a scandal.
   But the scandal didn't materialize until the following April when
HUD's inspector general reported that developers and consultants
were reaping millions of dollars and that there was a ``widespread
perception'' of favoritism and abuse in the Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation Program.
   The allegations of fraud and influence-peddling at HUD are
front-page news now. Samuel Pierce Jr., housing secretary during all
eight years of President Reagan's term, will be the lead witness
when a House subcommittee resumes its HUD hearings on Sept. 15.
   A Senate subcommittee also will resume hearings this fall, but no
date has been set. Meanwhile, the congressional tax-writing
committees are working on ways to tighten the low-income housing tax
credit that attracted many developers to HUD projects.
   The moderate rehabilitation program began in 1979 as a lever to
induce landlords to make modest improvements to bring low-income
housing up to standards.
   But HUD inspector general Paul Adams' April 26 report said there
was little to indicate help was going to those who needed it most,
and that rents on HUD-financed rehabilitation projects were mostly
at the maximum allowable.
   Among the reports about HUD:
   _Adams testified last month that at least $5.7 million was paid
to 20 well-connected consultants who helped their employers win big
HUD contracts on housing for the poor. The consultants included
former officials of the agency and politically influential
Republicans.
   _Two HUD audits said rent subsidies were improperly inflated by
$6 million for a housing project in Tulsa, Okla., owned by a
partnership that includes four former HUD officials. There were
similar reports elsewhere.
   _Government records showed that HUD issued a waiver of
regulations that allowed developers represented by Pierce's former
law firm to keep lucrative HUD subsidies.
   _Thomas T. Demery, assistant secretary of housing in the Reagan
administration, attended fund-raisers at which developers seeking
HUD projects contributed to Demery's pet charity, FOOD for Africa.
The Justice Department said it found no evidence Demery had
criminally misused his office.
   _Routing slips showed that Deborah Gore Dean, former executive
secretary to Pierce, routinely authorized use of a signature machine
to stamp projects with Pierce's approval.
   There were danger signals along the way in the housing
rehabilitation program, but they went largely unnoticed.
   In his semiannual report for the period ending Sept. 30, 1985,
Adams said audits by his office had confirmed ``serious problems''
in the program, showing that rents for 78 percent of the units
examined were excessive.
   In January 1986, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the
House Government Operations subcommittee on housing, alerted by
reports of irregularities in Buffalo, asked Adams to review the way
HUD distributed funds.
   Pressed on the question at a subcommittee hearing the next month,
Adams replied in writing that he had found that headquarters
officials of HUD ``did not document their discretionary allocation
decisions.''
   The Democrat-controlled House Banking Committee held nine
oversight hearings on HUD programs during the first six years of the
Reagan administration, while the Republican-controlled Senate
Banking Committee held four. Yet the hearings failed to uncover the
scope of the problem.
   Multi-Housing News, a New York-based magazine for apartment,
townhouse and condominium builders, got wind of what was going on
and published an eight-page article in July 1988 headed,
``Influence-Peddling Probed in Sec. 8 Mod Rehab.'' It named many of
the same names that have surfaced since Adams' April 26 report.
   Adams and Robert E. Nipp, director of press relations for HUD,
braced themselves for a major news organization to pick up the
story. None did.
   ``Nobody felt there was a Pulitzer Prize lurking at HUD,'' said
Bill Monroe, editor of the Washington Journalism Review.
   Against this background, there is a series of stories from the
Boston Herald-American, which examined $175,000 in presidential
campaign contributions by Massachusetts developers and found that
all of the contributors had received approval from HUD for Section 8
projects. The newspaper also reported that rents in such projects
were excessive and the needs of poor families were not being met.
   The series appeared June 22-25, 1980. The president whose
campaign received the contributions was Jimmy Carter.

<HEAD>US Cracking Down on Taverns, Convenience Stores _ And an Elks Lodge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is cracking down on fraternal
groups, taverns, convenience store owners and other small businesses
that are behind _ one by 50 years _ on paying a federal tax on
liquor retailers.
   The tax was increased by 463 percent last year, from $54 to $250
for each establishment. Accompanying the increase was a vigorous
enforcement effort by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   The Elks Lodge 109 in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., was stunned to get a
bill 10 months ago for $9,776.98 from ATF representing unpaid taxes
and penalties back to 1940, when the lodge got its liquor license.
   The lodge, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary, said it
had never heard of the tax.
   ``Our attitude, quite frankly, was that if you had notified us,
we would have been more than happy to pay,'' said lodge attorney
Peter Paul Olszewski. ``How could you possibly have a tax that goes
back `ad infinitum' without a statute of limitations?''
   Olszewski said the Elks recently settled with ATF for less than
one-tenth the amount of the original demand.
   About 600,000 beer, wine and distilled spirits dealers that sell
directly to the public must pay the ``special occupational tax.''
   The tax has been around for 123 years, but the government admits
that a lot of retailers have never heard of it. Responsibility for
collections shifted to ATF in 1986 from the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``Sixty percent of the retailers have known about it and paid
it,'' said ATF spokesman Jack Killorin.
   Killorin said it was uncertain how many deadbeats there are. He
said the government expects to collect between $25 million and $30
million from the program this year in current and back taxes and
penalties.
   ``The difficulty arises in identifying and notifying those
parties for whom retail liquor sales is an ancillary or secondary
part of their operation _ a lodge or country club, a bait or tackle
shop operator,'' Killorin said.
   Since the crackdown began, ATF has been exchanging taxpayer
information with the states, with the idea of making retailers aware
of their obligations before their liability mounts.
   ``We knew that (when) it went to $250, we had to pull out all the
stops because the accumulation was going to be dramatic,'' Killorin
said.
   ``We know by the calls we're getting that the tax is upsetting
people. It is not our desire to move in and foreclose and put
someone out of business. But it's very important that people get in
touch with ATF so they can work something out _ maybe a payment plan
_ and get them up to speed,'' he said.
   Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said the crackdown was having a
dramatic unfair impact.
   ``Across Pennsylvania, and indeed the nation, fraternal lodges,
non-profit organizations and small businesses are being blind-sided
with fines and bills for a tax they never knew existed,'' Kanjorski
said.
   He has been seeking colleagues' support for a bill permitting ATF
to go only as far back as 1985 to collect the tax.
   Backing Kanjorski's bill is the National Licensed Beverage
Association, which represents up to 300,000 bars and taverns and is
focusing its lobbying efforts more on last year's tax increase than
on the enforcement crackdown.
   Association lobbyist John Chwat said most members pay the tax,
but believe the increase was based on a false assumption in Congress
``that tavern owners can afford it.''
   Terry Richman of the National Association of Convenience Stores
said she was uncertain how many of the group's members knew about
the tax. ``It's certainly more than half, but I don't know how much
more,'' she said.
   The problem, Richman said, is that ATF ``is not really a revenue
agent and they haven't done a lot of outreach.'' Her group
represents about 60,000 stores.

   President Bush's war on illegal drugs, which he
launches tonight with a speech to the nation, will pit him against
the powerful forces of history and nature. Both have caused his
predecessors' efforts to fizzle in failure.
   But the president's aides say that, somehow, this time will be
different.
   Nevertheless, psychopharmacologist Ronald K. Siegel at the
University of California at Los Angeles says wars against drugs are
hopeless and misguided because the desire for mind-altering
substances is healthy and natural, and animals do it as well as
people.
   While animals in the wild seek out plants containing psychoactive
chemicals and go to great lengths to continue getting them, some
animals in his laboratory studies, including cats, craved morphine,
Siegel writes in a new book, ``Intoxication.''
   ``When cats were used as subjects it was often necessary for the
handlers to use trickery and force to avoid being bitten or
scratched during the initial injections,'' Siegel writes.
``Resistance vanished after a few injections and the cats would run
to the experimenter, jump on his lap, and even lick his hand while
waiting for the morphine.''
   However, William J. Bennett, the director of national drug
control policy, says ``real progress'' is already being made in the
battle to get casual users of drugs to stop doing so, as reflected
by the 1988 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.
   The survey found a 37 percent decrease from a 1985 survey in the
number of people who said they had used marijuana, cocaine or other
illicit drugs in the previous month. The survey also indicated that
the number of people who said they had used an illegal drug in the
previous year fell by 25 percent over the three years.
   ``People who have been saying, `All is lost, we can't win, let's
legalize,' have never been more wrong,'' said Bennett, who developed
the national drug strategy for Bush.
   Since the early years of this century, the United States has
struggled to control the distribution and use of mind-altering drugs.
   Cocaine and heroin were legal and widely available until 1914,
when they were outlawed by the Harrison Narcotic Act. Just eight
years before, concern over widespread use of the substances had
inspired the Pure Food and Drug Act that required patent medicines
to list their ingredients, said Eric Sterling, president of The
Criminal Justice Policy Foundation.
   Marijuana was outlawed in 1937, just four years after alcohol
came back on the market with the end of Prohibition.
   Hysteria over heroin broke out again in the 1950s, and two
versions of the Boggs Act, passed in 1952 and 1954, called for
severe prison sentences for drug traffickers.
   In 1963, President John F. Kennedy convened a White House
Conference on Drug Abuse.
   Little more than a half-decade later, President Richard Nixon
declared war on drugs, launching an aggressive law enforcement
attack on the widespread use of illegal drugs during the heady,
marijuana smoke-filled days of anti-Vietnam War protests when
``turn-on, tune-in and drop-out'' were the watchwords, at least
temporarily, for a generation.
   In the last two decades, millions have been arrested on drug
charges, billions of dollars worth of illegal drugs have been
seized, rock 'n' roll stars and honored athletes have died of
overdoses, and some inner cities whose problems used to be poverty,
unemployment, discrimination and alcohol and heroin abuse have added
raging and deadly drug-related gunfights to the list.
   Billions have been spent on law enforcement, less for treatment
and prevention.
   From fiscal year 1981 through 1989, the federal government spent
$16.5 billion for law enforcement, $2.4 billion for drug abuse
prevention and $2.4 billion for treatment for a total expenditure of
$21.3 billion, according to the General Accounting Office, the
investigative branch of Congress, which used figures from the Office
of Management and Budget.
   Most of that was spent in fiscal years 1986 through 1989, which
accounted for $13.6 billion _ $10.4 billion for law enforcement,
$1.7 billion for prevention and $1.5 billion for treatment _ the GAO
found.
   Meanwhile, cocaine is pouring over the nation's borders, domestic
growers produce 25 percent of the nation's marijuana supply, and the
heroin problem is growing. The price of the three drugs is going
down and the purity is going up.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter is a
breezy, friendly sort. Informality is his style, and that includes
letters to Tom, Dick and Connie on Capitol Hill.
   Just so letter writers in the Agriculture Department's vast
bureaucracy get it straight, they have been issued a manual called,
``Secretary Yeutter's First-Name List for Priority Correspondence.''
   Specifically, it's for letters written in USDA's agencies that
are forwarded to Yeutter for his signature.
   For example, a congressman might complain about USDA meat
inspection, so the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service
is asked to respond with a letter for Yeutter to sign.
   The list is broken down in alphabetical order into House and
Senate segments. There are others for state governors, state
commissioners of agriculture, and cabinet members.
   Each line bears the person's title _ ``Honorable'' for both the
House and Senate _ first name, middle initial, last name, subtitle
such as Jr. or II or III, position such as congressman or senator,
and the diminutives of first names, or nicknames if used. There is
nothing to show the person's political party or state.
   Not every entry has a middle initial, subtitle or diminutive,
such as Bob for Robert or Don for Donald. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., for example, may be Ted to buddies, but he's Edward in
Yeutter's book.
   About half the members of the House and three-fourths of the
Senate are cited for first-name treatment under the heading for
diminutives or nicknames.
   Sen. Charles S. Robb, D-Va., popularly called Chuck by friends
and colleagues, is Charles, while Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa,
is Chuck.
   Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., is shown as Jay. Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., is listed as Pat, and Sen. Ernest
F. Hollings, D-S.C., is Fritz.
   Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., rates Bob in Yeutter's list; Sen.
Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo., is Kit; and Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato,
R-N.Y., is Al.
   In the House, other examples of Yeutter's first-name list include
Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., as Tom, while Rep. Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., rates a double listing _ as Tom and as Mr. Speaker.
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., is Dick; Rep. Robert H. Michel,
R-Ill., is Bob; Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., is Sonny; Rep.
Charles Pashayan Jr., R-Calif., is Chip; and Rep. Constance A.
Morella, R-Md., is Connie.
   In the cabinet, Secretary of State James A. Baker III is Jim;
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is Nick, and Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney is Dick. But Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, whose
husband rated a Bob, is Elizabeth, not Liddy.
   The first-name list, which is dated Aug. 1, follows a memo
circulated back in March to all undersecretaries, assistant
secretaries and agency heads, informing them that Yeutter ``has
asked several changes be made'' in the preparation of letters for
his signature.
   ``All correspondence should be on a first name basis when
appropriate,'' the memo said.
   If the incoming correspondence to Yeutter says, ``Dear Clayton,''
that is a hint on how to respond, the memo added. But if it says
``Dear Mr. Secretary,'' letter writers should call the office of
Yeutter's executive secretariat for guidance.

   A smaller cotton crop this year is boosting
prices and signaling a reduction in U.S. inventories, according to
Agriculture Department analysts.
   The department's monthly report last week on farm prices in
August showed upland cotton at an average of 64.3 cents per pound,
up from 60.6 cents in July and 53.9 cents in August 1988.
   A report by the department's Economic Research Service said U.S.
cotton production, based on Aug. 1 indications, is forecast at 11.8
million bales, down from 15.4 million last year.
   The cotton acreage planted for 1989 harvest dropped 16 percent to
10.5 million acres, reflecting a larger acreage reduction required
under USDA's price support program.
   Average cotton yields are forecast at 595 pounds per acre, on the
average, down 4 percent from last year. Yields in the Delta and
Southwest are expected to be down 14 percent and 19 percent,
respectively, because of bad weather.
   The total 1989-90 cotton supply is forecast at 19 million bales
for the marketing year that began Aug. 1.
   Allowing for domestic use and exports, the U.S. cotton inventory
by Aug. 1, 1990, could be pulled down to around 3.9 million bales
from an Aug. 1 carryover this year of 7.5 million bales, the report
said.
   ``Although U.S. cotton textile imports are expected to reach
near-record levels and manmade fiber prices have become more
competitive with cotton, domestic mills will likely use 7.7 million
bales during 1989-90,'' the report said. ``Lower textile inventories
and larger denim production should keep domestic mill consumption
strong this season.''
   Domestic cotton use may rise to and average of 23 pounds per
capita, up two pounds from last year, the report said.

   Farmers who take out government crop price
support loans this month will pay a bit less in interest, says the
Agriculture Department.
   Keith Bjerke, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said the September rate is 8 percent, down
from 8[ percent for loans made in August.
   The reduction by the CCC reflects the rate charged by the U.S.
Treasury in September, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Mayor Marion Barry says he'll fight new
allegations that he used drugs with a convicted drug dealer, and he
wants prosecutors to release his grand jury testimony on the case.
   Barry said Monday he will ask U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens to
release the record of more than five hours of questions Barry
answered about his relationship with Charles Lewis, a former city
employee facing drug charges in the nation's capital. Lewis has been
convicted on cocaine charges in the Virgin Islands.
   ``I'm prepared to ask the prosecutor to release my testimony
before the grand jury and Mr. Lewis' testimony, so therefore the
public can see what was said,'' Barry said at a City Hall news
conference. ``A small group of character assassins have taken it
upon themselves to take the law into their own hands ... to do in
the press what they can't do in court.''
   Barry's move followed news reports that Lewis told prosecutors
that he and Barry repeatedly used crack cocaine in Washington last
December and in the Virgin Islands in early 1988.
   Stephens, who has said he will investigate the news leaks, was
not immediately available to comment Monday on whether the mayor's
testimony would be released.
   ``We have nothing to hide regarding the testimony of the mayor or
Mr. Lewis,'' said Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy.
   The investigation of Lewis continues, and Mundy said release of
Barry's testimony could be difficult to arrange because Barry might
be called as a witness for the prosecution or defense.
   The federal investigation began in January after city police
inexplicably called off an attempt to make an undercover drug buy
from Lewis when they discovered that Barry was in Lewis' hotel room.
Barry has acknowledged making at least six visits to Lewis' room,
but has said he did not see, use or purchase drugs from him.
   Barry has testified twice before a grand jury on his visits with
Lewis.
   The mayor made his remarks with a cadre of supporters at his
side, including his wife Effi, several cabinet members, and the two
co-chairman of his 1990 re-election bid.
   ``Nothing in the recent spate of rumors and innuendoes has caused
the mayor's campaign committee to doubt the mayor's statements on
these issues or to alter our dedication,'' said Robert Johnson, one
of Barry's campaign directors. ``We deplore the use of rumors and
leaks in an attempt to distort the political process in this
community.''
   Barry also denied a WUSA-TV report that he has been encouraged by
top aides to step aside because of the recent allegations.
   ``That's a non-issue,'' Barry said. ``It's not true.''
   The mayor also lashed out at ``unethical members of the media''
and suggested that prosecutors are responsible for the news leaks.
However, the mayor and Johnson both acknowledged they had no proof
that law enforcement officials are responsible for the leaks.

<HEAD>Stallings Denounces Report He Had Sex With Altar Boy 12 Years Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A priest feuding with Roman Catholic Church
authorities over his formation of an African-American congregation
says a report of a homosexual affair between him and an altar boy is
an attack on his ministry.
   Meanwhile, Cardinal James A. Hickey, the archbishop of
Washington, said Monday he ``was sorry to read the allegations''
published in The Washington Post about the Rev. George A. Stallings
Jr.
   ``If it is true, then I feel great sorrow and sympathy for
everyone involved,'' Hickey said as he left a city church. Hickey
would not answer questions.
   Stallings denounced the report.
   ``I will not dignify with a response the scurrilous and baseless
charge reported in today's Washington Post,'' Stallings said. ``I
believe that this charge and accusation is a concerted effort to
divert attention from my mission ... to drive racial insensitivity
and racism out of the Catholic church.''
   A 28-year-old man, whom the Post agreed not to identify, told the
paper he had oral sex two or three times a week with Stallings in a
Washington church rectory for several months in 1977.
   The man, who was then 16 years old, said he never reported the
relationship to church authorities.
   In July, Stallings, 41, formed the Imani Temple, an independent
African-American Catholic congregation in defiance of the Roman
Catholic hierarchy.
   Hickey suspended Stallings in July after the priest formed the
separate African-American congregation.
   Diocesan officials did say that parishioners and other Catholics
had become concerned over Stallings' conduct, the newspaper said.
Stallings had purchased a turn-of-the-century home which he named
Augustus Manor and had a number of young boys in his presence, the
paper said.
   Hickey confronted Stallings about alleged homosexual behavior
three months ago, the paper said.
   William Marshall, spokesman for Stallings, issued a statement
saying ``again, the news media has launched a negative assault on a
black leader.''
   The release said the 12-year-old ``rumors'' from an unnamed
source were ``foolishness.''
   The man told the Post his involvement with the priest was a
``deciding factor'' in his becoming a homosexual. The newspaper said
the man also signed a sworn statement saying that his story was true.
   The man was quoted by the newspaper as saying he became uneasy
with the relationship and broke it off.

   Workers in Cuba searched for more bodies in
the wreckage of a Cuban jetliner and the homes destroyed when the
plane crashed just after taking off in a thunderstorm, killing at
least 150 people, news reports said.
   Most of the dead were Italians on their way home from a Cuban
vacation.
   At least 600 people continued searching for bodies through pieces
of the chartered Cubana de Aviacion jet and what was left of 33
homes in a Havana suburb, Cuba's official news agency Prensa Latina
reported Monday night.
   The Soviet-made Ilyushin 62, bound for Milan, Italy, exploded
Sunday evening shortly after taking off in a heavy thunderstorm from
Havana's Jose Marti airport, Prensa Latina reported.
   The news agency said flaming debris from the jet plummeted into
neighborhoods on the capital's southern outskirts. It quoted the
Municipal People's Committee in Boyeros, the suburb where the crash
occurred, as saying at least 150 people were killed _ 125 on the
plane and 25 on the ground.
   Only one person, an Italian, survived the crash, officials said.
The neighborhood group said 26 people on the ground were hurt, most
of them seriously.
   A taxi driver and his three passengers riding near the airport
were among the injured, Prensa Latina said.
   ``The explosion lit up the sky,'' one injured person told Cuban
television. ``We thought it was all over,'' said another.
   Cuban and Italian authorities had identified 22 bodies by Monday
evening, including four crewmembers and nine people on the ground,
Prensa Latina reported. It did not release names of victims except
44-year-old Cuban film critic Jose Antonio Gonzalez.
   The news agency reported that 104 bodies had been taken to the
medical examiner's office by Monday night.
   The jetliner was carrying 113 Italian tourists, two Cuban
passengers and a crew of 11, said the Cuban Ambassador Javier
Ardizones in Rome. He confirmed there was one survivor, an Italian.
   The survivor was not identified, nor was the survivor's condition
released.
   The cause of the crash was not determined, but a Foreign Ministry
employee in Rome said the weather appeared to be a factor.
   ``It was very bad, a storm, with rain and lightning,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A government commission headed by Rogelio Acevedo, president of
the Civil Aeronautics Institute, was investigating, Prensa Latina
said.
   President Fidel Castro visited the crash site and then went to
hospitals where the injured were taken, suffering extensive burns
and multiple fractures, Prensa Latina said.
   Pope John Paul II sent condolences Monday to the families of
victims.
   Prensa Latina described the accident as the worst in the history
of Cubana de Aviacion.

<HEAD>Emergency Dispatcher Talks Couple Through Delivery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For David and Sharon Bachman, the
Labor Day weekend was just that. The couple delivered their third
child, this time with the help of a 911 emergency dispatcher.
   Fire Department dispatcher Nancy Fuhrmann was on duty before dawn
Sunday when the frantic Bachman called, saying his wife was having
their third child upstairs, unable to move.
   ``A lot of the effort was in calming him down and telling him
that what he was seeing was normal,'' Ms. Fuhrmann said Monday.
   Ms. Fuhrmann told him how to hold the child's head as it comes
out.
   ``The baby is coming out now ... I see it,'' Bachman said at one
point, as his wife's cries were heard in the background. ``She's
pushing! ... Oh! ... There's the baby's head! Oh my God!''
   ``OK, the baby's out!'' he said, breathlessly.
   ``OK, that's great! Congratulations,'' the dispatcher replied.
   Paramedics arrived at the three-story condominium as the child's
head was appearing, but couldn't get inside the security gate,
Bachman said. After the child was delivered, he rushed down to let
the paramedics in and shouted ``It's a boy!''
   Mrs. Bachman, 24, and little Bryan Allen Bachman returned home
from the hospital late Monday and were doing fine, according to the
25-year-old father, who runs a car lubrication service called
``Greased Lightning.''

   Stroh Brewing Co. withdrew $600,000 in
financing for National Audubon Society television specials to save
money and not because of a threatened boycott by loggers unhappy
about an upcoming program on Northwestern forests, the company says.
   ``I want to stress any consideration or thought of canceling
future contributions to the Audubon Society's program productions is
completely independent from concerns related to the upcoming program
``Ancient Forests: Rage Over Trees,''' said Lacey Logan, a
spokeswoman for the Detroit-based brewery.
   But environmental sources, who spoke on the condition they remain
anonymous, said the company had suggested to the Audubon Society
that changes be made in the program to ``make it more favorable to
the loggers'' and that the money was withdrawn when the society
refused to change the program.
   The timber industry and environmentalists have been fighting for
months over the future of logging in the Northwest's old growth
forests, which provide prime habitat for the northern spotted owl.

   A state visit by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has

   The Sept. 14 visit was canceled ``due to the pursuit of the peace

   That was the same reason given for the last delay in July. Saudi

   Hundreds of thousands of Americans living in other countries are
not filing the required tax returns, according to a study by Bryan
L. Musselman of the Internal Revenue Service. In 1986, the General
Accounting Office the losses at between $620 million to $2 billion a

   In 1988, a new law covered Americans who apply for new passports

<HEAD>Five Arrested for Trying to Sell Uranium to American Embassy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Japanese tried to sell 8.8 pounds of uranium to
the American Embassy in Tokyo and have been arrested for illegal
possesion of nuclear substances, police announced today.
   The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department said the group brought a
capsule containing about 3.5 ounces of uranium to the U.S. Embassy
in Tokyo in early August and offered another 8.8 pounds of the same
substance for $83 million.
   They identified the ringleader as a 43-year-old woman, Toshiko
Nishijima. They provided no further details about her.
   Uranium is a radioactive chemical element, used for nuclear power
generation and nuclear bombs.
   The embassy immediately notified the Japanese police and handed
over the substance, which was sent to the Science and Technology
Agency for analysis. It concluded the capsule contained refined
natural uranium of 70.7 percent purity.
   The agency said only 0.71 percent of the uranium was uranium-235,
the element used for power generation and for bombs, while 99
percent of the substance was uranium-238.
   ``At this point, we have not obtained the remaining uranium and
we can't say how large the entire scheme is,'' said Takaharu
Ushikoshi, head of police department's public security section.
``But we believe the substance was brought in from abroad and there
must be collaborators who helped to smuggle it into Japan.''
   Ushikoshi also said police do not believe the group is related to
terrorists or politically motivated. ``It looks like the group's
intent was purely money,'' he said.
   He said police arrested the five last week and have been
interrogating them to determine where the 8.8 pounds of remaining
uranium is kept, where the substance came from and whether there are
other collaborators.
   ``One of them has stated that they bought 4 kilograms (8.8
pounds) of uranium from an unidentified person for 5 billion yen
($35 million) and someone is keeping it at a cost of 3 million yen
($20,690) a day,'' said Ushikoshi. ``We believe the remaining
uranium is kept somewhere in Japan.''
   He also said the group offered the uranium to the American
embassy because ``they probably thought ordinary people or companies
wouldn't buy such an outrageous thing.''
   The American embassy declined to comment, saying the case was not
a diplomatic matter but rather a police matter. Police declined to
give details of who was contacted at the embassy and how.
   Police said the uranium was ``very dangerous to the public.''
Nuclear experts said 8.8 pounds of uranium could make a powerful
atomic bomb.
   ``Whether it can make a atomic bomb or not depends on the purity
of uranium, but what matters is there are people who can obtain 4
kilograms of 70 percent pure uraninum, which undoubtedly can create
a very powerful explosive,'' said Kazuhisa Ogawa, an prominent
defense analyst and expert on military technology.
   ``It is very unlikely that the uranium was obtained from Japanese
nuclear facilities because the security system of Japan's nuclear
facilities are extremely tight,'' he added. ``But there are many
ways to smuggle in small amount of uranium from other countries,
where the management of nuclear substance is much looser.''
   Officials of the Science and Techonology Agency said the uranium
brought by the group was not harmful to human body unless it is
directly touched or swallowed.
   The five could face up to a year in prison or a fine of maximum
of $3,500.

<HEAD>Abortion Ruling Spurs Action on Both Sides of Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DESIREE WARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deb Morse was angry with the U.S. Supreme
Court's recent abortion ruling and decided to join her local chapter
of the National Organization for Women.
   But she found that her community, La Crosse, no longer had one.
That didn't stop her, though, as she set out to revive the city's
NOW chapter.
   Ms. Morse said she would have considered the group's first
meeting a success if 10 people attended.
   Instead, nearly 100 men and women showed up last week to express
displeasure at the high court's decision to uphold key restrictions
in a Missouri abortion law. They also started to devise a plan of
action.
   ``We're really going to have to do something quickly and
concrete,'' Ms. Morse said. ``We want to let the legislators ...
know how we feel and how strong that feeling is.''
   The NOW revival is not unique to the western Wisconsin city of
about 50,000 on the banks of the Mississippi River.
   Kim Gandy, NOW's national secretary-treasurer, said the
organization has grown steadily since its inception in 1966, but
membership has sharply increased with many younger members since the
court's July 3 decision. The group has about 200,000 members around
the country.
   The ruling effectively returned regulation of abortions to state
legislatures. The court also agreed to hear three other abortion
cases this fall.
   The renewed debate also has brought new members to anti-abortion
forces.
   Marilyn Fitterman, president of New York's NOW chapters, said
membership in her state has increased from to 24,000 from 17,500
last year, mostly because of concerns about the court's changing
stance on abortion.
   Ms. Fitterman said three new chapters in western New York have
started since July.
   ``I think the Supreme Court has garnered the movement themselves
with their decision because people are quite upset with it,'' she
said. ``When I listen to my messages, I get at least two or three
people a day who want to join and volunteer their time and
contribute money, and another two who just want to join.''
   Jennifer Jackman, NOW president for Massachusetts, said there are
about 9,000 state members, but the Boston chapter alone has received
about 2,000 inquiries since July. And five new chapters are starting
elsewhere in the state, including two at high schools in Lexington
and Cambridge, she said.
   ``Without question this issue has really galvanized younger
women,'' Ms. Jackman said. ``More and more young women are getting
involved. They realize that this is a right that should be national,
it's that important.''
   Madeline Para, NOW coordinator for Wisconsin, said after the 1973
Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, advocates
of women's rights felt the abortion issue was settled. Many local
NOW chapters disbanded.
   But this year's Missouri abortion law ruling revived the battle,
she said.
   ``Now we're fighting for what we'd already won, and it's not as
much fun as fighting for new things,'' she said.
   On the other side of the issue, the Wisconsin Right to Life has
enlisted 4,100 households in the state since July, bringing
membership to 33,000, according to spokeswoman Lori Clark.
   Nancy Myers, media relations director at Right to Life's national
office in Washington, D.C., didn't know the group's membership
around the country, but said many have joined since July.
   For instance, she said Kansas' chapters increased to 14 from 12,
and Virginia's chapters have started several small weekend meetings
to accomodate new members.
   NOW, meanwhile, is planning a second national rally in
Washington, D.C. The first was in April; the next one is planned for
Nov. 12 at the Lincoln Memorial.
   ``The rally isn't going to be a `Silent Scream,''' said Ms.
Fitterman in a reference to the anti-abortion movement's trademark
video of the same name. ``We're going to fight on the state and
national levels to win.''

<HEAD>EPA Veto of Dam Relieves Town That Would Be Flooded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS M. SEARLES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DECKERS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A riverside community that would be flooded
for a Denver reservoir if plans go ahead for a 615-foot-high dam
reacted with disbelief when an Environmental Protection Agency
review blasted the project.
   ``I kind of halfway sat there stunned,'' said Fannie Roth, 70,
who has been battling the Two Forks project for 17 years.
   ``I was hoping it was true _ it numbed me that it really, really
was not going to be built,'' Roth said in an interview in the home
she built among the pines above the South Fork of the South Platte
River.
   If Two Forks were built, her home ``would be under approximately
300 feet of water _ if they ever had the water to fill it,'' Roth
said.
   Lee DeHihns, an EPA deputy regional administrator from Atlanta
who was assigned to review the project, announced Aug. 29 that the
agency would press on with a veto process begun last March by EPA
administrator William Reilly. A two-month public hearing period is
the next step, followed by a final decision by EPA administrators in
Washington, D.C.
   DeHihns said his five-month review concluded that the Denver
metropolitan area's future water needs did not warrant the
environmental toll of the proposed $500 million to $1 billion
project.
   The dam would be located 25 miles southwest of Denver near the
confluence of the South Platte River and its North Fork. Besides
flooding Deckers, the project would inundate scenic canyon lands and
30 miles of stream known for prized trout, and it would damage
wildlife habitat in Nebraska, the EPA said.
   Deckers, a community of 180 people, lies 50 miles southwest of
Denver over winding country roads. Visitors who brave a 10-mile
stretch of narrow, teeth-chattering washboard road with second-gear
hairpin turns, steep grades and washouts are mostly attracted by the
South Fork's legendary trout fishing.
   After the Denver Water Board and 42 metropolitan-area water
providers proposed the dam, many homeowners panicked and sold their
property to the board, diminishing the community's tax resources for
road maintenance and law enforcement. Also, residents found their
telephone service was not updated over the years, because it was
assumed the entire exchange would be flooded.
   ``The people that are still landowners here, you can rest
assured, didn't want the dam. I worked a lifetime for what I own
here. I want to continue living here until I die,'' said Roth, who
moved to Deckers in 1953 after retiring as a Denver Public Schools
bus driver and stays busy with carpentry, bowling and pitching
horseshoes.
   She and her neighbors say they will attempt to obtain protection
for the South Platte under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act with the
help of the Washington-based American Rivers organization.
   ``I'm glad the EPA said no,'' said Shirley Childs, a clerk at the
Deckers general store and a 25-year resident of the area. ``I'll
pray to God they continue saying no.''
   The veto decision came as a relief to Al Barnes, who has been
visiting or living in the area for 35 years.
   His wife, Mary, said the EPA is ``finally going to look at things
like this _ and protect some of this country.
   ``We are elated the EPA stuck to its guns,'' Mrs. Barnes said.
``Number one, this is our home, the thing I went through several
wars for and the dream of a home in the mountains _ so my great
grandchildren can come up here and enjoy the clean air and the water
and the wildlife.''
   The Barnes' home, looking across the South Fork at Long Scraggy
Peak, was a three-room cabin that they added a second floor to when
he retired from the Air Force missile development program six years
ago.
   Despite the long battle with the Denver Water Board to stop Two
Forks, Roth and the Barnes said the conflict has been amicable in
recent years.
   ``The Big Stick time was in the '60s, when it was `We're the
Denver Water Board and by God ...''' Barnes recalled.
   ``But the new water board has been in the '80s, since Mayor
(Federico) Pena came to office. Since then, the whole context of the
water board has mellowed down,'' said Mrs. Barnes.

<HEAD>All-Day Search Yields No Trace of Plane That Disappeared Over Amazon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite picking up the plane's
emergency signal, rescuers were still trying to locate a Varig
jetliner that disappeared over the Amazon jungle with 54 people
aboard, an air force spokesman said.
   The Boeing 737-200 was far off course, low on fuel and flying on
one engine with faulty navigational equipment when it vanshed Sunday
while on a domestic flight, air force spokesman Col. Ronaldo Borges
said Monday.
   It was on the last leg of a regularly scheduled flight from the
southeastern city of Sao Paulo to Belem.
   ``The plane's beacon emits an emergency signal that is being
picked up. But it takes time to pinpoint the exact spot where the
signal is coming from and we have not located the plane yet,''
Borges said.
   He said the search for the plane was suspended Monday night
because of darkness but air force planes, private planes and
helicopters would resume their work early this morning.
   The colonel said officials did not rule out the possibility the
plane was hijacked.
   Varig airline officials denied various Brazilian press accounts
that said the plane had landed safely with all aboard alive.
   Joao Luis de Souza, a company spokesman in Rio, said the reports
were ``completely false.''
   A Varig official in Belem, who asked not to be identified, also
denied the reports.
   ``We've checked two rumors, one that the plane landed in Amazonas
state and another that it landed on an Indian reservation in
southern Para state. But nothing has been confirmed,'' he said.
   Varig provided a list of 48 passengers and 6 crew members, all
Brazilian, who were on the plane when it disappeared.
   Borges said the plane's pilot took off from the city of Maraba at
5:25 p.m. to make a 40-minute flight to Belem, capital of Para
state, 2,140 miles northwest of Rio at the mouth of the Amazon
river. Borges said the pilot noted in his flight plan that he had
fuel for about three hours.
   But Borges said the plane's pilot strayed far from his route and
radioed the airport at Carajas, 600 miles from Belem at 8:30 local
time, asking for runway lights to be lit so he could land.
   Ten minutes later, a Cruzeiro airline plane received the pilot's
last communication, saying he was flying at 8,000 feet with only one
engine working and would try to make an emergency landing in the
jungle guided by a forest fire, Borges said.
   Borges said the plane's pilot had been in contact with other
planes and airports after leaving Maraba but never said anything
about being lost, though he had complained of problems with his
navigational equipment.
   Based on information provided by other planes in the air at the
time of the flight and by satellites that monitor Brazilian
airspace, officials believe the Boeing may have gone down near the
Xingu Indian reservation in the southern part of Para state, Borges
said.
   But he said the plane could have covered over 1,200 miles during
its flight of over three hours, which made locating the plane
extremely difficult.
   The plane took off early Sunday morning from Sao Paulo, Brazil's
largest city with 10 million residents, and made regular stops in
Uberaba, Uberlandia, Goiania, Brasilia, Imperatriz and Maraba.
   The possibilty of a plane having been hijacked ``could not be
discarded,'' Borges said.

   Former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos'
blood pressure dropped to an extremely low level before his
condition stabilized, spokesmen said.
   Marcos, 71, remained in critical condition late Monday at St.
Francis Medical Center where he has been since Jan. 15 for multiple
organ failures, said Dr. George L. Druger, a pulminary specialist on
the medical team treating the exiled leader.
   Marcos' condition began to deteriorate Saturday and by Sunday,
``his blood pressure was down to an alarmingly low level,'' said
Roger Peyuan, a family spokesman.
   Druger said the pressure was stabilized with medications by early
Monday.
   Marcos, who has been in critical condition since late May,
suffers from heart failure, kidney failure and respiratory failure.
   He remains on a respirator and has daily kidney dialysis,
according to doctors.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, and other relatives and friends gathered at
the hospital Monday night as Marcos underwent dialysis that had been
postponed Sunday while doctors battled to restore his blood
pressure, Peyuan said.
   Marcos and his family have lived in Hawaii since they fled the
Philippines during a popular uprising in Feburary 1986 that brought
President Corazon Aquino to power.

<TEXT>
   Despite repeated interventions by the central bank,
the U.S. dollar rose to a 2{-month high against the Japanese yen
today, while stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined
slightly.
   The dollar closed at 146.65 yen, up 0.52 yen from Monday's close.
The currency opened at 145.85 yen and moved in a range between
145.80 yen and 146.65 yen.
   It was the highest close since June 15, when the U.S. unit
finished at 150.30 yen.
   Currency dealers said the Bank of Japan continued to intervene at
levels above 146 yen as Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto indicated
in a Tuesday morning press conference that the central bank would
continue to invervene in the currency market.
   The central bank does not confirm or deny its intervention
activities.
   ``We have no intention of approving a situation that includes
violent exchange rate swings,'' Hashimoto said in a press conference
following a regular Cabinet meeting.
   The dollar's recent rise, which makes Japanese products easier to
sell in the United States, raises fears that improvements in Japan's
trade surplus may be slowed.
   ``The general sentiment of the market is still toward the bullish
dollar, but the anxiety about the central bank's intervention is
keeping the currency from moving up as high as it wants to go,''
said a dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank, speaking anonymously.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 135.56 points Monday, fell 41.83 points, or
0.12 percent, to finish at 34,441.95.
   The main barometer of the market started the day in a bullish
mood as exchange rates showed signs of stability. It declined
moderately in afternoon trading as the Japanese yen lost ground
against the U.S. dollar.
   Securities dealer said the relative stability in the currency
market encouraged the investors to buy new stocks in the morning.
   ``The market participants seem to share the feeling it is about
time that the market turn bullish,'' said a dealer at Nikko
Securities Co. ``But trading was still relatively light Tuesday.''
   But dealers said a September rally cannot be expected until
exchange rates settle down.

<HEAD>Iranian Official Urges U.S. Free Iranian Assets To Help Hostages'
Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western hostages in Lebanon could be
released if the United States shows its good will by freeing
billions of dollars in Iranian assets, a senior Iranian official
says.
   The call was echoed in an interview published today of a Shiite
Moslem cleric in Lebanon who is believed to be a spiritual leader of
the kidnappers.
   Iranian media on Monday quoted Ali Mohammed Besharati, Iran's
deputy foreign minister, as saying that as ``a sign of good will,
the United States should denounce the interference in Iranian
affairs by previous administrations and release the Iranian assets
with no conditions attached.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, also quoted Besharati as saying President Bush sent several
letters, the latest three weeks ago, to the Iranian government.
   ``In these letters, the U.S. mentioned issues including Iran-U.S.
relations and the Lebanese situation,'' he said.
   Iran did not reply in writing, he said, but an oral response
``was definitely given through messengers.'' Besharati did not
identify the messengers.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, where Bush has been vacationing, White
House spokesman Roman Popadiuk responded: ``There has been no
message sent by the president to the Iranian leadership.''
   Besharati said the hostages ``may be released'' if the United
States turns loose the billions of dollars worth of assets,
including military hardware, frozen after the storming of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran in 1979.
   Iranian officials and news media have in recent months sent
conflicting signals to the United States about whether unfreezing
the assets would help secure freedom for the hostages.
   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, most by radical
Shiite Moslems loyal to Iran. Eight are Americans and the one held
longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   In its report on an interview with Besharati by the
English-language Tehran Times, IRNA said he believed Bush was making
greater efforts toward conciliation than did Ronald Reagan.
   ``We see the Bush administration has tried to undo many things of
the past,'' Besharati said.
   Hopes for a more moderate attitude toward the West have been
raised by the death June 3 of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's
revolutionary patriarch, and the election to the presidency July 28
of Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of the ``pragmatist'' faction that
supports closer ties with the West.
   Because of the closed nature of Iranian politics, it is difficult
to assess whether the Besharati comments signaled a new willingness
to negotiate freedom for the hostages.
   Last month, Rafsanjani offered to help work for their release if
the United States adopted a friendlier policy toward Iran, and he
cited frozen Iranian assets as one sore point.
   In an apparent struggle between radical and pragmatist factions
within the Iranian government, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's
spiritual leader, said Aug. 14 that there would be no dealings with
the United States. But Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati on the
same day left open the possibility.
   The day before, IRNA outlined conditions for release of the
hostages, citing the assets.
   An Iranian newspaper, Kayhan International, said Aug. 15 that
unfreezing the assets would not guarantee Iranian help in freeing
the hostages.
   The next day it said the United States can only improve its ties
with Iran by releasing the assets.
   Besharati has made several trips to Lebanon in recent years and
is believed to have influence with Hezbollah, or Party of God, the
pro-Iranian group believed to sponsor Shiite kidnap gangs.
   In an interview published today in the Washington Post, Sheik
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, believed to be Hezbollah's spiritual
leader, said the Bush administration should stop seeing moves for
unfreezing U.S.-held Iranian financial assets as a potential ransom.
   ``Iran sees that its relations with America do not revolve around
assets and hostages, but around what it considers hostile American
policies against Iran,'' he was quoted as saying in an interview
Saturday at his villa in southern Beirut.
   ``The release of the assets would be an indication of America's
distancing itself from hostile policies,'' he said.
   Fadlallah also called on the United States to look for
``opportunities to improve the conditions and suffering in the cirle
of (Arab) detainees or hostages'' held by Israel or Lebanese
factions, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>More Than 300 East Germans Flood Prague Mission</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Refugees, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 East Germans hoping
to flee to the West have taken refuge in Bonn's embassy in Prague,
creating a ``critical'' situation inside the mission, a diplomat was
quoted as saying today.
   Michael Steiner of the West German Embassy told the Communist
party daily Rude Pravo of a ``continuous influx'' of East Germans
who have camped out on the mission's grounds.
   The mission, housed in the Baroque Lobkowicz palace in Prague's
Mala Strana district, was closed to the public Aug. 23 after about
140 East Germans were reported to have taken refuge there seeking
safe passage to West Germany.
   Scores more have since arrived, apparently climbing over an
unguarded seven-foot fence that surrounds the well-tended embassy
park. Giant tents have been erected in the grounds to house the
refugees.
   Prague government officials have not said if whether they will
follow Hungary's more reform-minded leadership in allowing the East
Germans to go to West Germany.
   Czechoslovakia's entrenched Communist leadership is close to East
German leader Erich Honecker, and seems unlikely to offend him by
allowing the East Germans to flee to the West.
   Bonn was forced to shut its Prague embassy in October 1984, when
about 160 East Germans sought refuge there. They returned home to
East Germany in January 1985 after a hunger strike failed to win
them exit visas, and it is not known if they ever were allowed to
leave later for West Germany.
   Rude Pravo said the embassy compound is currently only ``a
distant reminder of a diplomatic mission.''
   Steiner was said to have praised the ``attitude of Czechoslovakia
as a host country as entirely correct in the solution of technical
matters connected with this extraordinary situation.''
   Several temporary West German visa offices have been opened at
different points around Prague to cope with the task of issuing up
to 6,000 visas a day requested by Czechoslovaks, who are enjoying
new freedom to travel to the West.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Can't Guarantee Taxes Won't Go Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he has to harness his
tendency to sometimes get emotional.
   ``We Bushes cry easily,'' he told British journalist David Frost
in an interview on the lawn of his home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   The interview was taped Aug. 29 and is scheduled for television
broadcast tonight on Public Broadcasting System.
   Already, Bush has had to contend with the July 31 claim by
terrorists that they had hanged Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, and
the deaths of 47 USS Iowa crewmen during the April 19 explosion
aboard the ship.
   ``And those get me,'' he said. ``I'm not good at expressing the
concerns of a nation, in matters of national concern like that. I'm
just not very good at it, and so you try not to choke up.
   ``You try to say what you really think, but I feel very moved
when I see those kinds of tragedies. You feel a certain
responsibility, you feel a certain frustration, particularly in
terms of these hostages,'' he said.
   Bush said he recalls turning down several drafts of a speech
about the Iowa because he thought he would become too emotional.
   On July 31, a videotape of Higgins hanging from a noose was
released in Lebanon, and a pro-Iranian Shiite faction claimed
responsibility for the death of the U.S. hostage.
   ``When I saw Colonel Higgins' body displayed in that brutal,
cruel fashion, I had this visceral reaction of wanting to do
something. I still want to do something,'' Bush said.
   ``If I could find a way to surgically go in and free those
American hostages, I would do it.''
   Asked if he expects to renew diplomatic ties with Iran, Bush
replied, ``I'd like to think we could see that day, and I'd welcome
it.
   ``But there has to be a certain modicum of international
decency,'' Bush said, referring to the reported link between Iran
and terrorist groups holding U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   ``From time to time their officials make statements indicating
they have some control over that situation,'' he said. ``That's got
to change dramatically, before there can be the kind of relations
that I personally would like to see with Iran.''
   Bush also said he will fulfill his campaign pledge to fight for
``no more taxes,'' but added that he can't guarantee Congress won't
act ``in strange and mysterious'' fiscal ways.
   ``What I'm trying to do is fulfill that pledge by going forward
step by step on the budget without raising taxes,'' he said.
   When asked whether he is committed to the tax pledge for his full
four-year term, the president said, ``We're going to succeed this
first year ... and then we've gotta see what happens, but it is my
intention to fight every inch of the way for no more taxes.''

<HEAD>Officials Say Lawmaker Tried To Smuggle In Hundreds of Guns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customs officials seized more than 300
rifles and handguns from a Philippine congressman and his companion
today after they arrived from the United States, authorities said.
   Zafiro Respicio, chief customs collector at Ninoy Aquino
International Airport, said 314 guns were found in nine bags
identified as belonging to Rep. Nicanor de Guzman and Ponciano Dato.
   The two arrived today on a Philippine Airlines flight from San
Francisco. The guns included .25-caliber and .45-caliber pistols,
.38-caliber revolvers and several assault rifles, Respicio said.
   Respicio said the shipment was discovered when the baggage passed
through the airport's X-ray machines. He also said de Guzman did not
have necessary documents for importing the weapons.
   He said smuggling charges were being prepared against de Guzman
and Dato. The weapons were estimated to be worth $139,000, Respicio
said.
   De Guzman is a member of the Struggle of the Democratic Filipino,
a political party that supports President Corazon Aquino.
   Officials said the bags were being carried by Dato and that the
congressman had left the airport before the shipment was discovered.
   In a radio interview, de Guzman denied the bags containing the
weapons were his and claimed he did not know Dato. De Guzman said he
had been in the United States for about two weeks and that he would
not have had enough time to buy so many weapons under U.S. law.
   De Guzman said he would resign if officials could prove the
weapons were his. House Speaker Ramon Mitra said he was forming a
three-member panel to investigate.
   Mrs. Aquino said she would order Philippine Airlines offices in
the United States to tighten procedures for inspecting baggage
destined for Manila.
   Weapons smuggling is widespread in the Philippines, and officials
estimate there are more than 180,000 unregistered firearms in the
country.
   Also today, customs chief Salvador Mison said inspectors at the
port of Manila found 23 handguns in six boxes sent by a Filipino
living in the United States.
   Officials say the proliferation of unlicensed weapons is a major
cause of the rise of street killings here.
   The incident occurred amid a widely publicized dispute between
Mrs. Aquino and the House of Representatives, the more
pro-administration of the two chambers of Congress.
   Last year, the House tried to import hundreds of pistols, Uzi
submachine guns and Galil assault rifles because members said they
needed additional protection.
   But the guns were turned over to the military and customs
officials after Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos ruled the weapons were
illegally imported. That led to a public outcry over the deal.
   Last week, Mrs. Aquino ordered the confiscated weapons to be
burned to show her ``strong commitment'' to fighting crime.
   But the plan was aborted after Mitra and other congressmen
complained that they had not exhausted all legal appeals for release
of the weapons.

   The dollar rose in moderately active European
trading today despite repeated intervention by the Bank of Japan in
earlier Asian trading.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   Traders said repeated dollar sales by the Japanese central bank
had raised fears of concerted central bank action in Europe, but
that no other major central banks had been sighted in the open
market by midmorning.
   Market participants said the central banks' actions would be
crucial to a market that has little else to trade on. No major U.S.
economic indicators are scheduled for release this week.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.52 yen to a closing 146.65 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 147.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.9891 West German marks, up from 1.9780
   _1.7180 Swiss francs, up from 1.7085
   _6.7073 French francs, up from 6.6725

   _1,425.50 Italian lire, up from 1,417.50
   _1.1828 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1815
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.5403 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5532 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $358.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $359.00. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $358.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $358.20 compared with $359.00 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 22 cents to close at a bid
359.28.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of 5.06 dollars a troy
ounce, barely changed from Monday's 5.05.

<HEAD>Heavy Rains in Northern Florida Causes Some Flooding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms dumped rain from northern Florida and southern
Georgia to the central Gulf Coast region early today, causing
flooding in some areas. Elsewhere, snow was forecast tonight in the
northern Rockies.
   On Monday, Sandlewood, Fla., received more than 6 inches of rain,
with nearly 3 inches falling in a one-hour period. Jacksonville
Beach, Fla., had nearly 5 inches of rain on top of nearly 2 inches
that fell on Sunday. Street flooding was reported at Sandlewood and
Jacksonville.
   Moisture from the Gulf of California continued to stream
northward and help produce showers and thunderstorms over New
Mexico. Some of the rainfall was locally heavy. Cloudcraft, N.M.,
for instance, received over three-quarters of an inch of rain.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed early this morning across
southeast Colorado, north-central Oklahoma and south-central Kansas.
A flash flood watch was in effect for central and south-central
Kansas.
   Hurricane Gabrielle grew stronger today over the middle Atlantic,
packing 130 mph winds as it churned toward Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands.
   Gabrielle's center was expected to pass north of the islands
today, thrusting hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph as far as
100 miles northward.
   In Montana, a winter storm watch was posted for tonight and
Wednesday in higher elevations. A cold front was expected to bring
snow to the northern Rockies.
   A large high pressure system centered off the coast of Maine
brought clear skies and cool temperatures to much of the northeast
quarter of the nation.
   The high in the nation Monday was 113 degrees at Borrego Springs,
Calif.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from the eastern Gulf of Mexico region and Florida to the middle
Mississippi Valley, Kansas and the northern Rockies; snow over the
northern Rockies; and strong and gusty winds across Wyoming.
   Predicted highs: in the 60s over southeast New England and from
north-central Montana to Washington state; in the 70s from Oregon
into the northern Intermountain region, from the Great Lakes region
to the northern and middle Atlantic Coast and along the California
coast; in the 90s from Florida across the lower Mississippi Valley,
the southern Plains, portions of the central and southern Rockies,
the southern Plateau into interior California and over western
portions of South Dakota and Nebraska; near 100 degrees from central
Texas to the Rio Grande Valley; from 100 to 115 degrees over the

<HEAD>More Than 900 Pounds of Heroin Seized, Biggest Ever In Colony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police raided a house in this British colony and
seized $420 million worth of ``China white'' heroin in what is
believed to be the third largest seizure of the drug, authorities
said today.
   Officers grabbed 924 pounds of more than 90 percent pure heroin
along with two automatic pistols and radio scanners used to monitor
police activity during their raid on the house Monday afternoon.
   Police officials said the drugs were probably bound for the
United States and Australia and were an indication of Hong Kong's
growing role as a conduit of heroin from the Southeast Asia's
``Golden Triangle''.
   Two men, a lifeguard and a driver, and two women, both
homemakers, were arrested at four different locations after the
raid, said Tsang Yam-pui, chief staff officer of the Narcotics
Bureau.
   He told a news conference that the unidentified men and women
were not married and that they would be charged with drug-related
offenses later this week. Police were still looking for three other
men.
   Tsang estimated the street value of the drugs at $420 million.
According to U.S. statistics, it would be enough to supply one out
of every five U.S. addicts for a year.
   Tsang said the seizure capped a 6-month probe of the drug ring.
He said the drugs, which were wrapped in brown paper and displayed
at the news conference, had been smuggled through Thailand and
arrived in Hong Kong by boat after passing through both
international and Chinese waters.
   The drugs arrived in Hong Kong several days ago and more than 100
police officers had been hot on the trail since, he said.
   The drug raid apparently was the second biggest seizure of
``China white'' heroin and the third biggest seizure of heroin ever.
   In January 1988, authorities seized 1.1 tons of ``China white''
packed into bales of rubber on a U.S.-bound ship in the Gulf of
Thailand. In January 1982, authorities in Iran grabbed 1,411 pounds
of ``brown sugar'' heroin, the drug's Middle Eastern variety.
   Tsang said the seizure, which comes at a time of falling heroin
use in Hong Kong, was an indication that gangs here are looking for
international markets for heroin.
   The Hong Kong government today released a report that said new
reports of drug addiction fell in 1988 by about 11 percent when
compared to 1987.
   For several years, U.S. authorities have said Chinese gangs,
based in Hong Kong and Thailand with connections in America, were
moving into the heroin racket in the United States.
   The most recent case illustrating this trend was the FBI's
``Operation White Mare,'' which resulted in the seizure of 828
pounds of ``China white'' in three locations in New York City in
February.
   Arrests were made in the United States, Singapore and Hong Kong.
   The drugs in both the ``White Mare'' case and today's case came
from the ``Golden Triangle,'' which comrpises the border areas of
Thailand, Burma and Laos.
   Tsang said Burma's production of opium, which is the raw material
of heroin, has apparently doubled this year to 2,400 tons.

   Hundreds of thousands of blacks
went on strike today on the eve of segregated elections, and
Archbishop Desmond Tutu angrily accused police of desecrating his
church in breaking up rallies.
   Leading anti-apartheid groups and the country's two largest black
labor federations have endorsed the planned two-day strike, another
action in a nationwide defiance campaign protesting the exclusion of
blacks from Wednesday's parliamentary balloting.
   The campaign has included mass strolls by blacks on
``whites-only'' beaches and anti-government demonstrations by whites
and blacks that police have broken up with tear gas, water cannon
and batons.
   On Monday, police detained Tutu and fellow anti-apartheid
activist the Rev. Allan Boesak for 90 minutes after they refusing to
move away from a Cape Town church when police blocked its door with
an armored truck.
   ``They have gone berserk,'' Tutu said of police. ``I want to say
to the world that the terrorists in South Africa are the South
African government.''
   In the major cities of Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town today
it appeared students and trade union members were striking, but most
other black workers were on the job.
   Rush-hour traffic into cities was only slightly less heavy than
usual, according to several reports.
   The National Union of Mineworkers, the country's largest union,
said 78,000 members at 16 mines refused to go underground for their
morning shifts. Tens of thousands of miners were expected to join
the strike later in the day, the union said.
   Employers in heavily unionized industries said they expected the
strike, and most have adopted a ``no work, no pay, no punishment''
stance toward the workers.
   Across the country, black, mixed-race and Indian schools were
closed. Youths built burning-tire street barricades in the townships
outside Durban and in Soweto, the huge black city on the outskirts
of Johannesburg.
   Two bombs exploded overnight in mixed-race areas of Cape Town,
but there were no injuries and damage was minimal, police said.
   Activists tossed two hand grenades at a police station in Soweto,
and gasoline bombs at three homes belonging to black policemen near
Durban. No injuries were reported, police said.
   At the multi-racial University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg,
classes were canceled, but about 500 students and administrators
held an anti-election rally.
   ``There is something terribly wrong with those who rule us if
they cannot understand why such protest is occurring,'' said Colin
Webb, the white vice-principal of the university. ``Are they so deaf
that they cannot hear ... the frustratuion of South Africans who are
deprived of the privileges of citizenship?''
   In Wednesday's election, the National Party, which has ruled
South Africa for 41 years, is favored to keep control of the
dominant white chamber of Parliament. However, it is likely to lose
seats to both the far-right Conservative Party and the
anti-apartheid Democratic Party.
   Analysts predict the Nationalists will capture less than 50
percent of the white vote for the first time since 1953. However,
almost anything above 40 percent will allow them to win enough
individual districts to hold a majority in the white chamber.
   There also are polls for the Indian and mixed-race chambers.
Blacks, who make up 28 million of South Africa's 37 million people,
are excluded.
   Under the country's apartheid policies, the 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain segregated schools, neighborhoods
and hospitals.
   Acting President F.W. de Klerk said in campaign speech Monday
night that white domination must end, but in a way that does not
lead to whites being dominated.
   ``Discrimination must be eliminated. There is no other
alternative,'' he told a supportive National Party crowd of about
600 people in Johannesburg. But he said one-man, one-vote on a
common voters roll would mean black domination of whites.
   Shortly after de Klerk spoke, Cape Town police detained Tutu and
Boesak at when they refused to leave the Central Mission Methodist
Church, where people were trying to assembly for an anti-election
rally.
   Tutu said police also desecrated his church nearby, St. George's
Anglican Cathedral, when they entered it Monday evening. Police
ordered the church closed, barred people from coming in, and
temporarily kept the cathedral dean outside. He held a
reconsecration service this morning.
   ``The South African Police sank to new depths last night when
they desecrated my cathedral,'' said Tutu, head of the Anglican
Church in southern Africa. ``Everywhere in the world the church has
been recognized as a place of sanctuary, even by the craziest of
dictators.''

<HEAD>Shark Bite Victim Videotaped His Attacker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A scuba diver said he videotaped a shark
attacking him and used the camera to beat the animal back until he
could swim to safety.
   ``All I could see was its snout,'' Larry Stroup said Monday. ``It
was butting its head against my camera. What surprised me was when
he reached out and grabbed my arm.''
   The camera captured the entire incident, Stroup said. He said
another diver who viewed the tape said it showed the shark
``waggling back and forth, like they do in the movies'' as it clung
to his arm.
   The 46-year-old real estate developer from Albuquerque, N.M.,
displayed his bandaged limbs during a news conference at Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center.
   Dr. Annie Hollister, an orthopedic surgeon, said Stroup would
remain at the facility for four or five days so he could be watched
for signs of infection. She said there a possibility of nerve damage
affecting movement of his thumb.
   Stroup said he was filming a school of about 10 blue sharks,
which were between seven and 10 feet long, about 15 miles off Santa
Barbara Island on Sunday when he swam out of a protective shark cage
to get a better shot.
   ``If as long as there is no erratic behavior it's OK to get out
of the cage,'' he said. Her added that the blue shark ``is not
terribly aggressive.''
   But this particular blue shark bumped his camera about four
times, he said. ``I didn't feel him bite. I just looked over and his
mouth was around my arm,'' he said.
   Using his camera and helped by a fellow diver, he warded off the
shark, and Stroup swam about 35 feet to their boat. A Coast Guard
helicopter flew him to the hospital, where he underwent surgery to
repair torn ligaments and muscle.
   Santa Barbara Island is about 40 miles southwest of Los Angeles.
   Stroup, a diver for five years, said it was his first expedition
to observe sharks.
   ``I'm sure I'll go diving again. Right now I'm not so sure I'll
go shark diving,'' he said. ``I would say that I have a little more
respect for sharks.''

   A left-wing kibbutz movement has called on
Israeli soldiers to refuse to carry out illegal or immoral orders
when serving in the occupied territories.
   Elisha Shapira, a reserve lieutenant colonel and head of the
Kibbutz Artzi movement, a group of 84 collective farms, said there
has been an increase in incidents in which soldiers are ordered to
beat Palestinians until their limbs break or commit other excessive
acts.
   ``The fact is that in the field many irregular incidents are
going on and soldiers are carrying out dozens and dozens of illegal
orders,'' said Shapira, who did his reserve duty near the West Bank
town of Nablus earlier this year.
   ``The army's high command is making great efforts to protect our
society's norms, but to my sorrow we are seeing many deviations,''
he said.
   Shapira said he learned of the excesses from his own reserve
service and reports from members of the Kibbutz Artzi movement. The
movement has 40,000 members.
   Traditionally, Israel's collective farms have produced a
disproportionate number of combat soldiers and pilots, including
several chiefs of staff.
   The call to disregard illegal orders, first made on Israel
television Monday, follows Defense Minister Yizhak Rabin's
announcement that new orders were being issued to soldiers,
loosening restrictions on when soldiers can use live ammunition.
   Soldiers will now be allowed to use live rounds, day or night,
against any masked suspect who disregards orders to halt. In the
past, only plastic bullets could be used and masked activists were
subject to arrest primarily at night.
   Shapira said the call was not directly connected to Rabin's
directive.
   In February 1988, Rabin issued an order saying soldiers should
use ``force, power and blows'' to quell Palestinian violence, as an
alternative to gunfire.
   The order was widely interpreted to mean soldiers could beat
Palestinian suspects as punishment, and Arab hospitals reported
treating hundreds of broken bones. Orders were later clarified to
say soldiers could only use sufficient force to arrest suspects.
   An army spokesman, asked about Shapira's accusation, said
soldiers under the pressures of dealing with violent protests
sometimes had difficulty in discerning legal from illegal actions.
   ``The problem is, it is not defined in any book. Even the
government has debated whether it is legal to order soldiers to beat
Arab suspects,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be identified by
name under military regulations.
   At least 557 Palestinians have been killed and thousands more
injured during the nearly 21-month intefadeh, or Palestinian
uprising. Most have died as a result of gunshot wounds although some
deaths have been attributed to beatings. Thirty-nine Israelis, also
have died in the violence.
   In May, a military court convicted four soldiers of the elite
Givati infantry brigade of brutality and sentenced them to nine
months in jail for beating a Palestinian refugee in Gaza with their
rifle butts and a broomstick. The Arab died of later beatings he
received from other soldiers, the court said.
   In that case the soldiers said they were following orders and
could not tell if the orders were illegal or not.
   Brig. Gen. Ehud Gross, the army's chief education officer, was
quoted as saying earlier this year that illegal use of force was
widespread because troops hesitated to report on the questionable
acts of their collegues.

   A diplomatic standoff delaying an
exodus of thousands of East German refugees from Hungary has left
the would-be emigres in the cold and West German relief workers in
the dark.
   In Hungary, at least 30 of the thousands of East Germans huddling
in refugee camps in and near Budapest said they will begin a hunger
strike on Friday if their crisis is not solved by then.
   ``The situation is desperate,'' a 23-year-old East German
identifying himself only as Rene told reporters outside the
capital's largest refugee camp, known as Csilleberc.
   Hungarian officials said they stalled a mass emigration of East
Germans to West Germany because of concern that East Berlin might
react angrily to the unauthorized release of its citizens.
   The Hamburg-based weekly magazine Stern quoted Hungarian Interior
Minister Istvan Horvath as saying resolution of the refugee crisis
could take up to 1{ months, or until West Germany and East Germany
reach agreement.
   The East German state-run news agency ADN reported Horvath's
remarks and also quoted East German Foreign Ministry spokesman
Wolfgang Meyer as repeating assurances that would-be emigres will
not face prosecution if they return.
   As recently as Sunday, West German and Hungarian officials had
suggested the departure was imminent of at least 4,700 East Germans
staying in tents and summer cabins at five makeshift refugee camps
in Hungary.
   East German refugees began fleeing to the West through Hungary
after the liberal Communist regime in Budapest in May removed barbed
wire and other obstacles from its frontier with Austria.
   An estimated 6,000 East Germans have since fled to Austria. Their
final destination is West Germany, which gives them automatic
citizenship and generous help in starting new lives.
   West German relief workers who toiled round-the-clock over the
weekend to ready tent cities for the refugees in five border towns
said Monday they still assumed arrivals were imminent.
   ``We still expect the first refugees within the next few days,''
said Bruno Merck, president of the Bavarian Red Cross Society.
   He spoke while touring the Tiefenbach camp, nestled between an
alfalfa field and broad-roofed Bavarian farmhouses.
   ``We were informed just today that the movement would start no
earlier than tomorrow, and that it could be later, but the fact of
the matter is that none of us really knows,'' Merck said.
   West German, Austrian and Hungarian officials had said last week
that the unprecedented release of East Germans to the West could
begin as early as last weekend.
   Huge encampments of 10-person tents, feeding stations, first-aid
shelters and job-finding bureaus were thrown together to help East
Germans en route to new lives in the West.
   The tent cities, in which refugees were to spend their first
nights, are worked into the patchwork of cornfields, forest and
pasture along a nearly 125-mile stretch of rolling Bavarian farmland
along the Danube and Inn rivers.
   ``We were told we were to have the reception camps ready by
Sunday night, and we worked through the night and driving rain
storms to meet that obligation,'' said Wolfgang Schmidt, director of
the Red Cross camp in Vilshofen, across the Danube from Austria.
   Asked why he thought the action had been delayed, he said,
``That's a good question. But no one here can answer it.''
   In Budapest, a Hungarian official said the transfer of refugees
was stalled because of fears over how Hungary's role would be viewed
by allied East Germany.
   Permission to emigrate is difficult for East Germans of working
age to obtain, while travel visas to Hungary are relatively easy to
get.
   Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth estimated last month that as many
as 20,000 other East Germans traveling in Hungary may seek passage
to West Germany. Bonn expects more than 100,000 East Germans to
arrive after illegal escapes by the end of the year.
   About 4,700 East Germans have formally registered with the
Hungarians for the westward exodus and are huddled in Red Cross tent
villages in Hungary awaiting transfer to West Germany.
   Many arrived in Hungary weeks ago with only light summer clothing.
   Unseasonable cold has dropped temperatures to near freezing at
night in both Hungary and at the Bavarian border camps.
   ``We now have to reckon with a lot of these people arriving with
weather-related illnesses,'' said a nurse stocking a medical tent in
Tiefenbach.
   Red Cross administrators said the influx of East Germans would be
easier if it began soon and was carried out in stages, rather than
transporting thousands at once.

   An inmate who was brought a jailhouse meal
from McDonald's peeled an ``instant winner'' game piece from a
medium Coke and won $1,000.
   ``Too bad I won't get it in time for my lawyer,'' said Charles E.
Wilson, after being told it would take up to two months to collect
the prize.
   Wilson, 33, of Brooksville, Fla., was in jail Sunday night
awaiting extradition in a few days to Carthage, Mo., to face a drug
charge when he was brought a fish sandwich, french fries and a Coke.
   ``I thought maybe I'd win a hamburger and they'd pick me up an
extra one,'' said Wilson, who was arrested Thursday night. ``I
pulled it off and said, `Do what?'''
   ``It's pretty good to be sitting in jail and win $1,000,'' he
said.
   City officials said Wilson is apparently the only inmate in the
jail to win a fast-food promotion.
   His chances of winning were 476,000-to-1, said Bob Kennedy,
assistant manager of the Conway restaurant. Kennedy said it might
take up to eight weeks to process the claim.
   Patrolman Lynn Carter said Wilson ``had a real big grin on his
face. He was just elated to say the least. He was just short of
jumping up and down.''
   Several other officers were summoned to look at the game piece.
   ``I just got sick,'' said Patrolman Bill Thessing.

<TEXT>
   A powerful car bomb jolted a bustling
Christian neighborhood today during a lull in fighting between
Christian and Syrian forces, killing two people and wounding seven,
police said.
   Also today, hundreds of Christians demonstrated at the U.S.
Embassy to protest Washington's policy in Lebanon. Organizers said
the protesters would remain there until U.S. Ambassador John
McCarthy presents his credentials to the Christian government.
   Police said a Mercedes sedan rigged with 88 pounds of explosives
blew up at 9:20 a.m. near a vegetable market in the Mokalles
district in northeast Beirut.
   A police spokesman said experts were puzzled by the blast. He
said a fuse and two anti-tank missiles in the car did not explode,
saving the area from a catastrophe. But other explosive material in
the vehicle apparently went off.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations, said a pedestrian and a man in a sedan parked near the
Mercedes were killed. All the wounded also were civilians.
   The explosion set ablaze seven vehicles, including a Lebanese
army jeep, knocked down power poles and shattered windows.
   Voice of Lebanon, the main radio station in Christian east
Beirut, at first said the blast was caused by a car bomb, then
reported that an anti-tank mine went off under a civilian car.
   By police count, 28 people were killed and 218 wounded in five
previous car bombings in Lebanon this year.
   Police said 15 people were killed, and 150 wounded when a car
bomb exploded in Beirut's Christian district of Jal el-Deeb on March
17.
   Syrian and Christian gunners skirmished with mortars across
Beirut's dividing Green Line and in mountain towns east and
northeast of the capital. Police said one person was killed and
three were wounded.
   But the exchanges were limited to the frontlines, allowing
Beirut's shrunken population to venture out to shop for food or
check on property. The Mokalles market was packed with shoppers at
the time of the blast.
   By police count, the 6-month-old confrontation betwen Gen. Michel
Aoun's 20,000 troops and Syria's 40,000-strong force has killed 827
people and wounded 2,452.
   About 1,000 Christian youths gathered along a barbed-wire
barricade at the entrance of the U.S. Embassy compound and demanded
that Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun be recognized the
country's legitimate prime minister.
   Sources at the embassy, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
McCarthy was not at the compound today.
   ``We declare the beginning of the peaceful siege of the U.S.
Embassy,'' Jubran Tueini, one of the organizers of the march, said.
   ``McCarthy go home, McCarthy go home,'' the crowd chanted.
   The latest round of fighting began March 8, two days after Aoun
imposed a blockade on illegal ports run by Syria's militia allies in
south Beirut.
   The Syrians and allied Moslem forces retaliated by shelling and
besieging the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.
Aoun then declared a ``war of liberation'' against the Syrian army
in Lebanon.
   Damascus moved troops into Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, is competing
for legitimacy with Aoun's three-man Christian cabinet. McCarthy,
who took up his post in Septembar 1988, has not submitted his
credentials to either cabinet.
   Tueini said the siege would continue until McCarthy ``submits his
credentials to the legitimate Lebanese authorities represented by
Gen. Aoun.''
   Tueini, publisher of the weekly An-Nahar Arab Internationa, said
initially that U.S. Embassy staff will be allowed to move in an out
of the compound. But if the demands of his group were not met
``we'll increase the dose'' of the siege.
   Aoun has complained about what he said was U.S. ``indifference''
and ``tacit support'' of Syria in its war against his army.
   The United States, a traditional backer of the pro-Western
Christians, has avoided taking sides in the latest confrontation,
calling repeatedly for a cease-fire but making no accusations.
   Tueini called on Washington to dispatch an official envoy to
Lebanon ``like the Soviets and French.'' French and Soviet envoys
visited Lebanon, Syria and other Arab countries last week to discuss
proposals for a settlement of Lebanon's 14-year civil war.

   The city of Miami donated 22 surplus vehicles to
Haiti's military government after U.S. aid was suspended,
infuriating some Haitian exiles.
   ``For us, that was a slap in the face,'' said Jacques Despinosse,
president of the Haitian American Democratic Club.
   Late last year the city sent vehicles that included a front-end
loader with backhoe, five dump trucks and 10 garbage packers to
Haiti. The equipment was worth $114,800 used but would cost more
than $1 million new, officials said.
   The shipment went unnoticed by Haitian exile leaders until they
heard government officials had fought over the equipment in
Port-au-Prince.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez said in retrospect, city officials should
have consulted with Haitian exile leaders.
   The Miami Herald reported on Monday that a Haitian exile
businessman had suggested to City Commissioner Miller Dawkins that
officials do something to clean up Haiti's streets. Dawkins brought
up the idea in November. After visiting Haiti, he proposed shipping
the equipment to Haiti and won approval.
   Haiti changed military leaders when Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril
overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in September. U.S. direct aid to the
Haitian government was suspended after November 1987 elections were
canceled by violence.
   Haiti's consul general in Miami, Antonio Jean-Poix, defended the
shipment as a humanitarian gesture.

<HEAD>New Canton Drug Law Sparks Criticism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union says it
will watch closely when the city make any arrests under a new
ordinance that, among other things, makes it illegal to be in a park
where drugs are sold.
   ``It's just too broad,'' said Elinor Alger, legal director of the
Ohio ACLU. ``I know it's getting after crack houses. But I think it
puts enormous responsibility on individuals who may be engaged in
innocent activity.''
   Last week the City Council approved the ordinance after Mayor Sam
Purses called for police to ``bump right up against the line''
between legal and illegal methods in the pursuit of drug dealers.
   The ordinance forbids people to ``enter, visit or remain in or
about any place or premises ... including but not limited to rooms,
apartments, buildings, motor vehicles, yards or parks where (illegal
drugs) are manufactured, sold, dispensed, furnished, given away,
stored or used with knowledge that such activity is occurring or
being reckless in that regard.''
   ``They might as well shut the parks down,'' said Harvey Gittler,
executive director of the ACLU's Ohio chapter.
   ``Theoretically, I couldn't go into a public park if I knew
another person in the park because that person might be selling
drugs and that would make me subject to arrest.''
   Ms. Alger said the ACLU will investigate any arrest that seems to
violate constitutional rights. As of Monday, there had been no
arrests under the law, police said.
   City Law Director Tom Bernabei said the city is re-examining the
ordinance's language. ``If it needs to be tightened up we will do
so. We don't want to pass an unconstitutional law, '' he said.
   ``But we have a problem in Canton with drugs,'' Bernabei said.
``We also want to be creative in the laws that we adopt in pushing
the edge of what is or what may be constitutionally prohibited.''
   In June, several gunshots were fired into the house of a city
councilman who has campaigned against drugs and gangs, which he and
others say have moved into Canton from Los Angeles, Detroit,
Baltimore and Jamaica.
   No one was injured.

   Sadie Miles looked through her living
room window and pointed out the boarded-up crack house across the
street and the blatant drug deals occurring outside in the afternoon.
   ``This isn't supposed to happen in Kalamazoo,'' she said with a
sigh as she reminisced about life when she moved to the northside
neighborhood with her parents in 1962.
   But residents of this southwestern Michigan city are learning
firsthand that no place is immune to the drug epidemic.
   Six drug-related homicides since April are among dozens of
shootings in Miles' neighborhood this year. On Aug. 23, a masked
gunman demanding cash and crack fired randomly into two separate
crowds, wounding six, including an 18-year-old pregnant woman whose
fetus did not survive.
   ``It's like someone took the worst place in Detroit and dropped
it here. The only difference is that this place is so small, the
problem affects everybody,'' said one former crack addict at Safe
House, a neighborhood recovery center.
   Authorities believe Kalamazoo's location between Detroit and
Chicago on Interstate 94 has played a large role in the escalating
problem. Because Detroit is saturated with crack, a dealer in
Kalamazoo can charge three or four times as much for that highly
addictive form of cocaine.
   Police are fighting back with some get-tough approaches that many
residents applaud but civil libertarians find troublesome.
   A new law that has resulted in about 50 arrests since May makes
it illegal to loiter in any house, vacant lot, or other place where
drugs or drug paraphernalia are sold, used or stashed.
   About 85 percent of those arrested under the ordinance have been
charged with more serious drug offenses.
   The law, adopted in various forms in several other cities, has
been criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union on grounds
that it violates the right to freedom of association. A Kalamazoo
judge upheld the law in July.
   ``People here are so fed up with the shootings, the deaths, they
are willing to accept almost anything _ constitutional or
unconstitutional _ to bring about relief,'' said Tilman Cothran,
president of the local chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   Many residents want even tougher enforcement of the law by police.
   ``The ones who are calling all of this unconstitutional don't
live here,'' said the Rev. Otha Gilyard, pastor of Mount Zion
Baptist Church and president of the Northside Association for
Community Development. ``This is a crisis situation. This is war.''
   Police also plan to target the assets of suspected drug dealers _
even if they don't have enough evidence for criminal charges.
   ``If we believe you're involved in drug trafficking, ... and we
see you're living a lifestyle that would be higher than what you'd
have legitimate income for, we're going to seize your assets and
you'll have to prove how you came across them legally,'' said Capt.
Scott Dolfman, who heads the Public Saftey Department's Special
Investigations Unit.
   In Canton, Ohio, the American Civil Liberties Union has said it
will watch closely when the city make any arrests under a new
ordinance that, among other things, makes it illegal to be in a park
where drugs are sold.
   ``I know it's getting after crack houses. But I think it puts
enormous responsibility on individuals who may be engaged in
innocent activity,'' said Elinor Alger, legal director of the Ohio
ACLU.
   Canton's City Council approved the ordinance last week after
Mayor Sam Purses called for police to ``bump right up against the
line'' between legal and illegal methods in the pursuit of drug
dealers.
   In Kalamazoo, assets seized from suspected pushers will go
directly into the 3-month-old Drug Asset Seizures and Forfeiture
Unit.
   Civil libertarians object to the plan.
   ``Assuming someone is guilty and taking their property until they
are proven innocent sure doesn't sound like the United States,''
said John Powell, ACLU national legal director.
   ``This shows the community _ like the rest of the country _ is
frustrated with drugs and is desperate. But it's important that the
first casualty of this fight against drugs not be the Bill of
Rights, the Constitution, our democratic society.''
   Despite these efforts, the police seem to be losing the war.
   ``Drug trafficking is worse now than it's ever been, and it's
going to get worse,'' said Dolfman, who added that the problem is
caused in part by a lack of space in county jails.
   Some residents refuse to accept such dismal predictions.
   ``I've seen plenty of people move away, but I've made up my mind
to stay,'' said Miles, whose well-maintained home stands in contrast
with the weed-choked lots and dilapidated houses on her street.
``Why should I leave? I want the problem to leave.''

<HEAD>Former Lawmaker, Nine Killed In Sinhalese Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gunman walked into the office of a
former lawmaker today and fatally shot him while four accomplices
stood guard outside, military officials said.
   The killing of Merril Wijeyesena Kariyawasam, chairman of the
state-owned Rubber Research Institute, was blamed on anti-government
radicals of the People's Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese
group trying to overthrow the government.
   Kariyawasam's bodyguard was injured in the attack in Ratmalana
town, 10 miles south of Colombo, said the officials, who cannot be
indentified under briefing rules.
   Kariyawasam was a senior official of the governing United
National Party's trade union, the National Workers Union. He had
represented the Agalawatte constituency in southern Sri Lanka in
Parliament.
   The military officials said nine more deaths were reported during
a 24-hour period ending today in ethnic violence inspired by the
militants. The victims included three radicals who were shot and
killed by security forces, the officials said. They gave no details.
   Six bodies were found today in different parts of the country,
the official said. He accused Sinhalese militants of the killings.
   The government says more than 5,000 people have died in the
front's 2-year-old campaign to topple the government.
   The radicals are protesting concessions made in a July 1987
accord with the minority Tamils, who are demanding a separate nation
in the northeast.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
the Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population.
   A senior military official said today that the Sinhalese front
had built up an army of about 7,500 men and armed them with
sophisticated weapons. The militia is supported by 2,000 activists,
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Defense officials had earlier estimated that the front had 2,500
hard-line members.
   Sri Lanka's security forces comprises about 103,000 members,
including 50,000 in the army, 7,000 in the navy, 4,000 in the air
force and 42,000 policemen.

<HEAD>Cash Those Checks Within a Year, Government Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department today warned people
holding millions of U.S. government checks that effective Oct. 1
they will have only one year in which to cash them. After that, they
will have to seek a replacement.
   Commissioner W.E. Douglas of the department's Financial
Management Service said the public now holds about 6 million
uncashed government checks worth more than $2.5 billion that are
more than a year old.
   The service said the checks range in value from two cents for a
1945 income tax refund to a $8,606 compensation check dated April 9,
1954. The oldest uncashed check, it said, is one dated April 15,
1919 for $1.01 in interest on a World War I Liberty Bond.
   Currently, there is no time limit for cashing the checks. But a
new law that goes into effect Oct. 1 requires checks to be cashed
within one year of issue.
   Although the new law sets a time limit on cashing a check, it
does not affect entitlement to payment, the service said. People
holding expired checks will have to contact the government agency
writing the check for a replacement.
   The law also provides that government checks isssued before Oct.
1 will have to be cashed no later than Sept. 30, 1990.

   The figure surpassed the 1988 record by slightly more than $1
million.
   Corporate sponsors donated an additional $36,228,846 during the
21{-hour event that ended Monday afternoon, drawing an estimated 100
million TV viewers.
   The donations soared to a record shortly after Bob Sampson, an
airline executive crippled by muscular dystrophy, appeared in the
final hour.
   ``No telethon for my kids will ever be anything without him,''
Lewis said in introducing Sampson, who contracted MD as a teen-ager
during the Depression and first appeared on the telethon in 1967.
   Sampson, who has lost two of his six grandchildren to muscular
dystrophy, told Lewis last week he couldn't return to the telethon
this year because of the emotional toll.
   ``You can't turn your back on your grandchildren or these kids,''
Lewis told him.
   ``I told him he's living on borrowed time; I'm living on borrowed
time,'' Lewis said of his plea to get Sampson to return for another
show. ``I said while we're here, let's do some good stuff.''
   On television, Sampson hailed the advances made against muscular
dystrophy, but said much needs to be done.
   ``There's been enough of this disease killing children and
devastating families,'' the United Airlines executive said, drawing
a standing ovation from the 2,000 people in the Jerry Lewis Theater.
   Lewis opened the show Sunday by saying that inroads had been made
against 40 neuromuscular diseases that the Muscular Dystrophy
Association is involved in fighting.
   The telethons have raised $526,524,210 for the New York
City-based association since Lewis began the annual event in 1966.
Corporate contributions, which have amounted to hundreds of millions
of dollars, are not included in the telethon totals.
   As in previous years, it was the victims and their families who
provided the most touching moments.
   Lewis was moved to tears when former high school football coach
Charlie Wedemeyer, the subject of the television movie ``Quiet
Victory,'' told the audience: ``You never know which dollar it will
be to make the difference and win the fight.''
   Wedemeyer, of Los Gatos, Calif., is paralyzed by amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. He
conveyed his message through his wife, Lucy, who read his lips.
   ``So often I feel I am a prisoner in my own body that has been
given a life sentence,'' Wedemeyer said. ``But I have chosen, with
God's help, to turn this disadvantage into an advantage.''
   He told of traveling the country, telling his message to
colleges, schools and religious groups.
   ``God really has a sense of humor to send someone on a speaking
tour who can't even speak,'' Wedemeyer said.
   He urged the audience to ``open your hearts to make a difference
in the life of one disabled person, even if it's only a wink or a
smile as you pass by.''
   Also appearing was Sheri Waters, whose husband, former San
Francisco 49er quarterback Bob Waters, died in May at age 50 after a
long battle against ALS.
   ``What happened to our family can happen to yours, and it changes
your life,'' she said.
   This year, more than 50 top-name entertainers were featured,
including Tony Orlando, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Sammy Davis
Jr., Billy Crystal, the group Alabama, The Oak Ridge Boys, Jack
Jones, Robert Goulet, the McGuire Sisters, LaToya Jackson, Ringo
Starr, Waylon Jennings and Maureen McGovern.

   Former Democratic Whip Tony Coelho left
Congress under a cloud of ethical questions, but no candidate in the
campaign for his seat has bad words about him.
   Abortion, highway congestion, agriculture problems, Middle East
hostages and the candidates' experience seem to be getting more
attention than congressional ethics and Coelho's departure from the
House.
   Instead of keeping his distance, the lone Democrat in the race,
Assemblyman Gary Condit, has used TV ads and mailings that stress
his ties to Coelho.
   ``What's happened is that both sides have done polling. I am very
positive in the district. They decided it would backfire if they
took me on,'' said Coelho, who had held the seat since 1978.
   The special election is on Sept. 12. Under California's rules,
all candidates will appear on the same ballot. If no one gets more
than 50 percent, the top finisher of each party will take part in a
runoff Nov. 7.
   Coelho resigned on June 15, his 47th birthday, after failing to
report a $50,000 loan from a savings and loan. The money was used
for a junk bond deal set up by the firm's chief executive officer.
   The race to succeed Coelho is the fourth congressional contest
this year. Democrats have won two. Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
last week won the Florida seat held for 27 years by Democrat Claude
Pepper, who died May 30.
   Elections will also be held to fill House seats that belonged to
Speaker Jim Wright, who resigned while under an ethics
investigation, and Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and Larkin Smith,
R-Miss., who died in plane crashes.
   In the California race, a couple of GOP candidates say
congressional ethics is an issue. But the leading Republican, former
state agriculture director Clare Berryhill, says the subject hasn't
caught on with voters.
   ``You'd think it would be an issue ... (but) the local people
don't seem to be that upset,'' Berryhill said. ``When he came back,
they almost welcomed him like a hero. That's why I am saying,
people, they talk about ethics ... but do they really care?''
   Coelho said there was nothing improper about the $50,000 loan and
that it wasn't disclosed because of a clerical error.
   His political problems coincided with the Wright's downfall,
magnifying them and for a time giving Republicans two prominent
targets, something Coelho said he wanted to avoid.
   Coelho's former district and its predecessors have been in
Democratic hands since B.F. Sisk, Coelho's former boss, won the seat
in 1954. Coelho captured the district in 1978 when Sisk retired, and
rose through the ranks to become whip, the No. 3 post in the House
Democratic hierarchy.
   The district stretches through the heart of the San Joaquin
Valley farm belt, then juts east into the Sierra Nevada to take in a
portion of Yosemite National Park.
   Democrats make up about 55 percent of the district's voters. But
the area tends to be conservative on many issues and Berryhill sees
a tight race.
   ``I think it's going to be like every race I have been in. I
think it's going to go down to the wire,'' Berryhill said.
   Condit, a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who has spent 6{
years in the state Assembly, probably is best known in California as
a member of the Gang of Five _ rebel Democrats who tried
unsuccessfully to topple Speaker Willie Brown last year.
   Eight candidates will be on the ballot: Condit, six Republicans
and Roy Shimp, a Libertarian. Two Republicans discontinued
campaigning after Berryhill was endorsed by state and local party
leaders.
   The other GOP candidates are Cliff Burris, a contractor who
stresses ``family values;'' Robert Weimer, a farmer and farm
equipment manufacturer; and Dave Williams, a food packaging engineer.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
arrived in West Germany today and called for East and West to
overcome economic and political barriers, creating a Europe ``where
everyone feels that they are free.''
   Walesa spoke upon arrival at Duesseldorf airport at the start of
a five-day visit to West Germany.
   He is expected to lobby for Western aid to help promote Polish
reform under the new government of Solidarity activist Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, who was named last month as the East bloc's first
non-Communist government leader.
   In his remarks today, Walesa called for a strong and united
Europe, ``a Europe in which there is a place for everybody and where
everyone feels that they are free.
   ``We have the chance to work together fruitfully. From the
airplane, I saw that we are indeed a united Europe, but it is hilly
here and there, and there are also other obstacles,'' Walesa told
reporters through an interpreter.
   ``I believe that these hills, obstacles and walls can be
removed,'' he said. ``We must above all think about humanity. We
must above all consider that no one can be allowed to dominate
another. We must think about the past when many people suffered
losses _ we too.''
   ``We have thought about many of these losses for 50 long years
now. That cannot be repeated,'' Walesa said.
   Poland and West Germany are still struggling for reconciliation
50 years after World War II began with Nazi Germany's attack on
Poland.
   Since the war, however, West Germany has built strong business
ties with Eastern Europe. The United States has suggested Bonn take
the lead in the West's efforts to support East bloc reform.
   During his West German stay, Walesa is to meet with high-ranking
government officials including Chancellor Helmut Kohl; the
Duesseldorf-based German Labor Federation; and Ruhr Valley steel
workers and industrialists.
   ``The chancellor and Lech Walesa on Thursday will be discussing
the situation in Poland following the government changeover,
economic conditions there, international aid measures for Poland,
and the future cooperation between our two countries,'' Kohl's chief
spokesman, Hans Klein, told reporters Monday.
   Kohl has pledged West German aid for Poland, but the two sides
have been unable to agree on how much.
   Differences between the two countries spoiled Kohl's hopes of
traveling to Poland as a symbolic gesture of goodwill marking the
50th anniversary of the start of the war.
   Relations between Europe's two largest countries have also been
strained by recent suggestions of West Germany's conservative
finance minister, Theo Waigel, that Polish lands once part of the
German empire technically still belong to Germany.

<HEAD>U.S. Rejects Aid Request For Refugees, Gov't Uses Choppers to Track
Arabs</HEAD>

   The United States and other nations rejected an
Israeli request for aid to rehabilitate Palestinian refugee camps
because of lack of progress on peace efforts, the government said
today.
   Also today, Israel media said the government has begun using
helicopters to track down wanted Palestinians in remote villages and
mountain hideouts in the occupied West Bank.
   In a letter this week to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, President
Bush turned down an Israeli request for aid to rehabilitate refugee
camps in the occupied territories, said Shamir spokesman Yossi
Ahimeir.
   He said the United States, Japan, Canada and European nations all
rejected the request and said any additional refugee assistance
depends on further progress in stalemated peace efforts.
   Bush's letter came in response to Shamir's request about two
months ago for the United States to take a leading role in aiding
rehabilitation of the camps, Ahimeir said.
   ``We consider the refugee problem to be a very important human
problem,'' Ahimier said on Israel radio. ``Resolving it could help
advance the entire peace initiative.''
   The issue arose as Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanayahu of
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc headed to Washington to drum up more
American help for peace efforts and to argue against PLO chief
Yasser Arafat receiving a U.S. visa to address the United Nations.
   Netanyahu blamed the Palestinians for holding up the peace
process, saying slayings of 107 residents in the territories by
fellow Arabs were aimed at blocking agreement to Israel's peace
intiative. Most of those killed were accused of collaborating with
Israeli authorities.
   Maariv quoted Bush as saying in his letter to Shamir that the
refugee camps had to be part of a ``comprehensive plan to resolve
the conflict'' between Israel and Arab states.
   Bush also reportedly reminded Shamir that the United States
already plays a prominent role in aiding the refugees by
contributing to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which administers
the refugee camps.
   The United States is the U.N. agency's top contributor, and
donated more than $60 million of its $223 million budget his year,
agency officials said. According to the agency, 844,708 Palestinian
refugees live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Resolving the refugee problem is part of Israel's four-point
peace plan. The ramshackle camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
have been key trouble spots since Israel occupied these lands during
the 1967 Middle East War.
   The camps also have been at the center of the 20-month uprising
against the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The central
point of Israel peace initiative is elections in the occupied
territories to chose Palestinian representatives to negotiate with
Israel on interim autonomy for the territories, with their final
status to be settled later.
   After criticism of the elections proposal by the PLO and other
Palestinians, Israeli officials called for a worldwide program to
improve conditions in the camps.
   Also today, Israel radio said the army is using helicopters to
track down wanted Palestinians in remote villages and mountain
hideouts in the occupied West Bank.
   An army spokesman said the military has used helicopters for
specific missions in the occupied territories but refused to verify
the use of the choppers was part of a new policy for arresting
leaders of the Palestinian uprising.
   In the Gaza Strip, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy died of wounds
suffered in a earlier clash with soldiers, Arab reports said. The
boy, Ahmed al-Abed el-Bittar from the town of Khan Yunis, died of a
head wound sustained in a clash with troops last week, the reports
said.
   His death raises to 558 the Palestinian death toll in the more
than 20-month uprising against Israeli occupation. Thirty-nine
Israelis have also died in the violence.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, masked Palestinian youths
stabbed to death Naeem Fakhri Afana, 27, Arab reports said. They
said Afana was suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   The army confirmed both deaths and said in Rafah one other Arab
was severely beaten.

   Here they come, Miss America hopefuls.
   For the 51 contestants coming to Atlantic City today, the next
two weeks won't be all glamour and glitz.
   With barely time to unpack, they launch into hours of rehearsals,
interviews, photograph sessions and cocktail parties.
   Jennifer Ann Landry, Miss New Hampshire, became the first
contestant to arrive when she checked in this morning with 10 pieces
of luggage. The 50 other beauty queens were to arrive throughout the
day.
   She said she got a vote of confidence from the pilot of her
commuter flight. ``He mistook me for Miss America,'' she said. Her
traveling companion, Rosamond Van Duyne, said, ``We think that's a
good omen.''
   Although preliminary competitions for the 69-year-old Miss
America Pageant do not begin until Sept. 12, the contestants will
spend the week rehearsing an elaborate television production, said
pageant director Leonard Horn.
   This year, each contestant was required to submit an essay on an
issue of her choice. The winner will be able to promote that issue
during her yearlong reign.
   Traditionally, Miss America travels the country on behalf of
pageant sponsors. But giving Miss America a voice on her own issue
will only enhance her status, Horn said.
   ``It is not a beauty pageant, and it is not just a scholarship
pageant,'' he said. ``This program fosters personal growth and
achievement, and scholarship is not an end in itself, it's a means
to an end.''
   A panel of preliminary judges will choose the top 10 finalists. A
celebrity panel of judges will choose the new Miss America on the
final night _ Sept. 16.
   This year's celebrity judges are developer Donald Trump,
entertainer Merv Griffin, psychologist Joyce Brothers, actresses
Phylicia Rashad and Debbie Allen, baseball great Mike Schmidt and
journalist Claudia Cohen.
   Gary Collins will be host of the pageant for the eighth year and
Miss America 1971 Phyllis George Brown will be co-host.
   The theme of this year's pageant, televised by NBC-TV, is ``A
Moment in Time.''
   The new Miss America will succeed Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson of
Minnesota. The winner receives a $35,000 scholarship and fees from
personal appearances during her reign.

   Stung by allegations that concerts sponsored by
beer companies encourage minors to drink, the nation's biggest
brewer said it will donate $250,000 to Students Against Driving
Drunk in Texas.
   The money will help provide SADD chapter start-up kits to all
Texas junior and senior high schools, Stephen J. Burrows,
Anheuser-Busch vice president for consumer awareness and education,
said Monday.
   Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing Co. were criticized for
sponsoring large outdoor music festivals in seven Texas cities over
Labor Day weekend.
   Both brewers took precautions to prevent underage drinking and
the events, which drew 500,000 people, were without major problems,
police said.
   SADD, founded in 1981, is a student-run organization that uses
peer pressure to discourage alcohol and drug use. It has 4 million

<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels destroyed part of a
government air base in western Afghanistan and inflicted heavy
losses on a convoy trying to reach the city of Kandahar, Western
diplomats and guerrilla sources said today.
   Omar Sheradan, a spokesman for the Jamiat-i-Islami rebel group,
said a guerrilla rocket attack destroyed about half the air base at
Shindand during an attack last week.
   He said the guerrilla faction's field commander, Ismail Khan, led
an estimated 500 rebel fighters in the attack on the air base and a
ring of security posts.
   Rebels said they overran 12 government positions protecting the
base, killing 160 soldiers and destroying two helicopter gunships
and two MiG fighter bombers.
   Rebels also claimed they destroyed 80 of an estimated 950
vehicles in a government convoy that had reportedly originated at
Torghundi, near the Soviet border, and was trying to reach the city
of Kandahar 350 miles to the northwest, Western diplomats said.
   Sheradon confirmed the attack and said 150 Communist troops died
in the fighting. There was no date of the attack or report of rebel
casualties.
   Diplomats, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity, said the
attack on Shindand airbase crippled air cover for the massive convoy.
   ``The ability of regime forces to protect the convoy may be
impeded over the next several days because of a major resistance
rocket attack on Shndand air base,'' said a diplomatic report.
   Sheradon said the base was closed.
   Afghanistan's second-largest city of Kandahar is located in the
south, about 270 miles south of the Afghan capital, Kabul. Rebel
sources said in recent months Kandahar had been resupplied almost
exclusively by air.
   U.S.-backed guerrillas have been fighting for more than a decade
to topple the Communist government. On Feb. 15, the last of an
estimated 110,000 Soviet soldiers, who had been fighting along side
their Afghan allies for nine years, left Afghanistan.
   As the summer fighting season draws to a close, rebels have
stepped up their attacks on Communist positions throughout the
country.
   Heavy fighting is reported around the Communist garrison town of
Khost in eastern Afghanistan, 10 miles from the Pakistan border.
   A rebel victory at Khost would open a direct rebel supply link
from Pakistan to fighters in northern and western Afghanistan, rebel
sources said.
   Rebel rockets have pounded the airport at Kabul, causing some of
the heaviest casualties in recent months. Sixteen people were killed
and another 52 were injured when a barrage of rockets battered the
airport on Saturday.

   Sibila pried off the grating from his 10th-floor window Monday

short and Sibila fell to the landing, hit his head and was

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for John Demjanjuk said he had new
evidence to show his client is not a Nazi war criminal and asked the
Supreme Court today to postpone an appeal hearing on his conviction
and death sentence.
   The evidence includes at least four documents recovered from a
garbage pail at the Justice Department in Washington that contradict
key testimony given against Demjanjuk at his trial, laywer Yoram
Sheftel said in a telephone interview.
   Demjanjuk, 69, a retired Ohio autoworker, was found guilty by an
Israeli court in April 1988 of crimes against humanity and crimes
against the Jewish people. He was sentenced to death.
   He was identified by witnesses as a sadistic guard known as
``Ivan the Terrible'' at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied
Poland, where 850,000 Jews perished in 1942-1943.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk has claimed to be a victim of
mistaken identity. He appealed the verdict on June 30, 1988, and
after several postponements the appeal was scheduled to be heard
starting Nov. 1.
   In two petitions filed today, Sheftel asked for a delay of
Demjanjuk's appeal hearing for at least six months, citing documents
found several weeks ago at the Justice Department's Office of
Special Investigations, which probes suspected Nazi war criminals.
   Sheftel said that in one document, a key witness against
Demjanjuk, former Nazi prison guard Otto Horn, is said to have
failed to identify him in a photo line-up, contradicting claims in
court that Horn recognized Demjanjuk.
   He accused the Justice Department of ``concealing important
evidence on the one hand and falsifying other evidence'' in
proceedings which stripped his client of U.S. citizenship in 1981,
paving the war for his extradition to Israel five years later.
   ``We have reports there are other (Justice Department) documents
like these, which they have hidden until now,'' Sheftel said, adding
that the case was already under investigation in Washington.
   Among the witnesses who identified Demjanjuk as the notorious
guard Ivan were several Treblinka survivors who gave emotional
testimony at his trial.
   Demjanjuk's attorneys failed in their attempts to persuade the
court that too much time had elapsed since the war for positive
identification and that their client was a prisoner of war during
the period in question.

   The Rev. Richard W. Dortch, who is
expected to testify against Jim Bakker at the TV evangelist's fraud
trial, is out of the hospital after a five-day stay for an
undisclosed ailment.
   Attorney George Tragos said Dortch, 57, was released Monday from
Morton Plant Hospital. He said the family asked that Dortch's
condition remain confidential.
   ``But I'm sure that if the government requires, he will
testify,'' Tragos added.
   The former PTL vice president was sentenced Aug. 24 to eight
years in prison and fined $200,000 after pleading guilty to fraud at
the evangelical empire Bakker built. Dortch agreed to testify
against Bakker.
   A federal judge in North Carolina suspended Bakker's trial
Thursday and committed him to a federal mental ward for psychiatric
evaluation after a psychiatrist reported Bakker was hallucinating
and cowering under a couch.
   It is not known when the trial will resume.

forces in Europe, a U.S. official said today.
   Security checks have begun on Woolsey, a lawyer who apparently
owes his nomination over two other candidates to his close ties to
Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The two other candidates were Stephen Ledogar, a foreign service
officer who now holds the job, and Phil Karber, vice president of
the BDM Corp. who evidently had the backing of Vice President Dan
Quayle.
   News of Woolsey's likely selection was first reported in today's
editions of The Washington Times.
   The negotiations resume Thursday in Geneva between the 16-nation
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the seven-nation Warsaw Pact
led by the Soviet Union.
   Bush has raised expectations of an accord by the end of the year,
but that now appears only a long-shot possibility.
   Woolsey, whose nomination would require Senate approval, would
bring to the job a reputation for political skill as well as weapons
expertise. As a conservative Democrat he has close ties with Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, while retaining the trust of defense-minded Republicans.
   Woolsey, 48, was undersecretary of the Navy in the Carter
administration and has served on the staffs of the National Security
Council and the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   As an outside adviser to the Reagan administration, Woolsey
joined with Scowcroft in recommending development of the Midgetman
missile, a mobile, single-warhead weapon.
   Bush in April decided to proceed with a plan to buy and deploy
300 to 500 new Midgetman missiles to be carried on trucks and also
proposed that 50 MX missiles now housed in fixed, underground silos
be pulled out and put on rail cars.
   Cost of the two programs, if Congress provides the funds, could
exceed $40 billion.
   The negotiations in Geneva, known formally as the Conventional
Force Reduction Talks, are designed to produce a treaty setting
equal ceilings on NATO and Warsaw Pact tanks, artillery, armored
troop carriers, aircraft, helicopters and possibly manpower.
   Bush said in June he wanted to complete the agreement within six
months to a year, but the two alliances have not yet agreed on a
number of basic issues, including measures to verify an agreement
would be kept.
   The nomination of Woolsey initially had been expected last
spring, but then was delayed while consideration was given also to
Karber and to retaining Ledogar.

<DATELINE>MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five U.S. military helicopters arrived
today in Colombia to bolster the government's anti-drug security
forces after another night of bombings in Medellin, the world's main
cocaine-producing center.
   The U.S. Embassy confirmed the landing in Bogota of the UH-1H
helicopters, which Colombia presumably will use in raids on remote
coca-leaf fields and clandestine cocaine-processing labs.
   President Bush has given Colombia $65 million in emergency
military aid for anti-narcotics operations.
   Medellin police said four bombs exploded Monday night in or near
the city _ home base of the world's most powerful cocaine cartel,
injuring two people.
   Officials blamed the drug barons for an attack in which a man in
a camouflage uniform fired an automatic rifle at a line of people
waiting outside the Medellin airport terminal, killing one man and
wounding 14 people before he was fatally shot by security forces.
   ``It was horrendous. I was hit. I fell,'' said Rodolfo Montoya, a
Colombian who lives in the New York City and was hospitalized with
an ankle wound.
   Montoya, who was visiting his mother, said he and his wife had
been on their way to Bogota, 150 miles south of Medellin, for a
connecting flight to New York.
   He said his wife had just passed the security inspection at the
door and was safe inside the building when the gunman opened fire.
Among the wounded were eleven civilians and three airport security
officers.
   Investigators were checking the fingerprints of the assailant in
an effort to identify him. They said his car was towed away in case
it contained a bomb, but a search found no explosives.
   The Caracol radio network said some marijuana was found in the
vehicle.
   Airport security was increased throughout Colombia. At El Dorado
airport in Bogota, police and soldiers searched passengers and
checked bags outside the terminal.
   Two four-engine C-130 transport planes landed in Bogota Sunday
and on Monday eight A-37 reconnaissance and attack jets, formerly
stationed at Air National Guard units in Illinois and Michigan, were
turned over to Colombia at a military base in the Caribbean city of
Barranquilla.
   ``These aircraft, which will be piloted by Colombians, will
strengthen our combat capacity,'' Gen. Alfonso Amaya, commander of
the Colombian air force, said as the A-37s were delivered. The
fast-climbing, twin-engine jets can be equipped with rockets and
machine guns. Colombia already has some A-37s.
   Amaya thanked ``the government of the United States for this act
of solidarity.''
   Other U.S. equipment promised to Colombia includes trucks, small
boats, grenades, machine guns, rifles and bulletproof jackets for
judges and other officials targeted for assassination by the drug
gangs.
   Civil aviation officials in the northwestern city of Monteria
said a C-123 transport plane of the U.S. State Department's
international narcotics division was firebombed early Sunday.
   The U.S. Embassy said Monday it could not confirm the bombing but
acknowledged that the plane was badly damaged by fire.
   Colombia's government has been in a virtual war with the
country's cocaine cartels since Aug. 18, with bombings, shootings
and arson occurring almost daily. Medellin, population 2 million,
has been one of the most violent spots.
   The security check at the Medellin airport terminal door,
mandatory for airport employees as well as passengers, was designed
precisely to search for bombs and guns because of the drug conflict.
   Soldiers and policemen carrying automatic weapons continued to
patrol Medellin's streets and an 11 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew remained in
effect.
   On Monday night, two bombs were thrown at Medellin offices of the
government's Caja Agraria bank and one of the blasts slightly
injured two passersby, police said, adding that damage to the
buildings was slight.
   Two men on a motorcycle threw a firecracker-like object into a
sidewalk guardhouse in a wealthy Medellin neighborhood where three
policemen were on duty, police said. Although the device exploded,
the policemen were not seriously hurt, the local police press office
said.
   A fourth bomb exploded in the town of Itagui, just south of
Medellin. The police said the bomb was small and damage was confined
to the door of a warehouse belonging to the Banco del Occidente.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco ordered the crackdown
on drug traffickers after a string of assassinations that culminated
in the killing Aug. 18 of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading
presidential candidate and an outspoken foe of the cocaine barons.
   Using emergency powers, police and the army have arrested
thousands of people and seized more than 500 estates, office
buildings and other property, including cars, aircraft, yachts,
cattle, and racehorses.
   Some middle-level traffickers have been arrested, but the
Medellin cartel leaders remain at large. Barco revived the
extradition process so traffickers wanted in the United States could
be sent there for trial.

<HEAD>Minnesota Appeals Court: Confidentiality Promise is Enforceable Contract</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs after 8th graf pvs, `However, he ...' to UPDATE
with comment from editor and Cohen unavailable for comment.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULA FROKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A promise of confidentiality to news sources
is an oral contract, a state appeals court said today in upholding
$200,000 of a $700,000 damage award against Minnesota's two largest
newspapers.
   A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals agreed 2-1 that the
Star Tribune and the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch must share the
damages payment to public relations man Dan Cohen.
   But the panel, sitting in St. Paul, unanimously rejected Cohen's
claim of misrepresentation by the newspapers and said he is not
entitled to $500,000 in punitive damages that had been awarded by a
Hennepin County jury.
   ``News organizations cannot rely on the First Amendment to shield
themselves from criminal or civil liability simply because the acts
giving rise to such liability were taken while in pursuit of
newsworthy information,'' said the majority opinion by Judge
Marianne Short.
   ``Surely, the newspapers would not suggest they are immune to
ordinary commercial contracts for goods and services,'' Short said.
``Yet the newspapers maintain that an agreement with a news source
is exempt from the law of contracts.''
   Judge Gary Crippen wrote in a partial dissent that the entire
award should be overturned. The case, Crippen wrote, ``involves the
exercise of the coercive power of the state to punish the choice of
the private press to publish.''
   Star Tribune Executive Editor Joel R. Kramer said the paper is
pleased with the decision on punitive damages and by Crippen's
partial dissent.
   However, he added, ``We are disappointed with the court
majority's ruling that contract law applies in this case and
supersedes First Amendment protections.'' He said no decision had
been made about appealing the ruling to the state Supreme Court.
   Mark Nadler, managing editor of the St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch, said today the paper is ``pleased that all three judges
agreed with our position from the beginning that there was no fraud
involved _ that our people did what they did in good faith and that
there are no grounds for punitive damages.''
   The paper has not decided whether to appeal, he said.
   There was no answer at Cohen's home today. His attorney, Elliot
C. Rothenberg, did not immediately return a phone call.
   The case concerned a revelation during the 1982 gubernatorial
campaign that Marlene Johnson, a Democratic Farmer Labor candidate
for lieutenant governor, once had been arrested for shoplifting.
   Cohen, who worked for Independent-Republican gubernatorial
candidate Wheelock Whitney, provided the information on the
condition that he not be identified as the source. Reporters for the
newspapers gave that assurance. But their editors ordered that
Cohen's name be published because, they argued, the public had the
right to know that the information came from the Whitney campaign.
Johnson went on to win the election.
   Cohen sued, claiming he lost his advertising agency job because
the newspapers breached an oral contract.
   The Appeals Court said any First Amendment rights the newspapers
might have had to publish the source's name were waived when the
reporters made the confidentiality pledge.
   The newspapers' argument that the public had the right to
information about the source was valid but that didn't mean the
papers had to use Cohen's name, the opinion said.
   Cohen based his claim of misrepresentation in part on a legal
inference that editors never intended to keep the reporters'
promises. In addition, he said the reporters concealed the fact that
they had no authority to bind the newspapers to their promise.
   The Appeals Court said Cohen could not legally infer that the
editors didn't intend to keep the promise. The court also noted that
no witness could recall a previous instance when a reporter's
confidentiality promise was vetoed by an editor at either paper.
   ``Because it was the newspapers' practice to honor their
reporters' promises of confidentiality, the reporters did not by
omission misrepresent their authority,'' the majority said in
throwing out the punitive damages resulting from the
misrepresentation claim.

   Police arrested five British soccer fans
who rampaged through a Stockholm restaurant and started a fight with
some Swedes, national radio said Tuesday.
   Two of the fans, here for the World Cup qualifying match between
England and Sweden on Wednesday, faced charges of assault and
causing material damage, the radio said.
   The disturbance started at a restaurant late Monday, when two of
the youths caused considerable damages. Later in the evening, all
five started a fight with a group of Swedes, according to the
national news agency TT.
   Police released three of the fans after a few hours, but two were
detained until Tuesday morning for questioning and to sober up.
   Twenty British soccer fans were taken off a Sweden-bound
passenger ferry Monday, which had to return to Harwich, England,
after widespread disorder. One fan was believed drowned after having
jumped overboard during the trip.

   President Corazon Aquino on Tuesday
appointed a council to propose alternative uses for U.S. military
bases in case Manila and Washington do not renew the agreement under
which they operate in the Philippines.
   The 17 members of the Executive-Legislative Bases Council include
provincial governors, Cabinet undersecretaries, business leaders and
congressional members. The council is to convene next week.
   Congress created the council in July to study proposals on the
uses of U.S. bases in case Americans vacate them. The agreement on
the six installations, including Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay
naval base, expires in 1991, and many Filipino politicians have
called for the installations to be closed.
   U.S. and Filipino officials are expected to begin talks on a new
agreement late this year.
   Congressional leaders have proposed moving the airport and other
government buildings to Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila.
They have suggested converting the Subic Bay base into a repair
facility for commercial vessels.

   Soldiers killed one of the country's
most wanted communist rebel leaders in a raid Tuesday outside
Manila, the military said.
   Provincial military commander Col. Ramsey Ocampo said Crisostomo
Ibarra was shot to death early Tuesday when troops raided the house
of his common-law wife in Bataan province, 30 miles west of Manila.
   Ocampo said Ibarra, 37, was secretary of the Bataan Provincial
Operational Command of the rebel New People's Army. Ibarra was also
a member of the outlawed Communist Party's central committee in
Central Luzon, the military said.
   Ocampo said three comrades of the slain rebel escaped during the
attack. There were no other casualties reported.
   Ibarra joined the revolutionary movement in 1980. He surrendered
to authorities in 1981 but rejoined his comrades a few months after
escaping from military custody.
   Marxist guerrillas have been fighting the government 20 years.

<HEAD>Court Records: Broker Accused In HUD Fraud Given Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of embezzling $2 million in
federal housing funds to buy cars, jewelry and furs will be allowed
to plead guilty to reduced charges after working as a drug
informant, court records show.
   Real estate broker Cy Walker will plead guilty to one count of
embezzling from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and
one of failing to file a tax return, according to documents released
by federal prosecutors Monday.
   In 1988, an audit by HUD's inspector general said that Walker,
under contract to handle property closings in Montgomery, hid more
than $2 million, with hundreds of thousands spent on cars, a
speedboat, jewelry, furs and travel.
   Walker also served as an informant for a local-federal drug task
force investigating Freddie Hyatt, a 43-year-old horse trainer and
former football player for the St. Louis Cardinals and Washington
Redskins, the documents said.
   Hyatt was scheduled for trial today on federal cocaine
trafficking charges.
   Court and HUD records show that Walker, whose age was not
available, was as a drug informant against Hyatt at the same time
HUD auditors were alleging embezzlement by Walker.
   U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson was not immediately available for
comment today on whether federal agents were aware of Walker's HUD
activities at the time he was an informant. Calls to Wilson's office
were not immediately returned.
   The documents filed Monday were requested by Hyatt's defense to
show any government promises made to Walker in the case against
Hyatt.
   According to the HUD audit, Walker put more than $2 million in
HUD closing money from 1984 to 1987 into a bank account that he
controlled.
   Some of it apparently paid for legitimate agency expenses, but
records show Walker also wrote $180,000 in checks to car dealers.
   The audit said none of the $2 million was recovered.

<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded during the rush hour
Tuesday in a crowded Christian neighborhood of Beirut, killing two
people and wounding seven. Syrian and Christian gunners dueled
across the city's Green Line.
   Hundreds of Christian youths protested outside the U.S. Embassy
and accused the United States of supporting the Syrian role in
Lebanon.
   Police said the Mercedes-Benz rigged with about 88 pounds of TNT
went off at 9:20 a.m. in the Mokalles district at Beirut's
southeastern edge. A pedestrian and the driver of a car parked near
the Mercedes were reported killed.
   A police spokesman said the detonation fuse was found unexploded
in the car's trunk, along with two mines.
   ``We tend to believe the vehicle exploded by mistake. Maybe due
to an electrical short circuit,'' said a police spokesman, who
cannot be named in line with regulations. ``Had the mines exploded
they would have shattered the whole district.''
   The blast echoed across east Beirut. It set seven vehicles
ablaze, including an army jeep, uprooted power poles and smashed
glass in a 500-yard radius.
   Christian radio stations interrupted programming with reports on
the blast and called on motorists to avoid the area. Ambulances and
fire engines rushed to the scene to evacuate casualties and fight
the fire, which burned 40 minutes.
   Power cables dangled from shrapnel-scarred buildings that were
blackened by smoke billowing from gutted cars.
   Police and soldiers of the Christian army commander, Gen. Michel
Aoun, sealed off Mokalles to allow rescue teams through.
   It was the sixth car bombing in Lebanon this year. By police
count, the previous five killed 28 people and wounded 218.
   As ambulances evacuated victims from Mokalles, two mortar rounds
fired by Syrian gunners exploded on the eastern, Christian side of
Beirut's Green Line, sending dust billowing into the sky.
   The Syrian-Christian exchange, limited to front lines and
districts close to them, killed one person and wounded three, by
police count.
   The 6-month-old confrontation between Aoun's 20,000 mainly
Christian troops and the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in Lebanon has
killed 827 people and wounded 2,452.
   The current round of violence, one of the fiercest in the
14-year-old civil war, broke out March 8 after Aoun's forces
blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias.
   Syrian troops and allied Lebanese forces retaliated by shelling
the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, home to about 1 million
people northeast of Beirut.
   Aoun then declared a ``war of liberation'' against Syrian troops
in Lebanon, charging they betrayed a 1976 peacekeeping mandate by
siding with Moslems against Christians in the civil war.
   About 1,000 Christian youths gathered near the main entrance to
the U.S. Embassy compound in Beirut's Christian suburb of Aoukar and
accused the United States of supporting the Syrians in the war-torn
nation.
   ``We declare the beginning of the peaceful siege of the U.S.
Embassy,'' said Jubran Tueini of the Movement for Supporting the
Liberation, which sponsored the rally.
   Tueini is a member of the command council of the right-wing
Lebanese Forces, Aoun's main ally against the Syrians.
   Sources at the U.S. Embassy, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Ambassador John McCarthy was not at the mission's offices.
   ``McCarthy go home! McCarthy go home!'' the crowd chanted.
   Tueini said the protest would continue ``until McCarthy submits
his credentials to the Lebanese authorities represented by General
Aoun.''
   McCarthy arrived in Lebanon in late September 1988. He has not
submitted his credentials to avoid recognizing either of the rival
Moslem and Christian Cabinets vying for power in Lebanon.
   Minutes before his term expired Sept. 22, 1988, former President
Amin Gemayel named Aoun _ a Maronite Catholic like himself _ to head
an interim military Cabinet pending election by Parliament of a new
head of state.
   A leading newspaper in Saudi Arabia reported Tuesday that King
Fahd has postponed a trip to Washington for a second time because of
efforts involving the superpowers to end the bloodshed in Lebanon.
   The daily Al-Riyadh indicated the contacts were focusing on
reviving efforts by an Arab committee, of which Fahd is a member, to
arrange a cease-fire.
   ``It is not the United States alone which is looking forward to
Lebanon's salvation through the ... committee, but France and the
Soviet Union also hope for that, along with other international
forces,'' the newspaper said.
   The visit, originally planned for July, was rescheduled for Sept.
14 but put off again.

<HEAD>Pollution Tops Agenda in Dutch Elections</HEAD>
<HEAD>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The poor quality of the air they
breath and the water they drink will be one of the major concerns of
Dutch voters when they choose a new government Wednesday.
   Premier Ruud Lubbers, the nation's charismatic and highly popular
leader since 1982, is likely to retain his post. But pre-election
polls indicate he may need to turn to the opposition Labor Party to
form his third government.
   Lubbers has not ruled out any party as his future coalition
partner, reflecting the mainstream position traditionally taken by
his Christian Democrats.
   Lubbers' government fell in May when the right-wing Liberals,
junior partners in his center-right coalition government, resisted
his $3.3 billion plan to clean up the heavily polluted Dutch air,
soil and waterways by the year 2010.
   The Liberals object to a $296 million provision of the plan that
calls for cutting income tax deductions for people who use their
cars to get to work.
   The Liberals say the provision singles out one group, while
Lubbers argues that eliminating the deduction would cut exhaust
emissions and ease highway congestion.
   It was the first time a Western government had fallen over an
environmental issue. Lubbers, whose government is now in caretaker
status, called early elections that had been set for May 1990.
   The Cabinet crisis reflected not only concern for the
environment, but also years of irritation between Lubbers and the
Liberals, who balked at having to swallow Christian Democratic
programs.
   ``The environment is a very fashionable issue at the top of the
political agenda ... but as to what the parties are trying to
achieve, I haven't discovered all that much difference,'' Liberal
lawmaker Jan te Veldhuis told The Associated Press.
   Te Veldhuis added that his party, like Lubbers', would continue
with the National Environmental Policy Plan engineered in part by
Environment Minister Ed Nijpels, himself a Liberal, but would
continue to resist eliminating the deduction for car-driving
commuters.
   High unemployment and Lubbers' economic recovery program also are
among the top issues facing voters.
   According to a poll published last week, Lubbers' Christian
Democratic Appeal party will lose one of its 54 seats in the
150-seat Parliament, with the Labor Party of opposition leader Wim
Kok keeping its current 52 seats.
   The poll by the Inter@View organization in Amsterdam said the
Liberals will lose five of their 27 seats.
   Most electoral gains are projected to go to smaller groups on
either side of the political spectrum, including Green Left, an
upstart amalgam of environmentalists and anti-NATO activists that
could become the nation's fourth-largest party.
   The telegenic Lubbers, 50, enjoys wide popularity in the
Netherlands because he is credited with restoring confidence in the
nation's economy and spurring consumer spending.
   He has combined a gradual lowering of private and corporate taxes
with cuts in social programs to slash the $12.4 billion budget
deficit, which represents 7.1 percent of net national income.
   He has also promised to cut the 11.3 percent unemployment rate
and foster economic growth.
   In 1985, Lubbers proved his skills as a consensus builder by
engineering the acceptance on Dutch soil of 48 U.S. cruise missiles
in defiance of a large opposition movement. The missiles were
ultimately not placed because of the U.S.-Soviet accord on
eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   Even the left-wing magazine De Tijd noted last week that Lubbers
has the aura of a ``mild, wise statesman ... he speaks perfectly,
and is reason itself.''
   But to his critics, Lubbers represents the arrogance of a party
likely to be the centerpiece of Dutch governments for the
foreseeable future.
   The Christian Democrats or their predecessor parties have been in
every postwar ruling coalition. No single group has ever garnered
enough votes for a parliamentary majority.
   By contrast, Kok, former head of the nation's largest labor
organization, the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions, has failed to
project as forceful a public image.
   De Tijd called Kok ``drab and boring'' and said ``He's awkward in
his movements. He's all smiles, waves a little, but sits down far
too soon'' at election rallies.
   Labor wants to boost buying power for low-income families, which
has been falling steadily during the Lubbers era. It also wants to
fight unemployment by shortening the standard 38-hour working week
to 32 hours in most industries.

<HEAD>With PM-Bush-Drug Plan Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia's war on drugs in alliance with the
United States will move drug kingpins to neighboring Brazil and
Venezuela, Venezuelan Ambassador Alberto Consalvi said today.
   ``Brazil and Venezuela, among Colombia's most sensitive
neighbors, are in the midst of election campaigns and the extreme
divisions of the political leadership do not permit them to ...
agree on questions of vital importance such as defense against the
drug cartels,'' Consalvi said in an interview.
   Consalvi is a close ally of Venezuelan President Carlos Andres
Perez. Perez took office in February and his position was shaken
almost at once by bloody rioting over price rises. State and local
elections are to be held in Venezuela in December.
   Brazilians will vote in November to replace President Jose Sarney.
   ``Big areas in Colombia's neighbors that are not adequately
policed will be irresistible to the drug barons,'' Consalvi said.
   He said that in Venezuela, politicians seem to be losing
perspective on the risks in the drug war.
   ``In some countries and in important parts of their economy, the
presence of drug money has already been seen, and it stimulates the
economy mysteriously at a time of crisis,'' he said. ``The
penetration of drug money is one of the most insidious problems in
Latin America.''
   Consalvi added that the message being sent from this country is
that Latin Americans should limit their conflicts in view of the
common danger, not only of losing control of their economies to the
drug traffickers but also of interference in politics.
   ``What is happening in Colombia can happen in any other
country,'' he said.
   ``Political leaders can only avoid it by acting in time. It's a
race against the clock.''

   Dozens of South Korean farmers marched
outside a Seoul hotel Tuesday to demand cancellation of an American
food fair they say signals a U.S. invasion of the Korean
agricultural market.
   Two small groups of farmers shouted ``Stop the food fair'' as
they tried to march into the Hilton Hotel complex downtown, where a
U.S. Embassy-sponsored food fair is to be held Wednesday through
Saturday.
   Police said they arrested about 30 farmers but released all of
them a few hours later.
   About a dozen protesters, identifying themselves as members of
the National Council of Farmers, appeared just before a reception
honoring the U.S. food exposition was held in the hotel's grand
ballroom.
   ``Stop the food fair!'' farmers shouted as they unfurled a large
banner reading ``We oppose food imports which kill 10 million
farmers.''
   Police grabbed placards reading ``Yankee go home'' and chased
protesters around the hotel parking area.
   Ninty minutes later, another group of 40 farmers began a march
along a road leading to the hotel but were stopped by about 100
police officers. Several protesters were arrested.
   The National Council of Farmers, which claims to represent 11
nationwide groups, said it would hold protests until it halted the
food fair, which it said ``signals a U.S. invasion.''
   Lee Kyong-hae, chairman of the National Council of Young Farmers
and Fishermen, issued a statement saying his 45,000-member
organization ``cannot just idly watch the American attempt to invade
our market, shaking our agricultural industry to its roots.''
   South Korean farmers have staged violent protests demanding a
halt to imports of U.S. agricultural products. They say the imports
threaten their livelihood by destroying the domestic market.
   Washington has pressured Seoul to open its markets to help
decrease South Korea's $8.5 billion trade surplus with the United
States.
   South Korea purchased $2.25 billion worth of American farm
products last year, becoming Washington's second-largest
agricultural customer after Japan. The volume is expected to
increase 15 percent to 20 percent this year, government officials
say.
   The 63 companies represented in the food fair have products that
all have been approved for export to South Korea, the embassy said.
They include everything from jelly, wine and prunes to microwave
popcorn.
   Marilyn Bonin of the California Department of Agriculture said
about half the products in the show are from California. Asked if
protests concerned her, she said ``Not at all. Change is hard, and
we've had farmers protests in the States also.''
   Frank Morrison of Clearwater, Neb., was in Seoul to market his
microwave popcorn.
   ``We were told protests would be peaceful,'' he said. ``They have
to know that as a country, they can't continue to just export, but
will have to import also. It will take time to change.''
   The protesters Tuesday issued a statement that included a large
cartoon of Uncle Sam, dressed as Batman with fangs, arriving in
Seoul, and Korean farmers dying in their fields.

   The way Dallas elects its City Council _ an issue
voters supposedly decided only weeks ago _ went before a federal
judge today, who could order changes if he finds minorities aren't
getting a fair shake.
   A lawyer for two blacks who ran unsuccesfully for City Council
opened the trial by saying blacks have trouble getting elected
because of Dallas' system, under which some candidates are elected
from districts and some from the city as a whole.
   ``Subtle or not so subtle, racial discrimination has occurred in
past City Council elections,'' said Betsy Julian, attorney for Roy
Williams and Marvin Crenshaw. They sued in 1988 and were joined by a
Hispanic group, alleging that the set-up dilutes minority voting
power.
   But Paul Pearce, an attorney for the city of Dallas, said no
pattern can be established that shows the apportionment
discriminates against minorities.
   ``In the last 14 elections, since 1983, the black preferred
candidate has been successful in nine races,'' he said.
   Williams and Crenshaw are asking U.S. District Judge Jerry
Buchmeyer to order the city to restructure the council into 15
districts.
   On Aug. 12, voters approved a plan under which the mayor would be
elected at large and other council members would be elected from
``super districts,'' but that plan does not go into effect for two
years.
   ``It is about self-determination and an end to apartheid in this
city,'' said Crenshaw. ``Dallas is one of the few cities that didn't
receive a challenge from the African-American community during the
civil rights movement of the 1960s. Now, it's Dallas' time.''
   The city denies that the current apportionment discriminates
against minorities. The city claims that the voters' right to pick
their system of government is at stake and it denies that the
current system is discriminatory.
   Both sides say the outcome will shape the Dallas city government
for years. Any judicial precedents that are set could affect local,
state and federal voting districts throughout the nation.
   Minority leaders long have said the city is dominated by its
business community and predominantly white north Dallas
neighborhoods.
   The current council, governing a population estimated to be 51
percent minority, consists of nine non-Hispanic whites, two blacks
and no Hispanics.
   Under Dallas' 8-3 council system, eight members are elected in
single-member districts, and three, including the mayor, are elected
at-large.
   The new 10-4-1 system, scheduled to go into effect in 1991, would
include 10 council members from single districts, four from
quadrants or ``super districts,'' and only the mayor would be
elected at-large.
   Betsy Julian, attorney for the plaintiffs, called the plan ``too
little, too late,'' and said it was a ``last-minute, peace-keeping
concession to maintain the status quo.''
   ``We will show there is a long history of racially polarized
voting in the city of Dallas,'' Ms. Julian said.
   Some say the case will influence realignments on all levels of
government after the 1990 census.
   ``The Dallas hearing is the first of many related cases,'' said
Sonya Jarvis, executive director of the Washington-based National
Coalition of Black Voter Participation. ``It will be a microcosm of
what's going to happen around the nation following the 1990 census.''
   Dallas' 10-4-1 plan emerged after Mayor Annette Strauss appointed
a multiethnic business and civic group to find solutions to racial
tension in the city following a series of deadly confrontations
between minority citizens and police.
   Black and Hispanic leaders opposed the 10-4-1 plan, which was
approved 41,456 to 20,823 in a turnout of less than 14 percent of
registered voters. Analyses by precinct showed whites voted for the
plan and blacks and Hispanics against it.

   Labor Day weekend ended with a
skirmish after two nights of clashes between police and black
college students. The U.S. Justice Department said it was studying
videotapes to see if police used excessive force.
   Shortly before midnight Monday, a crowd of about 40 young people
protested when a police dog tore at the clothes of a man officers
were arresting. Police sealed off the area and the confrontation
ended about 20 minutes later.
   Today, Atlantic Avenue, jammed by an estimated 100,000 young
people 48 hours earlier, was nearly deserted, with many shops
boarded up.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah
Burstion-Wade said ``it's very possible'' the FBI and the
department's civil rights division will open an investigation into
whether police and National Guardsmen used undue force to quell the
rioting.
   She said the department is reviewing videotapes of the clashes to
determine if there is a basis for a criminal investigation. So far,
the department has received no citizen complaints of excessive
police force, she said.
   During the melees, police wielded 30-inch riot batons but used no
tear gas against rioters, who threw bottles and bricks and looted at
least 100 businesses. Two men were wounded by gunfire, but
authorities said officers fired no shots.
   Students from predominantly black East Coast colleges made up
much of the crowd, in town for the annual fraternity festival that
marks the end of summer.
   During the weekend, at least 260 people were arrested, half of
them area residents, and hundreds of summonses issued, authorities
said. At least 43 people were injured, including 30 police officers
and 13 youths. Property damage was in the millions of dollars, said
Mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf.
   At the start of the weekend, businessmen in the town of 260,000
year-round residents had hoped for a large turnout to offset a slow
summer. The turnout was greater than expected, but dreams of a
prosperous weekend evaporated early Sunday.
   City officials ordered police to clear Atlantic Avenue, the major
thoroughfare that was packed from sidewalk to sidewalk for about 30
blocks.
   As a wedge of officers moved down the street, they were pelted
with bottles. Ahead of police, youths broke store windows and looted
shops. At city leaders' request, Gov. Gerald L. Baliles called out
the National Guard.
   On Sunday night, city police, officers from neighboring
localities, at least 200 state troopers and about 150 Guardsmen
cleared an estimated 45,000 people from Atlantic Avenue. The beach
section was closed and those on the beachfront were told to return
to their rooms or face arrest.
   ``It appears to be a case of too many people in a confined
space,'' Oberndorf said. ``It appears to be a case of critical mass
of people building up an rapid mood changes in a huge crowd.''
   Civil rights leaders said problems developed, in part, because
the city failed to make any preparations for the visitors other than
to call out the police.
   ``The city had no damn idea what it was getting into. It had no
contact with the black community and no idea of the numbers
involved,'' said Jack W. Gravely, president of the state National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   The NAACP said police overreacted, and that the city and
merchants had made the students feel unwelcome. Gravely said,
however, that those responsible for the looting should be prosecuted.
   Black leaders said had the crowd been predominantly white, police
would have reacted differently.
   Oberndorf called that ``poppycock.''
   ``All police reports and our videotape show that the city
controlled response to situations that have arisen,'' she said.
   The mayor showed edited videotapes to reporters Monday afternoon.
The tapes showed the extensive looting Sunday morning, but the
street clearing by police was edited out. A tape of Sunday night's
confrontation showed a phalanx of several hundred officers moving
toward a group of youths. Again, the actual dispersal of the crowd
was edited out.
   Police, Oberndorf said, ``have rendered a tremendous service to
this community.''
   But Gravely said police heavyhandedness was partly to blame for
the violence.
   ``Their response was to confront the students from a position of
power,'' he said.
   That, Gravely said, led to the first confrontation as students
``felt squeezed'' by police and ``felt a need to show discontent.''
   City officials said the only way they could ensure the protection
of life and property was to clear the street. ``Our guests _ as long
as they are willing to behave themselves _ are welcome,'' Oberndorf
said.
   Business leaders had no estimate in the amount of lost business
because of the violence.
   ``We have to get past this weekend. The business community has to
sit down with a level-headed approach and decide what we are going
to do next,'' said Flo McDaniel, executive director of the Virginia
Beach Hotel and Motel Asociation.

   People holding U.S. government checks soon will
have one year to cash them, or go to the trouble of having the
government agency reissue them, the Treasury Department said Tuesday.
   A new law requires such checks dated Oct. 1 and later to be
cashed within one year of their issue. The phrase, ``Void After One
Year,'' will be printed on the checks as a reminder.
   The law also requires people holding checks dated prior to Oct. 1
to cash them no later than Sept. 30, 1990.
   Commissioner W. E. Douglas of the department's Financial
Management Service said in a statement that ``not only is it a poor
business practice to keep the government's books open `forever,' it
is also expensive to maintain the records. And it's the taxpayers
who have to pick up the tab.''
   Douglas said the public now holds about 6 million uncashed
government checks worth more than $2.5 billion that are more than a
year old.
   The checks range in value from two cents for a 1945 income tax
refund to a $8,606 compensation check dated April 9, 1954. The
oldest uncashed check is one dated April 15, 1919 for $1.01 in
interest on a World War I Liberty Bond.
   The department emphasized the time limit does not affect the
government's liability. But if the time limit is exceeded, the check
will be cancelled and the person to whom it was written will have to
apply to the agency that wrote it for a replacement.
   The federal government issues about 550 million checks a year
worth more than $600 billion, the department said.

   The Caribbean's easternmost islands reported large
swells and heavy surf as Gabrielle, the most powerful hurricane of
the Atlantic season, tossed gale-force winds today in a
400-mile-wide spiral.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Felix was upgraded to a hurricane early
today after its sustained winds topped 74 mph, but was in the middle
of the northern Atlantic and posed no threat to land, the National
Hurricane Center reported.
   With top winds of 130 mph, Gabrielle's center was expected to
pass north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands today.
   ``It's a very large storm,'' hurricane specialist Jim Gross said
today. ``We don't have anything that looks like it would deflect it
right now.''
   As of noon EDT, Gabrielle was centered near 21.1 north latitude
and 57.9 west longitude, 550 miles east-northeast of San Juan,
Puerto Rico. It was moving northwest at 12 mph.
   Forecasters expected the season's fourth hurricane to strengthen
and hold its course through Wednesday morning but said they wouldn't
know until it nears the Bahamas on Friday whether it will hit the
U.S. mainland or veer north.
   ``The storm is actually a long way away from any potential
impact,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center, who nevertheless warned people in U.S. coastal areas to
follow its progress closely.
   Tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph were spotted 250
miles northeast of Gabrielle's center on Monday and 150 miles in the
opposite direction.
   Gabrielle formed Thursday near the Cape Verde Islands off Africa.
Its growth has been typical of some of the most destructive
hurricanes, forecasters said.
   Little additional strengthening was expected for Hurricane Felix,
which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold for hurricanes at 6 a.m.
and had 80 mph winds at noon.
   Its center was near 36.7 north latitude and 49.0 west longitude,
or 975 miles west of the Azores. It was drifting north-northwest at
5 mph.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November.

   More than 400 people died in accidents on the
nation's roads during the Labor Day weekend.
   As of 1 p.m. EDT today, law enforcement and other authorities had
reported 431 fatalities.
   The National Safety Council projected last week that there could
be between 420 and 520 traffic deaths over the three-day holiday,
which traditionally marks the end of summer.
   For counting purposes, the weekend began at 6 p.m. local time
Friday and ended at 11:59 p.m. Monday.
   Council spokeswoman Gail Mansfield said 422 traffic fatalities
were recorded in 1988. The highest toll for the holiday weekend was
in 1968, when 688 people died.

   Miss New Hampshire, Jennifer Ann
Landry, had to wake up at 3:45 a.m. and endure a bumpy flight to be
the first candidate to arrive Tuesday for the Miss America Pageant.
   ``I'm honored to be the first one,'' Ms. Landry, 22, said about
9:30 a.m. after descending the steps from a small commuter plane at
Bader Field.
   As her 10 pieces of luggage were packed into a car trunk, Ms.
Landry pulled out a small, white teddy bear which she said was a
good-luck charm given to her by the daughter of the New Hampshire
pageant director.
   The 5-foot-6 blonde, blue-eyed contestant also received what she
considered an unsolicited boost from the pilot of her plane.
   ``He mistook me for Miss America,'' Ms. Landry said. But she
added that her real talisman will be the 100 friends and relatives
she expects to come to watch her compete.
   All 51 contestants arriving Tuesday will rehearse and make a
series of public appearances. Beginning Sept. 12, they compete in
preliminary competition leading to the 69-year-old pageant's
nationally televised finals Sept. 16.
   ``Greeters'' from the pageant limited reporters' questions
because ``sometimes the girls will run off at the mouth a little,''
said Millie Frambes, one of the four greeters for Ms. Landry.
   However, Ms. Landry seemed eager to answer questions, saying her
plane ride was a ``little bumpy,'' and telling reporters of her
pre-dawn rise.
   Ms. Landry is a University of New Hampshire student majoring in
child care-special education.
   In a new twist this year, each contestant has submitted an essay
on an issue of her choice, Horn said. If she wins the crown, she
will be able to promote that issue during her reign, he said.
   The new Miss America will succeed Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson of
Minnesota.

   The Navy on Thursday will release the findings
of its months-long investigation into the explosion aboard the USS
Iowa that claimed the lives of 47 crewmen, it was announced today.
   Navy investigators have searched to find the cause of the April
19 tragedy, when powder exploded in the battleship's No. 2 gun
turret during open-seas gunnery practice near Puerto Rico.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the report is 1,100 pages
in length, and will be discussed at a briefing by the vice chief of
naval operations, Adm. Leon Edney and the investigating officer,
Rear Adm. Richard Milligan.
   Williams said the two intended to offer a ``very thorough''
briefing on the accident. He declined to discuss the details of the
report in advance.
   Meanwhile, a sailor from the battleship says Navy investigators
browbeat him into implicating shipmate Clayton Hartwig in the
explosion.
   In an interview with ABC News broadcast on Monday, Seaman David
Smith said he believed that Hartwig, a gunner's mate, was innocent
of causing the explosion that destroyed one of the battleship's gun
turrets.
   According to reports earlier this summer, Smith told naval
investigators that Hartwig had made sexual advances to him the night
before the explosion and that on other occasions Hartwig had talked
about how to set off explosions and showed him a timer device.
   ``Part of me can see him doing it,'' Smith was quoted as saying.
   Hartwig died in the explosion with the other sailors.
   In his ABC News interview, Smith said the investigators
questioned him in sessions lasting up to 12 hours and threatened to
charge him with 47 counts of murder and accessory to murder if he
did not cooperate.
   Smith said investigators put words into his mouth and distorted
his testimony, ABC said. Smith said he did not receive a homosexual
proposition from Hartwig and never heard of any timing device owned
by Hartwig, ABC said.
   Navy spokesman Kendall Pease said he was unaware of the ABC
report and had no comment.
   In Cleveland, Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina, said her campaign
to clear her brother of suspicion in the case has been given a boost
by the news report.
   ``This only adds credence to what I've been saying,'' she said.
   She said of Smith, ``It doesn't surprise me a bit that he is now
recanting his story. I knew somebody would get to this kid and make
him tell the truth.''
   Ms. Kubicina said her own efforts to meet with Smith have been
unsuccessful.
   She said she went to Norfolk to try to meet with him face to
face. ``He refused to see me,'' she said, ``but I've talked to a
couple of the guys who survived and they assured me this kid never
had any contact with my brother.
   ``The guys aboard the ship didn't know the reason why he would
say these things,'' she added.
   Ms. Kubicina also said she was dismayed by questions she was
asked by two Navy investigators who were in Cleveland to meet with
her.
   ``The gay angle was it for them,'' she said. ``They didn't want

<HEAD>Five Japanese Accused of Trying to Sell Uranium to U.S. Officials</HEAD>

   Five Japanese were arrested for trying to sell
nearly nine pounds of refined uranium to the U.S. Embassy for $83
million, police said Tuesday.
   In concentrated form, the radioactive chemical element can be
used for nuclear power generation and nuclear bombs. However,
nuclear experts said the substance offered by the suspects was
nearly in its natural state and would require more processing for
almost any use.
   City police said the four men and a woman were arrested Friday
after offering to sell the uranium to the Embassy in Tokyo at about
2,000 times its market value.
   Police said they were tipped off about the case by the U.S.
Embassy and secretly took pictures of the suspects in cooperation
with the Embassy before making the arrests.
   Police said they seized photographs from the suspects showing
about 40 metal capsules that appeared to contain uranium. They said
the suspects offered to sell a total of 8.8 pounds of the substance.
   Authorities said Tuesday the five were arrested for illegal
possession of nuclear substances but had not been formally charged.
   Police said the suspects brought a capsule with 3.5 ounces of
uranium to the Embassy in early August and offered the rest for sale
later.
   Police said they sent the substance in the capsule to the Science
and Technology Agency, which found it was refined natural uranium of
70.7 percent purity.
   The analysis showed only 0.71 percent was uranium-235, the kind
used for power generation and bombs. Experts say nuclear power
generation requires more than 3 percent uranium-235, and an atomic
bomb needs more than 90 percent of that same type.
   Nuclear experts, including Prof. Kyoji Naito of Nagoya
Univerisity, said the uranium was almost in its natural state and
thus had little use without further processing.
   They said it could be harmful if the human body were exposed to
it for an extended time.
   The American Embassy said laboratory analysis showed the
substance had posed no danger to Embassy personnel or the public.
   Naito and the police said the price the suspects demanded shows
they did not know the uranium's value. The same type is being sold
at about $275 per ounce, making the price the group demanded more
than 2,000 times greater than its market value.
   Takaharu Ushikoshi, head of the police department's public
security, said police do not believe the groups had terrorist or
political motives. ``It looks like the group's intent was purely
money,'' he said.
   Ushikoshi said one suspect said the group bought the uranium from
an unidentified person for $35 million.
   He suggested the suspects tried to sell the material to the
Embassy because ``they probably thought ordinary people or companies
wouldn't buy such an outrageous thing.''
   Police identified the alleged ringleader as a 43-year-old woman,
Toshiko Nishijima, who owns several small companies.
   The others were identified as Koichi Tsuru, 33, owner of a
securities firm in Hong Kong; Toshitada Mizuno, 44, a real estate
firm owner; Kasutoshi Okazaki, 44, a master of the traditional
Japanese tea ceremony; and Tomoyuki Nishida, 39, owner of a trading
company.

   A U.S.-built F-16 jet fighter of the
Pakistan Air Force crashed during a training mission, and the pilot
was killed, military officials said Tuesday.
   The military issued a statement saying the jet went down Monday
near Jhang, 175 miles south of Islamabad, the capital.
   Squadron Leader Zafar Ahsan was killed, but there was no damage
or injuries on the ground, the military said. An investigation was
under way.
   Pakistan acquired 50 of the F-16s in 1985. Three have crashed,
including one that hit a wild pig on a runway.
   The United States has agreed to sell Pakistan 60 more of the jets.

   Two Vietnamese women who escaped
the killing fields of their homeland to find success in the U.S.
military say the fiercest motivation to make their lives count came
when they were closest to death.
   Anne Nguyen was 5 and Jean Nguyen-Doyne was 12 when North
Vietnamese forces captured Saigon in 1975. Mrs. Nguyen-Doyne said
their father, a colonel in the South Vietnamese army, called the
family into his bedroom to tell them of a possible enemy attack. But
he had a plan.
   ``He wanted to commit suicide for all of us,'' she said. ``He
called all of us in and told us he had a Claymore mine he had saved
and he was going to set it off to kill us. He said he would rather
have us die together than suffer separately.''
   But a family friend persuaded their father instead to flee the
country with him, beginning the family's odyssey to the United
States.
   In 1985, Mrs. Nguyen-Doyne became the first Vietnamese woman to
graduate from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, earning a
bachelor of science degree with a double major in Spanish and
French. Now a first lieutenant, she is an intelligence officer
stationed at Fort Carson Army Post in Colorado Springs.
   Miss Nguyen has completed basic training at the Air Force Academy
in Colorado Springs and is just beginning her four years as a cadet
there. She wants to be an Air Force pilot.
   Mrs. Nguyen-Doyne said the fact that she nearly died still
compels her to succeed.
   ``I felt helpless,'' she said of her father's intent to kill
himself, his wife and their six children. ``I didn't want to waste
myself. I think that is still my motivation that kept me going.''
   After leaving Saigon, the refugee family spent several days
moving among Vietnam's coastal islands before hitching a ride on a
military vessel. Built to hold about 1,200 people, the ship carried
about 3,500 people on a seven-day voyage to a refugee camp in Guam.
   Three months later, the family was in a refugee camp in Fort
Chaffee, Ark., and not long thereafter, the Lutheran Church agreed
to sponsor them in Milton, Pa.
   ``I thought America must be a very rich country,'' said Mrs.
Nguyen-Doyne, now 26. ``Everyone had cars and houses. We were used
to two families living in small houses. The markets were very
impressive, too. We had no indoor markets in Vietnam. No
refrigeration.''
   The sisters soon were ``Americanized.'' They were given English
names _ their Vietnamese first names were virtually unpronounceable
here _ and became highly motivated students.
   For Mrs. Nguyen-Doyne, the hard work paid off when she was
selected from more than 10,000 applicants to attend West Point.
   ``Our parents emphasized the importance of honor, duty,
country,'' she said. ``I feel very fortunate to be able to attend
the (West Point) academy.''
   Her father graduated from the Vietnamese National Academy before
becoming a South Vietnamese army officer. Besides the sisters who
attended military academies, there is another sister in the Navy and
a brother in the Army infantry.
   The sisters say they appreciate the opportunities they have
received and believe American freedoms cannot be taken for granted.
   ``There are more opportunities here, especially for women,'' said
Miss Nguyen, now 19. ``There are so many things women are allowed to
do here. In Vietnam, the attitude was that women should be barefoot
and pregnant.''
   Mrs. Nguyen-Doyne said American freedoms are worth fighting for.
   ``When you come from another country without the freedoms there
are here, you work as hard as you can to make sure you never lose
those freedoms,'' she said. ``I want to contribute as much as I can
to the army and the country. I don't take the word freedom lightly.''

<HEAD>Walesa Pleads for Western Aid at Start of West German Visit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DUESSELDORF, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's Solidarity leader, Lech
Walesa, began a West German visit Tuesday with a plea for Western
aid, saying Solidarity's plan for economic reform in Poland will
crumble without it.
   ``Our victory in Poland is like a house of cards,'' Walesa said
during a luncheon with the board of directors of the powerful German
Federation of Labor Unions. ``It would crumble if it were not
financially ensured.''
   Walesa, on the first day of a five-day visit, also met with
Johannes Rau, governor of the industrial state of North
Rhine-Westphalia.
   He presented Rau with a list of 16 proposed projects for West
German companies in the Baltic port city of Gdansk, Walesa's
hometown and the birthplace of the Solidarity trade union movement.
   Neither Rau nor Walesa gave details about the proposed projects.
   Walesa said he was extending an invitation to West Germans to
``come and rebuild Poland'' and urged West Germany to make a quick
decision on financial assistance to the country. ``The longer one
waits the more expensive everything becomes,'' he said.
   ``The East bloc, which has lifted its Iron Curtain, can also be
attractive to Western investors,'' he added.
   West Germany has built good business ties with Eastern Europe,
and the United States has suggested it take the lead in the West's
efforts to support East bloc reforms.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has promised West German aid
for Poland, but the two sides have been unable to agree on how much.
The more conservative wing in Kohl's coalition government also wants
to link the aid to Polish promises to improve the condition of
ethnic Germans in Poland.
   Walesa is trying to secure aid to help promote Polish reforms
under the new government of Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
named last month as the East bloc's first non-Communist government
leader.
   Upon arrival at Duesseldorf airport Tuesday, Walesa called for
East and West to overcome economic and political barriers, creating
a Europe ``where everyone feels that they are free.''
   ``We have the chance to work together fruitfully. From the
airplane, I saw that we are indeed a united Europe, but it is hilly
here and there, and there are also other obstacles,'' Walesa told
reporters through an interpreter.
   ``I believe that these hills, obstacles and walls can be
removed,'' he said.
   Differences between the two countries spoiled Kohl's hopes of
traveling to Poland to mark the 50th anniversary of the start of
World War II.
   Relations between the two countries have been strained by recent
suggestions by West Germany's conservative finance minister, Theo
Waigel, that Polish lands once part of the German empire technically
still belong to Germany.
   On Tuesday afternoon, Labor Minister Norbert Bluem said he had
told Walesa that a month-old West German ban on Polish seasonal
workers was being lifted.
   Speaking to reporters after meeting with Walesa, Bleum said there
would be negotiations between Poland and West Germany on a quota for
such workers.
   Thousands of Poles spend months in West Germany to earn hard
currency, usually charging less for their labor then Germans. The
practice has angered West Germans who have to compete with the Poles
for work.
   Walesa is scheduled to meet with Kohl on Thursday.
   Kohl's chief spokesman, Hans Klein, said Kohl and Walesa would
discuss ``the situation in Poland following the government
changeover, economic conditions there, international aid measures
for Poland, and the future cooperation between our two countries.''

   Gov. Terry Branstad on Tuesday announced
a program to hire more drug-fighting prosecutors and narcotics
agents.
   Many details of the package will depend on how much President
Bush proposes for aid programs to states in a $7.8 billion federal
program he was to announce Tuesday night.
   The cost of the governor's proposals was put at $10 million, plus
a 30 percent increase in prevention and treatment programs, which
now cost $13.5 million.
   Branstad said the focus of the effort would be on hard drugs such
as cocaine and heroin, but treatment and education also are
important components.
   ``We're not going to win this drug war simply with additional
cops,'' Branstad said.
   ``We are beginning to see a reduction in casual use of drugs,''
Branstad said. But he said reports of violent, drug-related crime
are increasing.
   The Iowa National Guard, however, plans to continue its aerial
searches which so far have located 80 marijuana patches, leading to
the seizure of drugs with a street value of $4 million, spokesman
Warren Lawson said.
   The governor's proposal includes:
   _Hiring of eight new prosecutors to work for the attorney general
and help local prosecutors in drug cases.
   _Hiring 10 new drug enforcement agents.
   _Providing a ``hard suspension'' of driving privileges for those
caught driving while using alcohol or drugs. Aides said that meant
the elimination of probation and other options that allow continued
driving.
   _Beefing up treatment programs targeted at women, the unemployed
and youngsters.
   _Providing funding to allow state troopers to train local police
in drug education programs.

   A moderate earthquake struck the northern
Aegean on Tuesday but caused no damages or injuries, the Athens
Geodynamic Institute said.
   A spokesman for the institute said the quake registered 5.4 on
the Richter scale and hit at 9:52 a.m., 161 miles northeast of
Athens. Its epicenter was in the Aegean Sea, northwest of the island
of Limnos, he said.
   A number of quakes have hit Greece in the past month. A quake
measuring 4.8 on the Richter scale rolled through the western part
of the country Friday, damaging 22 buildings but causing no injuries.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage in a populated
area.

   Two young brothers who went out to pick
up golf balls for pocket change were stabbed to death in a park,
police said today.
   Acting Police Chief Bob King said William James Neer, 10, and
Cole Laverne Neer, 11, were stabbed repeatedly in the chest a
half-mile from home. He said there was no evidence they were
tortured or otherwise molested.
   Police said they had no motive and no suspects in the slayings.
   Investigators searched the scene ``on their hands and knees''
this morning for clues, King said.
   The boys left home about 4 p.m. Monday, telling their father they
were going to a driving range to pick up golf balls, police said.
King said the boys earned money by turning in balls that were hit
over the fence.
   The boys' father reported them missing about 10 p.m. King said
it's not known whether the youngsters reached the area where they
collected balls.
   A passerby found the younger boy dead in a ditch in a wooded
section of Vancouver's David Douglas Park shortly before 7 p.m.
Monday. The other body was found off a trail 110 yards away just
after 2 a.m., police said.
   King said the younger boy apparently was dead when he was found,
but his body was warm enough that officers decided to call for
emergency medical treatment.

   A 5-year-old boy's game of hide-and-seek
turned into hide-and-stuck when he climbed into a washing machine
that kicked on when he closed the lid.
   It took two men 15 minutes to extract the 35-pound Donovan Redden
from the machine in the laundry room at an apartment complex where
he and his sister and three cousins were playing Monday.
   ``It scared me,'' Donovan said later at Florida Hospital, where
he was examined and released after complaining his head hurt. ``I
was stuck.''
   He said he dove head-first into the machine to hide from his
playmates. The machine apparently had not completed its last cycle
and started up when Donovan pulled the door down. It did not fill
with water.
   He was ``wrapped like a sheet around the pole,'' said one of the
men who heard Donovan and the other children yelling and then helped
pull him out.
   ``He was crying and hollering and sweating,'' said his mother,
Dorothy Orr. Besides the headache and a little soreness, Donovan was
not seriously hurt.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Tuesday it is
tightening security following persistent news reports of imminent
terrorist attacks on the Mediterranean island.
   An official announcement said a top level security conference
presided over by Interior Minister Christodoulos Veniamin ``decided
on taking a series of measures aimed at the further strengthening of
internal security and preventing criminal activities in Cyprus.''
   Witnesses have reported more frequent foot and mobile patrols by
paramilitary police at the island's two civil airports, at Larnaca
on the south coast and at Paphos on the west.
   Extra security also has been mounted at other sensitive spots,
including major foreign diplomatic missions.
   The increased security also is believed to be linked to the
transit through Larnaca airport in the past week of several heads of
state en route to the summit conference of the non-aligned movement
in Belgrade. The same leaders will be passing through the airport on
their way home at the end of the week.
   The additional security follows two serious terrorist incidents
on the island in the past two months.
   Six Lebanese Moslems armed with a shoulder-fired anti-aircraft
missile launcher were arrested near Larnaca airport in July. They
confessed they had arrived on the island to shoot down the
helicopter of Christian Lebanese leader Gen. Michel Aoun, who had
been expected at the airport.
   Authorities fear that other Lebanese terrorists may attempt an
aircraft hijack or some other operation to demand the release of the
six Lebanese who are awaiting trial.
   In the other incident, late in August, an Iranian Kurdish leader
was shot to death and another Iranian was critically wounded in
Larnaca by two unknown assailants.
   It was the first such incident involving Iranians on the island,
which has been frequently caught in the cross fire of Middle East
rivalries like the Arab-Israeli conflict or other inter-Arab feuds.

   The court jester at the Royal Britain Exhibition
made unkind jokes about the royal family and the commercial museum's
managers, not amused, told him to stop or get the sack. He was
suspended Tuesday.
   Kim Keble-White said James Lovell, a 24-year-old actor, could
have his job back if he cut the offending material from his act.
   Lovell, who traveled to and from work in tricorn hat, bells and
quartered red and green outfit, was not available for comment after
the announcement, but said earlier Tuesday he would not alter his
performance.
   In somewhat medieval syntax, Lovell said he realized his boss was
irritated, ``but Lord fool him for being thus inflamed, for I am the
fool, and therefore for him to get inflamed by my foolery makes him
a fool, for sure.''
   ``He is acting with artistic pique,'' declared Keble-White,
marketing director of the exhibition, who said the young jester had
been ``doing a super job'' before turning his wit on contemporary
targets.
   Keble-White said some of Lovell's jokes ``are a little bit tacky
and he doesn't know exactly where to draw the line.''
   For example: ``What is small, silent and lonely and lives in a
stable? Captain Phillips.'' That is a jibe at shy, horse-loving Mark
Phillips, whose separation from his wife, Princess Anne, was
announced last week.
   A parody on the eccentricities of Prince Charles, heir to the
throne, was another feature of Lovell's act for visitors to the
exhibition on British royalty through the ages.
   He did a three-minute monologue of Charles talking to a
sunflower. It was inspired by the prince's revelation some years
back that he talked to his plants to encourage growth.
   Executives of Unicorn Heritage, which owns Royal Britain, say
Lovell was an excellent jester until pointing his japery beyond
medieval royalty.
   ``I said to James, `We'd love you to carry on, old chap, but it
must be jokes of the period,''' Keble-White said in an interview.
   ``I am nervous that some of the jokes could be offensive, and we
want to prevent people from coming here thinking we want to win some
cheap laughs.''
   Lovell responded: ``I've been making a few little rudies. They
come out because I'm a spontaneous jester, my liege, I don't write
my riddles down. I suddenly think of something and if I think of
Fergie as a big red thing then that's, alas, what she is.''
   Fergie is the nickname for the Duchess of York, whose hair is red
and whose waistline is avidly watched by the tabloid press.
   Lovell worked as a clown and stage actor before taking the role
of Will Somers, court jester to Henry VIII jester, in January.
   He acknowledged on London Broadcasting Corp. radio that his duty
was to behave as a medieval clown, but added: ``I am a jester, my
liege, and I, a jester, is licensed to say whatever I wish, so if
they don't like it they can right royally stuff it.''
   Keble-White said he had received no complaints from Buckingham
Palace or the 500,000 people who have visited the exhibition in
London's financial district since it opened in August 1988.
   In depicting British history through royalty, the commercial
museum features the lives of 52 kings and queens.
   It has dummies in period dress and enlargements of contemporary
newspaper front pages with stories on royalty. Visitors can vote on
whether the press treats royals fairly, and Keble-White said the
tide is running against the press.
   Buckingham Palace cooperated in setting up the exhibition, he
said, ``so it's important we not fall from grace'' through Lovell's
antics.

   The man who faces murder charges in the
slaying of Black Panther co-founder Huey P. Newton was granted a
six-day delay for entering a plea Tuesday so his lawyer can review
the case.
   Police say Tyrone Robinson, 25, confessed to the pre-dawn
shooting and hoped the killing would advance his standing in a
prison-based street gang. He appeared briefly in court with his
hands shackled at his waist.
   Municipal Court Judge Horace Wheatley granted the extension until
Monday to allow attorney Alfons Wagner time to prepare his case.
   Wagner, appointed by the court, has interviewed Robinson but said
after the hearing that he does not really know enough about the case
to comment. He described Robinson as ``calm, responsive to my
questions. He knows he's in trouble.''
   Deputy Alameda County District Attorney Terese Drabec said
witnesses ``sharply contrast'' Robinson's version of the incident.
   Police say Robinson has admitted shooting Newton three times in
the head early on Aug. 22. Robinson, described by police as a
low-level crack dealer and member of the prison gang known as the
Black Guerrilla Family, claimed he shot Newton in self-defense after
Newton pulled a gun and demanded drugs. Newton was 47.
   Robinson told officers Newton robbed him of 14 crack rocks and
$160 earlier this year and also had ripped off other BGF members.
   Homicide investigator Sgt. Robert Chenault has said there is no
evidence to support Robinson's claim of self-defense. Drabec said
Robinson may not actually be a member of the BGF; she said she heard
he was trying to join.
   Newton formed the Black Panthers in the 1960s with Bobby Seale
and served as its defense minister. Newton's position with the
Panthers led him into frequent confrontations with police.

   Elizabeth Graber can't remember all the
names of her great-grandchildren, but then she has an excuse.
   There are 154 of them.
   Their ages range from 6 weeks to 20 years, and they are scattered
from Indiana to Pennsylvania and from Mississippi to Canada.
   Despite the distance, Mrs. Graber, 87, manages to see most of her
great-grandchildren at least once a year.
   Big families aren't unusual for Mrs. Graber. She is one of 12
children herself and her late husband, Elmer, was one of 11. The
couple raised ``only'' six themselves.
   She says most of her 53 grandchildren ``got a fast start'' on
adding to the clan. ``Some haven't started yet,'' she says, noting
that seven have not yet married. And she's still waiting on her
first great-great grandchild.
   Mrs. Graber keeps a book with the names and birthdates of her 154
great-grandchildren, along with their pictures.
   The whole family gets together at least once a year for a
reunion. Mrs. Graber also tries to visit relatives in Kokomo, Ind.,
every few months and travels to Mississippi and Pennsylvania at
least once a year.
   ``When the bus comes by, I jump in,'' she says.

   If Tom Wigle is the only person elected to
village office this fall, will he be a one-man government? As a
councilman, will he be a quorum by himself?
   Could he elect himself council president, allowing himself to
become mayor?
   State officials are trying to answer those questions, since Wigle
was the only person to file a petition before the deadline as a
candidate in the November elections in this northwest Ohio village
of 153 people. No one is running for mayor or five of six council
positions.
   The Ohio secretary of state's office is searching state statutes
in hopes of finding out whether one person can legally run the
government and to establish a procedure for the village.
   ``They may be breaking new ground,'' Steven Fought, spokesman for
the secretary of state's office, said Tuesday of the situation.
   Wigle, who is running for re-election as councilman, thinks a
one-man government isn't such a bad idea. His theory is that one
person knowing what he's doing is better than seven who get nothing
done.
   ``I've often wondered why one person couldn't run this village
with a lawyer and a bookkeeper,'' he told the Kenton Times.
   Mayor Susan McClurg and two council members resigned earlier this
year. Councilwoman Pat McKee assumed the role of mayor, leaving
three council seats vacant. Making matters worse, the positions of
mayor and those held by the three remaining council members are up
for re-election.
   Patterson's problem could be solved if other residents run as
write-in candidates, Fought said. Such candidates must file by Sept.
28.

   A man who was awakened by automobile
lights and thought his home was being vandalized chased a car and
watched in horror as it slammed into a train, killing all three
people in the car, police said.
   Killed in the crash early Monday were two 18-year-olds and a
34-year-old man.
   The unidentified homeowner told police his house had been
vandalized previously and he was afraid it was happening again, so
he jumped in his car and gave chase, police said.
   He chased the other car a half-mile before it hit a train at a
crossing marked with signs but no lights, said Trooper Robert Beaver.
   The homeowner ``just kept repeating over and over he wished he
wouldn't have went after'' the other car, Beaver said. ``He was just
beside himself, especially since he knew the families.''
   Police said that the motorist who drove up to the homeowner's
house had been chasing the homeowner's teen-age son, who had been
caught with two other teen-agers shining a flashlight into a field
looking for deer.
   No charges were filed.

   A hearing in Jim Bakker's fraud trial will be
held Wednesday and the TV evangelist, now in a prison hospital for
psychiatric tests, will be there, an official in the U.S. Marshal's
office said today.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not say
when Bakker would be released from the federal prison at Butner.
   There was no immediate confirmation from Bakker's lawyers, who
are under a gag order imposed by U.S. District Judge Robert Potter.
Bakker is accused of fleecing followers of his PTL ministry and
could receive up to 120 years in prison.
   Potter on Thursday suspended Bakker's trial in Charlotte, N.C.,
and sent him to a prison mental ward for tests Thursday after
Bakker's psychiatrist testified he was hallucinating and cowering
under a couch.
   Jurors were not told how long the trial would be delayed.
   Tammy Bakker said in Orlando, Fla., today that her husband was
``so out of it'' when marshals came to take him to a mental ward
that he thought he was going to an animal hospital.
   But Mrs. Bakker told viewers of ``The Jim and Tammy Show'' that
her husband wasn't mentally unstable.
   ``After 2{ years of sheer mental torture, he just stressed out,''
she said.
   A crying Mrs. Bakker said the judge ``flew into a rage'' when
told Bakker couldn't come to court last week and ``ordered federal
marshals to seize him.''
   ``Jim's constitutional rights have been violated,'' she said.
``He has been treated like a carnival show.''
   She said U.S. marshals wouldn't tell Bakker where he was going
and that he overheard them talk about Butner and confused it with an
animal hospital called Butler.
   ``Jim was so out of it that he thought they were taking him to an
animal hospital,'' she said.
   On Sunday, a minister told a gathering of Bakker's followers that
the evangelist has endured unfair treatment in the prison
psychiatric wing, including strip searches, handcuffs and denial of
toilet paper.
   ``No matter what he has or has not done, it is unfair to give him
that type of treatment when he asked to go to the hospital,'' the
Rev. Roy Harthern told more than 100 people Sunday in the Bakker's
Orlando TV studio.
   Bryan Bledsoe, a spokesman at Butner, confirmed this morning that
Bakker had been handcuffed and strip searched, but said he was given
toilet paper.
   ``That is standard operating procedure for that unit,'' Bledsoe
said. He said Bakker was not given a pillow his first night there.
   ``It's standard in all these cases to first observe a person and
observe his condition before giving them something they may hurt
themselves with,'' he said.
   Dr. Basil Jackson, Bakker's psychiatrist, said Monday that he was
told Butner officials had stepped up their evaluation of Bakker.
   ``If that's true, then it's conceivable one of their people could
come back into court Tuesday or Wednesday to certify that he's ready
to come back into trial,'' he said.
   Prison officials said last week that because Bakker had not been
convicted of a crime, he would have the run of the prison grounds
and wear his own clothes.

   Army and civil defense medical teams rushed to

an exercise aimed at testing readiness to handle a terrorist attack.
   ``We've got 30 wounded in this area and others around here!''
shouted an army physician identified only as Dr. Haim, as ambulance
sirens wailed in the background. ``We're evacuating them to the
hospitals.''
   Israel radio broadcast from the scene, and the radio accounts
were so vivid that worried listeners phoned in, the radio said,
despite repeated broadcast warnings the reporters were describing an
exercise.
   According to the scenario, the car bomb exploded outside a Jewish
convention. The actual site was a supermarket parking lot.
   About 150 army recruits pretended to be victims, and another 50
people posed as doctors, who arrived at the scene in ambulances.

   The centrists of George Price, who led
Belize to self-government 25 years ago, defeated Prime Minister
Manuel Esquivel's conservative party, according to election results
announced Tuesday.
   Official results of Sunday's vote gave Price's Peoples United

   Both men won reelection. Price is expected to lead the new

   Price led the Central American nation of 160,000 people from
self-rule in 1964 through independence from Britain in 1981, until
Esquivel defeated him in the 1984 election.
   Esquivel campaigned on his record of economic recovery. Price
accused him of allowing foreigners too much influence in programs

   Once wasn't enough for former Swedish tennis
star Bjorn Borg and Italian pop singer Loredana Berte, who had two
weddings within 24 hours.
   First it was city hall. Then the two got to church on time for a
pastor, brought in from Switzerland to perform a Lutheran ceremony
Tuesday in a tiny downtown church.
   About 20 guests attended, church officials said, including Borg's
parents, his son Robin, and Adriano Panatta, the captain of the
Italian Davis Cup team.
   Borg, 32, a five-time Wimbledon champion, and the dark-haired
38-year-old singer arrived in separate automobiles. A party in a
downtown hotel completed the two-day wedding ceremonies.
   Borg was married previously to Romanian-born tennis player
Mariana Simionescu. The mother of his son is Janike Bjorling.
   Berte was previously married to Italian industrialist Roberto

   Harrison, who played Dr. Gonzo Gates on the early 1980s
television show ``Trapper John, M.D.,'' has a new role as celebrity
spokesman for the Entertainment Industry Referral &amp; Assistance
Center. The 5-year-old center has helped about 3,000 industry
workers seeking treatment for substance abuse.
   ``For four or five years it didn't harm me,'' Harrison said of
his early occasional drug use. ``But it's very insidious. It lets
you get away with it just enough time to be convinced you will
always get away with it.
   ``I felt more intelligent, more handsome, more creative, witty
and charming,'' Harrison, 39, said during a recent interview at his

convincing an illusion.''
   In August 1987, Harrison got into the car and drove from Los

   Waikiki entertainer Charo is being investigated
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for allegedly
importing illegal aliens to work at her restaurant.
   Charo, the Spanish singer best known for her ``cuchi-cuchi''
routine, called the allegations ``ridiculous.''
   ``I think the immigration department is using my name just for
publicity,'' she said.
   INS agents executed a search warrant last Thursday to look for
evidence at ``Charo's Restaurant'' on the island of Kauai.
   Arrangements for two Mexican aliens to come to Hawaii were made
in December in Charo's Beverly Hills, Calif., home, according to an
affidavit by Immigration Agent Dennis Smith.
   The two workers lived in a house adjacent to the restaurant, in a
remote area of the island, the affidavit said. It said another
illegal alien, a woman, worked at both the restaurant and in Charo's
home, about a mile from the restaurant.
   ``To the best of our knowledge, we were not hiring any illegal
aliens,'' said Bruce Lesher, her brother-in-law, who manages the
restaurant. ``Further than that, I have no comment.''

   What makes it hard to win a war on drugs is
that those who use them like them _ or need them _ and are willing
to go to criminal lengths to get them.
   They just won't say no. They don't want to be foot soldiers in
the home front battles of a war that can't seem to be won at the
borders.
   That's what George Bush confronts as the country turns with him
to the conclusion that the drug problem won't be solved as long as
people want drugs and will kill for them and die for them.
   Cocaine enters the country purer, cheaper, more plentiful and
more in demand than ever, even after decades of presidential
declarations of war.
   John F. Kennedy called a White House Conference on Drug Abuse in
1963, Richard M. Nixon ordered a ``concentrated assault on the
street-level heroin pusher'' in 1972, and Ronald Reagan said, ``Now
we're in another war for freedom'' in a television speech on drugs
in 1986.
   A few new things are working for this president as he summons the
country to battle again. Events may be creating the kind of iron
consensus that could, in the past, build battleships overnight and
right old wrongs.
   The drug deaths of actor John Belushi and basketball star Len
Bias shook their fans. The disgrace of Douglas H. Ginsburg,
distinguished lawyer, professor and judge _ his Supreme Court
nomination withdrawn following the disclosure that he had used
marijuana _ had a sobering message for middle-class, mortgage-owning
Americans.
   The polls show it. Drugs are going out of middle-class fashion.
   Cocaine was once considered glamorous and safe. Three years
before becoming Jimmy Carter's drug policy adviser, Dr. Peter Bourne
could say that cocaine was ``probably the most benign of illicit
drugs currently in widespread use.''
   A new government survey finds a 37 percent decrease since 1985 in
the number of people who said yes when asked if they had used
marijuana, cocaine or other illicit drugs in the previous month.
   A survey of college students found only 6 percent acknowledged
``occasional'' use of cocaine in 1988 _ almost half the level from
the previous year.
   A Gallup Poll, announced from the bully pulpit of the White House
last month, finds 27 percent of adults consider drugs the most
severe problem facing the country, worse than the threats of
recession, war or pollution.
   Playing into Bush's hands, too, are startling events in Colombia.
   President Virgilio Barco Vargas, facing a fierce blast of ``total
war'' declared by his country's drug lords, looked into the
television cameras last week and addressed Americans with an appeal
from the weak to the strong.
   He asked this country to give up drugs.
   He said he couldn't save his country unless Americans stopped
buying its most important export.
   ``What might seem to be a matter of purely personal habit has had
explosive public consequences,'' the besieged president said. ``It
has thrown us all into a war we did not ask for.''
   Anti-drug America may be in a mood to get tougher but not
tenderer. The country could be willing to hire more police, build
more prisons, send more aid to the drug-source countries, impose
tougher sentences.
   A benevolent country might even ante up the cost of treatment
programs for the afflicted. One recent analysis puts the number who
could benefit from drug-abuse treatment at 6.5 million and the
number of slots for them at 250,000.
   But the experts say more is needed. It is familiar turf: get to
the root causes, combat crumbling housing, joblessness, schools that
don't work, dropout rates, teen pregnancies, poverty, racism and
hopelessness.
   That doesn't look like an anti-drug agenda; there's not much sign
the country is willing to accept it as one or pay for it.
   If drugs become isolated as a problem of the inner city, separate
from a middle-class white society that finally came around to saying
no, that's going to be especially true.

   A subway train was mistakenly routed Tuesday
through an off-limits zone contaminated with asbestos, but
authorities said the 1,000 passengers were not endangered by the
hazardous substance.
   Up above on midtown Manhattan's Eighth Avenue, meanwhile, some
automobile traffic resumed Tuesday morning while workmen continued
repairing the broken water main that caused the weekend asbestos
emergency.
   Water from the break, which occurred early Sunday, had flushed
through the subway tunnels and carried with it asbestos insulation
from nearby Consolidated Edison steam pipes.
   The northbound avenue had been closed from 44th to 52nd streets
while contractors and city employees purged it of asbestos.
   The subway misadventure occurred at 7 a.m. Tuesday, the start of
the morning rush hour, when a Transit Authority tower operator
failed to switch a southbound train from its normal route under
Eighth Avenue over to the tracks of the Sixth Avenue line after it
passed 59th Street.
   The motorman found himself on tracks without power but, because
the tunnel south of 59th Street is downhill, was able to coast to
42nd Street, said TA spokesman Bob Slovak.
   The riders were evacuated at the closed 42nd Street station. That
station had not yet been cleaned up, Slovak said, but it was safe
because ``the asbestos is still on the track, still wet, so there
are no airborne particles yet.''
   Inhaled particles of asbestos may cause cancer.
   It took two days of intensive cleaning to clear asbestos from a
half-mile of the surface of Eighth Avenue. It could take that much
time or longer just to get bids and plans from contractors to clean
the train tunnel and stations, said Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard.
   Con Edison, which had to turn off steam service because of the
flooding, said eight of 20 steam customers in the area got their
power back at 3 a.m. Tuesday. One of the restored customers was St.
Clare's Hospital, which had lost its hot water.
   It is not yet possible to estimate the cleanup cost, city and Con
Ed spokesmen have said.
   A Con Edison steam line on East 20th Street in southern Manhattan
ruptured Aug. 19, killing three people and contaminating Gramercy
Park apartment buildings with a mud-and-asbestos bath.
   With no probable completion date in sight, the cleanup bill for
Gramercy Park already has risen into the millions of dollars for Con
Edison, spokesman Martin Gitten said. The utility faces claims for
damage and temporary housing from some 500 area residents who had to
leave their homes.

   An aircraft mechanic Tuesday stole an F-16
jet fighter he was untrained to fly and crashed it into a vacant
farm minutes after taking off from an air base, the military said.
He was missing and believed dead.
   The aircraft exploded in the crash, engulfing a farm building in
a fireball, said Lt. Col. Svein Fredriksen of Norway's Oerland Air
Force Base, from where the plane was taken. There was no reports of
injuries to anyone on the ground.
   Rescue helicopters found no sign the Belgian mechanic ejected,
but search crews found no trace of him at the crash site, Fredriksen
said. The identity of the mechanic was being withheld until his
remains were found and his family notified, the officer said.
   It was not clear if the mechanic accidentally or intentionally
crashed.
   Fredriksen said the jet motor specialist plunged to the ground in
the single-seat Belgian plane nine miles from the coastal Oerland
base, west of the city of Trondheim.
   ``The impact point is nothing but a hole in the ground. We are
looking for physical evidence that he was actually in the plane ....
There is nothing left,'' said air force Major Amund Sveen.
   The mechanic was taking a training course for NATO F-16 crews
from Norway, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands, Fredriksen said.
   ``The technician did not have permission or training to fly the
F-16. You could say he stole it. We don't know if he had any other
kind of flight training,'' said Fredriksen.
   ``We have no idea what he was up to. An aircraft mechanic is not
trained as a pilot and can't control one of these fighters. They
know how to start the motors to check them and can maybe even taxi,
but they don't have a chance after takeoff,'' said Fredriksen.
   Sveen said the mechanic had taxied the jet onto the runway, taken
off, and managed to reach about 2,000 feet of elevation before
crashing.
   He said fighter pilot training lasts more than two years and that
it ``is madness'' for untrained personnel to try flying an F-16.
   The technician had no contact with the control tower and was
wearing improper equipment, a defense spokesman told the Norwegian
news agency NTB.
   A team of 10 Belgian military investigators were on their way to
the accident site. They were to investigate with Norwegian
officials, Sveen said.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Kill 16 Soldiers in Major Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas and
government forces battled in a northeastern province Tuesday,
leaving at least 16 soldiers dead in one of the civil war's fiercest
battles in more than two years.
   Armed Forces spokesmen reported the deaths of the soldiers after
the pre-dawn fighting outside Chilanga in Morazan province. In an
official statement, they said the rebels also suffered ``numerous
casualties'' but gave no number.
   The official death toll was the highest since the armed forces
acknowledged 69 soldiers killed in a guerrilla attack March 31,
1987, on the 4th Army Brigade headquarters in the northern province
of Chalatenango.
   The rebels, on their clandestine Radio Venceremos, said Tuesday
their forces inflicted 25 casualties, including dead and wounded, on
government forces outside Chilanga.
   However, the military said the government forces suffered six
wounded, for a total of 22 casualties in three hours of fighting.
   The nearly decade-old civil war has killed an estimated 70,000
people.
   The rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani, who took
office June 1, says it wants to talk with the rebels about ending
the war. The guerrillas also say they want peace talks, but the
mechanism and agenda for such dialogue has yet to be worked out.
   Also Tuesday, an anti-tank rocket smashed into the headquarters
of a leftist labor federation before dawn. The missile damaged the
facade of the San Salvador headquarters of the group, known as
Fenastras, but it caused no casualties.
   Gerardo Diaz, the group's secretary general, blamed the armed
forces for the attack.
   ``This is a provocation that is part of a generalized campaign
against the organized labor movement,'' he said.
   The government and armed forces consider Fenastras and several
other left-of-center unions, peasant groups, and human rights
organizations to be guerrilla fronts.

   Hundreds of thousands of blacks
angered at being shut out of national elections walked off their
jobs Tuesday, the biggest show of defiance in a monthlong campaign
to discredit the balloting.
   The National Party, despite gains made by white leftist and
rightist forces, expects to retain power in Wednesday's
parliamentary voting, but it probably will suffer its biggest losses
since coming to power 41 years ago.
   Hundreds rallied at universities and barricaded streets with
flaming tires around the country to protest the elections, and
police arrested 500 people. Witnesses said police used tear gas,
whips, rubber bullets and birdshot to break up demonstrations.
   The protests were the latest in a mass campaign launched a month
ago to defy apartheid laws that segregate the society and to protest
the elections that exclude the country's 28 million blacks.
   ``The elections are addressing irrelevancies,'' said Titus
Mafolo, a leader of the defiance campaign. ``Once more the ruling
bloc is going to elections, and ... the main concern is the
protection of white affluence and privilege.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said: ``We condemn South Africa's system of racial segregation and
urge the South African government to permit peaceful expression of
political dissent.''
   More than 3 million of the country's 5 million whites have
registered to vote, as well as 1.7 million mixed-race people and
665,000 Indians. Some black leaders have called for boycotts of the
mixed-race and Indian voting because their respective houses have no
power to overrule the white chamber of Parliament.
   For the first time since 1953, political analysts predict the
Nationalists could receive less than half the white vote.
   The party currently has 123 seats in the 166-seat white House of
Assembly.
   The extent of their loss _ and the relative gains made by the
right-wing Conservatives and the anti-apartheid Democrats _ will
affect the government's pace of reform during the next five years.
   ``It is widely acknowledged that the general election is the most
crucial in the recent history of South Africa,'' government-run
radio said Tuesday. ``The changes that await South Africans will be
fundamental and, perhaps decisive for the course of events in future
generations.''
   National Party leader F.W. de Klerk, who became acting president
in the midst of the campaign when the Cabinet forced President P.W.
Botha to retire Aug. 14, has campaigned as a new leader with a new
vision.
   ``Our generation's greatest test has come,'' de Klerk said in his
final campaign speech Monday.
   ``Our action lays the basis for a new South Africa, in which all
can achieve their rights, without domination or injustice,'' he said.
   The Nationalists' campaign manifesto calls for negotiations with
black leaders on a new constitution and government, providing
limited black participation in national affairs within five years,
but with protection against loss of white power.
   The National Party concedes its policies could lose it up to 32
parliamentary seats, chiefly to the Conservative Party. The
Conservative Party currently has 22 seats and the Democrats have 20.
One seat belongs to the defunct New Republic Party.
   The Conservatives say negotiation with blacks will lead
inevitably to black majority rule with whites being dominated. They
call for complete separation of the races into different nations
within South African territory.
   The Democratic Party, expected to finished third, wants apartheid
laws scrapped immediately.
   Although the Democrats do not expect to win, co-leader Denis
Worrall said, ``A good performance by the Democratic Party will
boost international confidence in the country ... and send a message
to our fellow black South Africans.''
   Organizers said Tuesday's general strike, most effective among
black students and union members in the port cities of Cape Town,
Durban and East London, would expand Wednesday.
   In Durban, on the Indian Ocean, some industries reported all
black workers stayed home Tuesday. The giant Putco bus company said
it experienced a total strike of black staff and passengers in
Durban and other parts of Natal Province.
   Commuter trains from the outlying townships into Cape Town and
Johannesburg carried about 60 percent to 75 percent of their normal
passenger loads, transportation officials said. Police said there
was a 25 percent absentee rate in mostly rural Orange Free State.
   The National Union of Mineworkers, the country's largest union,
said 78,000 members at 16 mines refused to work Tuesday morning.
   Police used whips and dogs to break up a demonstration by 700
people at the University of Stellenbosch, alma mater of many
government leaders. Thirty students were arrested and several people
beaten, human rights lawyers said.
   Youths set tires ablaze to block streets in townships outside
Durban and in Soweto. Police said they used rubber bullets, birdshot
and tear gas against stonethrowers in Durban and Cape Town. They
said one black youth was injured by birdshot and arrested.
   At the multiracial University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg,
police arrested about 300 participants at an anti-election
demonstration, including students, administrators and Franciscan
monks.
   ``There is something terribly wrong with those who rule us if
they cannot understand why such protest is occurring,'' said Colin
Webb, the white vice principal of the university.
   About 500 slogan-chanting activists in Lenasia, an Indian
community near Johannesburg, burned effigies of de Klerk and the
leaders of Indian and mixed-race chambers of Parliament. Fireworks
exploded from the effigies, which were doused with gasoline.

   All 26,790 New York City police officers will be
subject to random drug testing, the police commissioner announced
Tuesday.
   ``The goal of random testing is to have a drug free
environment,'' Commissioner Benjamin Ward said in a statement. ``I
believe that this expanded drug testing program will further promote
that environment and provide a deterrent to the use of illegal
drugs.''
   The new policy excludes civilian employees of the Police
Department. The department now requires random drug tests only of
the 2,000 officers in the Narcotics Division. Applicants for the
Detective Division and the Organized Crime Control Bureau are also
tested, but not at random.
   Other officers can be tested based on administrative or medical
cause.
   Under the new program, all officers' Social Security numbers will
be entered into a computer, which will select some at random for
each test. The officers chosen will have 24 hours notice of the test.
   Ward, who was in Washington, was not available to comment on the
policy change.
   Phil Caruso, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association,
which represents police officers, was also not immediately available
for comment, spokesman Joe Mancini said.
   During 1988, 3,946 police officers were tested, with 37 officers
testing positive. This year, through July, 2,220 police officers
were tested with 23 testing positive.
   Random drug tests are also required of candidates for police
officer as well as police recruits at the Police Academy, and at the
completion of their probationary period.
   It is expected that additional staffing will be necessary to
administer the program and the lab costs of the drug testing are
estimated at $31,000 per year.

   Marine experts were making an artificial
nurser Tuesday to feed a baby whale that washed up on a beach over
the weekend.
   The 900-pound sperm whale was ``not getting any worse, but not
getting any better,'' said Cheryl Snyder, senior trainer at
Sea-Arama Marineworld. ``He's holding his own.''
   The whale, estimated to be no more than 2 weeks old, was found
ashore Saturday on the Bolivar Peninsula. When volunteers from the
Texas Mammal Stranding Network couldn't find his mother, the 12-foot
whale was hoisted onto a flatbed truck, smeared with zinc oxide
sunscreen, wet down and brought to the marine park.
   Park personnel, after consulting experts from other marine parks
around the country, were devising an artificial nurser to feed the
whale.
   ``It's not yet put together, but it will be a collapsible bottle
with a nipple set up and a pump to force the milk out,'' according
to Sea-Arama spokeswoman Christy Benson. The plastic device is
modeled after an apparatus used at Marineland of California.
   The whale, dubbed Odie, has been fed formula every four hours
since Monday night via a stomach feeding tube. Officials were
optimistic the whale would take to the nurser.
   ``We're getting a very strong suckling reponse,'' Snyder said.
``He's sucking hands or anything that comes in his mouth.''
   Snyder cautioned, however, that survival statistics for a
stranded whale were very low.
   A sperm whale will nurse for six months after birth. The formula
Odie is being fed is made from a milk powder that contains no
lactose, which marine mammals are not capable of digesting.
   If Odie survives, he will be released when he begins feeding on
whole foods, which would not be for several months. By then he
likely would double in size.
   The whale is being kept in a tank in three to four feet of water.
   ``He's able to float and hold himself in the water,'' Ms. Snyder
said. ``His equilibrium is off. Volunteers are in the water with him
24 hours a day. They gently hold on to him to keep his blow hole
above water.''
   The discovery of a whale on the Texas coast is quite rare. Since
1984, only two whales have been found. Both died.

   A judge rejected a mistrial motion by Richard
Ramirez's lawyers Tuesday while the jury in his ``Night Stalker''
murder trial began its 13th day of deliberations on 43 charges.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan also denied a motion to
disqualify jurors for allegedly disobeying court instructions.
   Attorneys for Ramirez claimed the panelists were obviously
watching TV or reading news accounts when one juror was murdered
last month. Several arrived at the courthouse in tears. The defense
said this showed they had disobeyed an order to avoid exposure to
publicity.
   Attorneys also claimed that the murder prejudiced jurors and made
their deliberations unfair to the defendant.
   Tynan ruled on the written motions without hearing arguments.
   Ramirez, 29, a drifter from El Paso, Texas, who is accused of
being the devil-worshiping ``Night Stalker,'' made a brief court
appearance to acknowledge he did not want to attend the court
session. He answered ``yes,'' when asked whether he understood his
right to be there, then signed a waiver of his presence.
   Tynan said the jury, which began its deliberations anew after the
panel member died, has asked to review videotape evidence in the
case on Wednesday. He said he would send a video player into their
jury room.
   The tapes in evidence show a police lineup in which victims
identified Ramirez as the attacker who murdered, raped and robbed
victims in a string of nighttime attacks during the summer of 1985.
   Defense attorneys have claimed that witnesses were coached to
pick Ramirez out. They contend he is a victim of mistaken
identifications.
   The prosecution has said the evidence linking Ramirez to the
terrifying attacks is overwhelming.
   The jury had already deliberated 13 days when it was required to
restart its talks on Aug. 11 because one juror had been sleeping and
was dismissed.
   They had barely begun when word came on Aug. 14 that juror
Phyllis Singletary was found beaten and shot to death. Her boyfriend
later took his own life. He left a note saying he killed her in a
domestic argument.
   After a recess for jurors to recover from the shock, an alternate
was sent in and the panel began talking again Aug. 16.

<HEAD>Talk of Illegal Escape, Protest Abounds Among East Germans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East Germans who had hoped to go West
legally said Tuesday they make risk an illegal dash across the
border unless red tape that has stranded them in makeshift refugee
camps is unraveled soon.
   The mood in the five camps housing about 5,000 East Germans in
Budapest and on the shores of Lake Balaton grew somber, even
desperate, after Hungarian officials said it might be weeks before
they can move legally to West Germany.
   ``When are you going back to Austria?'' an East German woman in
her 30s asked a reporter near the Csilleberc refugee camp in
Budapest. ``I haven't tried crossing over on my own, but if the
standoff continues much longer, I might just ask you to take me with
you and drop me off near the border.''
   She added, ``I'm serious.''
   Those who are caught could end up with a stamp on their papers
showing they tried an illegal escape, exposing them to punishment on
return to their hard-line Communist homeland.
   About 30 East Germans in one Budapest camp announced they would
start a hunger strike Friday if not given permission to cross the
border.
   ``The situation is desperate,'' a 23-year-old identifying himself
only as Rene told reporters outside Budapest's Zugliget refugee camp.
   ``We wanted to start fasting two weeks ago, but we didn't because
we didn't want to hurt the Hungarians,'' he said, adding that now
some East Germans feel they have no choice but to protest.
   Last week, West German and Austrian officials suggested Hungarian
authorities would allow the East Germans to leave by the end of that
week. They would have been received at the Hungarian-Austrian border
and transported to West Germany.
   However, disillusionment flooded the camps Monday when Interior
Minister Istvan Horvath was quoted by the West German weekly Stern
as saying it might be weeks before Bonn and East Berlin resolved the
refugee crisis.
   On Tuesday, senior Foreign Ministry official Ferenc Somogy of
Hungary reiterated that ``a final solution could take days, even
weeks.''
   Hungary and East Germany are allies in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
alliance. However, reform-minded Communist authorities in Hungary
began removing barriers on their border with Austria in May and
created a crush of East German refugees trying to cross to the West.
   About 6,000 East Germans have rushed across the border since
then. The wave of escapes peaked in late August, but it has dwindled
to a trickle since Hungary stepped up border patrols.
   East Germans by the hundreds also gathered this summer to demand
asylum at West German diplomatic buildings in Budapest; East Berlin;
and Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   Some say they are fleeing the rigid Communist system in their
homeland, and others are seeking economic opportunity.
   Under a 1969 agreement with East Berlin, Hungary is obliged to
send home any East Germans who try to escape. However, Budapest's
reformist government seems willing to break that accord in a new
commitment to human rights.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf
Seiters, was quoted in an interview Tuesday as saying it was
Hungary's ``duty'' to allow the refugees to leave.
   However, West German government and Red Cross officials said they
had no information on when Hungary might let the refugees depart.
   The Hungarian attempt to win at least grudging acceptance from
East Germany seems to have delayed, if not blocked the exodus.
   East Germany wants to win back some of the thousands of mostly
young, skilled workers who are turning their back on their homeland.
   Despite the delays, most of the East Germans seemed determined
Tuesday to wait it out.
   ``No way we are going back, no way,'' said a 31-year-old East
German playing with his 6-year-old son behind the iron fence topped
with barbed wire at Csilleberc, the largest Budapest camp.
   ``Better dead than red,'' he said, ``but even better out of here
as soon as possible.''

<DATELINE>NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ethnic and racial dispute with
neighboring Senegal that left hundreds dead last spring is flaring
up again with threats of open warfare between the two nations.
   Officials in both West African capitals have invited Egypt's
President Hosni Mubarak, president of the Organization of African
Unity, to mediate the conflict. He will visit both countries
beginning Wednesday with a stop in Nouakchott, Mauritania's capital.
   Mubarak has his hands full. When Senegal and Mauritania broke
diplomatic relations Aug. 22, Foreign Minister Ibrahim Fall of
Senegal said the situation ``constitutes a threat to peace in the
entire region.''
   Fall said Senegal was ready ``to use all means to defend its
territorial integrity, its sovereignty and its independence.'' But
Senegal has denied Mauritanian charges that it was massing troops at
the border for a military offensive.
   Information Minister Mohamed Lemine Ould Ahmed of Mauritania said
in a recent interview that the dispute stems from ``a Senegalese
plot to dominate Mauritania.'' However, he did not provide proof.
   Farmers from Senegal and nomadic herdsmen from Mauritania have
clashed for centuries.
   The latest trouble began in April, when a herd of goats strayed
across the ill-defined border. Farmers and herdsmen fought over the
goats, and two Senegalese were killed.
   Tempers exploded in both countries. In the snowballing conflict,
hundreds of people were murdered in riots in Nouakchott, Senegal's
capital of Dakar, and other cities.
   In addition, thousands of Mauritanian and Senegalese expatriates
were forced to flee. About 200,000 refugees are now living in camps
on both sides of the border.
   Blaise Cherif, of the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said it was the first time his office has had to cope with
such a massive influx of refugees anywhere in West Africa.
   The conflict has pitted mainly Arabic-speaking Mauritanian Moors
against largely French-speaking Senegalese blacks. About a third of
Mauritania's 1.7 million people are black, but not all the blacks
attacked by mobs in this country have been of Senegalese origin.
   President Abdou Diouf of Senegal has said the cause of the
trouble is the determination of Mauritania's Moorish majority to
``Arabize'' their country. Most blacks in Mauritania do not speak
Arabic, and many blacks accuse the government of racism.
   The dispute is complicated by the changing course of the Senegal
River, has divided the two lands since France ruled them both.
   Mauritania says the border lies in the middle of the river.
   However, when the river floods, its shore moves north by 20 to 30
miles over a 580-mile stretch. About 18,000 square miles of fertile
land thus remain in dispute.

<HEAD>Argentina Asks for Cut in Britain's Falkland Garrison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina wants Britain to make major troop
reductions in the Falkland Islands as part of an agreement to
normalize relations, Senate President Eduardo Menem of Argentina
said Tuesday.
   Menem, brother of President Carlos Menem, also told a news
conference he believes negotiations in Madrid next month will lead
Britain and Argentina to restore diplomatic relations.
   Diplomatic ties were severed during the 1982 Falkland Islands
war, when Britain drove Argentine invaders from the South Atlantic
archipelago.
   ``Demilitarization means only one thing,'' Menem said. ``Of
course, it is a reduction of forces in the area. I think there is a
consensus for making the South Atlantic an area of peace.'
   Menem was in London for a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union, a 108-nation conference of legislators. He shook hands and
chatted with Queen Elizabeth II on Monday when she opened the
meeting.
   Since taking office two months ago, his brother has initiated
peace overtures toward Britain, including ending an economic embargo
this week.
   Britain maintains a military garrison in the islands, as well as
fighter aircraft and Rapier missiles, to guard the 1,600 British
inhabitants.
   The Defense Ministry refused Tuesday to give the current strength
of the garrison. British newspapers say it is down to about 1,000
troops, about one-fourth the earlier size, because Britain is
confident Argentina will not attack again.
   The Madrid talks are expected to focus on fishing rights and
restoring air links between Argentina and the islands.
   Many observers believe Argentina wants to patch up the
differences because Britain is a key member of the European Economic
Community. The 12-nation community is due to drop remaining trade
barriers and become a single market in 1992.
   Senator Menen said Argentina ``never put economic considerations
in the forefront in our consideration of this subject.'' He added,
``But if through this we manage to establish good commercial
relations, then be it welcome.''

   Five endangered Philippine crocodiles
that hatched Tuesday at the Gladys Porter Zoo are believed to be the
first to hatch away from the Philippines, a scientist said.
   Two more were trying to break out of their shells Tuesday
afternoon, said Pat Burchfield, a herpetologist and deputy director
of the zoo.
   There are only 400 to 500 Philippine crocodiles in the wild. The
species, known scientifically as Crocodylus mindorensis, has
declined because of human encroachment on their habitat, Burchfield
said.
   The olive green, 8}-inch-long babies hatched from 13 eggs laid at
the zoo 73 days before, he said.
   The zoo had only two males until last year, Burchfield said, when
it acquired two females with the help of Charles Ross of the
Smithsonian Institution and A.C. Alcala of Silliman University in
the Philippines.
   Some of the baby crocodiles probably will be sent back to a
breeding program at Silliman University, Burchfield said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, in what he previewed as a
``heart-to-heart talk with the American people,'' tonight will urge
a crackdown on illegal drug users and declare a $7.9 billion war on
drugs.
   The White House this afternoon released Bush's national antidrug
strategy, disclosing plans to increase this year's authorization by
$2.2 billion, or 39 percent to reach the $7.9 billion.
   The plan would authorize $1.6 billion for corrections; $449 for
interdiction on the international level, including some $260 for
military aid to the drug-production countries of Peru, Bolivia and
Colombia; $350 million for state and local law enforcement; $250
million for expanding the court system; $3.1 billion for other law
enforcement; $1.2 billion for prevention and education; and $925
million for treatment.
   Officials have not said where Bush will siphon off money from an
already squeezed federal budget to pay for his war on drugs.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., after meeting today with
Bush, said the president revealed that $720 million would be
funnelled from other programs to pay for part of the drug package.
   Sources have said the funds will come from various categories in
next year's budget rather than cutting back in one or two places.
   ``There's no question but that drugs are (the) quicksand of our
entire society. They're suffocating individuals and families and
institutions as well. And all Americans must pull together to solve
this problem,'' Bush said at the outset of a Cabinet meeting today.
   Bush will talk about the war on drugs tonight in his first prime
time televised address to the nation as president, scheduled for 9
p.m. EDT.
   ``My speech will be the basis of a heart-to-heart talk with the
American people,'' he said today.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said it would be ``a
personal message from himself to the American people that talks
about the collective need of society to pull together to solve this
problem.''
   In what the White House billed as a practice session this morning
for a 22-minute speech, the president quipped to photographers that,
``I have it memorized. I don't need TelePrompTers.''
   Bush will ``talk considerably about users and the need to crack
down on them and who they are and why this is such a pervasive
problem in our society,'' Fitzwater said Monday.
   The president discussed his drug plan with Cabinet members and
members of Congress, and was joining drug policy chief William
Bennett in a meeting with groups involved in fighting drugs,
including law enforcement, education and rehabilitation experts.
   Just back from a three-week vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine,
Bush rehearsed his speech Monday afternoon and went over last-minute
refinements of the text. He got tips on delivery and style from his
campaign media adviser, Roger Ailes.
   All four major television networks _ ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN _ plan
to broadcast the speech, which will be carried from the Oval Office.
   The speech will outline the national drug strategy put together
over several months by Bennett, with assistance from advisers across
the government. The strategy has been billed as a coordinated effort
to link the drug-fighting programs by various government agencies in
a more cohesive way than has been seen in the past.
   Bush's package for 1990 will be close to $2 billion above the
current anti-drug spending levels.
   In his televised address, the president will dwell more on a
general outline of his strategy than on its cost specifics. The
White House planned to release those figures to the media today.
   Bush will urge Americans ``to think about what drugs are doing to
our society, and the many ramifications that they have for other
social programs,'' such as housing, medical care and education,
Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said the speech would be ``an expression of the
magnitude of the problem, what it takes to deal with it, what can we
expect, how long it will take.''
   Among the details that have emerged is that Bush will earmark
some $260 million in economic and military aid to the three main
cocaine producers, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. The final figure
could go higher, administration sources have said.
   Bush already is sending $65 million worth of helicopters and
military aid to Colombia to help President Virgilio Barco wage his
war against the powerful drug lords.
   Bush would like to send U.S. troops to join the crackdown,
according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, but
Barco has said he does not want such intervention from the United
States.
   Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, hinted strongly Sunday that
Bush would dispatch the troops if Barco asked.
   ``If that request ever came in, I'm sure the president would
recognize that the American public thinks that the drug problem is
so tough and so important that there is a great feeling among
American citizens that we probably should take even that risk,''
Sununu said in a CBS television interview.
   The administration says the anti-drug plan will focus mostly on
the domestic front, however.
   It is expected to impose tougher penalties on drug users, pour
more money into treatment for addicts and give more money to state
and local law enforcement efforts.
   Bennett, whose job was created by order of Congress, said casual
drug users will be targeted with calls for more arrests, seizures of
personal property and more widespread drug testing.
   One idea that Bush decided against, according to sources, was
withholding federal highway funds or other federal money from states
that did not enact tough enough laws, such as revoking the drivers'
licenses of convicted drug offenders.

   Five hooded Shining Path guerrillas took a
high school teacher from his classroom Tuesday as he was giving a
lecture and shot him to death on the school grounds, police said.
   The incident occurred at the Tupac Amaru high school in the
Chilca suburb of Huancayo, 140 miles east of Lima. Two weeks ago,
the Maoist rebels sacked offices and burned records at the school.
   Police said the teacher, Eloy Cangahuala, 25, was a former
soldier hired to give courses in pre-military training.
   The rebels threatened students and other teachers before fleeing,
police said.

<HEAD>Haig Says Bush Must Move Quickly If He Is to Balance Budget</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush ``missed the boat'' on deficit
reduction in the early days of his administration and will have to
act quickly to increase revenues and make deep cuts in social
programs if he is to make the government solvent, Alexander M. Haig
Jr. said in an interview released Tuesday.
   Haig, former secretary of state in the Reagan administration and
a contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988, told
Penthouse magazine he hopes to be campaigning for Bush for a second
term in 1992.
   In the interview, to be published in the magazine's October
issue, Haig responded to a question about domestic policy by saying
that ``the most important thing ... is the deficit.''
   ``I think Mr. Bush missed the boat,'' he said. ``It was probably
his worst mistake in the early days of the administration.''
   Haig said he believed Bush made ``a conscious decision to avoid
biting the necessary bullet on the deficit, in order to try to
structure a bipartisan coalition for the major issues facing our
country .''
   He said recent events including ``ethical extremism'' in Congress
``have derailed the coalition and will continue to do so, so he has
now run out of time for negotiations on the 1990 budget.''
   ``He is faced with the imperative of putting in place a credible
five-year program to bring the United States to solvency,'' he said.
``Now that's going to require some additional revenue _ but remember
the `read my lips' problem?''
   Bush repeatedly used the phrase ``read my lips'' during the
campaign to emphasize his commitment not to raise taxes.
   In addition, said Haig, a deficit-reduction program ``will
require a very austere approach to some of the social programs,
including the so-called fenced-off areas _ indexing of Social
Security, perhaps.''
   ``These are very difficult steps for any president who wants a
second term to take,'' Haig said. ``If he had done it in the first
six months, the consequences of it could have been behind him. He
could still do it at the end of 1989. If he waits any longer than
that, it would be asking a politican to do something which
politicians are simply unable to do, and that is commit political
suicide.''
   Haig was asked whether he might be interested in the presidency
in 1992 if Bush, for any reason, did not run.
   ``I doubt it,'' he said.
   Asked if that meant another bid for the White House was out of
the question, he said, ``Yep. I'm a Republican ... I hope I'll be
campaigning for George Bush's second term in 1992.''

<TEXT>
   Chile, which has had no diplomatic
relations with the Soviet Union since Gen. Augusto Pinochet came to
power in a 1973 coup, filed a protest with the Soviets, claiming
their trawlers have been fishing illegally in Chilean waters, the
Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
   Ministry spokesman Carlo Ducci said the protest was relayed
Monday to the Soviet embassy in Lima, Peru, by the Peruvian
government. The text of the protest was not disclosed.
   Chile has frequently complained in recent months over Soviet
trawlers allegedly violating its territorial Pacific waters to fish
in the far south.
   Last Aug. 24, the navy delivered to local newspapers a series of
pictures that it said showed four Soviet trawlers making illegal
catches in southern Chilean waters.
   The navy said in the future that it will take ``drastic
measures'' against those trawlers, including seizing the vessels.

   A seventh-grader was removed from class and
arrested Tuesday for bringing a gun to school, authorities said.
   Marion County Sheriff's Department dispatcher Rick McGuire said
the 14-year-old boy was taken to the juvenile center. The exact
charges against him were not known.
   Terry Dorman, assistant principal at Keystone Middle School, said
the revolver was found Friday in a jacket that was left in a
classroom. On Tuesday, school officials discovered the jacket
belonged to the seventh-grader and called the sheriff's department,
Dorman said.
   Once the student returns to school, ``there will be some
discipline that will have to be administered,'' he said, but that
had not been determined Tuesday.
   ``He told us he felt like he needed it for protection in his
community,'' Dorman said. The boy, who is new at school this year,
is from an inner city area and is bused to the suburban school,
Dorman said. School began Aug. 23.
   Dorman said nothing was said to the other students about the
incident.

<HEAD>Chicago Lawyer to Prosecute Poindexter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. attorney from Chicago will
prosecute former national security adviser John Poindexter in the
Iran-Contra case, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh announced
Tuesday.
   No trial date has been set.
   Dan K. Webb, Walsh's choice to be chief trial counsel against
Poindexter, oversaw the federal corruption investigation of the Cook
County, Ill., judicial system known as Operation Greylord.
   As a U.S. attorney from 1981 to 1985, Webb also won convictions
in the Tylenol extortion case and the case in which 10 Chicago
police officers were convicted of taking payoffs from heroin dealers.
   Webb, 43, is a partner in the Chicago law firm of Winston &amp;
Strawn specializing in commercial litigation and white-collar
criminal defense.
   On another matter Tuesday, Walsh's office disclosed that it had
spent $15.9 million through the end of July to investigate and
prosecute the Iran-Contra affair.
   There have been three guilty pleas as well as the conviction of
Oliver North in the case since Walsh was appointed in December 1986.
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy and two counts of
obstructing Congress and two counts of making false statements. He
is accused of telling Congress that no one in the U.S. government
knew until 1986 that a 1985 shipment to Iran contained Hawk
missiles. He also is accused of conspiring to cover up North's
assistance to the Contras during a a congressional ban on military
aid to the Nicaraguan rebel force.
   North, a former National Security Council aide, was convicted in
May of aiding and abetting an obstruction of Congress, destroying
NSC documents and accepting an illegal gratuity from Richard Secord.
North, who was sentenced to 1,200 hours of community service, is
appealing his convictions.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leaders said the foreign and
transport ministeries, both sought by the Communists, remained under
discussion but that Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's Cabinet list
should be complete Wednesday.
   As the makeup is described by various sources, Solidarity would
hold the most portfolios, followed by the Communists and the United
Peasant Party and Democratic Party.
   Bronislaw Geremek, Solidarity leader in Parliament, said the
Solidarity caucus would meet with Mazowiecki on Thursday and the
final list of Cabinet nominees would be presented to Mikolaj
Kozakiewicz, speaker of the parliament, or Sejm.
   In an interview with the state news agency PAP, Kozakiewicz said
the Sejm was scheduled to meet Sept. 12 to vote on the Cabinet.
   Kozakiewicz said hearings by parliamentary commissions on the
nominees would start Friday and last three days. ``I hope that no
complications will surface,'' he said.
   Sixteen government ministries are to be filled, but the number
could change if Mazowiecki decides to combine or split up
departments.
   Mazowiecki, a Solidarity newspaper editor elected prime minister
Aug. 24, met with leaders of the Peasant Party Democratic Party on
Tuesday.
   Jerzy Jozwiak, leader of the Democratic Party, told PAP after the
meeting that his party would receive four posts: a deputy prime
minister, domestic trade, the office for scientific-technological
progress and a ministry yet to be decided.
   Asked if his party was satisfied, Jozwiak replied: ``The number,
yes; the arrangement, not much.'' He did not elaborate.
   Peasant Party leader Roman Malinowski and the party's
parliamentary leader, Aleksander Bentkowski, met with Mazowiecki.
Bentkowski said later the party would receive five posts to be held
by four people: a deputy prime minister and the ministries of
agriculture, environment, health and justice. The deputy prime
minister also would be the agriculture minister, he said.
   Bentkowski said he was satisfied ``because we received what the
prime minister promised to us earlier.''
   Geremek said not only ministries are being balanced by
negotiations, but in some cases subordinate positions in ministries.
   For instance, Geremek said, if the Communists get the foreign
minister, the undersecretary of the ministry would be someone from
Solidarity.
   The Communists have pressed for Foreign Minister Tadeusz
Olechowski, the incumbent, to be retained.
   Geremek said the ministry overseeing state broadcasting probably
would be controlled by Solidarity.
   ``Radio and television should not be a party man, and he probably
will have a staff composed of representatives of different political
orientations,'' Geremek said. ``We want the television to be
pluralistic.''
   The pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza quoted Communist
Central Committee secretary Slawomir Wiatr on Tuesday as saying the
party expects five ministries.
   In addition to the defense and interior ministries, originally
promised the Communists, Wiatr said the party expected foreign
affairs, culture and transportation. The Communists have threatened
to oppose Mazowiecki if they are not satisfied with the makeup of
his government.
   Solidarity activists believe an aggressive stance by the party
would hurt Mazowiecki's government as it seeks to carry out painful
economic reforms.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Monday: ``Poland belongs to
everybody. ... If Poland is to be reformed, then (Communists) have
to enter the government as reformers, and not as party members. They
should think about Poland and reform, and not about the number of
seats that fall to them.''

   The Communist Party chief of Azerbaijan has called
for an end to direct rule from Moscow in the republic's troubled
Nagorno-Karabakh region, which neighboring Armenia also claims, an
activist said Tuesday.
   Sources in Azerbaijan and Moldavia said strikes spawned by
disputes between rival ethnic groups in the two southern republics
spread to more factories and businesses.
   Aiden Amirbekov, the Azerbaijani activist, quoted party leader
Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov as saying in the television interview at
midnight Monday: ``We must liquidate the special form of
administration.''
   Taking that position would align the Communist leader of the
Caucasus republic against the Kremlin on the issue and with the
People's Front political movement, which organized the general
strike that began Monday.
   Vezirov and other Azerbaijani leaders refuse to recognize the
People's Front, which called the strike to demand that the
republic's national legislators be recalled and that it reassert
control over Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Amirbekov quoted Vezirov as saying nothing had been accomplished
by the direct rule of Kremlin representative Arkady Volsky, imposed
Jan. 12 in an effort to stop violence between ethnic Azerbaijanis
and Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Krasnaya Zvezda, the Defense Ministry newspaper, said Sunday the
disputed territory was on the verge of civil war and tensions
between Azerbaijanis and Armenians ``are like gunpowder.''
   In a 20-minute television interview, Vezirov also criticized the
strike as damaging to Azerbaijan and its relationship with other
republics, Amirbekov said.
   Amirbekov said Vezirov's comments would be discussed at a
People's Front rally Wednesday evening.
   Javad Salamov, a strike committee member, claimed Tuesday that 95
percent of Baku's factories were closed, but a journalist at the
republic's official news agency said the number was far lower.
   Salamov claimed public transport was halted in Baku, the
provincial capital, and newspapers were not delivered.
   ``Strikers are demanding full political sovereignty for
Azerbaijan, which means they don't want to secede from the Soviet
Union but ought to have the right to make political decisions about
its territory,'' he said.
   An editor at the official news agency Azerinform, who would not
give his name, said 95 percent ``is a big overstatement.''
   Some factories were closed and others partially shut, he said,
while ``some shops are closed, but not ones selling food.'' He
described public transport as ``unreliable,'' but said the subway
was operating; oil refineries and power plants were functioning, and
the railroad was running.
   Tass, the official national news agency, said a strike by
transport workers in Baku was slowing travelers going to work and
shipment of finished oil products.
   About 100 people have been reported killed in a the dispute that
began 18 months ago over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountain enclave whose
population is 75 percent ethnic Armenian but was assigned to
Azerbaijan in 1923.
   Hundreds of thousands fled their homes, and the Kremlin assumed
direct rule in January.
   ``Most Azerbaijanis have left Armenian-populated areas'' in
Nagorno-Karabakh, the Azerinform editor said in a telephone
interview. ``More and more Armenians are leaving their homes in the
rest of the republic, especially Baku.''
   In Moldavia, strike committee member Pyotr Denisenko said workers
had struck 16 more factories, bringing to 218 the number shut in
protest of a new law making Moldavian the official language. Soviet
television said a national commission formed on Saturday met with
strikers for the first time.
   Labor unrest in the republic, which borders Romania, began two
weeks ago while the language law was being debated.
   On Thursday, the legislature declared Moldavian the official
language, which appeased many nationalists but angered ethnic
Russians and other groups who make up more than one-third of the 4.2
million population.
   Denisenko said in a telephone intervew the strikers want both
Russian and Moldavian to be official languages.
   The Central Committee, the 251-member policy-making body of the
national Communist Party, is to meet in Moscow later this month on
relations among the Soviet Union's more than 100 ethnic groups. The
meeting has been delayed several times and no specific date has been
set.

<HEAD>Revolutionary Historian of Ancient Rome Dead at 86</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Ronald Syme, an Oxford historian who shook the
dust from the study of ancient Rome with his theories about the
intrigues of its nobles, has died at age 86, the university said
Tuesday.
   Syme died Monday at an Oxford hospital he entered last week, said
Dr. Martin Francis, secretary of the governing body of Oxford's
Wolfson College, where Syme had lived since 1975. The hospital did
not give the cause of death.
   ``He was probably the most eminent classicist of this century,''
Francis told The Associated Press.
   ``His grasp of the language and concepts used in Roman society,
combined with his sense of style, has made him the foremost scholar
of Roman historiography,'' Kirsti Simonsuuri, senior research fellow
at the University of Helsinki, wrote in a 1983 anthology of modern
thinkers.
   Instead of focusing on the ideals and constitutional structure of
the Roman emperors as his predecessors had, Syme disclosed the lust
for power and money that motivated their careers, comparing them to
European dictators in the 1930s.
   He introduced the theories in his first and most famous book,
``The Roman Revolution,'' published Sept. 7, 1939.
   ``We were about to have a party to celebrate the 50th anniversary
of the publication next Thursday,'' said Francis, who described Syme
as an ``upright, courageous, totally dedicated man.''
   Syme was knighted in 1959. In 1976, he was awarded the Order of
Merit, Britain's most desired civil distinction, which is limited to
24 intellectuals and scientists.
   Born March 11, 1903, in New Zealand, Syme studied classics at
Oxford in the 1920s.
   He worked for the British government during World War II in
embassies in Yugoslavia and Turkey, then taught classical philology
at the University of Istanbul. Syme pioneered a method of historical
research that involved studying the backgrounds of groups of
influential people.
   As part of his work, Syme held that the Roman republic was
transformed into an empire partly because of struggles between
political factions surrounding the Emperor Augustus, who died in the
year 14.
   Although he retired in 1970 after 21 years as Oxford's Camden
Professor of Ancient History, Syme continued to work until his
death, Francis said.
   His last book, ``The Augustan Aristocracy,'' was published in
1986. Of his later works, a two-volume study of the Emperor Tacitus,
published in 1958, was generally seen as his masterpiece.
   Syme, a bachelor, was not known to have any immediate survivors.

<HEAD>Israel Finds No Backing for Plan to Rehabilitate Palestinian Camps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and other foreign nations have
rejected Israel's appeal for aid to improve conditions at
Palestinian refugee camps, calling first for progress in the Middle
East peace process, officials said Tuesday.
   In a letter this week to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, President
Bush turned down Israel's request for help to rehabilitate camps in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to Yossi
Ahimeir, Shamir's spokesman.
   He said Japan, Canada and European nations also rejected the
request.
   The Maariv newspaper reported that in his letter Bush said the
refugee camps should be part of a ``comprehensive plan to resolve
the conflict'' between Israel and Arab states.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres denounced Shamir's appeal. Israel
radio quoted him as saying the move was ``folly lacking elementary
reasoning.''
   The national news agency Itim reported that Peres, speaking at a
Histadrut Labor Federation meeting Tuesday night, said the first way
to aid the Palestinian refugees in the camps is ``for Israel to get
out of there.''
   Peres, leader of the socialist Labor Party, has accepted the
principle of trading land occupied by Israel for peace with its Arab
neighbors.
   Shamir's conservative Likud bloc, which shares power with Labor
in a coalition government, opposes any territorial concessions.
   The issue concerns more than 2 million Palestinians who were
uprooted with the founding of the state of Israel in 1948 and during
subsequent Arab-Israeli wars.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left Tuesday for
Washington, where officials said he will promote the refugee plan
and argue against PLO chief Yasser Arafat's being granted a U.S.
visa so he can address the U.N. General Assembly.
   Israeli soldiers on Tuesday shot and killed an Arab guerrilla
found several hundred yards north of the Israeli-Lebanon border
across from an Israeli communal farm, an army spokeswoman said.
   She said two other guerrillas fled after the pre-dawn clash in
the security zone Israel maintains in southern Lebanon. Israeli
forces suffered no casualties, according to the spokeswoman.
   Military sources said the guerrilla was found with an AK-47
assault rifle and grenades. Officials did not identify him or his
organization.
   The spokeswoman was not identified under military regulations.
   The army has begun using helicopters to track down wanted
Palestinians in remote West Bank villages and mountain hideouts,
Israel radio said Tuesday.
   An army spokesman said the military has used helicopters for
specific missions but refused comment on the report they would be
used in a new strategy to capture leaders in the nearly 21-month-old
Palestinian uprising.
   At least 558 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with
Israeli soldiers or civilians in the revolt against Israeli
occupation. Thirty-nine Israelis also have died.
   The latest Palestinian victim was 12-year-old Ahmed al-Abed
el-Bittar, who died Tuesday of wounds suffered in a clash last week
with soldiers, Arab reports said. He was from Khan Yunis in the Gaza
Strip.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, masked Palestinian youths
stabbed to death Naeem Fakhri Afana, 27, who was suspected of
collaborating with Israel, Arab reports said.
   At least 107 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs during
the uprising, most on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli
authorities or for drug dealing or prostitution.
   Eight Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing
clashes with Israeli troops on Tuesday, hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed the two deaths and one gunshot wound casualty.
It said it was checking other reports.
   Bush's letter came in response to Shamir's request about two
months ago for the United States to take a leading role in aiding
rehabilitation of the refugee camps, Ahimeir said.
   Bush reportedly told Shamir that the United States already plays
a prominent role in aiding the refugees by contributing to the U.N.
Relief and Works Agency, which administers the refugee camps.
   Resolving the refugee problem is a major issue in Shamir's peace
proposal, which centers on his call for elections in the occupied
territories to select Palestinians to open talks on an interim
autonomy agreement.
   Palestinian leaders demand that refugees be repatriated. Israel
rejects this and also opposes Palestinian demands that the Palestine
Liberation Organization be their prime negotiator.

<TEXT>
   Evangelist Jim Bakker, facing a hearing on
whether his fraud and conspiracy trial will continue, suffered
stress and not mental illness when he collapsed, his wife said
Tuesday.
   Also Tuesday, Bakker's lawyers filed a motion seeking a mistrial
on grounds that the collapse of a witness during defense cross
examination last week prejudiced the jury.
   The U.S. Marshal's Office said a hearing would be held at 10:30
a.m. on Wednesday to determine if Bakker is mentally competent to
stand trial. Attorneys and others in the case are forbidden to
discuss it under a gag order.
   Defense lawyer Harold Bender filed the mistrial motion just
before the court closed Tuesday.
   The motion said it was likely that jurors would blame defense
attorneys for Steve Nelson's collapse since he passed out during
cross examination by the defense.
   Nelson, a former PTL official, testified he had warned Bakker
that someone could go to prison because of financial practices at
PTL. He collapsed during that testimony, and Bakker suffered his
emotional collapse the next day.
   Tammy Faye Bakker said her husband ``was so out of it that he
thought they were taking him to an animal hospital'' when he was
sent to a prison hospital last week.
   ``After 2{ years of sheer mental torture, he was just stressed
out,'' Mrs. Bakker said in a taped statement broadcast Tuesday on
the Jim and Tammy Show.
   Bakker resigned from the PTL ministry in March 1987 in a sex and
money scandal. His trial started Aug. 28 in U.S. District Court on
charges that he used nearly $4 million in ministry funds to support
a lavish lifestyle. The trial was recessed Thursday when Bakker
didn't come to court and his psychiatrist said it was because he was
hallucinating.
   When Bakker was taken to the prison hospital at the Federal
Correctional Institution at Butner, north of Durham, Bakker
apparently confused it with an animal hospital in Charlotte named
Butler Animal Hospital.
   Mrs. Bakker also said her husband's civil rights were violated
when U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter ordered Bakker to the
federal prison hospital.
   ``Jim's constitutional rights have been violated. ... He has been
treated like a carnival show,'' she said.
   The judge ``flew into a rage'' when he was told Thursday that
Bakker couldn't come to court, Mrs. Bakker said in the broadcast,
and ``ordered federal marshals to seize him.''
   ``These big men took one small man ... and put him in shackles
... and paraded him across the yard in shackles, sobbing and crying
with his hair all messed up,'' she said.
   ``Nobody called us. No one told Jim where he was going. I called
the lawyers and they didn't even know where he was. I went for an
entire day and didn't even know if Jim was dead or alive.
   Bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy and
faces 120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines.
   Bryan Bledsoe, a spokesman at Butner, declined to comment Tuesday
on the progress of the evaluation. But he did confirm reports from
Bakker's wife that her husband was handcuffed during her visits with
him and was strip searched afterward.

   The only survivor of an airliner crash that
killed at least 150 people fought for his life in a hospital on
Tuesday with burns over 70 percent of his body, the Cuban news
agency Prensa Latina said.
   It quoted a doctor at Calixto Garcia Hospital in Havana as
reporting Luigi Capalbo, 22, of Parma, Italy, in extremely critical
condition with burns, head injuries and a broken left leg.
   Capalbo was a passenger on a Cubana de Aviacion plane that
crashed right after takeoff from Havana in a thunderstorm Sunday
night, destroying two square blocks of homes in a suburb a half-mile
from Jose Marti airport.
   Investigators searched the wreckage for clues to the cause of the
crash and Italian reports said Tuesday three of the four ``black
box'' flight recorders aboard the Soviet-made Ilyushin 62 were found.
   The airliner was carrying 113 Italians returning home from
vacation, said Prensa Latina in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City.
The flight was bound for Milan, Italy, with a stop in Cologne, West
Germany.
   By Tuesday, forensic experts had identified the bodies of 14
Italians and 26 Cubans, the agency said.
   The plane was carrying 115 passengers and 11 crew. All were
killed except Capalbo. An estimated 25 people on the ground in the
Boyeros suburb also were killed and dozens were injured.
   The Communist Party newspaper Granma quoted unidentified sources
Tuesday as saying up to 50 people on the ground may have died, the
Mexican news agency Notimex said.
   Capalbo played on an Italian baseball team and left for Cuba Aug.
21 with three teammates, all killed in the crash, Italian reports
said.
   A government commission headed by Rogelio Acevedo, president of
the Civil Aeronautics Institute, was investigating the crash, Prensa
Latina said.
   Italian government officials and a judge flew to Havana to help
in the investigation and coordinate return of the bodies, the
Italian state television network RAI said.
   It said families of the passengers flew to Rome to board a Cubana
flight to Havana.
   RAI said three of the plane's four black boxes, which record
flight data, were found.
   Prensa Latina said bodies, wrecked cars and downed trees lay
scattered where the plane crashed.
   ``It was something terrible. I've never seen anything like it, it
was a ball of fire,'' it quoted one of the injured as saying over
local TV. ``The explosion lit up the sky. We thought it was all
over.''
   One man of about 30, who lost five relatives when the plane
crashed in front of his house, walked through the blood-splattered
mud, still littered with tourism magazines, a camera, sunglasses and
a toy, Prensa Latina said.
   Jose Antonio Gonzalez, 44, a leading Cuban film critic and film
industry promoter who was one of two Cuban passengers aboard, was
buried Tuesday.
   He held several government cultural jobs, including director of
international relations of the Cuban Art and Film Industry Institute.

   An exhibit on commercial design gave Soviets a peak
at American life Tuesday, from food processors to a red Corvette,
and one wrote in the visitors' book: ``They are on the moon; we are
in a pile of manure.''
   ``That's how real people live,'' another said. ``The Americans
don't forbid people from living the good life: Why can't we have the
same things?''
   Neither of the comments was signed.
   Hundreds of Soviets crowded into the Moscow hall on the first day
of the exhibition, watched videos of American life and chatted about
life in the West with 24 Russian-speaking American guides.
   ``Design U.S.A.'' was divided into four parts: architecture,
products, graphic design and design in motion.
   The displays drawing the most visitors were motorcycles,
bicycles, sports equipment, the Corvette and a kitchen even more
modern than the one in which Richard M. Nixon debated Nikita S.
Khrushchev at the first U.S. exhibition 30 years ago.
   After gazing at the kitchen display, housewife Tanya Russkina
said: ``We don't have anything like this. It's so modern and
comfortable.''
   She said the exhibition proved relations between the United
States and Soviet Union were improving.
   A 12-year-old looked beyond a Harley-Davidson motorcycle to the
racing bicycles on display. ``The bike is what I really would like
to have,'' he said. ``The kayak would be nice to have also.''
   The exhibition is the 19th showcase of American life to come to
the Soviet Union. It opened on the 30th anniversary of the U.S.
display, where Nixon, then vice prresident, and Soviet leader
Khrushchev held the impromptu ``kitchen debate'' on the relative
merits of capitalism and communism.
   Sarah Despres, a guide, said her Russian was a little rusty.
   ``It's a little nerve-wracking,'' she said, but added that the
visitors were very patient. ``When someone speaks too fast, the
others tell him to slow down,'' she said.
   The only complaint heard during a tour of the display came from a
woman who was could not push through the crowd to the kitchen.
``There are too many people and not enough exhibits,'' she said.
   After the exhibition closes in Moscow on Oct. 1, it will move on
to Leningrad, Donetsk, Kishinev, Baku, Khabarovsk and Vladivostok.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's new $7.8 billion drug plan is a
courageous combination of law enforcement and treatment, the head of
the nation's largest private, non-profit drug treatment center said
Tuesday.
   The founder and president of Phoenix House, Dr. Mitchell S.
Rosenthal, who has seen a draft copy of President Bush's plan, said
the program could have an even higher success rate than the
president is projecting.
   ``I think the goals of a 50 percent reduction are probably too
modest,'' Rosenthal said before leaving for a White House meeting
with Bush and federal drug czar William Bennett.
   ``I think if the American public can get behind this plan, we can
see a 75 to 80 percent reduction in drug use over the next 10
years.''
   Rosenthal, who brought Bennett to a Phoenix House facility in the
borough of Queens three months ago, said the best aspect of the Bush
proposal was its acknowledgement of jail as the start of a road to
rehabilitation. Funds for the program will be divided 70 percent for
law enforcement, 30 percent for treatment, the doctor said.
   ``I'm very encouraged with the plan. It's a gutsy, comprehensive
plan which addresses a coming together of treatment and law
enforcement concerns,'' Rosenthal said at a news conference.
   ``It recognizes most users are not motivated for treatment, and
includes sanctions to push them toward treatment. ... Jails are an
opportunity to begin treatment.''
   Rosenthal said one key to Bush's plan is convincing Americans
that casual drug use is an evil that must be stopped. In 1962, 2
percent of Americans said they had used illicit drugs; in 1982, it
was 38 percent, he said.
   ``It's essential to target casual users. This plan is trying to
make casual use by mainstream Americans something to think long and
hard about,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Files Complaint Over False-Positive AIDS Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who planned her funeral, was evicted
from her trailer and lost her boyfriend after two tests mistakenly
showed she had the AIDS virus has filed a complaint against the
hospital and doctors involved.
   ``It should never have happened and I don't think it ever ought
to happen again,'' Gayla Gray said in a recent interview with The
Indianapolis News. ``I wouldn't wish this on someone I despised.''
   Gray, 33, of Noblesville, was hospitalized for peritonitis in
1987 and was tested for AIDS antibodies when she failed to respond
to antibiotic treatment. The first test was positive, as was a
second, more sophisticated test on the same blood sample.
   Thirteen months later, doctors discovered those tests were wrong
when a routine test on Gray's blood came up negative for the HIV
antibody. They re-tested the original blood sample that had been
stored at Indiana University Hospital and it tested negative.
   In the meantime, Gray's boyfriend broke up with her, friends and
neighbors shunned her and her teen-age daughter was taunted by
schoolmates. Gray, a nurse, had not been working during the period
because of other health problems.
   Her complaint, which seeks an unspecified amount of damages, was
pending before the medical malpractice division of the Indiana State
Insurance Commission. If the case is not settled by the panel, it
will proceed to court.
   Neither party has yet requested a medical review panel be
appointed to hear the case, Marsha Harrison, chief counsel for the
medical malpractice division, said Tuesday.
   Dr. Robert Goulet and another physician named in Gray's
complaint, Dr. Richard Kohler, said an attorney had told them not to
discuss the case. A third physician named in the complaint, Dr.
Lawrence Wheat, did not return telephone calls placed to his office
Tuesday.
   Gray's lawyer, Michael W. Van Treese, believes the mistake could
have occurred in one of two ways.
   The tests for the AIDS virus could have registered false
positives. In that case, Treese said, doctors should have retested
Gray's blood earlier than they did, since the number of T-cells
present was much higher than usual for HIV-positive tests.
   A second possibility is that Gray's blood sample could have been
confused with another patient's. ``This other person could have been
told they do not have the virus, and they have now spread that
further in the community,'' he said.
   Before Gray even left the hospital after recovering from
peritonitis, she learned she had been evicted from her trailer. Her
landlord said it was because the grass hadn't been cared for.
   Later, several people told her the landlord had burned the
trailer because no one wanted to live where an AIDS patient had
lived.
   Gray said her father, her two sisters and other family members
rallied around her, but her boyfriend couldn't accept her having the
AIDS virus.
   ``I had told him that if he decided to break up, I certainly
would understand,'' Gray said.
   Her 16-year-old daughter, Becky, also pulled away and friends
shunned her. The family began receiving prank phone calls. Someone
scrawled ``AIDS'' in the snow on Gray's car.
   ``Living in a small town, you know, you tell one person and the
whole world knows,'' Gray said.
   She lived in fear from day to day, expecting every minor ailment
to develop into AIDS, she said. ``I was so sure I was going to die
that I already had picked out the thing I was going to wear to my
funeral.''
   Gray said she felt euphoric in October 1988 when she heard she
was all right. But then she grew angry.
   ``I still don't understand how something like that could have
happened,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Jamaican singer and actress Grace Jones
failed to show up Tuesday for her trial on cocaine possession
charges, and a court said it will order her arrest if she doesn't
appear at the rescheduled trial.
   Ms. Jones' attorney, Tom Tavares-Simson, told St. Andrew Criminal
Court Magistrate Owen Parkin that her ``absence was due to
contractual bligations in Italy which she was unable to break, and
should not be taken as any form of disrespect for the court.''
   Parkin issued an arrest warrant but immediately suspended it,
making it effective Oct. 3 if she fails to show up for a new trial
on that date.
   The trial had already been postponed three times since it was
originally scheduled in June, either because prosecutors were not
familiar with the case, witnesses were missing or judges failed to
show up.
   Ms. Jones, 37, returned to the Caribbean island for the last
three trial dates after flying from Paris, Italy and Spain. Each
time she complained of the high cost of flying back to Jamaica, only
to learn in court that the trial had been suspended.
   Ms. Jones was arrested in April while vacationing in Kingston and
charged with possession of .006 ounces of cocaine that police found
in her handbag. Police said the street value of the cocaine was less
than $18.
   She was freed on $2,500 bail.

<TEXT>
   Elie Wiesel, an Auschwitz survivor and Nobel Peace
laureate, said Tuesday only Pope John Paul II can end the conflict
over whether to move a Roman Catholic convent away from the
Auschwitz death camp in Poland.
   The American writer asked the pope to take a clear position on
the issue.
   Both Wiesel, a Jew, and the pope were born in Poland.
   John Paul has made no public comment on the controversy over the
Carmelite convent, which was to be moved to an interfaith prayer
center under an agreement between Jewish and Catholic leaders signed
in Geneva in 1987.
   A deadline for the transfer passed last Feb. 22, leading to
protests at the site by Jewish activists. Polish church leaders then
said the agreement was suspended because of the protests and what
they called ``aggressive'' demands. Cardinal Josef Glemp, the
primate of Poland, was quoted last week as calling for the agreement
to be renegotiated.
   Vatican officials have said, on condition of anonymity, that the
pope believes the problem should be worked out by the Poles without
his intervention.
   ``The pope's silence will be judged by history,'' Wiesel said
during a visit to Paris. ``How could the pope who, in his crusades
around the world, speaks of the problems of the countries he passes
through, sometimes with courage, fail to take a position on an
affair concerning his own country?''
   Wiesel has campaigned tirelessly for human rights and has
stressed the need to remember the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust.
   Cardinal Albert Decourtray, the primate of France who headed the
Roman Catholic delegation at the 1987 negotiations, has called for
the agreement to be carried out, but said on Sunday he hoped it
could be done without involving the pope.

<HEAD>Government Says Austerity Measures Will Help Obtain Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government said Tuesday if
recently decreed austerity measures succeed they will help this
impoverished Caribbean nation receive up to $340 million in aid.
   Finance Minister Leonce Thelusma told a press conference that
once Haiti has ``cleaned up its house'' it will receive the funds
from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
   He said when ``we have put our public finances in order, we will
obtain an Enlarged Structural Adjustment Loan of about $50 million''
from the IMF.
   An additional $170 million would come from the World Bank and
$100 million from the Inter-American Development Bank, according to
Thelusma.
   That amounts to $320 million and the finance minister did not say
where the additional $20 million would come from, nor did he say
when Haiti expected to receive the aid.
   Haiti's annual budget is under $300 million.
   In a series of weekend decrees, the government of Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril raised tariffs on imports, changed tax deductions for
home loans, increased the number of merchants required to pay the 10
percent value-added tax on their sales by including smaller
businesses and raised taxes on basic foodstuffs.
   The moves are designed to help the government balance its budget
and are ``a pill we have to take now, but in the long run the
results will be positive,'' Thelusma said.
   The Chamber of Commerce and many businessmen and politicians
criticized the austerity measures, saying they would hurt the poor
and provoke social unrest.
   Thelusma confirmed unofficial reports that Haiti is negotiating
with the IMF. He said the economic measures were not demanded by the
IMF and were initiated by the government.
   Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican
Republic, is one of the world's poorest nations. It has a foreign
debt of $800 million and the annual per capita income is less than
$300.
   Declining farm production has been aggravated by cheap products
smuggled into the country, mainly from Florida, and political
instability has dissuaded foreign and local businessmen from
investing.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday proposed cuts in
juvenile justice, housing, immigration and economic development
programs to help defray some of the costs of his new anti-drug
program.
   But the size of the cuts, less than $800 million, was relatively
small compared with the overall $7.9 billion price tag of the
program Bush outlined in his first nationally televised addres to
the nation.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman said that most of the
funds for the president's new program already had been earmarked or
proposed previously by the president.
   Overall, the package represents a $2.2 billion spending increase
over the current anti-drug effort.
   But of that, just $716 million would represent a budgetary
increase over funds Bush already requested of Congress in his
February budget message and his May anti-crime package.
   Ending weeks of silence on how Bush would pay for the package,
Darman was ready with a series of reductions that he said would
cover the increases.
   ``This isn't a come-later approach,'' Darman told a briefing.
   However the $751 million list of program reductions _ a juvenile
justice program, funds for housing, immigration and rural economic
development, a postal program and a Pentagon communications project
_ drew immediate skepticism from Capitol Hill.
   ``To say we've declared war and developed a domestic policy and a
foreign policy and then we have to go back and nickel-and-dime from
the different committees to raise $700 million, to me it just
doesn't seem as though we're sincere,'' said Rep. Charles Rangle,
D-N.Y., chairman of the select House Committee on Narcotics Abuse
and Control.
   In addition, House Democrats suggested that Bush still has not
said how he would pay for all of his earlier anti-crime proposals.
   The White House announced the overall program in terms of budget
authority _ which includes some spending on projects in future years
and thus tends to exaggerate the price tag, some critics contend.
   In terms of budget outlays, money that will be actually shelled
out in the fiscal yera beginning Oct. 1, the program's first-year
price tag comes to $6.4 billion, rather than the $7.9 billion in
budget authority.
   One reason for the disparity in the two figures is that a
fair-sized chunk of the program involves spending on new prisons,
and most of those costs would not be paid until later years, budget
officials said.
   Darman gave his list of the $716 million in ``new spending''
proposals, along with his $751 million in offsetting costs, in a
letter to the chairmen and senior Republicans on the House and
Senate approprations committees.
   The proposed cuts:
   _$320 million from a Human and Health Services program to help
states bear the costs of immigration legalization services. The
White House cited a slow start-up for the program as rationale, and
said states will still have sufficient funds available.
   _$194 million from the Economic Development Administration of the
Commerce Department, a program that former President Reagan long
sought to kill.
   _$40 million from a grant program for the Justice Department's
juvenile justice program. Budget officials claimed claimed the
orignial purpose of the program _ separation of junveile from adult
offenders _ had already been accomplished.
   _$15 million from a fund set up to reclaim lost postal revenue
through curbing past abuses of federal subsidies to non-profit
mailers.
   _$50 million from public housing operating subsidies by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, funds that essentially
would be redirected to a HUD program to rid public housing of drug
dealers and to increase security.
   _$132 million from the Defense Department's Single Channel Ground
and Airborne Radio System, which the White House said needs more
testing.

   A prominent politician and union leader
shot to death in his office Tuesday was among at least 25 people
reported killed in Sri Lanka's ethnic violence, officials reported.
   Military officials said an unidentified man walked into the
office of Merril Wijeyesena Kariyawasam in Ratmalana, a town 10
miles south of Colombo, and opened fire.
   Kariyawasam, 52, was a senior official of the National Workers
Union, affiliated with the governing United National Party. He
formerly represented the southern Agalawatte constituency in
Parliament and was chairman of the state-owned Rubber Research
Institute.
   A bodyguard was wounded in the attack, during which four
accomplices of the gunman stood watch outside, said the officials,
who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   They said the raiders were believed to be from the People's
Liberation Front, a group of Sinhalese extremists trying to
overthrow the government.
   Earlier Tuesday, President Ranasinghe Premadasa told the
governing party's Parliament delegation the crisis had ``shaken the
very foundations of democracy and human rights.'' He urged all
parties to work for an end to ethnic violence.
   The government says more than 5,000 people have been killed in
two years of violence by the Sinhalese radicals.
   Premadasa plans an all-party meeting Sept. 13 to seek solutions
to ethnic problems. He invited the People's Liberation Front, which
has rejected other peace offers, but it has not responded.
   ``What is essential is the bringing in of all groups that still
remain outside the democratic process within its fold,'' he told the
United National Party lawmakers.
   Officials have reported at least 20 deaths a day in the past
week, the bloodiest of the Sinhalese extremist campaign. At least
237 people were killed in the Aug. 28-Sept. 4 period, according to
military reports.
   A senior military official said Tuesday the radical Sinhalese had
built an army of about 7,500 men with sophisticated weapons,
supported by 2,000 people who can use ``a shotgun, or maybe a
single-shot rifle.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier estimates by defense officials have said the extremists
had a fighting force of about 2,500.
   Sri Lanka's security force number 103,000 _ a 42,000-member
police force, 50,000 soldiers, 7,000 men in the navy and an air
force of 4,000.
   Sinhalese radicals protest autonomy concessions made in a July
1987 peace agreement to Tamils militants, who seek an independent
nation in the north and east. They also demand withdrawal of Indian
peacekeeping troops deployed in the Tamil area.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and claim discrimination by the
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
   The 6-year-old Tamil war has killed 11,000 people, including
1,000 Indian soldiers.
   India became involved because it is the regional power and its
own population includes 60 million Tamils, most of whom live in
southern India, just across the Palk Strait from Sri Lanka.

   A Brazilian jetliner that vanished
two days ago crash-landed in the Amazon jungle, and 46 of the 54
people aboard survived, an air force spokesman said Tuesday.
   Authorities found the plane Tuesday afternoon about 1,300 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro after four survivors walked about two
hours through the rain forest to a ranch in Alto Xingu region of the
eastern Amazon, Col. Ronaldo Borges of the Air Force Ministry said.
   From the ranch, the survivors contacted the ministry by ham
radio, and a C-130 transport plane dropped emergency kits with food,
water and medicine by parachute over the downed plane, where the
remaining 42 survivors are camped out, the air force spokesman said.
   An air force helicopter with a medical crew arrived at the crash
area about 6 p.m., but darkness forced authorities to cut short
rescue efforts and tending to the injured until dawn Wednesday,
Borges said.
   ``The rescue team will attend to the injured and stay with the
survivors through the night,'' the spokesman said.
   The survivors included the pilot and five other crew members, who
Borges pronounced ``in good condition.''
   A twin-engine Bandeirante plane and two helicopters had arrived
at Sao Jose do Xingu, about 35 miles away, and would begin ferrying
victims from the crash site to the town at first light, he said.
   Borges said the Boeing 737-200, which was en route from Maraba to
Belem at the mouth of the Amazon River, crash-landed Sunday near Sao
Jose do Xingu but cause of the accident remained unclear.
   Joao Luis de Sousa, a spokesman for Varig, said visibility was
poor because of brush fires and thick fog, making landing difficult.
   The plane disappeared on the last leg of a regularly scheduled
flight between the southeastern city of Sao Paulo and Belem, 2,140
miles northwest of Rio. The plane had made scheduled stops in
Uberaba, Uberlandia, Goiania, Brasilia, Imperatriz and Maraba.
   According to Borges, the pilot reported problems in his
navigational system and strayed far off route. Two hours after his
scheduled arrival in Belem, the pilot radioed the airport at
Carajas, 600 miles from Belem, asking for permission to make an
emergency landing.
   Ten minutes later, a Cruzeiro airline plane received the pilot's
final message, saying he was running out of fuel, had only one
engine working and would try to make an emergency landing in the
jungle, Borges said.
   Helio Smidt, the president of Varig, who was directing the
company's rescue operations in Belem, confirmed radio contact from
the survivor.
   Varig officials said all 48 passengers and six crew were
Brazilian.

   For the third week in a row, the babysitting
comedy ``Uncle Buck'' was No. 1 at the nation's theaters while the
Vietnam drama ``Casualties of War'' dropped off the charts
completely.
   According to Labor Day weekend figures released Tuesday by
Exhibitor Relations Co., ``Uncle Buck,'' starring John Candy as an
obnoxious relative taking care of his two nieces and a nephew,
grossed $7.8 million.
   In second place was director Ron Howard's ``Parenthood,'' a
comedy featuring Steve Martin, Jason Robards, Mary Steenburgen and
Rick Moranis. ``Parenthood'' collected $7.5 million. It was followed
in third by the underwater action film ``The Abyss,'' with receipts
of $5.5 million.
   ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' the action sequel reuniting Mel Gibson and
Danny Glover, was fourth with ticket sales of $4.7 million. In fifth
was the romantic comedy ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' with Billy
Crystal and Meg Ryan, which had revenues of $4 million.
   In sixth was the drooling police comedy ``Turner &amp; Hooch,''
pairing Tom Hanks with a salivating canine, which grossed $3.8
million. ``Batman'' finished in seventh with a gate of $3.5 million.
   ``sex, lies and videotape,'' the acclaimed character study that
has been playing in limited release, expanded to 347 screens over
the weekend and boosted its income to $3.4 million for eighth place.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Relentless,'' the new Judd Nelson
movie in ninth on 42.8 million, and ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' in
10th with $2.7 million.
   ``Casualties of War,'' the story of a group of U.S. soldiers who
rape and murder a South Vietnamese girl during the war, has proved
to be a flop. In just its third week of release, ``Casualties of
War,'' starring Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn, took in $1.9 million.
It has grossed only $13.7 million so far and is no longer on the
leader board.
   In limited release, ``Shirley Valentine'' made its debut to
strong business, collecting $245,422 on eight screens.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater

   The following outlines components of President
Bush's national drug strategy at a glance. The highlights of the
strategy include:
   _ $350 million for states and local governments for criminal
justice, law enforcement and prison systems.
   _ $1.2 billion for construction of federal prisons.
   _ Requiring federally acceptable drug prevention programs and
policies as a condition to receive federal funds for schools and
colleges.
   _ Withholding federal criminal justice funds from states that do
not have drug testing for prisoners, parolees and people arrested,
and consider test results when determining sentencing, bail and
parole.
   _ $261 million to help the Andean countries of Peru, Bolivia and
Colombia fight drug lords.
   _ More money for domestic eradication efforts.
   _ Tougher regulations for federal housing projects to expedite
evictions of drug dealers, and expand drug prevention programs for
resident associations.
   _ Urges greater use of employee drug testing in state and local
government and the private sector.
   _ Encourages stiffer penalties for drug users.
   _ More federal money for community drug prevention efforts.
   _ Increased money for treatment programs to expand the number of
people who can be treated, the range of treatment programs, and
emphasize treatment for pregnant women who use drugs.
   _ Making receipt of federal treatment funds contingent on state
and local compliance with federal standards for effective drug
treatment programs.
   _ Expanded research and information coordination to evaluate and
develop more effective treatments.
   _ Greater border interdiction emphasis on drug-detection dogs,
document fraud, container inspection and other methods.
   _ More emphasis on air interdiction, and catching drug couriers
and money launderers.

   The U.S. Justice Department said
Tuesday it may investigate whether authorities used excessive force
to quell Labor Day weekend riots, but officials defended the actions
of police and National Guard troops.
   ``This is the most devastating thing to ever happen to our resort
city,'' Mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf said at a news conference. ``We
are eternally thankful that no lives were lost in this tragedy.''
   Merchants in this seaside resort spent the day cleaning up from
the rioting early Sunday and Sunday night, much of it by black
college students attending the annual end-of-summer Greekfest.
   At least 100 businesses were looted, more than 1,000 people were
arrested and 30 police officers or National Guard soldiers were
injured, authorities said.
   Police toting 30-inch-long riot batons and National Guard troops
armed with unloaded M-16 rifles or .45-caliber pistols and billy
clubs cleared city streets of rioters. The 325 Virginia National
Guardsmen were dispatched at the city's request.
   State civil rights leaders have said police overreacted, that the
city and merchants made the students feel unwelcome and that police
would have reacted differently had the crowd been white.
   Deborah Burstion-Wade, a Justice Department spokesman in
Washington, said it was possible the FBI and the department's Civil
Rights Division would investigate the riot's handling after
reviewing videotapes. She said the department had received no
complaints of excessive police force.
   Oberndorf, who has called the last accusation ``poppycock,'' said
officials have received hundreds of calls supporting police.
   ``These officers were exposed to an extreme situation,'' said
City Manager Aubrey V. Watts Jr. ``It's incredible that they were
able to restore law and order without firing a single shot or using
fatal force.''
   Maj. Gen. John G. Castles, commander of the Virginia National
Guard, said he was pleased with his troops' actions. He said they
performed their duties in a professional manner under difficult
circumstances.
   According to preliminary police reports, 1,235 people were
charged with 1,346 offenses between Friday and Monday, mostly
disorderly conduct, drinking violations and traffic offenses.
   ``These statistics do not even begin to tell the story,'' said
Police Chief Charles R. Wall. ``When you're in the middle of a riot,
you don't have time to make arrests. Your main concern is to get the
streets secured.''
   An estimated 100,000 people jammed Atlantic Avenue, Virginia
Beach's main drag, before the violence began.
   Merchants plan to meet this week to discuss how to prevent
another riot next Labor Day weekend, said Rick Kowalewitch, owner of
RK's Windsurf Shop.
   ``You can't do a whole lot,'' said Kowalewitch, who had an
employee armed with a shotgun guard his store. ``No matter what we
do, we look like a racist.''
   Many of the young people who were chased off the streets by
police were black, but Kowalewitch said he and other whites were
ordered off the streets as well.
   He said police properly enforced city crowd control ordinances
enacted after last year's Greekfest became unruly.
   Greekfest participants who remained at the beach Tuesday were
divided on whether they would return next year.
   Brad Williams, 23, of White Plains, N.Y., said he has been coming
to Greekfest for five years and will come back. ``I enjoy myself,''
he said.
   But Tracy Duncan, 26, of Springfield, Mass., said her first
Greekfest will be her last.
   ``This was really outrageous,'' she said of the police crackdown.
``It's like being in a prison camp.''

   Seven children who had been playing in
the street and one woman were killed Tuesday when a rocket slammed
into the dirt road of a poor neighborhood in north Kabul, residents
said.
   They said at least five people were wounded by shrapnel from the
explosion. At least six rockets hit the Khair Khana area around 4
p.m., they added.
   The children ranged in age from 5 to 12 years, the residents said.
   Kabul has come under rocket attack almost daily since late June.
More than 300 people have been killed and more than 700 injured. A
heavy attack Saturday killed 16 people and wounded 52.
   The government blames the U.S-backed mujahedeen rebels based in
Pakistan for the attacks. The mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors,
accuse the Marxist government itself of firing the rockets.
   In Khair Khana, the spent rockets looked like crumpled tin cans
in the dust.
   The wailing of women came from over the mud brick garden walls as
neighbors scurried back and forth trying to comfort the bereaved.
   ``This is an American-Pakistani rocket,'' said a resident named
Aiamodin as he kicked with his toe a shell case embedded in the road.
   Nearby, on a street where the rocket shattered walls but did not
kill anyone, residents worked to clean up the mess.
   A young girl dumped a basketful of glass in a ditch while a
workman replaced the windows in the corner pharmacy.
   ``It's just a poor neighborhood, shopkeepers,'' said Mohammed, a
government employee.

   A Texas-based insurance company has hired
former House Speaker Jim Wright to give pep talks to its salesmen
and make public appearances, the company said in a statement Tuesday.
   The Texas Democrat will not lobby Congress or make other ``formal
contacts with government'' in his new post as special consultant to

   The statement did not say how much Wright would be paid for his
services.
   The company statement praised Wright as a ``prolific writer'' and
listed three of his books.
   Absent, however, was ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' the book
whose unusual bulk sales and royalty arrangements led to an ethics
investigation and eventually to Wright's resignation from Congress
in June.
   A federal grand jury is investigating the sales of that book.

<HEAD>Drug Plan Strikes at Casual Users As Well As Drug Traffickers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New details throughout</HEAD>

   The $7.9 billion national drug control strategy
announced Tuesday by the Bush administration recommends stripping
even casual drug users of their drivers licenses while mounting a
costly struggle against the drug lords of South America.
   ``Whatever the extent of their offense, if they use drugs they
should be held accountable,'' President Bush declared of the
millions of casual drug users in this country.
   For the most hardened drug traffickers in the United States, Bush
renewed his endorsement of the death penalty.
   For the war against the drug lords of South America, he
recommended $261 million in 1990 aid and the promise of $2 billion
more over the following five years for the governments of Colombia,
Peru and Bolivia _ nations that produce most of the cocaine that
crosses U.S. borders.
   For the casual drug users in the United States, he urged states
to suspend their drivers licenses, notify their employers, put them
in jail cells overnight or on weekends, evict them from public
housing or seize their cars. He also urged newspapers to publish the
names of drug offenders.
   The president called for ``a mix of sanctions'' against the
youthful offender, including school suspension, parental
notification, postponement of drivers license eligibility and
weekends of community service.
   The plan envisions military-style boot camps ``to bring a sense
of order and discipline to the lives of youthful, non-violent
first-time offenders and perhaps serve as a deterrent against future
crimes.''
   Among its other proposals: halfway houses and ``various house
arrest programs that keep an offender incapacitated at his own
expense.''
   The proposals include an increase in federal funds for treatment
of addicts and for prevention programs.
   But the main emphasis was on bringing the suppliers and users of
illegal drugs to justice.
   ``We should be tough on drugs _ much tougher than we are now,''
the president's 154-page report declared.
   ``Anyone who sells drugs _ and (to a great if poorly understood
extent) anyone who uses them _ is involved in an international
criminal enterprise that is killing thousands of Americans each
year,'' says the strategy which Bush unveiled in a nationally
televised address.
   National drug control policy director William J. Bennett summed
up a crucial element of the $7.9 billion anti-drug strategy: ``Drug
use, we say, is wrong.''
   ``There are lots of other things that are wrong _ money
laundering, crime, violence in the inner city _ but drug use itself
is wrong, and that means the strategy is aimed at reducing drug
use,'' Bennett said at a White House briefing shortly before Bush's
speech.
   The White House recommendations to the states are just that _
Bush rejected earlier plans to threaten states with the loss of
federal highway funds and criminal justice funds if they failed to
implement tough new sanctions.
   However, states must impose drug testing for arrestees,
prisoners, parolees and those out on bail to receive criminal
justice grants.
   Similar testing would be mandated for all federal arrestees, and
complete abstinence from drugs would be a condition for release on
bond, probation or parole.
   Bush plans to help cities enforce whatever anti-drug laws they
have on the books by pumping $350 million into law enforcement
grants, a $200 million increase over the current authorization.
Local governments can use some of the money to plan new jails, while
the federal government sets aside some $1.2 billion for construction
of new federal prisons.
   The federal prison system has a capacity of 31,000 inmates. The
strategy recommends expanding this by 77 percent.
   While the Bush strategy focuses on making those at all levels of
drug trafficking pay for their crimes, it also would provide help
for addicts, particularly those suffering from addiction to crack,
the relatively cheap cocaine derivative that is smoked.
   The Bush proposal calls for a 53 percent increase in federal
funds for drug abuse treatment, from $604 million authorized in the
current budget to $925 million in 1990. Programs would have to
demonstrate their success to receive funds.
   In addition, the strategy seeks $1.2 billion for prevention
efforts, 25 percent over the current authorization of $943 million.
   The strategy calls for $25 million in emergency drug education
grants for urban areas with major drug problems. That would be in
addition to the $350 million now spent to support school-based drug
education programs.
   It also requires schools, colleges and universities to impose
firm drive prevention programs and policies to receive any federal
funds.
   Overseas, the strategy takes into account the plight of the
governments of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, the three main cocaine
producers, in their efforts to combat the drug trade while battling
insurgent groups and maintaining a legitimate economy.
   The recent flareup of violence in Colombia _ where the government
reinstituted its agreement to extradite alleged drug traffickers to
the United States to stand trial _ already has resulted in the
emergency dispatch of some $65 million in immediate military aid.
   For 1990, the strategy calls for $261 million to be spent in
military and law enforcement aid for these three South American
countries, more than a four-fold increase over the approximately $53
million in the current budget for anti-drug efforts. Total foreign
aid to those countries, including the anti-drug money, is almost
$163 million in 1989.
   Budget Director Richard Darman announced Tuesday that the
administration will seek $2 billion over the next five years in
economic aid to the three countries, much of it contingent on those
countries proving their willingness to fight drug traffickers.
   The strategy urges ``elevation of drugs as a bilateral foreign
policy issue'' and says that ``In the past, programs in this area
have been hampered by the lack of importance given by this country
to the drug issue as a foreign policy concern.''
   Meanwhile, the strategy also called for more widespread drug
testing in the public and private sectors, and encouraged employers
to identify employees who use drugs, including drug testing ``where
appropriate.''
   The numbers in the strategy reflect authorization figures, not
what actually will be spent or where that money will come from. For
example, one Senate staffer familiar with the drug issue noted that
prisons take a long time to build, and only a small portion of the
$1.2 billion for prisons will be spent in 1990.
   When Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, it called
for authorization of $2.8 billion above what was already being
spent. Faced with a staggering budget deficit, Congress agreed to
spend only $500 million in fiscal 1989 and up to $967 million by the
end of fiscal 1990.
   A bid by the House to spend $822 million in a supplementary
spending bill earlier this year was killed following a threat by
Darman. The supplementary spending on anti-drug efforts later was
lowered to about $75 million.

<HEAD>Chris Evert's Last Major Tournament Appearance Ends in Defeat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The illustrious pro tennis career of Chris Evert
came to an end Tuesday in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open when
she was beaten by Zina Garrison, 7-6, 6-2.
   Evert's final shot at a major event was a forehand return of
serve into the net. She shook hands with Garrison and received a
standing ovation from the crowd.
   The 34-year-old Evert will represent the United States in the
Federation Cup at Tokyo next month, and might play in some other
tournaments, but she said this was her last appearance in a major
tournament.
   The classy master of the two-handed backhand, with peerless
baseline groundstrokes and a nearly stoic on-court demeanor, first
made her mark by reaching the semifinals at the U.S. Open in 1971,
when she was 16.
   ``I've had a lot of success here,'' Evert said. ``I've got
excellent memories of Forest Hills and Flushing Meadow. The crowds
were great all week and that's very special to me.''
   Earlier in the tournament, Evert became the first player with 100
victories in the Open.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Says Moscow Seeks `Truly Federal State'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a visiting Soviet delegation said
Tuesday that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to develop a
``truly federal state,'' but ruled out independence for Soviet
republics seeking greater autonomy.
   Breakaway independent states ``would not be in the interests of
either the Baltic republics themselves or the U.S.S.R,'' said
Yevgeny M. Primakov, chairman of the Soviet of the Union, one of two
houses of the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   ``What we are trying to achieve is a truly federal state and not
in name only, but in essence,'' he said, speaking through an
interpreter at the news conference at the Soviet Embassy. ``We would
like the republics to be as sovereign and independent as possible.''
   Primakov is in London for a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union, a gathering of lawmakers from around the world.
   Earlier, Moscow and London announced that British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher will visit Moscow for talks with Gorbachev on
Sept. 23 on her way home from a trip to Tokyo.
   It will be their first meeting since Britain expelled 11 Soviet
diplomats and journalists in May, charging they were spies, and the
Soviet Union retaliated by ordering out 11 Britons.
   Primakov said he hoped the visit would give a new impetus to arms
control negotiations and other East-West issues.
   ``We are not going to forget that the first meeting between
Mikhail Gorbachev and Margaret Thatcher was in a way a prelude to a
number of developments in the international arena which considerably
reduced tensions,'' said Primakov.
   He was referring to a 1984 meeting in London. Gorbachev and Mrs.
Thatcher appeared to strike up a particularly good personal
relationship and she described him as someone with whom she could
``do business.''
   However, relations cooled after the expulsions in May.
   Also Tuesday, the Foreign Office announced that Foreign Secretary
John Major will visit the United States next week.
   Major, who became foreign secretary in July, will spend Sunday
through Tuesday in Washington and meet with President Bush, Vice
President Dan Quayle and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.

   A prisoner who won $1,000 in a restaurant
promotion was escorted to the post office in handcuffs Tuesday to
mail paperwork to receive his prize.
   Police spokesman Kerry Pool said one person complained that
inmate Charles E. Wilson was not entitled to the money, ``since the
taxpayers bought the meal that enabled him to win.''
   But most people were happy for Wilson, who is being held for
extradition to face a drug charge in Missouri, Pool said.
   Mayor David Kinley agreed: ``I thought it was great _ usually
it's some rich dude that wins the money in a contest like that, not
someone in need, like this fellow.''
   Wilson, 33, who was arrested last week while hitchhiking, had
finished munching on a jail-provided McDonald's fish sandwich and
french fries Sunday night when he decided to peel a game piece from
his medium Coca-Cola.
   ``I thought maybe I'd win a hamburger and they'd pick me up an
extra one,'' Wilson said.
   However, ``I pulled it off and said, `Do what?' It's pretty good
to be sitting in jail and win $1,000,'' Wilson said Monday.
   A McDonald's spokesman said Wilson's chance of winning was
476,000-to-1.
   Officers fetched paperwork for Wilson to redeem the prize, Pool
said. But the prisoner had to sign in person to send the game piece
to McDonald's by registered mail, so he was escorted to the postal
counter a block from the jail, Pool said.
   ``The check is going to be mailed to his mother in Illinois,
since Mr. Wilson doesn't know what his home address is going to be
for awhile,'' Pool said.
   Wilson paid his own postage, Pool said.
   After signing the forms, Wilson was taken to the Faulkner County
Jail, since the city jail is a short-term holding facility, Pool
said. He will probably have a hearing Thursday, he said.
   Unlike the city jail, which sends out to McDonald's for all
prisoner meals, the county jail does its own cooking.
   When a reporter noted that the authorities were being helpful to
the prisoner, Pool said: ``He is incarcerated, but we want to treat
him as humanely as we would want to be treated under these
circumstances. This is the first time we ever had a prisoner win a
prize like this.''

<HEAD>Gadhafi Calls U.S. Dollar `Devil Itself,' Seeks Resettling of Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi told
the non-aligned movement Tuesday in a rambling speech that the U.S.
dollar is ``the devil itself'' and Jews in Israel should be
resettled elsewhere.
   Gadhafi spoke without a prepared text for one hour and 25 minutes
on the second day of the four-day summit, ignoring the time limit of
20 minutes for each leader addressing the assembly.
   Some delegates said the speech was an embarrassment.
   Earlier, Cuban Vice President Raul Castro fired broadsides
against the United States, accusing it of nurturing subversion plans
against Cuba.
   In other speeches to the delegates from 102 nations:
   _Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said, ``It is dominance by
economic pressure that is now emerging as the single most important
threat to the independence, freedom and stability of the non-aligned
nations. ... The central issue in the present international economic
order is the domination of the global economy by a few without
regard to the interests of the many.''
   _Nigerian President Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida demanded major
concessions from the West to ease the debt burden, as did other
African delegates earlier. He said official debts owed to creditor
countries should be abolished through ``outright cancellation by
creditor countries.'' He asked partial writeoffs of debts to
commercial banks and international financial institutions.
   _The Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah proposed an
international meeting under U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar involving creditor countries, the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank on ways to resolve the debt crisis.
   Gadhafi's address, simultaneously translated on in-house
television at the Sava Hall conference center, was marked by
incomplete sentences and repetitive and often confusing statements.
   ``The dollar is one of the worst currencies, the devil itself, it
should be burned, it should not be of any real value at all,'' the
Libyan leader declared.
   He also said charging interest on credits was ``against the
religion of Islam'' and that Libya would stop demanding interest
from debtor countries.
   He said ``the Jews'' should be resettled ``from Palestine'' to
form a buffer state between France and Germany.
   Later he suggested that ``if the United States is sympathizing
with (the Jews) why doesn't it give them Alaska?''
   In an apparent attempt to underscore what he believes is an
absurdity of Jews settling in Israel, Gadhafi asked, ``Why don't we
Moslems go to New York?''
   A Yugoslav delegate grumbled, ``His speech is a mockery of the
world we live in and of the non-aligned movement.''
   An Arab delegate commented, ``There is certainly something mad
about him, but some of his ideas were not so bad.''
   Both delegates spoke on condition of not being identified.
   Raul Castro, brother of President Fidel Castro, made attacks on
the United States a main theme of his address to the conference,
which was attended by about 50 heads of state and about a dozen
prime ministers from the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America.
   Castro accused Washington of ``aggression'' against Panama and
called it ``a crime we cannot tolerate,'' according to an English
version of his speech made available by Cuba's Prensa Latina news
agency.
   ``The United States, the major imperialist power, is behaving
today more arrogantly, threateningly and aggressively than ever
before.''
   He said Cuba is ``now being subjected to an unprecedented
defamation campaign and new plans for penetration and subversion''
by the United States.
   The United Nations' Perez de Cuellar was in Belgrade for the
summit and met Tuesday with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
   In remarks later to reporters, Aziz charged that Iran rejects
peace talks with Iraq on settling the Persian Gulf war.
   Talks between Iran and Iraq, held under U.N. auspices, collapsed
last March.
   The two countries' 8-year border war ended inconclusively with a
cease-fire in August 1988.
   On Monday, de Cuellar met with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati, who insisted Iran was willing to resume the talks.

   Salvadoran rebels said Tuesday they have
proposed talks with the new rightist government to end El Salvador's
civil war and that negotiations begin next week.
   There was no immediate response from the Salvadoran government,
but it did announce a 48-hour cease-fire.
   The announcements followed a fierce pre-dawn battle in
northeastern El Salvador in which at least 16 soldiers were killed.
   Armed Forces spokesmen reported the deaths after the fighting
outside Chilanga in Morazan province. They said the rebels also
suffered ``numerous casualties'' but gave no number.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which represents
five left-wing guerrilla groups fighting El Salvador's U.S.-backed
government, called for talks to be held in Mexico starting sometime
between next Sunday and Thursday _ Sept. 10-Sept. 14.
   Col. Inocente Montano, the vice minister of defense, said Tuesday
the armed forces would observe a cease-fire Sept. 14-15 as part of
the celebration marking Central America's independence from Spain on
Sept. 15, 1821.
   Montano did not mention the rebels' proposal for peace talks but
told reporters the cease-fire ``is a positive initiative ... as long
as it is respected by the FMLN,'' the Spanish initials for the
guerrillas's front.
   A cease-fire for the independence festivities had been suggested
on Monday by the Permanent Committee of the National Debate for
Peace, an organization representing more than 70 church, union,
humanitarian and civic groups.
   It the government agrees to the proposed peace negotiations it
would be the first meeting between the two sides since President
Alfredo Cristiani of the conservative Republican Nationalist
Alliance suggested talks at his inauguration June 1. The guerrillas
agreed at that time but the effort snagged on the mechanics of
arranging the dialogue.
   ``We're taking away practically all obstacles,'' said Ana
Guadalupe Martinez, a rebel commander. ``We're making it the easiest
thing in the world.''
   In a significant softening of their previous conditions, she said
the front would bargain with any committee the government names.
   Before, the rebels had insisted that an army representative and
high-level officials be at the negotiating table. They rejected one
delegation the government considered on grounds its members would
not have the power to negotiate.
   The front suggested the dates and Mexico as a site for the talks
in a proposal sent Friday to Cristiani through Monsignor Arturo
Rivera Damas, the archbishop of San Salvador, Ms. Martinez told a
news conference in Mexico City.
   She added the front has not received a reply from the government.
   But she said the FMLN had received an unacceptable response to a
proposal that the government release all wounded rebel it is holding
as prisoners.
   Ms. Martinez said the proposal was made through Rivera Damas and
the government replied that it would release the wounded prisoners
if the rebels stopped sabotaging electrical installations and their
bans on transportation.
   ``That point was not negotiable,'' she said.
   Mario Lopez, another rebel commander, said new steps would be
announced Thursday.
   ``Commanders will make public a series of measures to create an
atmosphere of confidence for the negotiations,'' Lopez told
reporters.
   He did not elaborate but there was speculation the offers might
include a cease-fire.
   In the past the guerrillas have opposed a unilateral cease-fire,
saying a truce would have be to be negotiated at the bargaining
table.
   The FMLN, in its proposal for talks next week, again demanded
Rivera Damas be present during negotiations.
   Cristiani has said the archbishop should not be involved in the
talks.
   The FMLN also has insisted that delegates from the Organization
of American States and United Nations be present.
   Lopez said rebel representatives met Monday in Costa Rica with
OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares and Francisco Bandrel, a
U.N. representative.
   Three rounds of talks with the government of former President
Jose Napoleon Duarte between 1984 and 1987 failed to make progress
toward ending the nearly 10-year-old war. Duarte headed a centrist
Christian Democrat government.
   An estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the fighting.

   Colombian President Virgilio Barco,
in a message to the Belgrade summit of non-aligned nations, appealed
to the industrialized world to help his country in its war on drug
cartels.
   His speech was prepared for delivery early Wednesday by Foreign
Minister Julio Londono _ at about the same time President Bush
announced in Washington a $7.9 billion program to fight the illegal
drug trade.
   An English translation of Barco's message was made available to
the news media.
   Barco said he ``decided to cancel his visit to this summit in
order to deal, personally and directly, with an unprecedented
offensive against the scourge of drug trafficking ...''
   ``The struggle against the illegal drug traffic will only be won
in a definite way when every country assumes the responsibilities
they share,'' the message said, adding:
   ``Colombia has already paid a huge price and has made an enormous
sacrifice.
   ``Luis Carlos Galan, Colombian senator and candidate for the
presidency of the republic, who was recently assassinated in Bogota,
is but another one of the hundreds of martyrs fallen in this
struggle.''
   Galan, an outspoken foe of drug trafficking, was slain by cartel
henchmen while addressing a campaign rally Aug. 18. His murder
brought a declaration of war against the drug barons and a promise
of aid by the Bush administration.
   Barco said in his message that expressions of solidarity from the
international community is not enough in the battle, concrete action
must be taken.
   He called for ``serious and resolute actions designed to stop
drug consumption in industrialized countries.''
   ``We cannot by any means accept that, while Colombia fights a
most hard and widespread battle against this ominous trafficking,
drugs are currently sold in the streets of the main cities in the
developed world, under the tolerance of both inhabitants and local
authorities,'' Barco declared.
   ``Every nation must urgently assume, without hesitation, its
responsibility in this struggle,'' he added. ``Otherwise, what we,
the Colombian people and its government, are accomplishing, will
enter history not only as an example of heroic behavior, but
unfortunately also as an unfruitful sacrifice.''
   ``Colombia is making heroic efforts to destroy an important link
of the organization that corrupts millions of youngsters of Latin
America, Europe, the United States of America and other regions of
the world,'' the message said.
   ``We have given our help to their children and we shall continue
to do so. But the time has now come for others, especially the
industrialized countries, to give their help to Colombia and to our
children.''
   Venezuela announced Tuesday it would extradite any Colombian drug
lords entering the country to escape the anti-drug operations under
way in neighboring Colomba.
   Police director Mauro Yanez told a news conference in Caracas
that police, national guardsmen and army troops are patrolling the
border to prevent ``extraditables'' _ the chieftains of the drug
cartels _ from crossing into Venezuela.
   If they enter and are captured they ``will undergo a judicial
process that includes extradition, naturally,'' Yanez said.
   Barco, in his declaration of war against the drug dealers, said
he would use emergency powers to extradite to the United States
Colombians wanted there for drug trafficking.
   The drug cartels responded by threatening to kill 10 Colombian
officials for each person extradited to America to stand trial.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ...First, the good.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As you can see in the chart, in 1985, the government estimated
that 23 million Americans were using drugs on a ``current'' basis _
that is, at least once in the preceding month.
   Last year, that number fell by more than a third. That means
almost 9 million fewer Americans are casual drug users. Good news.
   Because we changed our national attitude toward drugs, casual
drug use has declined. We have many to thank: our brave
law-enforcement officers, religious leaders, teachers, community
activists, and leaders of business and labor.
   We should also thank the media for their exhaustive news and
editorial coverage and, for the air time and space for anti-drug
messages.
   Finally, I want to thank President and Mrs. Reagan for their
leadership. All of these good people told the truth _ that drug use
is wrong and dangerous.
   But as much comfort as we can draw from these dramatic
reductions, there is also bad news _ very bad news.
   Roughly 8 million people have used cocaine in the past year,
almost 1 million of them used it frequently once a week or more.
   What this means is that, in spite of the fact that overall
cocaine use is down, frequent use has almost doubled in the last few
years. And that's why habitual cocaine users _ especially crack
users _ are the most pressing, immediate drug problem.
   What, then, is our plan?
   To begin with, I trust the lesson of experience: No single policy
will cut it, no matter how glamorous or magical it may sound. To win
that war against addictive drugs like crack will take more than just
a federal strategy. It will take a national strategy, one that
reaches into every school, every workplace, involving every family.
   Earlier today, I sent this document, our first such national
strategy to the Congress. It was developed with the hard work of our
nation's first drug policy director, Bill Bennett.
   In preparing this plan, we talked with state, local and community
leaders, law enforcement officials and experts in education, drug
prevention and rehabilitation. We talked with parents and kids. We
took a long hard look at all that the federal government has done
about drugs in the past. What's worked, and _ let's be honest _ what
hasn't.
   Too often, people in government acted as if their part of the
problem _ whether fighting drug production, or drug smuggling, or
drug demand _ was the only problem. But turf battles won't win this
war. Teamwork will.
   Tonight, I'm announcing a strategy that reflects the coordinated,
cooperative commitment of all federal agencies. In short, this plan
is as comprehensive as the problme. With this strategy, we now
finally have a plan that coordinates our resources, our programs and
the people who run them.
   Our weapons in this strategy are: the law and criminal justice
system, our foreign policy, our treatment systems, and our schools
and drug prevention programs.
   So the basic weapons we need are the ones we already have. What
has been lacking is a strategy to effectively use them.
   Let me address four of the major elements of our strategy.
   First, we are determined to enforce the law, to make our streets
and neighborhoods safe. So to start, I'm proposing that we more than
double federal assistance to state and local law enforcement.
Americans have a right to safety in and around their homes.

   Call your local drug prevention program. Be a Big Brother or
Sister to a child in need. Pitch in with your local Neighborhood
Watch program. Whether you give your time or talent, everyone counts.
   Every employer who bans drugs from the workplace.
   Every school that's tough on drug use.
   Every neighborhood in which drugs are not welcome.
   And most important, every one of you who refuses to look the
other way. Every one of you counts.
   Of course, victory will take hard work and time. But together we
will win _ too many young lives are at stake.
   Not long ago, I read a newspaper story about a little boy named
Dooney, who, until recently, lived in a crack house in a suburb of
Washington, D.C. In Dooney's neighborhood, children don't flinch at
the sound of gunfire. And when they play, they pretend to sell to
each other small white rocks they call crack.
   Life at home was so cruel that Dooney begged his teachers to let
him sleep on the floor at school. And, when asked about his future,
6-year-old Dooney answers, ``I don't want to sell drugs, but I will
probably have to.''
   Well, Dooney does not have to sell drugs. No child in America
should have to live like this. Together, as a people, we can save
these kids. We have already transformed a national attitude of
tolerance into one of condemnation. But the war on drugs will be
hard-won, neighborhood by neighborhood, block by block, child by
child.
   If we fight this war as a divided nation, then the war is lost.
But if we face this evil as a nation united, this will be nothing
but a handful of useless chemicals.
   Victory. Victory over drugs is our cause, a just cause, and with
your help, we are going to win.

   The number of Chinese students at U.S.
colleges this fall has dropped sharply, but those remaining still
feel the legacy of protest from this summer's quest for democracy at
Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   ``TV forgets you but people don't,'' Liu Yuan, president of The
China Information Center here, said Tuesday.
   ``Television needs a hot story, but actually that's not how
changing a system really works,'' Liu said. ``That's not how a
movement grows.''
   Students in the Boston area include Wu'er Kaixi of Harvard
University and Shen Tong of Brandeis University, exiled leaders of
the democracy movement who've been on the Chinese government's
most-wanted list since the student demonstrations in Tiananmen
Square in June.
   In the months following the crackdown on protesters, martial law
has been imposed, many demonstrators have been jailed or executed
and Western journalists in China have had a tough time getting
people to talk.
   But The China Information center, which was set up in this Boston
suburb, still receives more than 200 calls daily, and volunteers
still work around the clock relaying messages to and from contacts
in Western Europe, Japan and Australia.
   China Center volunteer David Blumental, who was one of the
protesters near Shanghai in June, said true reform would only come
by applying quiet, but constant, external pressure on the government.
   ``The focus has moved outside of China, as has the main
leadership,'' he said. ``The focus has moved to activities that will
promote the flow of the truth back and forth out of China.''
   Organizers here are planning a worldwide fast for Oct. 1, the
40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China,
and conferences to debate the issues concerning the reform movement.
   Student activists in China went underground after the crackdown,
but many have returned to campuses there and face arrest.
   ``They're in a dangerous position,'' Liu said. ``We can't push
too much. The only way we can hurt the Chinese government is to tell
the truth.''
   The government has made it difficult for the story to get out. In
addition to the crackdown, the number of students granted visas for
study abroad has been dramatically reduced, U.S. State Department
officials said Tuesday.
   Chinese Embasssy and State Department officials in Washington
said they could not immediately pin down the number of visas issued
since June, but State Department spokesman Kenneth Bailes said it
had dropped.
   ``After the events in Tiananmen Square the government required
that those who had been previously issued such documents had to
apply for new ones,'' Bailes said. ``That in itself would cut down
on the number who actually got visas.''
   Bailes said that while no firm figures are available, the
impression persists that up to half the 40,000 Chinese who were
studying in the United States last year may not have returned.
   At Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, only two of
the six Chinese students expected showed up for a summer fellowship
program. About half of the 80 students originally expected at the
University of California at Berkeley will attend this fall, said
Marvin Baron, director of the school's international office.
   ``I know a lot of people who were planning on coming, but only
know of one who got out,'' Blumental said.

   Immigration officials blocked the
court-ordered release Tuesday of former Mexican President Luis
Echeverria's brother-in-law, who was being held in federal jail for
questioning in the 1985 slaying of a U.S. drug agent.
   The surprise turn of events came hours after a federal judge said
he did not believe Ruben Zuno Arce was a material witness to the
slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena.
   Zuno-Arce, who had wept when the judge announced his finding, was
grim faced later as he was led out of court by U.S. Marshals for
transport to San Antonio, Texas, for an immigration hearing.
   Zuno-Arce, 59, whose sister is married to Echeverria, was held on
an immigration warrant alleging he is involved in drug trafficking.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie, who had ordered Zuno
released after 28 days in custody, said he was powerless to
interfere with INS.
   Zuno-Arce's attorney, Edward Medvene, denied the drug trafficking
allegations. At the earlier hearing, Medvene had argued that his
client had nothing to do with the slaying, but had the misfortune of
having a house that was ultimately sold to reputed drug lord Rafael
Caro Quintero, who allegedly masterminded the slaying of Camarena.
   The government had sought to keep Zuno-Arce in prison in order to
ensure his testimony at the upcoming trial of Juan Jose Bernabe
Ramirez, who is the latest defendant charged in the Camarena case.
His trial is scheduled for Oct. 3. Prosecutors argued to keep
Zuno-Arce in custody until then. The judge refused.
   Camarena and his Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala-Avelar, were
tortured and killed in Guadalajara, Mexico, in February 1985. Their
bodies were found four weeks later in a remote area of Michoacan
state.
   Zuno-Arce was not charged with any crime, but in mid-August
Rafeedie ordered him temporarily held without bail. The judge had
warned prosecutors he would not allow the indefinite imprisonment of
Zuno-Arce.
   Several members of the Mexican federal police force were linked
to the killings and one, Raul Lopez Alvarez, was convicted in Los
Angeles last year along with two drug traffickers.
   Caro-Quintero is in custody awaiting trial in Mexico City. Seven
more men are charged with murder and conspiracy in the case.
   Echeverria was president of Mexico from 1970 to 1976.

<TEXT>
   Lima and much of Peru was blacked out Tuesday
night, minutes before President Bush gave a tough speech that
promised to crack down on drug traffickers throughout the Andes.
   The blackout was the sixth since June, most of which have been
caused by leftist rebels blowing up high-tension power pylons. The
Shining Path, known to operate in league with drug barons, has been
fighting to topple Peru's elected government since 1980.
   Bush's speech was to be broadcast live by radio in Peru, but the
radio station that was to carry the speech instead carried reports
on the blackout.
   According to radio reports, the blackout affected cities as far
north as Chiclayo, about 400 miles north of Lima, as well cities in
the Andean highlands.
   Shining Path started its insurgency near the highland city of
Ayacucho, but now operates through much of the Andes. It also
operates throughout the Upper Huallaga Valley, which produces about
60 percent of the world's coca crop. The rebels provide drug
traffickers with protection from the police and permission to do
business in the area in exchange for a portion of their drug profits.
   Early radio reports said police had reinforced personnel near the
U.S. Embassy to prevent terrorist attacks in the blackout. No
incidents were reported late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Bush Announces $7.9 Billion War on Drugs, `Our Gravest Domestic Threat'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, calling drugs ``the gravest
domestic threat facing our nation,'' Tuesday night proposed a $7.9
billion war on narcotics emphasizing harsher penalties for users and
more money for prisons, treatment and education.
   Bush warned Latin American drug lords that ``the rules have
changed'' and for the first time pledged U.S. military help to any
government that requests it in an all-out assault against drugs.
   ``Drugs are sapping our strength as a nation,'' the president
said in his first nationally televised address from the Oval Office.
He punctuated his speech by displaying a plastic bag of crack
cocaine seized across the street from the White House.
   To attack cocaine at its source, Bush proposed a four-fold
increase in the amount of military and law enforcement aid for
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru, to $261.2 million in 1990. He called it
the downpayment on a $2 billion, five-year program for the Andean
region, with more aid contingent on progress in eradicating drugs.
   At home, Bush called for a battle fought ``neighborhood by
neighborhood, block by block, child by child,'' and sought a
crackdown against those who use drugs. Even casual users would pay,
by losing their driving privileges or spending time in
military-style boot camps.
   To help offset the cost of his program, Bush proposed diverting
$751 million from other programs, including juvenile justice,
housing, immigration and economic development.
   ``We can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxes
or adding to the budget deficit,'' he said.
   On Capitol Hill, Democrats greeted Bush's plan with restraint.
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said Bush was not seeking
enough money to mount a long-term assault, and said the program will
increase pressure for a tax increase.
   With cocaine and crack dealing creating violence and record
homicide rates across the country, Americans appear ready for a new
assault against drugs.
   A Gallup Poll released at the White House last month said a
record 27 percent of Americans consider drugs the most important
problem facing the nation, above poverty, the economy, the
environment and fear of war.
   ``All of us agree that the gravest domestic threat facing our
nation today is drugs,'' Bush said.
   Bush held up the bag of cocaine, and said it was as ``innocent
looking as candy.'' But the president added, ``If we fight this war
as a divided nation, then the war is lost. But if we face this evil
as a nation united, this will be nothing but a handful of useless
chemicals.''
   Although overall cocaine use is down, frequent use has almost
doubled in recent years. ``Roughly 8 million people have used
cocaine in the last year,'' the president said. Almost 1 million of
them used the drug at least once a week.
   Even before the speech, Bush's program was praised by the head of
the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Charles D.
Reynolds, who said in a statement that ``the criminal justice
recommendations of this report are responsive to critical needs.''
   However, Rep. Don Edwards, the Democratic chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee's civil rights subcommittee, said the plan
``proposes more of almost everything that hasn't worked _ more
arrests, more prisons, tougher sentences.''
   Delivering the Democratic response to Bush's address, Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden said, ``Quite frankly, the
president's plan is not tough enough, bold enough or imaginative
enough to meet the crisis at hand.''
   Key elements of Bush's plan:
   _Authorization of $1.6 billion for corrections, $250 million to
beef up the court system, $3.1 billion for law enforcement, $1.2
billion for prevention and education, and $925 million for treatment.
   _Funds for local law enforcement efforts would more than double,
to about $350 million, to finance a street-level attack on drugs.
   _States were urged to adopt stiffer fines for casual drug users,
from seizing users' cars and suspending drivers' licenses to sending
some offenders to military-style camps.
   _As a condition for receiving federal funds, schools, colleges
and universities would be required to adopt drug prevention programs.
   _States and local governments, as well as private institutions
and companies, were urged to adopt drug testing programs for
employes. Drug testing would be mandatory for federal arrestees,
prisoners and parolees for illegal drug use.
   _The nation's insurance companies were urged to cover drug
treatment programs in their policies but he stopped short of
proposing mandatory standards.
   He also called for studying ways that drug users could be
committed to hospitals and other facilities for treatment without
being charged with crimes.
   Bush emphasized the toll in the nation's poorest communities by
targeting $50 million to ``fight crime in public housing projects.''
   ``You know,'' Bush said, ``The poor have never had it easy in
this world. But in the past, they weren't mugged on the way home
from work by crack gangs. And their children didn't have to dodge
bullets on the way to school.''
   In a report to Congress, Bush called for ``full swift funding and
implementation of the many proposals and initiatives'' in his plan.
   ``There's no question but that drugs are (the) quicksand of our
entire society,'' Bush said in an afternoon meeting with his
Cabinet. ``They're suffocating individuals and families and
institutions as well.
   ``And all Americans must pull together to solve this problem,''
the president said. Bush said his program, mandated by Congress,
amounted to ``the first time we really have had such a strategy.''
   Bush's program would authorize spending $2.2 billion in 1990
above the current anti-drug war chest of $5.7 billion. More than
half of the increase _ $1.2 billion _ is earmarked for a previously
announced expansion of federal prison cells.
   Actual outlays to carry out the program in 1990 would be $6.4
billion, an increase of $1.5 billion over the amount already
earmarked. The higher figure of $7.9 billion also includes budget
authority for additional spending on multi-year programs.
   The 1989 funds for the Andean region are separate from the $65
million worth of military equipment and aid that Bush authorized
this month for Colombia to combat a new, bloody offensive by the
country's drug barons. Bush once again praised Colombian president
Virgilio Barco for his crackdown, and reiterated his call for an
international drug summit.

   A Finnish tanker and a Soviet trawler
collided in the Baltic early Wednesday and 14 of the trawler's 15
crew members were missing, the Tingstade Coastal radio station
reported.
   The one known survivor, the trawler's radio officer, was reported
badly hurt.
   Tingstade radio operator Richard Warff said the Swedish navy
reported finding four empty life rafts.
   The collision took place south of the Swedish island of Gotland
and the Soviet trawler Ladushkin sank soon after, the radio station
said.
   Rescue team leader Mats Jakobsson of the Swedish navy reported
that chances of finding anyone alive were ``dim. They are decreasing
every minute.''
   Jakobsson, speaking to Swedish radio three hours after the
collision, said the 6,000-ton tanker Tebo Star veered to avoid
hitting another Soviet trawler when Ladushkin suddenly appeared in
front of the tanker.
   The Russian trawler Matrosova picked up one survivor more than an
hour after the collision, which took place at 13 minutes after
Tuesday midnight, the Tingstade station said.
   Swedish navy units, including helicopters, were quickly on the
scene to help in the search. The navy had been holding maneuvers in
the area.
   The survivor was taken to a Swedish east coast hospital by
helicopter, Warff said.
   The Finnish tanker immediately sent a Mayday message following
the collision.

   Democrats led by House Speaker Thomas Foley
said Tuesday the Bush administration's drug plan will increase
pressure for a tax boost, while Republicans praised the plan and
vowed to find the money somehow.
   ``It's very difficult to assume we can, at least over the long
term, meet the cost of the drug war without some additional revenue
coming into the government,'' Foley said after President Bush met
with congressional leaders.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., emerged from the White House meeting
to tell reporters there would ``be some differences about where the
money comes from, but we can get the money.''
   Bush described a $7.9 billion program stressing tougher penalties
for drug users and more money for prisons, treatment programs,
education and prevention.
   In his nationally televised speech outlining the plan, Bush said
Tuesday night that the government ``can pay for this fight against
drugs without raising taxes or adding to the budget deficit.''
   ``We have submitted our plan to Congress that shows just how to
fund it within the limits of our bipartisan budget agreement,'' Bush
said.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said, however, that Bush ``has
suggested only $716 million in offsets to finance a $2 billion
program. He has missed the mark there.'' He said much broader budget
offsets in programs such as the B2 bomber and foreign aid would be
needed to do the job.
   Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., issued a
statement saying that ``what we don't need now is instant criticism
and nitpicking about what's wrong with the president's plan.''
   ``Congress helps spend about $1 trillion every year, so I feel
confident we can find enough funding to fuel our war on drugs,''
Dole said. ``I just don't believe we have to raise taxes to pay for
it. This is a war on drugs, not a war on the American taxpayer.''
   Initial reaction among local officials around the nation, notably
police chiefs, was welcoming _ but these officials said they could
not be optimistic about an easy victory.
   Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, who last year called for legalizing
drugs, said it was too early to judge Bush's strategy.
   ``We ought to be a little bit careful because this is the third
time now cinse 1972 a president has launched an all-out war against
drugs,'' Schmoke said.
   Foley said Bush outlined $700 million in budget transfers to pay
for the plan and ``didn't seem to suggest any new taxes, I think
that's fair to say.''
   ``Over time, I think, some of us feel that in order to deal with
the entire functioning of government we're going to need some
additional revenues,'' Foley added.
   House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., suggested that a
transfer of funds should work for the first year of the drug war
``and after that, we're going to have to take a look at it ...
because it's not going to be won in one year. And it will be a
costly venture when it's over.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., emerged from the session complaining
about plans to obtain the money through transfers. ``It just seems
unfair to me to be unfair to declare war and tell the Congress to
come back and pick up the money without talking about taxes or
without talking about waiving (the) Gramm-Rudman'' deficit reduction
law.
   ``To say that we've declared war and develop a domestic policy
and a foreign policy and then we have to go back and nickle and dime
from the different committees to raise $700 million, to me it just
doesn't seem as though we're sincere,'' Rangel said.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
delivering the Democratic response, said that the Bush plan ``is not
tough enough, bold enough or imaginative enough.'' He called for a
much broader attack, including an international team to hunt down
drug kingpins.
   ``There must be no safe haven for these narco-terrorists,'' Biden
said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said: ``I commend President Bush
for the comprehensive strategy he has announced in the war on drugs
... the phony war of the past eight years is over.'' But he added:
   ``In my view, substantially more federal resources are needed ...
to make our national strategy more credible.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said that ``unless the president
supports the tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war,
the drug dealers are going to win.''
   ``As despicable as drug dealers are, they understand economics,''
Rostenkowski said. ``If you want to play, you've got to pay.''
   Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., expressed ``strong support'' for
what he called ``a comprehensive plan and challenge to the nation.''
   ``Hopefully, an overwhelming majority of Americans are prepared
to reject totally the use of narcotics and to help relieve the
suffering of those previously addicted,'' he said. He also praised
Bush for offering aid to South American nations attempting to
curtail cocaine production.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said he was ``glad the president
has gone beyond sloganeering ... but the best kept secret in town is
how we pay for it.''
   ``It will take more than one speech,'' Leahy said. ``We need
presidential leadership along with the financial commitment to
finish the job.''
   In the House, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., was critical of the
Bush blueprint, saying ``it isn't really a war on drugs. It's barely
a skirmish against drugs.''
   He called for a 1 percent surtax on individual and corporate
income taxes, saying there was no question that voters would support
it as a way to fight the drug war. ``People from one end of America
to the other will,'' he said, ``if they know where the money is
going.''

   An outbreak of cholera in China's far western
province of Xinjiang has killed at least six people and 796 others
have been stricken, the official China Daily newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   It said the disease hit 17 southern counties in the remote,
mountainous province. It blamed contaminated water and said a
prolonged drought had aggravated the problem.
   The local public health department said about 2.2 million rural
Xinjiang residents drink unclean water.
   The Public Health Ministry said China registered 89 deaths from
cholera in 1988. Most are believed to have occurred in Xinjiang.
   The China Daily also reported an outbreak of polio in coastal
Jiangsu province, with 440 cases reported between February and
August. It said 29 Jiangsu children had died.
   In all of China last year, 584 cases of polio were reported, the
paper said.
   Ten years ago, China had as many as 10,000 polio victims a year.
Authorities have said China hopes to eliminate polio by 1995.
However, an immunization program has covered only about 60 percent
of the nation's children, the Health Ministry said last year.

<HEAD>Report Says Up to 700 Dead in Blast at Iraqi Defense Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British newspaper reported Wednesday that up to
700 Iraqis and Egyptians died in an explosion Aug. 17 at a secret
Iraqi missile center near the capital of Baghdad.
   The Independent, quoting unidentified diplomats and Middle East
sources, said Iraq, with Egyptian assistance, is believed to be
developing missile technology at the center near Al Hillah, 40 miles
south of Baghdad.
   The report said the explosion caused a fire that took
firefighting planes nearly a week to extinguish. But it said no
reports of the disaster had appeared in the official Iraqi news
media.
   The London newspaper quoted U.S. diplomats as saying they had
received information from Iraqi sources of a major incident in the
second half of August in which the casualty toll numbered in the low
hundreds.
   But it quoted unspecified sources as saying that 700 bodies had
been recovered. It quoted the other sources as saying the blast
destroyed a third of the huge center, which contained workers'
housing as well as armament factories.
   The paper said there was no immediate suggestion of sabotage.
   ``The casualties appear to have included Egyptian military and
civilian engineers as well as Iraqi defense workers,'' The
Independent said. ``Sources in Cairo said that three Egyptian Air
Force transports flew from Iraq to the al-Mazha air base on 18
August, apparently carrying dead and injured from the explosion ...
   ``Egyptian sources said the Maadi military hospital in Cairo was
closed to civilian visitors from 19 August and doctors and nurses
specializing in skin grafts, respiratory disorders and burns were
drafted in.''
   The paper said Egyptian personnel have been based in Iraq for two
years.
   It reported: ``The joint Egyptian-Iraqi team succeeded in
producing a longer-range version of the Soviet-made Scud-B missile
by adding a North Korean-made supplementary fuel tank and reducing
the payload...
   ``The team also developed the Badr-2000, an improved version of
the Argentine Condor-2. By early 1988, the Egyptians managed to
increase the range of the missile to over 500 miles. But it has
proved notoriously inaccurate.''

   Seven American veterans of the Vietnam
War met Tuesday with Gen. Manuel Antonio Notiega and one of them,
Phillip Jones, later told reporters they expressed ``a wish for
peace'' to the Panamanian leader.
   Also at the meeting was provisional President Francisco
Rodriguez, who took office Sept. 1. Rodriguez told the seven,
``Panama is a noble country, not an enemy of the American people,
but we want you to respect us.''
   Noriega, who was accompanied by five colonels, did not comment on
his talks with the veterans.
   The U.S. government does not recognize Rodriguez, viewing him as
a puppet of Noriega. The general, chief of Panama's Defense Forces,
has denied U.S. drug trafficking charges leveled against him last
year in Florida. Rodriguez took office to fill a vacuum created when
the government canceled May 7 elections, which foreign observers
said were won by the opposition.
   The veterans arrived Monday in Panama and are due to return
Wednesday to the United States. They were among foreign groups who
have expressed sympathy for Noriega's position.

   Assassins in a car riddled the chief
spokesman of the radical Leftist Revolutionary Movement with
submachine-gun fire, hitting him at least 12 times and killing him
instantly, police reported Tuesday.
   They said Jecar Neghme, 29, was shot at about 10 p.m. Monday as
he walked toward his group's headquarters in a residential
neighborhood near the city center.
   No one claimed responsability.
   The Movement, known as MIR, was organized in the mid-1960s by a
group of dissident young Communists and quickly became Chile's main
urban guerrilla organization.
   In recent years, the group split and a faction led by Neghme and
others abandoned armed struggle and was organizing as a formal
political party, still following a radical leftist line.

   President Bush's battle plan against drugs
sounded like a classroom lecture by a teacher who didn't know the
subject, addicts and counselors at a drug treatment center said
Tuesday.
   ``He's talking like he's talking to a bunch of schoolchildren,''
said Frank, 33, who is addicted to painkillers. He watched Bush's
speech on television at the Center for Chemical Dependency at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   ``He sounded like a third-grade schoolteacher,'' said Terry, 34,
who is battling heroin. ``He was banging those rocks on the table _
he didn't make it scary enough.''
   She referred to the plastic bag of rock cocaine the president
used as a prop during the speech.
   Frank, Terry and Richard _ who is an alcoholic _ watched the
speech in a room at the sprawling medical center, which has a 27-bed
voluntary treatment program. The patients asked to be identified
only by their first names.
   Dr. Ronald Gershman, the medical director of the unit, also
listened to Bush's speech.
   ``He made one big blunder, calling cocaine the nation's No. 1
drug problem,'' said Gershman, who has been treating addicts for 15
years. ``Alcoholism is the No. 1 drug in the nation. I think they
are being very narrow to focus all their attention on cocaine. It's
a scapegoat.''
   ``He talks about cocaine fields in Colombia _ how about the
California marijuana fields?'' Gershman said.
   Terry said Bush's plan to spend $925 million for treatment of
addicts was far too little.
   ``Treatment is expensive. Street addicts are not going to be able
to come to Cedars-Sinai ... and the state programs are a joke,'' she
said.
   ``The bottom lines on those programs is that they are
ineffectual,'' Gershman added. ``He missed the point. What he
outlined won't work. Drug treatment is labor-intensive and
expensive. It has to be recognized as a major medical problem.''
   All three patients agreed that employee insurance should be
mandated to cover drug treatment programs.

   More U.S. military aid was on its way
today to bolster the government in its fight against drug gangs,
which have battled back with bombings and are blamed for a bloody
attack at Medellin's airport.
   Five U.S. military helicopters were due to arrive today,
following weekend deliveries of two C-130 transport planes and eight
A-37 reconnaissance and attack jets.
   Medellin police said four bombs exploded Monday night in or near
the city _ home base of the world's most powerful cocaine cartel,
injuring two people.
   Officials blamed the drug barons for an attack in which a man in
a camouflage uniform fired an automatic rifle at a line of people
waiting outside the Medellin airport terminal, killing one man and
wounding 14 people before he was fatally shot by security forces.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu angrily
demanded the government apologize for allowing police to enter his
home church as they broke up rallies protesting the exclusion of
blacks from this week's elections.
   Tutu and fellow anti-apartheid activist the Rev. Allan Boesak
were detained for 90 minutes Monday after refusing to move away from
another Cape Town church when police blocked its door with an
armored truck.
   Police were trying to stop people from gathering at the church
for an anti-election rally.
   Tutu said he planned to hold a reconsecration service today at
St. George's Anglican Cathedral, where he officiates, because police
had entered and desecrated it on Monday.

   A diplomatic standoff delaying an
exodus of thousands of East German refugees from Hungary has left
the would-be emigres in the cold and West German relief workers in
the dark.
   In Budapest, Hungarian officials said they stalled a mass
emigration of East Germans to West Germany out of concern that East
Berlin might react angrily to the unauthorized release of its
citizens.
   The Hamburg-based weekly magazine Stern quoted Hungarian Interior
Minister Istvan Horvath as saying resolution of the refugee crisis
could take up to 1{ months, or until Bonn and East Berlin reach
agreement.
   The East German state-run news agency ADN reported Horvath's
remarks and also quoted East German Foreign Ministry spokesman
Wolfgang Meyer as repeating assurances that would-be emigres will
not face prosecution if they return.

   The government is cracking down on fraternal
groups, taverns, convenience store owners and other small businesses
that are behind _ one by 50 years _ on paying a federal tax on
liquor retailers.
   The tax was increased by 463 percent last year, from $54 to $250
for each establishment. Accompanying the increase was a vigorous
enforcement effort by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   The Elks Lodge 109 in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., was stunned to get a
bill 10 months ago for $9,776.98 from ATF representing unpaid taxes
and penalties back to 1940, when the lodge got its liquor license.
   The lodge, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary, said it
had never heard of the tax.

   ``My Children, My Africa,'' the
latest play by Athol Fugard, tells of a black teacher who stands for
reason and dies for it.
   The two-act work by South Africa's foremost dramatist is based on
a short newspaper article about the murder of a teacher during the
anti-government violence and school boycotts that spread through
black townships in 1984-87. A black man was hit over the head with
an iron rod and burned by a crowd of blacks.
   ``I didn't want to just write a play defending the old-style
traditionalist saying come back into the classroom. Saying
`liberation first, then education' is a suicidal slogan,'' Fugard
said in an interview after his play premiered at the Market Theater,
and before heading to Washington for the opening of ``The Road to
Mecca,'' his 1984 play.
   ``It would have also been too easy to have beaten my breast
(about) my disgust with mob violence,'' he said. ``It would have
been easier to just take a line of the young radical and just come
out with a statement of what it means to have to endure and suffer
the insult of a sick, third-class (education) system. But I had to
really encompass all three perspectives.''
   Fugard, 57, has written, produced, directed and sometimes acted
in a string of hits. Plays such as ``The Blood Knot,'' ``Master
Harold ... and the Boys'' and ``Hello and Goodbye'' have been
produced on Broadway and in London.
   The playwright may have attempted to give the views of his
characters equal weight. But an audience watching Tony Award-winning
actor John Kani's portrayal of the teacher cannot help but
sympathize with the wise, kindhearted Mr. M, whose dreams for his
favorite student go up in the flames that consume the old man and
his schoolhouse.
   Fugard even stacks the cards against Mr. M by making him guilty
of an isolated act of ``collaboration'' so out of character that it
stuns the audience as well as his student. It may be Fugard's
concession to certain left-wing circles in South Africa who cannot
believe that an innocent person could have been killed in the
``people's movement'' that engulfed the townships.
   Fugard said that Kani, ``a role model for the black community''
had to overcome important hurdles, and carefully explain to his
children that he was playing the part of ``a police informer.''
   ``Mr. M stands for reason in a situation where reason does not
necessarily count,'' Kani said in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``It's not a matter of being right or wrong these days. It's
a matter of being with the right side.''
   Fugard wrote the part specifically for Kani, whose masterful
performance has been uniformly praised. But the lengthy, sometimes
tedious structure of the play has been criticized.
   ``Student activism and the comrades (who controlled the townships
during the unrest) would provide any dramatist with the ingredients
for a terse, articulate, 90-minute drama, which I do believe is
lurking somewhere, hidden in the voluminous dullness of this current
production,'' wrote critic Barry Ronge of Johannesburg's Sunday
Times.
   The play is three hours long, half of it consumed in the first
act by philosophical lectures from Mr. M, his top student, Thami,
and a white girl who becomes Thami's partner in a literature
competition disrupted by the black school boycott.
   ``The first act, particularly, makes one feel somewhat harangued
and needs a lot of tightening,'' said Rina Minervini, critic for
Johannesburg's Sunday Star.
   ``The play is largely structured along the lines of a debate.
There are long, tired monologs,'' said The New Nation, a leftist
black newspaper. But, it added, ``The debate he raises is a vital
one.''
   Kani, 46, describes himself as a revolutionary. ``But I can't
throw stones at the moment, so I decided to turn my art into a
weapon to fight the system.''
   His character, Mr. M, feels the same way about education. He
knows that in South Africa, black schools are substandard, but he
believes ignorance and illiteracy are not the answer.
   ``Unfortunately, he's dealing with the angry youth,'' Kani said,
``the youth who see him with these ideas as a collaborator because
the struggle has drawn a line: You are either with us or you are not
with us. It doesn't allow you to be an observer. It doesn't allow
you to be neutral. It doesn't allow you even to want to think in a
way that would be identified as the other side.
   ``The youth says, `No more talk. We do.' Mr. M takes his chance
by saying, `I will stand for what I believe in,' and he dies.''

   The 1980s burned through a lot of fads, but
MTV: Music Television has refused to join the trendsetter trash heap.
   Growing stagnant, MTV and its music-video format have been
revamped from top to bottom, and have emerged on its eighth
anniversary as one of television's more robust and diverse
enterprises.
   In the wake of a two-year overhaul spread across MTV and its two
affiliated channels _ VH-1 and Nickelodeon-Nick at Nite _ MTV
Networks now features a mix of game shows, children's programs,
newscasts, dance shows, sitcom reruns and rap music.
   MTV's archly irreverent ``Remote Control'' quiz show has become
so popular that it's now a hit in the TV syndication market.
Nickelodeon, jammed with offbeat children's shows, will deliver
2,343 episodes this year, an increase of more than 300 percent since
1986.
   After losing about $50 million in its first two years, MTV
Networks now has a combined subscriber base of 125 million viewers,
MTV says, and a growing following overseas. Earnings for the three
channels through the second quarter of this year were up 21 percent
from a year ago, to $17.9 million.
   All the same, MTV's evolution has been clumsy at times, and the
future is dotted with challenges. Even after a redesign, soft-rock
VH-1 still attracts meager ratings. And Nick at Nite has yet to
become more than a rest home for old sitcoms.
   In the coming months both MTV and Home Box Office will introduce
all-comedy cable channels.
   ``We think a comedy channel is a real logical next step for us,''
said Tom Freston, MTV Network's president and chief executive
officer. ``But I think that you probably will see only one (comedy
channel) surviving.''
   With HA!, as MTV's comedy channel will be called, MTV will be
chasing the competition.
   ``I think that what we're doing is unique and innovative and what
they're doing is already available on other cable channels,'' said
Dick Beahrs, president of HBO's Comedy Channel.
   The Comedy Channel, which debuts in November, will be composed of
brief comedy sketches culled from movies and nightclub performances,
complemented by occasional feature-length films and sitcoms. HA!,
using longer-form program packages, premieres April 1.
   MTV's other channels continue to be reworked. VH-1, now 4 years
old, faces perhaps the most difficult battle.
   Freston labels VH-1 ``a work in progress.'' A few cable operators
have called it something else: unnecessary.
   When the Consumer News and Business Channel began in April,
several cable systems bumped VH-1 to make room at a cost of nearly a
million subscribers, according to CNBC. MTV, however, says it's
closer to 250,000.
   VH-1's problem is that it is still seen as the drydock for MTV
flotsam. ``It was a repository for everything MTV didn't want to
play,'' Freston said. ``And it still has a way to go.''
   VH-1 these days offers an eclectic musical blend of artists such
as Enya, Fine Young Cannibals, 10,000 Maniacs and Edie Brickell &amp;
New Bohemians. Gone for good, VH-1 promises, are Julio Iglesias and
Neil Diamond.
   The channel also has added lifestyle reports, entertainment news,
nostalgia programming such as ``My Generation'' and the Sunday jazz
show ``New Visions.'' A new comedy program will join the VH-1 lineup
this fall.
   ``What music videos did to music, we can do to information and
entertainment,'' said Ed Bennett, VH-1's president. Ratings have yet
to take off.
   John Reardon, the new president of MTV, echoed the theme of
diversifying as he explained the burst of packaged shows now
arriving on MTV's schedule: ``Clearly, we've been trying to keep the
viewer interested longer.''
   So MTV's videos from acts such as Bon Jovi, Madonna and Prince
are being supplemented by the dance program ``Club MTV,'' the rap
show ``Yo! MTV Raps,'' ``Monty Python's Flying Circus,'' regular
news broadcasts, occasional concerts and a variety of other original
programs including ``Remote Control.''
   Among other projects discussed for MTV's future are a daily soap
opera, at least two movies and a music-rating show.
   Originally a property of Warner-Amex, Nickelodeon is MTV's oldest
property at age 10. Its gross ad billings have grown from $31.8
million in 1988 to an estimated $48.2 million this year, according
to Paul Kagan and Associates.
   The children's service, which switches to the sitcom-heavy ``Nick
at Nite'' at 8 p.m. in most time zones, offers whimsical programming
such as the messy game show ``Double Dare,'' the legal send-up
``Kids' Court'' and the talk show ``Don't Just Sit There.''
   ``We're always trying to stay as close to kids as we can,'' said
Geraldine Laybourne, president of Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite.
``And we believe that they deserve a full entertainment network.
Everything doesn't have to be a ratings hit.''
   Among the new shows being added to the network's schedule are
``Eureeka's Castle,'' an ambitious daily series for preschoolers,
and ``Hey Dude,'' a weekly situation comedy set at a dude ranch. A
children's cooking show, a daily news program and a soap opera also
are being planned.
   And then there's Nick at Nite.
   Although Nick at Nite's been around since 1985, its first
original program _ a spoof review show called ``On the Television''
_ was just announced this July. Other than that, Nick at Nite
consists of reruns of such ancient sitcoms as ``Mr. Ed,'' ``My Three
Sons'' and ``Laugh-In.''
   Laybourne conceded, ``We have to have something on the network
where if (audiences) don't watch tonight, they're going to miss it.''

<BYLINE>Should Broker-Client Conversations Be Taped? ^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If brokers really want to improve their image
they might consider recording all conversations with their clients.
   To do so would provide a service to themselves and their clients,
says James B. Cloonan. It might protect each of them. It would tend
to limit deceit and even the mild puffery that can lead to
misunderstandings, he says.
   The idea is also likely to set off a backlash, especially from
sales people expert in the arts and nuances of enticing investors
into stocks they could do without. In effect, it would place every
conversation on the record.
   Cloonan, however, observes that the reputation of the industry,
battered in recent years by insider trading scandals, may be in need
of repairs to its image, and that electronic documentation can only
help.
   He has some experience in the field, being an adviser to the
Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, which has been
seeking ways to prevent fraud through legislation and electronic
surveillance.
   Most of that effort, however, has been involved with the major
insider trading scandals, and with indictments for fraud and various
securities law violations.
   Meanwhile, he says, another serious fraud persists. He calls it
``front-office fraud.'' It includes churning, unsuitable
recommendations, unauthorized trading and making unfulfillable
promises.''
   For various reasons, says Cloonan, who is president of the
110,000-member, Chicago-based American Association of Individual
Investors, these activities get much less attention from the legal
system and the media.
   ``While an individual involved in insider trading may go to
prison and pay a fine of millions of dollars, the broker who cheats
a retired person out of his life savings seems to get a short
suspension or a small fine,'' he says.
   Cloonan, a former professor, thinks so highly of the need for
recording broker conversations that he wrote an editorial on the
subject for the AAII Journal. Front-office fraud must be more
vigorously prosecuted, he says.
   He believes the reason prosecutions aren't as common in this area
is that so much boils down to a conversation involving only two
people. ``His word against hers, perhaps a misunderstanding _ who
knows?''
   As a consequence, criminal prosecution isn't likely, and civil
action or arbitration usually involves some kind of modest
settlement, and the punishments may be a temporary or permanent
suspension of broker privileges.
   ``I see reports of such behavior not only in boiler room
penny-stock operations, but in the better-known brokerage firms, as
well,'' he says. And, he adds, temptation may grow as retail brokers
incur profitability pressures.
   Of course, investors themselves could record conversations or
keep a journal. But, Cloonan believes, those individuals most likely
to be cheated are the least likely to do so. In his view, it should
be the broker's job.
   ``With today's technology I see no reason why conversations
shouldn't be recorded,'' he says. In fact, some discount stock and
commodity brokers already use such methods to record oral orders,
erasing the tapes after confirmation.
   The very existence of the recording would tend to place
constraints on exaggeration and fraud, and the recording would
provide evidence in cases where laws were violated. Customer and
sales person alike would benefit.
   ``It would be nice for investors to be able to prove what they
authorized,'' said Cloonan. ``And it would be nice for brokers to be
protected from unjust accusations from confused clients, when that
is the case.''

<HEAD>Television Exec Turns to Different Kind of Networking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TYLER, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of preparation and realigning his
family's multimillion dollar television business, Robert P. Buford
undertook a second career _ one that spends money instead of making
it but better fulfills the motto engraved on his desk nameplate:
``On A Mission For God.''
   Buford, a management aficionado, has turned from television to a
different kind of network _ Leadership Network _ where he brings
together pastors of large churches to talk about running their huge
organizations.
   ``We found that there's more ... in common or more similarity
between a (large) Methodist, a Presbyterian and a Bible church, or
charismatic church even, in the leadership function than there is
between a large church and a small church in the same
denomination,'' Buford said.
   The skills needed to run such an organization _ staffing,
organizing, motivating, budgeting _ are largely ignored in
seminaries and are usually treated as ``continuing education.''
   In the five years since Buford began his crusade to bring better
management to large churches _ those with more than 1,000 attending
weekly _ he has brought together the 400 senior pastors from various
denominations, plus other church and organizational staff in
separate meetings _ most of them at a conference center in Colorado
Springs, Colo.
   ``What we hope to accomplish is to provide an environment where
they could hear how to help one another operate in those
circumstances,'' Buford said, adding that there are 10,000 large
churches in the country.
   The discussions at the three-day long sessions generally revolve
around three areas, Buford said: how to set a vision so that the
church is cohesive, how to manage staff and how to retain their
personal, spiritual vitality.
   And it's all free, except for the transportation, because Buford
foots the bill.
   ``It struck me that a man's life does not consist of bread alone,
that I should live a life of service as well as a life of
accumulation,'' said Buford, a member of a midsized Episcopal church
where he teaches some Bible classes.
   ``I had, in my middle 30s, a clear desire to at some point lead a
life of service and I'll be 50 in September and I feel that I'm
embarking on that parallel career.''
   Buford is chairman and chief executive officer of Buford
Television Inc., which owns WMBB-TV, a VHF station in Panama City,
Fla., and cable systems in 120 cities and counties in six states.
   A private man, Buford has deliberately kept a low profile in his
own community; a recent interview at his office tucked away on a
wooded lot outside of Tyler is the only one he has given and he has
declined repeated offers to become involved in various local civic
organizations.
   Buford, who says his model is industrialist-philanthropist Andrew
Carnegie, only reluctantly agreed that he could be described as a
millionaire, although he owns a third of BTI.
   Buford said he has spent ``six or seven years'' preparing his
family and realigning BTI to allow him to spend about half his time
dealing with Leadership Network.
   Like Buford, Leadership Network has been almost invisible: there
is no advertising and participants in the invitation-only meetings
are recruited on recommendation from other pastors.
   Even at a retail cost of $279.80, Buford says he doesn't expect
to make a profit, and may even lose money, but that's OK.
   His leadership organization is branching out and joining forces
with management guru Peter F. Drucker, who has produced ``The
Non-Profit Drucker,'' a five-volume series of discussions with
leaders of non-profit organizations.
   Buford said he and Drucker believe the mission of a church may be
different from many non-profit institutions, ``but the management
issues are not.''
   In his latest book, ``The New Realities,'' Drucker extols the
place volunteerism, or ``the third sector,'' has in the nation's
economy.
   ``The third sector is actually the country's largest employer,
though neither its workforce nor the output it produces show up in
the statistics,'' Drucker writes.
   He estimates 90 million people work as volunteers, in addition to
their regular jobs. There are 979,000 non-profit organizations.
   Drucker says they are the fastest growing segment of American
society, and ``with this growth has come an urgent need for a
comprehensive resource geared specifically to management challenges
that the leaders of non-profit institutions face every day.''
   ``Management used to be a bad word in non-profit institutions. It
implied big business,'' Drucker says, adding that non-profits are
big business and must be held accountable.
   ``In the non-profit organization, we use other people's money _
the donors' money or tax money _ and we are accountable for it,''
Drucker says. ``The specific threat to the non-profit organization
is to become mired in mismanagement, through paper work, procedures
and myriad decision makers.''

   Government helicopters and
warplanes have stepped up attacks on suspected guerrilla positions
near towns in the northern war zone, but local civilians say the
rockets, bombs and bullets have hit homes in the area and left
civilians terrified.
   A nun said rockets hit near a school where a crowd of children
were at play.
   This town of 1,000 people in the heart of El Salvador's
rebel-dominated mountains was the only municipality to suffer direct
hits in raids Aug. 19-20. But inhabitants of surrounding hamlets are
angered and worried by the government's use of powerful weapons in
civilian areas.
   ``Only by the providence of God was none of the children
killed,'' Sister Teresa Racia said as she described a raid Aug. 19
that left rocket craters and strafing damage across town.
   She said more than 200 children were playing around the adobe
schoolhouse when a helicopter gunship arrived and one rocket crashed
into a hillside 60 yards away and a second just 15 yards away.
   Minutes after the U.S.-supplied UH-1M gunship blasted the
surrounding cornfields and hills, a C-47 warplane strafed Las Flores
with .50-caliber machine guns firing.
   ``The paving stones looked like they were exploding,'' said Elias
Menjivar, whose house was one of a dozen damaged. ``They were even
smoking.''
   Rev. Miguel Vasquez, a Roman Catholic priest in Arcatao, said an
A-37 dropped four bombs Aug. 20 at the nearby hamlet of Santa Rita,
damaging three houses.
   Peasant farmers Andres Cordova and Felipe Orellana said their
hamlet, Los Pozos, was strafed the same day.
   ``There was combat near the houses and they called in the
airplanes,'' Cordova said. ``Six houses were damaged. Everyone was
panic-stricken.''
   Orellana said, ``It seems the planes are coming more often and
closer to the houses, and it makes you afraid.''
   The air force says that air strikes are made only against
military targets. But in densely populated El Salvador few areas are
well away from civilians.
   Chalatenango Province is one of the most fought-over areas in the
nearly decade-old war between the 56,000-member, U.S.-supplied and
-trained armed forces and about 7,000 Marxist-led guerrillas.
   Air power is the armed forces' single biggest tactical advantage
over the rebels, who control a wide northern swath of the
Massachusetts-sized country.
   But the danger of catastrophic error _ such as a direct hit on
the Las Flores schoolhouse _ has increased lately because new
anti-aircraft weapons acquired by the guerrillas force government
pilots to attack from higher altitudes and therefore with less
accuracy.
   Since late last year, the rebels have received several hundred
Soviet-designed Dragunov sniper rifles. When used against aircraft,
the Dragunov's effective range of 3,000 feet obliges government
pilots to stay higher in the sky.
   The guerrillas also have obtained several thousand AK-47 rifles
and they have been trained to fire them at helicopters and aircraft
flying below 2,000 feet.
   While they rarely bring down aircraft, the groundfire wounds
crewmen and damages the aircraft. Pilots report taking more hits and
abandoning more missions than at any time in the war.

<HEAD>It's Business as Usual in Shanghai After Spring Protests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SHANGHAI, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's business as usual in Shanghai for
most of its 12 million people. A little more than two months since
pro-democracy demonstrations shook China, they go about making a
living, haggling in the markets, sitting around talking and playing
cards on the sidewalk.
   The people of China's most cosmopolitan city seem relaxed and
cheerful as they sit under the chestnut trees squeezed between tall
gray walls and bustling, narrow streets.
   ``Things are about the same as before here,'' said one man,
sitting outside the electronics factory where he works. ``We all get
the same salary no matter how hard we work, so we're taking it
easy.''
   Like Beijing, Shanghai was hit by protests in May and June when
workers and students demanding democracy blocked streets with buses,
sat on railroad tracks, set a train ablaze, and gathered by the tens
of thousands in the city's People's Square.
   But unlike Beijing, which has been under martial law since May
20, Shanghai's officials did not have to call in the army. What
happened in Beijing _ the army attacks and the killings _ was enough
to subdue Shanghai.
   Historically, Shanghai has been a seat of rebellion in China. The
Communist Party was formed here in 1921. The seeds of rebellion
against foreign imperialists germinated here after World War I. From
Shanghai, Mao Tse-tung launched his turbulent, ultra-leftist 1966-76
Cultural Revolution.
   Political repression is much less obvious here than in Beijing,
the national capital where police surveillance cameras are trained
on many streets and soldiers with automatic rifles stand watch at
major intersections and government buildings.
   In Shanghai, the cameras are far fewer and police at government
buildings carry only small revolvers. A truckload of green-clad
soldiers is a rare enough sight downtown that it draws stares.
   Shanghai is China's top manufacturing center and its people dress
and eat well. It's also one of the world's most densely populated
cities, with 65,000 people jammed in per square mile, in contrast to
about 23,500 per square mile in New York City.
   Markets are filled with shoppers taking time out from the workday
to haggle over fresh and salted fish, red peppers, huge scallions
and fresh noodle dough.
   At night, families sitting outside to escape the heat of their
dark, crowded apartments seem relaxed, friendly and willing to chat.
   ``Shanghai's all right,'' said a sales clerk in a dry goods
store. ``We never did get too nervous. There aren't any troops
here.''
   A young government official said, ``I'd say things are pretty
relaxed here. Shanghai people are known for business. They don't
care much for politics.''
   Still, the turmoil of May and June, which shook more than 80
Chinese cities, has had a deep impact on some aspects of life in
Shanghai.
   For example, the city has seen a sharp decline in foreign tourism
and business travelers since the unrest.
   ``Before June, I could make about 300 yuan ($81) a month,'' a
taxi driver said. ``Now I'm lucky to make 100 yuan ($27).
   ``The students don't understand that common people like me need
to improve our living standards. Life just isn't comfortable here.''
   A second-year science student at Fudan University, whose students
helped lead the protests, agreed the protests were less popular in
Shanghai than in Beijing, where hundreds of thousands of people
risked their lives to support the students.
   ``Most people were somewhere in the middle,'' he said. ``They
didn't fully support the students, but then they thought what the
government did in Beijing was too cruel.
   ``Many people, especially older people, still believe in
socialism and in the Communist Party. They don't support student
uprisings.''
   But officials in Shanghai have taken measures against some of the
protesters and their sympathizers.
   The weekly newspaper World Economic Herald, which challenged
official policies and expressed support for democracy, has been
closed while its employees, accused of anti-government activities,
undergo ``thought reform.''
   ``They're correcting their thinking,'' said a guard at the
publication's gate.
   Students in Shanghai also face political re-education that could
seriously disrupt their studies. An official report says the city
government will set up 500 ``production centers'' to give the city's
120,000 college students practical experience and ``enhance their
political consciousness.''
   Police arrested more than 150 people in midnight raids following
the protests, officials say. Ninety-nine others have been arrested
or investigated for allegedly participating in underground political
groups. Several dissident writers are reportedly under house arrest.
   The student at Fudan University looks cautiously over his
shoulder as he talks to a foreigner.
   ``Many students will get black marks in their files that will do
a lot of damage later on,'' he said.
   ``People certainly haven't forgotten about it, but it's just like
a bad dream we don't want to talk about. There's a long road ahead
of us.''

   Experts are restoring the spectacular
centuries-old castle of Al-Ukhaidir, a crumbling architectural
masterpiece and Iraq's oldest Islamic monument, as part of an
ambitious program to revive the nation's ancient glories.
   The $120-million restoration program also calls for the
conservation of other small palaces in the western desert, not far
from the Shiite Moslem shrines at Karbala and Najaf 100 miles south
of Baghdad, the capital.
   The restorations will make Iraq's early Arab heritage more
accessible to visitors and provide a contrast with the renowned
ancient sites of Ur, Babylon, Nimrud and Nineveh in the north of the
country, the conservators say.
   President Saddam Hussein is striving to bolster Iraq's image by
promoting its ancient greatness and its history of civilization that
dates back at least 6,000 years.
   During the 8-year war against Iran in the Persian Gulf, Saddam
portrayed Iraq as an Arab bulwark against Persian aggression by
recalling Assyrian and Babylonian victories over the Persians in the
first millenium B.C.
   Al-Ukhaidir characterizes that ancient glory. With its 48 towers
and thick walled fortifications still rising 65 feet above the
desert, it looms as a striking landmark visible for miles.
   The British scholar Gertrude Bell, who visited Al-Ukhaidir in
1909, called it ``a solitary magnificence which rose out of the
desert.''
   Two years later she concluded that the architecture was ``the
logical outcome of the period of cultural transition'' when Arabs
switched from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle.
   Historians and archaeologists differ on how old the castle is,
but agree it was built by an Arab emir or caliph in the century
after the Islamic conquest of Iraq in the mid-7th century A.D.
   ``Whoever built it, the castle testifies that the first Islamic
builders assimilated neighboring civilization ... an assimilation
which later expressed itself in a high order of artistic impulse,''
said Abdul Aattar Al-Azawi, head of the restoration team.
   The complex was built of rough stones hauled from surrounding
areas, with mud brick used for interior walls. It was coated with
gypsum, a soft white plaster, for protection against rain and the
sandstorms that still howl in from the desert.
   The palace filled most of the interior of the complex, featuring
a huge banquet hall, guest suites, guardrooms, a mosque and baths,
as well as two large assembly areas. The stairways on the walls were
broad enough for defenders to ride horses up to the battlements.
   The restorers, aided by a small army of Sudanese and Egyptian
laborers, are using traditional materials for the reconstructions,
including trunks of date-palms to replace missing roofs. Villagers
in the region still use that method in roofing their mud brick
houses.
   Al-Azawi said the castle was the ``first important structural
monument'' built by the Arabs after they established themselves in
areas formerly ruled by the Sassanian and Byzantine empires.
   ``No doubt the interaction and even borrowing from these
civilizations are still evident, but the Arab contribution can
easily be detected,'' he said.
   Warriors from the Arabian peninsula set out in the 7th century to
conquer the Sassanian empire.
   They occupied Iraq, but it was another century before the
Abbasids broke free from the Syrian-led Umaiyad dynasty and
transformed Iraq into Islam's most prosperous region.
   There are no inscriptions or records by which archaeologists can
establish the date the castle was founded. Oddly for such a
monumental building complex, Al-Ukhaidir isn't mentioned by early
Islamic poets or historians.
   Azawi is also working to piece together evidence suggesting the
castle stood at a crossroads of caravan routes across the desert,
linking trading centers in Iraq and Syria.
   When Gertrude Bell visited the castle she found Bedouin nomads
camped in the ruined palace.
   They were evicted in the 1930s when the first restorations were
made. But they still flock to the area for water from nearby springs
and wells and for pasture for their cattle.

   They are urban pioneers, squatters who are
inhabiting Manhattan's derelict buildings with or without legal
sanction. While many of the squatters, especially on the Lower East
side, are drug users and dealers, many are simply working people
trying to find an affordable place to live in a city where housing
costs are astounding.

<TEXT>
   In the world of New York real estate, Anne Edris
has the deal of a lifetime: a brick-walled studio apartment that
costs $50 a month.
   There are, however, two main drawbacks:
   1. She must share a bathroom with 14 other residents of the
building.
   2. The city could come by any time and tear down the building.
   Edris and her neighbors are squatters in a ramshackle structure
on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Before they moved in, it was a
vacant shell that had reverted to city ownership.
   Now, this building and dozens like it have sprung to life once
again. Much as the homesteaders populated the West, urban squatters
have inhabited some of the crumbling hollows of the nation's largest
city, legally or illegally.
   They rehabilitate the buildings, decorate their apartments, hook
up to utilities, sometimes illegally, and live communally.
   Edris is an aspiring artist who works in the photography
department of an architectural firm. ``I've always liked the idea of
reclaiming abandoned buildings and I really believe in what we're
doing here,'' she says.
   The ``rent'' Edris pays goes into a building fund used to
refurbish the building. She won the right to live in the building
only after its tenants association voted her into the building, much
as a co-op board would do. All tenants are required to perform
structural and esthetic work on the building. Any improvements she
makes on her space are up to her.
   Not everyone shares Edie's enthusiasm. Mayor Edward I. Koch and
other city officials are hostile.
   ``Our basic position is that people shouldn't live in unsafe
buildings,'' says mayoral spokesman Lee Jones. ``If a building is
demonstrably unsafe, it is incumbent on the city to remove the
threat of danger.''
   The squatters, though, defend their homes tenaciously.
   In May, when the city moved to demolish a building that had been
occupied by squatters for nearly five years, residents attacked
police guarding the demolition crew. A police car window was
smashed. A woman jumped on the back of a police supervisor and began
beating him. Police retreated.
   The growing crowd marched to a nearby condominium building. They
threw bricks and rocks through the building's window before police
broke up the demonstration and made some arrests.
   A court order temporarily blocking the demolition was overturned.
In the middle of the night, the city's Housing Preservation and
Development crew tore down the building as hundreds of police
officers in riot gear stood guard.
   If the wrecking ball arrives at Edris' building, she says.
``We've already decided that we're going to handcuff ourselves to
the fire escape rather than let them tear our house down.''
   To enter Edris' building, one must navigate a narrow hallway
cluttered with construction debris, assorted junk, lumber, painting
and cleaning supplies.
   Dust and dirt filter through holes and cracks in the building's
floors and ceiling, and climbing the stairs requires a keen eye for
loose and missing boards.
   In most apartments, much work remains to be done. But there are
signs everywhere that, modest as they are, these are people's homes.
And in five, maybe seven years, residents say, this building will be
a source of pride.
   By that time, they hope the city will allow them to legally
remain in the building or allow them to earn credit for refurbishing
the building and buy it at a bargain price. It's a wish Edris
realizes may never come true.
   Many people who squat, however, are just pleased to have a roof
over their heads; ownership of the building is not a pressing
concern.
   Some apartments in Edris' building are clean, although there are
holes in the walls and no windows. Others are filthy. They vary in
size, with ``tenants'' in the larger apartments paying $100 a month.
   Edris has removed layers of plaster to expose the brick walls of
her neatly arranged, third-floor apartment. Plastic covers the
ceiling to catch dirt from upstairs; the wooden floor is faded but
clean.
   A portable stereo is set to a jazz station as Edris shows where
she will erect a wall to divide her apartment and create a studio
work space.
   The apartment is twice the size of her old one, and comes at
one-tenth the cost. Still, she is concerned about her parents'
reaction when they come to visit from Bluffton, Ind. ``They'll
probably be shocked at first and be glad they don't live here, but
they'll still support me,'' she says.
   Next door, Rico Martinez and Noel Faulkner are installing support
beams in a large open room.
   ``Where the rats were living is where we live,'' says Martinez, a
trade school student in his 30s. ``The city tells us to go to the
homeless shelters. Hell, let them stay there. I've been there. We're
safer here. We take care of each other here.''
   Why is Faulkner working so hard on this building? ``You have to
give back. You can't just walk around saying the city stinks, crime
stinks. You have to put something in,'' says Faulkner, an actor.
   ``Or you can call it working-it-off karma,'' he says, laughing.
``It makes up for all the pot we smoked in the '60s.''

   A visitor asks if the building has running water and electricity.
   ``Yeah, but it's not legal yet,'' Edris says. ``We have running
water. We have a bathroom and a shower and we're putting in others
so that we can have a bathroom on every floor.''
   At the moment, the only bathroom is on the bottom floor and is
shared by the 15 people living in the building.
   Residents and their friends inevitably include carpenters,
electricians, plumbers and construction workers who can make water
hookups and power connections _ with or without permission from
utility firms or the city.
   A notice in one ``squat'' tells residents what jobs they must do
and reminds them to take their trash to a public garbage can on the
corner.
   At another, a bulletin board notice warns, ``Do you want to live
in the dark?'' and tells each resident to ante up or the power
company, Consolidated Edison, will shut off the electricity.
   To some, Con Ed's willingness to service an abandoned building
might be surprising. ``We're customers. We pay,'' says one squatter,
who declined to give his name. ``Everyone's entitled to have
electricity.''
   He's right. Under the state's Home Energy Fair Practices Act, Con
Ed extends service when requested and certain criteria are met, says
Martha Liipfert, a spokeswoman for the utility.
   ``If there's a meter there, we can't really turn down service as
long as there are no safety problems,'' Liipfert says.
   The company will even provide service on a communal basis,
billing the building and allowing the residents to split the cost,
Liipfert says.
   Others do not pay for power, choosing instead to hook up to a
nearby street lamp. In the often anarchic world of the squats, all
is fair.
   The Lower East Side, which has seen wave upon wave of immigrants
move in and out, is now a home to blacks, Hispanics, Eastern
Europeans, drug dealers and addicts, and a mix of punks, motorcycle
gangs, artists and other fringe elements.
   But a new influx of well-heeled residents has heightened
tensions. Residents claim the city wants to bring down old buildings
so restaurants and co-ops acceptable to yuppies can be built in
their place.
   When police tried to enforce a curfew at nearby Tompkins Square
Park last summer, a riot ensued. Residents claimed the curfew was
part of an effort to sanitize the neighborhood so it is acceptable
to the affluent.
   Buildings near Tompkins Square still bear spray-painted messages:
``Die Yuppie Scum,'' ``Need a home? Take One. Squat.'' and ``Yuppies
Go Home.''
   In July, police and park police evicted homeless people living in
Tompkins Square Park and tore down tents and lean-tos. They were
enforcing a new city law forbidding structures to be built in parks.
   Angry residents retaliated by burning police barricades; police
in riot gear arrested 31 people. Several days later, protesters
marched into the park and defiantly pitched a tent. More people were
arrested.
   The city denies it is engaged in social engineering. Vahe
Teryakian, spokesman for the city Department of Buildings, says
evictions and demolitions don't occur unless the city has received a
specific complaint and an inspection determines a building is unsafe.
   Squatters, however, say their buildings are safe, having been
inspected by friends who are architects and engineers.
   George Marco, 31, will dispute any contention that the work he
and his friends have done on their building near Tompkins Square is
substandard.
   ``We put in all new stairways, did the structural work and did
most of the plumbing in the building,'' says Marco, an electrical
worker. ``We did all the electric. Everything in the building has
been brought up to code. Nothing has been scrimped on.
   ``It was a city-owned building that had been abandoned by private
owners about 15 years ago. It sat there empty and deteriorated. We
salvaged that building and created homes.''
   Marco's fourth-floor apartment is no exemplar of good
housekeeping. It is a haphazard aggregation of unfinished plumbing
and carpentry projects.
   The pride on his face can't be suppressed, however, when he shows
his visitors the bathroom, complete with tub, shower, sink and
commode, that he installed. ``Got hot and cold water,'' he beams.
   The homeless and urban pioneers are not the only squatters. ``The
biggest squatting efforts are by the drug users, especially in the
Lower East Side,'' says Peter Smith, head of the Partnership for the
Homeless.
   But Marco defends his friends and neighbors and the hundreds of
others who are fixing walls, stringing wire, rebuilding stairways
and joining pipes at dilapidated buildings all across the Lower East
Side.
   ``Sure we've had problems with drugs, but this has been going on
all over the country, all over the place,'' Marco says. ``But to
single out people who are homesteading buildings and classifying
them as being drug addicts is totally biased and totally wrong.
   ``I want to let it be known that the people who are working and
living in this building are not junkies, they're not druggies.
They're not outcasts or anything like that.''

   Trivia, humor and momentous events are among the
lessons in American history provided by the eight presidential
museums, which drew 1.2 million visitors last year, including 9,000
researchers.

   Most visitors to the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids,
Mich., are drawn to the full-size replica of the Oval Office, but a
few feet away is an inconspicuous document for which Ford's
presidency may best be remembered.
   Unlike many other exhibits, there is no accompanying audiotape or
video, only a glass-encased document in which Ford grants Richard
Nixon a ``full, free and absolute pardon.''
   ``We get a lot of comments on that one,'' says Frank Mackaman,
director of the Ford museum and library.
   There is almost as much interest in the display of Green Bay
Packers Coach Curly Lambeau's letter offering Ford a professional
football contract following his graduation from the University of
Michigan.
   Recently donated to the museum was the gun used by Lynette
``Squeaky'' Fromm in an attempt to assassinate Ford 14 years ago.
   Nuggets about the men behind the office are part of the lesson in
American history provided by the eight presidential library-museums
run by the National Archives.
   Plenty of priceless presidential trivia is thrown in, too.
   The Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and Museum in Hyde Park, N.Y.,
displays the president's wheelchair _ a kitchen chair with the legs
cut off and wheels attached.
   At Harry S. Truman's library in Independence, Mo., there's a
cabinet with about 150 canes sent to the former president from all
over the United States.
   ``He carried a cane even though nothing was wrong with him, so
people started sending him canes,'' says archivist Ray Geselbracht.
   ``We've got a drawer with hundreds of pairs of gloves that people
sent the first lady, Bess Truman. I don't know why; I don't think
she ever wore any of them.''
   At the Herbert Hoover Library and Museum in West Branch, Iowa,
the first working television set is displayed because Hoover's image
was the first of an American president to be projected. It happened
in the mid-1920s on a broadcast from Washington to New York City.
   There's also a photograph of Hoover fishing in a stream wearing
rubber boots _ and a three-piece suit.
   ``That man was never in casual clothes,'' says curator Maureen
Harding.
   On the sites of the Hoover, Roosevelt and Truman libraries and
the Dwight D. Eisenhower Center in Abilene, Kansas, are the
presidents' burial sites and their birth or boyhood homes.
   ``Having the library in the president's hometown not only enables
people to see the president in the context of his childhood, it also
allows the town to relate to the presidency in an intellectual
environment as well as a patriotic one,'' says Jill Brett,
spokeswoman for the National Archives.
   The structures of the libraries themselves also are telling.
   ``Before I ever became associated with the library system, I was
struck by the impression that each of the facilities reflects the
personality of the incumbent,'' Mackaman says.
   ``The Ford museum is a very comfortable place to see an exhibit
and President Ford is very comfortable with himself, his place in
history,'' Mackaman says. A trip to John F. Kennedy's library, he
says, ``is a very somber experience,'' while Lyndon B. Johnson's is
``quite grandiose.''
   About 1.2 million people, many of them schoolchildren, visited
the museums in 1988, and about 9,000 researchers studied in the
libraries, each of which contains thousands of presidential papers
and photographs.
   The museums are built with private funds, but operation _ which
totaled $16.2 million in 1988 _ is federally subsidized.
   The Johnson center, on the campus of the University of Texas at
Austin, is the largest and most popular library, with more than
300,000 visitors a year, followed by the Kennedy library in Boston.
   ``There is a love-hate relationship with our politicians and our
leaders in general,'' says James Kratsas, newly appointed curator at
the Ford museum. ``People come here to see how government works, but
also, presidents represent a time in our lives.''
   Presidential museums are popular among tour groups. Some families
plan their vacations around them.
   Kratsas, former curator at the 3-year-old Jimmy Carter library in
Atlanta, says that a day after the Carter museum opened, he met a
San Diego family that had flown there for the day because it was the
only presidential museum they hadn't visited.
   Some former presidents were deeply involved in the direction of
their libraries.
   Truman, who lived less than a mile from the library following his
retirement, had an office in the building. He would sometimes
surprise schoolchildren by giving impromptu tours.
   Some classified documents are off display for national security
reasons, but presidents often help decide how to handle the
sensitive issues of their administrations.
   ``President Carter wanted to deal with the Iranian hostage crisis
in a display ... and President Ford evidently wanted to deal with
the pardon,'' Kratsas says.
   A prepared speech in the Ford museum, written before Richard
Nixon was charged with any crimes in connection with Watergate,
reads, ``I have the greatest confidence in the President, and I am
absolutely positive he had nothing to do with this mess.''
   Next to the official pardon are several critical letters _ and
just a few supportive _ of Ford's decision.
   Documents regarding his assassination are absent from the Kennedy
library, says deputy curator Frank Rigg.
   ``The library illustrates his life and the enthusiasm he
embraced,'' Rigg says. ``There's something about our museum that
takes people back into their own lives. Most people do not find it
to be a sad experience because there is an inspirational side to
it.''
   The presidential library system was inaugurated by Roosevelt.
Before his day, presidential papers, handwritten notes and
memorabilia were considered personal items and were kept either in
the Library of Congress or snatched up by university libraries or
private collectors.
   The museums chronicle the presidents' lives before and after
their administrations, and in some cases, dispel myths.
   ``President Hoover is mainly remembered as the president during
the Depression, and that's very unfortunate,'' Harding says. ``When

   Autoworker Jim Del Conte was nearing retirement
when an accident compounded by a doctor's error left him physically
and mentally handicapped. Rumors of bad medical care had circulated
for years at the plant where Del Conte worked. Now, Chrysler Corp.
is challenging the quality of care provided to dozens of its workers.

<TEXT>
   After more than three decades as an
autoworker and 20 years as a union official, Jim Del Conte was at
the pinnacle of his career.
   A simple industrial accident, a long series of medical procedures
and a doctor's error have left him with the faculties of a child and
his peers with questions about adequate medical care.
   ``I think what has happened to Jim Del Conte is horrible. I love
him like a brother and really feel for him and his family,'' says
Rudy Kuzel, a longtime friend and bargaining chairman for United
Auto Workers Local 72.
   Del Conte's case was often cited by workers and union officials
this summer after Chrysler Corp. announced it was challenging the
quality of medical care provided dozens of injured workers at its
now-closed Kenosha assembly plant.
   Chrysler is refusing to pay some 200 workers' compensation claims
and is reviewing an additional 300 medical bills. The automaker says
it made the decision after an outside consultant determined the care
provided to many former Kenosha workers was ``inappropriate,
unreasonable and excessive.''
   Del Conte's case is not believed among the claims being
challenged.
   Because Chrysler has stated it will not hold the workers liable
for the bills and will provide them with legal assistance, union
officials have given the challenge a favorable response.
   ``I wish this would have happened five years ago because maybe
all that wouldn't have happened to Jimmy,'' Kuzel says.
   Kuzel says rumors of bad medical treatment have circulated among
workers for more than a decade and he hopes Chrysler's challenge
``will give everybody their day in court.''
   Del Conte, 58, was an executive board member of UAW Local 72 for
20 years. His hard work and friendly demeanor won him widespread
popularity among the city's blue- and white-collar ranks.
   His wife, Rose Marie, says her husband looked forward to retiring
to spend more time with her, his five children and eight
grandchildren.
   Instead, he spends most of his time sitting at home, dependent on
his family for care. His speech is broken, his brain is damaged and
his body is partially paralyzed from the waist up.
   ``Dad is more like a 5-year-old sometimes than a grandfather,''
says Michelle Scuglik, Del Conte's 37-year-old daughter, who
remembers her father as active, strong and consumed with work.
   Del Conte's troubles began in February 1983 when he slipped and
fell on ice while working at the Kenosha plant, then owned by
American Motors Corp. The plant was sold in 1986-87 to Chrysler and
closed last December, laying off about 5,000 workers.
   Del Conte developed low-back pain and was hospitalized twice for
a total of about two weeks immediately after the accident.
   According to legal documents and court testimony, Del Conte was
referred to Dr. Galo Tan, who has offices in Gurnee, Ill., and is on
staff at American International Hospital in Zion, Ill.
   Under Tan's care, he was hospitalized several times in 1986 and
1987. In February 1986 Tan performed a cervical laminectomy in which
bone spurs believed to be pinching nerves and causing pain were
removed from a vertebra in Del Conte's neck.
   The pain continued. Del Conte was hospitalized several more
times, exposed to nearly 100 X-rays, and given a variety of
treatments, including a series of nerve blocks in which medicine was
injected to temporarily stop the pain.
   In December 1987, about a year after he retired, Del Conte
entered American Hospital for the last time, complaining _ as he had
in the past _ of back and neck pain and headaches.
   Tan wrote orders for Dr. Celan T. Ordonez, an anesthesiologist at
American, to perform another nerve block, this time in the upper
spine near where the laminectomy had been performed.
   Ordonez performed the nerve block Dec. 15, 1987, using, among
other drugs, Marcaine, a strong, long-lasting anesthetic.
   Within minutes Del Conte went into cardiac arrest and then a
coma. He was revived but remained in a coma or semicomatose state
through February 1988.
   Del Conte was moved from American to Froedtert Memorial Hospital
in Wauwatosa after the mishap. For more than three months his family
traveled 40 miles from Kenosha each day to be with him.
   Del Conte was later transferred to Sacred Heart Rehabilitation
Hospital in Milwaukee for therapy and then released to the care of
his family. He undergoes therapy twice a week.
   Del Conte's lawyer, James A. Pitts of Racine, says his client has
only partial use of his arms, has difficulty speaking clearly and
has an IQ of about 80 because of brain damage.
   Pitts filed a lawsuit against Tan and Ordonez on behalf of the
Del Contes.
   Ordonez' insurance carrier settled before the trial for $920,000.
Of that, $75,000 went to reimburse the Del Contes' insurance carrier
for medical bills.
   A U.S. District Court jury in Illinois acquitted Tan of any
wrongdoing in connection with the coma. Pitts had argued Tan should
be held responsible because he ordered the treatment that led to the
mishap.
   But defense witnesses testified that the procedure could be
performed safely in the right hands and that only Ordonez could be
held responsible.
   Pitts says the Del Contes' lawsuit only challenged the procedure
that led to the coma and did not raise the question of whether Del
Conte's overall care was excessive.
   ``That was not the issue. But it would have been nice if that
stuff came in. ... That may be a separate issue of whether there was
overtreatment here,'' Pitts says.
   While the issue of overtreatment was not a factor in the civil
trial, it was alluded to in documents accompanying the lawsuit. Many
referred to the countless X-rays and hospitalizations Del Conte
endured.
   Dr. David S. Dahl, chairman of neurology at the University of
Wisconsin Medical School, criticized the ``low level of record
documentation and general competency regarding the case'' and the
``over-reliance on epidural injections for treatment.''
   While Chrysler challenges the medical care other workers
received, the Del Contes will be able to live comfortably because of
a pension, social security disability checks and the settlement,
Pitts says.
   ``But you can't put a value on what the guy has lost,'' he adds.
``His mind is like one of the grandchildren. Someone has to be with
him all the time. His family has to take care of him.''

   French author Rene Dumont has spent more than
half a century warning of environmental ills and preaching the
importance of education, population control and fair trade. In
France, his name evokes sly smiles. But his colleagues abroad now
consider him a prophet.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Rene Dumont, who's been grumbling ``I told you
so'' for 50 years, new focus on global environment comes not a
moment too soon.
   ``If we don't do something fast, we're finished. It is as simple
as that,'' says Dumont, whose 32 books make that point in chilling
detail.
   A French agronomist turned agitator-advocate for the planet at
large, Dumont still evokes sly smiles among countrymen used to his
white hair, red sweater and green politics.
   At 85, Dumont spends more time in France before small provincial
audiences than television cameras. But abroad, his colleagues now
see him as a prophet whose cries in the wilderness should have been
heard.
   ``The prophetic nature of his vision is spectacular,'' wrote
Lloyd Timberlake, an American environmentalist, in a preface to a
fresh edition of Dumont's classic ``False Start in Africa.''
   Dumont, Timberlake added, remains ``an eccentric, a gadfly, an
agent provocateur in the very best sense of the word.''
   Dumont trots the globe collecting honorary doctorates and
speaking. He scrambles for early flights on hectic schedules. But he
never misses his nap, even if it means stretching out in a crowded
room.
   He is cheered on, now that environmental issues are finally
reaching summit conference agendas. ``It's coming,'' he says,
eyebrows bristling like mystic antennae. ``It's coming.''
   At a recent panel in Spain, Timberlake picked up a main theme
Dumont has hammered away at for decades: Careless, needless emission
of gases threatens catastrophic weather changes.
   ``Look at Africa,'' said Dumont, his words rising to a crescendo.
``First we stole their labor, then we stole their primary products,
and now we are stealing their weather.''
   In a not-too-distant future, he warned, everyone else is next.
   Dumont clutched his notes and flailed at unseen culprits with
them. His eyes, twinkling at irony and burning at punch lines,
suggested he might leap up and convert words to action.
   In the small apartment at the edge of Paris where he once thought
he'd retire, he expands on the point more calmly.
   ``Everyone blames aerosol sprays, but the problem is automobiles,
carbon dioxide emissions,'' he says. ``We keep on as if there is
nothing wrong, no danger, no urgency. What madness.''
   With new evidence, he stresses constant themes: Education, the
status of women, population control, fair trade and development are
as vital to saving the world as scientific remedies.
   Poverty, desperation and ignorance cause ecological plunder, he
says, but greed and extravagance cause much more.
   ``We waste half the energy we produce,'' he says. ``And we are
killing ourselves. It is suicide.''
   The difference between Dumont and most others who deliver that
message is that he's watched it happen up close, since his father
taught him about agriculture in post-World War I France.
   ``I studied agriculture because you have to understand the world
to change it,'' he says. ``Rather than focusing on a neighborhood in
France, I looked at the whole world. But it is the same thing.''
   As a colonial officer in Indochina in 1934, he wrote a book about
rice that also told how officials destroyed 500,000 tons of rice to
bolster the price of French wheat.
   That set a life-long pattern. Mingling hard truths about official
incompetence with scientific wisdom, Dumont left both devoted
followers and bitter enemies in his wake.
   He repeatedly sacrificed comfortable government posts for the
right to speak out. In the early 1960s, as most of Africa broke into
small independent nations, Dumont took a customary hard look.
   He saw European economists encouraging Africans to produce export
crops at cheap prices, laying waste to fragile lands while
neglecting farmers they depended upon for food.
   He noticed young African men swelling inept bureaucracies while
women, left unschooled in the fields, accounted for the only
production.
   ``If your sister goes to school,'' Dumont told one young African
clerk, ``you'll have nothing to eat but your fountain pen.''
   It took economists 25 years to focus on these basic crises,
despite three more Dumont books on the subject.
   Dumont was so close to the mark that President Julius Nyerere of
Tanzania and Kenneth Kuanda of Zambia took his ideas as their own,
although neither put them into practice.
   In Latin America, Dumont warned of disappearing rain forests,
rising debt and the economic dominance of coca crops well before
environmentalists sounded the alarm.
   In Asia, he presaged the Green Revolution.
   Today, he remains one step ahead. The World Resources Institute
in Washington suggested that natural resources be included in
measuring a nation's economic worth. Vintage Dumont.
   A growing number of economists and environmentalists argue that
gasoline should be heavily taxed to discourage waste and generate
research funds. Dumont pressed for that well before the oil crisis.
   As agronomists finally consider the specter of mass hunger, they
reach for a book Dumont wrote in 1966: ``We Are Headed For Famine.''
   In the 1970s, he edged into politics. He ran for president in
1974 and won 1.3 percent of the vote. He holds non-specific leftist
views that put the Earth first. His latest book, ``An Intolerable
World,'' picks apart free-market dogma.
   His forthright striding through French politics has caused some
to lose sight of his scientific expertise and his track record.
   ``Some people say I weaken my credibility by being political,''
he says. ``They don't understand. The environment is politics.''
   Asked why his spirits had not flagged, reiterating the obvious to
the uninterested for so many years, Dumont shakes his head in sharp
disagreement and recounts the previous week's schedule.
   ``If you reach anyone at all, you are making an impact,'' he
says. ``I need everyone to save the planet.''
   When not lecturing or writing, Dumont is out learning something.
   At the Spain panel, he skipped lunch and reappeared later,
coddling a bouquet of wildflowers carefully uprooted for study.
   His professor's salary, royalties and assorted earnings might
allow him to take it easy amid the nature he has defended all his
life.
   ``I tried four months of retirement,'' he says. ``It was four
months of nervous depression.''
   His apartment is spare but for walls of books and a few doodads
such as a fifth century Chinese buffalo and some priceless Tang
horses.
   When an interviewer comes to lunch, he sweeps his
works-in-progress off the small antique table he uses as a desk; it
doubles as the dining table.
   ``We don't believe in having a separate room only for eating,''
Dumont says. ``Such a waste.''

   Stehekin is a remote community in Washington's
Cascade Range reachable only by floatplane, boat or wilderness
trail. It's a year-round home to 70 people who live a life free of
telephones, supermarkets and other modern conveniences. However,
life in Stehekin is not free of controversy.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>STEHEKIN, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deer grazes on the lawn of the new,
one-room schoolhouse. Nearby, a salesman for a nationally
distributed newspaper pitches a vending machine to operators of the
only hotel.
   It's hard to imagine a more remote corner of the continental
United States than this community of 70 people occupying a narrow
valley in the majestic Cascade Range. There are no phones and no
doctors, and Stehekin can't be reached by car. Nonetheless, people
manage to find it.
   Some come by floatplane. Others take a four-hour boat ride up
Lake Chelan, starting 55 miles south in the resort town of Chelan.
There is a third option: a mountain hike on a wilderness trail
shared by black bears.
   The remoteness of Stehekin _ and the adventure of reaching it _
have made the town a popular tourist attraction in summer, drawing
over 40,000 visitors from ``down lake.'' At the same time,
competition for those limited tourist dollars has created a
Capra-esque struggle between private citizens and the National Park
Service that controls the community, since Stehekin is in the Lake
Chelan National Recreation Area adjacent to North Cascades National
Park.
   Stehekin's location _ within the recreation area rather than the
park _ is important. It means that the 600 acres of private land it
contained when it received national recreation area status in 1968
are allowed to remain in private hands.
   Still, because of that NRA designation, what might be an obscure
civic dispute in another setting is elevated to high drama in
Stehekin, where the right to sell cinnamon rolls, rent mountain
bikes or operate a tour bus can determine whether a family is
banished from the community by economic need.
   ``It's hard to make a living up here,'' says Roberta Courtney, a
longtime resident who just opened a bakery. ``You've got to find
employment and make enough in the summer to live through the
winter.''
   Since Stehekin has no farming, no logging and no industry, that
means tourism.
   But even that isn't easy. The National Park Service has a
monopoly on serving tourists, and awards each contract to a lone
company. Those contracts require that the concessionaires have a
reasonable chance of making a profit.
   ``This is supposed to be a monopoly,'' says Steve Gibson, a
Chelan resident under contract until 1992 to operate Stehekin's
25-room North Cascades Lodge, as well as a small grocery,
restaurant, gas station, boat rentals, tour bus and bike rentals.
   The businesses are concentrated at the Stehekin boat landing,
where the daily arrival of the Lady of the Lake with hundreds of
tourists provides the major activity. Many tourists stay just the
hour and a half before the boat returns to Chelan.
   ``My contract grants security for my investment,'' says Gibson,
who contends he faces heavy expenses for liability insurance and
winter services that the government demands even when there aren't
any tourists.
   The system doesn't sit well with Mrs. Courtney, 27. After
launching her bakery two miles from the landing, she was prohibited
from selling goods to tourists from a cart. ``Is that free
enterprise?'' she asks.
   Also angry are Ron Scutt, the lone schoolteacher, and wife Kim,
who rent mountain bikes in defiance of the Park Service. They have
been stopped from operating a competing tour bus business, however.
   The Scutts contend the current concessionaire is not willing to
share the wealth with local residents. ``More cooperation would
help,'' Scutt says.
   Gibson argues that the private entrepreneurs are free to operate
only during the high tourist season and to set their own prices,
enabling them to provide cheaper services. That results in unfair
competition, he contends.
   In one form or another, the conflict has been going on for
decades.
   There is another side to life in Stehekin: the magical beauty of
a mountain valley surrounding a lake situated amid snowcapped peaks
and evergreens.
   ``The first time we came here we never wanted to leave,'' says
Mrs. Scutt, 39. The Scutts' two children are among the 10 students
enrolled in the new school. Like all buildings in Stehekin, it's
heated with firewood. In winter, students ski to class.

   In summer, Stehekin takes on the air of a busy campground.
   The landing area for the 350-passenger Lady of the Lake is
downright congested as people stream off the boat. Some speak German
or Dutch, and many are accompanied by young children.
   They're greeted by Park Service rangers in crisp uniforms, or
local residents in walking shorts, polo shirts and fashionable
sunglasses.
   Popular activities include hiking, biking, airplane tours and
horseback rides. The lodge has a hot tub. There are evening lectures
at the information center on subjects ranging from acid rain to
wildlife myths.
   Electrical service is provided by a small hydroelectric plant.
And the Park Service does have a radio-telephone should emergencies
arise.
   Still, when the last tourist departs in mid-October, it's hard to
view Stehekin as a trendy vacation spot. Four feet of snow falls in
winter and the major lifeline to the outside world becomes a monthly
supply barge.
   ``A lot of time is devoted to living,'' says Philip Campbell,
district manager for the Park Service who oversees the 10 full-time
rangers in Stehekin. ``You move snow and keep the fireplace going.''
   Residents read, socialize, ski and swap videocassettes, he says.
A few have satellite dishes, but most do without broadcast
television.
   Campbell came to Stehekin _ Indian for ``the way through'' _ from
Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in New Jersey, an area
with 2 million annual visitors. ``I wanted to do this once in my
career,'' he says. ``This is probably the largest intact piece of
wilderness in the lower 48.''
   The Scutts, raised near Philadelphia, are typical Stehekin
residents. They were dormitory supervisors at Washington State
University in Pullman when Scutt decided to return to teaching,
choosing to do so in a one-room schoolhouse.
   The Scutts have been here 13 years and don't want to leave. But
they may be forced to because their oldest son will soon graduate
from the eighth grade, and must leave town to attend high school.
   Like other Stehekin parents, the Scutts must decide whether to
send 13-year-old Huuti to another town alone, split the family with
one parent moving with him, or move the entire family.
   ``We spend a great deal of time over coffee talking about it,''
says Scutt, who's considering sending Huuti to a Quaker school near
Philadelphia.
   Despite its remoteness, Stehekin has a surprisingly diverse
population. One of the 25 Park Service volunteer rangers this summer
is Judy Abrams, 21, a student at Harvard University who hails from
Atlanta.
   Taking tourists on a nature walk along forest trials, Miss Abrams
points out edible berries and bear tracks, and identifies trees and
plants.
   When not leading tour groups, she digs irrigation ditches at
Stehekin's only apple orchard, where fruit is picked and eaten by
residents, tourists and the occasional bear. She works for lodging
and $35 per week.
   ``I've got to go back to the big city (at summer's end),'' she
says. ``Can you imagine what a change it's going to be?''
   Mark Stewart, a year-round resident with three children, spends
two weeks each month working on a tugboat on Puget Sound, and the
other two weeks living in Stehekin. ``I like the isolation,'' says
Stewart, who used to live in a Seattle suburb. ``We're out of the
mainstream.''
   The remoteness of Stehekin can be a mixed blessing. While the
Park Service can provide some first aid, the closest doctors are in
Chelan, and it can take well over an hour to transport an injured
person by float plane. At night, the only way to get downlake is by
boat. For that reason, pregnant women leave Stehekin at least two
weeks before their delivery dates.
   ``This is not the place to get hurt,'' says Campbell, who warns
tourists about the lack of medical facilities.
   After raising two sons in Stehekin, Scutt says the key is just
having faith that misfortune will not occur. ``You can't live here
if you are constantly afraid of what is going to happen to your
children.''
   It also helps in Stehekin to be an organized shopper.
   Residents mail grocery lists, along with blank, signed checks, to
a grocery store in Chelan. The store fills the order and places it
on the Lady of the Lake for delivery.

   Researchers at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon
University are making beautiful music the new-fashioned way, with
computers and sophisticated synthesizers. One of their creations is
a computer that teaches beginners how to play the piano, scolding
them when they make mistakes.

   Practice makes perfect in piano playing,
especially when the tutor is a computer.
   A new computer tutor keeps beginning pianists in line by
selecting appropriate lessons, then monitoring the students' efforts
on an electronic keyboard.
   Piano Tutor, as it's called, is just one example of how
music-minded researchers are tapping technology and pushing beyond
the boundaries of the familiar Moog synthesizer of the 1960s and
1970s.
   ``What we're doing is learning how to control the technology that
is part of our culture, and that's not just for the sake of using
technology,'' says Craig Harris, president of the Computer Music
Association.
   ``We need to re-evaluate how we learn, how we think about sound,
how we think about music and art.''
   Piano Tutor accomplishes that as an instructional tool, missing
nary note nor beat.
   ``There was something extra between these notes. Try again,'' the
computer flashes on a screen after a less-than-perfect performance
by a student.
   Or:
   ``You waited too long before playing this note.''
   ``You played this note too soon. Be sure to give the preceding
rest its full value.''
   ``Your rhythm was very uneven. Try keeping a steady beat.''
   During downright awful renditions, the computer interrupts and
instructs students to begin again _ and again and again, if
necessary.
   ``We're trying to model this after real teachers, and a real
teacher would interrupt right at the beginning,'' says Roger
Dannenberg, a research computer scientist at Pittsburgh's Carnegie
Mellon University.
   His collaborators, Annabelle Joseph and Marta Sanchez, music
professors at Carnegie Mellon, have interrupted countless piano
students over the years for mistakes mysteriously materializing in
practice.
   The three entered exercises and tunes such as ``Yankee Doodle
Dandy'' into the computer by describing how the music appears on the
written page and by performing the selections on an attached
electronic keyboard.
   ``Always as piano teachers, you're concerned about what happens
with a student between lessons,'' Ms. Joseph says. ``No matter how
carefully you explain things, strange things happen in the week
between, so you spend a lot of time correcting.''
   Another Carnegie Mellon researcher, Paul McAvinney, has invented
VideoHarp, a computerized instrument capable of sensing gestures to
reproduce the sound of any instrument, including an entire orchestra.
   Images of a performer's fingers are reflected by mirrors into an
optical sensor McAvinney designed. From this pattern of light and
shadow, the position and velocity of each fingertip are deduced. The
information subsequently is translated by computer and transmitted
to synthesizers that produce the sound.
   The kind of sound emanating from amplifiers _ string, woodwind,
percussion, brass _ is determined by programs stored in the computer.
   ``It is neat that an absolute musical idiot like myself can make
a good sound by just having enough flexibility,'' says McAvinney, a
senior research programmer at Carnegie Mellon and chairman of Sensor
Frame Corp.
   While speaking, McAvinney haphazardly brushes his hands across
both sides of the 13-pound, trapezoid-shaped instrument, just as a
harpist might. A stream of deep, lush notes never before heard _ and
likely never to be heard again _ fills the small music laboratory.
   ``A lot of people ask me if I'm a musician. I tell them no, but I
don't believe Stradivari was either,'' he says.
   Each finger is capable of reproducing a particular instrument's
sound, successively or simultaneously. Four fingers consequently can
sound like a string quartet, with practice, of course.
   ``You certainly can't play each of those instruments the way that
a person in the orchestra plays each instrument,'' McAvinney says.
``No human is capable of that. But if anybody ever wants to try,
there it is.''
   Until five or so years ago, so-called computer music was
impractical for live performances since it took longer to compute
the sound than the sound actually lasted, says Stephen Pope, editor
of the Computer Music Journal.
   That changed in the early 1980s with the advent of digital
synthesizers, which enabled instruments to sound like something else
_ anything else, in fact _ while played the usual way.
   VideoHarp goes a step further by incorporating totally new ways
of playing. Brushing one's toes against the instrument, for example,
can generate sounds the same as using one's fingers.
   While other researchers around the world are trying to
communicate with computers on an artistic level, the Carnegie Mellon
projects are ``really good, major examples of it,'' Harris says.
   ``How do you get a machine to be expressive? A lot of people have
complained about that,'' he says. ``Even the piano is a machine. But
the leap from the piano to a device like VideoHarp is a rather large
leap, especially when it involves creating many sounds that are new
to our hearing.''
   Piano Tutor is significant, Harris says, in that it moves beyond
routine instruction.
   ``There are many programs out there for doing exactly what we did
in 1950, but now doing it in computers _ treating learning as if it
were a notebook, a classroom, going page by page by page and not
really paying attention to what that particular person needs right
now,'' he says.
   In addition to tracking pupils' efforts, Piano Tutor features a
built-in metronome and provides accompaniment on request. Students
also can watch a pre-recorded videodisc of piano teachers in action
to see how their own hands and posture should look.
   Piano Tutor is still evolving, according to Dannenberg, and
should be commercially available in three years.
   Some people, most notably musicians, worry that computers
eventually may replace instrumentalists. Even if those concerns
prove true, Harris believes there will be more, not fewer, jobs.
   ``It's not that we're taking six people's work and turning it
into one who's using a synthesizer,'' he says. ``That's a real myth
because we're creating many new fields and we're creating new uses
of instruments and we're creating a huge need for teachers who
understand where it's going.''
   While admittedly unconventional, ``there is nothing radically new
or weird'' about computer music, according to Pope.
   ``It's just composers using the state-of-the-art technology of
our time, which happens to be software and computers,'' he said.
``It's no less musical if a composer is involved in technology.''

   Except for more action, this fall's television
schedule looks a lot like last year's.
   The three networks, which have been steadily losing viewers to
cable, pay channels, independent stations, videocassettes and Fox
Broadcasting Co., aren't making many changes. NBC, after winning the
prime-time ratings race four years in a row, is doing the least
tinkering with its lineup.
   Comedy is still king, but action drama is coming back. Fast cars,
fast boats, fast horses are big again.
   There are two Western series this fall, CBS' returning
``Paradise'' and ABC's new show, ``The Young Riders.''
   Male teams, male bonding, male cops are back.
   Reality programming is also making a strong comeback. CBS has two
magazine shows, ``60 Minutes'' and ``Saturday Night With Connie
Chung,'' plus ``48 Hours'' and ``Rescue: 911.'' ABC has two magazine
shows, ``20-20'' and ``PrimeTime Live.'' NBC has ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' but its only attempt at a magazine show will be an
occasional telecast of ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow.''
   Here's a look at the new series.
   MONDAY:
   ``Major Dad'' _ Gerald McRaney is a gruff, tough Marine major who
suddenly finds himself surrounded by females when he marries a
``fire-eating liberal'' female reporter with three young daughters
in this comedy. McRaney stays calm as he handles crises at the
Marine base and at home. Shanna Reed is his wife. CBS, 8-8:30 p.m.
EDT.
   ``The People Next Door'' _ Jeffrey Jones is a successful
cartoonist with two kids, a new wife (Mary Gross) and a vivid
imagination that springs to life. Life is tough enough, but he also
has to deal with his fantasies face to face. His new wife is a
psychologist and his kids are embarrassed by confrontations with his
imaginary life. CBS, 8:30-9 p.m. EDT.
   ``The Famous Teddy Z'' _ Jon Cryer is the only kid in the
mailroom at Unlimited Talent Agency; his grandmother wants him to
work in the family bakery. By a fluke, he becomes a big-time
Hollywood agent to the astonishment _ or envy _ of everyone. Alex
Rocco is the oily head of the agency, Erica Yohn is his grandmother.
Creator Hugh Wilson calls it his ``revenge'' on Hollywood. CBS,
9:30-10 p.m. EDT.
   ``Alien Nation'' _ Gary Graham is an earthling police detective
and Eric Pierpoint is his space alien partner in this detective
drama based on the motion picture. It's set in Los Angeles in the
1990s with the added element of a colony of ``newcomers'' whose
spaceship has crash-landed. The aliens are humanoids with large
heads and no ears. Fox, 9-10 p.m. EDT.
   TUESDAY:
   ``Rescue: 911'' _ William Shatner is host of this reality-based
series about police, paramedics, firefighters and other emergency
specialists. It is filmed on the scene across the United States.
CBS, 8-9 p.m. EDT.

disgrace, returns as a loner detective along the waterfront. He is
also trying to patch relations with his fisherman father, Joseph
Sirola. Also stars Nicholas Surovy, Judith Hoag, J.C. Brandy and
Mimi Kuzyk. CBS, 9-10 p.m. EDT.
   ``Chicken Soup'' _ Comedian Jackie Mason is a retired pajamas
salesman who starts a new career helping young people in a community
center. His Irish rose is Lynn Redgrave, a widow with three
children. This is touted as the biggest hit of the season due to its
positioning after ``Roseanne.'' ABC, 9:30 p.m. EDT.
   ``Island Son'' _ Richard Chamberlain is back with a new series
and he's still practicing medicine. This time he's in Hawaii,
fighting for his patients and combating hospital bureaucracy. CBS,
10-11 p.m. EDT.
   WEDNESDAY:
   ``A Peaceable Kingdom'' _ Lindsay Wagner is the director of a
big-city zoo and Tom Wopat is the curator in this family drama.
Wagner's three children live at the zoo but don't always appreciate
having koalas and rhinos next door. CBS, 8 p.m. EDT.
   ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' _ Doogie, played by Neil Patrick Harris,
is a hospital resident. He's also only 16 years old. Doogie can take
out your gall bladder, but he's just learning to drive. He worries
about girls. It also stars James B. Sikking and Belinda Montgomery
as his parents. It's the first show in Steven Bochco's multiseries
contract with ABC. ABC, 9:30-10 p.m. EDT.
   ``Nutt House'' _ Check into this hotel creation by Mel Brooks and
Alan Spencer (``Sledge Hammer''). Ask for the rubber room. Cloris
Leachman is the overbearing head of housekeeping. Harvey Korman is
the fussy manager. NBC, 9:30-10 p.m. EDT.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan Contra rebels based here are
bitter because the United States has agreed they should disband, but
some say they won't give up and will return to the Nicaraguan
jungles.
   ``The United States abandoned us when we needed them,'' said a
Contra fighter who uses the battle name ``Jonas'' because the
Biblical Jonas was delivered safely from the belly of the whale.
   In contrast, most said, the Hondurans had been good allies,
allowing the Contras free run of a large swath of territory in
eastern Honduras.
   ``We get along great with the Contras. They are good people,''
said a Honduran soldier assigned to a small detachment based in
Yamales.
   The United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars
helping the Contras, but the end is in sight following a Central
American agreement to disband the Contra army seeking to topple
Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   The United States is still providing non-lethal aid, but several
Contra commanders complained that even before this U.S. aid had been
uncertain, that conditions on the aid had limited the Contras'
ability to fight a guerrilla war and had, in addition, made a
peasant insurgent movement appear to be nothing more than a U.S.
tool.
   ``We never knew what position the United States was going to
take,'' said Israel Galeano, Contra chief of staff.
   He is one of a group of young and battle-hardened commanders who
have taken control of the fighting forces from what they call the
``desk warriors'' of the Nicaraguan Directorate.
   ``The desk commanders got too far away from the fighters,'' said
``Commander Dimas,'' head of operations for the Contra general staff.
   Officials at the Contras' offices in Miami said they could no
longer grant permission for journalists to visit Yamales, for
instance, because Galeano controls access to the base.
   The young commanders say they know the Contras cannot survive as
a fighting force in Honduras following the disbanding agreement Aug.
7, so, despite a shortage of supplies, they are planning to lead
their men back into the jungle to await Nicaragua elections set for
February.
   U.S. officials and sources in the directorate say they fear the
returning soldiers will simply be wiped out by a vastly superior
Sandinista force. But field commanders say they are confident they
can survive, and many fighters said that when they took up arms
years ago they never thought of U.S. aid.
   The 29-year-old Galeano said his men won't attack Sandinista
forces but will defend themselves. He added that his strategy is to
keep his force operative as a means of pressuring the Sandinistas to
hold fair elections.
   ``We've been exploited. We've got to show the world we aren't
mercenaries of Reagan and Bush,'' said a battalion commander known
as ``Commander Nolan.'' He, like others, said the Contras were
created by conditions inside Nicaragua and that the war would not
end until those conditions change.
   The United States provided military aid during the Reagan
administration, but that was cut off in February 1988.
   On Aug. 7, presidents of the Central American countries agreed to
disband the Contras by Dec. 8 in exchange for democratization in
Nicaragua. But most fighters interviewed recently saw the agreement
as leaving them with options that range from bad to worse.
   Few believe the promise of President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua
that it is safe for them to return peacefully, and many see death
awaiting them in the Nicaraguan jungle.
   ``It's immoral to send all these people to their deaths,'' said
Nolan, who is planning to lead his own battalion, even though he
lost a lung in battle.
   Galeano was the only commander who expressed any sympathy for the
U.S. position, where the Reagan administration was unable to impose
its will on a Democrat-controlled Congress.
   ``We understand the problems of a democracy that needs consensus
to act,'' Galeano said in an interview. ``It's what we want for our
own people.''
   The Aug. 7 agreement effectively took the Contra issue out of the
Honduran presidential-election campaign, where a vote is set for
Nov. 26, two weeks before the deadline for disbanding the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   ``To Honduras, we'll say thank you and good-bye,'' said Dimas.
``Effectively, they've been allies.''
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo, who cannot run for re-election, said
that if the Contras move out of Honduras as an armed force their
fate will be an ``an internal matter'' for Nicaragua and none of
Honduras' business.
   Even so, Honduras has reinforced a battalion of the 110th
Infantry Brigade that patrols the isolated hills and blocks the
access road to the camps.
   Many Hondurans have been upset by rumors that groups of Contras
would become bandits, but a Honduran soldier said, ``We can't stop
them from getting out individually.''
   The Contra fighters worry about their families as well as about
3,000 guerrillas who suffered crippling wounds.
   ``We're going to ask the United States to take care of them,''
Dimas said. ``That's the least they can do.''
   The United States is providing medical aid and rehabilitation,
and Contra leaders say they have been told refugees and the wounded
will be taken care of even after aid to the fighters runs out.
   The fighters' families mostly live in nearby villages, refugee
camps and the small city of Danli, 80 miles to the west.
   People there are very discouraged, said Enrique Rizo Lopez, a
resettlement group spokesman. ``A lot of them want to go to the
States.''
   U.S. officials point to a new aspect of the aid program: efforts
to teach literacy, civics, and skills like barbering, cooking and
even oratory to the fighters, most of them poorly educated peasants.
   ``I want to show them they still have supporters, they will not
be left alone,'' said a U.S. aide, a Nicaraguan-American
schoolteacher from Hialeah, Fla., who gave his name only as Julian.
   But a doctor who uses the name ``Ulysses'' said a U.S.-supported
hospital has been forced to suspend all but emergency services to
both Contras and local civilians. As he spoke, he tried to light a
cigarette.
   ``It's like U.S. aid,'' he said, flicking a balky lighter. ``It
works when it wants to.''

   Death has run hard after Ieshia Williams
from the moment she was born, nearly catching her on her eighth
birthday a year ago when pneumonia attacked an immune system
weakened by the AIDS virus.
   Tyesha Williams, born the same September day in 1980 in the same
hospital, knows death one step removed. Never infected and now
taller, stronger and quicker in school than Ieshia, she cannot shake
her worry: ``Is my sister going to the hospital today?''
   They're identical twins _ and yet they could hardly be more
different.
   ``I'' and ``Ty,'' as they are called, do not share AIDS but they
share its anguish. And though they differ in growth, they are close
in spirit.
   Clapping together, they chant the sing-song of a favorite game:
   ``Mama got the measles,
   ``Papa got the flu.
   ``I ain't lyin',
   ``Neither are you.''
   Doris Williams watches. A 51-year-old widow, she adopted the
twins when their mother, barely 21, poor and jobless, gave them up.
   But as Mrs. Williams cares for the girls who share identical
genes, no one can tell her for certain why their lives have taken
such divergent paths.
   ``Ieshia had the bad luck, Tyesha had the good luck,'' says Dr.
James Oleske, medical director of the AIDS program at Children's
Hospital in Newark, N.J.
   ``What is amazing is that they shared bottles and the whole bit
since birth,'' says their pediatrician, Dr. Karl E. Russell-Brown.
   Ieshia and Tyesha are among 12 sets of twins in this country
known to have been exposed to AIDS, according to Oleske. In four
cases, only one twin was infected with the virus.
   ``It's rare,'' says Oleske. ``You usually expect both and that's
usually what happens.''
   A tainted blood transfusion may be to blame for Ieshia's illness,
or it may have been an infinitesimal difference in the blood supply
to the placenta, allowing the virus to reach her and not Tyesha
before birth. The mother has refused to be tested for exposure to
the virus.
   Ieshia has survived twice as long as do most children with AIDS.
``She has got to be God's kid,'' says Mrs. Williams, a former nurse.
   Ieshia was among the first diagnosed child AIDS victims in the
United States. She was the trendsetter in getting some New Jersey
schools to accept children with the virus.
   Her survival is a bright spot amid the bleakness for families and
doctors who have watched more than 700 children die of AIDS.
   ``Children with AIDS have more severe recurrent bacterial
infections,'' says Oleske. ``The disease progresses much more
quickly so that children will frequently die much faster than the
adults.''
   Oleske diagnosed Ieshia when she was 2 years old in the early
1980s when immunologists like himself first started seeing cases of
what turned out to be pediatric AIDS. ``We didn't even know what to
call it then,'' recalls Oleske.
   Today, with the increased knowledge of AIDS, a child like Ieshia
would probably be diagnosed at six months.
   AIDS has delayed Ieshia's development to the point where she is
in a class for neurologically impaired children, two years behind
Tyesha. Oleske doesn't think she'll ever catch up to her sister.
   But AIDS has not dampened Ieshia's spirit, even though it has
stunted her growth. She is only 3 feet 8 inches tall, nearly a foot
shorter than her sister who is in fourth grade.
   Ieshia is a charming child with ponytails and a smile showing
silver-capped teeth _ the latter a legacy of the decay brought on by
AIDS-induced complications. And yet she's ornery, feisty and tough.
   When other children taunt her in school _ after Mrs. Williams
obtained a court order to get her in _ she hurls the taunts right
back.
   Her toughness masks her longing for kinder attention.
   ``I made up a father for Ieshia,'' says Mrs. Williams. ``When she
kept asking for this father, I gave her George, who was her mother's
brother-in-law. ... I think she knows better but she just wants to
have a father.''
   While Tyesha jumps rope double dutch and goes to Girl Scouts'
summer day camp, Ieshia can only dream of such fun. ``She's too
small,'' Tyesha explains.
   Instead Ieshia goes to the park with her little cousins and plays
on the slides, swings and monkey bars. Her cousins play tennis, but
not Ieshia.
   ``She doesn't play tennis 'cause she's not allowed to stay in the
sun too long,'' says cousin Curtis Grimes.
   Although no one knows for sure how Ieshia became infected,
Russell-Brown and Mrs. Williams believe it was through a blood
transfusion she received shortly after she was born.
   ``They both had transfusions in the newborn period because they
were premature,'' says Russell-Brown. ``And the only logical
explanation, I assume that she got infected by the virus from one of
those transfusions. But again, they both had blood, and whose blood
Tyesha had and whose blood Ieshia had, I don't know. There was no
other exposure.''
   While Oleske does not rule out blood transfusion as the cause, he
suspects Ieshia was infected through her natural mother, although
her refusal to be tested for AIDS leaves that possibility uncertain.
   If so, one explanation why only she and not Tyesha was stricken
might be very small differences in the blood supply to the placenta,
the organ through which a fetus receives nourishment from the
mother's circulatory system.
   ``Sometimes ... in one placenta you see a different flow of blood
so that it has more exposure to the virus,'' Oleske says.
   Whatever the source of the virus, it gives the child little
respite. At school, Ieshia slips into the hall to swallow AZT, a
life-prolonging drug she takes every six hours.
   Even at home, between the slides and the swings, she has to stop
for treatment. A nurse, Michele LaPadura, comes by daily to give her
therapy, chopping at her tiny chest with cupped hands to clear her
lungs of mucus.
   If there is an explanation for Ieshia's survival, part of it is
the good care and love she has received, says Oleske.
   ``Ieshia is a very special girl who is one of the few cases that
give me hope and encouragement,'' he says. ``Some days it gets
pretty bleak taking care of so many children that die. She's one of
the cases that I'm most gratified with. She has survived to the day
when we now have drugs like AZT that may in fact help cure her.''
   Children's Hospital staffers have been counseling both girls. ``I
think to a limited degree, to their age abilities, they can
understand,'' says Oleske.
   For Tyesha, AIDS means she could lose a beloved sister.
   ``Every time a hospital stay comes,'' Mrs. Williams says, ``you
can tell the fear in her. When we go to the clinic, you can see her
worrying. Then when we come back, she's so thrilled to see us.''
   Ieshia's understanding, despite a lifetime of sickness, reflects
a child's belief in a better future. ``When I grow up,'' she says,
``I want to be a nurse because I want to help sick people.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``The Big Picture''</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Film opens wide Sept. 15</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Satire, George S. Kaufman once warned, ``is what closes on
Saturday night.'' That didn't stop him from collaborating with Moss
Hart on ``Once in a Lifetime,'' the biting spoof of early Hollywood.
   The New Hollywood with its buzz-phrases (``let's take a meeting
and do lunch'') and numbing vapidity and undercurrent of deceit
could certainly provide ample material for a biting satire. ``The
Big Picture'' isn't it. Christopher Guest and his collaborators are
not Kaufman and Hart, and their film proves annoyingly flat, like a
series of shaggy-dog stories without punchlines.
   More was expected of Guest, who contributed some of the funniest
sequences to ``Saturday Night Live'' as writer and actor. He also
co-wrote and appeared in Rob Reiner's clever send-up of the rock
world, ``This Is Spinal Tap.''
   Guest, who makes his feature debut as a director with ``The Big
Picture,'' co-wrote the story with Michael Varhol (who also
produced). They wrote the screenplay along with Michael McKean. They
obviously took delight in conveying ``inside'' jokes. Trouble is,
many of them are too inside for the layman.
   ``The Big Picture'' opens promisingly enough with an awards
program at the National Film Institute. Student films, most of them
grossly pretentious, are screened. The winner is Nick Chapman (Kevin
Bacon), an eager young filmmaker with high principles and a
supportive girlfriend (Emily Longstreth).
   Nick's award draws him into the Hollywood vortex. He is wooed by
a variety of smarmy agents and signs with an Oriental-looking loony
(Martin Short, who receives no billing).
   A big-talking studio chief (J.T. Walsh) hires Nick to direct his
original script. With dizzying speed, Nick betrays his principles,
dilutes his script, betrays his best friend (McKean) and abandons
his girlfriend for a starlet.
   Then one morning, Nick picks up the trade papers and finds the
studio boss has been fired. Nick's project is dropped, and he
becomes unemployable. After hitting bottom, he directs a music video
that makes him hot again. He is able to film his original script,
hire his best friend and reconcile with his girl.
   If Guest intended a Hollywood morality tale, it doesn't work. The
characters are standard cliches, and it's hard to believe that
Nick's dopey screenplay would get a second look at any studio. Kevin
Bacon does his best to breathe life into the weak-willed Nick, but
the character is hard to like or admire. Brief roles are played by
Eddie Albert, June Lockhart, John Cleese and Roddy McDowall.
   The Columbia release is rated PG-13, mostly for language. Running
time: 100 minutes.

   ``Cousins'' (Paramount Home Video. VHS, Beta. Rated PG-13)
   
   ``Cousins'' carries no suggested retail price because it is
intended for the rental market. Good idea, because it's hardly worth
the celluloid on which it's filmed.
   ``Cousins'' is Joel Schumacher's graceless treatment of
Jean-Charles Tacchella's charming 1976 comedy, ``Cousin, Cousine.''
Schumacher makes the mistake of trying to closely follow the
original. Both open with a rousing family wedding scene in which the
husband and wife of different couples meet, run off for a little
sexual fling and leave their respective mates waiting at the
catering hall for their returns. The cuckholded spouses start up a
harmless flirtation and friendship and eventually have an affair of
their own.
   But where the original danced lightly with the passions and
eccentricities of French culture, the new version applies the thin,
moralistic veneer of an American TV sitcom with idiot level dialogue
and conviction. Simply put, the French have a different way of
viewing adultery.
   Ted Danson, as compelling in this role as a bottle of warm, flat
champagne, plays Larry Kozinski who is married to Tish, played with
airhead finesse by Sean Young. Isabella Rossellini, perhaps cast in
this movie to give it some sort of continental class and a little
sunshine, is Maria Hardy, an understanding wife and mother married
to a brutish bore named Tom (William Petersen) who sells Suburus but
who likes to say he sells BMWs.
   The truly comic moments (which were many in ``Cousin, Cousine'')
are diluted in ``Cousins'' by weighty and blunt situations: When Tom
realizes Maria and Larry are also having an affair, he confronts
Larry in typical Hollywood macho style with, ``If you go near my
wife again, I'll kill you.'' Petersen is more Fred Flintstone than
Valentino.
   What saves ``Cousins'' from utter and total oblivion is the
wonderful patter between Larry's father (Lloyd Bridges) and Larry's
son, Mitch (Keith Coogan). Grandpa and grandson have a bucolic
moment over some girlie magazines, and the scene in which Mitch
helps grandpa Vince prepare for a date with Maria's mother (Norma
Aleandro) is worth the rental.
   A totally unnecessary addition to ``Cousins'' is the subplot
involving the boy-girl problems Tom and Maria's daughter experiences
in pre-school. Who cares?
   Perhaps Hollywood will one day realize that some things get lost
in translation. One would think the lesson would have been learned
in 1983 when Jim McBride remade Jean-Luc Godard's classic 1960 film
``Breathless'' into a pathethic and misguided movie. It starred
Richard Gere, who was embarrassing as he attempted to take on the
role Jean-Paul Belmondo had created in the original.
   Something gets lost in the translation as Hollywood puts its neon
wand to French confections. If it ain't broke, don't fix it...

   ``Tap'' (RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95.
Rated)
   
   Movie audiences have yearned for those splashy, joyous, romantic
musicals of the 1930s, '40s and '50s when boy met girl, boy lost
girl, boy got girl back and everybody lived happily everafter,
dancing all the way to the altar.
   Nick Castle, whose father choreographed many of those wonderful
Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers vehicles, attempts to bring back those
golden dance movies with ``Tap,'' a love letter to hoofers great and
small.
   Starring Gregory Hines and some of the greatest tap kings living,
``Tap'' features excellent dancing and a splendid exuberance.
Unfortunately, the movie holds back; the dance sequences never seem
to totally reach their potential, and on the small screen they may
be lost altogether.
   One production number, in which Hines takes a club full of tap
fans out to Times Square to feel and hear the beat and rhythms of
the city (such as cars going over metal plates in the road or
construction crews thumping the pavement) and marks out a dance. The
number starts out well, luring the viewer to the rhythms and moves.
Then it fizzles.
   Another disappointment is the wistful roof-top soft shoe
performed by Hines and the lovely Suzzanne Douglas to ``Cheek to
Cheek.'' It's a romantic Fred and Ginger take-off that never really
gets off. How sad.
   The biggest problem with ``Tap'' is Castle's script and story
line. Max (Hines) is a genius dancer who unfortunately finds
second-story work more to his liking than hoofing. After a stint in
jail, he returns to New York where he hooks up with the hoods again.
At the same time, his mentor, Little Mo (Sammy Davis Jr.) encourages
him to resume his dancing and even tries to turn him on to a new tap
innovation _ amplified shoes.
   The plot, though, gets in the way of the dancing. It's not
compelling, poignant or interesting enough. The tap dancing,
however, is.
   Hines, perhaps the greatest contemporary tap stylist around these
days, is marvelous. His supporting cast includes Savion Glover, a
14-year-old hoofer who one day will make the same claim. There are
also Sandman Sims, Bunny Briggs, Harold Nicholas, Jimmy Slyde and
Steve Condos _ some of the dancers who helped define and perfect the
art and craft of tap in the 20th century.
   Forget the story. View ``Tap'' as a tribute to the great ones and
to appreciate what tap dancing was all about before Broadway and
Hollywood took away its snap and crackle.

   ``The End of the Innocence'' (Geffen) _ Don Henley
   
   On the title cut of ``The End of the Innocence,'' Don Henley
interrupts his seduction of a woman to grouse about Ronald Reagan.
Best of my love, indeed.
   Henley sounds cranky on much of the rest of his new album, too.
And no wonder _ the guy is undergoing some serious transitions. On
Side 1 alone, he tells of a lover about to leave him (``I Will Not
Go Quietly''), another already in his past (``New York Minute'') and
a third that he hopes is in his future (``The Last Worthless
Evening'').
   Such emotional clutter would rob most folks of their sanity; it
robs Henley of his hooks. The tally for ``The End of the Innocence''
reads 53 minutes of music, no memorable melodies.
   Also absent is the keen social commentary that has marked the
ex-Eagle's best solo work. Here Henley stoops to attacking the most
obvious of targets, evangelists (``Little Tin God'').
   The supporting cast includes Bruce Hornsby, W. Axl Rose, Edie
Brickell, Take 6, Mike Campbell and Danny Kortchmar, so talent isn't
lacking. But inspiration is. Much of the record has the spark of a
demo tape.
   Henley had a hand in writing all 10 songs. He co-produced, played
the drums and sang all lead and some backup vocals. As the title cut
suggests, Henley might be trying to do too many things at once.

   Piano Quintet in A, the ``Trout,'' by Franz Schubert; Piano
Quartet in G minor, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart; Artur Schnabel and
the Pro Arte Quartet (EMI).
   
   Artur Schnabel, giant of 20th-century pianists and superlative
Beethoven interpreter, is reported to have said: ``I play Beethoven
to make my living; Schubert I play for love.'' His loving treatment
of the ``Trout'' can be heard on this EMI reissue of a 1935
recording, previously released on Arabesque.
   The interpretation may put off some listeners at first, but it
grows on you after a number of hearings. Schnabel's occasional
rhythmic flexing evokes an earlier romantic style, as do the string
players' tendency to slide between notes.
   The sound quality is not the greatest. The remastering from 78s
is uneven, the background noise considerable. But first violinst
Alphonse Ounnou's sweet tone and Schnabel's direct, lucid reading of
the notes shine through.
   The performance is brisk and muscular, but not so much that
Schubert's fleeting changes of color and mood are sacrificed. In the
first movement, phrases seem to build through their own natural
momentum. The cello and viola of the Pro Arte, a Belgian quartet
founded in 1912 and one of the most prominent before World War II,
sing beautifully in the Andante.
   The scherzo is the least successful of the movements, with a not
very appealing percussive, militaristic quality. The tempi in the
fourth movement variations never seem quite right, but that problem
is straightened out in the forceful finale.
   The wonderful Mozart G minor quartet was recorded a year earlier.
Schnabel and the Pro Arte members give a clean, square-cut
rendition. More than in the Schubert, the pianist's singing tone and
uncluttered phrasing come out.

   Before the B-52's became rock stars, they were
friends. After 10 years and six albums, they're still close. So
close that when guitarist Ricky Wilson died of cancer in 1985, the
four surviving members stayed together.
   ``It seemed like at that moment we weren't going to continue,''
said vocalist Kate Pierson. ``But we kept hanging around together.
We helped each other. I just felt we kept wanting to do music. Being
friends, we found a lot of strength in each other.''
   So close they need an outside producer because nobody wants to
give orders.
   ``We all have different strong points, but there's no leader,''
Pierson said.
   ``It's been a problem in some ways, but creatively it's good.
Everybody is more satisfied, no one's left out. It's very
laissez-faire; you can't force creativity. The fact we all
collaborate so much is what gives us our unusual sound.''
   They are rock's most subversive cartoon, spreading their message
under bouffant hairdos and giggly vocals. The B-52's combine the
inspired silliness of 1960s surf groups with the social conciousness
of the folk-protest music that Pierson performed in high school.
Imagine The Flintstones warning against deforestation or The Jetsons
defending animal rights.
   ``Our influences are really eclectic,'' Pierson said. ``Stephen
Foster. Brazilian music. We're really influenced by Patti Smith and
Captain Beefheart. We've been influenced by movie soundtracks, TV,
it's just in the air.''
   It all started at a Chinese restaurant in Athens, Ga. Five
friends _ Ricky Wilson, his sister, Cindy, Keith Strickland, Fred
Schneider and Pierson. Five straws and one drink: Flaming Volcano.
   They had never played together before but thought it might be fun
to try.
   ``We went to our friend Owen's house and started writing,''
Strickland said. ``We had no notion of starting a band. We just
wound up at his house because there were instruments and a tape
recorder. Owen went upstairs to write a letter, otherwise he would
have been in the band, too.
   ``We started playing at parties and had great response. People
wanted us to play more. We would go to parties and dress up and be
ridiculous. The slang term for bouffant hairdo was B-52 and that was
what we called ourselves. That's the most calculated thing we've
ever done.''
   A self-proclaimed ``trashy little band,'' the B-52's quickly
became a favorite of critics and dancers with ``Rock Lobster,''
``Dance the Mess Around'' and ``Private Idaho.'' What other band
could sing ``I want to kiss your pineapple!'' and make audiences beg
for more?
   ``We had this perpetual innocence,'' Pierson said, ``like the
film `Born Yesterday.' We still have this enthusiasm, like we just
started. I don't feel jaded at all.''
   Their songs come from everywhere: the vegetarian restaurant where
``Rock Lobster'' was written; a billboard reading ``Topaz, the Right
Choice,'' which provided the title for ``Topaz'' off ``Cosmic
Thing,'' their new album; even a psychic, who predicted the band
would use the word ``Topaz'' in a song.
   ``I was standing in a door of a shopping mall,'' Strickland
recalled, and two different songs were playing in the same key. I
was thinking, `Ahhhh.' I loved it. The subliminal will register,
there's always an awareness.''
   For ``Cosmic Thing,'' the B-52's decided some stripping down was
in order after making increasing use of studio effects over the
years.
   ``We wanted to approach this as a band,'' Pierson said, ``not as
a studio album. The first two albums, we played the stuff ourselves.
We didn't overdub anything that we couldn't do live.
   ``The next three albums we did more and more overdubs and our
last record, `Bouncing off the Satellites,' was the most produced.
We were able to add layers of sounds and do some different moods,
but now we really have this urge to rebel. No more drum machines!''
   Rebels or not, they still needed a producer and used both Nile
Rodgers, the ex-Chic guitarist who has worked with Madonna and Diana
Ross, and Don Was of Was (Not Was).
   ``Rodgers has this reputation of being slick, but he was really
the opposite,'' Pierson said. ``He understood our approach
immediately. We wanted to do the whole album with Nile, but his
schedule is so crazy, he's booked until the year 2000. We thought
we'd better call someone else.''
   They tried several producers at the suggestion of their record
label, but none worked out until the group met Was, who recently
worked on Bonnie Raitt's popular ``Nick of Time'' album.
   ``Cosmic Thing'' could be the movie soundtrack to ``Around the
World in 10 Songs,'' starting cheerfully with the title track's
``Batman'' riff, gradually darkening with ``Roam,'' the lead song
off Side 2, and concluding hopefully with ``Follow Your Bliss,'' an
instrumental.
   ``We made a sequence in the studio,'' Strickland said, ``and it
didn't make any sense at all. The final order was sort of an
accident. I realized we could do it a certain way, take you on a
journey and back again. Side 1 relates to Southern rural imagery.
Side 2 becomes more global, especially `Channel Z.'
   ```Follow Your Bliss' is like closing credits. `Cosmic Thing'
sort of says what the album's about, standing on your own two feet,
`Shake that Cosmic Thing.' It's your birthright to enjoy life.
`Follow Your Bliss' is kind of saying the same thing.''

   Bob Schaeffer must know something about the SAT.
   In 1965, as a high school student aiming for ultra-selective
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he scored a perfect 800 on
the math portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test, and an only
slightly less sublime 700-plus on the verbal section.
   Not enough to stand out in the MIT crowd _ but not too shabby,
considering the average U.S. pupil scores about 500 points lower.
   Schaeffer shrugs off his standardized test prowess, calling his
scores ``embarrassingly high'' when pressed to reveal them. He has
spent the last four years waging a highly publicized war on the SAT
which he believes is biased, flawed and ought to be banished from
students' lives.
   In 1985, he and fellow testing foe John Weiss formed FairTest, a
Cambridge, Mass.-based research and lobbying organization that has
emerged as the principal gadfly of the College Board, which sponsors
the SAT, and the Education Testing Service, which administers the
test taken by more than a million college-bound students each year.
   Schaeffer, Weiss and Barbara Beckwith have co-written ``Standing
Up to the SAT,'' (ARCO Books, $6.95). It contains a foreword by
women's rights activist Eleanor Smeal and an afterword by consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, who co-wrote an earlier investigative
broadside against the SAT in 1978.
   ``Standing Up to the SAT'' is best described as a guerrilla test
preparation book. The SAT is the enemy, it says. Here are the tricks
you need to defeat it.
   The chapter headings tell the story: ``How to Outwit the Verbal
SAT''; ``How to Outfox the Math SAT''; ``How to Outsmart the Test of
Standard Written English.''
   Students who can't afford $600 or so for private coaching or test
preparation classes will find dozens of invaluable test-taking tips.
   On the verbal portion, for example, the authors counsel students
to leave the reading comprehension questions for last. They take the
longest to do, and count the same as the analogy and antonym
questions.
   On the math, the book advises students to write the figuring in
the test book. Don't work out complicated questions in your head.
Later you can see your steps clearly and catch careless errors. And
the book advises students to memorize the six formulas and eight
math terms and definitions printed at the beginning of every SAT to
avoid wasting precious test time flipping back to them.
   Such tip mongering gives the College Board fits. The SAT has long
held a mystique as an educational barometer, a test supposedly able
to objectively predict college success. To suggest that a student
can be coached for the SAT, that the test can be ``outwitted,''
``outfoxed'' or ``outsmarted,'' is heresy.
   The bias charges leveled by FairTest, repeated at length in the
opening chapters of this book, have been widely reported.
Legislators, courts and even some colleges have begun to question
whether the SAT is unfair to women and minority students _ unfair,
perhaps, to all students.
   But students reading these charges for the first time in this
book should be aware that they are getting one side of a complicated
educational debate.
   To demonstrate the SAT's alleged race and income bias, the
authors reproduce questions that in several cases haven't been used
in years.
   And they offer this sample analogy question supposedly showing
how unfair the SAT is to poorer students:
   Dividends: Stockholders:
   (A) investments: corporations
   (B) purchases: customers
   (C) royalties: authors (the correct answer)
   (D) taxes: workers
   (E) mortgages: homeowners
   Why, it could be asked, is it unfair to expect college-bound kids
to have some nodding familiarity with concepts such as taxes,
customers, investments or mortgages, even if he or she is not rich?
   The SAT is sex-biased against women, the book further asserts. On
average, girls score 43 points lower on the math and 13 points lower
on the verbal than boys, yet their grades are generally higher than
boys' grades in those subjects in high school and college. The
reason, says the book: SAT questions feature boys and male topics
far more often than girls or topics of interest to females.
   But can test critics really prove that girls can't understand a
question because it features ``Dick'' instead of ``Jane''? Mightn't
there be some truth to the College Board's explanation that schools
and parents are subtly steering girls away from advanced math in
high school?
   The books ends with a call to arms to students and others to
pressure testmakers, colleges and others to make the SAT and other
standardized tests fairer.
   ``Stand up to unfair standardized exams,'' Nader exhorts in his
closing essay. ``That is the only way to end the intellectual
serfdom that tests such as the SAT represent.''
   Perhaps the best single piece of advice in this book is a lesson
Schaeffer obviously learned himself with his disdain for his own
superb SAT scores: ``Don't internalize your SAT score. High or low,
your score measures only a tiny part of who you are. A high score
doesn't make you a genius. If you score low, that doesn't mean
you're `dumb' and not college material.''

   Rodney Crowell may be this year's newcomer
to mainstream country music. But behind the success of his Diamonds
&amp; Dirt album is a solid career that's touched nearly every facet of
the music industry.
   Crowell's older fans, his ``cult following,'' as he puts it, kept
his wide-ranging talents a secret until recently.
   He's written hits for big-name artists. He produced the brilliant
King's Record Shop LP for his wife, Rosanne Cash, and he helped make
a legend out of Emmylou Harris as a member of her Hot Band in the
1970s.
   But 1989 was his year.
   Diamonds &amp; Dirt, Crowell's fifth album, has produced four No. 1
singles on the country charts _ the first time four top singles have
been written, produced and performed by the same artist. The album
also earned him three Grammy Awards, and the Academy of Country
Music named him its top new male vocalist. It was an honor the
38-year-old performer might have scoffed at had he not won.
   ``It's funny how you can justify either side of the coin,''
Crowell said. ``If you don't win, you say, `I'm an artist, awards
don't mean anything.' Then, suddenly you win, and the hypocrite
comes out and says, `Hey, this is not bad.'''
   Last month, Warner Records released The Rodney Crowell
Collection, his first ``greatest hits'' album. Crowell's new LP for
CBS Records is due in October.
   He recently talked about his new popularity and his ``arrival''
after years in the background.
   Not long ago, he watched his wife's career take off while his own
talents were tucked away in the production booth.
   ``I got sidetracked in the role of producer a few years back, and
I got involved to the point where I couldn't give any attention to
my own personal desires,'' he said. ``And while doing that, Rosanne
was having a great deal of success. It was really tough. The bottom
line was that she was doing better than me.''
   Crowell doesn't like to hear labels pinned on his music, though
he acknowledges that country music radio is his ``window to the
world.''
   His disdain for categories started when he was a child in Austin,
Texas, he said.
   ``The '60s was a good time musically because I would go to the
store and buy a Beatles record, a Merle Haggard record, a Buck Owens
record and a Flatt and Scruggs record _ all on the same rack. They
didn't separate them. I'd buy them at the grocery store.
   ``That's why I bristle when somebody pegs it all down, because I
would easily go from country to something classical _ Ravel _ to the
Rolling Stones. Music is something to be appreciated for how it
feels, how it speaks to your heart, not your mind.''
   Crowell hooked up with Emmylou Harris in 1974, after she recorded
some of his songs and sent out word she wanted to meet the young
songwriter. He visited her at her home in the Washington, D.C., area
and later followed her to Los Angeles.
   ``She came through Austin, where I was hanging out at the time,
handed me an airline ticket and said, `C'mon, move to L.A.,' and I
said, `OK.'''
   Before long, Crowell was tagged ``the next Gram Parsons,'' a
reference to the man considered one of the founders of country rock.
Parsons, who discovered Harris and later recorded with her, died in
1972 of a heroin overdose.
   ``I didn't know Gram Parsons,'' Crowell said. ``I suppose that
comparison is only natural given the fact that Emmylou was his
collaborator, then he died, and I became her collaborator.''
   The Hot Band proved a strong foundation for Crowell's first album
in 1978, ``Ain't Livin' Long Like This,'' which featured Ry Cooder,
Dr. John, Ricky Skaggs and James Burton. Like the albums that
followed, it received strong critical acclaim but had little
commercial success.
   At the time, Cash was an aspiring actress also living in Los
Angeles. But the two met by chance in Nashville, Tenn., where they
both happened to be visiting.
   ``I found out she lived in L.A. We became friends and that turned
into a romance,'' Crowell said.
   When she left acting for a singing career, Cash asked Crowell to
produce her first album. He has since produced all of Cash's albums.
   In the past few years, the couple have weathered well-publicized
drug and marital problems. They now live in Nashville with their
four children, and the hard times and jealousy seem to be things of
the past.
   If anything, Cash's success seems to be more of an inspiration
than a threat to Crowell.
   ``That's one thing about Rosanne; she's a real seeker _ of any
kind of growth: emotional, artistic, intellectual. She is very
creative and is not complacent.''

<HEAD>Companies Seek Ways To Keep Older Workers, Attract Retirees</HEAD>

   Sylvia Corvo tired of retirement and went back
to work when she was nearly 72. Now 80, she doesn't plan to retire
again unless poor health forces her _ and she doesn't think that's
likely any time soon.
   She's among a growing number of people returning to work or
staying on the job after they turn 65. And Corvo, one of two
Travelers Insurance Co. retirees who run a 700-person job bank, says
many return for the same reason she did.
   ``I had been retired for seven years, and I woke up very bored
one day and thought I ought to do something. I thought maybe I'd
take some courses.''
   But that day's mail brought a letter from Travelers, where she
had worked as an executive secretary and spent nine years running
the suggestion plan. The company was collecting names of retired
workers who might want to return for part-time or occasional work.
Was she interested?
   She has worked at the job bank Thursdays, Fridays and alternate
Wednesdays ever since, keeping track of who is available, their
skills, and what jobs need to be filled. ``We're very proud of our
job bank. ... And we save the company about a million dollars a
year. That's not bad.''
   Travelers isn't the only company seeking out workers who once
would have been considered over the hill. McDonald's prints
applications for ``McMasters'' on its tray liners. Day's Inns of
America Inc. held a Senior Power job fair in May that attracted 634
companies and 5,000 older people in 26 states. Polaroid Corp. offers
gradual retirement for those who want to continue part-time.
   Companies are hiring or retraining older workers to stave off an
impending labor shortage as baby boomers age.
   ``The United States is ahead of Europe in having the elements of
such programs,'' said Peter Plett, an International Labor
Organization employee who is studying programs for older workers in
North America and Europe.
   ``European business is still focusing on younger workers. ... But
Europeans will have to face a change from this youth wave in the
next few years,'' Plett said at a National Council on the Aging
seminar earlier this year.
   ``There is really no choice. If we're going to increase
productivity and meet the needs of an aging workforce, we're going
to have to totally change the concept of retirement,'' said Daniel
E. Knowles, vice president for human resources and planning at
Grumman Aerospace Corp.
   The nation's average age is rising as the baby boomers get older
and medical advances extend life expectancy. Meanwhile, the labor
market has gotten tighter, said Philip Rones of the Bureau of Labor
Standards.
   ``We have 3 million fewer younger workers than we did 10 years
ago. We're in the middle of the nation's longest peacetime
expansion. Unemployment is at a 15-year low,'' Rones said.
   The dearth of teen-agers coupled with a tight labor market has
prompted McDonald's to look for older people to work as everything
from burger-flippers to managers for its fast-food restaurants.
Thirty percent of American men aged 65 and older held part-time jobs
in 1960; by 1986 that had risen to 48 percent. For women, the
increase was from 43 percent to 61 percent.
   ``We recruit from our customers,'' said Stanley Stein, a senior
vice president at the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company. McDonald's says
older workers can set their hours and won't work enough to lose
Social Security benefits.
   That possible loss of Social Security or pensions is one of the
biggest obstacles to keeping older workers. Those 65 to 70 can make
$8,800 this year and not lose any benefits. Under 65, it's $6,480.
Generally, $1 in benefits is lost for each $2 earned over the limit.
At 70, earnings don't affect benefits.
   When Travelers set up its job bank in 1981, it had to change
restrictions that kept workers from collecting pensions if they kept
working, said Harold Johnson, who was the company's personnel
director at the time.
   ``We can only work 960 hours a year. That's approximately six
months,'' said Corvo. Some people fill in for those on sick leave or
vacation, others work regularly one, two or three days a week. A few
work full-time, six months at a stretch, then take six months off.
All are classified as temporary workers and paid the midpoint for
each job's salary.
   Johnson, now with a company that trains executives, said that
when Travelers set up the job bank it also eliminated mandatory
retirement and set up a plan for workers who wanted to continue
working part-time rather than full-time after 65.
   Not every company, though _ or even a majority _ is worried about
a labor shortage or looking toward older people as its solution.
   ``Downsizing is a fact of life in American industry and older
employees are the most affected,'' Johnson said. ``And dozens of
companies are still laboring under the myths that we have blown
away.''
   The myths include belief that a worker's ability deteriorates
with age and that older workers will cost a company more in sick
leave and medical benefits than their work is worth, said NCOA
conference participants.
   Older workers at Days Inns have a better attendance rate and stay
longer than younger workers, said spokeswoman Laura Myers McCoy. The
headquarters in Atlanta loses an average 40 percent of its
reservation agents a year, but ``the turnover rate among the older
workers ... is less than 1 percent.''
   Dave Thomas, 71, was a structural engineer most of his
professional life and was in charge of scheduling design and
construction of the Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority when he
retired in 1982. Now he puts in 5{ hours a day for $6.20 an hour as
a reservations clerk for Days Inn. ``It's been a lot of fun _
talking to different people, and different kinds of people. I'll
keep working as long as I enjoy it. And as long as they'll let me.''
   Knowles said Grumman's highly trained workforce has always tended
to be older than average _ something which itself refutes the belief
that a younger worker is better. The average age at Grumman rose
from 37 to 45 from 1970 to 1977 as a result of 13,600 layoffs that
were based on department rankings of ability rather than on age or
seniority.
   ``When we put a man on the moon 20 years ago, we made the lunar
module,'' he said. ``Our past president told me, `It wasn't a bunch
of kids who put a man on the moon. It was a bunch of middle-aged and
older workers.'''

   In a land where the elderly have long been
venerated, Miyoko Morita and Misako Tanaka spend their days looking
after old people, whose plight worries them so much that ``we can't
let ourselves die.''
   Japan's rapid transition to an industrial power has been
accompanied by an equally swift aging of its population. One in five
Japanese will be over 65 years old by 2010, compared to one in 10,
or 12 million, now.
   The Japanese live longer than anyone else _ men to an average
75.6 years and women to 81.4. They once could count on spending
their old age as respected senior members of extended households in
close-knit neighborhoods or villages.
   Today, for many elderly Japanese those ``happy golden years''
have turned gray, says Mrs. Morita, 74, a widow who lives with her
son's family. She and Ms. Tanaka, 65, take calls on a hotline and
fight for more government help.
   Crowded in cities, many families have no space for grandparents.
Spiraling land costs have pushed the elderly out of their homes as
old neighborhoods are replaced by apartment buildings where everyone
minds their own business.
   The change has forced many to turn to the government for help
finding jobs, housing and health care, needs traditionally met by
families. But officials say social welfare programs are already
overloaded; as the number of incapacitated elderly rises, this
burden may overwhelm the system, says Hiroto Itami of Tokyo's
welfare planning department.
   ``The housing that was built after the war for young couples,
small houses and apartments with no elevators, isn't suitable for
old people,'' Itami says.
   Japanese families have shrunk _ on average from five people in
1955 to three in 1985 _ making it difficult if not impossible for
families to care for older relatives without help. Caring for the
aged is considered women's work, but more than half of all married
women work.
   More than half of all Japanese think an extended family structure
is best, surveys show, but only 22 percent of all families have
three generations living under one roof. ``In some cases, they can't
manage by themselves or even with their families,'' Itami says.
``But there aren't enough nursing homes or low-income housing units
for the elderly.''
   In the Tokyo area, home to over 1 million people 65 and older,
nine public nursing homes accommodate a total of 2,700 people;
another 2,000 are on waiting lists. Nationwide, 3,090 public nursing
homes house 216,000 people.
   The government plans to build nursing homes and low-cost housing
for the elderly, and to expand at-home medical services and an
experimental system of emergency alarm pendants that let sick or
injured elderly people call for help.
   In the meantime, the Health and Welfare Ministry estimates
380,000 aged are bedridden in hospitals. The government employs
150,000 women part-time to help families care for 220,000 bedridden
elderly living at home. With 1.3 million elderly living alone and
another 3.47 million elderly couples also on their own, needs far
outweigh the services available, Itami says.
   Predictably, the burgeoning demand for services has spawned a
``silver industry'' for families with enough money to pay for
high-quality housing and medical care. Such services aren't cheap.
Entrance fees for the least expensive private old-age homes average
$106,000 to $212,000, in addition to monthly food and maintenance
fees of $425 to $700.
   The average monthly income of couples in which the husband was 60
or older was about $1,343 in 1987. About $959 of that was from
pensions, according to a national survey of household income and
spending. Spending was $1,481.
   Financial concerns and habit send half of all retirees back to
work, but Ichiro Kami of the Labor Ministry says, ``Most elderly can
only get low-paying jobs like guards or janitors, work that younger
people don't want.''
   The elderly face housing discrimination, too. Skyrocketing land
prices have forced many out of their old wooden homes due to heavy
tax burdens and strong pressure from land developers to make way for
new buildings, Itami says.
   When aged people do reluctantly give in to the pressures to move,
they often find closed doors, says Ms. Tanaka. ``One woman I know
has plenty of money and is healthy and active, but landlords won't
accept her because they worry she might forget to turn off the gas
and start a fire.''
   The director of a shelter for the elderly in south Tokyo said 330
of 1,300 cases handled in 1987 were elderly homeless and that the
problem is growing.
   Mrs. Morita and Ms. Tanaka, who is a Roman Catholic nun, say
housing is a key worry of elderly callers to the hotline begun by
their volunteer group of 30 women this April. Callers also ask for
advice on finding home helpers and even graves. They are put in
touch with agencies that can help.
   A few call to discuss marriage problems, says Mrs. Morita.
``Families generally consider marriage by old people to be
embarassing and strongly object, but that's just not right.
   ``One lady just called to say she was so lonely, so I went to
spend the night. The situation is so bad we just can't let ourselves
die.''
   She chafes at the fact that elderly Japanese facing
discrimination and indifference often fatalistically give up because
they were brought up when the aged were sheltered and protected.
``Elderly people here don't know their rights. There's just no
concept of `silver power' here.
   ``We're trying to teach them. JKapan needs a `silver wave' of old
people learning to cope for themselves.''

   The aging of America means more older drivers
will travel tomorrow's roads, increasing the need for better ways to
judge who can safely drive and for cars and highways designed with
the elderly in mind.
   The nation's system of roads, traffic signs, cars, licensing and
training ``essentially was designed for healthy 25-year-olds,'' said
Adele Derby of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
``Our challenge is to adapt this system to preserve mobility and
promote the safety of older people.''
   For many older Americans, ``there may be no other possession so
highly prized'' as a driver's license, said Patricia Waller,
director of the University of Michigan Transportation Research
Insitute.
   ``When the older driver has difficulty with the system, too often
the reaction is `get the old codger off the road.' We can do better
than that.''
   People 65 and older comprise 12 percent of the population and
could account for 17 percent by 2020, nearly half of them over 75.
``States are not prepared to handle the growing number of very old
drivers or to identify those at high risk of accident involvement,''
the Transportation Research Board said last year.
   Because older people tend to drive less, their overall accident
rate is relatively low. But when mileage driven is considered, they
have a disproportionately higher crash rate than other age groups.
   This is true even though many older motorists modify their travel
habits to avoid difficult situations such as night driving, heavy
traffic, freeways and left-hand turns, Waller said.
   In addition, older drivers involved in accidents are more
vulnerable to injury. Motorists over 65 are three times more likely
to die than 20-year-olds from serious injuries of equal severity,
the research board found.
   ``There's a lot of interest building up out in the research arena
to attack this problem, which is good because this is becoming an
increasingly important problem _ how to increase both the mobility
and safety of older drivers,'' said Richard Waxweiler of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control.
   The CDC, NHTSA, Federal Highway Administration and National
Institute on Aging sponsored a conference here in August on
directions for research on older drivers. Organizers had expected
about 40 people, but the two-day session drew some 150 experts in
gerontology, medicine, transportation and other fields.
   A top priority, they concluded, should be more study of skills
needed to drive and how driving ability changes with age. That
knowledge, they reasoned, could lead to licensing tests, driver
training, cars and highway systems designed to help keep older
motorists safely on the roads.
   However, the government has little money targeted for research on
issues related to older drivers, Waxweiler warned. ``People who want
to do research on this problem will have to compete with all the
other research interests in this time of fiscal prudence.''
   Changes that help the elderly, like simpler dashboard displays,
better highway markings or more accurate licensing tests, will
benefit other drivers as well, research advocates say. And helping
older people keep their driving privileges will ease the burden on
family, friends and communities that otherwise might have to meet
their travel needs.
   ``We need to get away from the idea that the highway
transportation system is a given and that drivers must adapt to
whatever it is,'' Waller said. ``No one functions at optimal level
at all times.''
   Researchers hope to come up with driving tests that will remove
unsafe drivers while making travel safer for those who still can
drive, said Richard W. Pew, principal scientist at BBN Systems and
Technologies Corp. in Cambridge, Mass. ``Because we don't have
adequate testing, we take a lot of people off the road who don't
need to be off the road.''
   A recent NHTSA study of state licensing found the current system
fails to weed out some bad drivers and ``may suspend licenses
needlessly or discourage some qualified drivers from applying for
license renewal.''
   James Hedlund, NHTSA's director of driver and pedestrian
research, said the agency hopes states will move toward ``reasonable
performance-based license requirements. Our goal is not to institute
procedures based on age.''
   More than a dozen states impose special licensing or renewal
requirements based on age, a practice keenly opposed by the American
Association of Retired Persons.
   ``We're all going to age very differently and there is no
chronological age at which suddenly older drivers become a
problem,'' said AARP's Steve Stiles. ``There is no basis for
singling out the older driver.''
   Stiles said small steps are being taken to recognize and deal
with problems related to older drivers, but ``there are worlds of
improvement to be made.
   ``We are just beginning to recognize we can better people's
ability to drive and can create better environments for people to
drive in.''

   Alice Verhotz has lived in Asia and
negotiated the streets of crowded Singapore, but she began to
question her driving ability two years ago when she and her husband
moved to West Virginia.
   ``I'm absolutely terrified of some of the areas I have to drive
in. I get very nervous and grip the steering wheel hard. ...
   ``The bottom line is I'm 60 years old. If something happens I'm
not going to react or brake as quickly as an 18-year-old.''
   Mrs. Verhotz, who since has moved to Dallas, was among a group of
older motorists who took part in an experimental program and study
at West Virginia University designed to ensure that older drivers
are safer drivers.
   ``We don't want people on the road who aren't safe,'' said Dr.
Kenard McPherson, director of the West Virginia Traffic Safety
Center and a professor of safety at West Virginia University. ``But
then we don't want senior citizens taken off the road prematurely
because then they lose their freedom and become dependent on a
relative, a friend or some social agency.''
   McPherson's two-year study indicated that exercise, stress
management and driver education may help older people improve their
driving skills.
   ``We found that about a quarter of those in the study had given
up driving prematurely. ... They had skills as good as those as
people who were driving but they were taking themselves out of the
system because they didn't think they were good enough. We don't
want that to happen.''
   Eleanor Milam, 73, another participant in the study funded by the
American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety, said
she was surprised by her good marks on a screening test used by the
researchers.
   ``My kids say I'm a hot-rodder and sometimes I do drive too fast.
But I learned to watch my speed closer and be more observant,'' she
said. ``I also learned how not to be so afraid of those big trucks
on the highway, but I'll still pull over and stop to let them go by
if I have to.''
   About 12 percent of the nation's population is 65 or older, and
that number is expected to increase to about 17 percent by the year
2020, when more than 50 million older Americans will be eligible to
drive.
   ``I've never seen a traffic safety issue as hot as this one, with
the possible exception of drunk driving,'' said McPherson, who has
gotten requests for the program from across the United States and
several foreign countries.
   His study of 43 drivers aged 20-35 and 63 aged 60-75 tested
physical skills, reaction time, range of motion in seven joints, and
driving ability. It revealed that older drivers most commonly have
difficulty in situations that require visual skills or rapid
judgments. Many of these problems, McPherson said, may stem from a
general decline in physical fitness as they age.
   While driving skills often deteriorate after age 75, the study
said many elderly people are ``capable and safe'' and pose less risk
than many teens.
   The study points out the shortcomings of programs that
concentrate on reviewing rules and procedures, McPherson said. ``The
typical program gives them information as if information was going
to solve the problem.
   ``I don't know how information is going to help a person whose
ability to physically function behind the wheel is declining. ...
Our program is the first and the only one that provides for
behind-the-wheel training. It's expensive, but we've demonstrated
it's more effective.''
   The researchers found that many older people who are poor drivers
have trouble twisting their necks and torsos to check traffic when
changing lanes or backing up, he said. ``We would prescribe a
specific set of exercises to help improve the driver's flexibilty,
while reviewing with them how important it is not to rely just on
mirrors when switching lanes or backing up.''
   Drivers' improved observation habits resulted in better scores
for straight-line backing, parallel parking, intersection scanning
and checking both sides when changing lanes. However,
vehicle-handling skills like keeping in a lane or stopping at a
point, showed little, if any, improvement.
   ``We don't know all the answers,'' said McPherson. ``But we've
got the largest database in the world on older drivers and we're in
the process of reviewing it to further refine our program.''
   His goal is to refine the program so community groups and state
agencies can use it. ``There's no reason why a 70-year-old with good
driving skills can't sit down and tutor someone who doesn't.''

<TEXT>
   At an age when most men are into their third
decade of retirement, Harry H. Lipsig decided to start his second
law firm.
   With characteristic nerve and verve, the 87-year-old Lipsig _ one
of the nation's best-known personal-injury lawyers _ marched into
his longtime office several months ago, accompanied by a half-dozen
guards. With his men standing sentry _ the decision stemmed from a
feud with his partners _ Lipsig emptied his desk and pulled his name
from the door.
   Lipsig still appears in the courtroom occasionally but most of
the day-to-day trial work goes to his new partner and protege,
Bonita E. Zelman, a tough, no-nonsense lawyer and former assistant
Queens district attorney.
   But driven by a passion for perfection, enormous ambition,
endless energy and a gift for showbiz glitz, Lipsig has made
millions for himself, winning unheard-of settlements in apparently
unwinnable cases.
   It was Lipsig _ known at the courthouse as ``The Equalizer'' _
who got $740,000 for the family of a heart-attack victim by
convincing a jury the man had been frightened to death by a car that
rolled up on his lawn.
   It was Lipsig who once showed how an Acapulco hotel was actually
to blame when a shark attacked a guest. He argued that the hotel had
dumped garbage in the ocean and failed to warn guests that the
refuse might attract sharks.
   It was Lipsig _ in the dual roles of lawyer and Exhibit A _ who
argued last year that Dr. Hyman Chernow, a 71-year-old psychologist
run over by a squad car driven by a drunken officer, had years of
potential income-earning left.
   ``He could well have outlived me,'' Lipsig argued.
   City lawyers threw in the towel and settled the case for $1.25
million.
   Lipsig boasts that he's one of the reasons New York City employs
120 full-time personal-injury lawyers _ overworked lawyers at that _
and expects to shell out some $175 million this year in awards and
settlements.
   Like most lawyers in tort or personal-injury law, he works on a
contingency-fee basis, typically taking a third of the final award.
He sneers at those who say aggressive personal-injury lawyers have
caused insurance rates to skyrocket and are costing taxpayers
millions in suits against city governments.
   Then he tells of the feelings that ``well up within me very often
on behalf of some poor devil torn to shreds or living in that vilest
of prisons one can conceive _ not a prison cell that he has been
unjustly confined in, but the vilest prison of all _ helpless on a
hospital bed, paralyzed.''
   At his finest, Lipsig handles the emotions of a jury with the
finesse of a symphony conductor. ``Bore a jury and you've lost the
case,'' he says.
   But his victories are supported by long hours of meticulous
research _ Lipsig is obsessed about not being proved wrong or made
to appear the fool for overlooking something in the law.
   In a career that has lifted ambulance-chasing to a new level,
Lipsig has seen himself adoringly profiled in Time magazine and The
Wall Street Journal; he points proudly to the framed clippings on
the walls of his office.
   Modesty has no place in his vocabulary when he speaks of himself
or his practice. ``No lawyer who tries cases is any good unless he
has vanity. What is vanity but the blood brother of self-respect and
confidence?''
   The details of his personal and professional life are overseen by
Mary Lou Castillo, a 33-year-old woman adopted in January by Lipsig
and his wife.
   Some of his old partners say Ms. Castillo, the owner of a Mexican
restaurant and Lipsig's ever-present assistant, drove the wedge that
split him from his former firm. He says she merely helped open his
eyes.
   Lipsig, whose Ukrainian family immigrated to New York when he was
6, graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1929 when most of the good
legal work went to large and politically connected Irish firms.
Aspiring Jewish attorneys like Lipsig were left with minor criminal
cases, personal injury and the like.
   It has made him rich; Lipsig was getting a reported $5 million a
year when he quit his old firm. Still, he insists on working and is
driven to his office in lower Manhattan daily from his luxury
apartment near the United Nations.
   He still finds time to be host of a weekly cable TV talk show and
``Ask Harry,'' a radio show in which he offers legal advice. He has
no plans to take it easy. After all, he has a fledgling law firm to
get off the ground.

<HEAD>Offers That Sound Too Good To Be True Generally Are</HEAD>

   Have you ever gotten a postcard offering a
bargain-priced travel package? Or a phone call hawking a low-priced
vacation?
   These might be legitimate, but be wary. Many are run by scam
operators who each year bilk victims of hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   As a rule of thumb, if an offer sounds too good to be true, it
is. Too often there is a catch and the innocent victim doesn't
figure it out until it's too late. The scams take many forms but
here some of the most common identified by the Federal Trade
Commission and the American Society of Travel Agents.
   _You receive a phone call from a special operator, who is
prepared to offer you what sounds like an unbelievably low-priced
travel deal. You are told this is a very limited offer and you must
make a decision, or at least make a deposit by credit card, during
that initial phone conversation.
   _You receive a postcard or brochure in the mail offering a dream
vacation at a bargain price. It may read something like this: ``You
have been specially selected to receive a free trip...'' For more
details, you must call a special number, usually toll-free. Once
they've got you on the phone you will get the familiar high-pressure
pitch. The object is to get you on the phone and then get you to
reveal your credit-card number.
   _You are urged to pay a ``travel club'' membership fee of $50 to
$400 to get a travel package that includes round-trip air
transportation for one person and lodging for two. The catch? You
must buy a high-priced, round-trip ticket for the second person; you
can end up paying two to three times what it would have cost if you
bought your own tickets in advance through a reputable travel agency.
   _A clever twist is the offer of a free or nearly free vacation as
an inducement to visit a time-share condominium resort. Hidden
costs, which you learn about only when you arrive, tend to add up
quickly. You can be herded into a high-pressure sales pitch, with
lengthy in-person sales sessions calculated to break down your
resistance.
   When the offer of a trip seems to be too good to be true, ask a
travel agent about it. Agents can help you spot phony offers. You
also may want to check with your local Better Business Bureau or
Chamber of Commerce, or with the Consumer Affairs Department of the
American Society of Travel Agents. These organizations keep records
of complaints about fraudulent operations.
   Even while you're talking to a telephone salesperson, there are
ways to protect yourself. Ask detailed questions to make certain
what the price covers and what is not covered. Ask if there will be
additional charges later. Find out the names of the airports,
airlines, hotels and restaurants your package includes. You may wish
to contact these places yourself to double-check the arrangements.
Ask about cancellation policies and refunds. If the salesperson
can't give you detailed answers, this is probably not the deal for
you.
   The most important precaution you can take is never to give your
credit card number over the phone. The easiest way for a scam
operator to succeed is to get your card number, then charge your
account. Sometimes these operators will bluff by telling you they
need the number for verification purposes only.
   Make sure you get all information in writing before you agree to
buy anything. No legitimate business should expect you to make an
instant decision over the phone. Once you have all the information
in front of you, you can read the fine print and investigate the
company. Bear in mind that many fraudulent firms change their names
frequently to avoid detection.
   When in doubt about an offer, either say no or demand full
details by mail. There is an endless array of exciting travel
opportunities available to all, so you have nothing to lose by
making sure you're getting what you pay for.
   With today's selection of destinations, hotels, fares and
cruises, you're sure to find a legitimate trip that meets both your
needs and your budget.

<HEAD>A Rose Is a Rose, But Keep an Eye on Your Mock Orange</HEAD>

   A rose by any other name might smell as sweet, but
relying on common names of plants can be a recipe for disaster or
disappointment as gardeners moving to different climates after
retirement discover quickly.
   Botanical names are the answer. Don't recoil in horror.
   Camellia, bougainvillea, aloe, agave, eucalyptus, gardenia,
hibiscus, philodendron, verbena _ you're doing fine.
   The toughest part is the first step: deciding to insist on such
identification before spending money, time and effort on seeds or
plants. But it definitely ensures getting what you really want and
being able to locate and follow the best directions for taking care
of it.
   For example, in the eastern United States, a much-recommended
shrub is the ``mock orange.'' It is deciduous, has white, fragrant
flowers in late spring, medium-green foliage and needs minimal care.
It was a major asset everywhere in my former neighborhoods of
suburban New York City, Philadelphia and Washington.
   Botanically, it is the Philadelphus, a member of the
Saxifragaceae family.
   But ask for ``mock orange'' in Southern California and you'll
likely get Pittosporum tobira, an evergreen member of the
Pittosporaceae family with entirely different needs than
Philadelphus. About the only similarity is that the flowers smell
like blossoms on orange trees.
   After discovering this following a transfer to Los Angeles years
ago, I began an informal check on how many ``mock oranges'' were
being sold in this country. My counting stopped after 28 botanically
different ones.
   Pittosporum tobira is a rugged, magnificent performer outdoors in
wide areas of the West and does great as a house plant in
frost-prone regions, like the Midwest and East. It's great for
Southern California. But in Arizona, my retirement home, it sunburns
badly if grown under afternoon sun.
   As another example, at least a half-dozen different but
often-used shrubs are sold in Phoenix as birds of paradise.
   The most familiar, in spectacular bloom in August, is the
medium-sized one (Caesalpina pulcherrima) with orange-red-and-yellow
flower clusters. But even there the common name blurs. It is called
variously the ``Mexican bird of paradise'' or ``red bird of
paradise.'' Two yellow-flowering cousins also are often called
Mexican bird of paradise.
   The various birds of paradise sold here fall into two quite
different families: Strelitzia and Caesalpinia. Both are wonderful
in supplying a tropical effect. But once established, the
Caesalpinias need little if any supplemental water; take all the
heat, sun and cold of our desert; and grow quickly. The Strelitzias
like ample water and part shade; can be killed by temperatures in
the low 20s; and grow slowly.
   Many nurseries in recent years have added the botanical name to
the common on their labels. It's becoming common in most catalogs. A
fast way to learn is to use a reference that insists on the
botanical names while also giving common names.
   The botanical name of all roses, incidentally, begin with Rosa.
By definition, this is the genus: plants consisting of one or more
species from the same family, and sharing many characteristics.

<TEXT>
   Hilltop ruins here may not be the
fabled city of gold sought by conquistadors, but voyagers _ most of
them retirees _ lured by nuggets of history and mystery still occupy
Gran Quivira.
   Gran Quivira, part of Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument,
holds a spiritual treasure for them. The pueblo originally called
Cueloze was given its present name in 1780 _ a century after it was
abandoned _ after Indians near El Paso, Texas, told a Spanish
chronicler it was Coronado's lost city of gold.
   Archaeologists believe up to 10,000 people lived in the area.
Scholars aren't sure why they left but National Park Service
pamphlets suggest drought, starvation, Spanish cruelty, disease and
Apache raids all played a role.
   Centuries of wind have eroded the adobe, leaving walls of stacked
rocks on the brushy hilltop 60 miles south of Albuquerque.
   ``The silence up here: It's not a leaden silence. It's a silence
that speaks to me,'' says Anne Scheeler, a 69-year-old widow from
Lakeland, Minn., who completed her first stint as a volunteer this
spring. ``What am I doing in the midst of this wilderness of New
Mexico? But listen, you can hear the ghosts of the people who were
living here.''
   Scheeler has edited weekly newspapers, served in the Peace Corps
in Honduras in 1985 and in the Christian Appalachian Project in
Kentucky in 1987. Now she's in Alaska cooking at a camp for
handicapped children.
   Historian Eugene P. Link, 81, and his wife, Beulah, 77, of
Plattsburgh, N.Y., stay here every winter. Link, author of dozens of
articles, pamphlets and books on social history, worked on galley
revisions of his fourth book while at Gran Quivira the last two
winters.
   ``If you go up almost any time of the day to see the pueblo, it's
an extraordinary privilege,'' Mrs. Link said in a telephone
interview. ``The vistas are just incredible. You're by yourself, and
you can think. You can identify with all the people who have lived
there, what they thought.''
   ``There are some people who can't understand why we would ever
want to do such a thing,'' Link said. ``A lady came into the
Visitors Center. She was from New York City. She came in and threw
her arms in the air and said, `Where are the people?'''

   Estelle Brownstein thought a want ad reading
``Grandma Wanted,'' would lead to the perfect job, but she never
expected to end up as an honorary relative to hundreds through a
phone-in service for latchkey children.
   Mrs. Brownstein, a 66-year-old grandmother of five, is one of 35
``grandmothers by telephone'' to children who come home from school
to empty houses while one or both parents are at work.
   ``The ad ran `We need grandmas'. Well, I'm a grandma, so I
volunteered,'' she said. ``I found my niche in life. My niche is to
give of myself and get something in return.''
   ``Grandma, Please,'' lets children aged 6 to 13 call in when they
feel insecure, need a little advice or just want to talk, said
Monica Glaser, who directs the program at the Uptown Center Hull
House social service agency.
   And for some senior citizens, the need to talk is often as great
as that of the latchkey children. Many are confined to their homes,
she said.
   Being a senior citizen is not enough to qualify. Volunteers must
undergo screening and receive training before being ready for the
help line.
   Seniors must be warm and welcoming on the telephone and very
non-judgmental, Ms. Glaser said. The 33 grandmas _ and two grandpas
_ sing to the children on their birthdays, mediate fights and often
help with homework.
   ``Oh, they test you,'' Mrs. Brownstein said. ``There are some
children who want to see if they can get me mad, and I've done
pretty good so far.''
   Problem cases are directed to the help line's supervisor, a
psychologist who reviews the day's work and directs major problems
to appropriate agencies.
   The program, the first of its kind, was created in 1985 and has
spread to 30 cities in Maryland, New Jersey and Minnesota, Ms.
Glaser said. This year, it has received more than 800 calls, an
increase of 300 over last year. Operators handle 25 to 30 calls a
day between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., transferring calls to a volunteer at
home.
   The biggest problem the program has had to date is attracting
grandpas, she said. ``The name is `Grandma, Please,' you know. I
wish we could call it something else, but I have to tell them we're
kind of stuck with it.''

   The consumer groups who fought for acceptance
of generic drugs now find themselves defending an industry caught up
in charges of fraud and mismanagement. Despite the controversy, one
gadfly emphasizes there is no evidence generic drugs have caused any
medical harm.
   Moreover, pharmacists report few customers are switching to
generally more expensive brandname products.
   In the years since Congress approved marketing the brandname
clones, generic drugs have become a staple of the pharmaceutical
menu, accounting for about a third of all prescriptions filled in
the United States.
   The renewed attention to generics stems from disclosures of
improprieties that so far have been confined to a few generic drug
makers and Food and Drug Administration employees but that some fear
could be more widespread.
   ``At this point, there is no evidence that generic drugs have
resulted in any harm,'' reminds Dr. Sidney Wolfe, a physician and
head of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Ralph
Nader-founded consumer group that fought hard for generic drugs.
   Consumer reaction has been quiet.
   Although pharmacists say customers have been asking more
questions about the drugs they're getting, few have insisted on
switching to brandname products.
   ``We're surprised we're getting such a small response,'' said
John McHugh, president of the American Association of Retired
Persons Pharmacy Service, whose 12 pharmacies nationwide fill 30,000
prescriptions a day.
   AARP also worked hard to win acceptance of generic drugs, which
they say save consumers money since generics usually cost less than
the brandname drugs they mimic. And AARP officials say they continue
to support generic drugs.
   ``I don't see anything yet that would require us to backtrack,''
said John Rother, director of legislation, research and public
policy for AARP. ``So far, it appears to be a fairly isolated type
of malfeasance in the industry and within the FDA. It doesn't seem
to be something that can't be dealt with fairly quickly.''
   As evidence of its confidence, AARP last week was continuing to
fill prescriptions with Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc.'s generic
version of the widely prescribed hypertension brandname drug Dyazide.
   The FDA wants to remove Bolar's drug _ the last remaining generic
of Dyazide and the company's leading seller _ from the market
because of questions about sample testing when it was approved for
marketing in 1987.
   Earlier this summer, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Springfield
Gardens, N.Y., withdrew its generic version of Dyazide from the
market after admitting it had substituted the brandname drug for its
own in tests conducted as part of the FDA approval process.
   Besides Bolar and Vitarine, nine other generic drug makers are
under investigation by the FDA for suspicion of improprieties
ranging from mismanagement to fraud, including sample switching.
   An additional 20 generic drug companies are under scrutiny by the
agency, and the FDA is sampling all versions of the 30
most-prescribed generic drugs on the market.
   Recently, three former employees of the FDA's generic drug
division have pleaded guilty to charges that they accepted illegal
gratuities from drug makers.
   To win approval, generic drug makers must prove to the FDA that
their product has the same potency _ that it is absorbed into the
blood at a comparable rate _ as the brandname version.
   The FDA allows about 20 percent variability in potency, which
some doctors say can be a problem for some patients with certain
illnesses and conditions.
   This has been raised by a committee of the American Academy of
Family Physicians, which is recommending that the academy go on
record this month as opposing use of generic drugs in certain
patients, including those who are 75 years and older, and those with
diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, cardiac problems,
psychoses, depression and asthma.
   But Wolfe and other generic drug supporters say potency
variability is no greater than the variability seen in prescribed
dosages. Doctors usually prescribe the same dose of medication for a
125-pound adult as they do for a 250-pound adult, Wolfe said.
   The brandname manufacturers, which have been defending their
products against competing generics for years, have been silent for
the most part during the controversy.
   ``The research-based drug companies could not have purchased
better advertising questioning the merits of generic drugs than
they're getting right now,'' Nordmann said. ``They don't have to say
anything. They're looking at the generic industry shoot itself in
the foot.''
   Even though those mainstream companies emphasize developing new
drugs _ and winning exclusive marketing rights during a multi-year
patent period _ they also produce roughly three-fourths of all
generic drugs sold to remain competitive with the companies that
deal solely in generic drugs.

   Peering into the future and predicting where
the $5 trillion U.S. economy is headed has never been an easy job,
but it has gotten a lot tougher lately.
   Chagrined economists have watched in horror as the government
last month made revision after revision in data on past performance
that they use for coming up with their prognostications.
   The net result was that the U.S. economy was not nearly as weak
during the spring as first believed. Consumers spent at double the
pace first reported, employment growth was much stronger and the
overall economy, rather than limping along at an anemic annual
growth rate of 1.7 percent from April through June, actually grew at
a healthy 2.7 percent rate.
   As a consequence of all the revisions, the gloom-and-doom
forecasts of a month a go that a recession was imminent have been
tossed out the window. Replacing them is the new upbeat assessment
that the economy will continue cruising ahead at a healthy clip for
the rest of the year.
   While there are plenty of red faces accompanying the sudden
turn-about in forecasts, a lot more is at stake than the reputations
of high-paid analysts employed by major banks and investment houses.
   Government officials from the White House to the Federal Reserve
depend on accurate economic data in setting economic policy. Wrong
statistics can produce policies that throw tens of thousands of
people out of work needlessly or kick the economy into an
inflationary spiral.
   Many private economists say the problem lies in major budget
cutbacks in the statistic gathering agencies during the Reagan years.
   ``The problem with the statistics has gotten worse because they
don't have enough money to do a proper job,'' said Michael Evans,
who heads a Washington economic consulting firm. ``Some day, policy
mistakes based on bad statistics will end up sending the country
into a recession.''
   Some economists believe the country may face a resurgence of
inflation six months down the road because because of decisions that
the Federal Reserve made in June and July based on the bad
statistics.
   Viewing the extremely weak original reports on consumer spending
and employment growth, Fed policymakers decided to lower interest
rates to jumpstart a sluggish economy and avert a recession. The
revised data show that the economy, far from being sluggish, was
actually growing at a healthy rate last spring.
   ``I believe if the Fed knew then what they know now, they would
not have eased,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston
Co., an investment house. ``They helped to propel a basically strong
economy even more and thus they now run the risk of losing the
battle on inflation down the road.''
   Sinai and other economists worry that by spurring growth when a
stimulus wasn't really necessary, the Fed will end up making
inflationary pressures worse next year.
   They maintain that when prices start rising faster then, the Fed
will have to clamp down so hard on growth that it could topple the
country into the first economic downturn since the 1981-82 recession.
   The government's reports on factory orders and retail sales have
been notoriously unreliable at times in the past and analysts have
grown accustomed to looking at the figures with skepticism.
   What has economists most in a tizzy now is that the Labor
Department's monthly employment report _ generally considered one of
the most accurate economic measurements _ veered so far off the mark
earlier this year. Almost half the actual job growth in April, May
and June was missed in the original reports.
   Lois Plunkett, an official with the department's Bureau of Labor
Statistics, said three consecutive monthly revisions of such
magnitude is unusual. The average upward monthly revision in job
growth for the three months was just under 90,000, compared with
revisions averaging 47,000 jobs monthly over the past five years.
   ``We have been getting better over the years but we feel we could
improve further'' with additional resources, Ms. Plunkett said.
   Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, has
called the quality of government statistics a ``serious problem.''
And an interagency task force assigned to recommend changes is now
reviewing the situation.
   Former Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner, who was in charge
of many of the economic reports during the Reagan administration,
said the answer does not lie simply in providing more money to
collect and analyze the data.
   Some surveys that now rely on business providing data voluntarily
may have to be made mandatory to insure adequate responses, Ortner
said. For other reports the solution may be as simple as delaying
them a few more days while more data is gathered, he said.
   The Commerce Department did just that last year with its
merchandise trade reports after problems with collecting data
produced wildly unreliable figures on the nation's monthly trade
deficits.
   But Ortner failed in getting another report on new orders to
factories for durable goods delayed for one week in order to get
better information. When he suggested the idea, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan strongly objected, Ortner said.
   ``Greenspan wanted to have as much information as he could as
early as possible for the conduct of monetary policy,'' Ortner said.
``You always face the trade-off between timeliness and accuracy.''

<HEAD>Montgomery Ward Aims for Share of Clothing Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., which fought its way back
from collapse four years ago on the strength of electronics and
appliances, is preparing to battle for a share of the lucrative
retail clothing market.
   Next month, the Chicago-based retailer will unveil a new west
suburban store on the Niles-Skokie border containing what it hopes
will be a successful formula for men and women's casual and career
clothing.
   The push comes at a time when general retailers like Sears,
Roebuck and Co. see a downturn in consumer spending for durable
goods like refrigerators and color televisions, and are trying to
reclaim customers in the soft-goods arena.
   ``I think I can say for the first time since I've been here I
really have a high level of confidence that we are on the brink of a
strategic rollout of apparel,'' said Ward chairman Bernard Brennan
in a recent interview.
   ``I think where we are now is in a position where apparel can be
a very significant factor in our growth.''
   Brennan, who took Ward through a $3.8 billion leveraged buyout a
year ago, says Ward has little choice but to make the high-margin
clothing business a winner if the retailer wants to keep growing.
   ``Apparel may be 30 percent of (Ward's) business now, but it
drives in all the traffic. We're also reaching an economic period
where there's pressure on big-ticket merchandise, so if we're
accepted in apparel, we'll drive more traffic into the stores.''
   Much of the success of Ward's brand-name, low-price strategy has
been in such areas as Electric Avenue for electronics and
appliances, Home Ideas for home accessories, Gold 'N Gems for
jewelry, and Auto Express, its auto parts aftermarket business.
   Whatever growth Ward has seen in clothing has been in the Kid's
Store, the brand-name children's apparel concept launched last year.
   Now it's the grownups' turn. The effort has been an arduous one,
Brennan says. The company has been working for more than three years
to find the right mix of moderate goods and has gone through several
top executives over that time trying to accomplish its goal.
   The company's new apparel buying office now is run by Dan Levy,
former head of Home Ideas, who also was an executive at Gimbel's and
Kaufman's department stores.
   The casual clothing line for men and women will be similar to
merchandise sold at the Gap, where everything is coordinated by
color and fabric, Brennan says.
   And the company also will sell casual career clothing for men and
women, but no tailored suits or jackets. Ward will carry such brand
names as Gitano, Jordache, Von Furstenburg, Sag Harbor, Lee and
Wrangler, and add more over time.
   Brennan also said Ward will come out with a new private-label
brand ``very soon,'' bearing the name of a celebrity.
   Even with the revamp in apparel, Ward isn't straying from its
main customer base, families with household incomes varying from
$30,000 to $50,000 a year, men and women between the ages of 25 and
45.
   Ward also is in the midst of an aggressive expansion plan for its
department stores and free-standing specialty stores. The company
has said it expects to build four new full-line stores and 22 of its
specialty stores between this year and 1991.

   Stock prices opened slightly lower today, the
first day of trading following the long Labor Day weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 0.38 at
2,751.71 at 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Among broader market barometers, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues fell 0.17 to 196.20. On the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.11 to 383.85.
   Declining NYSE issues led advances slightly after the first 30
minutes of trading, with 519 down, 450 up and 485 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 19.86 million shares.
   Last week, the Dow average soared to new highs amid an upbeat
attitude about the nation's economy. Several reports showed
continued economic strength, including the August employment report,
which buoyed market sentiment.
   The news indicated that the economy isn't slowing as much as
expected, which has raised fears that the Federal Reserve may raise
interest rates instead of lowering them.
   On Friday, the Dow industrials rose 14.82 to a new high of
2,752.09, surpassing the previous peak of 2,743.36 reached a week
ago and bringing its gain for last week to 19.73 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones Friday by about 9 to
5, with 897 up, 498 down and 561 unchanged. Volume on the floor of
the Big Board came to 133.30 million shares, down from 143.42
million on Thursday.
   The nation's financial markets were closed on Monday for the
Labor Day holiday.

<HEAD>Profit Plunges, Saab Confirms Talks With Ford</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 5-7 to show stock exchange urged release of Saab
statement and trading of Saab shares.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reporting plunging profits in its
carmaking division, Sweden's Saab-Scania AB has confirmed it is in
negotiations with Ford Motor Co. about a possible collaboration.
   Reports have said that the automotive and aircraft giant may sell
a major stake in its carmaking operation to Ford. Ford has declined
to comment.
   Georg Karnsund, Saab's president and chief executive officer,
refused to disclose details of the talks Monday, saying Saab signed
an agreement of confidentiality with Ford.
   ``Discussions are taking place between the two companies. The
purpose of these discussions is to explore whether there are any
possibilities of closer cooperation in various areas of the
automotive business,'' Karnsund said in a statement cleared with
Ford.
   The statement, released at the urging of the Stockholm stock
exchange, said the talks were ``still at an early stage.''
   Karnsund said no further information would be released until the
talks were concluded. He said Saab also was talking with other
carmakers, but declined to identify them.
   Prices of Saab shares, meanwhile, rose slighly on the Stockholm
market Tuesday following Saab's announcement.
   Sales in the United States, once Saab's most profitable market,
dropped 15 percent in the first six months of the year, the company
said. The U.S. troubles dragged down the profit of the car division
by 30 percent to the equivalent of $139 million in the period, it
said.
   Karnsund said Saab needed to increase volume to overcome the
crisis, and ``this applies regardless of whether we go it alone or
start to collaborate with another car manufacturer.''
   The Saab-Scania group could carry the ailing car division, but
``we would achieve bigger volumes faster through collaboration with
a suitable partner,'' he said.
   A six-month report showed that despite setbacks in passenger
cars, Saab-Scania remained one of Sweden's most successful
companies, with sales of $3.5 billion, up 12 percent over the same
period in 1988.
   Its backlog of orders for commercial aircraft totaled $1.8
billion, compared with $1.2 billion this time last year, the report
said.
   Rumors have ciruclated for months that Saab might sell off its
problematic car division.
   A deal with Ford that includes the profitable Scania truck
division would give the American company a European foothold in
heavy vehicles to compete with General Motors Corp., which signed a
cooperation agreement two years ago with AB Volvo, Sweden's leading
automaker.
   Swedish newspapers reported last week that Saab was negotiating
to sell Ford a 20 percent to 40 percent share of the car division.
Ford reportedly was bidding for a majority share.
   Jan-Erik Larsson, head of the car division, said last week that
Saab ``will remain a Swedish automaking company,'' indicating that a
buyout was not being considered.
   Karnsund denied speculation that Saab might sell the division to
Volvo.
   The company president blamed declining U.S. sales on a slump in
the industry, making 1989 the worst year since 1981. Cars built to
U.S. specifications could not be diverted elsewhere when the market
sagged. He said about 3,000 unsold cars were sitting on U.S. lots.
   Karnsund also attributed the drop in profits to a steep rise in
costs, including a heavy investment in U.S. marketing.
   The company report said half-year sales by the car division rose
2.4 percent to $1.3 billion, despite a drop in the number of cars
sold to 58,700 from 61,400 worldwide.
   The group also is considering selling some of its component
plants and plans to cut up to 2,000 workers over two years.
Saab-Scania employs 50,653 after adding more than 600 this year,
Karnsund said.

<HEAD>OPEC Crude Production Increased Last Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC produced about 21.6 million barrels
a day of oil last month, up from a revised 21.4 million in July, the
International Energy Agency said today.
   In its Monthly Oil Market Report, the IEA said that most of the
excess production came from Iran.
   The latest estimate, one of the highest this year, exceeds the
19.5 million barrels a day that the cartel agreed to produce in the
last half of this year to keep output under control and prices firm.
OPEC had also decided in June on a target price of $18 a barrel.
   The Paris-based IEA also said that total world oil supplies grew
last month with production by Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development countries rising about 400,000 barrels.
   OECD oil output increased to 16.3 million barrels a day in August
from 15.9 million in July, the 21-member agency said. Developing
country production grew to 9.5 million from 9.4 million, it said.
   Despite promises to keep production in check, OPEC's supply has
remained strong and prices have slipped since last spring when they
reached their highs of the year.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC
registered $16.44 a barrel at the end of August. It topped the $18
mark last spring.
   Prices for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark brand,
have been running in the range of $18 to $19 a barrel. They had been
up to $24 a barrel in April.
   The International Energy Agency is an arm of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of Western nations,
including the United States, Japan, France, Britain and Germany.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Turn Mixed After Lower Opening</HEAD>

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with new export
demand offsetting the bearish implications of last week's good
growing weather in the Midwest.
   After a lower opening, the wheat market got a boost from
indications China bought 200,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat over the
weekend, an unexpected purchase.
   Corn and soybeans received early support from signs that Mexico
was in the market for U.S. corn and from forecasts for below-normal
temperatures next week in the Midwest.
   Fears of frost damage to the corn and soybean crops lingered in
the markets this morning, although prospects for a freeze in the
Corn Belt were considered dim.
   ``There was none over the weekend and there's not going to be any
this week,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``There's a chance for frost next week but
I wouldn't count on it.''
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 4 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.95 a bushel; corn was {
cent to 1 cent lower with September at $2.32\ a bushel; oats were }
cent lower to 2} cents higher with September at $1.36 a bushel;
soybeans were 4\ cents lower to { cent higher with September at
$5.81 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .10 cent to .55 cent lower with October
at 72.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .62 cent
lower with October at 81 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to
.73 cent lower with October at 39.45 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .42 cent to .70 cent lower with February at 43.45 cents
a pound.
   Livestock futures settled lower on Friday while pork bellies
advanced.

<HEAD>Two Big Accounting Firms Continuing Merger Discussions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Price Waterhouse
announced today that they plan to continue discussing a possible
merger, a move that could create the world's largest accounting firm.
   The two firms had hoped to reach a merger agreement by early this
month. On July 6, Chicago-based Andersen and New York-based Price
Waterhouse announced that they had entered into 60 days of formal
talks to explore the feasibility of a merger.
   In a statement released today, Price Waterhouse Chairman Joseph
E. Connor and Andersen Chief Executive Lawrence A. Weinbach said
``the initial period of discussion has been beneficial'' and the
``exploratory merger discussions are continuing.''
   They said partners at both firms' offices around the world were
participating in task forces to make recommendations on the proposed
merger.
   The executives said the discussions so far ``have concentrated on
exploring a combination that would add value to client service,
capitalize on shared values of commitment to quality ... and provide
enhanced opportunities to personnel of both firms.''
   But the statement said both firms would have no public comment on
details of the merger discussions because of confidentiality
agreements.
   Industry observers say the talks between Andersen and Price
Waterhouse have run into some obstacles, including how to deal with
Andersen's rapidly growing consulting business, the Chicago
Sun-Times reported in today's editions.
   But the firms apparently are resolved to deal with the problems
so as not to lag behind other major accounting firms which are
trying to complete mergers.
   ``A lot of Andersen consultants don't want to do it, but I think
it's going to go through anyway,'' said Arthur Bowman, publisher of
Bowman's Accounting Report in Atlanta.
   The merger of Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse is also ``not
just a U.S. issue, and that may be one of the reasons for the
slowness of the decision,'' Joel Portugal, a consultant who has
worked with both firms, told the New York Times.
   Another potential problem is IBM's relationship with both
Andersen and Price Waterhouse.
   IBM is Price Waterhouse's largest audit client, worth millions of
dollars in fees a year to the firm. The giant computer maker is also
involved in dozens of joint-venture partnerships with Andersen
Consulting to develop computer integration projects for clients.
   But federal Securities and Exchange Commission rules bar an
accounting firm from participating in joint ventures with audit
clients because of possible conflicts of interest.
   ``If they move forward, there's the potential something big could
be lost,'' James Emerson, publisher of Emerson's Professional
Service Review in Bellevue, Wash., told the Sun-Times.

<HEAD>Grand Met Sells Bookmaking Units To Brent Walker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC said Tuesday it has signed
an agreement to sell its interests in the William Hill and Mecca
betting shops to Brent Walker PLC for 685 million pounds, or about
$1.06 billion.
   The agreement, which had been widely anticipated, is subject to
approval by shareholders of Brent Walker, a British leisure industry
company, and cleared by Britain's Office of Fair Trading.
   The sale of the betting shops is part of a corporate
restructuring at Grand Metropolitan, a giant British food and liquor
group which is aiming to focus its core businesses and reduce its
high level of debt after its $5.8 billion acquisition of the
Minneapolis-based foodmaker Pillsbury Co. last January.
   Brent Walker, a British leisure and drinks concern, said it would
pay 685 million pounds in cash for the William Hill and Mecca
bookmaking businesses, and the deal is expected to be completed by
Oct. 17.
   Brent Walker said it will form a new company named The William
Hill Group Ltd, which will be owned by the banks financing the
purchase.
   ``The acquisition represents a major strategic opportunity for
Brent Walker,'' said the company's chairman George Walker, who said
the combined group will be the second-largest in the U.K., after
Ladbroke Group PLC.
   In a separate move, Grand Metropolitan said it is negotiating to
sell its Irish bookmaker shops and another 45 bookmaker shops in the
London area to meet the requirements of Britain's Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose sharply against most major
currencies in European trading Tuesday despite reports of
central-bank intervention.
   Gold prices declined.
   Foreign-exchange dealers said the dollar rose on confidence that
U.S. interest rates would remain firm for some time and could even
move higher.
   After the Bank of Japan intervened against the dollar's rise, 11
other central banks sold dollars for West German marks or their own
currencies. But their effort was almost fruitless.
   Some dealers said the dollar could rise to 2 West German marks
this week, a level it last reached on June 15.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 146.65 Japanese yen, up from 146.13. In London
the dollar closed higher at 147.00 yen.
   One British pound cost $1.5385 late Tuesday in London, cheaper
than $1.5532 Monday.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Monday's
late rates: 1.9895 West German marks, up from 1.9780; 1.7170 Swiss
francs, up from 1.7085; 6.7055 French francs, up from 6.6725; 2.2415
Dutch guilders, up from 2.2282; 1.1811 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1815; and 1,425.50 Italian lire, up from 1,417.50.
   Gold bullion closed in London at $358.25 a troy ounce, down from
$359 late Monday. The late Zurich bid price was $358.30 an ounce,
off 70 cents.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $359.35 an ounce, up from
$358.45.
   Silver bullion rose in London to $5.07 a troy ounce, up from
$5.05.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
country jumped by 27 to 936 last week, fueled by double-digit
increases in Texas and Oklahoma, a widely-followed index of drilling
activity said Tuesday.
   A year ago, the count stood at 933. The index had risen by six
the previous week and by 45 two weeks earlier.
   The Baker Hughes rig count reflects the number of rigs actively
exploring for oil as of last Friday, but not those actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Texas, which dropped by 14 a week ago, showed a 20-rig gain in
the most recent count, while Oklahoma was up by 16.
   Among other major oil producing states, Colorado and Wyoming each
were up by three, while Kansas increased by two. Louisiana lost 11
rigs, while California, New Mexico and North Dakota each were down
by two and Ohio and Pennsylvania each dropped one. Michigan was
unchanged.

   The government announced Tuesday that
the pace of growth in the Philippine economy slowed during the first
half of the year as prices continued to rise.
   The government's National Statistical Coordinating Board made the
announcement in a report submitted to President Corazon Aquino.
   The Board said the gross national product, which measures the
value of goods and services, grew 5.33 percent during the first six
months of this year, down from the 6.54 percent rate during the same
period in 1988.
   The government had predicted the economy would grow at an average
of 6.5 percent this year.
   The Board also said prices of good and services in August rose
11.7 percent, higher than the 10.3 percent rise in July.

<TEXT>
   Fewer U.S. companies plan to increase hiring in
the final quarter of 1989 than the previous year, due largely to
softness in the Northeast, a survey of U.S. firms released Tuesday
found.
   The survey, conducted by Manpower Inc., a temporary employment
agency, found that 26 percent of nearly 14,000 employers questioned
by telephone planned to increase hiring from October through
December, down from 28 percent in 1988.
   Companies located in the Northeast had the least ambitious hiring
plans, with 22 percent saying they would add to their staff, a
seven-year low, vs. 27 percent last year.
   Nationally, 9 percent of the firms surveyed planned staff
reductions, compared with 8 percent last year. In the Northeast, 11
percent said they would cut staff, up from 8 percent in 1988.
   Manpower President Mitchell S. Fromstein said the softness in the
Northeast was particularly evident in the manufacturing sectors,
where hiring plans were substantially below those of other regions.
   Overall, retailers had the most optimistic hiring plans,
reflecting the upcoming lucrative holiday season, Fromstein said.
   On Friday, the Labor Department reported that August unemployment
held steady at 5.2 percent with the creation of more than 200,000
non-farm jobs, excluding the effects of phone strikes.
   The respondents to Manpower's quarterly survey included private
companies and government agencies in 437 cities.

   Wheat futures prices posted solid gains Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to improved foreign demand
for U.S. wheat while corn and soybean futures prices retreated in
lackluster trading.
   The wheat market was supported by last week's sale of 200,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat to China and indications the Chinese may
have purchased another large shipment over the weekend, analysts
said.
   The Agriculture Department reported after the close that it had
inspected 37.2 million bushels of wheat for export last week
compared to 28 million a year ago.
   A lower-than-expected Canadian wheat-crop estimate also prompted
buying of U.S. wheat futures. Canadian authorities estimated
Canada's spring wheat crop at 23.4 million bushels, slightly below
the USDA's August projection of 24 million bushels.
   The USDA will issue new crop projections Sept. 12

<TEXT>
   OPEC nations widened their oil taps a
bit more in August to boost their crude production to one of the
highest levels so far this year, according to estimates released
Tuesday.
   The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil Market
Report that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped
about 21.6 million barrels of oil a day last month _ up 200,000
barrels from a revised July figure of 21.4 million and 2.6 million
barrels a day higher than last year.
   The IEA estimate also is about 2 million barrels more than the
19.5 million-barrel ceiling set by OPEC when it met in June.
   Other sources have put OPEC's August production at between 21.5
million and 21.7 million barrels. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a
respected trade newsletter, estimated OPEC's July output at 21.8
million barrels.
   Too much oil last year led to a price drop of more than $5 in WTI
from $18.52 on April 18, 1988, to the year's low of $12.60 on Oct.
5. While higher demand has kept prices from falling as dramatically
this year, prices have weakened and analysts say they could continue
to do so before they recover.
   By October, consumers could see a slight decline in retail
gasoline prices _ about 2 cents to 3 cents, said William Veno,
director of oil market analysis for Data Resources Inc.
   ``The majority of the higher output came from Iran, which had
experienced a decline in July,'' the IEA report said.
   The 13 OPEC nations agreed in June to try to keep output under
control and prices near a target of $18 a barrel. But despite the
promises, the cartel's supply has remained strong, depressing prices
from their highs of last spring.
   The average price of a basket of the seven OPEC-monitored crudes
registered $16.44 a barrel at the end of August, compared with $18
last spring.
   Prices for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark brand,
have been running in the range of $18 to $19 a barrel, but other
U.S. crudes have been weaker. WTI, which a growing number of
analysts say does not represent the market, had been up to $24 a
barrel in April.
   Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in
New York, said OPEC's production seems to have stabilized. ``They've
kind of found their level and the market is pretty much absorbing
it,'' he said.
   Higher demand this year _ about 1 million barrels a day more _ is
one reason prices haven't fallen further, Veno said.
   Moreover, lower U.S. production and oil rig accidents in the
North Sea and elsewhere have lowered world oil output and enabled
OPEC to pump more oil without serious repercussions, said Veno.
   ``In order for them not to undermine prices further and
precipitate a collapse, OPEC will have to hold production at about
21.6 million barrels,'' Veno said. While fourth-quarter demand is
expected to grow, North Sea and other non-OPEC production also is
expected to grow as repairs are completed, he said.
   An OPEC monitoring panel will meet in Geneva, Switzerland, on
Sept. 23 to analyze the market and decide whether to raise the
supply cap to around 20 million barrels a day in the last quarter of
the year.
   The United Arab Emirates produced 1.8 million barrels a day in
August, well above its OPEC-set ceiling of about a million barrels,
the IEA reported.
   Kuwait's output last month was estimated at 1.6 million barrels a
day, up from its target of a million barrels.
   Nigeria pumped about 1.8 million barrels a day last month, higher
than its 1.4 million-barrel quota.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, produced 4.8
million barrels a day, about the same as its target.
   Iran and Iraq both pumped at their quota levels of 2.8 million
barrels a day, according to the report.
   The report noted that Iraq was nearing completion of a pipeline
through Saudi Arabia that would increase its capacity to export oil
to about 3 million barrels a day.
   The output of other cartel members in August was at or near their
targets:
   Indonesia, 1.2 million barrels a day; Venezuela, 1.7 million
barrels; Algeria, 700,000 barrels; Ecuador, 300,000 barrels; Libya,
1.1 million barrels; Qatar, 400,000 barrels; and Gabon, 200,000
barrels.
   The Paris-based IEA is an arm of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, made up of Western nations, including
the United States, Japan, France, Britain and Germany.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Tuesday's auction to the lowest level in several
weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.88 percent, down from 7.94 percent
last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.87 percent, down from 7.88 percent last

   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.65
percent on July 31 and six-month bills averaged 7.85 percent on Aug
21.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.15 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,800.80 and 8.31 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,602.10.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the

for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.32
percent last week, down from 8.36 percent the previous week.

   ``Once Upon a Time in America'' was one
of the first movies a new European network showed when it went on
the air this year.
   In fact, American shows are increasingly what the 320 million
viewers in the 12 nations of the European Economic Community see
almost every time they turn on their television sets.
   Be it the original ``Batman'' series, the ``Odd Couple,'' ``Star
Trek'' or ``Dallas,'' U.S. programs pervade the airwaves and
European politicians and artists are rallying against them.
   After years of waffling, the EEC member nations will try to
decide in October whether to stem the flood of U.S. programming
through quotas.
   The United States is crying foul, complaining about protectionism
and fearing a loss of millions of dollars in trade.
   But defenders of quotas here say European culture is at stake,
calling for protection as the EEC prepares turn the community into a
single trading bloc by the end of 1992.
   Writing to key members of the EEC-affiliated European Parliament
recently, Carla Hills, the special U.S. trade representative, said
quotas would be ``blatantly discriminatory, patently unjustifiable,
and would almost certainly have a disastrous effect on the U.S.
industry's substantial European earnings.''
   Experts said more homegrown productions may not improve the
overall quality of European television and doubted whether Europe
can produce enough to replace U.S. shows kept out by quotas.
   This decade, many European nations deregulated their television
industries, more than doubling air time, which could be filled only
with more U.S. programs.
   As early as 1982, Culture Minister Jack Lang of France called for
``a real crusade against _ let's call things by their name _ this
financial and intellectual imperialism that no longer grabs
territory, or rarely, but grabs consciousness, ways of thinking,
ways of living.''
   He said he counted more than 200 hours of American shows in one
week on the six French channels.
   Last year, on Belgium's RTL-TVi, a commercial network, 65 percent
of the movies, 83 percent of the series and 70 percent of the
cartoons were American-made, according to parliamentary records.
   Quotas would hit the U.S. television industry hard as it is
increasingly using international sales to offset huge production
costs.
   George Gerbner of the Annenberg School of Communications in
Philadelphia said in an interview that U.S. producers had ``only
three major buyers in the United States,'' meaning the three big
networks.
   ``And they put the price so low that the domestic market only
takes care of the cost. For a profit they are forced onto the world
market. So there is a strong drive to get into as many markets as
possible.''
   A decade ago, the Western European market for U.S. television
consisted of only a handful of state networks, but more stations
have since gone on the air and the competition for top shows has
driven prices up.
   Lorimar Telepictures Corp., which produces ``Dallas,'' has been
seeing its international revenues rise by about 25 percent annually.
The series, which sold for $12,000 an episode in 1986, yielded four
times as much in 1988.
   Today, Walt Disney Studios gets more than half its overseas
television revenue from EEC countries. The community's business for
U.S. producers swelled to more than $650 million last year from $100
million in 1980.
   The European public continues to gobble up American TV with great
cheer, despite pleas that they should not yield to ``cultural
imperialism.''
   But American programs gave been on European TV screens for a long
time, chiefly because there was little else to chose from.
   As long ago as the 1950s ``there was a void in TV schedules and
only the U.S. producers could work on such a massive scale,'' said
Professor Cees Hamelink of the International Association of Mass
Communication Research in The Hague, Netherlands.
   The process was self-fulfilling. Larry Gross, also of the
Annenberg School, said U.S. television forces audiences to expect a
level of production that Europeans can't match.
   ``To meet them, you have to join them,'' he said in an interview.
   Western Europe's new commercial networks do just that. It is
cheaper to show reruns of ``Taxi,'' ``Alf,'' ``Benson'' and
``Hogan's Heroes'' than to make their own programs or buy more
expensive European series. In any case, major European series are
not likely to be available in sufficient quantities for some time.

   Discussing possible EEC quotas, Jack Valenti, President of the
Motion Picture Association of America, raised the question at a
congressional hearing in Washington earlier this year whether
European producers can ever satisfy European viewers' demands after
so much American television.
   Yet the EEC is moving ahead with plans to protect European
television.
   If not, said Jacques Delors, president of the EEC Commission,
``all televisions will be made in Japan and all programs will be
American.''
   As early as 1984, the EEC suggested a local-content quota of 60
percent. This year, this was watered down to a majority of European
programs ``where practicable.''
   But the European Parliament wanted precise figures and that has
led to a stalemate. The EEC nations will reopen the debate in
October.
   Meanwhile, U.S. television remains a political issue for the left
and, more recently, the extreme right.
   Franz Schoenhuber, leader of the West German Republicans, rang
the theme during election campaigns this year, assailing ``Dallas''
and other U.S. shows on West German television.
   ``We don't want the American way of life,'' he said.
   The French film director Claude Autant-Lara, reflecting the views
of many of his European colleagues, talked about the ``terrifying''
threat to European culture from across the Atlantic.
   Comparing the best in Europe's cultural heritage with American
mass consumerism, Claude Brule, president of France's Union of
Playwrights and Composers, begged Europeans ``not to turn the
grandchildren of Moliere into those of Coca-Cola.''
   ``The Americans are seen as crude and rude and it is a continuing
process,'' said Gross of the Annenberg School.
   ``It is a defensible argument to impose quotas on other cultures,
but the context and the reason have to be different than to think
domestic is good and foreign is bad.''
   The culture split can even get blurred.
   ``Once Upon a Time in America,'' which the Belgian commercial
station VTM showed on its opening weekend last winter, is a U.S.
movie, featuring lots of blood and gore. However, it was directed by
Sergio Leone, an Italian.
   Not all U.S. television gets a bad rap in Europe. Nor does ``Made
in Europe'' guarantee unrivaled quality.
   ``On the day that the British and the continental Europeans can
make programs as good as `Hill Street Blues' they may be in a
position to talk about holding back American cultural imperialism,''
wrote TV critic Christopher Dunkley in Britain's Financial Times
early this year.
   Europeans have produced such successful programs as the British
series ``Jewel in the Crown'' and ``Brideshead Revisited'' and the
quality West German production ``Berlin Alexanderplatz.''
   But they are not the norm.
   Italy's 250 or so mostly local stations lure viewers with endless
jewelry sales, game shows, beauty contests and entertainment
programs where culture is as sparse as clothing.
   Some experts see no European television style, merely a spinoff
of the U.S. style. They point to ``Chateauvallon,'' a French series
titled after a fictive town, or West Germany's ``Das Erbe des
Guldenburgs'' (The Guldenburg Inheritance), which match the family
feuds and romantic escapades of ``Dallas.''
   They doubt whether quotas can change this, since local programs
would have to be mass produced to meet the new demand.
   ``Only the European media giants stand to win when quotas are
introduced,'' said Jean Claude Burgelman, director of Brussels'
Center for the Study of New Media and Information Technology.
   These winners could be Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, the West German
Leo Kirch and Britain's Robert Maxwell, he said in an interview.
``And they have no history of producing television art,'' Burgelman
added.
   ``They will want to make heaps of money and will produce works
for the largest common denominator,'' said Hamelink of The Hague
research group. ``You will get the typical series you get in the
United States: a bit of violence, a bit of mild sex.''
   Said Burgelman: ``Instead of American pulp we will have European
pulp.''

<HEAD>Occidental Oil &amp; Gas Announces 900 Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Oil &amp; Gas Corp. will eliminate 900
jobs, or about 20 percent of its domestic work force, as part of a
move to save $100 million a year, company officials announced
Tuesday.
   ``This restructuring recognizes a need to simplify and streamline
domestic oil and gas operations while at the same time generating
additional cash to sustain or improve capital programs for
exploration and development,'' said David Hentschel, chairman and
chief executive.
   Hentschel announced the layoffs on the public address system at
the company's headquarters in Tulsa just before noon, employees said.
   Verle McCoy, manager of financial accounting for Occidental, said
employees had been hearing layoff rumors since May.
   Occidental employs about 9,000 people worldwide, including 4,500
in the United States. About 650 to 700 of the jobs being eliminated
are in Tulsa.
   The company is closing its exploration operations in Tulsa as
part of a plan to restructure domestic oil and gas operations, said
Linda Hauser, spokeswoman for the company.
   The company hopes the reorganization will save $100 million a
year, she said.
   Occidental Oil &amp; Gas Corp., including Oxy USA, is a subsidiary of
Occidental Petroleum Corp. based in Los Angeles.
   The layoffs will occur over the next few months and into 1990,
Ms. Hauser said. She said there also will be an unspecified number
of relocations and transfers.
   A voluntary retirement program also will be offered to eligible
employees who are 55 years old or older and have five years of
service. Employees will have until Oct. 5 to decide whether to
participate in the retirement program.
   The company's oil processing and oil and gas production
operations will be combined into the new regional offices in
Oklahoma City, Midland and Houston, Ms. Hauser said. All domestic
and international oil exploration activities will be transferred to
central offices in Bakersfield, Calif.
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. acquired the then Cities Service Oil &amp;
Gas Corp. for $4 billion in 1982 and recently renamed the unit Oxy
USA Inc.

<HEAD>Medical Benefits for Retirees Stir Accounting Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the credit-rating
agency, said Tuesday that a proposed accounting rule for retirees'
medical benefits would be prone to large errors and distort
companies' balance sheets.
   The proposed rule would make companies face up to reality by
listing the future cost of retirees' medical benefits as a liability
on their books.
   Rough estimates of the new liabilities range from $400 billion to
$2 trillion for all U.S. companies.
   ``It's not the concept that's the problem so much as as the
implementation,'' Solomon Samson, a Standard &amp; Poor's managing
director, said in an interview. ``You may be doing yourself more of
a disservice, even though the objective is very noble.''
   Samson said Standard &amp; Poor's would stick to its own method of
estimating how retirees' medical expenses would affect
creditworthiness.
   Companies that promised generous medical benefits to employees
upon retirement are seeking changes in the accounting proposal,
which would force firms to slash their reported profits by billions
of dollars.
   Standard &amp; Poor's criticism, which first surfaced in a Wall
Street Journal story Tuesday, was the severest yet in the ongoing
debate.
   Officials at Ford Motor Co. and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. said Tuesday in phone interviews that they support the change in
principle, while believing it is too stringent as proposed.
   Listing future medical benefits as a liability will sting all
companies, but especially ones that gave their employees better
retirement medical benefits because it seemed cheaper in the short
run than paying higher wages and salaries.
   Hardest hit will be smokestack industries such as automakers and
steelmakers that have generous benefits packages and growing ranks
of retirees, combined with slow growth or no growth in revenue.
   The benefits issue is much like the national debate over Social
Security and how to account for the cost of supporting the baby boom
generation when it reaches retirement.
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the chief rule-making
body for accountants, is taking companies' suggestions into account
and probably will relax the rule somewhat before adoption, Timothy
Lucas, research director of the Norwalk, Conn.-based organization,
said Tuesday.
   By accounting rules, whenever companies add a new liability for a
future expense, they have to reduce their reported profits by an
equal amount. If the charge were taken all at once or over a short
period, it could turn a profit into a large reported loss, alarming
shareholders.
   ``This liability was built up over past years and under prior
management teams, and some people have the feeling that, `Why does
this have to happen on my watch?''' Lucas said.
   Still, Standard &amp; Poor's reported criticism was ``very unusual,''
since most other companies have at least supported the concept of
the change, he said.
   Moody's Investors Service, the main rival to Standard &amp; Poor's,
said the proposed rule would help rating agencies by providing them
with more complete information about companies' liabilities.
   ``We feel that it is a positive to both rating agencies and
investors. The logic of accruing a future liability has validity,''
said Harold Goldberg, a Moody's senior vice president.
   The debate over accounting rules does not even touch on an even
bigger issue, which is whether companies should set up funds for
retirees' medical benefits the same way they set up pension funds.
Tax laws discourage such funds because money put into them can't be
deducted from corporate income taxes the way pension contributions
can.
   The proposed accounting standard would go into effect in 1992 and
companies would have 15 years to bring their books into line with
their actual liabilities.
   Companies have proposed several ways to ease the blow. One is to
stretch the catch-up period to 20, 30 or even 40 years. Another is
to let companies account for liabilities that have already been
incurred by going back and restating earnings for prior years
instead of taking the full blow in current and future earnings
statements.
   An alternative would be to add to liabilities without taking a
corresponding hit on the profit-and-loss statement _ an unusual and
controversial approach.
   Some companies, including Ford, want leeway to assume that they
will be able to reduce inflation in medical benefits costs below
historical levels _ something not permitted under the proposed
standard.
   Finally, some companies have proposed easing the blow by making
the assumption that employees will not retire until they reach
mandatory retirement age. That would allow more years to accumulate
the reserve and assume fewer years of payouts.

   The dollar gained sharply against most foreign
currencies in active trading Tuesday despite a reported wave of
selling by central banks.
   Gold prices softened. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery settled at $359.60 a troy ounce, down
$1 from Friday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid
for gold of $358.60 an ounce, off 65 cents from Friday.
   U.S. financial markets were closed Monday for the Labor Day
holiday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar started out strong on continued
confidence that U.S. interest rates would remain firm and could even
move higher. But the dollar ended off its highs of the day largely
due to profit-taking, they said.
   ``There's some pretty good demand out there,'' said Robert Ryan,
a senior trader for Irving Trust Co. ``The market likes the dollar
but it thinks it's slightly overbought.''
   Traders said the market had little reaction to reported efforts
by about a dozen major central banks to drive down the dollar's
value, including the Federal Reserve, which was said to have
intervened three times.
   A recent chain of positive economic data has helped support the
dollar by making U.S. securities more attractive to foreign
investors, thereby increasing the need to convert overseas
currencies into dollars.
   Some dealers say the dollar is poised to move higher because the
economy's apparent strength might prompt the Fed to raise interest
rates to quell inflationary pressures.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 146.65 Japanese yen, up from 146.13. It closed
at 147.00 yen in London, and 146.75 yen in New York, up from 145.945.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound. Each pound
cost $1.5385 late Tuesday in London, cheaper than $1.5532 Monday.
Sterling fetched $1.5385 in New York, down from $1.55325 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.9875 West German marks, up from 1.9780; 1.7150
Swiss francs, up from 1.7085; 6.7000 French francs, up from 6.6725;
1.18065 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1815; and 1,424.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,417.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday's late rates
included: 1.9895 West German marks, up from 1.9780; 1.7170 Swiss
francs, up from 1.7085; 6.7055 French francs, up from 6.6725; 2.2415
Dutch guilders, up from 2.2282; 1.1811 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1815; and 1,425.50 Italian lire, up from 1,417.50.
   Gold bullion closed in London at $358.25 an ounce, down from $359
Monday. The late Zurich bid was $358.30 an ounce, off 70 cents.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed up 90 cents at $359.35 an
ounce.
   Silver prices turned mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.063 a troy ounce, down from
$5.076 Friday. Silver rose in London to $5.07 an ounce from $5.05.

   Energy futures prices rose Tuesday, paced by an
advance in wholesale home heating oil and gasoline.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for October
delivery of No.2 heating oil gained 0.60 cent to 54.57 cents a
gallon. Contracts for more distant months posted similar increases.
The October contract had fallen 0.31 cent on Friday, the previous
trading session.
   Unleaded gasoline for October delivery moved 0.44 cent higher to
53.76 cents a gallon after falling 0.21 cent Friday. The November,
December and January contracts also rose.
   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $19.05 per 42-gallon barrel, up
20 cents from Friday, when the contract added 2 cents. Other
delivery months also increased.
   Prices for refined petroleum products benefited from projections
of a pickup in worldwide demand and expectations of a temporary drop
in supply, which normally occurs at the beginning of autumn when
refiners shift part of their capacity to output of heating oil from
gasoline, analysts said.
   Andrew Lebow at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc. said the
energy market was generally quiet, with crude taking a cue from the
products.
   ``While the crude fundamentals don't look as promising as for the
products ... there is some reluctance to sell the market off in the
face of strong product demand,'' Lebow said.

<HEAD>Airborne Invasion: Foreign Carriers Snapping Up Pieces of U.S. Rivals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like modern-day conquistadors, foreign airlines
are descending on the New World to buy up pieces of U.S. carriers.
   Major U.S. airlines have become hot properties, stalked by
big-time investors, unions and rival carriers. Foreign airlines are
keen to get in on the action, and the Americans are eager to get the
infusions of capital from abroad.
   More importantly, though, the foreigners are taking equity stakes
in order to help them gain access to the booming U.S. air travel
market, which can augment their passenger traffic.
   Foreign airlines aren't allowed under U.S. law to own domestic
airlines or carry passengers within the United States, so many are
linking up with American partners in special marketing agreements.
As big stockholders, the foreigners can exert even more influence on
the strategies of U.S. carriers.
   ``They're using it to get a toehold in the U.S. market,'' said
Andrew Geller, an airline analyst at Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia.
   British Airways, Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, Swissair, Japan Air Lines and Australia's Ansett Transport
Industries Ltd. all have snapped up, or are seeking, equity stakes
in U.S. carriers.
   The attraction is especially strong for European airlines, which
have been seeking ways of positioning themselves to exploit the era
of Common Market deregulation that is set to begin in 1992.
   SAS, the first foreign carrier to buy a stake in a U.S. major,
signed a $50 million cooperation agreement with Texas Air Corp. last
October and holds 9.9 percent of the Houston-based company. SAS
recently has been in talks to buy a stake in struggling Continental
Airlines, one of Texas Air's main subsidiaries.
   ``We had a very limited number of U.S. gateways,'' said Nils Flo,
an SAS spokesman in New York, explaining why the airline entered the
agreement that gave it a ``feeder'' network in the United States.
   A new pilots-and-management proposal to buy United Airlines
parent UAL Corp. for $6.75 billion would include a 15 percent share
for British Airways, which has agreed in principal to invest $750
million. Speculation was rife Tuesday that billionaire oilman Marvin
Davis, who previously made a lower bid, may seek help from another
foreign airline to top the group's offer.
   British Airways' role in the UAL bid is similar to that played by
KLM, which is the foreign partner in the investor group that
recently paid $3.65 billion for Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc.
in a leveraged buyout.
   Under U.S. law, foreign airlines may not own more than 25 percent
of a domestic carrier, and the Department of Transportation can
object to smaller stakes if it believes the foreign company is
trying to exert control.
   Assistant Transportation Secretary Jeffrey N. Shane said last
week that the department is reluctant to approve such foreign
purchases, partly because there still are many questions about U.S.
airlines' access to European markets after the Common Market's
planned unification in 1992.
   UAL and British Airways, two of the biggest airlines, started
with a marketing agreement back in December 1987 that includes
sharing airport facilities and coordinating schedules.
   A British Airways passenger in London, for example, can book a
flight through to Chicago on one ticket; the British airline would
take him from London to New York, where he could connect to United
for the second leg.
   The venture has been so successful it has increased both
airlines' passenger traffic by around 30 percent, according to Sir
Colin Marshall, British Airways' chief executive officer.
   British Airways ``has methodically extended its presence in
several bold strokes that should improve the company's
already-potent position as international airline markets are
gradually deregulated,'' Michael Armellino and Glenn Engel, analysts
for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., wrote in a report.
   Another international alliance was struck mainly for defensive
reasons, rather than expansive designs. Delta Air Lines, fearing it
could be a takeover target, recently agreed to sell a 5 percent
share to Swissair. The two also have a marketing agreement, signed
earlier.
   Lufthansa German Airlines disclosed Friday that it is in talks
with AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, about a possible stake
in American's Sabre computer reservations system.
   Ansett, an Australian conglomerate owned 50-50 by media tycoon
Rupert Murdoch and transportation company TNT Ltd., in August 1987
bought a 20 percent stake in America West Airlines, an aggressive
regional carrier. The two do not have a cooperative agreement, but
America West leases and purchases some of its aircraft from Ansett.
   ``We have a lot in common,'' said Daphne Dicino, an America West
spokeswoman in Tempe, Ariz. ``Basically it's a very positive
experience.''
   HAL Inc., the parent of Hawaiian Airlines, is about 20 percent
owned by Japan Air Lines. A subsidiary of the Japanese carrier plans
to build several hotels in the Hawaiian islands.
   Last week, HAL signed a definitive agreement for its sale for
around $22 million to an investment group that includes former
baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc., seeking to restore customer
confidence and boost sales after a devastating loss and management
shake-up, unveiled a new line of four IBM-compatible personal
computers Tuesday.
   Analysts said the PCs, including one using International Business
Machine Corp.'s Micro Channel architecture, were priced to compete
with IBM, Compaq Computer Inc. and other manufacturers of integrated
office systems for large corporate customers.
   ``This should allow Wang to move out inventory and turn it into
cash to reduce debt, which is the first thing they've got to do _
get their balance sheet cleaned up,'' said Fred Pastore, a high
technology analyst at Moody's Investors Service in New York.
   Wang reported a $424 million loss for the fiscal year that ended
June 30 and has announced plans to eliminate 2,200 of its 30,000
employees by the end of this month. It recently reshuffled its top
management, naming Richard Miller to succeed Frederick A. Wang, son
of founder and chairman An Wang, as president.
   The Lowell-based company was a leader in word processing
equipment in the 1970s but was criticized in the early 1980s for
sticking with its proprietary systems instead of moving quickly into
IBM-compatible machines. In recent years, its sales of minicomputers
have been hurt by competition from more and more powerful PCs and
workstations.
   Pastore said the introduction of the new PCs was intended to
restore customer confidence by signaling Wang's commitment to
``follow established standards rather than trying to go its own
route and do its own thing.''
   But because of its financial position, he added, the best the
company can realistically hope for is to retain its existing
customers. ``We don't expect them to get much new business,''
Pastore said.
   Wang's worldwide marketing manager, Daniel H. Miley, disagreed.
He said the company believes the machines will attract new customers
by providing ``higher performance, greater capability, at a better
price'' than their competitors and offering ``a long-term ability to
run off-the-shelf, industry-standard software.''
   ``There's a move in the industry toward open standards, and we
are clearly supporting that move with this announcement,'' Miley
added.
   The new machines, manufactured in Lowell, Taiwan and Limerick,
Ireland, include the model PC 350-16S, a desktop based on the 386 SX
microprocessor from Intel Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif. It carries a
list price of $2,695, about $600 less than a comparable model from
Houston-based Compaq, the leading maker of IBM compatibles.
   Wang also introduced the model MC 350@16S, combining a 386 SX
chip with Micro Channel architecture, at $2,995. Micro Channel,
which Wang has licensed from IBM, speeds the transfer of data
between the computer's memory and central processor.
   Wang also unveiled two PCs based on popular 80286 chips, the PC
250-16 at $2,095 and the PC 280-20 at $2,995. The later can be used
as an inexpensive local area network server, linking multiple
machines.

   The stock market declined Tuesday in quiet
post-holiday trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 7.41 to
2,744.68, still the second highest close ever behind the record high
of 2,752.09 set Friday. The market was closed Monday in observance
of Labor Day.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
826 down, 618 up and 528 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 145.18 million
shares, up from 130.30 million in Friday's session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 175.46 million shares.
   Analysts said there was little activity as many traders did not
return from the long Labor Day weekend. Some program trading and a
selloff to gain profits sent stocks lower after an up-and-down
morning session, traders said.
   Takeover-related buying in the airline and hotel sectors
attracted the most interest, sending prices up there. The Dow
transportation index climbed 5.69 to 1,532.01, another new high.
   ``Takeover names and transportation continue to be the only
things that get any play,'' said Thomas R. Walsh, head of equity
trading for Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   UAL, parent of United Airlines, rose 3} to 290} amid speculation
that investor Marvin Davis would top a management-led buyout offer
of $300 a share. Other potential takeover targets in the industry
also moved higher. AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained { to 90\
and Delta rose 1] to 81].
   Among hotel stocks, Holiday Corp., owner of Holiday Inn, gained
1] to 81] in reaction to rumors the company turned down a takeover
offer valued at $105 a share. Hilton Hotels, which recently put
itself up for sale, gained 2| to 108}.
   Oil stocks were mostly higher. Mobil was up { to 55|, Chevron
increased ~ to 57~, Arco gained | to 105\. Amoco fell [ to 48\ and
Exxon was down [ to 43~.
   Philip Morris was a leading issue among blue chips, rising 2] to

27.
   Losers on the day included Teledyne, down 3} to 372, Coca Cola,

which fell 1] to 51}, Honeywell, down 1\ to 87}, and Cray Research,
off 1[ to 43.
   Ford, which is holding talks with the Swedish automaker and
aerospace company Saab-Scania, lost | at 53|.
   Last week, the Dow average soared on a wave of optimism about the
nation's economy. Several reports showed continued economic
strength, including the August employment report that buoyed market
sentiment.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market on Tuesday lost $6.79 billion, or
0.20 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.53 to 195.84.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index declined 1.17 to 404.10 and

<TEXT>
   In a booklet sent to BAT Industries PLC
shareholders, hostile raider Sir James Goldsmith has accused the
company's board of attempting to frustrate the $21.6 billion
takeover bid, a published report Tuesday said.
   The Financial Times reported that the 23-page booklet from
Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments Ltd. consortium also attacked the
performance of BAT, a tobacco, retailing and insurance concern.
   Securities and Exchange Commission regulations prohibit Hoylake
from promoting its bid in the United States so the full text of the
booklet was not made available to American journalists.
   BAT shareholders received documents in the mail Tuesday from both
sides in the takeover battle.
   Hoylake sent its booklet on Saturday. BAT on Sunday responded by
describing the Hoylake document as ``highly selective and
misleading.''
   Hoylake has accused BAT of trying to frustrate the offer in U.S.
courts. In its latest document, BAT countered the criticism by
quoting statements made by U.S. officials, including California
Attorney General John Van de Kamp, that support BAT's position.
   ``Goldsmith has tried repeatedly to uncover evidence that BAT has
not performed for shareholders,'' the statement said. ``No feats of
statistical manipulation can disguise the consistent strength of
BAT's outstanding record.''
   The three-page letter called on shareholders to reject the bid
``as decisively as they have done so far by doing absolutely
nothing.''

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Plummet On Producer Sales, Strong Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices tumbled to life-of-contract lows Tuesday on
New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange following a selloff Monday
on the London market that analysts attributed to signs that supplies
will remain abundant.
   On other markets, coffee and cattle futures fell sharply; energy
and wheat futures advanced; and precious metals retreated.
   Cocoa futures settled $75 to $78 lower with the contract for
delivery in September at $1,045 a ton.
   Analysts cited a variety of bearish fundamental and technical
factors behind the market's decline, including rumors that a large
purchase of Ivory Coast cocoa was in danger of falling through, and
reports that Cameroon, another major cocoa producer, had followed
the Ivory Coast's lead in lowering its minimum guaranteed price to
farmers.
   ``There's an implication there that they might be aggressive in
selling cocoa in the future,'' said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst in
New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The sell-off occurred on the eve of a meeting of some of the
world's largest cocoa producers to discuss a strategy for restoring
stability to the cocoa market through a strengthening of the
International Cocoa Association cartel.
   But analysts noted that Malaysia, the world's fourth-largest
cocoa producer, was not joining the cartel, so there is little
chance for an effective international agreement.
   Coffee futures fell amid profit-taking in New York after posting
strong gains last week.
   Green, unroasted coffee settled 2.7 cents to 5 cents lower with
September at 84.30 cents a pound.
   Live cattle futures plummeted on signs that an expected drop in
cattle marketings was not materializing.
   Many traders had been convinced that supplies of fattened cattle
would dry up in late summer and early fall due to a drop in
first-and second-quarter feedlot placements.
   But many feedlot operators saw the same pattern developing and
delayed marketing of cattle off of feedlots, hoping to sell them a
little later at higher prices.
   Because so many feedlot operators delayed marketings, the
expected drop in supplies never developed, said Chuck Levitt, senior
livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Anticipation was the name of the game and everyone responded to
it,'' he said.
   Live cattle settled .13 cent to 1.25 cents lower with October at
72.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .50 cent lower
with October at 81.12 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to .88
cent lower with October at 39.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .45 cent to 1.05 cents lower with February at 43.37 cents a
pound.
   Energy futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
paced by an advance in wholesale home heating oil and gasoline due
to stronger worldwide demand and expectations for a temporary drop
in supply.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents to 20 cents
higher with October at $19.05 a barrel; heating oil was .53 cent to
.60 cent higher with October at 54.57 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .45 cent to .68 cent higher with October at 53.76 cents
a gallon.
   Wheat futures posted solid gains on the Chicago Board of Trade in
reaction to improved foreign demand for U.S. wheat while corn and
soybean futures prices retreated in lackluster trading.
   The wheat market was supported by last week's sale of 200,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat to China and indications the Chinese may
have purchased another large shipment over the weekend, analysts
said.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced it had
targeted the Philippines for sales of 600,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices.
   Wheat settled } cent lower to 5} cents higher with September at
$3.97\ a bushel; corn was { cent to 1} cents lower with September at
$2.32\ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with
September at $1.34} a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents lower to } cent
higher with September at $5.81\ a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures retreated slightly in quiet trading on
New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled $1 lower across the board with October at $361.40 a
troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents to 1.5 cents lower with September
at $5.063 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Pan Am to Expand Florida Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. announced plans Tuesday to increase its
Florida service by nearly 50 percent as Miami-based Eastern Airlines
enters the seventh month of its leaner, post-strike schedule.
   The expansion, scheduled to begin next month, will increase the
average number of daily Pan Am flights operating in Florida during
the mid-winter from 48 to 70.
   Pan Am acknowledged that the expansion was aimed, at least in
part, at filling the void left by rival Eastern.
   ``It's a big part of it,'' said Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon
in New York.
   On Oct. 1, Pan Am will begin operating three daily flights
between Miami International Airport and Nassau, Bahamas.
   The next phase of expansion will start Oct. 29 with service from
Miami to Philadelphia, Boston, Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and Charlotte,
N.C. Also that day, daily flights to St. Maarten and Antigua from
Miami are scheduled to begin.
   The New York-based carrier will resume service to San Juan,
Puerto Rico, on Dec. 15 with four flights daily from Miami. The
airline stopped flying to San Juan in 1983.
   Other flights planned from Miami include a fifth daily flight to
New York's LaGuardia Airport and a third daily flight to Washington,
D.C.
   New service between New York's Kennedy International Airport and
Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida also will
be included in the expansion.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell declined to comment on Pan Am's
plans.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Consent Decree in Racial Suit Against GM</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday approved a settlement of a
6-year-old racial discrimination suit against General Motors Corp.
that requires the automaker to pay up to $3 million.
   The suit claimed that GM discriminated against nearly 10,000
salaried black employees in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana in its
promotion, wage, transfer and layoff policies. Of those, about 7,000
still work for GM.
   After years of legal wrangling, attorneys for GM and the
employees reached an agreement Oct. 21, 1988.
   The decree calls on GM to pay between $1 million and $1.6 million
to about 2,800 former employees, depending on the number of claims
filed. GM also will pay about $1 million in salary increases
immediately to about 1,000 current employees. Eighty-eight
individual plaintiffs and witnesses will split about $322,500 in
one-time payments.
   The settlement also establishes a system to monitor discretionary
pay raises and promotions for five years based on computer models.
That portion of the agreement has the potential of being the most
beneficial, said attorney Dennis James, who represented the
employees.
   ``We think that's where the vast benefit comes in,'' he said.
``It will affect a substantial increase in black salaried promotions
compared to the past patterns.''
   GM spokesman John Mueller said company officials ha not seen the
order. However, he said the agreement, ``provides the opportunity to
redress some perceived inequities and strengthens GM's existing
systems to ensure all employees receive equitable treatment.''

<HEAD>Machinists Skeptical of Pilots' Bid For United</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Unionized machinists and ground crews expressed
doubt Tuesday that a pilot-led takeover attempt worth $6.75 billion
for the parent of United Airlines could succeed because it would
require enormous new debt.
   The Machinists' stance seemed to strengthen the chances that
California investor Marvin Davis could succeed in his rival bid for
UAL Corp.
   Cooperation of by all of the company's workers is seen by some
industry analysts as crucial to the pilot-led offer, which would be
undertaken with management and make UAL the biggest employee-owned
company in the country.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers
said in a statement that UAL was worth about $2 billion less than
the labor-management offer, which was announced Friday.
   ``We are very skeptical that United Airlines could survive in
today's marketplace with the additional debt that would be placed on
the carrier under this proposal as we understand it, particularly
since the proposed purchase price far exceeds the value of the
airline,'' said John Peterpaul, general vice president of the
Machinists union.
   He said the Machinists had not been invited to participate in any
discussions regarding the labor-management proposal disclosed Friday.
   Hank Krakowski, a spokesman for the United chapter of the Air
Line Pilots Association, said he had not seen the Machinists'
statement and could not comment on it. But, he said, ``it is our
strong desire to have all employees on board this proposal.''
   Meanwhile, UAL's stock price climbed Tuesday amid speculation
that Davis would top the pilot-management offer for UAL of $300 a
share, possibly with help from a foreign carrier.
   UAL closed at $290.75 a share in nationwide New York Stock
Exchange trading, up $3.75 from Friday's close.
   ``The market thinks something else is going to happen,'' said
Andrew Geller, an airline industry analyst with Provident National
Bank in Philadelphia. ``I think there's a fair chance he'll come
back with another bid.''
   Analyst Edward Starkman of PaineWebber Inc. interpreted the
market action as investor caution.
   ``The offer on the table ... is going to be tough to beat,'' he
said.
   Davis, a California billionaire who put UAL in play last month
with a $240-a-share offer that he later sweetened to $275, was
reportedly seeking the help of foreign airlines in an attempt to
outbid the insider group.
   The New York Times quoted an unidentified source in the Davis
camp as saying Davis was talking with European and non-European
carriers.
   The Davis group did not return telephone calls seeking
confirmation of the report.
   Davis previously indicated he might increase his bid to acquire
United, the nation's second-largest airline.
   The bid by the labor-management alliance has financial backing
from British Airways PLC.
   If successful, the labor-management group's plan would result in
75 percent employee ownership, making UAL the country's largest
worker-owned company. British Airways would own 15 percent of the
company and UAL's management, led by Chairman Stephen Wolf, would
hold 10 percent.
   Federal aviation regulators reportedly are concerned with the
involvement of foreign entities in takeovers of U.S. airlines.
Government authorities are expected to closely examine proposed
acquisitions that include non-U.S. backers.
   The 6,300-member United chapter of the pilots union helped devise
the labor-management offer and is the only UAL employee group
committed to participating in a buyout.
   United's 12,700 flight attendants have indicated a willingness to
discuss participation. The Machinists, which represent the company's
mechanics and ground crews, haven't ruled it out but the union's
statement Tuesday strongly suggested they wouldn't participate.
   The pilots have indicated their bid may be partly financed with
pension money. But Brian Freeman, a financial adviser to the
Machinists, has said it is ``inconceivable'' that his group,
representing 25,000 of United's 70,000 workers, would invest pension
funds in UAL.
   Starkman said the pilots would have a difficult time running UAL
without strong support from the other unions.
   ``What really makes this deal go or not is the cooperation of
labor,'' he said.
   UAL has said its board of directors will form a committee to
review the bids for the company.

<TEXT>
   The blockbuster action film ``Batman'' and the
comedies ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and ``Parenthood'' helped
Hollywood rack up a record summer gate of $2.05 billion, according
to figures released Tuesday.
   Box-office revenues from Memorial Day to Labor Day were up 20
percent from last summer's record $1.7 billion.
   ``Batman'' emerged as at least the sixth-biggest smash in movie
history with ticket sales to date of $238.6 million.
   ``Nobody in the business can predict how big a movie goes once it
goes big,'' said Rob Friedman, president of worldwide advertising
and publicity for Warner Bros. ``Did we know `Batman' was going to
be a big movie? Yes. Did we know how big? You never know.''
   Exhibitor Relations Co. President John Krier, whose company
compiles box office figures, said, ``The popularity of `Batman'
created a lot of interest in other movies. And once people arrived,
there was a little bit of everything out there, great variety.''
   Among those contributing to the record season were adult
moviegoers, who in recent years have stayed at home. Although exact
figures were unavailable, it is believed older patrons boosted the
grosses of ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Parenthood'' and ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids.'
   ``I've always maintained that if there are good movies out there,
people will go to them,'' said Si Kornblit, executive vice president
of worldwide marketing for Universal, which distributed
``Parenthood.''
   The healthy summer season was expected to lead to a record year
at the nation's theaters, which took in $4.46 billion last year.
   In a summer stuffed with sequels, ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade,'' ``Lethal Weapon 2'' and ``Ghostbusters II'' entertained
capacity crowds for weeks.
   But it was original, uncalculated programming such as ``Dead
Poets Society,'' ``When Harry Met Sally ...,'' ``Parenthood'' and
``Turner &amp; Hooch'' that gave this summer's Top 10 list its real
depth.
   Five summer movies surpassed the $100 million mark. The top five,
respectively, were ``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade,'' which pulled in $189.5 million; ``Lethal Weapon 2''
($131.3 million), ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' ($119.1 million) and
``Ghostbusters II'' ($109.9 million). The titles accounted for 40
percent of all summer tickets sold.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Dead Poets Society'' ($86.4
million), ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' ($66.6 million),
``Parenthood'' ($64.1 million), ``Turner &amp; Hooch'' ($57.1 million)
and ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' ($50.5 million).
   Even though it finished in the Top 10, ``Star Trek V: The Final
Frontier'' was not a huge hit, as were a number of other heavily
promoted sequels. ``Karate Kid III'' and the latest James Bond
installment ``Licence to Kill'' also failed to spin turnstiles with
any consistency, earning $37.9 million and $33.2 million,
respectively.
   In the horror genre, the retreads ``A Nightmare on Elm Street 5:
The Dream Child'' and ``Friday the 13th VIII: Jason Takes
Manhattan'' did not make killings at the box office. Those films had
revenues of $20 million and $14.1 million.
   Several other summer films featuring superstar names yielded
benchwarmer business. The high-powered flops included Clint
Eastwood's ``Pink Cadillac'' ($12.1 million), Sylvester Stallone in
``Lock Up'' ($17.1 million), ``Casualties of War'' starring Michael
J. Fox and Sean Penn ($13.7 million), and Dennis Quaid's ``Great
Balls of Fire'' ($13.7 million).
   Several industry observers have said the summer record was
sparked by higher ticket prices, with some theaters in New York and
Los Angeles charging $7 per admission.
   The studios countered that today's movies must compete with
pay-cable television and videocassette rentals.
   Warner Bros., propelled by ``Batman'' and ``Lethal Weapon 2,''
led the studios in summer revenues. The studio accounted for 24
percent of all tickets sold.
   Disney, with no sequels and no overpublicized epics, quietly
claimed the No. 2 spot with its ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and
``Dead Poets Society.''
   Among the major studios, Tri-Star and MGM-UA had the most
miserable summers, finishing last and next-to-last, respectively.

   A $16 million plan filed in federal
bankruptcy court Tuesday seeks to end a multibillion dollar battle
between former financier Marvin Warner and creditors claiming losses
from a bank collapse that threw the Ohio thift industry into a
tailspin, attorneys said.
   Under the plan filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here, Warner would
immediately pay $10 million and make three annual $2 million
payments beginning with the first anniversary of the plan's approval.
   Warner, 70, the target of a flood of lawsuits following the
collapse of his Cincinnati-based Home State Savings Bank in March
1985, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 1987
against creditors seeking more than $4.5 billion.
   A motion filed with the proposal states that approval ``would
settle virtually all adversary proceedings and litigation related to
this bankruptcy case.''
   Warner, the former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, will also pay
all legal fees and administrative costs, and an estimated $2 million
in taxes associated with liquidation of assets to pay the settlement.
   The creditors agreeing to the settlement include: Ohio Deposit
Guarantee Fund, which went bankrupt because it insured Home State;
American Savings &amp; Loan Assocation of Florida; Thomas Tew, a trustee
at the defunct ESM Government Securities; Fidata Corp. and several
communities that invested with ESM such as Beaumont, Texas, Clark
County, Nev., and Harrisburg and Dauphin County, Pa.
   They will be paid a pro-rated share of the $16 million, attorneys
said.
   Also filed was a motion asking U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George
Proctor to convert the case back to a Chapter 11 reorganization case
from a Chapter 7 liquidation case. Proctor converted Warner's
bankruptcy case to liquidation on July 31.
   Court officials say they do not know how the proposal would
affect a hearing scheduled Thursday to deal with an earlier motion
to reconvert the case to Chapter 11.
   The pact must be approved by Proctor and Hamilton County, Ohio,
Common Pleas Judge Richard Niehaus, who will be asked to reduce a
$22 million restitution order in 1987 to cover losses from the Home
State collapse.
   ``Warner will be left essentially with his farm,'' which is
located in Ocala, said Jack R. Pigman, an attorney for Connie J.
Harris Smallwood, superintendent of Ohio's Division of Savings and
Loan Association.
   But Niehaus, who presided at Warner's 1985 criminal conviction
resulting from the Home State collapse, has been firm so far in
upholding the restitution figure.
   Warner said Friday he decided to pursue a settlement because of
the pressure the court proceedings have placed on his family.
   ``My family, my wife and children have suffered and have suffered
enough,'' said Warner, who now lives on a 153-acre horse farm.
``Were it up to me alone, I would continue the battle of redemption
with the last ounce of my strength.''
   Pigman said under the settlement, Ohio will get about $8 million.
Coupled with funds recovered in other Home State legal actions, the
state will have collected over $100 million. And there are still
sources of additional funds, he said.
   The state paid out $129 million to reimburse Home State
depositors, float bonds needed to sell Home State to other banks and
resolve the savings and loan crisis that saw 70 Ohio thrifts
temporarily closed in 1985.
   Warner was convicted on Ohio felony charges in Home State's
collapse but was acquitted of federal charges in a separate trial.
He is appealing the state conviction and the restitution order.
   Home State collapsed four days after Fort Lauderdale-based ESM
was shut down by federal regulators for insolvency. Home State had
invested heavily with ESM through securities trade and lost $144
million when ESM was closed.
   Settlement talks, going on since January, picked up speed last
week after Ronald Mowrey, a former FBI agent and Tallahassee
attorney, was appointed to begin liquidating Warner's assets.
   Mowrey conducted an inventory of Warner's Ohio farm near in
Clermont County last week.

   Unionized machinists and ground crews expressed
doubt that a pilot-led takeover attempt worth $6.75 billion for the

   Everybody doesn't like something, but nobody
likes being told a ``light'' cheesecake has fewer calories than the
regular version when it really doesn't, Attorney General Jim Mattox
says.
   Announcing a settlement Tuesday with the Sara Lee Corp., Mattox
said the Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp. will stop advertising that its
``light'' cheesecake and pound cake snacks have fewer calories than
its regular cakes.
   Mattox said that Sara Lee's Light Classics cheesecakes and its
All Butter Pound Cake Snack have more calories and fat than the
original Creme Cheesecake and Original All Butter Pound Cake,
respectively.
   The advertisements for the ``light'' cheesecake and pound cake
were misleading, Mattox said.
   ``Those of us who are weight-watchers and connoisseurs of
desserts need as much help as we can get,'' Mattox said.
``Mislabeling a dessert is unfair to consumers.''
   In Chicago, Sara Lee said the agreement involved the use of the
words ``Light Classics'' on the packaging and advertising of its
French Cheesecake, Strawberry French Cheesecake, Chocolate Mousse
and Strawberry Mousse desserts.
   ``The word `light' appeared in small print and referred to the
desserts' texture,'' said T. Patrick Costello, president of Sara Lee
Bakery's Retail division. ``These products were formulated to
respond to consumers who prefer authentic whipped French-style
cheesecakes and mousses.''
   He said while Sara Lee felt the objection ``has no merit in
fact,'' the company decided to settle the dispute ``because it will
save us additional, costly legal expenses.''
   Under the settlement, reached with Mattox and the attorneys
general of eight other states, Sara Lee agreed to stop the
advertising, to display the per-serving calorie content of its
products, and said any product labeled ``light'' will contain no
more than two-thirds of the calories of the product to which it is
being compared, Mattox said.
   The company also will pay each state $10,000 in investigative
costs, Mattox said. The other states involved in the settlement are
California, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New
York and Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department ordered shrimp
fishermen Tuesday to install ``trap door'' devices in their nets to
protect endangered sea turtles.
   The decision came after months of controversy during which Gulf
Coast shrimpers argued the requirement would threaten their
livlihood.
   Shrimpers immediately denounced the government order and
suggested some fishermen may not comply with the regulation, despite
a maximum $20,000 fine per violation.
   ``It's going to drive a lot of people out of business,''
maintained Jimmy Russell, president of the 200-boat Brownsville-Port
Isabel Shrimp Producers Association on the Texas coast. ``I wouldn't
be surprised if they have a lot of people tell them they're not
going to do it.''
   The government directive came under a court order requiring the
Commerce Department take action to protect the turtles, thousands of
which drown yearly when caught in the nets of shrimp fishermen,
primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The question of how to protect the turtles prompted lawsuits by a
half dozen environmental groups seeking to protect the turtles and
charges from shrimp fishermen groups that the use of the trap door
devices will cause them to lose a significant part of their daily
catch.
   Last July, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher suspended
enforcement of a regulation requiring the devices after angry Gulf
Coast shrimpers blockaded shipping channels along the Texas coast
and threatened violence against law officers and the Coast Guard if
the requirement were enforced.
   Among the species to be protected by the so-called ``turtle
excluder devices'' _ or TEDs _ are the Kemp's ridley, leatherneck
and hawksbill, all of which are listed as endangered species, and
the loggerhead and green se turtles which are listed as being
threatened.
   In making the announcement, John A. Knauss, undersecretary of
commerce, said that under the federal Endangered Species Act ``the
only way to ensure protection of these vanishing species is through
the use of TEDs.''
   ``There is no other choice,'' Knauss said in a statement.
   The decision takes effect Friday.
   Commerce spokesman Brian Gorman said violators could be fined as
much as $20,000 per violation, although penalties likely will be in
the $8,000 range in most cases. Fishermen will have a grace period
until Oct. 15 where all or some of the fine would be suspended if
the violator installed the required net equipment.
   Knauss said attempts to protect the turtles by limiting the
length of time that shrimpers' nets are in the water _ an approach
that has been tried in recent months _ was insufficient to protect
the turtles.
   The decision immediately was hailed by environmental group which
had filed suit seeking the government to require that the trap door
devices be used by Gulf Coast shrimpers. Many shrimpers off the
south Atlantic coast already use the devices.
   ``The decision is certainly what we had hoped for,'' said Michael
Weber, vice president of the Center for Marine Conservation. He
added, however, that he expects possible legal attemps by shrimpers
to get the decision reversed or pressure in Congress to have the
regulation changed.
   ``Basically we're pleased, but we're sorry it took so long and we
had to jump through so many legal hoops,'' said Charles Miller, a
spokesman for the National Wildlife Federation. ``At this point the
turtles are going to have fighting chance.''
   The controversy over the use of the so-called TEDs has dominated
this year's Gulf Coast shrimping season.
   Last May, the Commerce Department directed that the trap-door
devices be installed by shrimp fishermen in the Gulf Coast where an
estimated 11,000 sea turtles are reportedly drown annually when
caught in the nets.
   But the shrimpers loudly protested use of the TEDs, an
oval-shaped metal grate about four feet in diameter that is place
inside the funnel-like shrimp nets to allow large animals such as
turtles to be diverted and escape through a special trap door.
   The shrimpers argued that the devices also cause them to lose
large amounts of shrimp _ as much as 40 percent of the catch,
according to some fishermen. Environmentalists have argued that such
assertions are wrong and that at worst only about 2 percent of the
shrimp catch is affected, and possibly less if the TEDs are used
properly.
   Because of economic concerns, Mosbacher ordered a two-month delay
in enforcing the federal requirement for the devices. In July, after
sometimes violent protests erupted among some Gulf Coast shrimp
fishermen over the use of TEDs, Mosbacher gave the shrimpers a
choice of using the devices or limiting their thrawl times.
   The federal courts, however, ordered a final rule to be issued by
Sept. 8, prompting the Commerce Department decision Tuesday to
return to requiring the use of the trap door devices.
   Environmentalists warn that several of the sea turtle species _
especially the Kemp's ridley _ may be doomed to extinction in the
coming decades if they are not protected from shrimpers nets. The
number of female Kemp's ridley sea turtles nesting each year has
declined from some 42,000 in the 1940s to no more than 700 today,
according to James Ross, an expert on sea turtles.
   Ross said that from 600 to 1,600 Kemp's ridely turtles are killed
each year often after the young turtles get in the way of the
shrimping nets. The decline of the species is estimated at about 3
percent a year, he said.

   Irving Azoff, who in six years
resurrected MCA Records from a sleepy also-ran to the No. 2 pop
music label, quit Tuesday to form his own entertainment company.
   ``What I want to do is a broad-based company, the cornerstone of
which will be a record company,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``Basically, I intend to start the first major independent of the
'90s with major funding.''
   Azoff said he was evaluating an offer from MCA to fund the
venture. Asked if there had been other offers, he said, ``The phones
always ring.''
   Before joining MCA, Azoff achieved prominence by his deft
handling of the careers of such rock superstars as the Eagles, Boz
Scaggs and Steely Dan. Many thought him crazy when he decided in
April 1983 to join the company he once characterized as the ``Music
Cemetery of America.''
   ``The roster I inherited was uniquely interesting,'' Azoff said
in a letter to MCA employees Tuesday. ``Could we ever forget The
Catholic Girls, MCA's answer to the Go-Go's; Zoom, the black
heavy-metal band; and Helen Reddy, best remembered as a nun in
`Airport '75.'''
   After he joined MCA, the company dropped 41 of its 46 acts and
started rebuilding, often resurrecting the careers of other labels'
discards.
   Most significantly, Azoff broadened the label's base beyond rock
and jazz into black music, by signing such acts as Klymaxx,
Stephanie Mills, Patti LaBelle and Gladys Knight, and contemporary
country, with artists such as The Judds, Lyle Lovett, George Strait
and Reba McEntire.
   ``Today our roster boasts some of the most impressive names in
contemporary including ... Bobby Brown, Elton John, Boston, Tiffany,
Jody Watley, New Edition, Pebbles and Fine Young Cannibals,'' Azoff
said.
   A proxy statement shows Azoff was paid about $5 million in salary
and stock last year. Also in 1988, Billboard magazine reported MCA
had become the No. 2 pop label behind CBS Records. MCA was ranked
12th in 1983, the year Azoff signed on.
   In a statement, MCA said Azoff resigned as an MCA Inc. vice
president and as chairman of its Music Entertainment Group, and was
working on his future plans, including possible business ventures
with MCA.
   Reports had circulated for several months that Azoff wanted to
run his own company along the lines of David Geffen, who controls
the powerful music and movie company named after him.
   The trade newspaper Daily Variety said Azoff had been variously
reported to be negotiating with Polygram, Warner Communications and
Boston Ventures, the investment firm with which MCA teamed last year
to buy Motown Records, as well as MCA itself.
   MCA president and chief operating officer Sid Sheinberg referred
to those talks in a news release.
   ``We are very hopeful that negotiations for us to continue to be
involved with Irving in exciting new music entertainment
undertakings will come to a successful and mutually beneficial
conclusion,'' he said.
   Azoff will be succeeded as chairman of MCA Music by Al Teller, a
former CBS Records president who joined MCA last year as a corporate
vice president and president and chief operating officer of MCA
Records.
   Statistics for MCA's Music and Entertainment Group help convey
how Azoff converted MCA into a challenger to such recording giants
as CBS Records and Warner Bros. Records.
   For the 1982 fiscal year, MCA's recording and music-publishing
operations grossed $141.7 million; for fiscal 1988, the Music
Entertainment Group, which includes home-video revenues, grossed
$661 million.
   During his career at MCA, Azoff was plagued by allegations of
conflict of interest because of his partial ownership of three
outside companies that did business with MCA.
   In May 1986, MCA bought the companies: Front Line Management,
which handled Don Henley, Stevie Nicks, Jimmy Buffett and Heart;
Full Moon Records, a small label whose artists included Dan
Fogelberg and Chicago; and Facilities Merchandising Inc., which
handles vending of T-shirts, caps and other novelties at more than
40 arenas nationwide.
   Under Azoff, MCA Records boycotted an industry move in 1985 to
put warning stickers on records that contain ``obscene'' material.
   Besides the record company, the Music Entertainment Group
includes MCA's music-publishing business; its records and home video
distribution unit; the Universal Amphitheater in Universal City and
amphitheaters in Atlanta, Dallas and Denver; and several other
businesses.
   Azoff will continue to act as a consultant for the facilities
merchandising unit, which Azoff founded before joining MCA.

   A former First Jersey Securities Inc. broker
on Tuesday admitted helping launder $450,000 of his clients' money,
partly at the direction of a branch manager who also was identified
as a top-ranking member of the troubled firm.
   Kevin O'Donohue, 32, was the second employee of First Jersey's
Cherry Hill office to admit to charges in a federal money laundering
probe.
   At his plea, Donohue named three other Cherry Hill employees not
previously said to be involved in the scheme, bringing to seven the
number of First Jersey brokers implicated.
   First Jersey sold its retail network in February 1987. Donohue's
admissions concerned money laundering from February 1984 to October
1985.
   A call for comment to the company's headquarters in New York was
not returned.
   Under a plea agreement with prosecutors, O'Donohue admitted a
conspiracy charge and will cooperate with the investigation. In
exchange, eight other counts will be dropped.
   O'Donohue faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he
is sentenced, which U.S. District Judge John Bissell scheduled for
Nov. 9.
   He admitted helping to hide a couple's funds from the Internal
Revenue Service by taking large amounts of cash, breaking them into
cashiers checks smaller than $10,000 and depositing the checks in
the couple's brokerage account. First Jersey records also were
falsified, he said.
   By law, transactions involving more than $10,000 must be reported
to the government.
   The couple, identified in the indictment as Theodore and Barbara
Schallenhammer, used the funds to buy stock. Assistant U.S. Attorney
Andrew Rossner said they were not charged. Their attorney, Morris
Pinsky, did not immediately return a phone message.
   Donohue said branch manager Jack Mondel directed him and another
broker to translate the Schallenhammer's money into cashiers checks.
Rossner said Mondel was a regional vice president of First Jersey.
   Mondel could not be reached for comment and Rossner did not know
his whereabouts or lawyer's name.
   Paul Fau of Mount Laurel, a former branch manager in Cherry Hill,
pleaded guilty in June to money laundering. Former Cherry Hill
broker Arthur Basmajian of Pittsburgh awaits trial, as does Dominic
Padula of Paterson.
   Padula was accused of helping launder $430,000 for one customer's
account between August 1983 and November 1985. Donohue said two
other brokers who have not been charged were involved in the money
laundering.
   First Jersey, founded by high-flying financier Robert E. Brennan,
and some of its employees have been the subject of investigations by
federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission for
15 years.
   Charges include stock manipulation, illegal campaign
contributions, excessive markups and perjury. Brennan has denied
improprieties.
   The firm settled allegations of fraudulent securities practices
with the SEC in 1984.

   Spy, the irreverant New York humor magazine, can
distribute its spoof of Cliff's Notes, the long-established study
guide to the classics, a federal appeals panel ruled Tuesday.
   Three judges of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a
lower court's injunction that banned the distribution of Spy Notes,
a parody that used the Cliff's Notes format to also poke fun at what
Spy Co-Editor Kurt Andersen called the ``hip urban novel.''

The judges said a full opinion would follow.
   ``It is a happy day for us and the First Amendment,'' Andersen
said.
   As a result of the ruling, Spy Notes is expected to be on sale at
bookstores around the country by the week of Sept. 18, said
Jacqueline Deval, a spokeswoman for the parody's publisher, Bantum
Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc.
   Spy Notes gives humorous plot summaries, commentary and questions
for review on contemporary novels like ``Bright Lights, Big City''
by Jay McInerney and ``Slaves of New York'' by Tama Janowitz.
   It also includes the Novel-O-Matic, a slide rule-like device that
Andersen says allows readers to create their own 1980s novel.
   Cliff's Notes Inc. sued the publishing concern because it claimed
the parody, whose cover has Cliff's Notes distinctive
yellow-and-black stripes, looked too much like the real thing and
would confuse consumers.
   U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram granted Cliff's Notes a
preliminary injunction on Aug. 2 and Doubleday immediately appealed.
   ``Needless to say, we're sorely disappointed by the ruling,''
said Cliff's Notes attorney William Hart. He said he could not
comment further until the appeals panel issued a full opinion.

<HEAD>World Bank Grants Would Help Poor Countries Pay Off Commercial Banks</HEAD>

   The World Bank, owned by 151 countries, is
planning grants from a new $100 million package to help some of the
world's poorest countries pay off loans to commercial banks, a
spokesman for the World Bank said Tuesday.
   It is expected that the governments will be able to buy back some
of these commercial bank loans for a fraction of their original
value.
   World Bank spokesman William Brannigan said that the amount owed
by any one country to any one bank would be small, and that the
banks would be glad to get the loans off their books.
   Possible candidates would be Bangladesh and Nepal in Asia, and
countries in southern Africa where average incomes are one dollar a
year or less.
   It is expected that a country would only be eligible if it is up
to date on repayments of loans to the World Bank itself, and has set
up a new economic program satisfactory to it or its sister
organization, the International Monetary Fund.
   Big debtors like Brazil, Argentina and Mexico would not qualify.
   Brannigan said the plan has been approved by the World Bank's
Board of Executive Directors, 22 representatives chosen by the 151
governments. But he said approval is still needed from the Board of
Governors, which is composed of Treasury Secretary Nochlas F. Brady,
who controls the largest single block of shares in the World Bank,
and ministers of finance of the other member governments.
   The Board of Governors will hold its annual meeting in Washington
at the end of this month.
   Brannigan said its approval is needed because the World Bank
wants to take the $100 million from $1 billion earned annually by
its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and use
the money for grants by its International Development Association.
   The IBRD makes a profit by borrowing money at low rates on the
market and lending it to Third World governments at higher rates,
but for longer periods than those offered by commercial banks and to
many countries they refuse to lend to.
   IDA makes loans to the poorest countries for as long as 50 years
at less than 1 percent interest, but normally does not make outright
grants. It gets most of its money from direct contributions by the
United States and 32 other donor countries.
   Brannigan pointed out that money owed by the poorest countries
was lent largely by governments and intergovernment bodies like the
World Bank. It is estimated that the total they owe commercial banks
is about $2 billion.
   Juergen Warnke, West Germany's minister for cooperation, told
reporters last week that his country alone had cancelled more than
$4.4 billion in loans over the past 10 years.
   President Bush announced in July that the United States will also
be canceling some debts, estimated at $1 billion, to the poorest
countries.

<HEAD>Suez Appears To Have Won France's Biggest Takeover Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compagnie Financiere de Suez on Tuesday appeared to
have won France's largest takeover battle after it sweetened its bid
for Compagnie Industrielle and its insurance unit and reached a
truce with dissident shareholders.
   Analysts said the accord and sweetened tender offer, valued at
$4.1 billion, means Suez, a financial holding company, should have
no difficulty winning control of Industrielle and Compagnie
Financiere du Groupe Victoire, France's second-largest insurer.
   Suez announced it was raising its offer from the equivalent of
about $1,940 a share to about $2,208, a share for Industrielle
stock. It will boost its bid for common stock in Groupe Victoire
from $298 to $340 and increase its offer for the non-voting stock
from $149 to $170.
   The initial tender offer valued Industrielle and Groupe Victoire
at about $3.5 billion.
   A spokesman for Industrielle confirmed that such an agreement had
been reached.
   As part of the accord, Industrielle President Jean-Marc Vernes
has agreed to tender the 25 percent stake in Industrielle which is
held by Societe Centrale d'Investissement, the announcement said.
Vernes holds 34 percent of Societe Centrale d'Investissement stock.
   Suez already controls about 30 percent of Groupe Victoire, and 18
percent of Industrielle. Gaining control of Industrielle would
automatically give it a majority stake in Group Victoire.
   Industrielle currently has about 40 percent in its insurance unit.
   The move follows allegations last week by Vernes that Suez had
offered him 3,000 francs, or about $478, per share above its public
stock offer. Suez denied the charges but negotiated the agreement
with Vernes, who until now had adamently opposed the offer.
   Trading in shares of Industrielle and Victoire stock, suspended
last month, resumed Monday but was suspended again Tuesday when word
of the agreement was made public.
