   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday
that the superpowers should renounce military intervention in Latin
America and the Caribbean and make the region a zone of peace.
   Addressing the Cuban National Assembly, he also emphasized that
Soviet-style reforms are not a universal remedy for other communist
countries, including Cuba.
   ``We do not regard our approaches and solutions as some
universal prescription for all,'' he said in what appeared an
attempt to minimize the difference between Cuba's orthodox
communism and Gorbachev's new pragmatism.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union opposes the ``export of
revolution or counterrevolution,'' referring to both Cuban and U.S.
policy in Latin America.
   But he also reaffirmed that the Soviet Union will continue
supplying weaponry to Nicaragua's leftist government as long as the
United States continues to arm other Central American countries.
   The issue remains a major sore point in relations between
Washington and Moscow.
   In Washington, President Bush and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III both said they had not had a chance to review Gorbachev's
speech. But Baker said his comment on Nicaragua was ``the same old
line they've been pushing.''
   There had been speculation that Gorbachev, in a gesture of
friendship toward Cuba, might announce forgiveness of part or all
of Cuba's debt to the Soviet Union.
   But he barely mentioned the subject, merely restating his
position that the industrialized nations of the world should try to
help ease the burden of debtor nations in the developing world.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro, in a 50-minute introduction that
was only three minutes shorter than his guest's address, lambasted
the United States in a characteristic diatribe. He blamed his
longtime adversary for regional conflicts throughout the world and
for ``pulling the Third World's leg'' by proposing unworkable
solutions to the critical problem of Third World debt.
   Waving his arms and jabbing his fingers, the 62-year-old Castro
rejected suggestions of friction in Soviet-Cuban relations. He said
he was in full agreement with Gorbachev's contention that each
communist country must solve the problems of developing socialism
in its own way.
   Gorbachev, who had been expected to outline Soviet policy toward
Latin America, essentially reiterated his government's longstanding
view that the United States holds the key to peace in Central
America and must halt its intervention in order to encourage
settlement of regional strife.
   ``We have a real possiblity of guaranteeing peace,'' he said,
but all sides must halt military supplies to the region.
   ``The Soviet Union does not seek for itself political, strategic
or military advantage in the Western hemisphere,'' Gorbachev said.
``We consider that this hemisphere and all others must not be an
arena for East-West confrontation.''
   In proposing establishment of a ``zone of peace,'' the Soviet
president said his country ``does not have any intention of having
in Latin America naval, air or missile bases or to place there
nuclear or other weapons of mass extermination.''
   He called on the United States and other countries to adopt a
similar approach to continue the transformation of Latin America
into a region of peace, security and stability.
   The Soviet Union and Cuba are principal suppliers of the
Sandinista regime in Nicaragua and leftist guerrillas in El
Salvador. The United States provides nonmilitary aid to Nicaragua's
Contra rebels and weaponry to the Salvadoran government, Honduras
and other nations.
   Soviet sources predicted before Gorbachev left Moscow that the
Soviet leader would try to persuade Castro to extract Cuba from
involvement in leftist struggles around the world and concentrate
on building the Cuban economy, which after three decades of
socialism is still heavily reliant on Soviet aid.
   ``We are resolutely opposed to any theories and doctrines
justifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution, all forms
of foreign interference in the affairs of sovereign states,''
Gorbachev said in his speech.
   He made similar statements after the speech at a news
conference, saying that ``power policies have totally discedited
themselves.''
   Earlier, in an interview with the Soviet news agency Tass,
Gorbachev suggested that he and Castro are prepared to work for
improved East-West relations, indicating some softening in the
Cuban leader's rigid anti-Americanism.
   Gorbachev told Tass a central topic of his talks with Castro on
Monday was the ``new thinking'' in Soviet foreign policy _ an
approach that seeks to ease world tensions by reducing military
commitments abroad and negotiating settlements of regional disputes
that threaten to bring the superpowers into conflict.
   It is a tenet of Gorbachev's reform policies at home that the
Soviet Union must demonstrate to the West it is eager to serve as a
cooperative partner in world economic development and dispel the
Kremlin's ``enemy image'' of the Cold War era.
   Castro and Gorbachev signed a 25-year accord the Cuban news
agency Prensa Latina said dashes all speculation about a rift
between Havana and Moscow and ratifies their ``traditional
relations.''
   But despite a show of friendship between he two communist
allies, a series of arrests in Havana on Tuesday underscored the
differences between the pragmatic liberalism espoused by Gorbachev
and the tight control still exercised by Castro 30 years after he
led a guerrilla army to victory over a right-wing dictatorship.
   Police rounded up seven dissidents who were planning a
demonstration Tuesday evening in support of Gorbachev's reforms.
Among those detained was Samuel Martinez Lara, leader of the
Pro-Human Rights Party, according to government and dissident
spokesmen.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
condemned the arrests, saying they underscore ``the need for
ongoing monitoring of the human rights situation in Cuba.''

<HEAD>20 Years After Transplant, Cooley Says Ethics, Regulations Hinder
Advances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years after he performed the world's first
implant of an artificial heart into a human, Dr. Denton A. Cooley
on Tuesday said further medical advances have been hindered by
ethical doubts and regulatory interference.
   Despite the difficulties, Cooley said on the anniversary of the
operation that he expects still greater achievements over the next
20 years.
   ``The heart is truly a remarkable organ and developing a perfect
substitute is going to be a challenge not only for this generation,
but for generations of researchers to come,'' Cooley said.
   ``Research institutions and investigators throughout the world
are challenged by this project, and I think that we will see an
acceptable, totally implantable permanent device within the next 15
to 20 years.''
   It was April 4, 1969, when Cooley and his associates at the
Texas Heart Institute implanted a totally artificial heart into the
chest of Haskell Karp, a 47-year-old printing estimator from
Skokie, Ill.
   Karp lived for three days on the device and then received a
human heart transplant but died a day later when infection and
tissue rejection set in.
   Cooley had first attempted a surgical repair of Karp's heart,
but the organ was too badly damaged and it was clear he would not
survive, the doctor said.
   ``This was the first time that we decided we weren't going to
pull the plug, but that we were going to give this man that remote
chance of survival,'' Cooley said.
   The first heart transplant had been performed less than two
years before. The proven human use of an artificial heart _ which
earlier had shown promise in research animals _ elated the surgical
team but drew a harsh reaction from some medical professionals and
the public.
   Cooley was censured by the Harris County Medical Society for
``publicity,'' which meant violating the society's guidelines about
having a physician's name appear in a newspaper in connection with
the name of a patient.
   ``All the theoretical objections really almost killed the
transplant program; that, coupled with the high incidence of tissue
rejection, which brought a lot of bad news to the profession,''
Cooley said.
   Since then, however, the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine came
into use and advanced artificial hearts have improved survival
until donor hearts can be found. And greater public acceptance has
made donor organs more plentiful.
   However, new obstacles have emerged, including burdensome
federal regulations that limit the application of medical research,
said Dr. O.H. Frazier, who directs the cardiovascular surgical
research lab at the Texas Heart Institute.
   ``I'm not sure today if that first step wasn't taken in 1969 how
we would take it today,'' Frazier said.
   Cooley agrees that regulations make research applications more
difficult today, but he believes the Food and Drug Administration
is not directly to blame.
   ``I know that the individuals at the (FDA) who are responsible
for these restrictions are people who are well motivated, but they
are responding basically to what the public seems to want,'' Cooley
said.
   ``I don't believe we ought to live in a completely unregulated
society, but I think that our restrictions should be liberal enough
that progress can be made.''

   Alan Feinstein is a seasoned veteran of the
performing arts who remembers his acting debut as anything but
auspicious.
   ``I grew up in Queens, New York, and started acting as a senior
in high school,'' he recalls. ``The very first play I did I blew my
lines. I heard my cue, walked on stage and repeated the cue. I
couldn't remember my line.
   ``I muddled around and then got off stage as fast as I could. It
didn't deter me from pursuing this wonderfully capricious
business.''
   Feinstein started work on CBS' night-time soap opera ``Falcon
Crest,'' his eighth television series, in December. He plays
Malcolm Sinclair, a wealthy businessman who becomes involved in
tricky dealings with Richard Channing (David Selby) and Pilar
Ortega (Kristian Alfonso).
   ``He (Sinclair) is teaming up with Jane Wyman to stop her son
(Selby) from industrializing the Tuscany Valley and taking over the
winery,'' he said. ``They were talking abut my character before I
even showed up. After I was cast I watched the show to see what
they were saying about Malcolm. They knew I was coming even before
I knew I was coming.''
   Feinstein had only a two-day rest before starting on ``Falcon
Crest'' after completing seven months on the ABC daytime soap
``General Hospital'' as the ``mysterious stranger'' in Port Charles.
   ``I was a wealthy developer who ran for the state assembly on
`General Hospital,''' he said. ``I was married but running around
with Jackie Zeman. I wasn't a heavy, just a guy in an unhappy
marriage. I fell for Jackie, but after I won the election I went
off to Albany and tried to settle with my wife.''
   His first professional role was as a football player in an
episode of ``Naked City,'' which he got because of his prowess as a
college basketball and track and field performer. He'd been lifting
weights and looked the part.
   ``I was only in it for a second,'' he said. ``Sandy Dennis and
Aldo Ray were the stars of the episode. I kept a photo copy of the
check for $24 that I received.''
   His first regular role was the soap opera ``Love of Life,''
which he starred on for 2{ years. Next, he spent six years on
``Edge of Night.'' At the same time, he starred in a Broadway
revival of ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' He was also on ``Search
for Tomorrow,'' but only for a very brief time. Next, he was Jack
Warden's detective partner in ``Jigsaw John,'' then had a role in
``Looking for Mr. Goodbar.''
   His other series were ``The Runaways,'' ``Family Tree'' and
``Berrenger's.''
   Feinstein also starred in numerous other movies. He was a Zealot
warrior in the miniseries ``Masada.'' He was a gay football player
in ``Alexander: The Other Side of Dawn.'' He was an ex-con in PBS'
``Visions.'' He's never acted in a Western, though he did play Wild
Bill Hickock on stage in ``Fathers and Sons.''
   ``As a kid I never watched the cartoons,'' he said. ``I watched
Lash LaRue, `Range Rider,' Crash Corrigan and `Rough Riders.' I did
a lot of daydreaming and play-acting. At the age of 7 my ambition
was to be a cowboy in the movies.''
   Feinstein, who spends his off hours painting, has some of his
work on display at a local gallery. ``I paint in acrylics, and my
work tends to look like a collage,'' he said. ``I paint objects
that tend to be three-dimensional.''

   The disaster expert whose crew saved two
Montana towns from last summer's Yellowstone firestorms now is
plotting to defend another national park against the largest oil
spill in U.S. history.
   ``Our mission is to find out where the marine wildlife and sea
birds are today, then set priorities so the oil that kills them can
try to be contained,'' said Dave Liebersbach, a veteran Bureau of
Land Management troubleshooter whose title is incident commander.
   Liebersbach's team has found similarities here to Yellowstone.
   ``In Yellowstone we put firefighters on the ground. Here we're
providing logistics for Ph.D. biologists who we're handling as a
very intelligent resource, very delicately. If they need a boat we
get one, if they need a ham sandwich we make one. What they need we
try to provide,'' Liebersbach said.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef near Valdez on Good Friday
night and bled 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince
William Sound. Huge fingers of the slick are now extending westward
through Montague Strait toward the 660,501-acre Kenai Fjord
National Park.
   The oil was less than 10 miles offshore from Seward on Sunday
night, but calm seas and gentle breezes made its future course
unpredictable.
   ``It's possible it could miss everything here,'' said
Liebersbach, ``but to ignore it would be totally negligent. Knowing
what we do, we have to prepare to mitigate it.''
   Created by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act
of 1980, the new national park is a necklace of bird rookeries,
tidal pools, and whale playgrounds draped along 610 miles of the
Kenai Peninsula's eastern coastline.
   Located 100 air miles southeast of Anchorage, most of the park
can be reached only by floatplane or boat. It attracted fewer than
60,000 hardy tourists last year, and is more hospitable to its
critters than its visitors.
   Among the animals who cavort in the midnight sun amid the rugged
grandeur of the park's coves and inlets are many endangered
Humpback and California gray whales, a few endangered Fin whales,
and otters, sea lions, and seals.
   Liebersbach is in charge of a 40-member-and-growing team of
pilots, support personnel, and environmental experts drawn from
Alaska agencies, the U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service,
Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Although Liebersbach's home is Fairbanks, he was at a meeting of
the government's 18 Class 1 disaster incident commanders in Reno,
Nev., when his permanent eight-man core unit was activated at the
request of the park service.
   ``The last time we were together was Yellowstone, on the Storm
Creek fire,'' said Liebersbach. ``We didn't expect to see each
other again until summer.''
   Last August and September, he was boss to several thousand
civilian and military firefighters who faced down 200-foot walls of
flame threatening to incinerate Silver Gate and Cooke City, Mont.
The two towns were saved but Yellowstone's fires charred nearly one
million acres.
   Marvin Robertson, the team's planning chief, said the spill
``woke us all up and got us ready for the year. It looks like it
could be a long one.''
   The team set up shop in a small house near park headquarters in
Seward. Up went the topographical maps. In came the photocopy
machine, typewriters, and coffeemaker. Seven phone lines now ring
constantly from dawn until midnight.
   ``An oil slick is like a fire line, it just keeps moving,'' said
Robertson.

<TEXT>
   A group of leading Latin American writers,
artists and scholars has told President Jose Sarney of Brazil he
will bear ``historical responsibility'' for continued destruction
of the Amazon rain forest.
   ``We believe that the historical responsibility for destroying
the Amazon jungle is very great, and future generations of Latin
Americans will not forgive it if everything possible is not done to
avoid it,'' the Group of 100 warned un a letter, which was released
Monday.
   Sarney has rejected international criticism of the deforestation
of the Amazon basin as foreign interference in Brazilian affairs.
   The Group of 100 declared that ``to invoke national sovereignty
to justify crimes against nature _ like those being committed
against one of the richest and most complex ecosystems on Earth _
appears puerile and dishonest to us.''
   The group condemned ``criminal burning that razes millions of
acres of tropical forests, the clearing of the jungle for
colonization and transnational agriculture'' and ``the
extermination of ethnic groups whose members are hunted down by the
`modernizers' of agriculture to take over their lands.''
   The letter, signed by 28 leading Latin American writers and
artists, was delivered to the Brazilian Embassy by group president
and poet Homer Aridjis.
   Among its signatories are Carlos Fuentes of Mexico, Gabriel
Garcia Marquez of Colombia, Juan Carlos Onetti of Uruguay, Isabel
Allende, widow of the slain Chilean President Salvador Allende,
Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru and Ernesto Sabato of Argentina.

   The Museum of State Security displays the scorched
tail of a small plane, plastic explosives, a tattered 2506 Brigade
armband, assault rifles, a radio transmitter and a battered water
can with a label in English.
   The artifacts are part of what Cuba presents as its 30-year
struggle with the Central Intelligence Agency and dissident Cubans
accused of trying to kill or overthrow President Fidel Castro.
   The museum, which opened this weekend, occupies a refurbished
mansion in a once-wealthy neighborhood whose villas now house
embassies or government offices.
   In a small plaza visible from the street, a power boat with a
black hull, sea blue decks and Florida markings looks at first
glance like a private plaything in a country where such luxuries
are rare.
   Closer examination reveals that the boat, driven by powerful
Mercury engines, has heavy machine guns mounted fore and aft.
   Octavio Cruz, the clean-cut, graying guide at the museum, said
the vessel made coastal raids until it was captured by agents of
the State Security Department, Castro's special police force.
   Maps inside the museum are dotted with sites of ``imperialist
aggression,'' a battle plan for the U.S.-sponsored Bay of Pigs
debacle in 1961. There are a rogue's gallery of people accused of
trying to kill Castro and relics of what is portrayed as a secret
war on the regime he established 30 years ago.
   At the center of an upstairs room, in its own sealed plexiglas
case, is a three-volume set of the yellow-bound proceedings of a
Senate Intelligence Committee investigation of 1975.
   The committee investigation disclosed bungled CIA attempts on
Castro's life _ once with an exploding cigar, for instance, and
another time with poison powder that supposedly was scattered on
the leader's clothing but did no harm.
   Asked why the evidence was not displayed, Cruz first said,
``There have been so many attempts they couldn't all be put in the
museum.'' Later, he said he wasn't sure the evidence still existed.
   He led the visitors into the Hall of Martyrs, lined with
portraits of 88 agents of State Security described as having died
fighting the CIA, Cuban exiles, counterrevolutionaries or other
enemies. A brass plaque beneath each portrait gave the details.
   Cruz said the museum's purpose ``is to bring to the people a
cultural identity and to transmit a story for all visitors
fundamentally about a fight and the atrocities carried out against
us, and the aggressions of the last century.''
   Asked why a meseum opened now to depict events of the 1960s,
Cruz said: ``The opportunity is now'' and, in the past, ``the
revolution had other priorities.''
   In first room of the museum are a giant photo of the U.S. Marine
landing at Santiago de Cuba in 1898, during the Spanish-American
War, and a huge copy of a letter written in 1895 by Jose Marti,
patron saint of Cuban independence. Marti said the United States
would ``continue to use Cuba as a base to extend its power into the
Caribbean.''
   The only other exhibit in that room is an enlargement of a
letter Castro wrote in 1958, from a camp in the hills, telling his
longtime friend and secretary Celia Sanchez: ``They're firing
rockets at us in the mountains. Mario was killed, and the Americans
will pay dearly for this.''
   He also wrote, just a year before gaining power: ``It's becoming
clear to me that this war will go on much longer. It will have to
go on against the Americans.''

   Exxon apologized and promised compensation
for causing the nation's biggest oil spill, which on Monday forced
Alaska to shut down its $12 million herring fishery in Prince
William Sound for the season.
   New York state police, meanwhile, said they expected the
surrender Tuesday of Joseph Hazelwood, the former captain of the
tanker that spilled 10.1 million gallons of North Slope crude after
it crashed into Bligh Reef on March 24.
   ``We have reason to believe he'll present himself'' at the state
police barracks in East Farmingdale, said state police spokesman
Trooper Craig Rubio in a telephone interview Monday evening.
   An arrest warrant has been issued in Alaska for Hazelwood. The
Huntington, N.Y., resident is accused of misdemeanor charges of
operating a ship while under the influence of alcohol, reckless
endangerment and negligent discharge of oil.
   The oil slick has now grown larger than Rhode Island. The state
Fish and Game Department announced Monday that the Prince William
Sound herring fishery, which generates $12 million in annual
revenues, will not open this year. Officials have previously closed
the sound's sablefish and shrimp fisheries.
   More than half the spawning habitat used by Prince William Sound
herring has been fouled, said Dennis Haanpaa, a fisheries biologist
with the department. That bodes ill for both the fish and the
fishermen, who tend to catch herring near their spawning ground.
   Altogether, the Prince William Sound fishing industry is worth
more than $150 million annually.
   In full-page advertisements placed in newspapers around the
country Monday, Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said, ``I want to
tell you how sorry I am that this accident took place.''
   Rawl's statement also appeared to respond to harsh criticism
from Alaskan officials, fishermen and environmentalists who accuse
Exxon of reacting slowly and inadequately to the spill.
   ``We believe that Exxon has moved swiftly and competently to
minimize the effect this oil will have on the environment, fish and
other wildlife,'' he said. Rawl also offered to ``meet our
obligations to all those who have suffered damage from the spill.''
   Four class action lawsuits already have been filed against Exxon
at the outset of what could be years of litigation over the
accident.
   In an interview from the company's headquarters in New York,
Exxon President Lee R. Raymond said he hopes the ``emotional type
of atmosphere'' generated by the spill does not prompt Congress to
reject the oil industry's request to drill in protected wildlife
areas.
   However, that could be precisely the outcome of the spill,
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan suggested in a speech to the
National Ocean Industries Association in Washington.
   ``If the image of an uncareful and uncaring industry prevails
among the U.S. public, then we can kiss goodbye the domestic oil
and gas development in (the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge),
offshore and in the public lands,'' Lujan said.
   More than 1,000 seabirds and at least 20 sea otters caught in
the oil have died, some found covered with asphalt-hard oil.
Officials said the death toll is probably much higher, but they
have had time to survey only a slice of the sound's 2,500 miles of
coastline.
   Department of Fish and Game spokesman Jon Lyman said Monday a
deer found dead on Naked Island about 25 miles southwest of the
tanker had apparently eaten contaminated food, an indication of how
rapidly the spill was spreading.
   ``That's bad news. That's the top of the food chain,'' Lyman
said.
   On nearby Green Island, hundreds of birds lay along the beach,
as black and lifeless as the oil-smeared rocks around them.
Sheltered coves and rocky points, usually clamoring with the sound
of gulls and other shorebirds, were silent.
   ``Every day, it's getting a little worse,'' otter rescue
specialist Chris Donohoe said as he squatted by a dead sea duck.
``You clean a beach up, the tide changes, and the oil comes right
back.''
   Oil is so thick that walking on once postcard-perfect beaches is
treacherous, and workers wear hardhats to protect against injuries
from frequent tumbles on rocks. Oil sprayed by waves splatters
rocks and driftwood logs high above the tideline. Beaches smell
like gas station garages.
   In Sawmill Bay, 11 miles west of Valdez, fishermen said Monday
they battling to keep oil away from 2 million salmon at a hatchery.
A sheen of oil has worked its way inside a plastic boom stretched
across the bay, they said.
   Exxon officials have conceded that beach cleanup efforts so far
have been futile. But the company said it began a new assault with
more effective gear, more workers and a floating command post.
   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi said Exxon planned to
flush beaches by pumping seawater over them, then collect oil from
the water with skimmers.
   ``We intend not to leave until the job is done,'' Iarossi said.
``We intend to leave Prince William Sound close to what it was
before the tragedy.''
   State officials have blasted Exxon's effort to scrub beaches as
dismal and ineffective. Less than 4 percent of the thick crude has
been recovered.
   The spill has fouled more than 800 miles of shoreline in Prince
William Sound, and the amount grows each day.
   Hazelwood, 42, was fired by Exxon last week. The skipper
admitted drinking before boarding the Exxon Valdez, according to
court documents. Blood and urine samples taken nine hours after the
accident indicated he was drunk.
   Larry Weeks, director of criminal prosecution for the state of
Alaska, said authorities in Alaska have had communication with a
lawyer in New York representing Hazelwood.
   The tanker accident forced reductions in the flow of oil through
the Alaskan pipeline, which carries nearly one-quarter of the
United States' domestic supply of crude oil.
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said the flow was increased Sunday
evening with word from the Coast Guard that tanker traffic would
soon be allowed to return to normal.
   However, the Coast Guard decided Monday to reinstate
daytime-only restrictions on oil tanker traffic in Prince William
Sound after state officials raised concerns, spokesman Rick Meidt
said.
   Night traffic was allowed Sunday for the first time since the
Exxon Valdez, one of the two largest tankers in Exxon's U.S. fleet,
ran aground. But after a Monday meeting, the Coast Guard decided to
again limit traffic until all agencies are satisfied that Alyeska,
the operator of the Valdez terminal, has the equipment to handle
another spill, Meidt said.
   ``If something were to happen, let's make sure we have enough
gear there to respond,'' he said.
   The pipeline usually carries 2 million barrels of crude a day.
That had been reduced to 800,000 barrels a day, causing shortages
at West Coast refineries and sending oil prices higher.
   By Monday morning, the pipeline flow had been increased to 1.3
million barrels a day, spokesman John Ratterman said. Pipeline
company officials said they didn't expect the latest restrictions
in tanker traffic to force another cutback in flow.

<TEXT>
   A barge carrying 160,000 gallons of
lye capsized on the Ohio River on Monday, and authorities were
trying to salvage the craft without a major spill, state and
federal officials said.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard said small amounts of a 50
percent lye solution, also known as sodium hydroxide or caustic
soda, could be seeping through vents in the barge.
   ``Common sense tells us, you assume there's some seepage,'' said
Lt. Commander Arthur Adkins of the U.S. Coast Guard at Huntington,
W.Va. ``But none has been detected.''
   Because of its high alkalinity, lye is considered a hazardous
chemical that could endanger aquatic life and drinking water,
officials said.
   The barge, owned by PPG Industries Inc., was one of 15 being
transported by a tugboat around a sharp bend in the Ohio River at
Long Bottom, Ohio, and Murraysville, W.Va. It broke away from the
other vessels and drifted close to the rocky shore before running
aground between Parkersburg and Ravenswood, Adkins said.
   The outer shell of the 195-foot barge was punctured by a rock
shortly before 9 a.m. Monday, Adkins said. The space between the
two hulls flooded and the barge capsized.
   Kemron Laboratories, a Marietta, Ohio, company hired by PPG
Monday to monitor the incident, did not detect an alkalinity
increase in the water surrounding the barge.
   ``It would almost take a catastrophic release to pose a major
threat,'' Adkins said.
   In high concentrations such as the barge is carrying, lye will
burn skin and eyes, Adkins said. Swallowing it can be dangerous, he
said.
   ``Drinking water could be infected, so water intake users
downstream have been notified,'' he said.
   The cleanup and removal of the barge is expected to take several
weeks. PPG's salvage expert from Lake Charles, La., was to arrive
early Tuesday, Adkins said.

   A woman who said she was late for work stole an
ambulance and struck another car before she was stopped, according
to authorities.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said Eduardo Fabregas, who was left
by the road Monday with two other paramedics and a patient who had
complained of respiratory problems.
   ``The truck was rolling right away from us,'' Fabregas said, ``I
thought it was a joke, I thought it was some other fireman pulling
a joke on us, taking it around the corner, or something.''
   The Miami Fire Department ambulance was parked with its motor
running when 32-year-old Aurelia Small jumped in and took off,
police said.
   She sideswiped a station wagon before she was forced off the
road by police about 30 blocks away.
   Ms. Small then told authorities she had stolen the ambulance
because she was in a rush to get to work on time, Miami fire
spokeswoman Vicki Wade said. However, records show the woman has no
job.
   Ms. Small was charged with auto theft, preventing and
obstructing extinguishment of fires, and driving without a license.
   The truck sustained an estimated $1,000 in damage, fire
officials said.
   Another ambulance was dispatched to take the patient to the
hospital.

<HEAD>Milton Boston: Generalissimo of the Capital's Flower Beds</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The capital is awash in laughing daffodils, a
grand chorus of tulips is about to proclaim the arrival of spring,
and Milton Boston already is worrying about planting thousands of
geraniums, petunias and marigolds for the summer.
   Boston is chief floral gardener for the National Park Service in
downtown Washington, the generalissimo with rake and hoe who
oversees the year-long planting of 170 flower beds from the Capitol
to the Kennedy Center.
   His job might seem staggering to backyard putterers. For a month
in late fall, the efficient, unflappable Boston and his crew of
eight gardeners were busy planting 186,150 tulips, 108,300
daffodils and 22,000 pansies, all of which bloom in the spring.
   Those flowers are removed by early May. The soil is tilled,
fumigated with weed and pest killers, conditioned with perlite and
peat moss and planted with bright, hardy annuals for Washington's
hot summer months. They are weeded and fertilized until they die in
the first frost. They are replaced by about 3,000 crysanthemums.
Then the beds are cleared and the cycle starts again in November.
   Boston, a 26-year Park Service veteran, is especially proud of
the ``tulip library,'' a broad, looping cluster of 95 small beds of
the proud clarions of spring that lies near the Tidal Basin south
of the Washington Monument.
   This elaborate garden contains 15,000 tulips, most of them
imported from Holland. Each of the 95 beds containing a different
variety, with names as dazzling as their colors _ Queen of Night,
Merry Widow, Apeldoorn, Oriental Splendor, Smiling Queen, Flaming
Parrot, Estella Rijnveld.
   It's so impressive that it won an admiring tribute from the
Dutch Embassy.
   Boston says he gets ``great satisfaction'' from his handiwork,
which delights more than 23 million tourists who visit Washington's
national parks and monuments each year.
   ``This is always what I wanted to do,'' said Boston, 45, who
grew up on his father's farm in eastern North Carolina and migrated
to Washington after high school. ``All my life I've been used to
growing things.''
   His annual $330,000 budget includes the cost of plants and bulbs
purchased wholesale from growers, many from neighboring Maryland
and Virginia, on the basis of competitive bids and shipped into the
capital by truck or van.
   During plantings, Boston's crew begins work at 6 a.m. and can
leave a flower bed blazing with color before the morning rush hour
is over. He says he couldn't meet his grueling timetable for the
passing seasons without his eight Park Service helpers.
   ``They really work hard and do a good job,'' he said. ``They're
all gardeners, and they know what they're doing. They can plant
20,000 bulbs in one day.''
   In a city beset by violent crimes, Boston is pleased that his
flowers are almost never stolen, except by an occasional panhandler
intent on selling them for spare change.
   ``I guess people enjoy them so, they don't take them,'' he said.
``About the only problem is when people stand in the beds to pose
for pictures and mash the flowers down.''
   Boston says he once had ``the best-looking yard in the
neighborhood'' in suburban Capitol Heights, Md., where he lives
with his wife and two children, ``but in this job, I don't have the
time any more to take care of it.''
   His loss is Washington's gain.

   The government says it will force U.S.
airlines to take stricter anti-terrorism measures, but people who
lost loved ones in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 say the actions
aren't strong enough.
   On the 103rd day after the bombing, the Transportation
Department announced orders requiring devices to detect plastic
explosives and stricter compliance with aviation security warnings,
after Flight 103 relatives met with President Bush.
   The White House meeting on Monday, which was scheduled for 20
minutes but lasted an hour, began a day of emotion-filled
activities at nearby Lafayette Park, Congress and a Washington
church by scores of relatives and friends of the 270 people killed
in the Dec. 21 explosion of the Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The relatives called for a full-scale congressional
investigation ``to determine what and where the breakdowns were''
that led to the ``preventable massacre at 31,000 feet.''
   Bert Ammerman of Demarest, N.J., spokesman for the relatives,
said action announced by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
was ``a positive step forward. We applaud the secretary, (but) it's
not enough.'' Skinner was in the meeting with the relatives and
Bush.
   Ammerman said all checked and carried baggage should be
hand-searched until devices are installed that can detect plastic
explosives such as the one believed to have blown up Flight 103 as
it was headed from London to New York.
   The relatives also proposed better training and pay for airport
inspectors and public disclosure of terrorist threats.
   ``Our loved ones were not given the freedom to make a rational
decision regarding their fate based on all the available facts,''
Ammerman said.
   ``We realize that we will never again be able to laugh, cry or
talk with our loved ones,'' he told several hundred people in the
park. ``But we are determined to do everything in our power to
prevent this senseless and preventable tragedy from occurring
again.''
   Skinner, at a news conference, outlined new orders affecting
U.S. airlines, including required installation of plastic
explosive-detection systems, such as thermal neutron analysis
devices, at high-risk airport throughout the world ``at the
earliest feasible date.''
   The government already has ordered six of the nearly $1 million
machines for installation at various airports before the end of the
year, but Skinner gave no timetable for carrying out the new order,
which would involve 100 or more airports.
   He said it will require some negotiations with foreign
governments. A Federal Aviation Administration official who spoke
on condition of anonymity said it could take years for full
compliance with the order.
   Other steps ordered by Skinner include mandatory airline
acknowledgement and compliance with security bulletins that warn of
possible threats against aviation, an increase in FAA personnel
assigned to key U.S. and foreign airports and upgrading of airport
X-ray equipment.
   Skinner, however, said a public warning system when there are
security threats, saying it would cripple intelligence efforts to
combat terrorists.
   ``We must balance the needs of the American people and the
industry to know with the need to gather meaningful, significant,
relevant information,'' Skinner said.
   He said Bush told relatives he would look into the possibility
of a unified congressional investigation into the explosion. But
Skinner said he would recommend against. He said government
response has been adequate and the FBI and Scotland Yard are
capable of solving the crime.
   The Air Transport Association, which represents major U.S.
airlines, said it supported Skinner's initiatives, but spokesman
Tim Neale said the airlines believe the government, not the
airlines, should pay for new detection equipment from the growing
Aviation Trust Fund.
   Skinner estimated fares might increase from 20 cents to a dollar
per ticket but said the requirements would not cause serious delays.
   The association said any increased security measures should also
apply to foreign airlines which carry about half of the Americans
traveling abroad.

<HEAD>Land Values in Midwest Were Stable Despite Ravages of Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department economist says
federal emergency aid ``probably helped stabilize land values in
the Midwest'' last year after drought ravaged crops across the
region.
   Gregory Hanson of the department's Economic Research Service
said that surveys by the Farm Credit Banks of St. Paul, Minn.,
indicate that land prices did not decline in Michigan, North Dakota
or Wisconsin in June through November last year.
   Other surveys indicate that farmland prices rose in the Corn
Belt in 1988, he said. Real estate is the main source of loan
collateral for farmers.
   ``While drought assistance has helped stabilize the agricultural
economy, the USDA estimates that 10,000 to 15,000 commercial farms
faced loan repayment problems due to crop losses,'' Hanson said.
``These stressed farmers represent 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent of
all commercial farms.''
   The Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 was signed into law last
Aug. 11 as the scorching summer drought was still at its peak. The
law provided up to $3.9 billion in federal aid and other measures
to help farmers recover.
   Hanson, writing in the April issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, said that federal disaster assistance may turn out to be
less than foreseen last fall ``because crop losses were smaller
than expected.''
   ``Also, qualification for drought assistance was based on the
whole-farm average yield for each crop, rather than on a
field-by-field basis,'' he said. ``The averaging-up of yields,
where good fields offset poorer fields, excluded some farmers from
qualifying in areas with scattered rainfall.''
   Even so, Hanson added, the combination of drought assistance and
federal subsidized crop insurance ``has permitted thousands of
farmers in hard-hit states to survive last year's bad weather with
less financial suffering than had been anticipated.''
   Hanson said a full assessment of federal drought aid and
insurance benefits cannot be completed until all payments and
indemnities have been disbursed. But preliminary figures show those
had ``substantial stabilizing effects'' in the hardest-hit drought
areas.
   But on Capitol Hill there have been grumblings that USDA has
mishandled 1988 relief and has ignored drought conditions now
prevailing in parts of the Great Plains, notably in Kansas and
parts of Texas.
   Department officials testified that more than 558,000 producers
had received disaster payments and emergency feed assistance
amounting to more than $2.7 billion nationally.
   In his report, Hanson said that as of early February, more than
$2 billion in drought payments and almost $1 billion in federal
crop insurance benefits had been paid to farmers in the top eight
states.
   Farmers in Montana and the Dakotas _ where more than 80 percent
of the commercial farms were in drought-stricken counties _ have
received nearly a third of the drought payments made so far.
   Benefits paid to the eight states as of early February, in
millions of dollars, included drought aid in the first column,
federal crop insurance in the second, and the total in the third:

   American ketchup makers and other tomato
processors will have a Japanese competitor bidding for farmers'
crops, says an Agriculture Department report.
   The Kogome Co. Ltd., Japan's largest tomato processing company,
announced it will open a $20 million plant next year in Los Banos,
Calif., to manufacture tomato products and fruit juice beverages.
   ``Most, if not all, of the manufactured products likely will be
exported to Japan to take advantage of future market openings for
tomato and fruit drink products achieved under a recent U.S.-Japan
agreement,'' the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said.
   The agreement gives U.S. exporters of 11 product categories,
including processed tomato products and fruit juices, greater sale
opportunities in Japan.
   Bryand H. Wadsworth, U.S. agricultural counselor in Tokyo, said
the plant will produce institutional-size containers tomato ketchup
from tomato paste bought from local manufacturers.
   In addition, he said, the plant will produce retail-size
``fruit-juice added'' drinks such as orange and apple in both
carbonated and non-carbonated form.

   The Agriculture Department says the U.S. dry
bean situation has ``completely reversed'' itself from a year ago
because of higher prices prompted by the 1988 drought.
   By January, the average farm price of dry edible beans was
$29.60 per hundredweight, up from $13.40 a year earlier.
   Price increases were the greatest for beans hit hardest by the
drought. For example, grower prices for navy beans in the week of
Jan. 24 averaged $32 per hundredweight, compared with around $10 in
January 1988, the department's Economic Research Service said.
   Total U.S. output of dry beans dropped 26 percent to 19.2
million hundredweight last year, the agency reported.
   ``The sharpest decreases in production were for red kidney,
pintos and navies, the beans grown in states with less
irrigation,'' the report said.
   Another price factor is an improved outlook for bean exports
because of poor harvests in several major importing countries,
including Mexico and Japan.
   ``Domestic demand for beans could also improve this year because
of recent media attention and industry promotional efforts,'' the
report said. Beans are a nutritious food item and are noted for
their fiber content.

<HEAD>Cornell Says Ethics, Not Security, The Key to Preventing Computer
Worms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethics, not increased security, are the best
defense against computer ``worms'' like the one unleashed last fall
by a Cornell University graduate student, a school official said.
   A special university commission reported Monday that Robert T.
Morris Jr. acted alone and with ``reckless disregard'' on Nov. 2
when he launched a debilitating program into the Internet network,
causing thousands of computers around the country to clog and
overload.
   The commission concluded that Morris did not intend for the worm
to destroy data or files, but that he did want it to spread widely.
   It said the program was not technically a ``virus'' _ a program
that inserts itself into a host program to propagate _ but was a
``worm,'' an independent program that replicates itself once placed
in a computer system.
   Release of the worm was not a ``heroic event that pointed up the
weaknesses of operating systems,'' contrary to Morris' claim, the
commission wrote. The panel also denied that Morris was a genius
for creating the worm. It said although the worm was technically
sophisticated, it could have been created by many students.
   In fact, Morris' ``juvenile act'' did little to provide insights
into the already well-known security flaws of the Internet system,
a national research network used by universities, industry and
government, said M. Stuart Lynn, Cornell's vice president of
technologies.
   Lynn and Cornell Provost Robert Barker said the incident's
greatest impact was the breach of trust it had caused among
researchers who use the network. However, both cautioned that
employing drastic security steps was not a solution to prevent
similar incidents.
   ``Violations of such a trust cannot be condoned,'' said Lynn.
``A community of scholars shouldn't have to build sky-high walls in
order to protect a reasonable expectation of privacy _ particularly
when such walls would impede the free flow of information and
ideas.''
   Lynn added that it's unlikely any security steps could guarantee
an impenetrable system ``in a community of individuals possessed of
all the knowledge and skills required to scale the highest
barriers.''
   Instead, the Cornell officials stressed the need for improved
awareness of computer ethics, said Lynn.
   ``I don't think one can ever feel confident by putting bigger
and tighter locks on the door,'' said Lynn. ``That's why it's
important to stress ethical considerations.''
   Morris, who is on a leave of absence from school, declined to be
interviewed by the commission, which was left to speculate as to
the reasons he created the ``worm.''
   The panel made no recommendation about disciplinary action
against the first-year graduate student in Cornell's doctoral
computer program. Barker said Morris' case would be reviewed by a
panel of graduate students and faculty that could permanently bar
him from the university.
   Morris, 23, of Arnold, Md., remains under investigation by a
federal grand jury in Syracuse and the Justice Department in
Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>Billy Budd Revived at Met</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The expanding shipboard set that dominates
Benjamin Britten's ``Billy Budd'' at the Metropolitan Opera is so
spectacular that the work would almost be worth reviving just for
the chance to see it in action.
   Luckily, there was also quite a bit of a musical nature to hold
the interest Monday night when the company presented the John
Dexter production for the first time in several seasons.
   Herman Melville's classic tale revolves around three sharply
drawn characters who inspired some of Britten's most memorable
music: Billy Budd, the good and handsome sailor; John Claggart, the
evil master-at-arms who is bent on his destruction; and Edward
Vere, the philosophical captain who reluctantly sends Billy to his
death to preserve law and order.
   Two of the three roles were in excellent hands. Baritone Thomas
Allen made a first-rate Billy, conveying first his youth and
enthusiasm and later his pathos when, chained and awaiting
execution, he sings a haunting ballad. As Vere, tenor James King
made a moving figure, especially in the prologue and epilogue where
he appears as an old man musing about the distant past.
   Another composer might have made Billy a tenor, the vocal part
traditionally associated with a young hero. But in Melville's
ambiguous narrative, Captain Vere may be the real hero, and
Britten's decision to make him the tenor seems to acknowledge this.
   The malevolent Claggart is portrayed more conventionally as a
deep bass. Jan-Hendrik Rootering looked sinister enough, but his
good-sized voice lacked the bite and menace that James Morris
brought to the part when the production was new.
   The men's chorus, which has a major role in the all-male cast,
performed lustily, and the orchestra played well under conductor
Thomas Fulton.
   But it was above all the set, designed by William Dudley, that
commanded admiration. With the aid of the Met's elaborate system of
stage elevators, the ship expands and shrinks like an accordion as
the action shifts from the main-deck, to the captain's cabin, to
the quarter-deck, to the lower gun-deck.
   The effect is fittingly to make the ship itself the dominant
image in the opera, a microcosm where the battle between good and
evil is played out to its tragic conclusion.

<HEAD>Death Penalty Opponents Pressing D.C. Mayor To Block Extradition
Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Opponents of capital punishment are pressing
District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry to block the extradition of
a juvenile sought by Alabama until he's assured the youth won't
face the death penalty.
   But Barry so far has refused to interject himself publicly into
the extradition case involving a 17-year-old black youth charged in
the May 1988 firebombing of a Gadsden, Ala., apartment. A
14-month-old black child died in the fire.
   Rick Blake, the mayor's deputy press secretary, said Barry would
not respond to pleas, made at a Monday news conference by a group
of death penalty opponents and church leaders, that he refuse to
honor Alabama's extradition request unless state authorities
guarantee the youth, identified by the initials O.M., will not be
charged with a capital crime.
   While Barry has remained silent, lawyers for the district
government have supported Alabama's bid to extradite the youth, who
has been held in Washington since his arrest in December on a
fugitive warrant from Alabama.
   Superior Court Judge Stephen F. Eilperin last week granted
Alabama's extradition request, but he stayed his order until today
to allow the youth's attorneys to appeal. An appeal was filed
Friday with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which
extended the stay until April 10.
   Alvin J. Bronstein, director of the National Prison Project of
the American Civil Liberties Union, said Barry can supersede the
court ruling and block the extradition until Alabama promises not
to seek the death penalty.
   Bronstein charged that Barry, by allowing his government to
support the extradition, has ``forgotten the values that motivated
him 25 years ago'' when he worked for racial justice in the South
as a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).
   Bronstein, who was an attorney for SNCC members during the civil
rights movement, said he was issuing ``a personal plea to the mayor
... don't send this youngster back without the kinds of guarantees
that will ensure us that he won't be killed in jail, that he will
be treated in a decent fashion and that he won't face the death
penalty.''
   If Alabama refuses to make such guarantees, then Bronstein said
the district should release the youth, because there are no other
outstanding charges against him.
   O.M.'s attorneys contend he cannot get a fair trial from the
white authorities of Etowah County, Ala., because of their
long-standing vendetta against his family. Both the boy's father
and uncle died while in police custody.
   Another of the boy's uncles has been charged with murder and
arson in connection with the 1988 firebombing. O.M. is charged
under juvenile law as an accessory to the firebombing, and thus is
not facing an immediate threat of the death penalty.
   But Alabama authorities have refused to rule out the possiblity
that he might be tried as an adult and subjected to the death
penalty.

   President Bush scoffs at the notion that his
season-opening pitch to Orioles' catcher Mickey Tettleton was a
high and wide. ``He caught it before it started breaking,'' Bush
protests.
   With guest Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and a sellout
Memorial Stadium crowd of 52,161 watching, Bush tossed the first
ball in Monday's American League opener between Baltimore and the
Boston Red Sox.
   Bush, captain of the 1948 Yale baseball team and an enthusistic
lifetime fan, threw the ball lefthanded from the mound. Standing in
his shirtsleeves with his jacket removed and a glove on his right
hand, Bush hurled the ball without benefit of a windup.
   Tettleton, who had moved several feet in front of home plate for
the presidential pitch, gloved the curve ball with a long reach
over his right shoulder.
   Over hot dogs, hamburgers and soft drinks, Bush discussed that
pitch _ his first game-opener as president _ with Mubarak and other
guests and reporters in his glass-enclosed box over third base,
voicing mock dismay over a reporter's suggestion that it was ``high
and outside.''
   Turning to baseball great Ted Williams, a longtime Bush friend,
Bush said: ``Here's an objective judge. What did you think, sir?''
After a pause, Williams said: ``High, hard, fast ball.''
   Bush then asked ``another objective visitor,'' baseball
commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. ``Superb,'' Giamatti said,
adding he hadn't seen the pitch but had heard about it from
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who ``said it was
wonderful.''
   Bush and Muburak left after the fifth inning, when Baltimore led
1-0, missing most of the action. The final score was Baltimore 5,
Red Sox 4 in 11 innings.
   Mubarak, putting on an Orioles hat for photogrpahers, said he
was enjoying both his hot dog lunch and his first live baseball
game, calling Bush ``a very good teacher.''
   ``He was the captain of the biggest team in the United States,''
Mubarak said.
   ``That's what I told him,'' Bush interjected.
   At Yale, first baseman Bush was known more for his fielding than
his hitting.
   Bush was asked if Monday's game brought back memories from his
youth. ``This was fun, yeah,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Use of Drug Courier `Profiles'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Law enforcement officials are armed with new
support from the Supreme Court to fight drug smuggling by air
travelers.
   The justices on Monday made it easier for authorities to stop,
question and search airline passengers who fit so-called
``profiles'' of possible drug couriers.
   By a 7-2 vote, the court ordered the reinstatement of a drug
possession conviction of a man carrying 1,000 grams of cocaine when
he was stopped by authorities at the Honolulu airport.
   ``We're pleased and happy that we've been upheld by the Supreme
Court,'' said Cornelius Dougherty, spokesman for the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   The justices upheld the DEA's case against Andrew Sokolow, who
was stopped because his behavior and dress matched a ``profile''
the agency uses to identify suspected drug couriers.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
there were sufficient factors to lead agents to reasonably suspect
Sokolow was engaged in criminal activity.
   ``The fact that these factors may be set forth in a `profile'
does not somehow detract from their evidentiary significance as
seen by a trained agent,'' Rehnquist said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall said the
ruling likely will lead to questioning and detaining innocent
people.
   ``Reflexive reliance on a profile of drug courier
characteristics runs a far greater risk than does ordinary,
case-by-case police work of subjecting innocent individuals to
unawarranted police harassment and detention,'' he said.
   Marshall was joined by Justice William J. Brennan.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh hailed the ruling, saying it
``validates an effective practice ... to crack down on drug
trafficking.''
   ``Without this tool, our anti-drug effort could be significantly
hampered,'' Thornburgh said in a statement. ``By upholding the
`profile' practice, the Supreme Court has struck a strong blow in
support of law enforcement's war on drugs.''
   Sokolow was stopped by DEA agents on July 25, 1984, as he
returned to Hawaii from a trip to Miami.
   Authorities said he aroused their suspicions three days earlier
when he and a female companion departed from Honolulu airport for
Miami.
   They said Sokolow, who appeared to be in his mid-20s, bought his
plane tickets with $2,100 in cash taken from a roll of money that
appeared to contain more than $4,000. He was wearing a black
jumpsuit and a great deal of gold jewelry, appeared nervous, and he
and the woman with him carried four handbags on the plane without
checking any luggage.
   The agents also suspected he was using an alias because the name
he gave the ticket agent was not the same as the name listed for
the telephone number he gave the agent.
   Such behavior, dress and demeanor fit the profile of a drug
courier, narcotics agents said.
   Sokolow pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute and was sentenced to five years in prison. He appealed
the conviction on grounds the cocaine should have been suppressed
as evidence because authorities violated his constitutional rights
against unlawful search and seizure when they stopped him in
Honolulu.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the conviction,
ruling that suspicion of a crime ``cannot be intuited from a
hodgepodge assembly of factors about individual character.''
   But the Supreme Court said the accumulated factors weighed by
the agents were enough to permit them to question Sokolow and
detain him. They subsequently obtained a search warrant after a
police dog indicated a handbag contained narcotics.
   ``Any one of these factors is not by itself proof of any illegal
conduct and is quite consistent with innocent travel,'' Rehnquist
said. ``But we think taken together they amount to reasonable
suspicion.''
   For example, Rehnquist said, traveling from Hawaii to Miami may
not be suspicious. But, he said, ``Surely few residents of Honolulu
travel from that city for 20 hours to spend 48 hours in Miami
during the month of July.''
   The use of drug courier profiles has survived previous high
court scrutiny. Monday's ruling may give authorities a freer hand
to use them.
   In other action, the court:
   _Ruled in a case from Dallas that there is no ``generalized
right of social association'' and allowed communities to protect
young teen-agers by banning anyone over 18 from some dance halls.
   _Ruled, by a 6-3 vote in a Mississippi case, that state courts
lack the authority to approve adoptions of Indian babies by
non-Indians even when the natural parents leave the reservation to
give up the children.
   Sending the case back to a tribal court for more study, the
justices said tribal rights and Indian culture take precedence over
individual rights in such circumstances.
   _Agreed to decide whether a Baltimore woman may be jailed for
refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her young son, who
authorities fear may be dead.

   The hazelnut rolled past the giant chinquapin
on the way to becoming the official state nut.
   The Senate Government Operations and Elections Committee on
Monday passed the hazelnut on to the full Senate for consideration.
   The only person to testify in favor of the giant chinquapin, a
cousin of the chestnut, was John Pope, a Salem seed company owner
and nature lover who admitted that legislators might consider his
favored nut ``squirrel food.''
   He was no match against 10 members of the Slick Chick Camp Fire

million hazelnut industry.
   ``Indians and pioneers ate hazelnuts,'' said troop member Sarah

   Only one committee member voted against the hazelnut, also known
as filberts.
   ``I'm not convinced this was an issue we need to address,'' said
Sen. Dick Springer.

<HEAD>Teachers' Union Says $10 Billion More Needed For School Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest teachers union today
called for $10 billion in new federal spending to counter ``a
shocking erosion'' in education programs for the disadvantaged and
handicapped.
   ``These programs reach only a fraction of the young people they
were meant to serve,'' Mary Futrell, president of the National
Education Association, said in issuing a report called ``Federal
Education Funding: Present Realities and Future Needs.''
   ``In state after state, the numbers in our new report clearly
demonstrate a shocking erosion of federal support for these
essential programs,'' Futrell said in a statement. ``Nothing could
be more impractical for our nation than continuing this systematic
underfunding.''
   Futrell said the NEA report contains the first estimates of what
it would cost to serve all students currently eligible for help
under four of the most important federal education programs.
   NEA has more than 1.9 million members across the country. Its
report comes as Congress prepares to tackle the fiscal 1990 budget.
   The report looks specifically at Chapter 1, grants to bolster
basic skills among disadvantaged youngsters; the Education for All
Handicapped Act, which helps states educate disabled youngsters;
bilingual education, grants to make sure students with native
languages other than English succeed in school; and Pell grants for
college students from low-income families.
   The most serious erosion appears to have occurred in Chapter 1.
The NEA report said the number of students served dropped from 7
million in 1980-81 to 5.7 million in 1988-89. At the same time the
number of children in poverty swelled, so while the program reached
65 percent of eligible students in 1980-81, it reached only 40
percent by 1986.
   For fiscal 1989, the group said, Congress provided $4.6 billion
for Chapter 1 _ enough to serve 47 percent of eligible students. To
serve the estimated 8.5 million who will qualify next year, would
cost about $6.9 billion _ a $2.3 billion increase over current
levels.
   The authors of the 1974 handicapped act intended that the
federal government would ultimately pay 40 percent of its cost to
local school districts. But the federal share started at 12 percent
and stayed there until 1980, and by fiscal 1989 had dropped to 7
percent, NEA said.
   To reach the 40 percent target would cost $8.4 billion, a $6.5
billion hike over current levels, the report said. And though
funding has doubled since 1980, merely restoring the federal share
to 12 percent would cost an extra $700 million.
   The bilingual education program currently serves one in 18 of
students who need help in English language skills, NEA said. An
increase of more than $1 billion would be needed to serve the 1.6
million students states report as eligible, the group said.
   While funds for Pell grants have increased slightly when
adjusted for inflation, the increases have not come near matching
the soaring costs of postsecondary education, NEA said. It also
said Congress has ``fallen far short'' of meeting its own
authorized funding level for the individual grants. Another $600
million would be needed to fully fund the maximum $2,900 Pell
grants permitted in fiscal 1990, the teacher union said.
   Higher academic standards and a greater emphasis on analysis and
problem-solving are ``doomed to failure unless schools and
communities can maintain programs to help all students meet those
standards,'' the report said. It says the solution, given state and
local economic constraints, is to fully restore the federal share
of support for public education.
   The NEA report was based on charts provided by Federal Planning
Services Inc. of Washington D.C., an independent statistical
analysis firm.

<HEAD>Bush Seeks $2.2 Billion in New 1989 Spending, $829 Million in Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that lobbies for poor people says
President Bush's proposal to immediately slash $829 million in
domestic spending would fall heavily on the needy.
   Bush is asking Congress to make the reductions to help pay for
$2.2 billion in new 1989 spending he is seeking in other areas,
including funds for veterans and for foster care.
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an advocacy group
for the needy, said that based on its analysis of Bush's proposal,
$270 million in cuts would come from programs that provide
education, job training, health and other assistance to the poor.
   ``The priorities reflected in these proposals raise questions
about whether the talk of a kinder and gentler America largely
represents a rhetorical attempt at image-making,'' said the
center's director, Robert Greenstein, in a written statement.
   Under Bush's plan, more than 1,000 domestic programs _ excluding
those he considers top priority _ would be slashed by nearly 1.1
percent across the board.
   The details of Bush's request, made available by the House
Appropriations Committee and the White House's Office of Management
and Budget, did not specify which programs would be affected by the
proposed cuts.
   But the center, saying it based its figures on data from OMB,
said $270 million of the proposed cuts would come from programs for
the poor. The center said this would include $64 million in cuts in
financial aid to needy students, $50 million for compensatory
education for poor children, and $41 million for job training.
   Overall, the center said, the sharpest cuts would fall on the
departments of education, $185 million; health and human services,
$88 million; and agriculture, $80 million.
   The savings from the cuts Bush is seeking would help finance
increases the president wants in dozens of domestic programs for
fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. Even though most budget decisions
are made before a fiscal year begins, presidents often seek
additional spending in the middle of the year.
   Included in Bush's request for new spending is about $850
million to pay for cost-of-living increases for veterans and their
survivors and for other Department of Veterans Affairs programs.
   The president is also seeking $400 million to repay states for
their foster care efforts, $100 million to pay for increased
refugees entering this country from the Soviet Union, Africa and
Southeast Asia, and $55 million for the government's uranium
program.
   In addition, Bush is asking Congress to provide $892 million it
has already committed itself to spending for the Guaranteed Student
Loan program for college students.
   Bush sent his request to Congress on March 24, when lawmakers
were on their Easter recess. They return Tuesday.
   In his package, Bush told the lawmakers he would later submit a
request for about $50 million in aid to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels, and $454 million to help bail out the nation's teetering
savings and loan associations.

   Congress this week celebrates a curious but
important milestone: The 200th anniversary of the days on which the
first House and first Senate achieved a quorum and were finally
ready to begin the work of the new nation.
   The House marks the occasion today, April 4, three days after
the actual April 1 anniversary. The Senate celebrates on Thursday,
April 6, the actual date of its first working quorum.
   Commemorative postage stamps will be issued honoring the
bicentennials of both houses.
   The Congress established under the Constitution first convened
in New York City on March 4, 1789.
   But the absence of the required majority plus one prevented the
two chambers from getting down to business.
   On that first day only 13 of the 59 House members and only eight
of the 22 senators were in attendance.
   Election complications, bad weather, muddy roads and just plain
sloth get the blame as causes for the delay.
   The journal of the House noted with monotonous regularity that
``a quorum of the members not being present, the House adjourned.''
   Congress under the discarded Articles of Confederation had been
noted for absenteeism and near paralysis, and many feared history
was about to repeat itself.
   ``We lose credit, spirit, everything,'' Rep. Fisher Ames of
Massachusetts wrote to a friend in Boston. ``The public will forget
the government before it is born.''
   The senators who had managed to reach New York wrote to their
absent colleagues: ``We apprehend that no arguments are necessary
to evince to you the indispensable necessity of putting the
government into immediate operation and, therefore ernestly request
that you will be so obliging as to attend as soon as possible.''
   George Washington had been elected the nation's first president,
but could not enter office until the Senate achieved a quorum and
met to count the ballots of the Electoral College.
   From Mount Vernon he grumbled that senators and House members
were in a state of ``stupor or listlessness.''
   But eventually the required numbers assembled.
   The House, counting its first quorum on April 1 _ April Fool's
Day some have noted _ elected Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg of
Pennsylvania as its first speaker.
   And Fisher Ames, much mollified now that work could begin, said
he was pleased with his new colleagues.
   While there were few ``shining geniuses,'' he said, there were
many who had ``experience, the virtues of the heart, and habits of
business.''
   On April 6 the Senate counted its first quorum.
   The first order of business: Counting the votes of the electors
and dispatching messengers to inform Washington and John Adams that
they had indeed been chosen president and vice president.

   The postage stamp honoring the Senate will display the gilt
shield and eagle suspended over the presiding officer's chair in
the Capitol's Old Senate Chamber, in use from 1810 to 1859.
   The stamp honoring the House of Representatives features the
fanciful ``Car of History,'' a winged marble chariot which, since
1819, has borne the carved figure of Clio, the muse of history,
over the floor of the Old House Chamber, now Statuary Hall.
   Rep. John Quincy Adams, who served 17 years in the House after
his single term as president, was inspired in 1840 to dedicate a
poem to the muse who is shown recording in a book the events
unfolding on the floor of the legislative body below.
   Often at odds with his colleagues and irritated by their
conduct, Adams paid tribute to the muse for putting up with the
``wordy war'' conducted by the members.
   There was wit, there was wisdom, he acknowledged. But there was
also ``the conflicting jar of ranting, raving parties, day and
night ...''
   Adams concluded:
   ``Oh! Muse historic _ in thy march sublime
   Still urging onward on the wheels of time.
   Canst thou not whisper to the chosen band
   But for one day to calm their senseless rage,
   And let thy volume bear one blessed page
   Of deeds devoted to their native land.''

<TEXT>
   The Senate Banking Committee's proposal for
solving the savings and loan crisis waters down key sections of
President Bush's reform plan but also hands industry lobbyists
several defeats, according to a committee document.
   The proposal would make a number of changes sought by S&amp;L
executives regarding deposit insurance, regulatory structure and
capital requirements.
   However, other provisions, such as those restricting commercial
real estate lending and strengthening the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., are less favorable to the industry than Bush's Feb. 6
proposal.
   The document, obtained Monday by The Associated Press, was
prepared for closed-door meetings of the Senate panel starting
today. It outlines the recommendations of the staff of Sen. Donald
W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., the committee chairman.
   The panel plans three private sessions this week in preparation
for public bill-drafting sessions beginning April 13. Meanwhile,
Democrats on the House Banking Committee plan a private strategy
session Wednesday, before the first open meeting on Thursday.
   Among the victories for the S&amp;L industry in the Senate proposal
are recommendations to:
   _Equalize deposit insurance premiums for banks and S&amp;Ls by the
year 2000. The Bush proposal, after a series of changes, would
charge S&amp;Ls 18 cents per $100 for their insurance versus 15 cents
per $100 for commercial banks.
   _Give the Treasury Department less control over S&amp;L regulators
than proposed by the administration.
   _Allow some weak S&amp;Ls to grow modestly after the June 1991
deadline for meeting tougher capital standards. Bush would prohibit
S&amp;Ls from expanding if their owners did not meet stricter
requirements on how much money they must put up to back their
institutions' loans. The Senate proposal also would give S&amp;Ls twice
as long, 20 years versus 10 years, to meet tougher standards on a
portion of capital known as goodwill.
   _Prohibit the government from hurting regional real estate
markets by selling repossessed property from failed S&amp;Ls too
quickly. It would add real estate expertise to the new government
board overseeing S&amp;L bailouts by expanding the board from three
government officials to five members, including two private
business persons.
   As expected, the Senate proposal would count S&amp;L rescue spending
``on-budget,'' as opposed to the complex administration plan for
keeping $50 billion in S&amp;L spending out of the budget deficit.
   Meanwhile, in a separate development, commercial banks sought
guarantees that they would get refunds of deposit insurance
premiums once the bank insurance fund regained its full strength of
$1.25 in reserves for every $100 in deposits, up from a depleted 80
cents per $100 now.
   The administration has said rebates could begin by the
mid-1990s, but the Bush bill allows regulators to decide whether or
not to offer them and FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman wants that
flexibility until the insurance fund reaches a level of $1.65 per
$100. Banking groups, led by the American Bankers Association, want
to make rebates automatic after the fund reaches the $1.25 level.
   In at least three respects, the Senate proposal would hand a
defeat to S&amp;L lobbyists:
   _Although the Senate would allow the S&amp;L regulatory agency, the
Federal Home Loan Bank System, greater independence from the
administration, it would transfer some of the bank system's most
important powers, such as setting capital and accounting standards
and supervising state-chartered S&amp;Ls, to the FDIC.
   _Current law and the administration plan permits S&amp;Ls to invest
as much as 40 percent of their assets in commercial real estate.
Under the Senate proposal, all but the healthiest S&amp;Ls would have
stricter limits.
   _Greater limits on activities would be permitted to
state-chartered S&amp;Ls, but forbidden to S&amp;Ls with federal charters.
   Other significant changes offered by the Senate include:
   _Removal of a section of the administration bill that could undo
many of the S&amp;L rescues put together by regulators last year.
   _Fixed terms for the chairman and members of the FDIC. The
administration wants the president to have the power to dismiss the
FDIC chairman.
   _Removal of tougher accounting standards for credit unions. A
dispute over the administration's proposal for that industry had
threatened to delay the S&amp;L package.

   The United States is challenging the world's
democratic powers to move quickly and put in motion the Bush
administration's plan for easing the Third World's politically
explosive debt burden.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's proposals to ease the
seven-year-old debt crisis were slated for a final review today
from the executive committee of the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank.
   Some participants at the spring meeting of the two organizations
have expressed concerns that unless action is taken on the Brady
plan, political unrest could be unleashed in the fragile
democracies of Latin America where the huge debt burden has
depressed living standards for most of this decade.
   At least 270 people were killed in riots in Venezuela in
February after the goverment imposed a new austerity program to
satisfy creditors.
   Brady, in an address on Monday, told the organizations it was
time ``to turn these concepts into specifics which provide a basis
for lasting progress in dealing with the debt problem.''
   Brady's scheme marks a sharp turn from past U.S. policy because
it seeks for the first time to reduce the $1.3 trillion Third World
debt by getting commercial banks to voluntarily forgive part of
their loans.
   Although America's allies were not in total agreement with every
element of the plan, Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson
predicted it would receive general approval.
   He told reporters that although much discussion had gone on
about the technical problems of putting the plan in motion, ``there
are no serious objections that have been put forward.''
   The plan got a major boost on Monday when the Japanese stepped
forward with a pledge to provide up to $4.5 billion in new loans to
Third World debtors over the next several years. The funds,
however, did not match the widely anticipated $5 billion to $10
billion expected from the Tokyo government.
   Brady also had been counting on other countries running large
trade surpluses, such as West Germany, to recycle a part of their
wealth into increased aid for developing nations.
   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson made clear
there were some doubts about how completely the U.S. plan would be
adopted, saying its proposal to use World Bank and IMF resources to
guarantee interest payments raised ``all sorts of problems.''
   Lawson said the time had come for the commercial banks who had
made the loans to do more to resolve the crisis by writing off debt
without trying to shift the burden onto the backs of the
international lending organizations.
   The IMF and World Bank are supported by taxpayer funds from the
151-member countries, but the United States is the largest
contributor.
   ``What I do not find acceptable is the idea that our taxpayers
should bail out the commercial banks,'' Lawson told reporters at a
briefing.
   The two large international lending agencies have a key role to
play in the plan because they would be expected to put up about $12
billion each to guarantee to the banks that the remaining part of
the debt or the annual interest payments would be repaid.
   The administration won general approval for its new approach
from its six largest allies on Sunday, but the communique issued by
the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and
Italy promised only to ``examine'' the question of guaranteeing
interest payments to the banks.
   The Group of Seven's communique was more supportive of the less
costly idea of guaranteeing the reduced level of debt.
   Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega, finance minister of Brazil, the
largest Third World debtor with $110 billion owed, praised the
Brady initiative, calling it a ``major conceptual breakthrough''
with success depending on ``our capacity to move quickly and far
enough.''
   ``These new ideas raise new hopes,'' he said in his comments to
the IMF steering group. ``They should be translated into immediate
action. It is crucial that such new hopes do not give place to new
frustrations.''

   Actress Jill Ireland has been released
from the hospital ``fighting for her life'' against lung cancer,
her publicist said.
   Miss Ireland entered St. Johns Medical Center in Santa Monica
last week for a fever associated with chemotherapy and was released
Sunday to recuperate at her Malibu home, spokeswoman Lori Jonas
said.
   Miss Ireland was still scheduling interviews to promote ``Life
Lines,'' a Warner Books release about coping with adversity that is
due in stores April 24, her 53rd birthday.
   The actress, who lost her right breast to cancer in 1984,
learned last summer the disease had returned. At the time, she
confessed to being scared and angry, but said she no longer felt
alone because of the support from her actor-husband, Charles
Bronson.
   Miss Ireland, who wrote the best-selling book ``Life Wish''
about her battle with cancer, said she had a localized malignancy
in her lymph nodes. Last month, Miss Jonas confirmed Miss Ireland
suffered a setback.
   ``She's fighting for her life. She's got lung cancer,'' Miss
Jonas said Monday.

   Singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson
and his wife, Lisa, want to fulfill a promise they made to their
children's nanny, who was shot to death by her estranged husband.
   The Kristoffersons, parents of three young children, would like
permanent custody of the nanny's three girls, ages 4 to 12.
   Maria Juana Aguilar, 32, asked two years ago that the singer and
his wife take care of her children should anything happen to her.
The Kristoffersons were awarded temporary guardianship a year ago.
   But relatives of Ricardo Arauz now want guardianship of the two
youngest girls, fathered by Arauz.
   Kristofferson said in court documents he wants to provide a
warm, loving, supportive and stable home environment for the
children of his Salvadoran housekeeper of 10 years.
   A hearing was scheduled for May 3.
   Arauz, 38, shot and killed the housekeeper a year ago at the Los
Angeles home of a relative. Arauz pleaded guilty March 17 to
second-degree murder and faces 17 years to life in state prison
when sentenced April 21.

   The divorced title character on NBC's ``Dear
John'' should stay out of singles clubs and shop for companionship
in supermarkets and self-service laundries, author Herbert Gold
says.
   John Lacey, played by Judd Hirsch, makes ``the same mistakes
every suddenly single (that is, ignominiously dumped) 40-ish male
makes,'' said Gold, also a former husband.
   This season, John even got involved with a 17-year-old student.
``Did you forget that you have fillings in your teeth older than
she is?'' Gold asked in this week's TV Guide magazine.
   Then there was a lamentable Christmas Eve with his
eightysomething neighbor and his timid response to a pass from an
attractive congressional candidate.
   Gold advises Lacey to stop wallowing in the past, to get rid of
his ``Columbo'' raincoat and to give up on personal ads.
   At a supermarket, ``one glance in the shopping cart will tell
you if the woman is for it,'' he said. ``If she fills her cart with
Pampers, chances are she's not available.''
   On the other hand, if she has a lot of small cans of caviar,
``it's a safe bet that there's a good job or inherited money
somewhere in the picture.''

   Art collector Ethel Scull was fined $1,000 and
given a conditional discharge of a one-year jail sentence for her
guilty plea to harassing her stock broker after the 1987 market
crash.
   The 67-year-old socialite was charged with aggravated harassment
for making 1,208 telephone calls in one week in January 1988 to
financial adviser Charles Lewis because she blamed him for
financial losses in the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash.
   Prosecutors said she called him 485 times one day.
   Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Renee White, who accepted Mrs.
Scull's plea, also assessed her $60 in court costs and ordered her
not to call, write or go near Lewis for three years.
   Mrs. Scull, formerly married to taxi mogul Robert Scull, was
awarded art works worth millions in her divorce settlement in 1974.
The artists whose works she collected include Jasper Johns and Andy
Warhol.

   A court has upheld a ruling that helped
former heavyweight boxing champ Muhammad Ali keep his house off the
auction block.
   Commonwealth Court said the tax sale notice sent to Ali was
flawed because it was not established that the person who signed
for the notice was authorized by Ali to do so. The decision
affirmed a 1987 ruling by Montgomery County Common Pleas Court.
   ``I'm extremely happy,'' said Ali's attorney, Oscar Gaskins.
   He said the house was sold at a tax sale on Sept. 9, 1985, for
$20,000. Ali had purchased the house for $70,000 and it was
probably worth $120,000, Gaskins said. The tax bill was for between
$4,000 and $6,000, Gaskins said.
   Gaskins said the taxes have since been paid and Ali, who lives
in California, has given the house to his teen-age daughter, Khalia.

<HEAD>Former Vice President Requests Tax Refund for Bribe Restitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Vice President Spiro Agnew says he
should be able to deduct $142,500 in restitution he paid Maryland
for bribes he was accused of collecting while governor, a newspaper
reported today.
   The Los Angeles Times also reported that Agnew has asked a
California tax board to refund $24,197 in state income taxes.
   Agnew claimed the deduction on his 1982 California income tax
return after a Maryland judge ordered him to reimburse that state
for the kickbacks prosecutors said he had accepted during his
tenure as governor plus $101,235 in interest.
   The deduction was rejected four years later by a California
Franchise Tax Board auditor, who assessed Agnew additional taxes
and interest.
   The Times said Agnew appealed the auditor's decision to the
California State Board of Equalization, which has scheduled a
hearing Thursday.
   Agnew, who lives in Rancho Mirage, argued in his tax appeal that
he is entitled to a deduction on his California income tax because
he paid the $142,500.
   The kickback scandal came to light as the Watergate scandal was
bringing down the Nixon administration. Agnew resigned as President
Nixon's vice president Oct. 10, 1973, as part of a plea agreement
with federal prosecutors.
   He pleaded no contest to charges of income tax evasion on
thousands of dollars prosecutors said he had taken as Baltimore
County executive from 1962 to 1966 and as Maryland governor from
1967 to 1969. The kickbacks were in exchange for government
contracts, prosecutors said.
   Agnew was ordered to pay $148,000 to the federal government and
$14,105 to Maryland. Agnew is seeking the tax deduction in
California because by the time the final ruling was issued in the
Maryland case in 1981, he became a California resident and had
already made payment.
   Agnew also contended he was being taxed twice _ by Maryland when
he was directed to pay $14,105 in back taxes, and by California. He
also complained it is unfair to pay taxes on money he was not
allowed to keep.
   ``There is no doubt it is patently unfair,'' Agnew's lawyer T.
Rogers Harrison, of Maryland, wrote in the tax appeal.
   But lawyers for the California Franchise Tax Board said the
question of double taxation is something Agnew must resolve with
Maryland, not California. They said in Agnew's case, the tax was
paid before he became a California resident.
   ``The state of California has never received any income in the
form of taxes or otherwise, from the amounts (Agnew) allegedly
received as bribes during his various terms of office,'' Lazaro L.
Bobiles, a lawyer for the franchise board, wrote in replay to the
appeal.
   ``(Agnew) has made restitution of the alleged bribes only to the
state of Maryland and has paid taxes on the alleged bribes only to
that state and to the federal government.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices finished at a new high on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 131.05 yen, down 1.21 yen from the previous
day's 132.26-yen close. It opened at 131.63 yen and ranged between
130.88 yen and 131.88 yen. The dollar now has fallen 2.20 yen in
the last four trading days.
   Traders said today's lower opening followed the dollar's
overnight losses on overseas markets amid dollar-selling by
European central banks in New York and London.
   ``Japanese investors already were reluctant to buy the dollar
after the Bank of Japan's dollar-selling, yen-buying intervention
yesterday (Monday),'' said an analyst with a commercial bank,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``That's why a rumor that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board made an
inquiry to one of the American banks in Japan spread in the market
during morning trading and further discouraged participants' dollar
buying,'' the analyst added.
   He said the Bank of Japan's intervention Monday had a strong
impact after the market's recent dollar-buying trend. The dollar
had climbed to a closing of 133.25 on Wednesday. The Japanese
central bank's dollar-selling intervention was its first since 1985.
   The communique released by the Group of Seven leading
industrialized nations in Washington Monday, in which finance
officials reaffirmed the desirability of stable currency rates,
also contributed to pushing the dollar lower, the analyst said.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which
gained 203.39 points Monday, added another 270.18 points, or 0.82
percent, closing at 33,312.25, yet another high.
   The market's key index has climbed for the last six trading
days, gaining almost 1,800 points.
   Dealers said stability in oil prices and the yen's upward trend
in the foreign exchange market relieved investors and encouraged
buying.
   Both individual and institutional investors were trading
actively, said a dealer with New Japan Securities Co. Ltd. in
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Trading was active, with first section volume estimated at 1.7
billion shares, compared with 1.4 billion Monday. Among the gainers
were construction and steel issues.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors today demanded the death
penalty for a woman who said she was working for North Korea when
she blew up a South Korean airliner in 1987, killing all 115 people
on board.
   Calling the bombing ``an unpardonable crime to mankind,''
Prosecutor Lee Sang-hyung blamed ``the dictatorship in North Korea
for the grave crime of killing the passengers.''
   The prosecution said North Korea ordered the bombing in an
attempt to disrupt the Seoul Olympics, which were held without
incident in September.
   The defendant, Kim Hyon Yui, 27, bowed her head and sobbed and
told the court ``it is fortunate the truth has been disclosed.
   ``I now curse (North Korean President) Kim Il Sung and Kim Jung
Il (his son and heir),'' she said, wiping her eyes with a
hankerchief. ``I do not know how to atone for my crime.''
   Kim's defense attorney, Ahn Dong-il, said his client should not
be punished even though she admitted to planting the bomb because
she was ``forced to commit the act and it is someone else who needs
to be punished _ North Korea.''
   Sentencing was set for April 25.
   Court officials indicated privately that Kim may be pardoned
because they say she was duped by North Korea and has repented.
   ``Why do you keep her alive?'' screamed relatives of victims
allowed into the courtroom. ``Kill her,'' they wailed.
   Security was tight and hundreds of police and security agents
ringed the Seoul District Court during today's proceedings. In
South Korea, defendants must stand trial even if they confess.
   The defendant said on South Korean television in January 1988
that she planted a bomb on the South Korean airliner in November
1987 as part of a North Korean plot to disrupt the Olympic Games in
Seoul last summer.
   North Korea has denied involvement.
   Police Lt. Kim Moon-Ho, an explosives expert, testified today
that the mixture of explosives used in the bomb was so powerful
that it would have destroyed the aircraft in less than a second.
   ``There would be no time, no chance, to contact anybody,'' he
told the court.
   The Korean Air Boeing 707 disappeared on a flight from Baghdad
to Seoul over the Andaman Sea as it approached the Burmese coast.
   Kim said she and another intelligence agent pretending to be
Japanese tourists planted the bomb when they flew from Baghdad to
Abu Dhabi, where they got off.
   The pair were arrested a short time later in Bahrain and
attempted to take cyanide hidden in cigarettes. The other agent, an
elderly man, died, but Kim recovered and was extradited to Seoul.
   Details of the bomb, how it was planted and detonated have come
from Kim since little plane wreckage was ever found.

   Two gunmen burst into the home of a Roman Catholic
man in the town of Ballymoney today and killed him in his bed,
police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell
on Protestant guerrillas.
   Belfast police headquarters said in a statement that the attack
occurred shortly after midnight in the town about 40 miles
northwest of Belfast. Police said the unidentified 29-year-old
victim was the father of four.
   They said his 3-month-old daughter was asleep in a crib beside
his bed when he was shot. The child was unhurt, they said.
   A stolen car believed to have been used by the gunmen for their
getaway was later found burned out in another part of Ballymoney.
   The killing appeared to be the latest in a series of what are
thought to be retaliatory murders by Protestant and Roman Catholic
extremists that began Feb. 12 with the slaying of a prominent
Catholic attorney.
   Meanwhile, a news report on Monday said the British Broadcasting
Corp. transferred two of its Belfast-based journalists out of
Northern Ireland after the Irish Republican Army threatened to kill
them.
   The BBC refused to discuss the report by Press Association, the
domestic British news agency, other than to confirm ``two BBC
personnel have received death threats from the IRA.''
   Press Association did not name the journalists, but said one was
the editor of news and current affairs for Northern Ireland and the
other was a female reporter.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the mainly Roman
Catholic Republic of Ireland. Protestant guerrillas are fighting
the effort.

<TEXT>
   Three California gray
whales cavorting in the sparkling aquamarine waters of Two Arm Bay
are the vanguard of migrating mammals that have arrived here every
spring for thousands of years.
   Danger lurks just 30 miles to the north.
   Just beyond the town of Seward and Cape Resurrection, a sluggish
river tinted iridescent by the sun flows across the surface of the
sea. It appears to be drifting inexorably toward Two Arm Bay.
   It took just 12 days for tendrils of the 10.1 million gallon
crude oil spill in Prince William Sound to thread their way around
reefs and rocks, through straits and narrows, to threaten the
669,501-acre national park. Just 12 days for man's folly to collide
with nature's symmetry.
   ``I keep hoping the whales are so intelligent they'll sense the
danger and just go away,'' said Anne Castellina, the national
park's superintendent.
   ``They've come back again right on time, and I don't know how
we'll protect them.''
   The oil, released when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran onto a reef
on Good Friday, has been carried by winds and currents to within
five miles of the park and the rich fishing grounds around Seward.
   ``Right now the spill is missing us, but we're planning for a
worst-case scenario,'' said Ms. Castellina. ``From what I saw in
Valdez, that's the only way to go.''
   Hundreds of miles of shoreline around the port town of Valdez,
terminus of the trans-Alaska pipeline, have been fouled by the
spill, and thousands of animals and birds already have died because
of the pollution.
   ``If we get hit there's not much to do to protect the park's 610
miles of shoreline, but we can boom off the salmon streams.''
   Created in 1980, the new national park is a priceless necklace
of bird rookeries, tidal pools, and watery whale playgrounds draped
along the Kenai Peninsula's eastern coastline. Because most of the
park can be reached only by floatplane or boat, it attracted fewer
than 60,000 tourists last year, and is more hospitable to its
critters than its visitors.
   The park chief, working with a federal-state disaster team and
officials from Seward, had to decide what should be saved first.
With only several thousand feet of boom available to block the oil
from contaminating rivers, streams, beaches and harbors, there were
tough choices to make.
   ``It's that time of year when all the little critters come back
to where they spend the summer,'' said Ms. Castellina. ``If the oil
comes, the seals and birds aren't going to know what they're
getting into and soon we'll have dead animals.
   ``Then the bears who are waking up right now from hibernation
are going to go down to the beaches and see all this great dead
stuff and then this glop is going to get into their stomachs, and
then will come the eagles, and this mess will be in the whole chain
and could go on for years.''
   Ms. Castellina said the group had decided the rich
salmon-spawning Resurrection River would be saved first.
   But in places like Beauty Bay and Surprise Bay, Quicksand Cove
and Granite Passage, the seals and otters and sea lions will be on
their own because there's not enough help to go around.
   Sunday, the National Park Service received permission to deploy
a boom itself instead of having to rely on the Coast Guard.
   Three boats carrying biologists are searching the park coastline
to inventory flora and fauna.
   ``We want to be able to document what the impacts are because in
the end Exxon may get a bill,'' said Bud Rice, the park's resource
management specialist.
   ``We're scrambling ... to collect pre-oil carcasses and pin down
the cause of death so we can avoid the charge later of `Well, how
do you know those dead critters weren't there already?'''
   The grim tasks stand in stark contrast to promotional material
the park offers.
   ``Humans have had little lasting impact on this environment,'' a
colorful brochure says. ``The park's overwhelming significance is
as a living laboratory of change.''

<HEAD>Marcos' Wife Plans to Embalm Him When He Dies, Paper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos plans to embalm her
husband him when he dies and display his body in Hawaii until she
can scatter his ashes over the Philippines to ``fertilize his
country,'' a newspaper reported today.
   ``Not only will it be a political statement: It will be a
spectacle _ an international spectacle to have Marcos (lie is
state) here,'' she told BusinessWorld in an interview at the Marcos
home in Honolulu over the weekend.
   President Ferdinand Marcos fled to Hawaii when he was ousted by
a military-civilian uprising in February 1986 that swept Corazon
Aquino to power.
   Marcos, 71, has been hospitalized in Honolulu since Jan. 15 for
treatment of heart and lung ailments. Hospital officials say he
remains in guarded condition.
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly rejected appeals by Marcos' relatives
to allow the former president to return. In February, Cabinet
Secretary Jose de Jesus said that for security reasons the
president and the Cabinet had agreed not to allow even Marcos' body
to be brought home if he dies.
   ``I'll keep Marcos here until 1992. Then I'll bring him home,''
Mrs. Marcos was reported as saying in the interview. That is the
year when President Aquino's six-year term ends and a new
presidential election is held.
   Marcos mother's body was embalmed and put on display after she
died last May at age 95. Relatives say they are waiting for the
former president to return to bury her.
   The body of Josefa Edralin-Marcos now lies in state at Marcos'
provincial home in Batac, 240 miles north of Manila. A mortician
visits every two months to inject embalming fluid and retouch her
made-up face.
   In the interview, Mrs. Marcos also said she was optimistic that
Mrs. Aquino's successor would allow them to return and fulfill a
wish of her husband to be cremated and have his ashes scattered
``to fertilize his country.''
   Mrs. Marcos, who is more than 20 years younger than her husband
and was once groomed to succeed him, said she had no intention of
running in 1992.
   ``I've seen it all. I've had it all. Now, all I want is to be
left alone,'' she said.
   The Marcoses have been indicted on racketeering charges by a New
York grand jury. Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent at her arraignment
last October, but her husband's arraignment has been postponed
because of his health.
   They are accused of stealing more than $100 million from the
Philippine government and using the money to buy prime New York
property. The Aquino government says the Marcoses and their
associates robbed the country of at least $10 billion in cash and
other assets during the 20-year rule by Marcos.

   A white police officer has been charged with
misdemeanor assault for allegedly slamming a black man's head
through a store window in an arrest that was broadcast on national
television.
   Long Beach Police Officer Mark Dickey also was charged Monday
with filing a false police report in the Jan. 14 arrest of Don C.
Jackson, a self-styled activist against police brutality.
   Jackson, trying to prove his theory that Long Beach police
routinely mistreat minorities, drove into Long Beach on a Saturday
night with an NBC-TV crew following at a discreet distance.
   When Jackson was pulled over by police, the crew filmed the
ensuing violence, which was broadcast on the ``Today'' show. The
tape showed an officer shoving Jackson's head through a plate glass
window.
   ``What we have here is a situation where a citizen went out and
tried to provoke an incident,'' said District Attorney Ira Reiner.
``But after the officer had control of the suspect and control of
the situation, he lost control of himself.''
   Reiner told reporters that Dickey then compounded his misconduct
by filing a false report on the incident.
   Dickey, 28, was charged with assault. He and his partner, Mark
Ramsey, 26, were also charged with filing a false police report.
   The charges against Dickey carry a maximum sentence of one year
in prison upon conviction. The charge against Ramsey carries a
possible maximum of six months.
   Jackson, 30, a Hawthorne police sergeant on disability leave,
was originally was charged with resisting arrest. Those charges
were dropped March 22 by the Long Beach city attorney who also
dismissed a ticket given to Jeffrey Hill, driver of the car in
which Jackson was riding.

   Ashley Nicole Richardson began life near the fast
lane, choosing to be born on the shoulder of Interstate 5.
   Her father, Bren Richardson, was trying to weave through Monday
morning rush-hour traffic hoping to get his wife, Pamela, to
Northwest Hospital on time.
   But when Ashley began to arrive in the family sedan, Richardson
pulled to the shoulder and jumped out.
   ``Two cars stopped instead of running over me and each one had a
nurse in it,'' he said.
   Richardson said he delivered his daughter with the nurses
telling him what to do. ``Then they took over and wrapped the baby
up,'' he said.
   ``Then I got in the back seat and just shook and shook. I wasn't
ready for this. Pamela's going to be the death of me.''
   Mother and daughter were taken to the hospital, tired but in
fine health, Northwest officials said.
   The baby had been expected Thursday.
   The Richardsons have another daughter, 19-month-old Kelsey.

   Former Klansman David Duke received
contributions from around the country in his successful race for a
state House seat, campaign finance records show.
   Duke's report filed Monday showed he collected $137,000 and
spent $116,000. Fellow Republican John Treen's report showed he
collected $198,900 and spent $189,000.
   Most races for the 105-member House cost candidates less than
$30,000.
   Duke, 38, defeated Treen by 227 votes in the Feb. 18 special
election to represent a nearly all-white district in Metairie, a
New Orleans suburb.
   The Republican National Committee donated $16,500 to Treen and
shunned Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founder
of the National Association for the Advancement of White People.
   President Bush and former president Reagan had endorsed Treen,
and national GOP chairman Lee Atwater denounced Duke's victory.
   Nearly 2,700 people from California to New York sent money to
Duke, ranging from $1 to $500.
   Treen received money from fewer than 800 contributors.
   Treen, 63, called the totals in his report misleading, saying he
actually wound up with a deficit rather than a surplus because
$21,200 of his collections was money he loaned the campaign.
Collections include contributions, loans and in-kind services
according to state law.
   Treen said his campaign repaid some of the loan but still has
debts, ``including $13,000 to me,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   Meanwhile, state GOP chairman Billy Nungesser announced a
campaign to lure more Democrats to his party but said he has ``no
plans to talk with Mr. Duke abbout this party.''
   ``Democrats elected David Duke to office. The Republicans in
that district supported Treen,'' Nungesser told the Press Club of
Baton Rouge.
   Only about 400,000 of the state's nearly 2 million registered
voters are registered Republicans.

<TEXT>
   Police and guerrillas battled again in
northern Namibia today and officials said 180 people had been
killed in four days of fighting since the territory began its
transition to independence.
   South African military officials say the fighting is the worst
in 23 years of bush war against the Sout-West Africa People's
Organization.
   Police Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand said 161 guerrillas and 19
police had been killed since Saturday in a remote region near the
Angolan border. He said 41 policemen and an undetermined number of
guerrillas were wounded.
   Du Rand said police, aided by Namibian soldiers, were conducting
``follow-up operations right through Ovamboland,'' the border strip
where the SWAPO guerrillas have major support.
   The independent South African Press Association said heavy
fighting occurred Monday at Oshikango, a few miles from the border.
   South African officials said the fighting was started by
guerrillas who crossed the border Saturday from Angola, violating a
U.N. accord that is to free Namibia from South African rule.
   Under the agreement, all guerrillas are to remain in Angola at
least 100 miles north of Namibia's border until mid-May.
   Guerrilla officials and the Angolan government claim the
fighters have been in Namibia for some time and fired in
self-defense after security forces attacked them.
   Villagers in northern towns, most of whom support the rebels,
said they believe the guerrillas left Angola to return home and did
not expect a fight because the independence process officially has
begun.
   The villagers said the guerrillas have no newspapers or radios
at their Angolan bush camps, have little contact with senior
guerrilla commanders and probably have little understanding of the
peace process.
   South Africa, however, accused the guerrillas of trying to
organize armed bases inside Namibia.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said: ``I have very
little doubt that the plan was that they should infiltrate to
establish bases quickly, then they would have liked to claim that
they have always been there.''
   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said in a
radio editorial issued in Johannesburg today that the guerrilla
incursions ``bear all the signs of a planned and well-organized
operation.''
   U.N. officials on Monday permitted 1,500 South African and
Namibian troops to leave their bases to help policeman fighting the
1,200 guerrillas, South African Col. Japie Dreyer and other
officers said.
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said
the fighting does not mean the peace plan is failing.
   A United Nations investigation found that guerrillas had mounted
a ``major incursion'' from Angola into Namibia during the weekend,
said three Western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United States urged Pretoria to exercise restraint.
Washington also said it was holding urgent consultations with the
Soviet Union, Cuba and Angola to prevent the unraveling of the
peace accord.
   ``All information available to us indicates that a major
infiltration of northern Namibia by military forces of the
South-West Africa People's Organization is occurring,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler in Washington.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the guerrilla organization ``appears to be
taking advantage'' of the vacuum created because U.N. peacekeepers
still are deploying to monitor the peace agreement.
   Only about 1,000 of the planned 4,650 U.N. troops have been
deployed. ``We have 300 men in the northern part of the area. You
cannot say it is a failure,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   SWAPO, South Africa and Angola said Monday they remain committed
to the U.N. plan, which calls for Nov. 1 elections leading to
independence early next year.

<HEAD>Pinochet's Finance Czar Resigns To Mull Presidency Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hernan Buchi, the architect of Chile's
successful free-market economy, says he has resigned as finance
minister to consider running for president.
   In response to Buchi's departure, President Augusto Pinochet
asked his 15 other Cabinet members Monday to resign so he could
reorganize the body.
   Government spokesman Miguel Angel Poduje said Buchi's
replacement and any other Cabinet changes would be announced on
Wednesday. No important changes were foreseen in economic policy.
   Buchi, 40, said he resigned to study the persistent appeals of a
group of conservative politicians and business leaders who want him
to run for president in the Dec. 14 elections.
   The group has plastered bumper stickers and posters supporting
Buchi's candidacy throughout the capital and said last week it has
collected 142,000 signatures from citizens backing the campaign.
   ``It never was, and is not, my intention to be presented for
this type of candidacy,'' Buchi told reporters at the Finance
Ministry. ``Nonetheless, the situation has reached the (point) that
my name is being publicly mentioned.
   ``I reached the conclusion that analyzing this situation was
incompatible with keeping my post as finance minister,'' he said.
   The December elections are the first since before Pinochet
seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, toppling an elected leftist
government. The 73-year-old army commander was obliged to call
elections after losing a referendum in October on a proposal to
extend his rule to 1997.
   Although his supporters want him to run, Pinochet insists he
will not be a candidate. The constitution bars him from running.
   Buchi, who holds a master's degree in business adminstration
from New York's Columbia University, joined the Pinochet
government's economic team at age 29 and rose swiftly to become its
chief.
   After serving as an advisor and as health undersecretary, he was
named planning minister in 1983, banks superintendent a year later
and finance minister in February 1985.
   Pushing exports and promoting foreign investment, the
government's economic program has produced five consecutive years
of growth while keeping inflation to a current annual rate of about
13 percent, far lower than most Latin American countries.
   It has elicited praise from financial experts, although
Pinochet's critics contend the policies carried a high social cost
and reduced the buying power of most workers' wages.
   Pinochet frequently boasts of his government's economic
successes and often praises Buchi in public. He has affectionately
called him ``our Prince Valiant,'' a reference to Buchi's ragged
pageboy haircut.
   A recent opinion poll showed Buchi as the strongest of several
potential conservative or rightist presidential candidates, but
lagging behind opposition leader Patricio Aylwin.
   Aylwin, 70, is candidate of the centrist Christian Democratic
Party and is seeking the backing of a coalition of 17 centrist and
leftist parties.

   A U.N. investigation of the fierce combat
in Namibia found that nationalist guerrillas mounted a ``major
incursion'' from Angola the day the territory began its transition
to independence, diplomats say.
   South Africa claimed the South-West Africa People's Organization
fighters had violated the U.N. plan under which it is ending its
74-year rule of Namibia.
   SWAPO leaders denied guerrillas involved in the fighting near
the Angolan border had crossed into Namibia and criticized U.N.
adminstrators for agreeing to let South African troops reinforce
police battling the guerrillas.
   ``Our people are being butchered under the United Nations
flag,'' said SWAPO Foreign Secretary Theo-Ben Gurirab, accusing
South African forces of initiating the fighting.
   Namibian police say at least 161 rebels and 19 police have died
in the fighting that began Saturday, when a formal cease-fire was
to have begun. They said the fighting continued today.
   Under the U.N.-brokered independence accord, all guerrillas are
to remain in Angola at least 100 miles north of Namibia's border
until mid-May.
   But diplomats said the SWAPO guerrillas apparently felt they
were entitled under the accord to set up bases inside Namibia under
U.N. supervision just as the South Africans, whom they have been
fighting for 23 years.
   Whether SWAPO should be allowed in Namibia has been a
contentious question in the independence process.
   The report on the situation by investigators led by the U.N.
special representative for Angola, Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, was
relayed to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who briefed
Security Council members on Monday, said three Western diplomats
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The diplomats said the report, presented in an atmosphere of
unusual secrecy, concluded that up to 1,000 guerrillas infiltrated
northern Namibia but that their motive was unclear. Its details
were not disclosed.
   Black African diplomats were outraged.
   ``There can never be any question of infiltration, these are
Namibians,'' said Zambian Ambassador Peter Zuze.
   South Africa has accused the rebels of infiltrating in an
attempt to set up bases, an option that was rejected during 10
years of U.N. negotiations on terms of the Namibian independence
plan.
   Some U.N. diplomats said they believed many rebels misunderstood
the terms of the cease-fire and peace plan and thought they could
safely march home to Namibia bearing their weapons.
   Others accepted South Africa's claim that the rebel leadership
sent the guerrillas in to establish base camps in a bid to have
them put under U.N. supervision just as South African troops are to
be confined to barracks.
   Diplomats said Ahtisaari's report did not attempt to assign
motives for the border crossing.
   Gurirab insisted the guerrillas always had been in Namibia and
criticized U.N. administrators in Namibia for allowing South
African troops to reinforce the territorial police.
   ``The president of SWAPO (Sam Nujoma), on March 29, issued a
directive to SWAPO combatants in Namibia to make contact with (U.N.
peacekeepers) for purposes of being confined to base,'' he said.
   Since armed rebels troops are obviously in Namibia, said
Gurirab, ``It would make sense, and it would serve everybody's
interest if they would be confined to base and monitored by (U.N.
observers).''
   Gurirab criticized U.N. officials who allowed the deployment of
1,500 South African troops to back up Namibian police, but did not
name names.
   ``It's a very ugly, ugly sin. I think you all know that there
has been a longstanding bloody conflict between South African
forces and our forces, and for the U.N. to pretend that South
Africa is an impartial, disinterested party in this conflict is, to
say the lest, most preposterous,'' said Gurirab.
   Perez de Cuellar said the fighting did not mean the peace plan
is failing, adding that most of the 4,650 U.N. troops planned for
the mission are not yet on the scene. Only about 1,000 U.N. troops
have been deployed.
   ``We have 300 men in the northern part of the area. You cannot
say it is a failure,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   SWAPO, South Africa and Angola said Monday that they remain
committed to the U.N. plan, which calls for Nov. 1 elections
leading to independence early next year.
   Besides independence for Namibia, the plan calls for the
withdrawal of Cuban troops who have been helping the Marxist
government in Angola fight South Africa-backed rebels.

   Contra rebels have agreed to
observe a cease-fire until February, when elections are scheduled
in Nicaragua, but pledge to keep their forces combat-ready to
pressure the Sandinista government.
   A source in the rebel directorate, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Commander Enrique Bermudez told the rebels about
the decision during visits Friday to Contra camps just across the
border from Nicaragua.
   Bermudez is the Contras chief military leader.
   Radio Liberacion, the Contras' radio station, also broadcast a
message Monday from Bermudez that said: ``The rebels will not
launch any attack against the Sandinistas until February 1990. We
will not look for combat but will permanently be on the defensive.
   ``The rebel army will be preserved intact, on the defense and
watching for the Sandinistas to fulfill their promise of greater
democracy for Nicaragua.''
   The leftist Sandinista government has declared monthly
unilateral cease-fires since the expiration of a temporary truce
the two sides signed in March 1988. The truce was to lay the
groundwork for a permanent peace but talks collapsed last September.
   There was no immediate Sandinista reaction to the rebel
announcement.
   In February, five Central American presidents agreed to come up
with a plan by mid-May to disband the Contras. Nicaragua, in turn,
agreed to general elections in February and to other steps toward
democratic reforms.
   That accord took U.S. officials by surprise. They reacted with a
bipartisan proposal now before Congress to provide about $45
million in non-lethal aid to the rebels through February.
   Fighting in the 7-year-old war has diminished to sporadic
skirmishes since U.S. military aid to the Contras ended in February
1988. An estimated 11,000 rebels and members of their families live
in the Honduran camps.
   The message broadcast by Radio Liberacion quoted Bermudez as
saying: ``The weapons of the freedom fighters constitute the only
guarantee that the Nicaraguan people have to pressure the
Sandinistas into fulfilling their promise of introducing democracy
to Nicaragua.
   ``For that reason, our troops will remain intact and alert but
will not participate in actions of destruction or attacks against
Sandinista military positions.
   ``We reaffirm our desire to achieve democracy and freedom for
our country through peaceful means, but we reaffirm also our
decision to achieve these desires through weapons if the peaceful
means fail.''
   Bermudez reportedly left for Miami on Friday.
   The rebel source also said Juan Ramon Vivas Romero, known as
Commander Quiche, had temporarily stepped down as head of the
Contras' chiefs of staff because of pain from an old combat wound.
The source said Israel Galeano, known as Commander Franklin,
replaced Vivas Romero.

   With no telephone nearby and the fire
department three miles away, a man watched helplessly as flames
engulfed his mobile home and took the lives of six children, five
of them his grandchildren.
   ``I woke up when the fire bug (alarm) went off and tried to get
all the children out,'' English, 57, said Monday.
   Five other grandchildren who had been sleeping managed to escape
with English after the fire broke out early Sunday. One of them
suffered a burned hand, family members said.
   ``I heard the fire alarm and my cousins let the window up and
pushed the screen out and all four of us got out the window,'' said
Jacobia English, 11, who lost two brothers.
   Next-door neighbor Charlie Wright Jr. said he ``heard the
hollering'' from the double-wide trailer and ``knew the kids were
burning up.''
   Wright drove three miles to Rembert, a small town of about 500,
and set off a siren, but the fire had nearly consumed the home by
the time he returned with firefighters.
   Family members had gathered in this Sumter County town to
celebrate the birthday of English's daughter, Peggy Miller of
Beaufort. Her three children _ 8-month-old Nericaletha, 1-year-old
Kesim and 3-year-old Clyde _ died in the blaze.
   County Coroner Bill Gamble identified the other victims as the
Miller children's cousins, Travis and James English of Rembert,
ages 9 and 11, and a friend, Terrance Campbell, 5, of Camden.
Officials said the children died of smoke inhalation.
   Emma English, Jacobia's mother, had been with other family
members in a mobile home 150 yards down a dirt road from the
trailer when the fire broke out. The family gathered at the home
again Monday to mourn.
   ``I just can't get over it. It seems like a dream,'' said Mrs.
English said.
   ``This is the worst fire we can recall in Sumter County,'' Fire
Chief Larry Causey said. ``It's saddening to think something like
this can happen.''
   Investigators haven't determined the cause of the blaze.

   The dollar fell sharply in early European trading
today but stabilized by late morning. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign currency dealers said they thought the dollar had
touched bottom for now and would probably fluctuate within narrow
margins before testing news lows again later this week.
   One trader in Rome said that Monday's central bank intervention,
especially by the Bank of Japan, yen-buying by Japanese industries
at the beginning of their fiscal year, and market rumors that West
Germany may raise interest rates combined to push the dollar lower
overnight.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 1.21 yen to a closing 131.05. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 131.03 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8700 West German marks, down from 1.8835
   _1.6370 Swiss francs, down from 1.6488
   _6.3075 French francs, down from 6.3535
   _2.1078 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1230
   _1,371.50 Italian lire, down from 1,381.50
   _1.1883 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1896
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7030, more expensive for
buyers than late Monday's $1.6855.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $387 dollars a troy
ounce, up from $384.75 dollars bid late Monday. At midmorning
today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended
price of $386.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $386.75, up from $385.25 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.14 to close at a bid price
of $388.42.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.83 a troy
ounce, up from Monday's $5.80.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An immigration judge has ordered the deportation
of a reputed organized crime boss linked to a dozen killings and
known as the ``Al Capone of Italy.''
   Carmine Esposito received the order Monday, but it could take
moths before his is deported to his native Italy, said Craig
Oswald, assistant counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
   Oswald said Judge Craig M. Zerbe weighed the positive factors in
Esposito's case _ his wife and one of his children are U.S.
citizens _ against negative factors that included Esposito's
alleged membership in an Italian criminal clan similar to the Mafia
and his entry into the United States on a false passport.
   The negative factors ``weigh overwhelmingly against an exercise
of judgment on (Esposito's) behalf,'' the judge decided.
   Philip Parenti, Esposito's attorney, said he planned to
challenge the ruling before the Board of Immigration Appeals.
   ``We're appealing the fact that they can't use foreign
convictions to deport somebody,'' Parenti said.
   ``Basically they're trying to accomplish through the back door
what they couldn't do through extradition.''
   Authorities originally tried to deport Esposito on an Italian
extradition memo, but the Italian charges were dropped after
Esposito was not brought to trial within 18 months of his arrest as
required by law in Italy.
   Italian authorities charged that Esposito ordered or committed
12 killings in Italy from April 1982 through June 1983 while
holding a top post in the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, a criminal
clan that operates in and around Naples, near Esposito's home town
of Acerra.
   When those charges were dropped, U.S. authorities shifted the
case to immigration courts, moving to deport Esposito on grounds
that he entered the United States illegally.
   Esposito, 31, was arrested in March 1988 at his North Side
restaurant. He also had worked as an auto-body repairman, car
salesman and sausage-maker.

<HEAD>University of Michigan Faculty Scrap Plan for Mandatory Racism Classes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Michigan faculty has
rejected a proposal to make racism courses mandatory following
several racist incidents on campus in recent years.
   Faculty instead agreed Monday to ask the curriculum committee of
the College of Literature, Science and the Arts to consider by next
fall ways to offer racism studies.
   Incidents at the university have included the distribution of a
flyer declaring ``open season'' on blacks in 1987, racist jokes by
a disc jockey on the student radio station and the stuffing of Ku
Klux Klan literature under black students' doors.
   Faculty defeated by 140-120 a proposal that would have required
students to take four credit hours of classes dealing with racism.
Classes could have been in economics, sociology or other fields.
   Philosophy Prof. Peter Railton, who drew up the proposal, said
he was optimistic despite the vote.
   ``The debate was a substantive and good one. I think the
discussion and the vote will have impact on thinking of the
(curriculum) committee,'' Railton said.
   About 5,000 of the university's 32,400 students are minorities,
some of whom say the campus has been plagued with racist and
anti-Semitic graffiti and occasional tauntings.

<HEAD>Six Die In Latest Fighting, Power Plant Running Out Of Fuel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian gunners attacked
residential areas in and around Beirut with howitzers and rockets,
and police said at least six people were killed and 18 wounded
during a night of fighting.
   The bombardment that began late Saturday subsided into sporadic
exchanges at daybreak today.
   The overnight casualties raised the toll to 153 people killed
and 499 wounded since March 8, when the latest round of hostilities
broke out between Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian troops and an
alliance of Syrian and Druse forces.
   Meanwhile, Lebanon's electricity authority said in a statement
that its power station in the Christian suburb of Zouk would run
out of fuel oil today and it would stop providing power to most of
Lebanon.
   The statement said a freighter loaded with 30 tons of fuel oil
has not been able to unload its cargo at the power station's dock
because of the shelling.
   Insurance companies ``want a solid cease-fire before accepting
to cover any ship that wants to dock at the Zouk station,'' the
statement said.
   The independent daily An-Nahar and other publications today
carried front-page statements from the U.S. State Department and
the European Community calling for a cease-fire in Lebanon.
   Despite the relative lull today, civilians remained huddled in
basements and bomb shelters.
   A dozen families in the basement of an apartment building in the
Christian district of Adonis dispatched one man to a bakery for
bread.
   ``This is the safest way, we will send one of us to buy food for
the whole building every day until a cease-fire is declared and
accepted by both sides,'' Antoine Shedyak said.
   ``Yes, there is a lull, but there is no cease-fire. We will not
take any unnecessary risks,'' Shedyak, a mechanical engineer, said
in a telephone interview.
   Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Ahmad Sabah was due in the
Syrian capital of Damascus today to try end the present
confrontation.
   Sabah heads a six-man Arab League committee assigned to find a
settlement to a political crisis that threatens to cement Lebanon's
partition into sectarian mini-states.
   The leftist daily paper As-Safir, which is close to Syria, said
Sabah would propose a two-month truce in the conflict to give the
Arab League committee enough time to solve the crisis.
   Aoun, backed by 20,000 troops, has insisted that Syria be party
to any cease-fire accord. The current fighting broke out when Aoun
blockaded illegal militia ports that diverted $100 million from
government-run ports.
   The Syrians have 40,000 troops in predominantly Moslem areas of
Lebanon under a peacekeeping mandate their received from the Arab
League in 1976, two years after civil war broke out in Lebanon.
   Officially, the Syrians maintain that their troops in Lebanon
are not involved in the confrontation with Aoun's forces, which are
entrenched across a 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of
Beirut.
   Nabih Berri, the Shiite Moslem chief of the Amal militia, said
Monday in Damascus that 20 representatives of Moslem and leftist
groups would meet Sabah in Damascus on Wednesday.
   Press reports said the group would outline its desire for a new
political system that distributes powers equally among the various
Lebanese sects, the election of a new president and formal links
with Syria.
   The Christians are to dispatch a 10-man delegation for a meeting
with Sabah later in the week.
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since Sept. 22, when
the six-year-term of President Amin Gemayel expired with parliament
failing to elect a successor.
   Gemayel appointed Aoun, a fellow Maronite, head of an interim
military cabinet to rule pending the election of a new president.
   Syrian-backed Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment because it
violated a 45-year-old tradition of having a Sunni Moslem prime
minister.

   Joe Carden, The Associated Press operator who
filed the flashes telling the world of President Kennedy's
assassination and that man had set foot on the moon, has died. He
was 80.
   Funeral services for Carden were held Monday. He died Friday at
Baylor University Medical Center, where he was being treated for
cancer.
   For 45 years, Carden worked as an automatic operator for the AP,
punching stories onto tape that fed transmitters. He retired in
1974.
   The Kennedy assassination flash carried his initials ``JJC,'' as
did stories sent during the Apollo moon landings.
   ``He never got ruffled. He was always pleasant, always kind and
patient,'' said Cheryl Wolfe, an AP communications secretary who
worked with Carden.
   A ``flash'' is the rarely used code given the news service's
stories of highest priority.
   Carden is survived by his wife, Norrine Carden of Dallas, and
three daughters.

   Wedding bells are OK, but those who get
married in the Oklahoma County Courthouse can no longer celebrate
with rice or birdseed.
   Oklahoma County Commissioners on Monday voted to ban the
throwing of rice, bird seed, confetti and other similar substances
in and around the courthouse.
   Rice and bird seed traditionally have been tossed at weddings as
symbols of fertility, but the commissioners' action apparently was
not an effort to limit population growth.
   Commissioner F.G. ``Buck'' Buchanan said the policy was enacted
as a safety measure.
   ``We've had people who have been hurt by sliding on rice and so

   A South Korean dissident today called his
unauthorized visit to North Korea a success and said he was ready
to face arrest at home.
   ``I'm not nervous about my arrest but I hope I won't be
arrested,'' Rev. Moon Ik-hwan told a news conference.
   The Seoul government has said it will jail Moon for his trip to
Pyongyang. South Koreans are prohibited from visiting the north
without government approval.
   Communist North Korea has warned that Moon's arrest would hamper
dialogue between the sides.
   In South Korean, authorities imprisoned two dissident leaders
Monday in an apparent crackdown on dissent connected to the Moon
visit. Moon said his wife told him by telephone Monday night that
his three sons also had been arrested. Reports from Seoul said the
sons were under investigation.
   Moon, 71, has been arrested several times for anti-government
activities since the 1970s. Asked why his sons had reportedly been
detained, he smiled and said ``they have the wrong father.''
   Moon arrived in the Chinese capital Monday after a nine-day
visit to North Korea. He said he planned to leave Wednesday for
Tokyo, but that he had not decided when he would return to Seoul.
   The English-language Korea Times reported today that South Korea
has asked Japan to deny Moon a visa. In Tokyo, Foreign Ministry
officials said Moon had been granted a transit visa that would
allow him to spend nine days in Japan.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not say
whether South Korea had requested that Moon be denied a visa. They
said that Moon's request was treated the same as any South Korean
civilian's.
   In Seoul, Justice Minister Huh Hyong-koo said today that Moon
would be arrested when he returns for violation of national
security law. South Korean officials say the trip aided the north
in its attempts to cause unrest and discredited the Seoul
government.
   Moon met for seven hours with North Korean President Kim Il Sung
for talks on reunifying the peninsula.
   ``I think the success of the visit was greater than I expected,
and I am very happy,'' Moon said.
   Moon said he was pleased by South Korean President Roh Tae-Woo's
statement on July 7 calling for talks with the north and ``thought
it was natural to go to the north and have a meeting.''
   He blamed the Seoul government for failing to come up with a
concrete plan for reunification and said his visit to Pyongyang
``was a great surprise to them (the Seoul government) so it's
natural for them to react very strongly. I think they will come to
their senses.''
   Moon, an adviser to South Korea's main dissident group, the
United National Democratic Movement, was invited to North Korea by
the governmental Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the
Fatherland.
   He was reunited with 18 members of his family living in the
North.
   North and South Korea have been bitter rivals since the division
of the peninsula in 1945, despite recent talks aimed at eventual
reunification.

   Former President Reagan credits the movie
``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' as the one that most affected his
life and led to his quest for the nation's highest office.
   ``I began to realize, through the power of that motion picture,
that one man can make a difference,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan made his statements as part of the all-star video gala to
celebrate the opening of the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park in
Florida. The salute will be broadcast April 30 on NBC-TV's
``Magical World of Disney.''
   World leaders, including British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, along with
celebrities such as Jimmy Stewart and Mickey Rooney will be
discussing the films that made deep impressions on them.
   Stewart starred in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' playing a
man who fought corruption in the Senate. The 1939 film became one
of the most beloved of director Frank Capra's optimistic fables.
   ``When Jimmy Stewart walked the halls of the Capitol building, I
walked with him,'' Reagan said. ``When he stood in awe of that
great man at the Lincoln Memorial, I bowed my head, too.''

   Publisher Peter Price has left the New York Post
just one year after joining a team that saved the morning tabloid
from the threat of closure.
   The paper's owner, real estate developer Peter Kalikow, said
Monday he accepted the resignation ``with regret'' and was taking
over the duties of publisher. A spokesman wouldn't say how long
Kalikow planned to serve as published.
   Price said he would be forming a partnership with Univisa, an
international company that produces and distributes television and
radio programming.
   Kalikow named Price as publisher last year after buying the
morning tabloid from Rupert Murdoch, saving the money-losing paper
from closing.
   Price said he was leaving the Post in good shape. The paper
started a Sunday edition last month.
   ``The financial losses have been stemmed and the paper should be
profitable by the end of 1989,'' Price said in a statement. ``Daily
circulation has increased by over 100,000 since the paper was
acquired'' and advertising linage is up.
   Kalikow said Price ``played a key role in taking a nearly
defunct afternoon newspaper with a circulation that had dropped as
low as 2 million a week and bringing it back to a strong newspaper
with a Sunday edition and a weekly circulation of over 4 million.''
   Price joined Time Inc. in 1965 and rose to assistant to the
publisher of Life magazine, circulation manager of Sports
Illustrated and director of corporate development for Time Inc. He
created the upscale Manhattan magazine Avenue in 1976.

Mississippi Valley early this morning, with strong thunderstorms
extending from western Kentucky to northeastern Texas.
   In Arkansas, thunderstorms spawned tornadoes Monday evening near
Amagon, Mount Ida, Jonesboro and Crystal Springs and golf ball-size
hail elsewhere. Strong winds downed trees and power lines in
southern Jefferson County.

   Cyclone Aivu swept across Queensland
today and authorities declared part of the state a disaster area
after two people died, 10 were injured and dozens of homes were

   The cyclone, packing 100 mph winds, began battering the east
coast as the country was recovering from three days of torrential
rains during which four people drowned and four others were missing.
   As the cyclone approached, the air force ordered a squadron of
fighter planes to move inland to avoid the storm.
   Police said one man died when his trailer was swept into a creek
near Ayr and another man died when his home was flattened in the
same town. Power and other services were cut.
   At least 10 people were injured by flying debris and 160 homes
were destroyed or badly damaged, police said. There were reports of
flooding, police said.
   Authorities declared the remote Burdekin tomato-growing and
fruit-producing region a disaster area.
   Earlier, rains dumped more than 12 inches in 24 hours and the
Weather Bureau said it was Sydney's wettest March in 26 years.

   After talks with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, a cheerful President Fidel Castro seemed pleased but was
non-committal about their discussions on issues that often have
left them deeply divided.
   ``Family-like,'' was how Castro described the talks after
bidding Gorbachev good night Monday on the steps of the
presidential palace.
   When reporters pressed him for details, Castro had ready a
two-word linguistic hybrid: ``glasnost manana.''
   That was Castro's way of saying more on the discussions will be
known when Gorbachev addresses the National Assembly late this
afternoon, the last major scheduled event during his 63-hour stay
in Cuba.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported today that
Gorbachev said improving the international climate is central to
his discussions with Castro.
   ``It is generally felt that there is mounting aspiration in the
world for better relations, and I think that the Soviet Union and
Cuba understand their responsibility,'' Gorbachev said.
   The report made no mention of differences between the two
leaders.
   Moments before Castro said good night Monday, Gorbachev
descended the steps of the ornate pre-revolutionary palace with his
wife, Raisa, at his side. They received applause from the diplomats
and officials who had joined them for a glittering reception.
   Aside from visits to two monuments and an exhibit highlighting
the achievements of the revolution, Gorbachev spent Monday with
Castro in talks.
   Speculation swirled all day about a possible Gorbachev
announcement forgiving Cuba its debt to the Soviet Union, estimated
at between $8 billion and $20 billion, but Castro said that issue
never came up.
   Debt, he said, is not a problem for Cuba but for other Latin
American countries. His answer did not appear to rule out a
Gorbachev announcement that he will give Cuba a break on debt
repayments.
   Combined with the estimated $6 billion Cuba owes Western
countries, the island is one of the most heavily indebted countries
in the world in per capital terms.
   Diplomats in Havana and in Moscow, speaking on condition of
anonymity, have said the Soviets already appear to have reduced the
subsidies they pay by buying Cuban sugar at
higher-than-world-market prices. And some said they expected
Gorbachev to tell Castro bluntly _ but in private _ that Cuba must
put its economic house in order.
   Ricardo Alarcon, Cuban vice foreign minister, said today that a
difference in views on economic policy ``doesn't necessarily mean
that you should have a confrontation or difference of other sort.''
   In an interview with ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Alarcon
also characterized Monday's talks as ``warm and friendly.''
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, Gorbachev's spokesman, said the morning
portion of the talks stressed Latin American debt and drug
trafficking.
   A Soviet official said Monday evening that Gorbachev might have
an announcement this afternoon relating to a Latin American issue,
but refused to be more specific.
   Gorbachev told the United Nations in December the Soviet Union
was prepared to offer the least-developed countries a moratorium on
debt service and ``in quite a few cases to write off the debt
altogether.''
   Castro has campaigned for years for cancellation of Latin
America's $420 billion foreign debt, declaring it is unpayable and
has contributed to economic decline throughout the hemisphere.
   The Cuban revolutionary leader seemed ebullient after Monday's
marathon talks, leaving no hint that any of the widely publicized
ideological problems with Gorbachev were impairing their
relationship.
   A Soviet official, insisting on anonymity, said Western reports
had been making too much of Soviet-Cuban differences.
   He said the Soviet goal is to de-emphasize ideology. But Castro
himself has been a stalwart supporter of maintaining communist
orthodoxy, criticizing Gorbachev for straying far afield with his
campaign for greater openness and a restructuring of the Soviet
economy.
   Gerasimov said Gorbachev explained to Castro the details of last
week's nationwide parliamentary elections, one of the most dramatic
symbols of the Soviet leader's reform program because they were the
country's first contested elections in seven decades.
   Gorbachev was to speak to the assembly today after visits to
local health and construction projects and a final meeting with
Castro in early afternoon.
   He is to leave for London on Wednesday morning.

   A French tour ship with 42 aboard
people caught fire on the Rhine River today, badly damaging the
vessel and injuring six passengers, officials said.
   Police and fire boats rescued all 34 passengers and eight crew
members from the burning Alsace 1, said Klaus van Beeck of the
North Rhine-Westphalia state Water Protection Police.
   ``Two people were hospitalized because of shock and four because
of smoke inhalation,'' van Beeck said by telephone from his office
in Wesel, about 25 east of the Dutch border.
   The Alsace 1 was near Wesel when the fire broke out. Two fire
boats fought the blaze, but police said the ship sustained major
damage.
   ``I don't know the exact amount of damage on board the boat, but
it was considerable,'' said van Beeck. He said the cause of the
fire was under investigation.
   According to van Beeck, the Alsace 1 is owned by the Alsace
Croizierez firm of Strasbourg.
   On Monday, a tanker loaded with fuel oil ran aground near
Oppenheim and spilled a small amount of its cargo into the Rhine.

   A suspected drug smuggler being chased by
federal agents set his plane on autopilot and bailed out, letting
the pilotless plane fly on for 180 miles before it crashed into the
Gulf of Mexico, officials said.
   Ronald Cox, 43, of Miami was arrested Monday and authorities
recovered 19 bales of marijuana from the wreckage, said U.S.
Customs Service spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   The plane was first picked up by radar about 140 miles southwest
of Key West, flying very low over the water toward Florida. A
Customs jet and a Coast Guard Falcon jet followed it for two hours,
Sheehan said.
   At times, up to five aircraft tailed the twin-engine Beechcraft
Travelair. After Cox bailed out over Sarasota, two Air Force F-15
fighter jets followed the plane ready to shoot it down if it
threatened a populated area.
   ``I guess it had a pretty good load of fuel in it,'' said Coast
Guard Lt.j.g. John Katinski.
   A Coast Guard cutter recovered the marijuana at the crash site
in the Gulf.

   Police arrested as many as 10 dissidents this
morning who planned a demonstration calling for reforms in Cuba
similar to those championed by visiting Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, a dissident said.
   Among those arrested was Samuel Martinez Lara, leader of the
Pro-Human Rights Party, said Elizardo Sanchez.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hector Argiles, said Martinez Lara
was arrested for engaging in unauthorized activities. Martinez
Lara, who was detained briefly and fined last week, had been
organizing a demonstration to be held tonight in front of the
Soviet Embassy.
   Sanchez said the demonstration was intended to support reforms
being carried out by Gorbachev and to request his backing for
similar policies in Cuba.
   Also arrested, Sanchez said, was Roberto Bahamonde, a member of
the Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation.
   Bahamonde called for capitalist reform in his unsuccessful bid
last month for a seat on a neighborhood council. It was believed to
be the first time a dissident ran for office since the revolution
30 years ago.

   For the couple standing vigil beside a
collapsed highway bridge, the waiting was harder than knowing if
their loved one was killed along with seven others when the
55-year-old span gave way.
   ``They brought up a piece of car that was the same color as
his,'' Paul Hurst said Monday as searchers continued looking for
victims in the rain-swollen Hatchie River.
   Seven bodies have been pulled from river since the bridge
collapsed Saturday night. But authorities continued their search
today, operating under the belief at least one more car is still
submerged.
   Hurst said his half-brother, Adrain Jones, 26, has not been seen
since shortly before a 90-foot section of the U.S. 51 bridge fell,
sending cars and a tractor trailer rig plunging 25 feet into the
water.
   ``He left the hospital and I went to Memphis the same time,''
said Hurst, who with his wife, Brenda, has been waiting beside the
river since they first heard of the bridge collapse a few hours
after the accident.
   ``He didn't make it. He was going back to Ripley because his
daddy was sick and he was going to stay with him.''
   Authorities said they, too, are working on the assumption that
Jones' car is somewhere in the dark, swirling water.
   Monday, a dog trained to sniff bodies appeared to find
something. Authorities resumed dragging operations this morning.
Divers were forced to wait because of strong currents in the river,
about 50 miles north of Memphis.
   Also Monday, workers began cutting up the three 28-foot bridge
spans. When the 100-ton concrete slabs are jackhammered into
manageable pieces, a crane will be brought in to remove them, said
Jim Thacker, regional manager of the Tennessee Emergency Management
Agency.
   Terry Petty, a diver with the Tennessee Highway Patrol, said
searchers were unsure what they will find under the slabs, two of
which are known to be lying on at least three cars and a tractor
trailer truck.
   ``Anything's possible,'' he said.
   Also, Petty said, it is unclear if any vehicles went into the
river but were not trapped by the falling slabs.
   ``I don't know. With this current, if a car went off after it
fell, it could be a mile down the river,'' he said.
   The cause of the collapse was unknown, but state Transportation
Commissioner Jimmy Evans said heavy spring floods following two
years of drought may have undercut a bridge support. Two
inspections during the last 18 months revealed no problems, he said.
   The collapse apparently began when a support holding up one of
the bridge sections gave way, said Jacky Carter, a state inspector.
   As the cars and the 18-wheeler plunged of the bridge, the other
two highway sections came crashing down on them, he said.
   Residents say they have worried about the safety of the bridge
for some time, but Lauderdale County Executive Bill Tucker said his
office has not received any such complaints.
   ``I've crossed that bridge many times every week and I've never
had any fear of it,'' he said. ``Obviously, they're going to
complain now.''
   The bridge, eight-tenths of a mile long, carries two northbound
lanes of U.S. 51 across the Hatchie about five miles north of
Covington.
   A companion bridge, built in the mid-1970s to carry the
southbound lanes, was unaffected but has been closed indefinitely
while state and federal officials investigate.
   Joseph Osterman, an investigator with the National
Transportation Safety Board, said it would take his agency several
months to file a report.

   A small-town mayor said today he has
pleaded guilty to federal charges of operating a gambling business
and agreed to resign his post by May 15.
   Baldwyn Mayor Merle Rowan, 67, and his wife, Robbie Rowan, 51,
entered the pleas Monday in U.S. District Court. Mike Price, 32,
Rowan's stepson, agreed to cooperate with federal authorities in
exchange for charges being dropped against him, authorities said.
   The three, along with Rowan's son, Larry Rowan, 22, were named
in a seven-count indictment in November charging they operated the
gambling business from 1985 to 1988.
   In a telephone interview from his office in city hall, Rowan
acknowledged that he had entered a plea. ``I'm in my third term, I
will be here through the 15th'' of May, Rowan said.
   Authorities charged that the family conspired and placed video
poker gambling machines at five businesses in Lee County. One of
the businesses, a bar and dance hall near Baldwyn, was established
by state agents as part of an undercover investigation into
gambling and other illegal activities.
   In exchange for the pleas from Rowan and his wife, no other
charges will be pursued, court records showed.
   Rowan has been mayor of Baldwyn, a northeast Mississippi town of
about 3,500, since 1977.
   Rowan also agreed to forfeit poker gambling machines and two
vehicles that authorities charged were used to further the gambling
operation.
   He faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. The plea
agreement stated that federal authorities would not oppose
probation for Mrs. Rowan. No date was set for sentencing.

   A retired Teledyne Electronics Inc.
executive testified today that he hired a Washington lobbyist on
the recommendation of Navy engineer Stuart Berlin.
   William Rosen, former vice president for marketing, testified
that Berlin, a Navy engineer who has pleaded guilty in the Pentagon
procurement scandal, recommended that he hire Michael Savaides as a
Washington lobbyist for the California-based aerospace company.
   Rosen said he was told by Berlin that Savaides was ``employed by
a company engaged in manufacturing and selling similar equipment.''
   ``You felt he knew his way around the Navy?'' asked prosecutor
Jack Hanly, and Rosen said yes.
   Berlin, who is expected to testify later, is cooperating with
the government investigation of the Pentagon procurement scandal,
which involved the payment of bribes and kickbacks to military
procurement officials and outside Pentagon consultants to obtain
procurement information and influence the award of lucrative
contracts.
   Rosen, testifying under an immunity grant at the bribery and
conspiracy trial of three Teledyne executives in U.S. District
Court, also told how he was angered when told that Washington
defense consultant William L. Parkin was working, without his
knowledge, to help Teledyne obtain a Navy contract.
   ``You might say I became angry,'' Rosen testified, recalling
that he went to see Eugene R. Sullivan, one of the defendants, and
``expressed my outrage over meddling in my department.''
   Rosen said he learned that Parkin was working for Teledyne from
Fred H. Lackner, another defense consultant who, like Parkin, has
pleaded guilty and is expected to testify as a prosecution witness
in the case.
   Recalling the events of the fall of 1985, Rosen said that
Sullivan initially told him he was ``not prepared to discuss it.
The only thing he said was he did not engage a consultant.''
   Sullivan and two other Teledyne executives are defendants in the
first trial of the Justice Department ``Ill Wind'' investigation
into Pentagon procurement fraud.
   Prosecutors are trying to prove that the three conspired to
bribe a public official for information that helped their company
win a $24 million contract.
   The three defendants _ Sullivan, George Kaub, Dale Schnittjer _
were executives with Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif.,
a division of Teledyne Industries. Lawyers for the men, who are
charged with bribery, conspiracy and making false statements, say
their clients have done nothing wrong.
   ``This is a case about bribing, about cheating, about lying,''
charged Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert DeHenzel Jr. in his opening
arguments Monday.
   The three are accused of conspiring to bribe a Navy official to
influence the award of a hand-held radar testing device for the
Navy.
   Rosen testified, he met Parkin at a meeting in Sullivan's office
that was also attended by Kaub. The meeting was held to discuss
hiring Parkin to help Teledyne get the contract, Rosen said.
   Parkin told the Teledyne officials ``he knew his way around the
Navy, that he could do a job for us.''
   Rosen said that Parkin wanted a written agreement which he
described as ink on paper to formalize his consulting relationship
with Teledyne. In return ``he would take measures to assure the
contract would be awarded to Teledyne Electronics.''
   The agreement called for Parkin to receive $10,000 in advance
for expenses and $150,000 as a reward once Teledyne obtained the
contract.
   Rosen said he later expressed misgivings to Sullivan about the
agreement with Parkin. Recalling a conversation on a golf course,
Rosen said he told Sullivan, ``I think we were being foolish. I
thought we were being ripped off.''
   Asked how Sullivan replied, Rosen said, ``He said I was just as
involved as everybody else.''
   At Monday's opening day of the trial the first witness was
Charles Jones, an Air Force contracting officer.
   On the witness stand, Jones discussed the 25-month process that
led to the Pentagon's decision in July 1987 to sign with Teledyne
Electronics a contract to make hand-held radar test equipment.
   DeHenzel argued the three defendants were part of a conspiracy
that included bribing Berlin to receive inside information crucial
to winning the contract.
   He said Berlin provided information about another competitor
that should have been kept secret.
   ``A lot of information should not have been given to anyone
outside government,'' he said.
   Berlin also spoke during internal Pentagon discussions in favor
of a position that benefited Teledyne, he said. Specifically, the
former Navy official opposed limiting the contract to small
businesses, a decision that would have excluded Teledyne from
bidding. That decision was ultimately reversed.
   Teledyne Industries, Parkin, Lackner and Berlin were all named
in the indictment returned by a grand jury in January. They pleaded
guilty and are cooperating with the government. Savaides also
pleaded guilty, but he was not indicted.
   The defendants' lawyers said their clients never knew about a
secret deal that Parkin made with his associates. Kaub, Sullivan
and Schnittjer believed Parkin used legitimate methods to obtain
information about contracts, a time-honored practice, they said.
   ``The conspiracy in this case was directed as much as concealing
from Teledyne as defrauding the government,'' said George
O'Connell, Sullivan's lawyer.
   Mark Tuohey, Kaub's attorney, described the deal between Parkin
and his associates as a ``conspiracy of silence.''
   Kaub was Teledyne Electronics' executive vice president dealing
with government contracts. Sullivan and his successor, Schnittjer,
were also executive vice presidents.
   As part of the evidence, prosecutors have said they will play
tapes from conversations between Parkin and his associates. The
government taped the telephone calls as part of their investigation.
   The coast-to-coast investigation into the Pentagon's
$150-billion-a-year purchasing system began nearly three years, but
it was not publicly revealed until June 1988.

<HEAD>Bank President Who Became Bank Robber Dead at 70</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawrence Pope, who went from bank president
to bank robber and later became a prison reform activist, has died.
He was 70.
   Pope collapsed and died on a downtown street corner Monday. The
cause of death was cardiac arrest, said a spokeswoman for
Brackenridge Hospital.
   Pope started his banking industry career in the 1930s as an
office boy at a Dallas bank. He eventually became president of West
National Bank in West, Texas, 65 miles south of Dallas.
   After he was eased out of the job, he thought his banking
partners had cheated him. He began robbing banks in October 1960,
armed with a .38-caliber snub-nosed revolver. Records do not
indicate how many robberies he was involved in.
   ``I was out to get bankers,'' Pope said in a 1982 interview. ``I
was going after them as long as I could.''
   His career as a bank robber ended when he was arrested near San
Antonio in November 1960 and sentenced the next spring to 50 years
in prison.
   Pope wound up serving 21 years in prison before he was paroled
in June 1982.
   ``He spent so much time in prison that he had an incredible view
of life in Texas prisons,'' said John Wheat, sound archives
coordinator at the Barker Texas History Center at the University of
Texas.
   Pope filed an estimated 200 lawsuits while he was in prison,
most on behalf of other inmates.

   Heavy rains battered Tennessee, Missouri and Arkansas today
after spawning tornadoes that ripped roofs from buildings and
homes. A toddler swept from his mother's arms was presumed drowned
in floodwaters and an Indiana woman apparently was electrocuted.
   Much of Arkansas was under a tornado watch early today; the
mayor in Fargo, N.D., declared a state of emergency after the Red
River overflowed its banks; and ski resorts in Colorado reveled
after an 18-inch snowfall.
   Severe thunderstorms blew through western Tennessee on Monday,
demolishing part of an aluminum processing processing plant in Mt.
Pleasant. Tornadoes followed the storm and destroyed homes and
uprooted buildings, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported, said Roy Chaffin, a Mount Pleasant
police dispatcher.
   The storms were accompanied by hail, rain and spectacular
lightening. Many areas reported downed trees, signs, roof damage
and electrical failures.
   At least two tornadoes touched down in southeastern Missouri,
ripping roofs off farm buildings and blowing over a mobile home,
authorities said.
   A tornado was sighted just south of Poplar Bluff, but no
injuries were reported, said Tina Barnett, a Butler County
sheriff's dispatcher.
   Tornadoes were spotted throughout Arkansas late Monday, but
there were no reports of injuries or serious damage.
   However, the National Weather Service placed most of the state _
65 of Arkansas' 75 counties _ under a tornado watch that ended
early today.
   In Indiana, officials resumed their search today for a
16-month-old boy swept from his mother's arms as she tried to get
him to safety.
   The 35-year-old mother told police she had just picked up her
children from a babysitter and was going home when her car stalled
on a gravel road in southern Indiana.
   By the time the floodwaters reached the window, she was able to
get her 4- and 5-year-old child out of the car, said Capt. Rick
Barr of the Gibson County Sheriff's Department.
   The woman thought she had the toddler in her arms, but he was
swept away, Barr said.
   An Evansville woman either drowned or was electrocuted in 5
inches of water on the city's northside, police said. An autopsy
was scheduled today on Gretchen Brown, 27, who was found by police
at 2:15 a.m.
   A utility pole was near her body and Southern Indiana Gas and
Electric Co. workers measured 180 volts in a fence nearby.
   A tornado Monday at Grayville in southern Illinois toppled trees
and utility poles, overturned cars and trucks and tore metal roofs
off of barns. Baseball-sized hail clunked down on the community of
2,000 people.
   In Fargo, Mayor Jon Lindgren said he was surprised by the speed
with which runoff from melting snow and rain sent the Red River
over its banks.
   ``It did really catch everyone by surprise ... a new twist of
events,'' he said. ``Of course, we know that's true during the
thaw. If the temperature goes outside a standard deviation range
and you get a little rain on top of it, it just changes instantly.''
   Lindgren declared a state of emergency, clearing the way for
construction of temporary dikes and the leasing of pumps to fend
off flood waters.
   Up river, hundreds of volunteers filled sandbags to shore up
dikes in Breckenridge, Minn., and neighboring Wahpeton, where
flooding caused by ice jams, runoff and rain threatened low-lying
areas.
   Ski resort operators in Colorado were happy following a six-day
storm that left up to 5 feet of snow in the mountains. The storm
did cause intermittent road problems and left the avalanche danger
high.
   The storm brought 18 inches to some areas on Monday, temporarily
closing Vail Pass.
   ``For this time of year, to have this kind of a sustained snow,
is very rare,'' said Knox Williams, forecaster with the Colorado
Avalanche Information Center. ``The storms usually hit and get out
within 24 or 48 hours.

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak defended the
scope and pace of his nation's economic reforms today and told
members of Congress that Egypt needs continued high levels of U.S.
economic assistance.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine described the
90-minute private meeting between Mubarak and 15 senators as ``very
beneficial and fruitful'' but said commitments on the aid issue
were neither sought nor given.
   Both Mitchell and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas
said senators told the Egyptian president that the United States
must keep the large U.S. budget deficit in mind in dealing with all
requests for economic and military assistance.
   Mitchell said senators appeared favorably impressed with
Mubarak's description of Egypt's economic reform program, including
the reduction of subsidies on a number of consumer products and
revisions in the country's tax structure.
   Mitchell was asked if senators were satisfied at the pace of the
Mubarak program.
   ``Obviously every national leader confronts the same general
problem of the pace of economic reform,'' he replied. ``We confront
a similar problem in dealing with our budget deficit.''
   ``The president argued that the pace he is pursuing is the one
most appropriate to their circumstances and the one most likely to
bring success,'' Mitchell said.
   On another subject, Dole said Mubarak flatly denied reports that
Egypt intends to acquire chemical weapons and said he was ``quite
angry about being lumped in'' with such nations as Libya, which is
widely believed to be ready to produce such weapons.
   Mubarak met on Monday with President Bush who said he has set as
U.S. goals in the Middle East an end to Israel's occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza and fulfillment of political rights for the 1.2
million Palestinian Arabs who live in the territories.
   Bush also reaffirmed a U.S. commitment to Israel's security and
said all the goals were shared by Egypt.
   The statement appears to put pressure on Israel in advance of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's talks here Wednesday and Thursday.
   But Mubarak, answering questions from the floor at a dinner
Monday night, said he was not asking the Bush administration to
pressure Israel. ``Exerting pressure won't solve anything,''
Mubarak said.
   Mubarak, in the second day of his visit, also met today
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady.
   The Egyptian leader is hoping Congress will approve new weapons
sales once they are formally proposed by the Bush administration
and that $230 million in U.S. economic aid will be released. The
aid was withheld in March pending reforms in the way Egypt manages
its economy which that country must have in place by June.
   Bush did not spell out the political rights he seeks for the
Palestinians who live on the West Bank and in Gaza. Nor did he
amplify his call for an end to Israeli occupation of the
territories lost by the Arabs in the Middle East War of 1967.
   The president put his position this way: ``Egypt and the United
States share the goals of security for Israel, the end of the
occupation, and achievement of Palestinian political rights.''
   Bush went on to say that a ``properly structured international
conference could play a useful role at an appropriate time'' in
reaching those goals through negotiations.
   In Nicosia, Cyprus, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's chief adviser
welcomed Bush's statement as an ``important and serious
development.''
   Bassam Abu Sharif told The Associated Press the Palestine
Liberation Organization feels ``this will give a real push for
peace efforts in the Middle East.''
   But in Jerusalem, Shamir indicated that during his U.S. visit he
will state his opposition to an end to Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip and Bush's endorsement of an international
peace conference.
   Mubarak has been pushing for a Mideast conference for years. A
U.S. official said the Egyptian leader had the end of the year or
early 1990 in mind.
   ``We believe there is a lot of ground that has to be covered
before there could be a conference,'' the official told reporters
at the White House. He answered their questions under rules that
shielded his identity.
   All U.S. administrations since 1967 have said Israel should
yield land on the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for peace. But
none has specified whether the United States would urge its ally to
yield all the territory.
   The resolutions approved by the U.N. Security Council in 1967
and in 1973 after the Yom Kippur war were intentionally vague on
this point.
   Bush did not specify whether his administration was demanding
total Israeli withdrawal.
   Another U.S. official, who also demanded anonymity, said ``there
was nothing new'' in Bush's statement and ``I didn't see anything
new.''
   Shamir, who arrives Wednesday in Washington, will propose
holding elections among the Palestinians in the territories to find
leaders who would negotiate their future with Israel.
   But Mubarak told Bush that elections held under Israeli
supervision were unacceptable to the Palestinians, the U.S.
official who briefed reporters said.
   Evidently Bush did not reject the idea out of hand. The official
said the president had raised questions about various forms of
supervision.
   A revolt by Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza that began in
December 1987 has led to the death of 419 Arabs and 18 Israelis.
Shamir holds the Palestine Liberation Organization partly
responsible for the uprising.
   Mubarak told Bush he doubted PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat could
control the violence, the official said.

<TEXT>
   The owner of a winery has been ordered
to pay $100 a week in fines because he did not plant enough grape
vines on his property.
   The town of Southampton says Alan Barr, who owns Le Reve winery,
was required to plant vines by April 1 on all 55 acres he owns in
Water Mill and Southampton. He now has vines planted on 33 acres.
   Town attorney John Bennett said the town wants to keep Barr from
erecting a large wine factory on the land, which is in the middle
of a residential area.
   The money to pay the fine will be taken from a $5,000 bond Barr
posted in 1986 when the town planning board approved his plan to
build the winery, Bennett said.
   Barr said he wanted to plant all 55 acres but an upstate nursery
refused to deliver vines without being paid $30,000 in advance.
Other nurseries were short on grapevines and it might be another
year before he can plant more vines on his land, he said.

   A former colleague of Oliver North testified
today that responses North was preparing for House members on
Contra assistance did not appear to be accurate.
   Vincent Michael Cannistraro recounted for the jury in North's
U.S. District Court trial a conversation in September 1985 in which
North shared some of the responses he was preparing for House
members asking about reports he was assisting the Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``He showed you some of his answers?'' asked prosecutor John
Keker.
   ``I asked him if they were accurate and they did not appear to
be so,'' responded Cannistraro, who at the time worked with North
at the National Securiy Council.
   Recalling Cannistraro's previously secret testimony before a
federal grand jury, Keker asked, ``Did you do anything?'' in the
conversation with North after seeing the responses.
   When Cannistraro balked at answering Keker, the prosecutor put
his hand up to his nose and then stretched out his arm in a gesture
reminiscent of the tale of Pinocchio, a puppet whose nose grew
longer when he lied.
   ``Not that long,'' responded Cannistraro, as the courtroom
erupted in laughter.
   North is accused of lying to Congress in 1985 by allegedly
preparing letters signed by then-national security adviser Robert
McFarlane denying the National Security Council staff was assisting
the Contras.
   The denials came amid a two-year congressional ban on military
aid to the rebel force.
   Cannistraro recalled a comment by a CIA official, ``that
whatever Ollie was doing he was bound to get us all in a lot of
trouble and he wanted to stay far away from him.''
   ``Was Colonel North considered a trustworthy person'' by his
colleagues at the NSC?, asked Keker.
   ``I had considered Colonel North a trustworthy person, but there
were occasions'' when there were questions ``about some of the
things he told us,'' Cannistraro said after pausing.
   Keker then read portions of Cannistraro's grand jury testimony
in 1987 in which he said that ``with Colonel North you never could
be certain if what he was telling us was true or fantasy or
deliberately meant to mislead.
   ``My practice was to take everything with four grains of salt,''
Cannistraro testified to the grand jury in 1987.
   Keker also revealed that Cannistraro made no mention in his 1987
grand jury appearance of his assertion Monday that CIA Director
William Casey said President Reagan had designated North as the man
who would assist the Contras.
   Cannistraro defended the omission by saying he wasn't asked
about it. But Keker read questions from the prosecutor at the time
in which Cannistraro was asked for all details pertaining to
meetings concerning the Contras.
   Cannistraro stuck to his story that no prosecutor had asked him
about the meeting, despite Keker's suggestion that Cannistraro was
either inventing the testimony about Reagan or had covered up in
1987.
   ``Mr. Casey ... said he had discussed this with the president of
the United States ... and this was how it should be handled,''
Cannistraro testified.
   Cannistraro, one of the first witnesses called by North, is the
first to state outright that Reagan had chosen North to work for
the Contras.
   Cannistraro was also one of the first witnesses called by North
as the former White House aide began his defense Monday on charges
of lying to Congress and White House officials about his role in
assisting the Nicaraguan rebels.
   At the meeting in Casey's office, the CIA director said North as
an NSC staffer wouldn't be subject to a congressional prohibition
on aiding the Contras, Cannistraro testified. Casey said North was
to become the ``principal point of reference,'' according to
Cannistraro.
   Congress banned U.S. intelligence agencies from assisting the
Contras as of October 1984.
   Former national security adviser Robert McFarlane has testified
he was the one who directed North and an NSC colleague ``to do
everything they could'' to keep the Contras functioning and their
morale up.
   Reagan told the Tower Commission, which investigated the
Iran-Contra affair, on Jan. 26, 1987, that ``he did not know that
the NSC staff was engaged in helping the Contras.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government said today it freed
three military commanders who led a failed coup attempt. Mutinous
soldiers surrendered control of the airport and returned to their
barracks.
   State television announced Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of
the Leopards Battalion; Col. Phillipe Biamby, commander of the
presidential guard; and Col. Leonce Qualo, an administrative
officer at army headquarters, were given safe passage to the United
States.
   A government communique identified Rebu, Biamby and Qualo as
leaders of what it called a ``foolhardy'' attempt Sunday to
overthrow the government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   The president ``magnanimously'' decided to release the officers
and they were escorted to the border of the Dominican Republic on
Monday night to get a flight to an undisclosed city in the United
States, the communique said. Rebu was accompanied by his wife and
four children.
   The government did not explain why the three men were freed, but
the move was clearly meant to defuse resistance within the Leopards
Battalion. At least four mutinous soldiers in the battalion were
killed Monday in skirmishes with troops loyal to Avril. The rebels
were demanding Rebu's release.
   Independent Radio Haiti-Inter said rebel units of the Leopards
Battalion withdrew Monday night from the Port-au-Prince airport,
but the airport remained closed. Schools also were closed for a
second day.
   Avril assumed power six months ago in a coup led by
non-commissioned officers who said they were disgusted by official
corruption and human rights abuses.
   On Monday night, presidential guardsmen in tanks battled
Leopards commandos on a main throughfare between the airport and
downtown Port-au-Prince.
   Radio stations gave conflicting casualty reports, saying four to
eight Leopards were killed and several wounded.
   Nine members of an independent council appointed to organize and
schedule presidential elections were to be sworn in today, but the
ceremony was postponed until Thursday because of the violence,
officials said.
   Avril said in February he was forming the council, an
announcement many Haitians welcomed as a sign of democratic times
to come.
   The leader of this impoverished Caribbean nation has promised
elections and pointed as proof he is keeping his pledge to the
council, which is to include representatives of the Roman Catholic
Church, labor unions, the military, human rights groups, the media
and judiciary.
   Rebel soldiers made three demands over Radio Haiti-Inter on
Monday. They said they wanted Rebu released, a civilian government
installed and total restoration of a 1987 constitution restricting
the army's role in government. Those parts of the constitution were
suspended in June.
   Radio Haiti-Inter cited sources close to the police command as
reporting that Avril had determined a ``handful of soldiers and
officers were involved'' in Sunday's coup attempt.
   Avril said on nationwide television early Monday that the coup
was led by ``some members of the armed forces, blinded by their
exhorbitant ambitions,'' but gave no details.
   Avril was seized early Sunday by rebel troops, but rescued by
loyal forces later in the day. No casualties were reported Sunday.
   There was speculation the coup attempt may have been linked to
Avril's crackdown on drug trafficking by the military. Last week,
four high-ranking army officers were accused of drug dealing and
arrested.
   The troops that installed Avril as president ousted Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy on Sept. 17, 1988. Namphy had led the country for most
of the time since a February 1986 popular uprising forced dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier into exile, ending 30 years of Duvalier family
rule.
   U.S. officials have conditioned the restoration of $70 million
in suspended economic aid on Haiti moving toward democracy,
respecting human rights, and cracking down on the drug trade. The
funds were suspended after thugs massacred 34 voters in November
1987, aborting Haiti's first elections in 30 years.

   Riot police firing tear gas charged
onto a university campus and into a housing complex Tuesday to put
down violent anti-government protests in two cities.
   In Ulsan, about 150 miles south of Seoul, thousands of workers
hurling firebombs and rocks fought riot police to protest a
crackdown on strikers at Hyundai Heavy Industries, the nation's
largest shipyard, news reports said.
   About 3,000 riot police stormed a complex of 150 high-rise
apartments, a stronghold of militant stikers, after battling 5,000
workers and radical students on the streets, according to the South
Korean news agency Yonhap.
   Television footage showed protesters yelling and throwing rocks
and firebombs from apartment balconies and roofs. Rocks rained down
on police, who retaliated with tear gas.
   The Korean Broadcasting System said police retreated after
several hours of battles that left about 60 police and workers
injured. Police gave no figures on arrests or injuries in the six
days of protest.
   Fighting has taken place daily in Ulsan since March 30 when
14,000 riot police stormed the shipyard to end a 109-day strike by
5,000 of the company's 19,500 workers who broke off from the
company union.
   Militant workers demanded more pay and better working
conditions. Hyundai officials say non-striking workers have been
assaulted and attacked leaving the yard and the workforce has
steadily declined. On Tuesday, about half the workers showed up.
   Stores, banks and schools near the shipyard must close part of
every day as fighting erupts. Hyundai officials worry the labor
unrest will spread to subsidiaries.
   Hyundai, one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, makes cars,
steel, electronics and other products, and employs 100,000 people
in Ulsan.
   Radical students attacked four Hyundai offices in three cities,
burning two cars and breaking windows, Yonhap said.
   In western Seoul, police in visored helmets stormed the campus
of Yonsei University, firing tear gas to disperse an
anti-government rally by 1,000 students. In the last two years,
police have stayed on the perimeters of colleges and fought
students mostly in and around school gates.
   The students burned an effigy of President Roh Tae-woo, then
drove police back by hurling firebombs and rocks. They shouted:
``Down with Roh Tae-woo, who blocks unification and stifles
workers' rights!''
   The fighting continued about an hour, and police said more than
400 students from other colleges were arrested for trying to enter
Yonsei to take part in the protest after school gates had been
sealed off by thousands of police. One student was injured in the
head by police hurling rocks.
   The students were protesting the police action in Ulsan and
supporting the trip to North Korea by a dissident, the Rev. Moon
Ik-kwan.
   Moon's unauthorized visit has provoked controversy in South
Korea, where government officials say he was serving interests of
communist North Korea. It has sparked a government crackdown on
dissidents, with security officials arresting Moon's colleagues and
questioning others.
   Security agencies and police raided dissident offices and homes
Monday. Dissidents alleged the government was using Moon's trip as
an excuse to crack down on dissent.
   Radicals students are a vocal minority with little public
support.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon finished pumping 42 million gallons
of crude oil from the crippled Exxon Valdez today and planned to
refloat the tanker 12 days after the wreck that caused the nation's
worst oil spill.
   Exxon Shipping Co. plans to refloat the tanker Wednesday and
take it to Portland, Ore., for repairs, but port officials there
said they were uncertain about accepting it, even though the $12
million repair bill would provide about 200 jobs.
   ``We're not willing to trade in the environment for jobs,'' port
spokesman Darrel Buttice said Monday.
   The 1.1 million barrels of oil remaining after the accident have
been pumped from eight ruptured tanks into three ships over the
past week. Exxon Shipping President Frank Iarossi said boats and
booms will tag along as the tanker is refloated to prevent any
spread of residual oil.
   Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, who was fired and charged
with being drunk at the time of the disastrous accident, made plans
to surrender today near his hometown of Huntington, N.Y., said New
York State Trooper Craig Rubio.
   Hazelwood, 42, is accused of misdemeanor charges of operating
the ship while under the influence of alcohol, reckless
endangerment and negligent discharge of oil.
   On Monday, the spill forced officials to close the $12 million
herring fishery for the season.
   The fishery is where fishermen go after herring just as the fish
are about to spawn at the start of the Prince William Sound fishing
season. More than half the herrings' spawning habitat was polluted.
   ``It means they don't have a fishery, and it means they have to
come up with another means of making a living,'' said Jack Lamb,
president of the Cordova District Fishermen United. The fishermen
will be eligible for compensation from Exxon.
   Other fishermen, meanwhile, worried that the spreading slick
will shut down even more lucrative salmon fishing this summer. The
region's fishing industry is worth $150 million a year.
   The ship has leaked oil since the Good Friday accident, when the
vessel crashed into Bligh Reef and spilled more than 10 million
gallons of oil.
   Fishermen have formed the backbone of the cleanup, using their
boats to pull containment booms across bays near salmon streams and
sensitive fish hatcheries.
   At Sawmill Bay, the hardest-hit hatchery in the sound and home
to 2 million salmon, currents pushed oil against the booms. A light
sheen made its way past barriers.
   The hatchery holds more than 2 million salmon fry, which can be
poisoned by small amounts of oil. Hatchery manager Eric Prestegard
said they may have to airlift the fish fry to clean water, a double
whammy to fishermen who fund the hatcheries through surcharges on
their catch.
   More than 1,000 seabirds and at least 30 sea otters caught in
the oil have died. Some were found covered with asphalt-hard oil.
Officials said the death toll is probably much higher, but they
have had time to survey only a small portion of the sound's 2,500
miles of coastline.
   ``Every day, it's getting a little worse,'' otter rescue
specialist Chris Donohoe said as he squatted by a dead duck. ``You
clean a beach up, the tide changes, and the oil comes right back.''
   Department of Fish and Game spokesman Jon Lyman said a deer
found dead on Naked Island about 25 miles southwest of Bligh Reef
apparently had eaten contaminated food, an indication of how
rapidly the spill was spreading.
   ``That's bad news. That's the top of the food chain,'' Lyman
said.
   On nearby Green Island, hundreds of birds lay along the beach,
as black and lifeless as the oil-smeared rocks around them.
   In other developments:
   _Flow through the pipeline was increased, but remained below
normal levels. The accident forced restrictions on tankers in
Valdez harbor, the only port for the Trans-Alaska pipeline, which
carries nearly one-quarter of the United States' domestic supply of
crude oil.
   _In an interview in New York, Exxon President Lee R. Raymond
said he hopes the ``emotional type of atmosphere'' generated by the
spill does not prompt Congress to reject the oil industry's request
to drill in protected wildlife areas.
   That's exactly what could happen, U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan suggested in Washington.
   ``If the image of an uncareful and uncaring industry prevails
among the U.S. public, then we can kiss goodbye the domestic oil
and gas development in (the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge),
offshore and in the public lands,'' Lujan said.
   _Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the House
subcommittee with jurisdiction over the pipeline, planned to fly to
Alaska to examine the damage from the spill, which has grown larger
than Rhode Island.
   ``The oil spill has raised many serious questions about the
ability of the industry to safely operate in a fragile
environmental area,'' said Miller, whose House Interior
subcommittee will consider legislation that would allow exploration
for more oil on Alaska's North Slope.
   U.S. Sen. Frank Murkowski, a champion of oil exploration in
Alaska, asked that plans for drilling in Bristol Bay, the state's
richest fishing grounds, be set aside until the industry can
demonstrate that it can respond effectively to spills.
   ``The Exxon Valdez accident has taught us that simply having a
plan is not sufficient,'' the Alaska Republican said.
   Oil is so thick that walking on once pristine beaches is
treacherous, and workers wear hardhats to protect against injuries
from frequent tumbles on rocks. Beaches smell like gas station
garages.

   A child molester serving a 34-year
prison sentence is suing his victims, alleging he is unable to find
a new job and has suffered humiliation, anxiety and loss of health.
   John Taylor Booz, 62, filed a $2 million damage lawsuit March 28
in state district court.
   Defendants include two youths he was convicted of molesting.
Other defendants include a boy whose allegations were rejected by a
jury and members of at least two of the boys' families.
   Booz alleged that he lost his job as a salesman and cannot find
a new job in his field because of a conspiracy and accusations by
the people he sued.
   He alleged he has lost earnings and earning capacity ``into the
indeterminate future'' and has suffered ``extreme humiliation,
anxiety and loss of health.''
   District Attorney Robert Schwartz said he would defend the
families.
   He said he ``will not allow a convicted child molester to
revictimize the victims. ... I will do my best to see that this
legal assault comes to as final a conclusion as the sexual
assault.''
   Schwartz said he determined that neither the New Mexico Crime
Victims Reparation Commission nor the Risk Management Division can
cover legal expenses for the families, so he will provide the
defense.
   Booz was convicted Sept. 4, 1987, of 11 counts of criminal
sexual contact of a minor and one count of child enticement. His
conviction was upheld on appeal.
   The boys were about 10 to 11 years old at the time, Chief Deputy
District Attorney Michael Cox, who prosecuted the case, said Monday.

   A domestic jetliner carrying 130 people
crash-landed in flames at a jungle airport, the government news
agency said today. It said 14 people were injured, but reported no
deaths.
   The Faucett Airlines Boeing 737 crashed at 6:43 p.m. Monday at
the airport in Iquitos, after a flight from Lima, 715 miles away,
the Andina news agency said.
   The jet tilted sideways before touching down on the runway, and
one engine burst into flames, Andina said. The nose of the aircraft
rammed into the runway and both wings tore off as the jet skidded
off the runway.
   Andina said the 130 passengers and crew members scrambled off
the jet _ some leaving the plane before it came to a halt _ as
flames reached the fuselage.
   Fourteen people were injured, some with second-degree burns and
others as a result of jumping from the plane, the agency said.
   The body of the jet was destroyed by the fire, it said.
   Officials at Iquitos airport blamed the crash landing on
``unfavorable climatic conditions and strong tropical rains,''
Andina reported.
   Repeated calls to Faucett Airlines went unanswered today.
   In the last serious airplane accident in Peru, 12 people were
killed when a jetliner of the state-owned airline Aeroperu crashed
on takeoff in October in the highland city of Puno.

   Bush, using a Rose Garden ceremony on the actual anniversary of
the treaty to announce his trip, also said he would ``visit allied

   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would
attend the NATO session on May 29 and May 30. The president will

either June 1 or June 2.
   The president, addressing a group of amabassadors from NATO
countries, said the alliance ``not only keeps the peace and freedom
of the Atlantic world, it has made possible the common effort to
build a more constructive relationship with the East.''
   ``By any standard, NATO has been a resounding success,'' Bush
said.

<HEAD>April in Paris: Snow in the Blossoms</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto PAR2</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frigid weather chilled France on Tuesday, bringing
Paris its first snowfall since the winter of 1987-88.
   The blustering cold followed days of balmy weather crowned by
spring blossoms that started sprouting a week ago as temperatures
soared to the 70s.
   Tuesday's early morning temperatures hovered around freezing in
the northern half of the country with gusts of wind reaching 30 mph.
   The snow coated trees and lawns but did not disrupt morning
traffic because it melted as soon as it hit the streets.
   The Paris weather bureau said the impression that a cold wave
had struck stemmed from the contrast between the freezing
temperatures and the warm weather last week. Forecasters said snow
and cold temperatures are normal for early April in the northern
part of the country.
   In the south, in Provence and along the French Riviera, where
there was concern about the lack of moisture, one-half to nearly 2
inches of rain fell in the past 24 hours. Rain also fell in the
Pyrenees along the Spanish border.
   In the English Channel, winds gusted up to 50 mph and waves of
20 feet were reported off the Channel Islands.
   Snow and sleet hit Belgium, chilling residents who also had been
enjoying warm weather. Temperatures dropped to 36 degrees and the
winds picked up.
   Over the weekend, Belgian beaches saw the first sunbathers in
swimsuits and the public parks were full of families enjoying
68-degree temperatures.
   But on Tuesday, the weather office reported more than an inch of
snow _ the first in more than a year _ in central Belgium.
   Forecasters said temperatures were expected to warm up again
later this week.

<TEXT>
   Travelers using Lambert Airport faced long
delays and cancellations early this week because of fog,
thunderstorms and a radar malfunction, but the weather cleared and
operations were normal today.
   Lambert can land from 60 to 84 planes an hour, but because of
poor weather and the radar problem, that figure was reduced to 36
on Sunday and Monday, traffic manager Sam Smith said.
   Smith said the weekend weather forecast was favorable when the
decision was made last week to replace a radar antenna. The switch
was made Saturday, but a ``glitch'' blitzed the system Sunday
morning. The local radar went down, and Lambert had to rely on an
auxiliary system piped in from Kansas City.
   Bad weather forced the Federal Aviation Administration to put a
``ground hold'' on Lambert, meaning planes in other airports were
not allowed to take off if their destination was Lambert.

<TEXT>
   A barge loaded with 160,000 gallons of
lye ran aground and capsized in the Ohio River, but officials said
there was no immediate threat to wildlife or water supplies.
   The barge was one of 15 being transported by a tugboat around a
sharp bend when it broke away and ran aground near the rocky shore,
said Lt. Commander Arthur Adkins of the U.S. Coast Guard at
Huntington.
   The accident occurred about 20 miles southwest of Parkersburg at
Long Bottom, Ohio, and Murraysville, W.Va., near where a barge also
carrying lye ran aground two years ago.
   A salvage expert from PPG Industries Inc., the barge's owner,
was expected to arrive at the scene today, Adkins said. Cleanup and
removal of the barge was expected to take weeks.
   No leaks were detected, Adkins said, but small amounts of the
lye solution, known as sodium hydroxide or caustic soda, may be
seeping through vents in the barge.
   Coast Guard Lt. Kevin Maehler said this morning that preliminary
water tests showed little of the lye had escaped the barge.
   Lye is considered hazardous because it is highly alkaline. In
high concentrations such as the amount the barge was carrying, lye
will burn skin and eyes and can be dangerous if swallowed, Adkins
said.
   ``Drinking water could be infected, so water intake users
downstream have been notified,'' Adkins said.
   Because of the swift current, it would take a major leak to
endanger aquatic life or drinking water, said Ron Sandy, the West
Virginia Department of Natural Resource's field staff supervisor.
   ``If there was any significant leakage, we would have seen some
dead aquatic life,'' Sandy said. ``There didn't seem to be any.''
   The accident didn't tie up river traffic, officials said.
Workers kept the upturned hull of the barge illuminated throughout
Monday night, Maehler said.
   Strong currents were blamed for the April 9, 1987, grounding of
a PPG barge with 200,000 gallons of lye. No leaks were reported
from that incident.

   The fight to save oil-fouled Prince
William Sound's $100 million salmon run from ruin comes down to a
fish hatchery tucked away in this pretty little bay.
   ``If we lose San Juan Hatchery, we lose it all,'' said Jack
Lamb, the acting president of Cordova District Fishermen United.
San Juan is owned by the Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corp.
   San Juan, because it is close to the oil-free waters of the
ocean, has the best chance of any to survive and produce the pink
salmon needed to replenish the oil-killed stocks, Lamb said Monday.
   That's why 25 fishing boats and sleepless crews from the fishing
town of Cordova are struggling to hold back the huge river of crude
oil coursing past the bay.
   The fishermen, increasingly equipped with booms, oil vacuums,
and supply vessels from the state and Exxon, have laid four miles
of boom across the bay since they started a week ago.
   Still, currents pushed oil against the booms Monday, and a light
sheen made its way past outer barriers.
   Al Rule is among the fishermen who move along the booms in
skiffs, keeping them lined up against the oil.
   ``This hatchery is our meat and potatoes,'' said Rule, ``so I
know we got to save it. ...
   ``But I still think about what I'd be doing if there wasn't an
oil spill and I wasn't doing this. I'd be fishin' right now, I'd be
herring fishing if it wasn't shut. That's my spring money, my
start-up money there, and that's what I'd like to be doing.''
   The fierce determination of people like Rule is the reason San
Juan will survive the oil tide, predicted Al Kegler, the state
Department of Environmental Conservation official helping the
efforts.
   ``We'll make the booms hold and we'll beat the oil.''
   The hatchery, nestled alongside rickety gray wooden docks in the
sound's southwest corner, is one of five hatcheries that supply an
average of 50 percent of the millions of pink salmon that surge
each summer through the sound.
   Lamb said only San Juan has a chance now.
   The others, further north in a chain of islands, will suffer due
to their distance from clean ocean waters. Their hundreds of
millions of salmon fry must feed and swim much further through oil,
and have less chance of surviving, he said.
   Even small amounts of the toxic oil can poison the fry.
   ``San Juan is the linchpin of the salmon fishery here,'' Lamb
said.
   Other fisheries, meanwhile, are quietly shutting down for the
year, victims of the spill.
   The last casualty came Monday when the state Department of Fish
and Game closed the region's $12 million to $15 million herring
season. Last week, the sablefish and shrimp fisheries were shut.
Officials have until May 1 to decide on releasing the salmon fry.
The salmon runs begin in late June and early July.
   Frank Gurske of nearby Chenega Bay thinks it will take more than
one hatchery to save the fishery, much less his way of life.
   ``Nobody's going to buy the fish. They'll be scared of the
oil,'' he said.
   Gurske, who lays boom now, is a fisherman married into an Alaska
native family.
   ``We go hunting seals to sell to make our income in the winter.
We catch halibut, bottomfish, salmon that we put up for the winter.
We go out and get our meat, our deer. Now all this is going to stop
because of the oil spill. This thing is going to hurt all life out
there,'' Gurske said.
   Clomping along the dock in heavily oiled boots, he said: ``I
don't know what's going to happen. ... Now we're going to have to
buy the food, and we don't know how we'll do it.
   ``It's a mess.''

   Voters turned out in heavy numbers today to
decide whether Richard M. Daley should inherit his father's
political mantle and end black control of the mayor's office.
   ``Now I got two votes,'' Daley joked after he and his wife
Maggie voted late this morning.
   The first few hours of voting indicated that 70 percent of the
city's 1.56 million registered voters would go to the polls, said
Tom Leach, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Elections.
   ``That's a pretty good vote, third highest in history for a
municipal election,'' he said.
   The Democratic nominee, whose father ruled Chicago for 21 years
until his death in 1976, has enjoyed double-digit leads in the
polls but warned of complacency on the eve of the ballot.
   ``It's a problem when these polls come out and they tell you you
are so far ahead,'' Daley said Monday night. ``I think it's going
to be a close election.''
   The Cook County prosecutor's chief rival, Alderman Timothy
Evans, campaigned with Jesse Jackson and appealed to blacks by
invoking th black people saying they want a black mayor.''
   Elsewhere, voters were choosing mayors in St. Louis, Madison,
Wis., Wichita, Kan., and Omaha, Neb. Voters in Kansas City, Mo.,
were voting on a proposal to give more power to the mayor and limit
the mayor and city council members to three consecutive four-year
terms.
   Residents of suburban Winnetka were voting on a non-binding
resolution to ban handguns. Last May 20, Laurie Dann carried three
handguns into a Winnetka school where she shot and killed an
8-year-old boy and wounded several others. She later committed
suicide.
   In Alabama, Democrat Glen Browder, the secretary of state, was
favored to defeat Republican state Sen. John Rice for the 3rd
District congressional seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Bill
Nichols, a Democrat.

   Macho muscle shirts clash with drippy,
high-water pants at ``Jocks and Nerds,'' a fashion exhibit that
celebrates and spoofs 20th-century men.
   The two stereotypes are among 12 categories being explored
through May 16 in an exhibit at the Fashion Institute of Technology
that shows ``how men create images for themselves,'' said curator
Richard Martin.
   Mannequins are transformed into jocks, nerds, rebels, workers,
cowboys, military men, hunters, sportsmen, Joe College,
businessmen, men about town and dandies.
   A man's clothing reflects his personality, although ``perhaps
not in a purely conscious way,'' Martin said.
   ``Someone can be a businessman five days a week, but on Saturday
he puts on his safari jacket and becomes the Ernest Hemingway of
Great Neck,'' said Martin. ``At night, he goes to a downtown club
and becomes a rebel.''
   Or perhaps a jock _ depicted here in photographs of Sylvester
Stallone as ``Rocky,'' a reclining Jim Palmer pitching Jockey
underwear, and a comic book outlining Charles Atlas' rise from
97-pound-weakling to he-man.
   ``Jocks go in and out of favor. In the late 1960s and early
'70s, the anti-establishment time, jocks were portrayed as dumb,''
said Martin. But they are always perceived as sexy.
   ``Indeed, the classification of men's underwear into jockey and
boxer shorts, both alluding to sports, seems to imply that the
sanction of athletics is required for manly attire,'' notes the
``Jocks and Nerds'' catalog.
   Nerds have other qualities.
   The exhibit, noted Martin, features ``our '80s nerd, complete
with white socks, high-water pants and black glasses: beautifully
made clothing that really respects the history of the nerd: the
pattern mix, the ungainliness, the T-shirt under the open collar of
a 1950s nylon shirt in a really icky material.''
   A nerd, he said, might wear a short-sleeve shirt under a sweater
vest, making ``his arms too cold and his chest too hot. It causes a
real sense of discomfort and the nerd projects that.''
   Nerds surfaced in the 1950s _ and a funny thing happened to them
in recent years. ``The downtown club people suddenly started
buttoning their top button and wearing high-water trousers,'' said
Martin.
   Also featured in the exhibit is a crowd of mannequins offering
blasts from the past: a paisley Nehru suit; cowboy chaps made of
sheepskin and skunk, on loan from the Buffalo Bill museum in Cody,
Wyo.; loud pants patterned with golf tees and balls, once favored
in Palm Beach; and a black velvet suit with bellbottom pants _
donated by Martin, who ``can't believe I wore that.''
   And Martin pointed out a collection of ``great, bizarre ties''
with pictures of hula dancers, Marilyn Monroe, cocker spaniels,
horses. ``There are always some men who are quite conventional but
who will buy the most extraordinary ties,'' he said.
   The clothing was borrowed, gleaned from staffers' attics and
scrounged at flea markets.
   ``We were real crazed flea-market shoppers. We'd get there the
minute the doors opened,'' said Martin, who usually hates to shop
but discovered he would ``go wild and become the worst sort of
grabby shopper'' while building the collection.
   He said it's believed to be the first exhibit of 20th century
men's clothing.
   ``Most museums have collected great women's clothing but have
very little concern for men's clothing,'' said Martin. ``It's very
difficult to find historic men's clothing _ men tend to wear it
until it wears out.''

   President Bush has assigned Vice President Dan
Quayle to head a new White House council on American business
competitiveness, a spokesman said today.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said conditions in the world
demand that ``we maintain and improve our economic
competitiveness.''
   Members of the council will include Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, budget director Richard Darman, White House chief
of staff John Sununu and Michael Boskin, chairman of the
President's Council of Economic Advisers.
   Quayle already is chairman of the National Space Council, an
Eisenhower-era body that Bush has reconstructed to explore and
promote the advancement of the nation's space program.
   As part of its mission to improve U.S. business competitiveness,
the new council will examine, among other things, government
regulation and paperwork burdens, Fitzwater said.
   He said, however, that it would ``not be a decision-making
body'' and that the panel would instead focus on ``the larger
questions that bear on competitiveness.''
   ``They will determine their own duration and the nature of their
work,'' the spokesman said, ``so the vice president will give form
and substance to this group.''

   Gov. Evan Bayh said today that he will
abolish Indiana's special-assignment prison release program, which
has been criticized since a furloughed inmate was accused of
killing his ex-wife.
   Bayh also endorsed a recommendation from a seven-member
Department of Correction panel to establish a bill of rights to
better protect crime victims and witnesses.
   Bayh ordered the panel's study after Alan Matheney was charged
with fatally beating his ex-wife March 4 while on an eight-hour
pass from the Correctional Industrial Complex in Pendleton.
   Matheney was serving an eight-year prison sentence for battering
Lisa Marie Bianco. He now faces murder and burglary charges in her
death and could face the death penalty if convicted on both counts.
   Authorities say neither Bianco nor the St. Joseph County
prosecutor were told that Matheney would be released on a pass,
despite their requests for notification.
   The panel, led by corrections Commissioner James E. Aiken,
recommended the abolishment of the special assignment program,
which allows certain inmates who are not near the end of their
prison terms to work in the community during the day. Those inmates
also have been allowed unescorted leaves of up to 48 hours once a
month.
   The panel also recommended tighter controls on eligibility
requirements for other minimum-security programs and closer
monitoring of offenders' criminal histories.
   ``The priority is to protect the public,'' Aiken said, noting
that the corrections department is looking now at where the inmates
who no longer qualify for prison release programs will be housed
during the next ``180-day crunch period.''
   Almost 400 inmates involved in the three minimum-security
programs will be sent back to the general prison population because
of the ``drastically tightened'' eligibility requirements, Bayh
said.
   The panel also recommended that offenders not be allowed to
leave a work release center, except for employment or educational
purposes, without a leave approved by the director. The panelists
also suggested random telephone calls to ensure that offenders
released into the community shortly before their terms are
completed are following department rules.

<TEXT>
   A law giving one of China's free-enterprise
cities the right to make its own laws ran into unprecedented
opposition in the legislature Tuesday, and after passage a member
demanded a recount from the floor.
   Negative votes or abstentions were recorded on all nine laws or
motions presented on the last day of the annual legislative
session. All were approved by large margins.
   One of the most important measures give people the right to sue
officials, but a Western legal expert said its purpose was to
increase central control, not protect the rights of citizens.
   The law that caused the stir in the National People's Congress
gave special legislative freedom to Shenzhen, a city in Guangdong
province.
   Most of the 2,688 deputies supported the bill, but 274 voted
against it and 805 abstained in the greatest show of opposition
since the legislature was established 40 years ago.
   Fellow deputies cheered when Huang Xunxin, representing Taiwan,
spoke out against the bill from the floor. He said the congress was
usurping powers of Guangdong province and other cities also would
demand autonomy.
   A woman deputy screamed for a recount but her demand was
ignored. A third member strode to the microphone after the vote to
repeat his opposition.
   It was an unusual performance in a legislature that customarily
rubber-stamps Communist Party policies, but was more indicative of
the session's conservative tone than of a new independent spirit.
   China's leaders stressed to the congress that power must be
recentralized, but the new law does the opposite in Shenzhen, one
of the Special Economic Zones where most capital is foreign and
most products are intended for export.
   At last year's congress, by contrast, legislators made bold
statements about the necessity for ambitious economic reform.
   This year, the reform program started in 1978 to introduce
market forces received several setbacks and political reform was
put on hold. Human rights was labeled ``an abstract concept'' and
control of the state-run press was tightened.
   At the start of Tuesday's session, the legislature approved a
report given by Premier Li Peng on opening day, March 20. It
stressed the need for social stability and a return to centralized
economic power.
   Li's report was a reaction to such economic problems as record
annual inflation of 36 percent, widespread corruption and scarcity
of staple goods. He recommended at least two years of austerity and
restoration of government controls over some aspects of the economy.
   Other reports approved by the legislature put new taxes and
restrictions on fledgling private and collective enterprises, the
most active part of the economy.
   Deputies also passed a budget equivalent to $77.2 billion that
devotes more money to education and agriculture and has a deficit
equal to about $2 billion.
   In its resolution approving the premier's report, the congress
called for stronger central management and adherence to such ideals
as socialist morality, collectivism, thrift and hard work.
   Members made 120 changes in Li's report, most of them minor. One
that requires feasibility studies for major policies apparently was
designed to keep powerful ministers from making decisions
recklessly.
   Another change revives a model-worker program, which seems to be
a step back toward the days when portraits of ``Socialist Worker
Heroes'' adorned post office walls.
   The law allowing citizens to sue the government takes effect in
October 1990. It gives people the right to sue officials for
specific acts but not to challenge laws or regulations.
   A Western legal expert who attended the congress said its aim
was to further centralization of power by using the threat of legal
action to restrict the often wide powers of middle-level officials.
   He said it is not designed to protect the rights of citizens
even though it is couched in such language.
   ``If an official follows the state's laws and regulations then
he is immune, but if he ignores those regulations someone might
bring him to court,'' he said. ``That is the message here.''
   As with the opening session, 84-year-old senior leader Deng
Xiaoping was absent. Deng said he excused himself to preserve his
health.

   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez said
today it's time to ``change bullets for ballots'' in Central
America, but that cannot be done without the support of Cuba and
the Soviet Union.
   Following a meeting in the Oval Office with President Bush,
Arias praised the United States for finding a joint
executive-legislative compromise on a program of almost $50 million
in aid for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   ``Now people here can talk with one single voice,'' he told
reporters gathered in the White House driveway following his nearly
hour-long meeting with Bush. ``I think, this time, they are,
indeed, in good faith trying to support the efforts of the five
Central American presidents to reach democracy and peace at the
negotiating table.''
   Arias said that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is
visiting President Fidel Castro in Cuba, must persuade Castro not
to support guerrillas in El Salvador if ``he supports sincerely the
Central American peace plan.''
   ``War has taught us ... that violence is not the solution,'' he
said. ``I think we have learned that we must change bullets for
ballots, and we cannot do this without the support of Cuba and the
Soviet Union.''
   Bush paused amidst a series of meetings with Mideast leaders to
get an update on the Central American situation from Arias, who won
the Nobel Peace prize two years ago for his mediation efforts in
the region.
   Neither Bush nor his guest would answer reporters' questions
during a picture-taking session at the outset of the Oval Office
meeting.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the two ``had a
very friendly and productive discussion.'' Fitzwater said Arias
asked for U.S. assistance in helping to negotiate loans with the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank to pay off Costa Rican
debts, and said Bush agreed to look into that.
   On Central American policy, the spokesman said that ``our
fundamental common ground'' with Costa Rica is the two countries'
interest in democracy in Central America. ``Both presidents agreed
that their goals were ... demobilization of the Contras and
repatriation into their country,'' Fitzwater said.
   He also said reported remarks by Soviet spokesman Gennady
Ge4rasimov about Soviet opposition to ``export of revolution'' were
``very encouraging in terms of Central America.''
   Fitzwater said the comments ``could be very significant if they
mean the reduction of Soviet military support in Nicaragua or if
they mean that Soviet surrogates would cease supporting'' leftist
guerrillas in El Salvador.
   The talks with Arias come more than two weeks after Bush and
bipartisan congressional leaders announced agreement on the new
humanitarian aid plan.
   Taking reporters' questions at the conclusion of his White House
meeting, Arias said it was crucial that the repatriation of the
counter-revolutionaries occur simultaneously with the institution
of democratic reforms by the Sandinista government headed by
President Daniel Ortega.
   Otherwise, he said, ``you cannot persuade the Contras to go back
to Nicaragua ... if you have nothing for them there. You need a big
carrot.''
   Arias noted that there long had been arguments about whether the
Contras should lay down their arms following democratization moves
by the Sandinistas, or whether they should be dismantled as a
fighting force before such steps are undertaken.
   ``I think this should be simultaneous,'' he said. ``With
repatriation there should be a democratic climate in Nicaragua or
there is no reason for them to go back.''
   Arias, however, said he told Bush he was concerned about how
free elections could be achieved in Nicaragua, noting there had
been no such elections there in some 50 years.
   ``I am really worried as a Costa Rican about the organization of
the next elections,'' he said.
   Bush acknowledged last Friday that there was ``not a snowball's
chance in hell of getting a dime'' of military aid for the
counter-revolutionaries.
   The Bush administration is demanding, as the Reagan
administration did for eight years, that the Sandinistas make good
on promises of democratization they made to the Organization of
American States in 1979, at the time they overthrew the
dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza.
   In the meantime, Arias is pushing a new plan aimed at
dismantling the Contras in exchange for free and open elections in
Nicaragua by February 1990.
   Arias scheduled the Washington visit while passing through en
route to an official visit to Canada, said White house press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush said last Friday that by getting humanitarian aid ``that
goes with this (February 1990) election, I am hopeful that the
Nicaraguans will go forward and do that which they give rhetorical
support for _ but that which they've failed to implement and that
means democracy _ free, certifiable elections.''

   The 6-year-old son of U.S. Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
was in serious but stable condition Tuesday after being hit by a
car as the two left Memorial Stadium following the Baltimore
Orioles' season opener.
   Albert Gore III suffered a broken rib, thigh fractures, a
ruptured spleen, bruised lung and a concussion, said Elaine
Freeman, a spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins Hospital.
   According to police, witnesses said the child let go of his
father's hand and was hit by a car when he ran out into the street
near the stadium.
   The driver of the car, Jasper McWilliams, 22, of suburban Middle
River, was not speeding and no charges were filed, police said.
   Gore, D-Tenn., spent the night at the hospital Monday and
remained there Tuesday.
   Gore and his wife, Tipper, who also have three daughters, live
in Arlington, Va.
   The baseball season-opener, in which the Orioles beat the Boston
Red Sox 5-4 in 11 innings, began with President George Bush
throwing the first ball.

   The NATO alliance, shaped out of the
fears of Soviet expansionism, turned 40 on Tuesday with Western
officials expressing caution and uncertainty about the dramatic
changes gripping the Soviet Union.
   Manfred Woerner, secretary-general of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, said the Soviet Union will still
remain a strong military power even if promised cuts are carried
out in troops and military spending.
   ``The intentions of the current Soviet leadership ... are
peaceful ones,'' Woerner told a news conference at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he
said, ``doesn't want to wage a war.''
   But he cautioned, ``There is still a risk because intentions may
change. We have no control over them. Personalities, leaders may
change.''
   Woerner's remarks capped a morning of ceremonies marking the
signing of the NATO treaty on April 4, 1949, forming a security
alliance that links the United States and Canada with Western
European nations. The Western nations joined the pact to unite
against the threat of expansionism posed by Moscow in the years
following World War II.
   Gorbachev's recent agenda of economic and social reforms and his
promises of military cuts have diminished the public's perception
of that threat and raised questions about NATO's role.
   Anniversary speeches, celebrations and a few protests held
elsewhere in Europe reflected the new situation.
   British Defense Secretary George Younger, in a speech at NATO
offices north of London, credited the alliance with helping bring
about ``the long overdue changes'' under way in Eastern Europe.
   Five members of the Christian Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament
demonstrated outside the NATO complex, undeterred by a rare spring
sprinkling of snow. NATO officials served them hot tea.
   In Oslo, Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland called
NATO ``the most successful alliance we know'' and Foreign Minister
Thorvald Stoltenberg called it ``more important than ever.''
   A small group of protesters in Rome, including Greens Party
deputy Gianni Mattioli, organized a conference called ``40 Years Is
Enough.'' They demonstrated outside the premier's office and
particuarly objected to the scheduled relocation of a squadron of
U.S. F-16 fighters from Spain to Italy.
   A naval exercise and marching bands marked the anniversary in
Copenhagen, while a few hundred peace activists staged a
demonstration. No incidents were reported.
   Woerner, former German defense minister, led off the outdoor
celebrations at NATO headquarters on an unseasonably cold day in
Brussels.
   Military bands from Belgium, Denmark, Britain, Luxembourg and
the Netherlands marched and played music before an audience of
diplomats and military officials. The flags of the 16 member
nations were unfurled against the gray sky.
   Woerner reminded the audience that the alliance was formed out
of the post-war hostilities.
   ``Forty years ago,'' he said, ``Europe lay in ruins; the most
terrible war ever conducted had left its bloody traces of
destruction. ... Communist expansionism threatened to subjugate the
whole of Europe.''
   The allies, he said, ``have once again reached a crucial and
decisive historical junction'' as they did when they signed the
treaty.
   ``The old post-war European order is on its way out,'' he said.
``The future is an open book full of challenges, opportunities and
risks.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party
recommended on Monday that NATO be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
   In a statement, Kohl said NATO had secured ``the longest period
of European peace since the Middle Ages. We must be thankful for
that.''
   The United States, Canada and 10 European nations _ Belgium,
Britain, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway and Portugal _ were the original NATO members.
   Greece, Turkey, West Germany and Spain later joined the Alliance.

   U.S. security personnel around the world have
been notified to be on the alert for anti-American terrorism timed
to the April 15 anniversary of the U.S. bombing of Libya.
   However, the State Department is not aware of any specific
threats, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Tuesday while
announcing the precautionary move.
   On April 15, 1986, U.S. warplanes bombed Tripoli in what was
described by the Reagan administration as a reprisal for Libya's
involvement in terrorist actions against Americans.
   Ms. Tutwiler said ``we always are more vigilant'' during the
anniversary period, and that ``security personnel are notified to
take appropriate precautions.''

   Namibian policemen battling
black nationalist guerrillas are combat-hardened fighters more
accustomed to bush warfare than routine law enforcement.
   The black patrolmen and their mainly white South African
officers wear military uniforms and move about in heavily armored
personnel carriers equipped with machine guns.
   They have played a leading role in fighting guerrillas of the
South-West Africa People's Organization since a special police
counterinsurgency unit was formed in 1979, 13 years after the black
nationalist fighters began the war for independence from South
Africa.
   Known as ``Koevoet'' _ the Afrikaans word for crowbar _ the unit
officially was disbanded in January as a goodwill gesture after
South Africa agreed to end its rule of Namibia.
   However, most of Koevoet's estimated 3,000 men were integrated
into the regular police and were ready for combat when heavy
fighting erupted Saturday as a cease-fire was suppposed to take
effect.
   Guerrilla leaders accuse police of initiating the fighting by
hunting down guerrilla units which had no intention of staging
attacks.
   Under the U.S.-sponsored United Nations plan for Namibia's
independence, guerrilla and South African troops as well as those
of the South-West African Territorial Force were to be confined to
their bases from Saturday. The territorial police force of 8,300
men was entitled to operate freely, with full responsibility for
maintaining law and order during the transition to independence.
   More than 90 percent of Namibia's policemen and soldiers of its
territorial force are blacks. They are led by white officers,
mainly South African. Most South African army troops in Namibia are
white.
   Koevoet's history is clouded with controversy. Its effectiveness
is widely acknowleged, but many Namibians attribute its success to
ruthlessness. Several dozen of its members have been accused of
atrocities against civilians, although only a few have been
convicted.
   Koevoet claims to have killed 2,812 guerrillas between 1979 and
1988 for the loss 132 black and 19 white members.
   Leaders of the guerrilla's legal political wing in Namibia
describe Koevoet members as ``programmed killers'' who will be
required to undergo ``reorientation'' if the guerrillas win
independence elections.
   Defenders of Koevoet say the criticism is tacit acknowledgement
of the unit's prowess.
   ``Counterinsurgency work is not very easy, and sometimes things
get a little tense,'' Koevet commander Gen. Hans Dreyer said last
month. ``But without the support of the local people, we would not
have had any success.''
   In a standard Koevoet operation, four armored personnel carriers
with 10 blacks and a white commander each would head into the bush
for a week at a time, questioning villagers and looking for traces
of guerrillas.
   Koevoet trackers sometimes would follow a trail for days, even
crossing into Angola, where most of the guerrillas are based. Most
Namibian policemen are recruited in the north of the country among
the Ovambo people who are famed for their tracking and other bush
skills.
   The guerrillas almost always were on foot, and often were
mismatched when overtaken by the personnel carriers or by
helicopter gunships which Koevoet would call in.

<HEAD>Deficit Shouldn't Stand in Way of Handicapped Education: NEA President</HEAD>

   The federal deficit should not be an obstacle
to serving all handicapped and disadvantaged students eligible for
help under federal programs, the president of the nation's largest
teachers union said Tuesday.
   ``I do not believe that the children of America created the
deficit,'' said Mary Futrell, president of the 1.9 million-member
National Education Association.
   The organization is calling for an extra $10 billion in federal
education spending to counter ``a shocking erosion'' in services
under four major programs for disadvantaged students, low-income
college students, handicapped students and students with limited
proficiency in English.
   In a report called ``Federal Education Funding: Present
Realities and Future Needs,'' the group says many federal programs
reach only a fraction of those they are meant to serve. Serving all
students currently eligible for the four programs would cost more
than $10 billion, it says.
   ``I'm not an expert so I can't say where we would get the
money,'' Futrell said at a news conference. But she said the union
has offered to sit down with Bush administration officials and
members of Congress to look at the overall budget and re-arrange
priorities.
   ``We are aware of the fact that we can't do this in one year,''
Futrell said. ``It might take five years or 10 years. But what's
important is that we recognize the problem ... and make the
commitment to fully fund these programs in 1993 or 1998.''
   The report looks specifically at Chapter 1, grants to bolster
basic skills among disadvantaged younsters; the Education for All
Handicapped Act, which helps states educate disabled youngsters;
bilingual education, grants to make sure students with native
languages other than English succeed in school; and Pell grants for
college students from low-income families.
   The NEA reported the following statistics:
   _Chapter 1. The number of students served declined from 7
million in 1980-81 to 5.7 million in 1988-89. The program reached
65 percent of eligible students in 1980-81 but only 40 percent by
1986.
   Congress provided $4.6 billion for Chapter 1 in fiscal 1989,
enough to serve 47 percent of eligible students. To serve the
estimated 8.5 million who will qualify next year would cost about
$6.9 billion, a $2.3 billion increase over current levels.
   _Handicapped. The federal share of costs to local school
districts started at 12 percent 15 years ago and was intended to
rise gradually to 40 percent. Instead it stayed at 12 percent until
1980 and has fallen to 7 percent today. To reach the 40 percent
target would cost $8.4 billion, a $6.5 billion hike over current
levels.
   _Bilingual education. Such programs serve one in 18 of students
who need help in English skills. An increase of more than $1
billion would be needed to serve all 1.6 million students states
say are eligible.
   _Pell grants. Such funds have increased slightly when adjusted
for inflation, but the increases have not come near matching the
soaring costs of postsecondary education. In addition, Congress has
``fallen far short'' of meeting its own authorized maximum fore
individual grants. Some $600 million would be needed to fully fund
the maximum $2,900 Pell grant permitted in fiscal 1990.
   The NEA report was based on charts provided by Federal Planning
Services Inc. of Washington, D.C., an independent statistical
analysis firm, and statistics from government agencies including
the Education Department and the Census Bureau.

<HEAD>Navy Delays Trident 2 Test After Failure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has postponed its April test shot of
the Trident 2 missile to give investigators more time to find the
cause of last month's failure, the Pentagon's chief spokesman said
Tuesday.
   The spokesman, Dan Howard, declined to provide a tentative date
for the rescheduled test beyond saying it would probably be in
early May.
   He said the delay did not necessarily mean the entire test
program for the Navy's newest and most potent weapon had suffered a
serious setback.
   ``We're talking about a mechanical problem of some sort, and the
broad evaluation by experts is that mechanical problems are easier
to solve than some other types of problems,'' Howard said.
   ``The analysis to date of the telemetry data indicates that the
missile control was lost due to a mechanical failure in the after
end of the first-stage motor. Until the investigation is completed
and the extent of the corrective action is determined, we simply
cannot assess the impact on the overall program.''
   Howard further disclosed on Tuesday that the Navy had discovered
a large ``debris field'' from the failed test _ on the bottom of
the Atlantic Ocean at a depth of about 2,500 feet. Parts of the
first-stage rocket motor have been sighted, he added.
   The Navy's investigation began March 21, shortly after a Trident
2 missile fired from the submarine Tennessee blew up just four
seconds after launch. The missile popped to the surface as planned
and the first stage ignited properly, but then the missile began
spinning like a burning pinwheel and exploded.
   It was the first submarine launch of the new long-range nuclear
missile.
   According to Howard, the first-stage rocket nozzles of the
missile are supposed to swivel immediately after firing to put the
weapon on a 19-degree angle of flight. Then another internal
command is sent to the nozzles to straighten back up.
   Two motors are located in the missile's aft end to move the
nozzles back and forth. In this case, the spokesman said, the
nozzles never straightened after the second command.
   The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon
that is the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent, the Trident
1. The new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to
individual targets up to 6,000 miles away.
   The Navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its
undersea predecessors _ Polaris, Poseidon and Trident 1 _ and can
match the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it
is launched from a submerged, moving submarine.

<HEAD>Soviet Writers Form PEN chapter, Defend Rushdie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's leading writers have formed a
chapter of the international writers organization PEN and in their
first action defended author Salman Rushdie, a newspaper said.
   The authors wrote that they condemned both insults to religious
and ethnic feelings as well as demands for retribution, the
literary weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta wrote in its latest edition.
   ``This is why we appeal for the revocation of the order for the
murder of the English writer S. Rushdie, who has apologized for the
insult to the Moslem religion,'' the appeal said.
   Iranian revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has
called for the death of Rushdie for what he considers insults to
Islam contained in Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' Iranian
clerics have offered a bounty of $5.2 million for the death of
Rushdie.
   Members of the Soviet PEN organization include poets Yevgeny
Yevtushenko and Andrei Voznesensky, novelists Anatoly Rybakov and
Chengiz Aitmatov, historian Dmitri Likhachev, playwright Mikhail
Shatrov and others.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta said the Soviet PEN chapter would be open
to professional writers who are well known within the Soviet Union
as well as outside it.
   Several leading Soviet writers, including Yevtushenko, were
observers at the PEN conference held in South Korea last fall, and
decided to form a Soviet chapter when they returned home, the paper
said.
   It said PEN was founded on the principle of ``strengthening the
cooperation between writers of all countries, independent of their
political views, in the interests of literature, free speech and
good will in relations between peoples.''
   Soviet writers are feeling more freedom under President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost'' or greater openness, which
has led to the publication of many works that previously had been
banned.

   The engine shutdown occurred Monday night on Flight 134 to Paris

the shutdown never posed a great risk, and ``there was no fire in
the engine.''
   The 412 passengers aboard the Boeing 747 were put on another

   ``Once the passengers came back, we gave them some meal vouchers
and we took care of them the best we could,'' Ms. Timper said.
``Naturally there might have been some unfavorable passenger
reaction, but the shutdown was routine, there was never any danger
in flight and the plane landed without incident.''
   She said most passengers took the inconvenience well.

   The massive Alaskan oil spill could put the
brakes on petroleum exploration there and in other areas _ at least
temporarily _ Environmental Protection Administrator William Reilly
said today.
   ``We will take apart the environmental planning for every aspect
of oil development in Alaska and in other sensitive areas where the
environment potentially could be threatened.,'' Reilly told a House
appropriations subcommittee.
   Asked by Rep. Bob Traxler, D-Mich., if the disaster in Prince
William Sound would prompt a re-evaluation of the environmental
threat posed by oil development policy, Reilly added:
   ``We are doing that, as you know, off the coast of California
and the coast of Florida - looking at three proposed lease sales
there for oil and gas that appear to have significant environmental
concerns associated with them.
   We'll do it in Prince William Sound and look very carefully at
future contingency planning there. And we'll do it on the North
Sslope. I think we owe that to the environment. We owe that to
common sense.''
   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., asked Reilly if he meant that the
administration would not move forward on a controversial proposal
for oil exploration in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge until a
review had been completed.
   ``There is a very clear understanding that we will not move
forward if we have any significant concerns that have not been
resolved, yes sir,'' he responded.
   Reilly's comments came just a day after Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan Jr., said the oil spill off Alaska could become the
petroleum industry's Three Mile Island if steps aren't taken to
assure the public that oil developers are capable of protecting the
environment.
   Lujan's remarks to an oil and gas industry conference Monday
suggested the massive spill last month into Prince William Sound
off Alaska by the tanker Exxon Valdez could have long lasting
effects on the petroleum industry if some public damage control is
not undertaken.
   ``It takes a long, long time to recover from these things,''
said Lujan, comparing the Exxon Valdez spill to the accident a
decade ago at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.
The nuclear industry has yet to recover from that accident.
   ``If the image of an uncareful and uncaring industry prevails
among the U.S. public, then we can kiss goodbye the domestic oil
and gas development in (the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge),
offshore and in the public lands,'' Lujan told a conference of the
National Ocean Industries Association.
   The group represents about 235 companies involved in offshore
oil exploration and drilling.
   Lujan, nevertheless, emphasized that the Bush administration
continues to support ``environmentally sound'' oil development in
the arctic refuge and declared, ``Unless we pursue a coordinated
policy to develop this country's domestic energy sources, including
offshore oil and gas, every American will pay dearly for our
failure.''
   President Bush generally has supported offshore drilling, but in
one of his first steps as president ordered a review into the
proposed sale of oil leases involving two areas off the California
coast and one off the Everglades in Florida because of
environmental concerns.
   On the spill from the Exxon Valdez, the worst oil tanker spill
in U.S. history, Lujan said inadequate recovery equipment likely
prevented any chances of an effective cleanup within hours after
accident. The vessel ran aground during the early hours of March 24
outside the port of Valdez, Alaska.
   ``If it happened (again) someplace now you'd have the same
disastrous situation,'' the interior secretary told reporters after
his speech to the petroleum industry group.
   Lujan said a key lesson learned from the accident is that
cleanup equipment and preparedness for such a disaster must be
improved.
   ``We need to be a little bit more prepared,'' said Lujan. ``...
I understand about 80 percent of the oil was lost in the first hour
or two. I don't know that we could ever have contained it. Maybe it
got away too quick.''
   Later he told reporters, ``The kind of equipment that we have
(available) ... isn't enough to take care of a spill like this.''
He said it was found that floating containment booms broke and oil
skimmers were of little help.
   The characterization that the cleanup effort was doomed within
hours of the accident has been disputed by some Alaska fishermen,
who have complained that opportunities were missed when little was
done while relatively calm weather prevailed for two days after the
accident.
   Oil company officials have acknowledged they did not begin to
deploy cleanup booms around the hemorrhaging tanker until at least
10 hours after the accident.
   Exxon officials have blamed some of the delay on the government
for not providing an early go-ahead to use chemicals to disperse
the oil, while fishermen and state officials have accused the oil
company of misleading them as to their cleanup capabilities.

   Cuba accused the United States on Tuesday of
preparing new plans to increase military and economic pressure as a
means of undermining its revolution.
   A top Communist Party official, Julian Rizo Alvarez, said the
United States once again is suffering from illusions about Cuba.
   ``As always, they are confused and they make mistakes,'' he
said. ``Today we are a harder a more difficult bone to swallow than
ever before,'' he said.
   Rizo spoke to a ceremony honoring a contingent of Cuban soldiers
returning from Angola.
   He alluded to a memo made public last week in which Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said the United States has no plans to
improve relations with Cuba because of this country's continued
``unacceptable behavior.''
   Baker's memo, Rizo said, augers ``new machinations, new
campaigns and plans to continue pressurng us militarily and
economically and to reinforce its attacks in the political
terrain.''
   He added that it seems the United States has not had enough as
yet of the ``defeats suffered in their efforts to crush us, to
erase us from the face of the earth.''
   Baker's confidential memo, first disclosed last week by The
Associated Press, said Cuba contynues to provide the Soviet Union
with major political, strategic and intelligence benefits and to
support subversive movements in the hemisphere.
   Baker said he wanted to set the record straight because there
have been reports of a ``warming trend'' between the two countries
following Cuba's agreement in December to withdraw its troops from
Angola.

<TEXT>
   Rockets hit residential neighborhoods
of Kabul on Tuesday, killing at least five people, Afghan and
foreign sources reported.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said up to 25
people may have died. His report could not be confirmed.
   At least six rockets were said to have landed in or near the
Khair Khanna and Wazirabad sections close to the airport, which has
been a frequent target of Moslem guerrillas fighting the
Soviet-sponsored government.
   It was the biggest rocket attack on Kabul since five struck the
airport March 14, wounding two people but causing no serious damage.
   Last summer and fall, before Soviet military forces left, 20 or
more rockets often hit Kabul every day. The Red Army completed its
withdrawal Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   Foreign sources said privately at least eight people were
hospitalized Tuesday and another source reported 20 injuries. State
TV showed a burning bus it said was hit by a rocket.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said guerrilla
attacks on Jalalabad, 75 miles east of the capital, had weakened in
the previous 24 hours.
   Reminded that the government had accused the U.S.-backed
insurgents and Pakistani forces of massing men and arms for a new
assault, Amani added: ``It may be the calm before the storm.''
   He said two Pakistanis captured 3{ weeks ago and accused of
spying would go on trial Wednesday in Kabul.
   The Afghan government often accuses Pakistan of military
involvement in the civil war, but Pakistan has denied it.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and the most active groups operate from Pakistan, on
Afghanistan's eastern border. Soviet soldiers entered the war in
December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 were in the country when the
withdrawal began May 15, 1988.
   Amani said Jalaladad was ``relatively calm'' in the 24-hour
period ending at sundown Tuesday. He described shelling of the city
as ``sporadic and limited.''
   Guerrillas besieged Jalalabad on March 6 in their first major
offensive since the Soviets left the Afghan army to carry on the
fight alone.
   Government artillery and air attacks killed 85 of the enemy and
wounded 48 in the past 24 hours, Amani said. He gave casualties on
the government side as two civilians and one soldier killed and two
soldiers wounded.
   Casualty figures cannot be verified. Government and guerrilla
reports customarily exaggerate the other's losses and foreign
reporters are not allowed into the Jalalabad area.
   Most of the recent guerrilla rocket fire at Jalalabad has come
from Kama, about 12 miles east of the city, and from Surkhrod, six
miles to the west, Amani told reporters.
   He said government forces ``opened firs and the enemy was forced
to retreat.'' Amani said most of the insurgents were 15 to 30 miles
from the city.
   Several Scud-B missiles supplied by the Soviet Union were heard
being launched Tuesday from Kabul toward Jalalabad, which is on the
main road to the Pakistani border and near the Afghan end of the
Khyber Pass.
   Amani said the highway to Jalalabad was open and an army convoy
carrying food reached the city Monday.
   The Pakistanis to be tried were captured near Kandahar in
southern Afghanistan in mid-March and shown to foreign reporters in
Kaul a few days later. They identified themselves as Mohammed Afzal
and Mohammed Ashraf and said they were spying.
   Afghan law provides prison terms of 10 to 20 years for
conviction on espionage charges, Amani said.

<HEAD>Air Force Finds Lubricant Problems in Many B-1B Bombers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has discovered a problem with
lubricant levels in a wing gear box on its B-1B bomber fleet that
is slowing the return of the bombers to the air, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said the Strategic
Air Command had cleared the B-1B bomber fleet to return to flight
status on Sunday as individual planes underwent a final safety
check, and more than 35 of the planes would be flying Tuesday.
   During the course of the final safety checks, however, Air Force
mechanics began discovering a problem with gear boxes that are part
of the assembly to move the wings back and forth, the spokesman
continued.
   Howard said the Air Force now expects roughly 90 of the B-1B's
to be certified for flight operations by the weekend.
   The problem involves a loss of the lubricant contained inside a
sealed gear box that handles what is known as the angle gear drive
shaft, Howard said. That angle gear drive shaft is a key component
of the wing-moving assembly.
   According to the Air Force, of 80 B-1B's receiving the final
safety inspection so far, 70 showed insufficient lubricant levels
inside that gear box.
   Howard denied Tuesday the Air Force had uncovered any evidence
showing that a loss of lubricant in that gear box was the cause of
a March 27 incident that led to a week-long grounding of the B-1B
fleet.
   In that incident, a B-1B undergoing a pre-flight check at Dyess
Air Force Base, Texas, suffered a tear in a fuel tank when the left
wing swung too far forward.
   Howard disclosed Tuesday that accident investigators probing the
mishap had discovered a fractured ``quill shaft'' in a main wing
gear box and a fractured ``angle gear drive shaft.''
   Other sources, who insisted on anonymity, said the Air Force
``does now suspect that a lubricant seal problem led to the March
27 mishap,'' probably by allowing too much torque pressure to build
up on the shaft.
   ``At first blush, that's exactly what we believe caused the wing
to go too far,'' said one source. ``There's a very definite
connection.''
   Howard, referring to the two fractured shafts, said ``we don't
know what sequence those occurred in.''
   ``We don't know what the first cause was yet _ whether it was a
procedural problem, a maintenance problem or a hardware problem.
But simply in the course of investigating every possible problem
that they could have had, they did discover this potential problem
(with the lubricant).''
   The Air Force said the sealed gear boxes were manufactured by
the Sundstrand Corp. and when mechanics were finding one with
insufficient lubricant, it was being replaced and sent off to the
contractor for repair.
   ``I think it's fortunate we had the incident at Dyess on the
ground, because that led to the kind of detailed investigation that
enabled us to catch something that we might not have caught,''
added one Air Force source.
   The four-engine B-1B is the first addition to the manned bomber
force in more than 25 years. To improve its performance, the plane
features wings that can be swept forward or backward in flight. The
wings are normally swept back for high-speed attack runs and
forward for takeoffs and landings.
   Built by the Rockwell International Corp., the B-1B has a
maximum speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of more than 7,000
miles.
   The Air Force built 100 of the planes during the Reagan
administration to modernize the old B-52 bomber force while it
developed the new B-2 stealth bomber. Three B-1B's have been lost
in accidents, leaving 97 in the fleet.

   James Bond star Timothy Dalton and actress Vanessa
Redgrave won undisclosed libel damages Tuesday for newspaper
allegations that he was rude to his producer and that colleagues
dreaded her arrival on a movie set.
   Their lawyer, Oscar Beuselinck, told High Court Judge Michael
Davies the settlement had been reached with Mirror Group Newspapers
Ltd.
   The Sunday Mirror alleged in October that Dalton was rude and
behaved unprofessionally toward producer Cubby Brocolli during
filming of ``License to Kill.''
   Beuselinck told the court the newspaper also claimed Redgrave
``was in the habit of making life impossible whenever she appeared
on a film set'' and that people making the movie ``were at one
stage dreading her arrival on the set of the film.''
   Julie Scott-Bayfield, the newspaper's lawyer, said the Sunday
Mirror withdrew the ``wholly untrue'' allegations and apologized
unreservedly.
   Neither Dalton nor Redgrave were in court but Beuselinck said
after the hearing: ``Miss Redgrave is delighted that this matter
has been resolved and Mr. Dalton will almost certainly give his
money to charity.''

   ABC Correspondent Sam Donaldson knows his
new prime-time news program will compete with popular entertainment
shows.
   But the former White House reporter predicts if his show is
successful, evening audiences may get more TV journalism.
   ``Prime time will be taken over more and more by news
departments of the networks,'' Donaldson said in a speech Monday at
the University of Central Arkansas.
   Donaldson told about 350 people that, ``although Diane and I
will be competing on Thursday night against `L.A. Law' and `Knots
Landing,' which are pure entertainment shows, we will still be
straight news.'' Diane Sawyer is anchorwoman.
   The new ABC program will be different from ``60 Minutes'' on CBS
and ``20-20,'' on ABC, because ``mine will not be a magazine show,
although they are good,'' Donaldson said.
   ``We are going to do a topical newscast at 10 p.m. at night,''
he said. ``Our show will be entertaining, but informative.''

   The Cleveland Indians did not disappoint
screenwriter David S. Ward, in town for Tuesday night's debut of
``Major League,'' his latest film which stars Tom Berenger and
Charlie Sheen.
   Ward, whose movie credits include ``The Sting'' in 1973, threw
the ceremonial first pitch for the Indians' opener Monday, in which
they beat Milwaukee, 2-1.
   ``I've been a long-suffering Cleveland Indians fan since I was 5
years old,'' Ward said before he took on his pitching duties.
   ``Major League'' is about misfit minor-leaguers and
over-the-hill baseball veterans signed up as Indians by a new
owner. The owner hopes they'll be so bad that attendance will drop
so she can break her stadium contract and move the team to Miami.
   ``I chose the Indians because of my longstanding interest in
them and because I wanted to do an underdog story,'' Ward said.
``It would be hard to think of a team with more underdog status the
past 30 years than the Cleveland Indians.''

   Gina Lollobrigida, Nino Manfredi, Raf Vallone and
other Italian screen stars have launched a campaign to reduce the
growing number of foreign actors used in Italian films.
   ``We have to defend ourselves, they do it in other countries,
why not here?'' Lollobrigida, a sex symbol of the 1950s and 1960s,
said Monday night at a meeting of the Union of Italian Actors.
   Italian directors often dub actors voices after the film is
shot, making it easy to use foreign actors.
   ``The difference between a foreign actor who comes to Italy and
the Italian actor who goes abroad is that the Italian must speak
the language of that country,'' said Vallone.

   The former Wyoming congressman will be at Wheatland High School
on May 20, and at Upton High School the next day, said Pete
Williams, Cheney's spokesman.
   Cheney's speeches probably will be ``inspirational'' and not
touch on defense issues or politics, Williams said.
   Upton High School Principal Mark Mitchell said the 26-member
senior class invited Cheney before his appointment early last month
as defense secretary. Mitchell said the students were worried he
now wouldn't have time for them.
   Last week, however, Cheney's office contacted the high school to

   Prosecutors demanded the death
sentence Tuesday for a professed North Korean spy who told the
court she wants to die to atone for killing 115 people in the 1987
bombing of a South Korean airliner.
   Prosecutor Lee Sang-hyung also blamed North Korean President Kim
Il Sung and ``the dictatorship in North Korea for the grave crime
of killing the passengers.'' It was ``an unpardonable crime to
mankind,'' he said.
   Lawyer Ahn Dong-il argued his client, Kim Hyon-hui, was ``forced
to commit the act and it is someone else who needs to be punished _
North Korea.''
   Ms. Kim, 27, was a ``scapegoat of the world's most isolated
communist dictatorship,'' Ahn said to yells of abuse from relatives
of victims.
   ``Why do you keep her alive?'' some screamed. ``Kill her!''
   Scores of other relatives were kept out of the courthouse by
hundreds of police and security agents who ringed the building.
   In her final testimony, Ms. Kim told the court: ``I am really
sorry for relatives of the victims. I feel like dying to atone for
what I did.''
   She, too, blamed the Korean leader and his son and heir, whom
she says ordered her to bomb the plane. ``I now curse Kim Il Sung
and Kim Jong Il endlessly,'' she said, sobbing into a handkerchief.
   The verdict and sentence will be issued April 25.
   Lee said Ms. Kim might deserve sympathy because she was a
``puppet'' of North Korea and had repented.
   ``But as a signatory to the Montreal Convention that governs the
safety of civil aviation, the Republic of Korea is obliged to
severely punish the defendant without fail, irrespective of
ideology,'' he said.
   Ahn said Ms. Kim should be kept alive to counter Pyongyang's
charges that she is a South Korean agent and that the bombing was a
frame-up by Seoul authorities.
   Government officials have indicated Ms. Kim may get a
presidential pardon because they say she was duped by North Korea
and has repented.
   She said on South Korean TV in January 1988 that she planted the
bomb as part of a North Korean plot to disrupt the summer Olympics
in Seoul. North Korea denies involvement.
   Police explosives expert Lt. Kim Moon-Ho testified Tuesday that
the mixture of explosives used in the bomb was so powerful it would
have destroyed the aircraft in less than a second.
   ``There would be no time, no chance, to contact anybody,'' he
said. Details of the bomb come from Ms. Kim since little plane
wreckage was found.
   The Korean Air Boeing 707 disappeared Nov. 29, 1987, on a flight
from Baghdad to Seoul over the Andaman Sea as it approached the
Burmese coast.
   Ms. Kim said she and another intelligence agent pretending to be
Japanese tourists planted the bomb when they flew from Baghdad to
Abu Dhabi.
   The pair were arrested in Bahrain shortly afterward and
attempted to take cyanide hidden in cigarettes. The other agent, an
elderly man, died. But Ms. Kim recovered and was extradited to
Seoul.
   In South Korea, defendants must stand trial even if they confess.

   Liquor was once as much a staple of a mariner's
rations as bread, and sights of drunken sailors in port were
tolerated as compensation for hard, lonely duty at sea.
   But authorities said booze on board was banned by most U.S.
commercial shippers well before the Alaskan oil spill that happened
after the tipsy skipper allowed an uncertified third mate to
operate the tanker.
   ``The whole philosophy about drinking has changed. It's just not
tolerated anymore,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Epler of the Coast
Guard's crisis action center.
   ``Any hand who's drunk aboard a vessel makes it unseaworthy,''
said Carmine Guastella, who set up an alcohol rehabilitation
program in 1977 for the National Maritime Union. ``This is a black
eye to the American merchant marine.''
   Federal regulations that took effect in January 1988 prohibit
commercial operators from having 0.04 percent alcohol in their
blood. Drinking is also prohibited four hours before going on duty.
   Authorities said Capt. Joseph Hazelwood had a 0.061 percent
level nine hours after the Exxon Valdez lurched onto Bligh Reef in
Prince William Sound, gushing 10.1 million gallons of crude oil
March 24 in the worst oil spill in U.S. history.
   Hazelwood, 42, was fired by the Exxon Corp., which bans alcohol
on its ships, even to crewmen who are off duty. The captain was
twice arrested on drunken driving charges and his drivers' license
was suspended three times.
   Captains are required on their shipping license applications to
report arrests for driving while intoxicated.
   Hazelwood was checked under new federal regulations that call
for tests after a major accident. Federal officials had trouble
finding a test kit, but a Coast Guard corpsman used one supplied by
Exxon.
   When asked by investigators what was the problem, Hazelwood
said, ``I think you're looking at it,'' according to a court
affidavit. One crewman also said ``his balance was not good,''
according to court documents.
   The new rules about drinking followed 20,604 commercial marine
accidents involving drug and alcohol abuse between 1981 and 1986.
Of the 1,114 deaths and 960 injuries from all causes during that
time, 17 deaths and three injuries involved drug or alcohol use,
the Coast Guard said.
   Hazelwood's case is the most serious since the rules went into
effect.
   On Sunday, the crew of the Century Hope called the Coast Guard
off Long Beach, Calif., because it feared its captain was drunk.
Allen Jones, 58, of Ealing, England, voluntarily submitted to a
blood-alcohol test and is being investigated for being drunk at the
helm.
   ``We haven't found a lot of instances where commercial operators
have been intoxicated. It's come up a handful of times,'' said
Cmdr. Dave Wallace of the Coast Guard's casualty review branch.
``It's not widespread.''
   Drinking on the high seas were once intertwined. Old refrains
told about ``what do you do with a drunken sailor?'' and ``yo ho ho
and a bottle of rum.''
   In a tradition rooted in the rum-powered British navy, U.S.
sailors were given a daily ration of spirits called a grog with
their bread, salt pork and peas.
   The practice was banned in 1862 when sailors were compensated
for their loss, but a lament said, ``They've raised his pay three
cents a day but stopped his grog forever.''
   All booze was banned in 1914, when the blue-nosed teetotaler
Josephus Daniels as Secretary of the Navy ended the custom of
officers having wine in their quarters. He earned the bitter
nickname ``Grape Juice Josephus.''
   Aircraft carriers still have brandy hoarded by doctors for
medicinal purposes, and ships can still be christened with a bottle
of champagne. But a Navy in which thirsty hands once swallowed
alcohol-based torpedo juice during World War II is officially dry.
   Federal regulations for drinking on pleasure boats are more
relaxed.
   Pilots are allowed to have less than 0.1 percent alcohol in
their blood, although booze was the direct result of 158 deaths and
135 injuries in 279 crashes in 1985, the Coast Guard said. Half of
all pleasure boating accidents are thought to be related to
drinking, the Coast Guard estimated.
   ``It's much more stringent for operators of commericial
vessels,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Paul Milligan of the Coast Guard's public
affairs office in New York.
   ``A tanker that has the potential of creating a major oil slick
is more serious than going around a harbor erratically. It can
affect an ecology or the lifestyle of a whole community for years
to come,'' he said.

   A congresswoman is trying to win the
release of a Dutch visitor who was detained at a Minnesota airport
because he has AIDS.
   Hans Paul Verhoef, 31, of Rotterdam, was being held by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, which declared he cannot
enter the United States with an infectious and communicable
disease, said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
   Verhoef had planned to attend the national Lesbian and Gay
Health Conference that begins in San Francisco on Wednesday,
according to Steve Huber, a conference spokesman.
   ``We do not believe the intent behind the immigration law was to
exclude tourists,'' said Pelosi, who is approaching the U.S.
attorney general for a waiver that would allow Verhoef to proceed
to San Francisco. Federal law prohibits people with AIDS from
visiting the United States without such a waiver.
   Verhoef was taken to the Scott County Jail, about 20 miles from
the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport, after U.S. Customs officials
discovered the drug AZT in his baggage on Sunday, according to a
friend who was with him.
   Steve Morin, an aide to Pelosi, said Verhoef told customs and
immigration employees he had AIDS when he was questioned about the
AZT, a drug used to treat people infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus.
   ``He didn't try to hide it,'' Morin said. ``We also question
this on humanitarian grounds, putting someone in jail under these
circumstances.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Tuesday urged guerrillas
of the South-West African People's Organization to pull back into
Angola and allow the Namibian independence process to get under way.
   The U.S. statement came as fighting continued for the fourth day
in Namibia between thousands of Soviet-backed SWAPO guerrillas and
South African troops and local police.
   ``SWAPO's intention apparently was to establish bases in
Namibia, in clear violation'' of a U.S.-brokered peace agreement
signed last December. The pact, negotiated over two years by
Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, calls for Cuba to
pull its troops out of Angola and for South Africa to grant
independence to neighboring Namibia.
   The agreement went into effect April 1 but was threatened by the
fighting, which has claimed 180 lives, according to police figures
that could not be independently verified.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United
States does not think the agreement is in danger of unraveling ``at
this point.''
   U.S. diplomats are still in touch with the Soviet Union, Cuba
and Angola, asking them to use their influence with SWAPO to
restore calm in Namibia, she said. The United States, for its part,
is asking South Africa to rein in its troops, who were scheduled to
begin demobilizing Sunday once the peace agreement went into effect
and U.N. peacekeepers were deployed.
   ``The United States position is that SWAPO must withdraw the
forces it has sent into Namibia to north of the 16th parallel in
Angola,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. Under the peace agreement, SWAPO
guerrillas were supposed to stay in their Angolan bases, about 100
miles north of the Namibian border.
   She said that despite rebel claims, there was no doubt that the
guerrillas had crossed the border on Saturday.
   Guerrilla officials and the Angolan government claim the
fighters have been in Namibia for some time and fired in self
defense after security forces attacked them.
   Villagers in northern towns, most of whom support the rebels,
said they believe the guerrillas left Angola to return home and did
not expect a fight because the independence process officially has
begun.
   Asked whether the U.N. force, which has just 1,000 of its
planned 4,650 soldiers deployed so far, should have foreseen the
SWAPO incursion, Ms. Tutwiler replied that ``hindsight is always
great, but I don't think anybody anticipated this.''

<HEAD>Shamir's Plan Centers on Elections But Palestinians Reject Terms</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Mideast, Bjt</HEAD>

   The peace proposals Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir will submit to President Bush focus on elections in the
occupied territories to choose Palestinians who would negotiate
with Israel on limited self-government.
   Many prominent Palestinians welcome the idea of balloting but
argue that free elections cannot be held as long as Israeli troops
occupy the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   In interviews and through his aides, Shamir said he was willing
to have Palestinians choose mayors to speak for major population
centers or political figures to represent the whole region.
   The elected Palestinians would then meet with Israeli
negotiators to work out a temporary solution for the 1 million
residents of the West Bank and the 650,000 inhabitants of the Gaza
Strip.
   The most Palestinians could expect from this process would be
limited self-rule with Israeli troops still stationed in the
occupied lands. But Shamir has said troops could be pulled out of
population centers once an autonomy scheme was agreed upon.
   Under Shamir's proposals, the final status of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip would be the subject of further negotiations after
autonomy was implemented.
   Shamir's advisers also hint he is ready to release some
Palestinian prisoners and take other steps to reduce tension.
However, they link any change to a truce in the Palestinian
uprising _ intefadeh in Arabic _ in which 419 Palestinians and 18
Israelis have died since December 1987.
   ``The condition is that life in Judea and Samaria (West Bank)
must return to normal. The intefadeh must end,'' said Yossi
Ahimeir, a Shamir spokesman. The Shamir ideas closely parallel the
1978 U.S.-mediated Camp David Accords signed by Egypt and Israel
but rejected by the Palestinians and Jordan. The major difference
is that Shamir proposes electing negotiators before autonomy is
implemented instead of members of an autonomous council after
self-government is defined in talks.
   ``I believe that this will be the one big and important
contribution that Mr. Shamir is bringing to Washington,'' said an
Israeli official who described the proposal as a ``major change''
in the government's position.
   Shamir, however, rules out direct or indirect talks with the
PLO, which means elected representatives could not act as
intermediaries.
   He gives Palestinians little hope of seeing an end to occupation
because he has rejected Palestinian demands for statehood and
refused to endorse the idea of returning any captured land to Arab
sovereignty.
   In this, the right-wing prime minister takes a harder line than
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Finance Minister Shimon Peres,
the leaders of the left-of-center Labor Party which shares power in
the coalition government.
   Labor supports returning some of the captured land in exchange
for peace agreements.
   Municipal elections have been held twice in the West Bank since
Israel captured the land from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
In the last balloting in 1976, voters chose 23 mayors _ nearly all
of them supporters of the PLO.
   Only six remain in office with most of the rest having been
deported or deposed by Israel for nationalist activities.
   In the Gaza Strip, elections were last held in 1946, under
Egyptian rule.
   The main flaw in Shamir's plan is that he has been unable to
find Palestinians willing to go along with the elections proposal.
But some Palestinians have met secretly with the prime minister or
openly with military officials to discuss the idea.
   Saeb Erakat, a political science professor at the An Najah
University in the West Bank city of Nablus, said that if, as the
PLO has proposed, Israeli troops withdraw and turn over the
occupied territory to U.N. peacekeepers, ``then we will consider
elections.''
   He said electing city officials would be meaningless if
occupation persisted.
   ``Will elected mayors be able to prevent arrests, stop the
deportation of Palestinian leaders, halt the confiscation of land
or the closure of schools? We would just wind up electing people
who have the authority to collect the garbage,'' said Erakat.
   Soon after the uprising against Israeli occupation began, a
group of prominent Palestinians in Jerusalem in January 1988
presented a 14-point list of demands that included a call for
elections.
   The idea was hotly debated among Palestinians until Bethlehem
Mayor Elias Freij proposed a cease-fire in the intefadeh, or
uprising, in exchange for elections and the release of thousands of
Palestinian prisoners.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat responded by threatening to shoot
anyone who proposed a truce and graffiti appeared on Bethlehem
walls threatening Freij's life. Support for the idea rapidly waned.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr and a
proponent of the 14-point list, said there was deep suspicion that
Shamir was meeting with Palestinians and talking about elections in
an effort to perpetuate ``the illusion that there are alternatives
to the PLO.''
   ``So far, what we see from Shamir is an attempt to repackage
what was refused earlier, autonomy under Camp David,'' said
Siniora, a leading moderate.

   He was in the doghouse for digging a
hole in the neighbor's yard, but his owners were comparing their
pet to Lassie after a natural gas leak was found bubbling from the
crater.
   ``Thank God for the dog,'' said Zane Viers, in whose yard the
leak was discovered Sunday.
   Old Yeller, the 9-month-old Labrador retriever, belongs to Tom
and Debi Lale, who live next door.
   The dog must have smelled the gas leak before digging the hole,
both families said. On Sunday, after rain water had collected, Lale
noticed that the water was bubbling. He smelled gas and called KPL
Gas Service.
   The utility sent a crew, which repaired the service line leak
just after midnight.
   The leak posed no immediate danger, said Hal Hudson, KPL Gas
spokesman, but utility policy is to be sensitive to leaks reported
by customers.

   Many of those involved in the fight against
AIDS are lauding cartoonist Garry Trudeau's comic depiction of the
ignorance, unfounded fears and public indifference that sometimes
surround the disease.
   ``Humor is essential for educating people,'' said Rene Durazzo
of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. ``It gets them to look at
themselves without a lot of harsh confrontations; gets them
laughing at their own silly attitudes.''
   In a three-week series of his Doonesbury strip that began March
27 and ends April 15, Trudeau is gently dishing up some rather
biting comments on how the public and government have responded to
the disease.
   Centered around a town hall meeting in San Francisco, part of
character Lacy Davenport's congressional district, the strip so far
has poked fun at fears of getting AIDS through casual contact, the
view that AIDS largely affects only homosexuals and the public's
discomfort at dealing with various sexual issues raised in its
context.
   At one point, the 81-year-old Davenport finds herself unable to
use the word AIDS, instead saying ``the great unpleasantness.''
   A long-time character in the strip, Andy Lippincott, has
developed AIDS.
   Trudeau told a columnist for the Pioneer Press Dispatch of St.
Paul, Minn., this week that he had a ``hard time finding the right
approach'' to AIDS.
   ``I had to strip it (the disease) of its taboos to attack the
fear and ignorance by laughing in its face,'' said Trudeau, who
rarely grants interviews. He did not return a call placed by The AP.
   Brother Kevin Worth, a Roman Catholic monk who works with AIDS
patients at Mother Teresa's Spiritual Resource Center in Oakland,
called Trudeau's AIDS series an ``effective way of uncovering the
public's ignorance'' about AIDS, which destroys the body's immune
system.
   ``Lacy Davenport's unwillingness to name the issue represents a
common response on the part of the American public, much of which
prefers that this disease simply did not exist, or would just go
away,'' he added. ``Trudeau is showing us it will not.''
   According to Lee Salem, a spokesman for Universal Press
Syndicate in Kansas City, Mo., which distributes the comic strip,
only one newspaper has refused to run the series. The Canadian
paper, which he did not identify, considered the series in ``bad
taste.''
   In San Francisco, where 9,000 people are expected to be living
with the disease by the end of the year, the comic strip has been
greeted with guffaws at numerous AIDS organizations.
   Lance Henderson, finance director of The Names Project, which
produces a giant memorial quilt using panels submitted by survivors
of people who have died of AIDS, is posting each segment of the
daily strip on his door.
   But some involved in the fight against AIDS are surprised the
often controversial cartoonist, known for his sharp political wit,
has taken so long to address AIDS issues.
   ``I wish he had done this four years ago,'' said Democratic Rep.
Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco. ``Most of what I've seen so far is a
little after the fact. These issues have been raised before.''
   Carisa Cunningham of the Gay Mens Heath Crisis in New York feels
it is appropriate that Davenport represents a sometimes
ill-informed public and government officials who can be
frustratingly prudish.
   ``He's addressing the issue of denial in Lacy, who in the past
has been a sympathetic character,'' Cunningham said in a telephone
interview.
   ``We aren't meant to hate or despise her because of her
ignorance. It's telling us that even well-meaning people are having
a hard time dealing with AIDS.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters turned out in large numbers to elect a new
mayor Tuesday as front-runner Richard M. Daley sought the office
held by his father for 21 years and chief rival Timothy C. Evans
battled to keep black leadership in City Hall.
   Maverick Republican Edward Vrdolyak was not expected to be much
of a factor in a contest Democrats have won without fail since 1931
_ including six straight terms captured by the late Richard J.
Daley, last of the big-city political bosses.
   A victory by the younger Daley, who defeated Mayor Eugene Sawyer
in February's Democratic primary, would make the nation's
third-largest city by far the biggest in the nation to replace a
black mayor with a white.
   Tom Leach, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Elections, said
that turnout was substantial all morning and appeared headed for a
rate of 71 percent of the 1.56 million registered voters. That
would be the third-highest turnout for a Chicago municipal
election, below the numbers that carried Harold Washington, the
city's first black mayor, to victory in 1983 and 1987.
   There was no early breakdown of how the turnout compared in
mainly white and mainly black precincts.
   The election was ordered by the courts to fill the two years
remaining in the second term of Washington, who died of a heart
attack in November 1987.
   Daley, 46, is a three-term Cook County state's attorney. Evans,
45, is a Democratic South Side alderman who skipped the primary to
run on the Harold Washington Party ticket. Vrdolyak, 51, is a
former Democratic alderman who has not won elected office since his
party switch in 1987.
   A telephone poll released Monday by The Daily Chicago Southtown
Economist and WBBM-TV gave Daley 51 percent to 35 percent for Evans
and 3 percent for Vrdolyak. The poll had a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 points.
   Daley, who planned to visit the graves of his father and infant
son, voted with his wife, Maggie, at a day care center near his
home, joking, ``Now I got two votes.''
   Evans cast his vote and followed it with another prediction of
victory, saying, ``It's been a good struggle.''
   Evans' most prominent supporter, Jesse Jackson, also voted in
the morning, noting Tuesday was the 21st anniversay of civil rights
leader Martin Luther King's slaying.
   ``This is not a day to throw bricks,'' he said. ``We must build
with bricks.''

   Analysts agreed that turnout among black and white voters would
be the critical factor. Whites make up about 48 percent of the
voting population, blacks about 42 percent and Hispanics about 7
percent.
   But the black community that united around Washington appeared
bitterly divided this year between Sawyer and Evans, who refused to
endorse each other.
   In the February primary, Daley beat Sawyer by more than 100,000
votes, in large part because many black Evans supporters stayed
away from the polls.
   Tuesday was Daley's second bid for the mayoralty. He lost in the
three-way 1983 Democratic primary won by Washington.
   Vrdolyak advanced into Tuesday's contest by winning the GOP
primary after a last-minute write-in campaign. Unpopular with
blacks for his City Council opposition to Washington, Vrdolyak
generated little support in the general campaign.
   Daley far outstripped Evans and Vrydolyak in raising campaign
funds, collecting a warchest of about $6.5 million. He also gained
the endorsement of Chicago's two largest daily newspapers.
   Like the primary, the general election was largely free of the
rancor and racial strife that characterized Washington's victories.
   But Evans and his supporters openly appealed to black voters not
to relinquish control of local government to whites. Jackson urged
the black community to ``keep the keys'' to City Hall. And Evans
told a rally last week that Daley was ``getting ready to reopen his
father's plantation.''
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, a black and an ally of
Jackson's, endorsed Daley, a partisan move that angered some blacks.

<HEAD>Refusenik Given Permission to Leave for Medical Treatment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Jewish refusenik whose emigration case had been
pressed by British officials said Tuesday he was given permission
to receive medical treatment in London.
   The case of Georgy Samoilovich has been on a list British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher intends to raise with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is to arrive in London on Wednesday.
   ``Undoubtedly, the two events are connected,'' Samoilovich, 66,
said in a telephone interview. ``This is happening only thanks to
the work of the two governments, the British and the American, and
the work of my friends throughout the world.''
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman speaking on condition of
anonymity said the action ``reflects a considerable achievement in
Anglo-Soviet relations.''
   The list Mrs. Thatcher plans to discuss includes the wife of
Oleg Gordievsky, a top Soviet spy who defected to the West in 1985,
officials confirmed Tuesday. The Foreign Office refused to say how
many people are on the list.
   The Soviet decision came a day after a protest by about 40
refuseniks in front of the British Embassy in Moscow who said they
hoped the talks in London would help resolve their cases.
   Samoilovich, who has life-threatening lymphoma, first applied to
emigrate in 1979. He was sacked from a defense-related job and the
Soviets have refused repeated applications on grounds he was
involved with secret work. Samoilovich argues that everything he
knew is now public material.
   Officials of the Soviet visa office summoned him Tuesday and
told him the prohibition on his emigration due to access to state
secrets had been removed, Samoilovich said.
   Refuseniks accuse Soviet officials of applying regulations that
allow them to deny emigration because of access to secrets in many
inappropriate cases.
   He said he was told he would be allowed to leave for medical
treatment in London, and that his wife Vera and son, Viktor, would
be allowed to emigrate after they submit new documents to Soviet
officials.
   Samoilovich said he hoped to receive his international passport
Wednesday or Thursday after using his internal Soviet passport to
prepare legal documents testifying that the entire family wishes to
leave.
   Once in London he said he hoped not to return to the Soviet
Union, but would wait in Britain for his family. The family hopes
to settle in the United States, where it has close friends,
Samoilovich said.
   Samoilovich has been offered free medical treatment both at
London's state-run Royal Marsden Hospital and in the United States
at the Hackensack Medical College in New Jersey.
   A Geneva-based agency that helps to resettle Soviet Jews said
Tuesday the number who arrived in Vienna in March was 3,893, a
10-year high.
   But it said only 114, or 2.9 percent, wanted to go to Israel.
Most of the rest intended to go to the United States, said Reghina
Boucault, spokeswoman for the Intergovernmental Committee for
Migration.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union reached a peak of 51,328
in 1979 but then dropped sharply and in the mid-1980s only about
1,000 a year were released.
   In the past two years, however, many long-time refuseniks have
been permitted to leave the Soviet Union and the number of emigres
increased to more than 20,000 in 1988.

   An international exchange program on the
ins and outs of sweeping chimneys took place here before 22
visiting Swedes and their American hosts went on to a national
convention Tuesday in San Diego.
   Belleville sweep Hugh Maine borrowed his neighbor's chimney as
the Swedish sweeps and industry representatives learned to clean,
American-style.
   The Swedes then gave the Americans their version of cleaning out
soot.
   Swedish sweeps use feathery, stainless-steel brushes.
   ``We have better equipment to brush and sweep chimneys,'' Maine
said. ``Instead of rods, they use ropes and weights to carry
brushes down the flue.''
   Maine said the Swedish government allows the master sweeps to
wear its coat of arms _ a distinction only shared by the nation's
police _ and the sweeps are government employees responsible for
chimney-related fires.
   Lars-Gunnar Borjesson, vice president of the Swedish Master
Sweep Association, said each region or city in Sweden has one
master chimney sweep.
   With the help of other chimney sweeps, journeymen and
apprentices, the master chimney sweep is responsible for making
sure all chimneys are inspected.
   ``In Sweden, master sweepers are only allowed to inspect
chimneys,'' Borjesson said. ``This is done two times a year if oil
or fuel is used for central heating, every eight weeks if wood is
used for heating purposes.`'

   Boa constrictors, anacondas and
pythons are not uncommon pets, according to a resident who is suing
to hang on to 16 of his household snakes that the city says are
banned from dwellings.
   Eric Larson, 26, says his snakes, the biggest of which is a
13-foot-long, green anaconda named Annie, never slither out of his
apartment.
   City officials were tipped about the snakes by an anonymous
caller in February, said Lori Finazzo, an assistant city attorney.
   ``This is a multiresidential area, and we're not talking about
some small garter snakes,'' she said. ``We have some serious
pythons here.''
   Officials contend Larson is violating an ordinance that
prohibits keeping ``uncommon pets'' within 300 feet of a dwelling.
Common pets include cats, dogs and gerbils. ``Our ordinance is
quite clear, and he's in violation of it,'' Finazzo said.
   Macomb Circuit Judge Raymond Cashen issued a temporary
restraining order against the city last week and set a hearing for
April 24 on Larson's suit.
   Larson, who has kept snakes since he was a child, defended his
pets as quiet.
   ``It's not as bad as a kitty litter box,'' he said. Larson's
lawyer, Charles Langton, says he knows one pet shop owner who sells
300 to 400 boa constrictors and pythons each year.
   ``And that's just one store, so that puts (the big snakes) into
the realm of common pets,'' Langton said. ``There's a lot of snakes
out there. People may not know it, but they're out there.''

<HEAD>US Denies Giving Haiti List of Drug-Trafficking Officers</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP ) _ The State Department denied Tuesday that it
had given the Haitian government a list of officers it wanted
cashiered from the that nation's army because of alleged
involvement in drug trafficking.
   ``No, we did not'' provide such a list, State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler told reporters when she was asked
about the suggestion that the U.S. demand had led to Sunday's
attempted coup d'etat.
   She said that last month Richard Melton, a department envoy,
discussed with Haitian President Prosper Avril ``the broad range of
U.S. interests in Haiti, which would include narcotic cooperation,
along with democratic reforms, respect for human rights and
credible development programs.''
   ``We did not deliver any list of names; nor did we give any kind
of ultimatum,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She said was unable to comment on the announcement by Haitian
state television that the three military commanders who led the
coup attempt had been given safe passage to the United States via
the Dominican Republic.
   Asked whether the trio had sought asylum in the United States,
Ms. Tutwiler said, ``Not that I'm aware of.''
   Haitian radio had reported Thursday that four high-ranking army
officers were discharged for drug trafficking a day after Melton
had tied the resumption of U.S. aid to progress in stopping the
drug trade.
   A $90 million U.S. aid package was suspended after November 1987
elections were aborted by thugs protected by soldiers.

   Although restaurant customers remain their top
priority, America's premier chefs are catering more and more to
charities that are capitalizing on the nation's appetite for fancy
but healthy cuisine.
   ``It's a bit of an ego trip. To be able to say I had dinner last
night with seven of the finest chefs in the United States. If this
is what turns you on, it's a pretty big trip,'' said Robert L.
Becker Jr., board chairman at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   The hospital has invited seven top chefs to dish out their best
at a $1,500-a-person gourmet gala in October. Half the 100 dinner
tickets already have been gobbled up, solely through word of mouth.
   The fund-raising crowd is ``getting bored with always eating
meat and potatoes,'' said Jean Banchet, chef and owner of Le
Francais in Wheeling, Ill., near Chicago. ``They don't eat garbage
anymore. They know more and more about food, all kinds of food.
They're more educated of the palate.''
   Banchet is one of the chefs donating their talents for
Children's Hospital, the world's leading pediatric liver transplant
center. The hospital will launch its 1990 centennial celebration
with the culinary extravaganza.
   At a preview luncheon Monday, Banchet showed off the mille
feuille of duck liver with artichoke, truffle and toast brioche he
will create in October. Cajun cook Paul Prudhomme whipped up his
offering, a creamy crawfish dish served in bread boats and called
Louisiana seafood fantasy.
   The menu also features a consomme of wild mushrooms, grilled
marinated quail, California garden greens, saddle of lamb, and an
apple dessert with kiln-dried cherry sauce and topped with a sugar
dome.
   Gourmet chefs became highly sought after for these kinds of
high-brow fund-raisers in the early 1980s, according to Lawrence
Forgione, chef proprietor of An American Place in New York.
   ``It only came about because of the notoriety of chefs, for lack
of a better word, the star quality of chefs,'' Forgione said.
``What would be the sense if the chefs who are here today had no
influence? Why bother paying to come to this event?''
   Top chefs say they are besieged with requests to donate their
services.
   ``It's worthwhile doing and, hey, it's going to have a lasting
effect. That money is going to pay for a lot of good things. That's
why we do it,'' said Prudhomme, owner of K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen
in New Orleans.
   ``You cannot say yes to all of them,'' said another guest chef,
Jean-Louis Palladin of Jean-Louis at Watergate in Washington.
``Every day of the year, we would be doing that and we cannot
because we have our job to do.''
   Whether it's for charity or for profit, chefs with any
conscience are blending what people want to eat with what they
should eat, according to Ferdinand Metz, president of The Culinary
Institute of America. Under fire are high-calorie, high-cholesterol
foods.
   ``It's not just the responsibility of the chefs to wait and say,
`Well, let's wait to see if they become more sophisticated,' ''
said Metz, who is baking the dessert for the gala. ``We have a
responsibility to lead, and I'm actually somewhat disappointed in
the lack of corporate responsibility that I see on the part of some
of the fastfood people.''
   Education is the main ingredient to healthy eating, and the New
York institute's 22,000 graduates are busy ``spreading the word,''
according to Metz.
   ``The message will get around,'' he said. ``It's an enormous
undertaking, but I think we're making progress.''

   A fire swept through a French tour

   Police and fire boats rescued the 34 passengers and eight crew

   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   It was the second major accident on the Rhine River in West

Oppenheim but was later towed to safety and its cargo transferred

   Rescuers on Tuesday pulled three more
bodies from the wreckage of a train that derailed and slammed into
a station in this southern city, bringing the death toll to eight.
   Authorities said 17 people were injured, one critically, in the
accident Monday. Casualties occurred both on the train and in the
station.
   Police identified the dead as the two train engineers, the chief
of the station and two assistants, a railroad worker, a passenger
on the train and a passenger in the station.
   The eight-car train derailed as it entered the station. Two cars
slammed into the station wall, demolishing the bar, ticket booth,
and freight and baggage section.
   Railroad authorities said the train apparently arrived at the
station at a greater speed than the customary 18 mph. The Italian
news agency AGI reported the train was traveling at more than 60
mph.
   National Transportation Minister Giorgio Santuz ordered an
investigation into the crash.

<HEAD>Lack of Public Affairs Programming Decried</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rights of television viewers are being
trampled by laissez-faire federal regulators who no longer require
TV stations to broadcast public affairs programming, consumer
advocate Ralph Nader said Tuesday.
   Nader, appearing at a news conference to discuss a study that
said there has been a 51 percent decrease in issues-oriented public
affairs TV programs since 1979, called for reinstatement of the
Fairness Doctrine and requirements that broadcasters devote certain
percentages of their broadcasting hours to non-entertainment
programming.
   The Federal Communications Commission in 1987 repealed the
40-year-old Fairness Doctrine, which had required broadcasters to
cover controversial issues. In 1984 the FCC revoked rules that
obligated broadcasters to alot 5 percent of their programming
between 6 a.m. and midnight to local shows, 5 percent to news and
public affairs programs and 10 percent to general interest items
such as as gardening, religion and advice-type shows.
   Nader said the FCC under Chairman Dennis R. Patrick and his
predecessor, Mark S. Fowler, was a ``rogue agency that has
dangerously transformed power from the public to private commerce
in sheer violation of the (1934 Communications Act).''
   Nader said Fowler's view was ``audiences have no First Amendment
rights.'' Fowler, and now Patrick, maintained that marketplace
pressures would force station owners to broadcast issues-oriented
programs.
   That has not happened, Nader said, and the FCC refuses ``to
respect the access rights, the response rights of the audience.''
   Nader said that the FCC has abdicated its responsibility to
monitor the broadcasting industry and that if it had it would have
found an erosion of public interest programming in the wake of the
1984 repeal of the so-called 5-5-10 guidelines.
   The study by Essential Information, a public interest group that
Nader founded in 1982, examined TV listings for programs at 217
stations in 50 markets on seven days in early 1988.
   The listings were compared with FCC-required program logs from
1975, 1978 and 1979. The study did not include cable TV.
   Jim Donahue, who wrote the study, said, ``The results show a 51
percent decrease between 1979 and 1988 in the average percentage of
issue-oriented public affairs programming.''
   He also said that ``the average percentage of time devoted to
public affairs has decreased 39 percent, with 30 percent of ABC,
CBS and NBC affiliates and 63 percent of Fox Broadcasting
affiliates neglecting to air a locally produced public affairs
program.''
   Donahue's study also showed there has been an 74 percent
increase in news programs, and sharp increases in home shopping,
real estate and program-length ``commercials'' such as how to lose
weight or get rich.
   FCC spokesman John Kamp said the report ``sounds terribly bogus.
We have increased the number of stations over the last 10 years,
both television and radio, by half and news and public affairs
programming makes money. I find it incredible to think that the
amount of this programming would go down. So I don't know how he
counted it, but I think it's subect to being recounted.''
   Regarding the Fairness Doctrine, Kamp said the ``commission
found that it decreased the amount of public interest programming
available, ... which was the opposite of what it was intended to
do.''

<HEAD>Five Cities Vote for Mayor; Alabama Chooses Congressman</HEAD>

   People in five major Midwest cities voted for mayor Tuesday,
with Chicago residents turning out in heavy numbers to decide
whether Richard M. Daley should inherit his father's job. Democrats
fought to retain a House seat in Alabama.
   In Winnetka, Ill., residents voted on a non-binding handgun ban
prompted by a shooting spree at a local elementary school last May.
A woman carrying three handguns killed an 8-year-old boy and
wounded several others before committing suicide.
   And just outside Kansas City, two white supremacists were
seeking local offices in a bitter contest in Northmoor, Mo.
   Besides Chicago, cities where voters were choosing mayors
included St. Louis, Madison, Wis., and Wichita, Kan. In Omaha,
Neb., seven mayoral candidates ran in a primary election to pick
two finalists for the May 9 general election.
   Kansas City, Mo., voters considered whether to strengthen the
power of their mayor's office.
   The only statewide race pitted an incumbent state Supreme Court
justice in Wisconsin against an appeals court judge who accused her
of being soft on crime.
   A Democrat was favored to win the Alabama congressional seat
left vacant by the death of Democratic Rep. Bill Nichols. Secretary
of State Glen Browder was considered the frontrunner in a
rough-and-tumble race against Republican state Sen. John Rice for
the 3rd District seat in the House.
   In Chicago, Daley, a Democrat and the son of the late Mayor
Richard J. Daley, led in pre-election polls against independent
candidate Timothy Evans and Republican Edward Vrdolyak. They were
vying to fill the last two years of the late Mayor Harold
Washington's term.

   Race was the underlying issue in Chicago, where elections tend
to divide voters by color more than party. Daley, 46, the Cook
County state's attorney, captured overwhelming white support in the
February Democratic primary to oust the city's second black mayor,
Eugene Sawyer.
   Sawyer had been appointed acting mayor following Washington's
death in November 1987. His chief rival at the time had been Evans,
a fellow black Democratic alderman who later formed the Harold
Washington Party.
   Sawyer was supported in the primary election by Jesse Jackson, a
Chicagoan who casts a long shadow in local elections. Jackson then
abandoned the Democratic nominee _ Daley _ to endorse Evans, 45, in
the general election.
   Vrdolyak, 51, was the wild card in the race. The former
Democratic alderman had been Washington's arch-foe but has been
unable to win elective office since switching to the Republican
Party in 1987.
   Although the Chicago race occasionally lived up to the city's
feisty political tradition, it was tame compared to the
bare-knuckle Alabama congressional race.
   Browder, 46, a former political science professor, adopted a
get-tough strategy to counter Rice's liberal-bashing. Rice, 37, a
real estate developer, had labeled Browder a liberal, a liar and a
``wimp.''
   Browder, casting aside his image as a mild-mannered reformer,
castigated Rice as an ``off-the-wall radical'' and ran television
advertisements showing the Republican as a hand-grenade threatening
to blast funds to the elderly in half.
   The Alabama race was one of three special congressional
elections this spring. In Indiana, Democrat Jill Long defeated
Republican Dan Heath last week in a race to fill a vacant seat once
held by Vice President Dan Quayle. Voters in Wyoming will choose a
successor to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on April 26.

<HEAD>Leak Problem Prolongs Nuke Plant Shutdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Turkey Point nuclear plant already off line
because operators failed routine retesting was shut down completely
after technicians discovered a tiny cooling-water leak, officials
said Tuesday.
   The leak was found in the weld around a tube holding instruments
that measure conditions in the core of the Unit 3 reactor, said
Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Ken Clark.
   Several leaking and cracked tubes were found in the same
location in January, forcing Florida Power &amp; Light Co. to shut the
reactor down at that time as well.
   ``A weeping tube in and of itself normally is not serious, but a
situation like this deteriorates, and the utility usually shuts it
down,'' Clark said.
   Until the leak was discovered Saturday, Unit 3 had been on ``hot
standby'' in the wake of the NRC's discovery that half of the plant
operators taking regular recertification tests had failed. The leak
forced the utility to completely shut down the reactor.
   NRC examiners are expected to review later in the week the
performance of all the plant's reactor operators, a process that
usually takes several days.
   Repairing the leak and retesting the reactor and the
cooling-water system will delay Unit 3's restart even longer,
utility spokeswoman Stacey Shaw said. The utility originally had
hoped to get the reactor back on line by the weekend, but the
delays are likely to add another week, she said.
   ``We're moving along a step at a time,'' said Ms. Shaw.
   The other Turkey Point reactor, Unit 4, is down for routine
refueling and is projected to go back on line in mid- to late
April, she said.
   The NRC has hit Turkey Point with about $1 million in fines over
the past five years for safety and security violations, identifying
the plant as one of the nation's 10 worst. Ralph Nader's
environmental group, Public Citizen, has also called it one of the
worst-managed commercial facilities.

<HEAD>Peru Attack Reveals Weakness in Halting Rebel Insurgency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is losing its battle against
leftist insurgents, newspapers and magazines said Tuesday, one week
after guerrillas wiped out a jungle police post, killing 13 and
injuring 14 others.
   Last week, 24 policemen and 26 villagers died in other violence
linked to the rebel group known as the Shining Path.
   Also on Tuesday, leftist Tupac Amaru rebels exploded six bombs
in downtown Lima, wounding two pedestrians and causing minor
damage. On Monday, Shining Path guerrillas killed 10 men and women
in central Huancavelica state for selling food to soldiers.
   But less than a month ago, the government vowed to review its
anti-insurgency policy, which media reports said is compromised by
the country's economic crisis and mismanagement.
   In the police post attack, troops reached Uchiza only 12 hours
after fighting began, even though Prime Minister Armando Villanueva
was in touch by radio throughout and promised quick reinforcements,
news reports said.
   Uchiza, located 245 miles northeast of Lima, is an hour's flight
from Lima and five minutes by helicopter from a police base in
Santa Lucia. Officials said soldiers could not reach the town
earlier because bad weather prohibited flights, and travel by land
was ruled out for fear of mines.
   ``The explanations have not been satisfactory. They are open to
further questioning,'' said El Comercio, Peru's leading newspaper,
in an editorial.
   Political infighting and poor coordination among police,
military and the government have crippled the fight against
insurgents, the newspaper said.
   ``Police have once again paid with blood for the incapacity of
this government to confront terrorism,'' according to the Lima
magazine, Oiga.
   Caretas, another magazine, said the attack highlighted the
insurgency's superiority in manpower and weapons.
   The government is strapped by Peru's worst economic crisis this
century. Inflation is expected to reach 10,000 percent this year.
   Rumors of military coups have surfaced repeatedly in the past
six months.
   More than 14,000 deaths and $10 billion in damage have been
attributed to the Shining Path guerrillas since 1980, when the
rebels turned from propaganda to violence in their fight for a
Marxist state.
   Uchiza is situated in the heart of Peru's cocaine-producing
jungle, where rebels protect drug runners in exchange for weapons
and money.

<TEXT>
   Dan Lawn finds it hard to stay calm
when he slips and slides along a rocky beach, pointing at animals
dead and dying in a layer of crude oil spilled from the Exxon
Valdez.
   He pointed to the skeleton of a recently dead otter on the
beach, its bones picked clean.
   ``Here's an example of why we have to get dead animals and birds
out of here,'' Lawn said. ``The eagles eat them. They ingest the
oil in the fur, and they will eventually die, too.''
   Acrid fumes from the black crude filled nostrils and watered
eyes as Lawn, district chief of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, and his party of two jumped from a
helicopter. Oil, so black it seemed to suck light, smothered the
mossy rocks, an inch thick in places.
   ``Welcome to refinery beach,'' said state official Richard
Fineberg.
   The North Slope Crude, once bound for West coast refineries,
went on for miles, up and down the east shoreline of this once lush
and wild island. It's a tiny stretch of an estimated 800 miles of
shoreline hit with oil after the tanker hit a reef near Valdez to
the northeast.
   ``Look there,'' said Lawn, pointing just off-shore at something
splashing feebly. ``That's an otter. He's just out there in black
oil. Oil's just black. That otter will die soon.''
   Fineberg worried about the brown and black bears in the
spruce-covered mountains rearing from the beach. How will they fish
or find other food when they leave their winter dens?
   They will die, Lawn said.
   ``That spash. That's a seal,'' he said, pointing just offshore
at the velvety blanket of oil undulating on the water. ``That seal
is going to die,'' Lawn said. ``That thing floating next to it is
already dead. It's probably an otter.''
   Down the beach, Lawn spotted something else snorting and diving.
``That sea lion is swimming in black oil. There's no clean water
out there for him to swim in. That sea lion, in a few days, will be
dead,'' he said.
   ``There's no clean water. Where's he going to go?''
   Up ahead, gulls, some partly oiled, sat on tall black rocks.
``They're trying to stay out of the water,'' Lawn said. They don't
have to dive for a living like some ducks and seabirds.
   Lawn gets very mad when he thinks about people who fly over the
island and think the devastation is not severe because they can't
see the dead, oil-covered animals.
   ``The problem is you can't see them,'' Lawn said. ``They're so
damn black that unless they move you just can't see them. You
almost step on them. They crawl into little crevasses to get away
from this terrible thing, whatever it is. They don't know what this
stuff is.''

<HEAD>Czechoslovak Court Upholds Sentences Against Activists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court on Tuesday convicted an
activist for distributing leaflets and sentenced him to four months
in prison Tuesday, and an appeals court upheld sentences for seven
others in a crackdown on dissent.
   The court in the central city of Brno convicted Jarolsav Popelka
of disturbing public order, said dissident sources in Prague.
   Popelka, 32, was arrested March 24. He had handed out flyers
last year calling for the resignation of a hard-line communist
leader and for genuine reforms and environmental protection.
   Also on Tuesday, Judge Jan Roit upheld convictions against Jana
Petrova, a 22-year-old peace activist, and Ota Veverka, 32,
stemming from banned protests in January, said Charter 77 activist
Anna Sabatova. On Feb. 22, Ms. Petrova was sentenced to nine months
in prison and Sabatova received 12 months in prison.
   Ms. Petrova and Veverka were among dissidents who tried to lay
flowers Jan. 16 in Wenceslas Square in memory of Jan Palach, a
student who burned himself alive 20 years earlier to protest the
presence of Soviet troops in his homeland following the 1968
invasion that crushed communist-led reforms.
   The appeal hearing also left unchanged suspended sentences for
five other activists, Charter 77 signatories Jana Sternova and
David Nemec, Petr Placak of the youth group Czech Children,
Stanislav Penc of the John Lennon Peace Club and Charter 77
spokesman Alexander Vondra. They had received suspended sentences
ranging between two and six months at the Feb. 22 trial.
   More than 50 supporters applauded and cheered the defendants at
Prague Municipal Court and chanted ``We are with you!'' when the
seven were escorted out, said sources speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Security was reported tight in the area and police checked
identities of those entering the court.
   In Moravia, south of Brno, the trial of Charter 77 activist
Tomas Hradilek began Tuesday, Ms. Sabatova told The Associated
Press in Vienna.
   Hradilek, one of this year's Charter spokesmen, has been charged
with inciting others to rebellion through mass media and slandering
the country abroad. He could face a jail term of up to five years.
   Officials postponed a third trial scheduled for Tuesday against
two activists who protested police brutality used to disperse the
crowds in January, said activists and emigre sources contacted in
Vienna.
   Vlasta Chramostova and Libusa Silhanova, both Charter 77
signatories, face up to one year in jail for a letter they wrote
protesting the police break-up of the banned rallies. No new date
was set for their trial, the sources said.
   The police violence in January also drew criticism from
thousands of establishment intellectuals who signed at least three
different petitions to the government protesting the police actions
and the detention of prominent dissidents including banned
playwright Vaclav Havel.
   Havel was sentenced to nine months in prison in February in
connection with the January demonstrations. His sentence was
reduced by one month by an appeals court March 21.

   In a gesture of solidarity with an embattled
country, 68 French journalists, artists and intellectuals applied
together Tuesday to become citizens of Lebanon.
   The group, including journalist Jean-Francois Revel, film
director Rene Tavernier and philosopher Andre Glucksmann, presented
their applications at the Lebanese Embassy.
   In a statement, they said Lebanese citizenship was ``synonymous
with independence, with coexistence among peoples and religions.''
   ``Without of course renouncing our nationality, we wish to
acquire Lebanese nationality as well, to share _ at least
symbolically _ the fate of a country threatened with death,'' the
statement said.
   Hundreds of other people accompanied the group when they
presented their applications, waving Lebanese flags and banners
reading ``Save Our Lebanon.''
   Lebanon has been torn by civil war for 14 years.

   A glittering collection of gold jewelry and
ornaments from West Africa, where gold was shunned in ancient times
as an evil spirit, begins a three-year, nine-city tour of the
United States on Wednesday at the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of African Art.
   The handiwork of goldsmiths from Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali and
Senegal comes from the private Barbier-Mueller Museum of Geneva,
which houses one of the finest collections of African gold
sculpture in the world.
   More than 150 handmade objects, comprising about half of the
Barbier-Mueller collection, are going on display at the
Smithsonian. They include elaborate necklaces, rings, hair jewels,
pendants, masks, earrings, beads and ceremonial regalia such as
gold-decorated fly whisks, sword handles and staffs.
   Guest curator Timothy Garrard, a British historian and authority
on the gold trade in West Africa, said gold dust and nuggets long
were regarded with fear by natives who believed they would cause
blindness and insanity.
   Africans began their goldsmith traditions in the 5th century,
when European traders, alerted by slave merchants, sailed down the
west coast of Africa or crossed the Sahara Desert in caravans from
North Africa to trade salt and spices for gold.
   Very little of ancient West African gold jewelry exists today
because it was lost in trade, looted from burial grounds and melted
down to make coins or new ornaments. Garrard said the oldest piece
in the Smithsonian show probably is a fish pendant in pure gold _
about 22 carats _ from 18th century Ghana.
   After the show closes at the National Museum of African Art on
Aug. 28, it is scheduled to travel through July 1992 to art museums
in New York; Dallas; Birmingham, Ala.; Tampa, Fla.; Chicago;
Detroit; Indianapolis, and Louisville, Ky.

   Mary V. Bicouvaris, a Greek immigrant who
survived her country's Nazi occupation and brought her perspective
to high school classes in American government, was named National
Teacher of the Year on Tuesday.
   Mrs. Bicouvaris, the 38th recipient of the award, was not even a
citizen when she began teaching in Hampton, Va., in 1963. But she
became one five years later and ``developed a love for democracy
that has become her teaching trademark,'' said Virginia School
Superintendent S. John Davis.
   Mrs. Bicouvaris, 49, said her formula for teaching government
and international relations combines ``respect for my job, love for
the children that I teach, and a very sincere commitment to make a
difference.''
   She is a teacher at Bethel High School in Hampton.
   Known to her students as Mrs. Bic, she founded and directs an
award-winning Model United Nations program at her school and
organized a schoolwide celebration of the 200th anniversary of the
Constitution. Her teaching ideas on the Constitution were turned
into a booklet circulated among educators nationwide.
   Asked if her students take citizenship seriously, Mrs.
Bicouvaris said no teen-ager in any country does so. ``Our kids,
they may not wave the flag. But they love this country. ... I find
our kids very protective and very loving. I don't worry about it,''
she said.
   But she added that ``I tell my students that I will haunt you if
the day comes that it is time to vote and you don't vote.''
   In response to questions, Mrs. Bicouvaris offered advice to
everyone from parents and students to President Bush.
   For parents, particularly of young children, she urged them to
provide a quiet place, books, love and talk, and get heavily
involved in their children's schooling. ``Take the task very
seriously,'' she said. ``It's like having a prize horse and
developing (it) for that big race.''
   For students, she said, simply ``showing up at the door of the
schoolhouse'' is not enough. She also urged students to make school
rather than jobs their priority during high school.
   ``Many students work nowadays. ... They are very busy people,''
Mrs. Bicouvaris said. ``What I find deplorable many times is they
work school into the business schedule rather than fit business
into the school schedule.''
   For Bush, scheduled to present her with a crystal apple on
Wednesday, Mrs. Bicouvaris said she would ask him to follow up his
pledges to be an education president with ``the action needed to
make education truly a priority. ... I would like him to put the
emphasis on education as an investment and not as an expense.''
   The National Teacher of the Year award is sponsored by the
Council of Chief State School Officers, Encyclopaedia Britannica
Inc. and Good Housekeeping magazine. Mrs. Bicouvaris was selected
over three other finalists from Maryland, Louisiana and California.
She will spend the next year speaking to civic groups and other
organizations around the country.
   When Mrs. Bicouvaris was 5, her father was killed by the Nazis
occupying Greece. Her uncle was rounded up with 39 other people and
shot to death in retaliation for the death of a German.
   She came here at 20 and secured her first teaching job in her
husband's home state of Virginia when the Hampton school system
waived a rule that all teachers must be American citizens. She
became a citizen in 1968.
   Mrs. Bicouvaris said in a recent interview that surviving
oppression in her Greek homeland has given her a perspective on
American government that most teachers don't have.
   ``I have been fortunate to have been in two worlds,'' she said.
``I have seen how things have been when there is war, when there is
oppression. It has given me a further appreciation, I believe, for
freedom. It has given me a further appreciation for opportunity for
all.''

   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias on Tuesday
said President Bush's efforts on Central American peace are welcome
after the ``lip service'' of the Reagan years, and should be an
example for the Cubans and Soviets.
   Arias, who met separately with Bush and Vice President Dan
Quayle, endorsed the administration's plan for non-lethal aid to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, a plan developed with bipartisan
support from congressional leaders.
   ``Now people here can talk with one single voice,'' he said, in
contrast to years of division among members of Congress and the
Reagan administration.
   As for the situation in Nicaragua itself, he said he was
concerned about the elections scheduled for February 1990 and said
steps assuring fairness must be taken, including giving all parties
access to television and other mass media.
   Asked whether the nearly $50 million in non-military aid
recommended for the Contras would not undermine the Central
American presidents' proposal to disband the rebel army, Arias told
reporters, ``These people need some support.''
   He said disbanding of the Contras and returning them to
Nicaragua must occur simultaneously with democratic reforms by the
Sandinista government.
   The U.S. decision not to revive military aid to the Contras
should spur reciprocal action by the Cubans and Soviets in El
Salvador, added the Costa Rican, who won the Nobel peace prize for
his efforts in bringing the five Central American presidents to a
regional accord in 1987.
   Arias said he told Cuban President Fidel Castro that in view of
the Bush's emphasis on non-military Contra aid, ``It was time for
him ... if he supports our peace plan ... to stop supporting the
guerrillas in El Salvador.''
   Arias also urged action by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
who is currently on a visit to Cuba.
   ``If he supports sincerely the Central American peace plan he
has to ... persuade Fidel Castro not to keep the support of the
guerrillas in El Salvador. War has taught us in Central America
that violence is not the solution. We have learned that we must
change bullets by ballots and we can only do this with the support
of the Cubans and the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   The United States has accused the Soviets, through their aid to
Cuba and Nicaragua, of supporting the leftist rebels in El Salvador
where the government is backed by the United States.
   U.S. officials also estimate that the Soviets provide $1 billion
a year, half in military aid and half in economic assistance, to
the Nicaraguan government opposed by the U.S.-backed Contras.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that
reported remarks by Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov about Soviet
opposition to ``export of revolution'' were very encouraging in
terms of Central America.
   Those comments ``could be very significant if they mean the
reduction of Soviet military support in Nicaragua or if they mean
that Soviet surrogates would cease supporting'' guerrillas in El
Salvador, said Fitzwater.
   In his Oval Office meeting with Bush, Arias spoke of a need to
have the United States and other democracies scrutinize the
election rules set up by the Nicaraguan government as well as next
February's election itself, an administration source said.
   Later, Arias told reporters in a photo session with Quayle that
the Nicaraguans must allow establishment of an independent
television station, with access by opposition parties, as part of
the proof that its elections will be free and fair.
   The Central American presidents had agreed that ``there should
be equal opportunity and equal access to all mass media by all
political parties. Otherwise it will be very difficult to talk
about free elections,'' he said.
   He also said time must be allowed for such things as voter
registration and fair campaigning.
   Comparing the Bush administration to the Reagan years, Arias
said, ``I breathe a new atmosphere, a new environment, because I
have no doubts Mr. Bush and the Bush administration is going to
sincerely support the Guatemala accord, the Arias plan'' for
Central American peace.
   ``This is something that in the past that I got some lip service
when people mentioned they were happy with our efforts to
democratize and bring peace to Central America, the neogtiating
table,'' Arias said about the Reagan years. ``I think that now they
are quite sincere and they are doing what they are doing in good
faith.''
   He said he had discussed with Bush his concerns about making
sure the Nicaraguan elections are fair.
   ``I am really worried as a Costa Rican about the organization of
the next elections,'' he said, though he also said he has no reason
to doubt the Sandinistas commitment to fulfilling their promises.
   He noted arguments about whether the Contras should lay down
their arms following democratization moves by the Sandinistas, or
whether they should be dismantled as a fighting force first.
   ``I think this should be simultaneous,'' he said. ``With
repatriation there should be a democratic climate in Nicaragua or
there is no reason for them to go back.''

<HEAD>Beef Shortage is Danger Sign for Brazil's Anti-Inflation Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When beef began to disappear from
supermarkets last month and butchers took to the streets against
illegal price increases, many Brazilians had a sinking feeling of
deja vu.
   Three years ago, powerful cattle ranchers defied a nationwide
price freeze aimed at halting runaway 1,000 percent inflation. The
shortages and black marketeering that followed doomed the
government's plan.
   Now it seemed to be happening again.
   The beef crisis alarmed the government. President Jose Sarney
called the shortage sabotage and said it threatened the fledgling
democracy under which Brazil on Nov. 15 will hold its first
presidential election in 29 years.
   Brazil will not tolerate ``speculation, fraudulent withholding
of goods (and) crimes against the economy,'' Sarney said last week
in a weekly nationwide radio program.
   ``Politicking and economic disorganization threaten the
transition to democracy,'' said Sarney, a civilian who took office
in 1985 after 21 years of military rule.
   Inflation reached 28.8 percent a month in December, then fell to
3 percent for 11 days in February after the government froze
prices. But the cost of living rose 6 percent in March, far above
government predictions.
   Problems began soon after Sarney on Jan. 15 announced a national
wage-and-price freeze as part of his ``Summer Plan,'' Brazil's
fourth anti-inflation program in three years.
   Shortages soon began to occur. Eggs, auto parts and cooking oil
became scarce as suppliers said they couldn't meet demand at the
government-set price. The government acted swiftly, negotiating a
tax break for auto industries and seizing 3.8 million cans of oil
in a supermarket warehouse.
   Federal police even detained the supermarket's owner, Abilio
Diniz, president of the Pao de Acucar chain and one of Brazil's
wealthiest businessmen, on charges of ``crimes against the public
economy.''
   But the government was impotent against cattlemen, for centuries
a powerful and independent clan in Latin America's largest country.
   Cattle breeders raised the price of beef to wholesalers from $18
for each 32-pound unit in January to $23 in March. But wholesalers
who tried to pass on the higher costs were fined by federal
price-checkers and many simply stopped sales altogether.
   In many cities, butcher shops sold meat on the black market or
closed their doors. Supermarkets rationed beef to customers.
   Butchers in cars and ox-carts marched through downtown Sao
Paulo, Brazil's biggest city and financial center, to protest the
price increases. Riot troops broke up the march with water jets
colored with pink dye.
   The government vowed not to repeat the mistakes of 1986, when
federal police on horseback and in helicopters tried to find cattle
allegedly hidden in pastures. Police caught only a few cows for
slaughter, and the government was ridiculed.
   This time, officials threatened to ban beef exports and audit
the tax returns of price violators. But the ranchers didn't budge.
   In April, the government agreed to discuss a price increase for
meat to save its anti-inflation program.
   Politics and inflation are closely linked in this country of 144
million. Past failed attempts to halt inflation caused the
popularity of Sarney's center-right government to plummet and
helped leftist parties to sharp gains in November municipal
elections.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Couple In Adoption Case Gripping Italy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PIA HINCKLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The law prevailed over the heart Tuesday as a family
court refused to return a 3-year-old Filipino girl to the Italian
couple who illegally adopted her.
   The case of Serena Cruz has gripped Italy for weeks, provoking
newspaper editorials, petition drives and even a hunger strike.
   The tearful parents, Rosanna and Francesco Giubergia, announced
they will appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg, France, to get the child back.
   The case focused attention on Italy's adoption system and the
reasons that have led hundreds of Italian families to look abroad
to adopt children.
   ``The family violated the codes of the law but not those of the
heart,'' said an editorial in Il Popolo, newspaper of the dominant
Christian Democrat Party.
   Serena was brought to Italy from the Phillipines by the
Giubergia family in January 1987 and taken away from them by a
judge last month.
   The couple, from Racconigi, near Turin, admitted they lied in
the adoption procedure to skirt the red tape. Francesco Giubergia,
36, head of shipping for the state railway in Turin, had gone to
Manila and declared that he fathered the child.
   The couple legally adopted a Filipino boy in 1985 after Mrs.
Giuberia, 34, was advised by her doctors not to have children.
   A judge ruled they could no longer have custody of Serena on
grounds it would only encourage illegal adoptions, and placed the
child in an orphanage March 16.
   In Tuesday's ruling, the Family Court in Turin said the child
had not suffered psychological damage from the three-week
separation and therefore will be placed with a new, legal family.
   Residents of Racconigi, 20 miles southwest of Turin, have formed
a ``Committee of Solidarity with Serena'' and gathered 70,000
signatures on a petition urging President Francesco Cossiga to
intervene.
   Cossiga asked Justice Minister Giuliano Vassalli to look into
the case. Vassalli then met with the family but said the court had
the right to decide.
   According to a report released last week by the Institute for
Political and Social Studies in Rome, requests for adoption of
foreign children in Italy have increased as much as 1,000 percent
between 1984 and 1987.
   The report, entitled ``A House for Every Child: 1984-1987,''
said that about three-quarters of the foreign adoptions in Italy
are not done through official procedures and are legalized only
after the child has been brought to the country.

<HEAD>Ex-Official Says He Took Money from Defense Consultants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Navy procurement official said
Tuesday that he took thousands of dollars from defense consultants
in return for providing inside information that would help private
companies get military contracts.
   Stuart E. Berlin, who headed an aviation systems branch of the
Navy procurement command, made the admission at the trial of three
Teledyne Electronics Inc. executives accused of conspiring to bribe
him to influence the award of an equipment contract.
   Berlin testified that he had received at least $2,000 in cash
from a defense consultant in return for providing detailed
information about an equipment contract Teledyne was seeking from
the Pentagon.
   On cross-examination, defense attorney Mark Tuohey III said:
``You've been selling your country short for money for 10 years?''
   ``I have taken money for 10 years,'' Berlin said, acknowledging
receipt of thousands of dollars in payments that Tuohey listed.
   On direct testimony, Berlin told jurors that he received two
$1,000 cash payments, and possibly a third, from consultant Fred H.
Lackner after providing detailed status reports about the
Pentagon's decision to buy hand-held radar test devices.
   Berlin, who pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and bribery
last month, said he fed information to Lackner during monthly
meetings they had from mid-1985 to June 1988.
   ``Everything I knew or could find out about the procurement was
passed on to Mr. Lackner,'' Berlin said. He testified that Lackner
told him that he was relaying the information to William L. Parkin,
a defense consultant retained by Teledyne.
   But Lackner, who has also pleaded guilty, testified later in the
day that he received only sporadic reports from Berlin and got no
information at all during 1986.
   ``He was passing this on to Mr. Parkin, who was in turn passing
this on to Teledyne,'' Berlin said. He testified that he had
expected to receive about $25,000, a one-fourth share of the
$100,000 that Parkin was to be paid by Teledyne for his services.
   But Lackner testified that he and Parkin and another
co-conspirator agreed to tell Berlin they were sharing $100,000
instead of $150,000, the amount they expected to receive from
Teledyne, adding: ``Everyone felt he really didn't do anything to
aid the procurement.''
   Parkin also pleaded guilty in the case and may testify as a
prosecution witness against the three defendants: George Kaub;
Eugene R. Sullivan, and Dale Schnittjer.
   The defense contends that the three Teledyne executives knew
nothing about the illegal activities of Parkin, Lackner and Michael
Savaides, the company's Washington lobbyist, who has also pleaded
guilty in the case.
   Earlier in the day, however, former Teledyne vice president
William Rosen testified that he had attended a meeting during which
Kaub and Sullivan agreed to hire Parkin and pay him $150,000 if
Teledyne obtained the contracts.
   Rosen conceded on cross-examination that he did not know whether
the agreement with Parkin he helped draft was ever executed.
   Rosen said he had hired Savaides on Berlin's recommendation.
   Berlin said Lackner had repeatedly over 15 years offered to go
into business with him, proposing arrangements to provide inside
information to defense contractors for a price.
   Berlin said he spurned those offers until mid-1985, when Lackner
proposed a deal involving Teledyne. ``I told him yes, that I could
help him.''
   During a subsequent meeting Lackner said that ``he did have a
contact who would work with Teledyne and it looked like this could
be profitable for all of us,'' Berlin added.
   ``He told me that it was Bill Parkin. He said Bill Parkin had a
relationship with Teledyne and could easily get a contract with
Teledyne.''
   Berlin added that Lackner said that ``he needed quantity and
budget information'' that would enable Teledyne to know the scope
of the potential contract. Berlin said he was supposed to ``keep
him posted on what was happening in the Navy and the Air Force _ a
daily status report.''
   Berlin explained to U.S. District Court jurors that much of the
information he passed to Lackner was not supposed to be released to
the defense industry because ``it could possibly give one
competitor an unfair advantage over another.''
   By the spring of 1987, Berlin said that Lackner complained that
``he was having difficulty getting paid from Teledyne.''
   The former Navy procurement official said that he suggested
several ways of pressuring Teledyne, including raising the
possibility that the contract would be terminated or that the full
three-year term of the order would not be completed.
   Berlin said that Lackner told him ``he was going to threaten
them with termination of the existing contract and use any leverage
he could'' to get paid.
   Berlin said that, six months later, Lackner reported that he was
to share a quarter of the $100,000 that Teledyne had agreed to pay.

<HEAD>DeConcini: GAO Refutes Politics Charge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politics did not sway the Energy Department's
choice of Texas for the super collider, according to a study of the
site selection process by the General Accounting Office, Sen.
Dennis DeConcini said Tuesday.
   DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat, requested the audit by Congress'
investigative arm after senators from some of the six other
finalist states charged politics was behind the DOE's decision to
locate the $4.6 billion particle accelerator at a site south of
Dallas.
   The Texas site was announced days after adopted-Texan George
Bush was elected president. It was picked instead of sites in
Arizona, Michigan, Illinois, North Carolina, Tennessee and Colorado.
   ``To me it looked like it was political at the time. It doesn't
look as much that way now,'' DeConcini said. ``Arizona lost it fair
and square,'' although he said he was ``sorry to admit'' Texas had
the better site.
   ``Our limited analysis provided us no reason to question the
decision to site the super collider in Texas,'' the GAO said in
testimony that will be given Wednesday at a House hearing on the
site selection process.
   ``We found that the task force evaluated and rated the proposed
sites in accordance with the technical and cost criteria, and
provided evidence to support its ratings,'' GAO said.
   DeConcini, who was briefed by GAO on Tuesday, said the study
resolves his concerns about the selection process and he is now
ready to support the particle accelerator in Congress, where it
faces an uncertain future as the DOE seeks approval and money to
begin construction.
   ``Had it been a political decision, I would have washed my hands
of support,'' DeConcini said.
   The GAO, however, said it had unresolved technical questions
about tunneling in Illinois for the 53-mile underground ring, the
theory used to evaluate the electrical power subcriterion, and the
impact of caves in Tennessee on that proposed site.
   ``GAO's verdict is no surprise to those of us who have been
heavily involved in pushing the project forward in recent years.
Texas won the super collider for the best of reasons: hard work and
technical merit,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican.
   DeConcini said he would support funding the project on a
``limited basis'' because money is tight and he doesn't want to see
other science projects, especially in Arizona, cut to pay for the
collider.
   DeConcini is a member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee
on energy and water development, which will decide the collider's
funding.
   The Bush administration is seeking $250 million for the
collider, including $160 million for initial construction, in next
year's budget.
   This is the third year the Energy Department has asked Congress
to authorize construction.
   Last year, Congress appropriated $100 million although the
president had requested $363 million to begin initial construction,
pushing back the targeted date of completion. The project is now
targeted to be built by 1998, instead of the original 1996
completion, said DOE spokesman Jeff Sherwood.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 4th `Election results' with Tass report
on Leningrad meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Voters in one out of every eight Soviet
parliamentary districts refused to elect anyone even though they
had a choice of only one or two candidates, according to official
results released Tuesday.
   The Tass news agency released the Central Election Commission's
final tally of the votes from March 26 elections for the country's
new 2,250-member Congress of Peoples Deputies.
   Tass said that in 195 of the 1,500 geographical districts across
the country, no one got a majority of the vote even though there
were only one or two candidates. In those districts, new electoral
campaigns will be waged and a second election will be held May 14,
Tass said.
   Election results released earlier showed that in the first
nationwide multicandidate election in 70 years voters rejected many
top-ranking Communist Party and government leaders. They included
Yuri Solovyev, a candidate member of the ruling Politburo, who ran
unopposed in Leningrad.
   Tass said a meeting of Leningrad party leaders Tuesday, led by
Solovyev, characterized the election results as a ``serious
political lesson.''
   ``Leningrad residents are not satisfied with the tempo of
solving the housing problem, the equipping of the city, the
ecological situation,'' the agency said. ``They express
dissatisfaction with the shortage of industrial and food products
and concern about the growth of crime,'' Tass said.
   Among those who also suffered defeat were the Kiev party leader
and mayor, the mayor and second-leading party official in Moscow
and a host of regional party chiefs.
   ``In the majority of cases, the reason for this is the striving
of the people to quicken the process of restructuring, more
actively struggle with bureaucracy and command-administrative
methods of work,'' election commission Chairman Vladimir Orlov told
Tass.
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the former Moscow party chief who waged an
anti-establishment campaign, won his race with more than 89 percent
of the vote.
   Tass also indicated that party officials met in Leningrad on
Tuesday to review the results of the election, but no word was
available on the results of that meeting.
   The literary weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta reported that in at
least one case a party leader's loss may result in a court case.
The paper said the party leader of Alma Ata, capital of Kazakhstan,
was taking his opponent to court for distributing 100,000 leaflets
accusing him of selling deficit items like meat, perfume and sugar
at his election rallies.
   V.I. Romanov, the Alma Ata party leader, lost the election to A.
Safonov, the director of a home-building enterprise.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said two days
after the balloting that party organizations would have to review
the status of top officials who lost their races. He refused to
characterize the vote as a defeat for the party, saying the vast
majority of those elected were party members.
   Official figures released Tuesday indicated that 87.6 percent of
those elected on March 26 were party members.
   Orlov told Tass that nationwide voter turnout was 89.8 percent.
   ``That high degree of activity gladdens us more than the
notorious 99.9 percent participation which we were proud of
earlier,'' Orlov said. ``In this election there was no race for
percentage of participation, the previous mandatory measures
practiced previously were fully excluded.''
   In the past, the Soviet Union proclaimed an almost total
participation in elections as proof of citizens' satisfaction, even
though voters weren't offered a choice.
   Tass said runoff elections will be held in another 76 districts
Sunday for seats in which the vote was split among three or more
candidates such that no one received a majority.
   One-third of the new congress will consist of deputies elected
by the party and its affiliates, labor, professional and social
organizations.
   Tass said 18 of those 750 seats remain to be filled. They
include 12 seats from the Academy of Sciences, where scientists
rejected most of an old guard list that did not include human
rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov.
   Sakharov has been nominated again as a candidate and the academy
is to decide later this week when a new election will be held.
   The final figures indicated that of those elected, 17.1 percent
were women and 18.6 percent were workers. Both figures were lower
than the composition of the present Supreme Soviet, in which
authorities have tried to impose quotas.

<TEXT>
   President Bush promised Tuesday to make active
use of his veto powers and suggested a minimum wage bill now before
Congress may be the first candidate.
   ``Let the Congress not misunderstand my determination,'' Bush
told a business group. He insisted he would not budge from his
proposal for raising the current $3.35 hourly minimum wage to
$4.25, with a 60-day sub-minimum ``training wage'' for youths.
   ``I've got to hold the line. I've got to hold the line on the
grounds of economics (and) on the grounds of making people
understand I was serious about that being the best offer,'' he said
during a question-and-answer session with members of the American
Business Conference.
   The House has passed legislation to raise the minimum wage to
$4.55 by October 1991, with a sub-minimum wage starting at $3.35 to
be paid for 60 days but only for a person's first-ever job. A
pending Senate bill would raise the minimum wage to $4.65 in
January 1992, and currently has no sub-minimum provision.
   Bush's measure would raise the minimum wage to $4.25 by January
1992.
   ``This is our best shot,'' Bush said. ``I respect and recognize
the positions of ... members of Congress on it. But I've got to
stay with this and I'm going to stay with this.''
   The president said he would not shy away from using the veto.
   ``There will be time when we have to say, look here's what I
believe, and then rally our (one) third to defend the president's
position.'' It takes a two-thirds vote of both chambers to override
a veto.
   On another subject, Bush _ who vowed ``no new taxes'' both
during his campaign and as president _ was asked if he could
support a value-added tax on products and services, something like
a national sales tax.
   ``I don't even want to discuss a tax on consumerism,'' Bush
said. However, he said that given the hypothetical requirement to
choose between different kinds of taxes, a tax on consumption would
be philosophically preferable to one that would sap job creation.
   Meanwhile, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had set up
a new White House Council on business competitiveness and assigned
Vice President Dan Quayle to head it.
   Bush had promised to do so in his Feb. 9 budget speech to
Congress.
   Members of the council will include Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, budget director Richard Darman, White House chief
of staff John Sununu and Michael Boskin, chairman of the
President's Council of Economic Advisers.
   Quayle already is chairman of the National Space Council, an
Eisenhower-era body Bush has reconstructed to explore and promote
the nation's space program.
   As part of its mission to improve U.S. business competitiveness,
the new council will examine, among other things, government
regulation and paperwork burdens, Fitzwater said.
   He said, however, that it would ``not be a decision-making
body'' and the panel would instead focus on ``the larger questions
that bear on competitiveness.''
   ``They will determine their own duration and the nature of their
work,'' the spokesman said, ``so the vice president will give form
and substance to this group.''

   Irina Moore, 82, widow of sculptor Henry Moore,
died at her home in Much Hadham near Cambridge on Tuesday, her
attorneys said.
   Attorneys Goodman Derrick and Co. did not disclose the cause of
death.
   Irina Radetzky, a Russian emigre born in Kiev, was an art
student when she met Moore in 1928. They married the following year
and are survived by their only child, Mary, born in 1946, and three
grandchildren.
   Moore was regarded as the greatest living sculptor when he died
at age 88 on Aug. 31, 1986, at the village of Much Hadham, where
the couple had lived since 1948.
   He left instructions that none of his unfinished works should be
completed, except for finishing touches and then only with his
wife's permission.

   A group of students took over the Morris Brown
College administration building on Tuesday in a protest over
conditions in classrooms, dormitories and the cafeteria.
   Hundreds of other students demonstrated outside, while city
police and campus security guards stood nearby. No arrests were
made, and no confrontations were reported.
   ``This is not an irrational temper tantrum,'' said Antoine
Chancellor, a Morris Brown freshman from San Jose, Calif., who was
among the leaders of the demonstration. ``We have filled out the
papers. We have gone through the process. The process has failed.''
   It was unclear how many students were in the building. Protest
organizers refused to say how many were involved in the siege, and
the curtains were drawn over the windows.
   Occasionally, hands could be seen placing signs in the windows.
One poster had a drawing of a clenched fist and the words:
``Student Power.''
   Students who gathered on a lawn at the campus south of downtown
Atlanta heard a taped message outlining a series of grievances
against the administration of the predominantly black college.
   The students cheered as the unidentified speaker on the tape
criticized the college's security system, cafeteria, health
services, dormitory conditions and what students feel is a lack of
black studies in the curriculum.
   Protesters also said the college was planning to expel about 150
students who were delinquent on tuition payments.
   Cynthia M. Bell, a spokeswoman for the college, which is part of
the Atlanta University Center, said administrators wanted to talk
with the students who took over the building. College President
Calvert H. Smith was out of town.
   Students also were angry that the school had refused to
compensate students for clothing and other possessions lost in a
blaze at a men's dormitory on Sunday. Ms. Bell said officials were
looking into the complaints.

   ABC's coverage of the 61st Academy Awards
captured half the TV audience and first place in the Nielsen
ratings for the week ended April 1.
   However, NBC handily won the week for the 41st straight time
despite the Oscar ceremony's 29.8 rating and 50 share, the highest
for the show since 1984. An estimated 75 million people watched all
or some of the presentation of the Oscars.
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' was in second place ahead of
third-place ``Roseanne,'' the new ABC comedy that had been first
for the past three weeks. NBC's ``Cheers,'' in fifth place, got its
highest rating of the season.
   NBC took five of the Top 10, including the Sunday Night Movie
presentation of ``The Hillside Stranglers,'' which was sixth. ABC
had three and CBS two.
   The A.C. Nielsen Co. said NBC won the week with a rating of
15.8, extending the network's record for its longest winning
streak. ABC was second with 14.4 and CBS was third with 12.4.
   For the season to date, NBC leads with 15.8, ABC is second with
12.9 and CBS is third with 12.7. Each ratings point represents
904,000 households with television. The share is a percentage of
sets in use.
   Here are the Top 10: 61st Annual Academy Awards, ABC; ``The
Cosby Show,'' NBC; ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``A Different World,'' NBC;
``Cheers,'' NBC; ``NBC Sunday Movie ``The Hillside Stranglers,''
NBC; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``The
Wonder Years,'' ABC; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS.
   The NBC drama ``Quantum Leap'' was in 55th place for its
premiere.
   ABC's ``Moonlighting,'' newly moved to Sunday with new episodes,
was in 70th place. It was the fourth lowest rated network show of
the week.
   The new ABC comedy ``Anything But Love'' finished in 19th place,
but has been steadily dropping in the ratings since its premiere.
It completes its six-week spring tryout next week and will be
replaced by ``Have Faith,'' a comedy about four Catholic priests in
a Chicago parish.
   Fox Broadcasting's ``Married ... With Children'' was its
highest-rated show, finishing in a three-way tie for 59th place.
Fox's ``America's Most Wanted'' was in 62nd place.
   The five lowest-ranked network shows were NBC's
``Nightingales,'' ABC's ``Moonlighting,'' ABC's HeartBeat,'' ABC's
``Great Circuses of the World'' and ABC's ``Men.''
   Among the news shows, ``The CBS Evening News'' was first with a
rating of 10.6. ABC was second with 10.4 and NBC was third with 9.4.

<HEAD>Beirut Bombarded For Fourth Day; Americans Evacuated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian gunners traded
shellfire across Beirut before dawn Tuesday, bombarding the city's
residential suburbs non-stop for the fourth day.
   A U.S. Embassy official said two American officers were
evacuated Monday. The officers were part of a three-man technical
team assigned to Lebanon's Defense Ministry.
   Ambassador John McCarthy told reporters after a meeting with
army commander Gen. Michel Aoun that, ``This fighting must stop
quickly. ... It has caused tremendous damage, killed many people
and brought Lebanon's economy to its knees.''
   McCarthy met Aoun at the bunker of the battered presidential
palace in suburban Baabda, five miles east of Beirut.
   Aoun heads the Christian military Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government. His 20,000 mostly Christian troops have been fighting
an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces in and around Beirut for the
past four weeks.
   Police said overnight clashes killed six people and wounded 18
in Moslem and Christian areas before shelling dwindled to sporadic
exchanges after daybreak. The shelling began Saturday.
   Two more civilians were killed and seven wounded when the
shelling intensified in the afteroon, said a police spokesman who
cannot be identified under standing rules.
   The latest casualties raised the toll to 155 people killed and
506 wounded since March 8, when the current round of hostilities
broke out between Aoun's Christian troops and the Syrian and Druse
Moslem fighters.
   Also Tuesday, Syrian soldiers allowed a convoy of four tanker
trucks to cross from north Lebanon into the Christian hinterland
northeast of Beirut to provide a power station with fuel oil.
   Mohammed Mawlawi, manager of the state oil refinery in the
northern town of Tripoli, said the tankers would bring 1,000 tons
of fuel oil for the station over the next four days.
   ``A total power failure would be disastrous to the whole of
Lebanon,'' Mawlawi said in a broadcast on the Moslem Voice of the
Nation radio.
   Supplies were allowed in after the electricity authority warned
its power station in Beirut's Christian Zouk suburb would run out
of fuel oil Saturday, triggering a power failure across most of
Lebanon.
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio said Christian army gunners
Monday set ablaze a Syrian army ammunition depot in the mountain
resort of Abadieh, east of Beirut.
   It said the depot ``contained lethal chemical materials which
forced the Syrian army to evacuate civilians from the Abadiyeh
area.'' The report could not be verified.
   Despite the relative lull that prevailed over Beirut and the
surrounding mountains from 5 a.m., civilians remained huddled in
basements and bomb shelters to avoid any sudden escalation of
hostilities.
   A dozen families sheltering in an apartment building basement in
the Christian Adonis district dispatched one man to a nearby bakery.
   ``This is the safest way. We will send one of us to buy food for
the whole building every day until a cease-fire is declared and
accepted by both sides,'' Antoine Shedyak, a mechanical engineer,
said by telephone.
   Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Ahmad Sabah, head of a
six-man Arab League mediation committee, was due in Damascus on
Tuesday to try to arrange a settlement of the confrontation.
   The leftist daily paper As-Safir, which reflects official Syrian
views, said Sabah would propose a two-month truce between Aoun and
his opponents to give the Arab League committee time to work out a
solution to Lebanon's six-month-old political crisis.
   Aoun has been insisting that Syria be a party to any cease-fire
accord with his 20,000 troops.
   The Syrians, with 40,000 troops in predominantly Moslem
terrritories of Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate, are the main power brokers in the country.
   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing
in their mandate by siding with the Moslems against the Christians
in the 14-year-old civil war.
   Officially, the Syrians deny their troops in Lebanon are
involved against Aoun's forces entrenched in the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.
   The political crisis erupted Sept. 22 when President Amin
Gemayel's 6-year term expired with parliament failing to elect a
successor. Gemayel appointed Aoun, a Maronite Catholic like
himself, head of an interim military cabinet to rule pending the
election of a new president.
   Syrian-backed Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment because it
violated a 45-year-old tradition of having a Sunni Moslem premier,
a Christian president and a Shiite Moslem parliament speaker. They
pledged allegiance to Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni who
governed under Gemayel.

<HEAD>Senate Panel's S&amp;L Proposal Wins Praise, Criticism from Adminstration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior administration official on Tuesday
praised the Senate Banking Committee's savings and loan proposal
for maintaining tough capital standards, but criticized it for
creating a loophole in the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law.
   The committee is meeting behind closed doors this week in
preparation for public bill-writing sessions next week. On Tuesday,
the panel began going over a series of changes to the
administration plan proposed by the staff of the committee
chairman, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   According to a committee document obtained by The Associated
Press, the Senate plan would deviate only slightly from the
administration's requirement that thrift owners invest more of
their own money, or capital, to back up the loans they make.
   The administration would prevent S&amp;Ls from expanding after June
1991 if they do not meet stricter capital standards. The Senate
proposal keeps the deadline, which S&amp;L lobbyists have been trying
to push back, but would permit some weak S&amp;Ls to grow modestly even
if they missed it.
   ``We would applaud the fact that ... they have resisted watering
down the capital standards,'' Assistant Treasury Secretary David W.
Mullins, one of the key architects of the administration's
proposal, said in a telephone interview.
   Of the proposed capital changes, he said, ``I don't see anything
that's grossly out of line.''
   However, he warned that the Senate proposal for raising $50
billion to close or sell failed S&amp;Ls ``fundamentally threatens the
Gramm-Rudman process'' by setting a precedent that could be used
again for other spending programs.
   The Bush administration has put togther a complex mechanism that
combines taxpayer and industry funds and keeps the $50 billion out
of the budget deficit by selling bonds through a quasi-government
agency.
   Riegle advocates including the spending in the budget deficit
and raising the money through the sale of regular Treasury bonds, a
method he says would save $4.5 billion over 30 years because
Treasury bonds carry a lower interest rate. Riegle would avoid
Gramm-Rudman's automatic spending cuts by raising all of the money
in the current fiscal year, now that the deficit target deadlines
have passed.
   The administration believes its scheme for evading Gramm-Rudman
can't be readily applied to other kinds of programs, while the
Riegle plan could be used every year to avoid deficit limits.
Mullins also warned that opposition to Riegle's proposal from
Gramm-Rudman advocates could delay passage of the entire S&amp;L
package.
   Groups representing commercial banks are particularly happy with
Senate amendments that would shift more power over S&amp;Ls to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., a commercial bank regulator.
   The administration wants to give the FDIC control over the S&amp;L
deposit insurance fund. The Senate plan would expand the agency's
power further by giving it control over accounting and capital
standards for S&amp;Ls and by making it the primary regulator of
state-chartered S&amp;Ls. That would leave the S&amp;L regulator, the
Federal Home Loan Bank System, with little power.
   Edward Yingling, executive director of government relations for
the American Bankers Association, said expanding the FDIC's control
over S&amp;Ls would ensure that S&amp;L standards did not become looser
than bank standards.
   Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent
Bankers of America, said he was pleased by the Senate change that
would give the FDIC chairman a set term. The administration wants
the president to have the power to dismiss the FDIC chairman at
will.
   ``We think Sen. Riegle has moved very much in the right
direction in terms of making the FDIC board considerly more
independent of the White House and Treasury Department. We think
that's a major plus,'' Guenther said.

<HEAD>Former Co-Worker Says He Took North's Words with `Grains of Salt'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 6 grafs at end with afternoon testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A former National Security Council staffer
testified Tuesday he took much of what Oliver North said with
``with four grains of salt'' and recalled making a Pinocchio-like
nose-growing gesture whe he read a letter to Congress that North
was drafting.
   Vincent Cannistraro said he felt that North, in his efforts to
help the Nicaraguan Contras, had crossed ``the line from
objectivity to advocacy.''
   Although he was called as a defense witness, Cannistraro's
testimony was peppered with critical references to North, who is on
trial on charges including withholding information from Congress in
connection with the Iran-Contra affair.
   Cannistraro jousted with prosecutor John Keker who tried in
cross examination to cast doubt on the witness' credibility,
suggesting more than once that he had lied.
   Keker asked whether North, formerly a Marine lieutenant colonel
attached to the staff of the NSC, had been considered trustworthy.
   ``I had considered Colonel North a trustworthy person but there
were occasions when myself and others had some questions about the
veracity about some of the things he told us,'' Cannistraro said.
   Keker asked whether he remembered testifying before a grand jury
that he took things North said with four grains of salt.
   ``Maybe three,'' said Cannistraro.
   Keker then read what the witness had told the grand jury:
   ``With Colonel North you never could be certain if what he was
telling was true or fantasy or deliberately meant to mislead. My
practice was to take everything with four grains of salt.''
   To that reading, Cannistraro responded: ``It was the way I came
to feel about him in the summer of 1986.''
   Cannistraro recalled a comment by a CIA official, ``that
whatever Ollie was doing he was bound to get us all in a lot of
trouble and he wanted to stay far away from him.''
   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan drew from the witness that he
admired North for ``his dedication and his persistence'' and would
want him ``in a foxhole with me when the first rounds were coming
in.''
   Keker asked about a time when North was drafting answers to
inquiries by two congressional committees. One of the charges
against North is that he made false statements in those letters,
which were signed by then-National Security Adviser Robert C.
McFarlane.
   ``He showed you some of his answers?'' Keker asked.
   ``I asked him if they were accurate and they did not appear to
be so,'' said Cannistraro.
   ``Did you do anything?'' said Keker. Cannistraro balked,
appealing to the judge on whether he had to answer. ``I want to
know what you did,'' Keker continued.
   ``I suggested ...'' Cannistraro began, and the prosecutor put
his hand to his nose and stretched his arm out, as if to show a
long nose.
   ``Not that long,'' said Cannistraro, and even North at the
witness table joined in the laughter.
   ``Whose nose grew?'' Keker asked.
   ``I was trying to convey to Colonel North his answer did not
reflect the facts,'' said Cannistraro. ``He said it was out of the
suggestion of Mr. McFarlane and he was not a free agent in the
matter.''
   McFarlane testified earlier in the trial that he was responsible
for the letters and that North contributed just two innocuous
paragraphs to one of the letters.
   Keker also brought out that Cannistraro had made no mention in
his 1987 grand jury appearance of his assertion Monday that
then-CIA Director William Casey said President Reagan had
designated North as the man who would assist the Contras if
Congress enacted a military aid ban.
   ``You know it's easy to blame things on a dead man,'' Keker told
the witness.
   ``Yes,'' responded Cannistraro.
   Under questioning from U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell,
Cannistraro said that Casey's comments were at a different meeting
from the one he discussed before the grand jury.
   Cannistraro said that at the time he was being ``intimidated''
by members of the special prosecuting team and that ``my agenda was
to try to be cooperative ... but ... avoid going into significant
detail when not asked.''
   ``I did not lie to the grand jury,'' Cannistraro said at one
point.
   In rapid succession, three more defense witnesses testified
Tuesday afternoon before the jury was sent home until Thursday. The
one-day recess was called because of a death in the family of a
juror.
   _Norman H. Gardner Jr., a CIA official, testified that he had
the job of drafting testimony that Casey was to give on Capitol
Hill on Nov. 21, 1986, after the diversion of Iran arms sales
profits to the Contras became known.
   Casey was in a Central American country, so the CIA arranged for
Gardner to be flown in an Air Force C-130 to take him the draft,
the witness said. He and an armed guard were alone with the crew on
the plane, which can carry more than 42,000 pounds of cargo.
   _William Charles Haskell, who owns a tax-preparation franchise,
told of being detailed by North to help with getting the land for
an air strip in Costa Rica. Haskell credited North with saving his
life when both were Marine platoon leaders in Vietnam.
   ``I saw an opportunity to help this country,'' he said. ``To
this day I think everything I did and everything Ollie did was
helpful to this country.''
   _Gaston Sigur, who was assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs at the State Department in March 1986,
said that at North's request he got North together with
representatives of Taiwan, South Korea and China. North told each
about the Contras' needs and eventually Taiwan contributed $2
million.

<HEAD>Powell Takes Charge Of Army's Largest Command</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, the former White House
security adviser, said Tuesday that despite turmoil in the Soviet
Union, that country's armed forces were strong and ready to fight.
   Powell was installed as head of the U.S. Army Forces Command and
said his job was to keep 1 million active, reserve and National
Guard troops in the United States ready for combat ``with the hope
they will never be needed.''
   ``The Soviets are going through wrenching historic change,
beginning with the irreversible acknowledgement that their system
is broken and has to be changed,'' Powell said at a ceremony at
Fort McPherson, the headquarters of the command, which is known as
FORSCOM.
   Despite the Soviets' internal turmoil, ``there is nothing wrong
with their deployed forces,'' he said. ``Their FORSCOM is strong.
We must be strong.''
   Powell said a priority was National Guard and reserve units,
which ``are not as ready as we would like them to be. We don't have
the resources.''
   Powell said he saw a role for the military in the war on drugs,
but cautioned against its use as a police force.
   ``I will not be resistant to finding ways for the military to
help civilian authorities in defense against a major threat,'' he
said. ``I think there are opportunities for our men to get good
training'' in interdiction.
   Powell cautioned that even an apparently innovative leader like
Mikhail Gorbachev would need time to make major changes in Soviet
life.
   ``It took them 70 years to acknowledge their system is not
working. They're not going to fix it in one or two years,'' he
said. ``It is the West that is strong. He has to be innovative. He
has to be imaginative.''
   Powell, who will be 52 Wednesday, succeeded Gen. Joseph T.
Palastra Jr., who had the post for three years and was retiring.
   Powell, who served in Korea and Vietnam, became President
Reagan's national security adviser in January 1987.
   Powell said the Army was in a higher state of readiness with a
better quality of soldier than at any time in his 31 years of
military service.
   In the old days, he said, soldiers would keep a pinball machine
in a corner of their barracks. ``Today there's a computer there.''

<HEAD>Pilot of Chased Plane Bails Out Before Aircraft Crashes</HEAD>

   A suspected marijuana smuggler being chased by
federal agents bailed out of his aircraft, prompting NORAD to
launch an Air Force F-16 to shoot down the pilotless plane,
officials said Tuesday.
   But the sophisticated military jet wasn't needed when the
twin-engine Beechcraft crashed into the Gulf of Mexico about 190
miles west of Naples on Monday night, after five aircraft joined
the chase.
   Footage of the plane slamming into the sea was filmed from a
U.S. Customs Service chase plane.
   Ronald Arthur Coxe, 42, a commercial pilot from Miami, set his
Beechcraft Travelair on automatic pilot and _ making his first jump
_ parachuted over Highlands County in south-central Florida, said
Coast Guard Petty Officer Luis Diaz.
   ``He said he almost took his head off. He was upside down and
the cables were around his neck when he pulled the cord,'' Diaz
said.
   In custody later, Coxe said a companion he refused to identify
had bailed out before him.
   ``We don't know anything about a second person,'' said Customs
spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   A Coast Guard Blackhawk helicopter in pursuit of the Beechcraft
saw Coxe swing a U-turn and bail out over land just north of Lake
Josephine, Sheehan said.
   ``They saw a large object with a parachute leave the plane,'' he
said, adding that agents weren't certain at first what went out the
door at 7,500 feet. They landed and took Coxe into custody.
   Coxe, charged with smuggling marijuana by aircraft, was taken
before a magistrate Tuesday and ordered held without bond pending
another hearing Friday.
   A Coast Guard radar plane spotted a small plane flying
suspiciously low at about 200 feet over the water 150 miles
southwest of Key West on Monday afternoon, Sheehan said. The
helicopter and a Coast Guard Falcon jet took off after it.
   Three hours after the saga began, Customs contacted the North
American Air Defense Command requesting an F-16 to shoot down the
unmanned aircraft.
   The F-16 from the Florida Panhandle base tailed the Beechcraft
and was ready to shoot it down had it veered back toward land and
posed any danger to populated areas, said Coast Guard Lt.j.g. John
Katinski.
   The plane crashed after narrowly missing a Coast Guard
air-surveillance balloon tethered to a ship in the Gulf of Mexico,
authorities said.
   A Coast Guard cutter sped to the crash site and fished more than
600 pounds of marijuana from the wreckage, Sheehan said.
   ``We're asking for pretrial detention because this man is a
danger to the community,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney William Jung
told U.S. Magistrate Linnea Johnson. ``This man parachuted from a
plane over a populated area. The plane flew around and it was a
bomb that easily could have landed anywhere.''
   A passport seized from Coxe indicated he had left Belize on
Monday, Suarez said.

<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Council approved an
emergency anti-loitering bill Tuesday that would give the city's
police power to arrest people congregating in designated ``illegal
drug zones.''
   The bill, the latest move in the city's attempt to curb
drug-related violence, allows police to make arrests if those
gathering in a such a zone refuse to move on when asked to do so.
   The mayor has 10 days in which to sign the measure, which then
would be effective for 90 days. The police chief would be able to
designate a place with a history of drug activity over six months
as an illegal drug zone and to ban congregation in an area of 1,000
square feet for up to 120 hours.
   The areas, limited to public property such as sidewalks,
streets, and public-housing courtyards, would be clearly marked by
signs, barriers and police tape. The maximum penalty for loitering
would be $300 or 90 days in jail.
   ``The intent of the bill is to be able to disperse people,''
said Nadine Winter, a member of the council.
   ``We recognize that we will have to impede on the rights of
others in order for us to gain control of our community,'' said
H.R. Crawford, another council member.
   He said he feared residents of neighborhoods where drug sales
are rampant will be subject to arrest whnever they gather outdoors.
   ``These areas are non-air-conditioned public housing units. When
it gets hot, of course, people are going to come outside,'' he said.
   Council Chairman David Clarke assured Crawford the measure only
prohibits congregating if police have asked the people to move on.

<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos on Tuesday
denounced discrimination against prospective Asian-American college
students and said his department is exploring allegations of
admission bias at some schools.
   ``Our Office of Civil Rights has been examining these charges.
We've been looking at them very closely,'' Cavazos said at a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee hearing. ``That kind of discrimination
is... reprehensible, it's illegal. We will investigate all
complaints in these areas and follow up.''
   Cavazos said OCR also is doing compliance reviews based on press
reports and information from other sources. ``OCR will undertake
several compliance reviews this year just to look at this very
issue. We don't have to wait for a formal complaint,'' he said. He
did not say which schools would be targeted.
   A spokesman later said reviews prompted by questions about
discriination against Asian-Americans currently are in progress at
Harvard and the University of California at Los Angeles.
   Concern over admission policies biased against Asian-Americans
was raised by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, chairman of the
Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human services and
education.
   Harkin cited a Yale Law Journal article that discussed problems
at Brown University, OCR complaints against the University of
California at Berkeley and a California auditor-general's report
questioning Berkeley admission policies. He asked Cavazos whether
his department would be interested in starting a compliance review
at Berkeley.
   A Cavazos aide, deputy undersecretary Charles Kolb, told him it
would be up to OCR to follow up.
   Later, OCR spokesman Gary Curran said OCR had received four
individual complaints in the last two years about Berkeley, one of
which is still pending. He said no compliance review has been
undertaken because the university is ``involved in a
self-evaluation.''
   Curran cited the auditor-general report as well as a recent
faculty report noting Asians may be at a disadvantage in gaining
admission to the school. ``We are waiting to see what sort of
action they take'' in response to the reports, he said.
   Officials at Berkeley acknowledge that the law school has kept
separate waiting lists for Asians, blacks, Hispanics and native
Americans for a dozen years. They say the multiple lists are a way
for minorities to gain representation in the incoming class.
   Cavazos told Harkin that as a former college president, ``I know
that it is important to have a diverse student body. I certainly
favor greater opportunity for minority students. But discrimination
against students merely because they are Asian-American is illegal
and unacceptable.''

   Congress should require 90 percent reductions
in air pollution by nitrogen compounds, given off in power plant
emissions and motor vehicle exhausts, the American Lung Association
said Tuesday.
   Nitrogen oxides help form ozone, acid rain and the formation of
airborne particles that hamper visibility.
   Some of nitrogen oxide compounds also contribute to the global
warming embodied in the ``greenhouse effect'' theory while others
may be more damaging to health than previously believed, the
association said.
   ``Aggressive control of (nitrogen oxides) is necessary, feasible
and long overdue,'' said Peg Garland of the association, which
recommended reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by about 4 million
metric tons a year, from about 20 million metric tons now. To do
that would cost the economy about $3 per person per year, she said.
   Several technologies can reduce emissions; catalytic devices
used in West Germany and Japan are achieving 90 percent reductions.
   Nitrogen oxides, which result from any combustion, have long
been recognized as important pollutants. In recent years, however,
congressional attention has been largely focused on sulfur
compounds, which also form acid rain; on EPA policies for dealing
with the failure of many cities to meet ozone standards, and on
emissions of industrial chemicals.
   About half of all nitrogen oxides come from industrial fuel
combustion, mostly in power plants, while 40 percent come from
motor vehicle exhausts, according to estimates by the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   If nothing is done, power plant emissions are expected to double
in 30 years and total emissions to increase by 50 percent, the
association said.
   New power plants must meet strict emissions limits, with coal
plants achieving a 65 percent reduction from what their emissions
would otherwise be. There are no standards for plants built before
1971, however.
   The association said that new plants should be forced to reduce
emissions by 90 percent and old plants should be required to
install control equipment achieving 80 percent to 90 percent
reductions over the next decade.
   Current federal standards for auto exhausts in all states but
California result in about a 75 percent reduction in emissions from
an uncontrolled car. California, which has tougher standards of its
own, is tightening its standards to achieve a 90 percent reduction
by the 1991 model year.
   The association said that Congress, in its debates this year on
revising the Clean Air Act, should extend the new California auto
standard to the rest of the country.
   Almost 100 cities fail to meet federal ozone standards, and John
Holmes, chief researcher for the California Air Resources Board,
said the EPA's strategies for fighting ozone have lost
effectiveness by neglecting nitrogen oxides.
   For sustained ozone formation, both nitrogen oxides and
hydrocarbon vapors like unburned gasoline are necessary. In some
areas, reductions in nitrogen oxides can increase ozone, so the EPA
has stressed to states and cities that they should reduce
hydrocarbon emissions.
   John Bachmann, an EPA environmental engineer, said he believed
the agency's concerns were converging with Holmes'.
   ``If the numbers are high enough, there's no question he's
right,'' Bachmann said.
   Bruce Jordan of the office said the agency was requiring states
to consider nitrogen oxide reductions in revising their air
pollution control plans.
   Speaking for himself and not the agency, Bachman said a
requirement for a 90 percent emissions reduction in all cases would
be ``technically premature.''
   The agency's spokesman on air issues did not immediately return
a phone call.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Fire Ants Send 21,000 To Doctor Yearly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fire ant stings send at least 21,000 people a
year to doctors in 13 Southern states, a survey has found.
   The survey of physicians for the American Academy of Allergy and
Immunology also found that 413 people were treated for
life-threatening reactions to fire ant stings last year and that 32
died, most of them because they were hypersensitive to the ant's
poison.
   In most of those who died, the ant stings triggered an
anaphylactic or allergic response which caused the body's
respiratory system to shut down.
   ``People and physicians should take these stings seriously,''
said Robert Rhoades, a pediatrician at the Medical College of
Georgia.
   People who are allergic to other kinds of insect stings should
be especially cautious, said Rhoades, who heads a special panel
that monitors medical problems caused by fire ants.
   Fire ants arrived in Florida by boat from South America and have
been slowly moving northward and westward. Cold weather has
seemingly confined them to the Deep South.
   But recent studies have shown the ant is crossbreeding and that
the hybrid, which can withstand lower temperatures, may push its
range farther north into the north Georgia mountains and Tennessee.
   More than 2,000 physicians in 13 states, or about 10 percent of
those polled, responded to the allergy academy survey, indicating
they treat about 21,000 patients a year for fire ant stings. Most
of those stung were treated successfully with over-the-counter
antihistamines.

<HEAD>Greek and Turkish Cypriots Both Agree to Unstaff Tense Green Line
Posts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governments of the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot communities have agreed to withdraw their soldiers from
three tense observation points on the Green Line in Nicosia,
officials said Tuesday.
   Rauf Denktash, president of the breakaway Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, confirmed in an interview that his government had
fully agreed with the U.N. plan for the pullback.
   The agreement in principle marks the first time the Cypriot
government and the administration of the Turkish Republic have ever
concluded a military withdrawal agreement, said officials from both
communities.
   Greek Cypriot troops are only 10 yards from Turkish Cypriot
troops at some points in Nicosia.
   In 1988, a Turkish Cypriot and a Greek Cypriot were killed in
separate sniping attacks across the Green Line, as the unofficial
buffer zone dividing the two ethnic communities is known.
   Under the terms of the U.N. plan, both the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot forces will withdraw from the posts, but will not
necessarily have to dismantle their defense works, said a Turkish
Cypriot official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Cypriot Defense Minister Andreas Aloneftis said his government
has agreed to the U.N. plan. Both sides still have to sign formal
documents with the United Nations.
   If the plan succeeds, Denktash said, it would ``naturally'' lead
to further steps toward demilitarization, ``provided the U.N. is
between us. Our armed people must not see each other from different
points.''
   The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, known as UNFICYP, was
established in 1964. Since 1974, it has patrolled the Green Line in
an attempt to defuse hostilities. It has about 2,100 troops and 34
police monitors from nine nations.
   Denktash and Cypriot President George Vassiliou are in New York
for a third round of talks mediated by Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar on how to reconcile the Greek and Turkish
communities on Cyprus.
   Denktash said Tuesday he has little hope the talks will result
in progress toward reunifying the divided island.
   The East Mediterranean island has been unofficially partitioned
since the Greek government fomented a coup and Turkish troops moved
into the northern sector in 1974 to protect the Turkish minority
community.
   The coup failed, but about 30,000 Turkish troops remain and
about 50,000 Turks moved from the mainland to settle in northern
Cyprus.
   Vassiliou's government demands the removal of the Turkish troops
and settlers as part of the process of establishing a national
republic with two states with virtual autonomy in local affairs.
   Dentash's Turkish Cypriot community declared itself a nation in
1983, but has only been recognized by Turkey.
   The Turkish Republic covers about 37 percent of northern Cyprus,
and has 120,000 residents, mostly Moslems. They form about 18
percent of the entire population of the island.

   Five Alaskan sea otters rescued from the
oil-stained waters of Alaska's Prince William Sound were brought to
Sea World, where park employees worked Tuesday to help them recover.
   The otters were cleaned of oil at an animal rescue center in the
Alaskan port of Valdez but they need additional care and
rehabilitation, said Jim Antrim, a Sea World vice president and the
park's general curator.
   The sea mammals are among the victims of the nation's worst oil
spill, which occurred March 24 when an Exxon tanker ran aground on
a reef. Ten million gallons of oil spilled into the sound.
   Antrim said four of the otters were ``basically in stable
condition,'' while the prognosis is ``very guarded'' for the fifth.
   ``It's got a lower body temperature and it's not eating on its
own,'' Antrim said. ``It appears to be a bit dehydrated.''
   The otters arrived at Sea World late Monday night. They were
flown from Alaska to Los Angeles in a cargo plane and then taken by
truck to San Diego. Federal wildlife officials asked the park to
take in the otters.
   Though the animals have been scrubbed, they still are threatened.
   ``When the animls have been fouled with oil and cleaned, they've
lost their natural insulation,'' Antrim said. ``So they have to be
cared for and fed and observed for a period of time until their
natural body oils ... can make them waterproof again.''
   It will take a minimum of four to six weeks before the otters
can rebuild the natural insulation vital for survival in the frigid
ocean. They also may have poisoned themselves by ingesting oil
while preening.
   Sea World plans to release the otters into the wild upon their
recovery, but they might not be returned to Prince William Sound.

<TEXT>
   The Hatfield town clock can keep on
chiming at night despite a couple's lawsuit charging that it keeps
them awake, a judge ruled.
   Superior Court Judge John F. Murphy Jr. said, in rejecting a
request for a temporary injunction Monday, that silencing the clock
until trial ``will not best serve the public's interest.'' The
judge also said Richard and Pamela Carnall failed to show they
would suffer irreparable harm if the clock was allowed to continue
to toll the hours.
   The Carnalls, who moved to the little farming community of 3,200
people last summer when the 200-year-old clock was not working,
sued last month after selectmen declined to shut off the clock at
night.
   The couple contends the clock, located in the steeple of the
First Congregational Church about 50 feet from their home, booms
the hours at 75 decibels, 15 decibels louder than a vacuum cleaner
and 25 decibels above the level the Federal Aviation Administration
has set as the loudest people can sleep through.
   Murphy said in his decision that expert testimony would be
required at trial to determine decibel levels as well as the
mechanical feasibility of installing a timer to shut off the chimes
late at night.
   The Carnalls were away from home and could not be reached for
comment Tuesday. But their attorney, W. Michael Ryan, said he would
seek to bring the case to trial as quickly as possible.
   ``Most people are sympathetic to the Carnalls, even people who
want the bell to keep ringing,'' Ryan contended.

<TEXT>
   Chemical agents such as those applied in
response to the vast oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound are
of limited value in major spills but can be effective in dispersing
smaller slicks, according to a study published Tuesday.
   The study by a National Research Council panel of academic and
industry experts said use of dispersants generally is helpful in
ocean spills but more biological studies are needed to determine
how coastal habitats are affected by the chemicals.
   The research council is an independent adviser to the government
on scientific issues. Its study was conducted before last month's
spill of 10 million gallons of crude oil from the Exxon Valdez, the
largest in U.S. history.
   Dispersants are most effective when applied to oil within the
first five hours after a spill, the study said, adding that a day
or two of evaporation and weathering cause spilled oil to become
too thick to disperse with chemicals.
   Exxon's application of a dispersant called Corexit was delayed
for more than a day, first because the water was too cold and calm,
then because strong winds that created a better environment for the
dispersants hampered the aircraft used to spread the chemicals.
   ``Applying dispersants quickly is especially important because
effective alternatives do not exist for treating ocean oil
spills,'' the council report said.
   Dispersants usually are made of thick liquid detergent that is
mixed with a solvent that thins the detergent and makes it easier
to apply. The molecules of the dispersant attach themselves to the
oil, reducing the surface tension between the oil and the water.
This makes it easier for the oil to dissolve in the water.
   The report quoted James N. Butler of Harvard University,
chairman of the experts panel, as saying, ``The mandate is clear to
use chemical dispersants'' when oil must be dispersed before it
reaches shore.
   Once oil enters coastal habitats, the decision to use chemicals
is more difficult, the study said, since fish and shellfish can be
harmed.
   For years, chemical dispersants have been suspected by some of
causing more environmental harm than good. The research council
report said experts who studied a 1967 oil spill off Britain in
which thousands of tons of dispersants were used concluded that the
chemicals contributed to the deaths of local animals and plants.

   Israeli officials said they will release
hundreds of Palestinian prisoners on Wednesday and ease
restrictions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for the
Moslem holy month of Ramadan.
   The announcement on Tuesday came on the eve of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's visit to Washington.
   An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
an Israel television report that the detainees will be released
Wednesday, but did not elaborate. Israel TV said it was a good-will
gesture before Ramadan, which begins Friday.
   In the occupied lands, 10 Palestinians were reported shot and
wounded Tuesday in clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing
Palestinian protesters.
   In Tel Aviv, dozens of reserve soldiers and officers
demonstrated in front of the Defense Ministry, demanding that
Israel end military government in the occupied lands and that talks
between Israel and Palestinians begin at once.
   ``I did 72 days of reserve duty this year, most of them in a
battle against the children of the territories,'' one officer told
the rally. Participants told Israel TV the rally was not political
and they would not refuse service in the territories.
   Security forces meanwhile arrested members of a guerrilla cell
organized by the Fatah faction of PLO chief Yasser Arafat, the army
announced.
   It said the members, residents of the West Bank village of
Hajja, were responsible for 16 attacks that wounded 13 Israeli and
Palestinian civilians in 1986-87.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, police closed the main shopping street
for hours after stones were thrown at an Israeli bus, witnesses
said.
   During a meeting with Palestinian journalists, Brig. Gen. Arieh
Ramot, head of the military government in the Gaza Strip, said that
during Ramadan the government will reopen some closed mosques and
schools, according to journalists who attended the meeting.
   He said hundreds of prisoners will be freed but did not give a
specific number. More than 10,000 held in connection with the
Palestinian revolt.
   ``I gave orders and instructions to the army to keep away from
schools and mosques because I know how sensitive Ramadan is for
Moslems, and we have no intention of killing or wounding anyone in
the strip,'' Ramot told the journalists.
   The journalists, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ramot
made clear he still believed mosques and schools were centers of
incitement for the uprising.
   The West Bank military government also planned to ease
restrictions, said spokesman Olivier Rafowicz.
   ``We'll do whatever we can to keep things quiet,'' said
Rafowicz. ``We are hoping for a good and holy Ramadan.''
   Shamir arrived in New York on Tuesday to address American Jewish
leaders before meeting President Bush and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III in Washington.
   The U.S. leaders are expected to put pressure on Shamir to calm
the violence in the occupied territories, where the revolt against
Israeli occupation has led to the deaths of 419 Palestinians.
Eighteeen Israelis also have been killed.
   Ramadan, the most important holiday for Moslems, marks the
period when the Prophet Mohammed began receiving the Koran, or
Moslem holy book, from God.
   One of Islam's ``five pillars,'' or guiding principles, is that
every Moslem must fast from sunrise to sunset during the entire
month.
   It is also a month of religious fervor when confrontations with
soldiers could boil over into violence. More than 80 percent of the
1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are Moslem.
   Rafowicz said steps planned in the West Bank would be announced
later in the week. All schools in the West Bank have been closed
for most of the 16-month revolt.

   Public comments are being sought on how the

   One of the biggest decisions will be how much land farmers will
be required to take from production under the acreage reduction
program, or ARP, for the 1990 crop. The idling requirement for 1989
was 10 percent of a farmer's wheat acreage base.
   The department said a decision will be announced no later than
June 1. By law, if the U.S. stockpile of wheat is estimated to be
less than one billion bushels at the end of the current marketing
year on May 31, the following year's ARP cannot exceed 20 percent.
   Department analysts are currently forecasting the wheat
stockpile left over at the end of this marketing year at 534
million bushels.

<HEAD>That Cactus Might Be a Guardsman Gathering Intelligence on Drug Trafficking</HEAD>

   The next cactus you see some night along the
U.S.-Mexico border in Texas just might be a National Guardsman
gathering intelligence information on drug trafficking.
   National Guard troops will try to infiltrate areas of suspected
drug smuggling along the border and relay intelligence to federal
authorities under a $2.9 million program to fight narcotics
trafficking in Texas, Sen. Phil Gramm said Tuesday.
   The Texas Republican said the Guard is not disclosing many
details of the planned foot patrols, part of a drug-trafficking
package of actions including aerial surveillance and helping the
U.S. Customs Service with search and seizure of cargo crossing the
border.
   A congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Texas Guard troops would use camouflage paint to ``look like a
cactus bush'' and then infiltrate along the border ``under cover of
darkness.''
   The $2.9 million was approved last week by Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney, who also authorized plans involving guardsmen in other
states.
   Gramm said a so-called ``long-range reconnaissance patrol''
program ``is a new program the National Guard is not talking
about.''
   However, he said it involves troops who will provide additional
assistance to federal agencies in a ``running war with
drug-smugglers along our border.''
   ``The American people clearly want the military more involved in
our war on drugs,'' Gramm said in an interview. ``It is a great
step ... to enhance our ability to interdict drugs coming into our
country.''
   But Lt. Col. Ed Komandosky, spokesman for the National Guard in
Texas, said he was not aware of any such foot or air patrols under
the $2.9 million effort.
   ``The only money we've been allocated by the Department of
Defense for drug interdiction is to run a cooperative program with
the Customs Service,'' Komandosky said.
   Under that plan, some 90 to 100 volunteer, part-time guardsmen
would be sent beginning Thursday to four border points of entry and
the Port of Houston to assist customs inspectors searching for
illegal drug shipments.
   Komandosky said he was ``positive'' the money would not be
financing the air or ground patrols, unless Gramm ``knows something
I don't know and that's entirely possible (that) I'm not aware of
any such animal.''

   Catalina Vasquez Villalpando is about to
become one of the most widely publicized names in America _ if you
look at the fine print on paper money.
   She was picked by President Bush on Tuesday as the next
treasurer of the United States. That entitles her to put her
signature on all paper bills printed by the Treasury.
   Ms. Villalpando, a Texan now working in Washington for a
communications company, is also chairman of the Republican National
Hispanic Assembly.
   If confirmed by the Senate, she will succeed another woman of
Hispanic ancestry, Katherine Davalos Ortega.
   The president, filling out his economic team, also said he will
nominate Richard Schmalensee to the three-member Council of
Economic Advisers, which is led by chairman Michael Boskin.
   Schmalensee, who once served as a junior economist on the CEA,
has been a professor of economics and management at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 1967. He would succeed
Thomas Gale Moore.
   Also Tuesday, Bush announced he had selected Delos Cy Jamison, a
House committee staff adviser, to serve as the new director of the
Bureau of Land Management.
   Jamison, 40, has been since 1985 a legislative adviser to the
national parks and public lands subcommittee of the House Interior
and Insular Affairs Committee.
   Previously, he was field director for Rep. Ron Marlenee of
Montana, and House liaison for the Interior Department, and a
Republican consultant on the Interior and Insular Affairs
subcommittee on oversight and investigations.

   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. was sharply questioned
Tuesday by a Senate panel over his failure to provide specific
plans to curb the record homicide rate in the nation's capital.
   ``We are here in the capacity of private citizens _ outraged
private citizens _ as well as public officials,'' Sen. Wyche
Fowler, D-Ga., told Barry at a hearing on the crime problem held by
the Senate District of Columbia Appropriations subcommittee.
   ``In all this testimony we have not had a single request saying,
... `We have a war on our hands and we need your help','' Fowler
said.
   ``Mr. Mayor, I think you're hearing something fundamental
here...ask us for the help, and specify what we are to do,'' said
subcommittee chairman Brock Adams, D-Wash. ``We've got to take the
streets back.''
   The hearing was held as Washington's drug-related murder spree
continued to place the district in the international limelight.
   Through Tuesday, 128 people had been killed in the district,
compared with 83 at the same point last year. A record 372 were
killed in the district last year, and police blame 60 percent of
those killings on drugs.
   Adams said he would recommend that more federal money be used to
hire additional city police officers, but only once Barry provided
him more details on current police anti-drug efforts, jail crowding
problems, and anti-drug efforts.
   ``We want to provide the funding, but we need a basis on which
to proceed,'' Adams said.
   ``Give us a couple of says and we can give (you) a good
short-term list,'' Barry told the Senate panel. ``This government
has no problem asking for help, and I hope I didn't give that
impression.''
   Barry repeatedly stressed that he held back on giving the Senate
panel details because he wanted to allow Bush administration drug
policy coordinator William J. Bennett to review a $102 million
proposal Barry had sent him Monday.
   During the hearing, the mayor agreed to make public his Bennett
proposal, but that move did not satisfy all on the panel.
   Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., who described Barry's written
testimony as ``a Chamber of Commerce document,'' accused the mayor
of glossing over the city's problems.
   ``If I were to judge you on the job you're doing with drugs, and
I were given a vote, I wouldn't vote for you,'' Kerrey said
angrily. ``In the absence of a community committed to solving the
problem, no amount of money would help.''
   Barry told Kerrey that his oral remarks, which Kerry missed
because he was at another hearing, went to the heart of the city's
drug crisis. Barry later acknowledged making a ``tactical error''
by not sharing with the subcommittee the plan he sent to Bennett.
   An aide to Bennett said the Bush administration probably will
not provide all of the $102 million aid package the mayor has
requested. Most of the money would be used to house district
prisoners in federal jails and for the hiring of 700 additional
police officers.
   ``It's hard to see how we could recommend an additional $100
million a year for the district,'' said Bennett spokesman Don
Hamilton.
   Bennett's office has not yet come up with its own total. ``I
don't have a ballpark dollar figure at all,'' Hamilton said.
   Stressing that his office had had the Barry plan ``less than 24
hours,'' Hamilton said it will be reviewed to see how it might
agree with plans being developed by Bennett's staff.
   ``It's clear that we agree on some of the things'' such as the
need for more prison space, he said.
   The comments of Adams, Fowler and others indicate growing
congressional concern about the district government's ability to
slow the record murder rate in the nation's capital.
   Two weeks ago, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., raised the
possibility of a federal takeover of the police department. Rep.
Stan Parris, R-Va., is drafting legislation in the House that would
do just that.
   An aide to Parris said his bill would be introduced by next week.

<HEAD>Father Of Four Slain, Police Officer Shot, Bomb Defused</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The IRA said it shot and
wounded a part-time police officer after one of its members was
killed in bed on Tuesday while his 3-month-old daughter slept in a
crib beside him.
   IRA member Gerard Casey, 29, a father of four children, was the
26th victim of sectarian strife to die in Northern Ireland this
year and the 2,737th to die in nearly 20 years of religious
violence in the British province.
   Casey was shot by two men who stormed his home in Balleymoney,
40 miles northwest of Belfast. Police said Protestant
paramilitaries were responsible for the attack. The IRA, in
messages to Belfast media, said Casey was a member of its North
Antrim brigade.
   Later Tuesday, a part-time police officer who had stopped his
car at a pedestrian crossing in west Belfast was shot and wounded
by men firing from the sidewalk, police said. The IRA said it
carried out the attack.
   The police officer, who was not identified, was in stable
condition with wounds to his back, police said.
   In a third incident, police said security forces found and
defused a bomb in a Belfast house after a two-day search after the
IRA said it had abandoned a bomb in the area.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in the
province and unite it with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish
Republic. Most Protestants want Northern Ireland to remain under
the British flag.
   In another development Tuesday, a court heard how the last
moments in the lives of two British soldiers slain by the IRA at a
funeral in west Belfast were filmed by an army helicopter hovering
helplessly above.
   Henry Maguire, 29, and Alexander Murphy, 31, pleaded innocent to
the murders on the first day of their trial at Belfast Crown Court,
which is expected to last six weeks.
   Twenty-seven more people, three of them accused of murder, have
been charged in the case and will be tried later.
   Prosecutor Ronald Appleton said the helicopter crew saw
Corporals Derek Wood, 24, and David Howes, 23, drive into the
funeral procession for a slain member of the IRA.
   He said their car was surrounded and the two soldiers dragged
out, beaten, kicked, stripped almost naked, driven in a black taxi
to an empty lot and thrown over a 9-foot wall.
   A man seen getting a gun nearby returned to the soldiers and
stretched out his arm in a firing position first over one and then
the other, Appleton said. Afterwards, the crowd dispersed.
   He said Wood was later found to have been shot six times and
stabbed four times. Howes was shot five times.
   Appleton said Maguire and Murphy had bloodstains on their
clothes of the same types as the two soldiers when they were
arrested in a taxi near the spot where the soldiers' car was
stopped.
   The helicopter had been monitoring the funeral procession on
March 19 last year of IRA member Kevin Brady.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government bowed to pressure
from mutinous soldiers and said Tuesday it released from jail and
deported three army officers who tried to overthrow Haitian leader
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   Rebels surrendered control of the international airport, which
reopened Tuesday for the first time since Sunday's coup attempt.
   The U.S. Embassy said there no longer appeared to be any active
resistance in the army to the government.
   ``I think there's no doubt that President Avril is completely in
control now,'' said embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde. ``There are no
signs of a continuation of the coup attempt against him.''
   A government communique identified the three alleged coup
conspirators as Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of the Leopards
Battalion; Col. Phillipe Biamby, commander of the Presidential
Guard; and Col. Leonce Qualo, an administrative officer at army
headquarters.
   The government accused Rebu, Biamby and Qualo of a ``foolhardy''
attempt to overthrow the government but said Avril had
``magnanimously'' decided to free them from arrest on humanitarian
grounds.
   The communique, read on state-run TV, said the three were given
safe passage to the United States and were driven Monday night to
the Dominican Republic border for a flight out. Rebu was
accompanied by his wife and four children.
   Independent Radio Haiti Inter said Tuesday the Leopard Battalion
had accepted their new commander, Col. Lionel Claude _ a strong
indication the insurgency had ended.
   In Santo Domingo, Foreign Ministry sources said the Haitians
crossed the border at dawn. It was not known how long they would
remain in the country before flying to the United States.
   Release of the coup leaders was seen mainly as an attempt to
appease soldiers of the elite, 300-man Leopard Battalion who were
demanding freedom for Rebu, their commander.
   At least four mutinous soldiers in the battalion were killed
Monday in skirmishes with troops loyal to Avril. The rebels briefly
seized control of national television station Monday before being
evicted by the Presidential Guard, and held the airport until late
Monday night.
   The airport was reopened Tuesday, but all commercial flights
into the country had been canceled earlier.
   Schools remained closed, but most stores in Port-au-Prince, the
capital, were opened by midday Tuesday and traffic was picking up
steadily.
   Avril, who assumed power six months ago in a coup led by
non-commissioned officers demanding democratic reforms, narrowly
escaped the attempt to topple his government. Loyal troops rescued
him Sunday as he was being led to the airport to be deported to the
Dominican Republic.
   Motives for the coup attempt remained unclear, and it was not
known whether Rebu, Biamby and Qualo were the only officers
involved.
   The state-run daily newspaper L'Union said Tuesday that Rebu was
the ``main ringleader,'' and said he and the other conspirators
were arrested and held under military guard at the National Palace.
   There was speculation the coup attempt was prompted by fears
that a crackdown by Avril on illegal drugs within the army might
lead to widespread dismissals of officers suspected of corruption.
Avril last week dismissed four high-ranking army officers accused
of drug trafficking.
   In Washington on Tuesday, the State Department denied giving the
Haitian government a list of officers it wanted cashiered from the
army because of alleged involvement in drug trafficking.
   ``No, we did not,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said when asked about the suggestion that the U.S. demand
led to the attempted coup.
   She said Richard Melton, a department envoy, had visited Haiti
and discussed with Avril ``the broad range of U.S. interests in
Haiti, which would include narcotic cooperation, along with
democratic reforms, respect for human rights and credible
development programs.''
   ``We did not deliver any list of names; nor did we give any kind
of ultimatum,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Radio Haiti Inter reported Tuesday that the army high command
had discharged five lieutenant colonels. Among them was Lt. Col.
Serge David, who has been linked in the past with brutal treatment
of dissident peasants.
   The report gave no explanation for the dismissals, and the
significance of the move was not immediately clear.
   Hubert De Ronceray, a Haiti opposition politician, said he
believed the coup attempt was financed by elements of the army
linked to the corrupt Duvalier dynasty and ``threatened to plunge
Haiti into chaos.''
   Another opposition leader, Rockefeller Guerre, said although
Avril appeared to be in control, the situation remained volatile.
   ``The affair is not over,'' he said. ``The contradictions in the
army still exist and may explode at any time.''

<TEXT>
   Dexter Scott King, younger son of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., on Tuesday officially became a leader in the civil
rights movement his father left behind exactly 21 years ago.
   King, 28, was installed as president of The King Center, a
policy center created in his father's memory, succeeding his
mother, Coretta Scott King.
   He will manage day-to-day operations while Mrs. King serves as
chief executive officer and spokeswoman for the center.
   ``After being charged, super-charged and turbo-charged, I hope I
can say I am in charge,'' King said.
   He used his first minutes as president to make an appeal for
money, saying building an endowment for the center is a top
priority.
   ``It's not about what Dexter wants,'' King said. ``It's about
what the King Center needs. Read my lips: money.
   ``The time has come. The generation before us has paved the
way.''
   Mrs. King, whose husband was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., on
April 4, 1968, said she felt ``a mother's pride'' in sharing the
center's leadership with her son.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had been scheduled to attend but was
grounded in Chicago because of bad weather, encouraged King via
telephone to maintain the ``rhythm and momentum'' of the civil
rights movement.
   ``Dexter, there'll be no cure in heavy moments,'' Jackson said.
``Your young leadership means so much to those of us who watched
you grow. ... Your energy and strength and work are what we need.''
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, said the SCLC is ready to work closely with
The King Center under Dexter King's leadership.
   Also attending was Zenani Mandela Dlamini, daughter of
imprisoned South African leader Nelson Mandela.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has selected
three experienced defense officials to become the secretaries of
the Army, Navy and Air Force, administration officials said Tuesday.
   The officials, who insisted upon anonymity, said Cheney
forwarded the names to the White House for President Bush's
approval within the past few days and expected their formal
nominations to be announced shortly.
   The sources said Cheney wants Assistant Defense Secretary
Richard L. Armitage to become the secretary of the Army; Navy Under
Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III to take over the top job with
that service, and Donald B. Rice of the think tank Rand Corp. to
head the Air Force.
   All three appointments will require Senate confirmation.
   Two weeks ago, sources first disclosed that Cheney had asked
Armitage to remain at the Defense Department as a service chief.
The 43-year-old Armitage is the assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs and had been slated to leave the
Pentagon for an executive position at the State Department.
   At Cheney's request, he agreed to give up the State Department
position and remain at the Pentagon. In his current job, he has
played a key role in overseeing American security assistance
programs around the world as well as counter-terrorism and Vietnam
POW-MIA issues.
   Armitage will replace John O. Marsh, who has held the position
since the first day of the Reagan administration and who had made
clear his desire to retire once a successor was picked.
   Garrett, 49, a former Navy officer, was an associate counsel to
former President Reagan from 1983 to 1986. He then moved to the
Pentagon as the department's general counsel and assumed the post
of under secretary, or No. 2 in the civilian heirarchy, in 1987.
   Garrett will replace William O. Ball, who took over the top job
for the last year of the Reagan administration. Ball was an
associate of former Texas Sen. John Tower and had been expected to
retain the post if Tower had been able to win Senate confirmation.
   With Tower's defeat in the Senate and Cheney's selection as his
replacement, Ball's prospects of remaining diminished.
   Rice, 49, is an engineer and economist who has been a cost
analyst at the Pentagon and White House Office of Management and
Budget. Since 1972, he has been chief executive at the Rand Corp.,
a major military think tank.
   Rice would take over the top civilian Air Force job from James
F. McGovern, the acting secretary. McGovern, another associate of
Tower, announced his intention to resign on March 24.

   A painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir of a man

million, a record auction price for the artist, Sotheby's reported.
   The price paid by London dealers Baskett and Day for the 1870
painting titled ``La Promenade'' was the seventh highest at auction
for any work of art. The previous Renoir record was $8.8 million
for his painting of a woman nursing her child, sold at Sotheby's in
New York last May, the auction house said.
   Only three works by Vincent van Gogh, two by Pablo Picasso and
one by Claude Monet have brought more at auction than ``La
Promenade.''
   It and 24 other paintings, drawings and sculpture by
impressionist and modern artists were sold by the pension fund of
British Rail for a more than $64 million.
   A sale of 70 impressionist and modern works afterward brought
the total for the night to $117 million.
   The Sotheby's auction followed a two-day sale of similar works
by Christie's that realized $55.2 million.

   South Africa said Tuesday the
4-day-old independence process in Namibia is in danger of
collapsing because of fierce fighting between security forces and
black nationalist guerrillas.
   Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha wrote U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cueller on Tuesday that South Africa was
considering suspending the implementation of independence in the
territory.
   ``Unless active and effective measures are taken within the next
few hours to stem the rapid deterioration of the situation, the
whole peace process in Namibia is in danger of collapse,'' said his
letter, released in South Africa.
   At least 169 guerrillas, 19 police and one South African soldier
have been killed since Saturday in clashes across Namibia's
northern border with Angola, according to police and military
officials.
   South Africa accused Sam Nujoma, leader of the South-West Africa
People's Organization, of sending 1,200 SWAPO guerrillas from
southern Angola into northern Namibia in a deliberate attempt to
sabotage the peace process.
   A U.N. investigation found the guerrillas had launched a ``major
incursion'' from Angola in violation of the peace plan, according
to diplomats in New York who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The United States on Tuesday urged SWAPO guerrillas to pull back
into Angola and allow the Namibian independence process to get
under way.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Washington
does not think the agreement was in danger of unraveling ``at this
point.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher also condemned what she
called a rebel incursion into Namibia and said the incursion caused
the fighting.
   Botha wrote, ``The South African government cannot be expected
to implement its undertakings ... while SWAPO continues to act in
flagrant violation of the provisions'' approved by the United
Nations.
   Under the U.N. plan, all SWAPO guerrillas are to remain at their
bases in Angola at least 100 miles north of Namibia's border until
mid-May.
   Botha said 4,450 SWAPO fighters now are south of that line. He
also said hundreds of Cuban troops in Angola, in tandem with SWAPO
fighters, had moved to within 650 yards of the Namibian border.
   ``In such circumstances, South Africa has the undoubted right to
suspend its compliance with its obligations,'' Botha's letter added.
   Fighting broke out Saturday, the day the United Nations began
supervising a yearlong independence plan for the territory that
South Africa has controlled for 74 years.
   South African military officials say the fighting is the
heaviest since the 1966 start of the bush war against SWAPO.
   South African Broadcasting Corp. television showed bodies of
more than a dozen guerrillas killed in one clash. Journalists
toured northern Namibia and saw evidence of heavy fighting, but
casualty figures could not be independently confirmed.
   Nujoma and other SWAPO officials say the guerrillas were in
Namibia for some time and that South African-led forces initiated
the fighting.
   ``Our people have been fighting inside Namibia in the past 20
years,'' Nujoma told reporters after meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe,
with representatives from the the five permanent member nations of
the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, Britain, France,
China and the Soviet Union.
   Nujoma said he planned to end two decades of exile and return to
Namibia ``very soon.'' He asked the United Nations to bolster its
cease-fire monitoring forces in northern Namibia.
   The United Nations authorized 4,650 troops for the Namibia
operation, but only about 1,000 have arrived and no more than 300
are in northern Namibia. The U.N. forces made no effort to
intervene in the fighting and say it is not part of their mandate.
   Perez de Cuellar said Monday in New York the fighting did not
mean U.N. peacekeeping efforts had broken down.
   The U.N.'s special representative to Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari,
traveled Tuesday from the capital of Windhoek to the war zone.
   The Namibian territorial police force, composed mostly of black
Namibians commanded by white South Africans, has done most of the
fighting against the guerrillas. The makeup of the territorial army
is similar. The South African army units in Namibia are virtually
all-white.
   About 1,500 South African and Namibian soldiers, belonging to
the territorial army and the South African army, were given U.N.
permission to leave their bases and support the police.
   ``Our people are being butchered under the United Nations
flag,'' SWAPO Foreign Secretary Theo-Ben Gurirab said Tuesday in
New York.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia, also known as South-West Africa,
since World War I, when it took control of the former German colony.
   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December when
South Africa, Angola and Cuba signed a peace accord that calls for
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops supporting Marxist Angola.
Besides granting Namibia independence, South Africa is to end
military aid to right-wing rebels in Angola.
   Under the U.N. plan, elections are to be held in Namibia in
November, leading to independence early next year.

   Students protesting government
austerity measures battled police Tuesday. Officials said one
demonstrator and a policeman were injured and 30 people were
arrested.
   Police reinforcements rushed to Catia, a Caracas suburb, when
hundreds of youths began burning tires after bus drivers refused to
give students a 50 percent fare discount authorized by a government
decree.
   A police spokesman said of the injured: ``The policeman was shot
in a leg with a projectile and the student sustained several
injuries from plastic shotgun pellets.''
   Students outside the Caracas Central University of Venezuela
later seized a bus and set it on fire. No casualties or arrests
were reported.
   In Maracaibo, 300 miles west of Caracas, most university and
public high school classes were suspended Tuesday, the day after
students burned a bus and a police truck. The Maracaibo protesters
also said bus drivers were not allowing the discount for students
and were charging them full fare.
   Demonstrations have been frequent since the government began
applying in February the provisions of an economic package approved
by the International Monetary Fund.
   Bus fares were increased, but the government earmarked $10
million to subsidize the 50 percent discount for students.
Transport companies said the reduced fares didn't cover their
expenses.
   More than 300 people were killed in riots that erupted Feb. 27
to protest price increases. Most of the deaths were in Caracas,
where about 3,000 stores were looted.
   President Carlos Andres Perez' Social Democratic administration
has continued to implement its ``economic adjustment plan'' based
on IMF guidelines that include the reduction or removal of many
government subsidies.
   Venezuela's inflation is expected to exceed 70 percent this year.

   Tranquilized caribou were loaded onto
a van Tuesday and carried north toward their new home in the
wilderness under a plan to restore the reindeer-like animal in
Maine.
   Six to eight caribou, some weighing as much as 250 pounds, were
to be taken to Baxter State Park, a 200,000-acre wilderness
preserve.
   After being shot with tranquilizer guns, the ungainly creatures
were lifted on canvas stretchers and carried onto a van for the
70-mile journey. Blindfolded to reduce stress, they were placed
side by side on a bed of straw.
   Scientists hope the animals will use their new home as a
breeding ground.
   Maine's once-abundant caribou were wiped out in Maine by
overhunting and disease. The last native woodland caribou to be
seen in Maine was spotted in 1908 on mile-high Mount Katahdin in
the park's southern end.
   Dr. Ladd Heldenbrand, a veterinarian monitoring the animals, was
optimistic about the animals' chances of flourishing in the wild.
The biggest threats to the caribou are parasites and predators,
Heldenbrand said.
   ``We hope the public is educated enough to leave them alone,''
he said. ``They're the public's animals. We hope they will respect
them.''
   Release of the 1- and 2-year-old caribou caps a two-year effort
begun in Canada.
   Biologists and state officials in 1986 had more than two dozen
rounded up in Newfoundland and trucked 1,200 miles to the
University of Maine. Calves born since then will be the nucleus of
the new herd.
   By Wednesday, officials hoped to have transported 14 of the
docile, tan animals to Baxter State Park, officials said.
   The animals will be fitted with radio collars so scientists can
keep track of them and determine whether they are being pursued by
coyotes and bears, said biologist Mark McCollough, director of the
privately funded project.

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honduras on Tuesday accused
Nicaragua of trying to use a regional peace effort to get rid of
the Contra rebels without giving up anything in return.
   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras told a news conference
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government refuses to talk to the
U.S.-backed rebels.
   ``Nicaragua doesn't want to solve the political and social
crisis in Central America,'' Contreras charged. ``It ... just wants
a bilateral accord with Honduras to fix the problem of the
Contras.''
   Between 10,000 and 11,000 Contra fighters and their families
began moving into Honduran base camps near the border with
Nicaragua last spring after U.S. military aid ended and a
cease-fire began.
   Nicaragua, which announced another of its monthly, unilateral
extensions of the cease-fire Tuesday, had no immediate comment on
the Honduran charges.
   Lopez Contreras said ``Nicaragua should offer internal political
conditions that permit the quick return of the Contras, their
families and more than 40,000 Nicaraguan refugees that have been in
Honduras since 1981.''
   Honduras wants the Contras ``to return to Nicaragua as quickly
as possible. But this is the responsibility of the Sandinistas, who
absolutely refuse to talk with the Contras,'' he said.
   In February, the presidents of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala,
El Salvador and Costa Rica agreed to come up with a plan by mid-May
for disarming the rebels and for their voluntary repatriation or
relocation. Nicaragua also agreed to hold free elections next year.
   The accord has bogged down over the timing of the repatriation
in relation to the elections. Nicaragua, which scheduled elections
for February 1990, wants the rebel force dismantled quickly.
   Lopez Contreras said the ``outlook for regional peace is very
gray and appears stalled. The signs are not good. The problem of
the Contras has not been resolved.''
   In Washington, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias acknowledged
intense arguments over timing and said the Contras should return at
the same time as the Sandinistas make democratic reforms.
   ``You cannot persuade the Contras to go back to Nicaragua ... if
you have nothing for them there,'' he told reporters after a
meeting with President Bush.
   Lopez Contreras said the Sandinistas ``stubbornly refuse'' to
talk with the Contras.
   He and his Central American counterparts ended a two-day meeting
last week without agreeing on demobilization of the Contras. They
also postponed the next summit from May 15, the deadline for coming
up with a plan to dismantle the Contras, to June 15.
   Lopez Contreras said implementing the presidential accord will
be ``difficult'' unless the Sandinistas agree to talk, directly or
indirectly, to the rebels.
   ``Lamentably, the problem has negative repercussions for the
entire region,'' he said. ``We hope the Sandinistas might meditate
on the future of Central America'' and change their attitude.

   Bomb experts conducted a controlled
explosion Tuesday night when a suspect package was found on a
flight from Northern Ireland, but the parcel was harmless, police
reported.
   ``When the package was examined, it contained a printed circuit
and a floppy disc for a computer _ nothing suspicious at all,'' a
Merseyside police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Liverpool's Speke Airport was evacuated and flights to the port
city in northwest England were diverted for three hours, he said.
   After passengers left the Manx Airlines shuttle from Belfast,
crew members noticed the package and alerted police because they
thought it looked suspicious, said airport manager Chris Preece.
   He said the Shorts 360 aircraft arrived via the Isle of Man and
Manx Airlines said it would return there for repair of minor damage
to the luggage rack.
   Preece said police knew the identity of the passenger involved.
   ``The passenger boarded the aircraft at Belfast,'' he said.
``His hand baggage had been taken through a security scan. It
passed through the scans and was safe.
   ``Each incident has to be treated seriously and checked out
thoroughly. We feel that the traveling public deserve to feel safe
these days. There must be no exceptions.''

<TEXT>
   The federal commission that recommended
shutting down 86 military bases and partly closing five more was
optimistic in its assessment that the move will save $5.6 billion
over 20 years, a congressional budget official said Tuesday.
   ``The commission's estimates of savings fell at the upper end of
the range suggested by our data,'' Robert F. Hale, assistant
director at the Congressional Budget Office, told a Senate
subcommittee. ``Unfortunately, missing historical data and
differences in definitions make comparisons of one-time costs and
savings unclear.''
   The commission did not include the cost of federal economic
assistance in estimating the plan's savings but did include the
expected revenues from sale of the land presently used by the
bases, Hale said.
   However, the office's analysis found that of the 33 bases closed
during the 1970s, the government only got 35 percent of the
fair-market value for sale of the land. In some cases, the property
was donated for educational use and other public services.
   The commission estimated savings of $694 million a year, with
20-year savings estimated at $5.6 billion.
   ``Based on the historic data, they were optimistic ... not
wildly so,'' Hale told the Senate Appropriations subcommittees on
defense and military construction.
   Lawmakers expressed concerns about the commission's
recommendations at two separate Senate hearings while acknowledging
the plan will likely go into effect next month and base closings
will begin in 1990.
   Congress can block the proposal, which former Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci approved in January, but the chances are unlikely.
The House Armed Services panel voted 43-4 last month to support the
commission's recommendations to close 86 facilities, partially
close five others and change the mission in 54 other installations.
The full House is expected to follow suit later this month.
   Nevertheless, legislators held hearings to question the planned
closing of some of their local bases.
   At the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on readiness,
sustainability and support, Chairman Alan Dixon, D-Ill., cited
recently unclassified transcripts of the commission's meetings in
which members discussed time constraints that prohibited a more
extensive examination of available data on each base.
   Dixon argued against the planned closing of Chanute Air Force
Base, near Champaign, Ill., and railed against the rating system
the commission used to make its decision.
   ``Who was the mother, father or brainchild of the rating
system,'' Dixon asked.
   ``A lot of people on the commission staff,'' responded Dr.
Hayden G. Bryan, executive director of the commission staff.
   Seated behind Bryan were 10 members of his staff and Dixon
called on each one to stand and give their name. The Illinois
senator also asked the staff members to write down their names and
addresses.
   ``The commission gave responsibility to faceless people,'' Dixon
said.
   In defense of the commission's decision, Bryan noted the base
closing was ``recommended by the Defense Department, chartered by
Congress.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 Justice Department attorneys
submitted a petition Tuesday to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
criticizing the department's attempt to persuade the Supreme Court
to overturn the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   ``We believe that every woman has the right to make her own
decision about whether or not to continue her pregnancy in
accordance with the guidelines set forth in Roe vs. Wade,'' the
petition said, referring to the 1973 case. ``We oppose any
governmental interference with this basic right.''
   The petition bearing 248 names, most of them attorneys, was
given to Thornburgh's office late in the afternoon, according to
one of the signers.
   Dave Runkel, a top aide to Thornburgh, said the petition ``won't
have any impact on the department's position.''
   ``These people come in six months after the decision was made to
appeal this case to the Supreme Court,'' he said. ``It's not
timely. ... If they wanted to have an impact on what the department
was doing on this, they're six months too late.''
   One of the signers, an attorney who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said the petition was submitted late because attorneys
at the department are very busy and it took a long time to get the
organization in motion. In addition, she said the signers hope the
petition will make an impact on other cases.
   She said Thornburgh and the department had involved themselves
in partisan politics by intervening in the case.
   Runkel said he didn't expect any retaliation against the people
who signed the petition, saying, ``The attorney general understands
this is a controversial issue that people disagree on.''
   ``I don't anticipate any impact ... unless people decide that
they so disagree that they can no longer work here,'' he said.
   The case before the Supreme Court is called Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services, and it concerns a Missouri law that
prohibits the use of public funds or public employees from
``encouraging'' or ``performing'' or ``assisting'' an abortion. The
8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected key portions of the law
last July 13.
   The Supreme Court could act on the Webster case without touching
the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, but the Justice Department, in a
brief filed in February, urged the court to overturn its earlier
ruling and leave decisions on abortions to legislators.
   The signer who commented on the petition said the majority of
those who signed are women.
   She said the many female attorneys at Justice give the issue
relevance, serving as reminders that their ability to pursue
careers would be compromised by unwanted pregnancies.
   Colleen O'Connor of the American Civil Liberties Union praised
the employees who signed the petition.
   ``Quite apart from the issue of what the department is doing on
Roe vs. Wade, it's heartening to know there are a few government
lawyers willing to exercise their First Amendment rights,'' she
said.
   ``The attorney general obviously can respond any way he wants to
that petition, but he of all people has to know that his employees
should not bear any recriminations for expressing their views on an
issue as important as this one,'' O'Connor said.

   Eighteen months after it was convicted of
selling bogus apple juice to consumers, the Beech-Nut Corp. has
been debarred from doing any business with the federal government
through 1991.
   The corporation, suspended from federal contracting since
December 1986, is now being debarred ``to protect the government's
interest in doing business only with contractors who conduct
business with honesty and integrity,'' the Pentagon's order states.
   The debarment, which Beech-Nut contested, was announced Tuesday
by the Defense Logistics Agency. The company was advised of the
decision in a letter dated March 3, the Pentagon added.
   A suspension is normally the first step toward a company either
being debarred or allowed to resume bidding on government work. A
contract debarment is the harshest administrative sanction the
Pentagon can impose on a contractor.
   Such an order, whose term can vary, prevents a company from
bidding on or receiving any new contract from any agency of the
federal government _ not just the Defense Department.
   In Beech-Nut's case, the Pentagon announced in January it was
changing the suspension of the Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp., a wholly
owned subsidiary, to a debarment. By taking the same action Tuesday
against the parent Beech-Nut Corp., the Pentagon has barred any and
all units of the corporation from receiving any government contract
``through Dec. 4, 1991.''
   The Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp. was convicted Nov. 13, 1987, in
federal court in New York on a total of 215 counts involving
charges of introducing adulterated food into commerce and violating
the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
   ``The criminal conduct of Beech-Nut Nutrition involved
manufacturing juice for babies which was labeled as and represented
to be pure apple juice, but in fact contained little, if any, apple
or fruit juice,'' the Pentagon noted in its order.
   The financial impact of Tuesday's action on the company appears
slight. The Defense Logistics Agency purchases Beech-Nut products
for resale in military commissaries around the world.
   Larry Wilson, a DLA spokesman, said he could not immediately
estimate the value of the government's business to the company
before it was suspended in 1986. Other Pentagon officials said,
however, the total was well below $1 million a year.
   Nonetheless, the company had strongly fought the debarment
action since being advised of the possibility last December,
arguing an entirely new management team had taken over and any
damage that had been incurred had been incurred by consumers and
not the federal government.
   ``The government bought the juice for resale to military members
and their families in commissaries,'' countered Gerald H. Werfel,
the DLA's special assistant for contracting integrity, in the
debarment order.
   ``The government paid for 100 percent pure apple juice, received
artificial juice, and government employees were offered the
artificial juice while assuming that the juice was 100 percent pure
applie juice. To say that the government was not damaged in these
circumstances is further evidence of Beech-Nut's continuing lack of
responsibility.''
   Werfel added the evidence was clearly sufficient to show that
``the Beech-Nut Corp. was and is responsible for the actions of
Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp., including its criminal activity from
December 1981 through March 1983.''
   Beech-Nut, which is headquartered in Fort Washington, Pa., said
it found the DLA's action ``inexplicable.''
   ``It is beyond question that our products today are authentic,
pure and safe,'' added a company spokesman, who asked not to be
named.
   ``This happened nearly six years ago, and stringent quality
control programs were put in place by the new management. We are
puzzled by this move and find it inexplicable that DLA is impugning
the current management by this action.''

   Namibian guerrilla chief Sam Nujoma
vowed Tuesday he would shortly return to his homeland, scene of the
bloodiest clashes between security forces and guerrillas in 23
years of war.
   His return would effectively end more than two decades as an
exile, wanted by the South African rulers of Namibia as a terrorist.
   But aides said it would not be his first visit home.
   ``He has been in and out with his men quite often,'' said one
official, who spoke on condition of not being identified.
   Nujoma addressed a news conference after he urged the U.N.
Security Council to immediately bolster its cease-fire monitoring
forces in Namibia.
   Asked if he would be going to Namibia, Nujoma replied, ``Yes,
very soon.''
   Nujoma reiterated denials that 1,200 of his men infiltrated
Namibia from Angola in violation of the cease-fire accord,
insisting ``our people have been fighting inside Namibia in the
past 20 years.''
   He said that in his 90-minute talks Tuesday with mission chiefs
of the five permament Security Council members _ America, the
Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ he expressed ``utter
disgust over the killing of innocent Namibians, some of whom were
celebrating the start of the cease-fire.''
   A cease-fire is the initial stage of an independence transition
period for Namibia, a onetime German colony ruled for the last 74
years by South Africa.
   Nujoma, head of the South-West Africa People's Organization,
said he urged the Security Council through the envoys to stop the
South African-led security forces ``from butchering Namibians and
confine the South African army to their barracks.''
   He described as ``full-scale war'' the fighting that first broke
out last Saturday, the day the cease-fire was to go into effect.
   The combat has killed 169 of his fighters, 19 police and one
South African soldier.
   Meeting with Nujoma were U.S. Charge d'Affaires Ed Fugat, who
heads the U.S. Embassy while appointment of a new ambassador is
awaited; British High Commissioner (ambassador) Ramsay Melhuish;
and ambassadors Arrkadi Gloukhou of the Soviet Union, Song Ghoqing
of China and Pierre Garriague-Guyonnaud of France.
   Nujoma, who directs SWAPO from exile in the Angolan capital of
Luanda, is expected to discuss the crisis this week with leaders of
the so-called Front-line states _ black African nations that border
on South Africa or are particularly concerned with events there.
   That regional bloc _ Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania,
Zambia and Zimbabwe _ spearheads African efforts to end South
Africa's policy of apartheid, or racial segregation. Front-line
leaders often expressed fears Pretoria would try to sabotage moves
towards Namibian independence.
   Nujoma is in Harare for a three-day meeting on Namibia of 150
legislators from the Association of West European Parliamentarians
against Apartheid.

<HEAD>California Panel To Issue Appeal Ruling On Spiro Agnew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state board is expected to rule later this
week whether former Vice President Spiro Agnew can get a refund on
his California taxes for money he had to pay to Maryland as
restitution in a kickback case.
   Agnew is appealing a 1986 denial by the California Franchise Tax
Board of his request for a refund of $24,197.
   Agnew, who pleaded no contest to corruption charges and resigned
as vice president in 1973, paid $142,000 in restitution for
allegedly accepting bribes from road engineering contractors while
he was governor of Maryland from 1967 to 1969.
   The former vice president views the court-ordered restitution as
an expenditure and wants to recover a percentage of it, said Louis
Bertane, senior counsel for the California Board of Equalization,
the appellate panel.
   The board's ruling will be issued Thursday, the attorney said.
   ``It's fairly routine. It doesn't present any extremely novel
legal questions,'' Bertane said Tuesday.
   Agnew originally sought the deduction on his 1981 tax return,
filed after he became a resident of Rancho Mirage and just months
after he made restitution.
   The Franchise Tax Board in 1986 rejected the deduction because
``California has never received any income, in the form of taxes or
otherwise, from the amounts (Agnew) allegedly received as bribes.''
   To approve the deduction, the board said, would have the effect
of requiring California taxpayers to subsidize Agnew's ``return of
public monies to the taxpayers of Maryland.''
   Agnew's lawyer, T. Rogers Harrison, urged the Board of
Equalization to ``ignore the identity of those involved.''

<TEXT>
   In the Soviet Union we know why the Cuban people rose to make
their revolution, what enabled them to repulse the armed
intervention, survive the economic blockade, cope with the
persistent and exhausting pressure of their imperialist neighbor.
The island of freedom was able to stand its ground thanks to its
proud and courageous people determined to fight for their
independence, for their right to live as they see fit. They were
able to do so because the revolution brought to the country's helm
a party committed to achieving lofty socialist ideals, ideals of
serving the people. And finally they were able to do this because
history had placed at their head one of the outstanding
revolutionaries of the 20th century, the legendary Comrade Fidel
Castro.

<NOTE>On Soviet-Cuban relations:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Our solidarity is not subject to fluctuations caused by the
considerations of the moment.
   Life does not mark time, time presents us with new requirements
and this applies particularly to economic links. They must be made
more dynamic, more effective, they must do more for both our
countries, our peoples. As for today, it is absolutely essential
that there be more strictness, discipline, so that undertakings
assumed be carried out in good time, and with proper standards.
   Today only those can count on success who are marching in step
with the times, who are drawing the necessary conclusions from the
changes resulting from the fact that the world has entered the era
of high technology, of intellectual labor, of the decisive role of
science. We are convinced that the potentialities included in

<NOTE>On internal Soviet politics:</NOTE>

   Why is it that in outer space we perform miracles and in
everyday life we are unable to meet the most pressing demands? Why
is it that our progress has grown slower, and how has it happened
that in our society there are phenomena alien to socialism, social
corrosion, apathy, selfishness?
   Even the present state of reform has shown what a positive
charge is inherent in these changes. This is most important of all.
... There is maximalism among some people, among valuable proposals
there are some that are controversial, some that are unacceptable.
This is understandable. It is due to our lack of experience,
poltical culture, but all that will come. We see how people are
straightening out their shoulders, how their social stature is
growing, how they are learning to solve problems in conditions of
democratization and glasnost.
   We do not regard our approaches and solutions as some universal
prescription for all. On the contrary, problems may be similar but
each party solves them in its own way, guided by its own notions
and the specific features of its country. From these diverse
unstereotyped approaches there emerges the international experience
of socialism which is helping us all to move forward more rapidly.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On foreign policy:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   As in the past the Soviet Union and Cuba have a common approach
to the key problems of international affairs. We are united in our
desire for a stable peace to avert the nuclear threat, to assert
the unconditional right of the nations to choosing their destiny,
to changing on a fair basis international economic relations.
   Of course the assertion of new thinking in the minds of the
world public is a complicated matter. Too strong are the traditions
and stereotypes and habits of the past. We see how hard it is to
digest for some of the Western leaders who time and again slip from
recognition of security to recurrency of the policy of strength, to
attempts to force their will on others.
   The most immediate task now is to solve so-called regional
conflicts. Analyzing their causes, it is easy to come to the
conclusion that they often emerge due to interference from the
outside and the striving to force order on others, that is attempts
to interfere with other people in their attempt to make their own
choice. We are resolutely against any theories and doctrines
justifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution, and all
forms of foreign interference in the affairs of sovereign nations.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Afghanistan:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, too, has been inclined to continue meddling
in Afghan affairs. True, those who believed that the Republic of
Afghanistan would be dismembered the next day after the Soviet
troops were withdrawn have begun to recognize that they failed to
take a realistic view of the strength and possibilities of the
Afghan regime.
   We in the Soviet Union believe that the Afghan conflict and the
way of settling it is a touchstone for all states, for the entire
world community. There are other regional conflicts, other regional
knots that have to be untangled and it's very important to diplay
responsibility and a constructive approach.

<NOTE>Angola:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   It is of basic importance that not only Angola's independence
has been defended, there also have appeared feasible prospects of
finding an end to the infamous legacy of the colonial period, the
enslavement of Namibia whose people will now be able to set up an
independent state of their own and join the equal family of African
nations. This is going to be a major victory for justic and common
sense in international affairs.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Middle East:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   That region ... has been turned into a storage place of much
inflammable material, but not only in the figurative sense.
   It would be unpardonable light-mindedness to assume that such a
state of affairs could exist indefinitely in the future. Getting
the Middle East knot untangled is in the direct interest not only
of direct parties in the conflict, the Arab nations and Israel, but
also Europe, the United States and of course the Soviet Union and
other socialist countries. That is why we believed and believe
still that it is necessary to step up efforts in the interests of a
Middle East settlement.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Nicaragua:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Of course the normalization of situation in that country should
in many respects depend on the positions of the United States and
other nations in Central America. We believe that Washington still
clings to its position of strength in tackling the situation in
Central America. We cannot agree with Washington's statements that
give a wrong picture of our relations with Cuba and Nicaragua. We
are for a central, regional settlement of the conflict in Nicaragua
on the basis of a dialogue of all parties concerned without any
outside interference and ensuring the rights of each of the peoples
to self-determination.
   We cannot agree with statement of Vice President Quayle which
tends to view the situation in Central America as in the backyard
of the United States.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Latin America:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Favoring greater cooperation with the countries of Latin
America, the Soviet Union is not looking for any political or
military and strategic benefits in the Western Hemisphere. We
believe that continent, like all others, should not be an arena for
conflict between East and West.
   The Soviet Union has no and does not intend to have naval, air
force or missile bases in Latin America, or deploy nuclear or other
weapons of mass destruction there.

   Budget talks between the Bush administration
and Congress resumed Tuesday with the chief House Democratic
negotiators saying he wanted a deal by Friday.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said the House next week will have
to move ahead with drafting a budget resolution on its own, if none
emerges from the budget talks. Congress has an April 15 deadline
for completing action on the fiscal 1990 budget.
   The budget talks, which have as their goal a bipartisan
agreement on how to reduce the deficit to $100 billion next year,
reconvened Tuesday after an Easter recess.
   ``I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement by this Friday,''
said Panetta, chairman of the House Budget Committee. ``We're
beginning to cut the differences.''
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., the chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said lawmakers were looking for some new proposals from
the administration.
   ``I think there are signs of flexibility on the part of the
administration,'' he said. ``But as of yet they have not made any
concrete counter-offers.''
   The talks were scheduled to continue Wednesday.

<HEAD>Paper Says Imelda Will Embalm Marcos for Display</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos says she will embalm
her husband's body when he dies and display it in Hawaii until she
can return and scatter his ashes to ``fertilize'' the Philippines,
a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   ``Not only will it be a political statement: It will be a
spectacle _ an international spectacle to have Marcos (lie is
state) here,'' she told BusinessWorld in an interview at the Marcos
home in Honolulu over the weekend.
   President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his family and several cronies
fled to Hawaii when a military-civilian uprising in February 1986
put Corazon Aquino in power.
   Marcos, 71, has been hospitalized in Honolulu since Jan. 15 with
heart and lung ailments. Hospital officials say he remains in
guarded condition.
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly rejected requests that the former
president be allowed to return. Cabinet Secretary Jose de Jesus
said in February the president and Cabinet had agreed, for security
reasons, that not even his body would be allowed into the country.
   The paper quoted Mrs. Marcos as saying: ``I'll keep Marcos here
until 1992, then I'll bring him home.'' President Aquino's term
ends in that year.
   In May, Marcos' mother died at age 95, and her body was embalmed
and put on display. Relatives say they are waiting to bury Josefa
Edralin-Marcos until the former president returns.
   Her body lies in state at the Marcos home in Batac, 240 miles
north of Manila. A mortician visits every two months to inject
embalming fluid and retouch the makeup on her face.
   Imelda Marcos was quoted as expressing optimism that Mrs.
Aquino's successor would let them return and fulfill a wish of her
husband to be cremated and have his ashes scattered ``to fertilize
his country.''
   She is more than 20 years younger than her husband and once was
groomed to succeed him, but the paper quoted her as saying she had
no intention of running for the presidency in 1992.
   ``I've seen it all,'' she said. ``I've had it all. Now all I
want is to be left alone.''
   The Marcoses have been indicted on racketeering charges by a New
York grand jury. Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent at her arraignment
last October but the former president's arraignment has been
postponed because of his health.
   They are accused of stealing more than $100 million of public
funds and using it to buy real estate in New York. The Aquino
government says the Marcoses and their associates plundered at
least $10 billion during his 20 years in power.

<TEXT>
   A Peruvian jetliner carrying 137 people
crashed and burst into flames as it landed at a jungle airport,
injuring 11 passengers and crew members, Faucett Airline reported
Tuesday. It said the others escaped unharmed.
   The privately owned airline said the Boeing 737 crashed at 6:43
p.m. Monday at the airport in Iquitos, 715 miles northeast of Lima,
during a heavy rainstorm.
   It said the craft skidded off the edge of the runway, a landing
gear and the right wing broke off and fire broke out. The pilot and
co-pilot were among the 11 injured, all of whom were Peruvians,
according to Faucett. It said most of the injuries were minor but
two people were hospitalized.
   The government's Andina news agency said earlier 130 people were
aboard the jet and 14 were injured, suffering second-degree burns
or hurt when they leaped to safety as flames engulfed the plane.
   It said some of the people jumped from the plane even before it
came to a halt.
   Andina's account gave a slightly different version of the
accident. It said the airliner tilted sideways when it was about
1,500 feet from the runway and one engine exploded in flames.
   The nose of the craft rammed into the runway and both wings tore
off as the plane skidded along the tarmac, according to Andina.
   It said the flames destroyed the fuselage, but Iquitos airport
officials reported the fire damage to the fuselage was minor. The
airport officials also said the fire broke out after the plane had
landed and went out of control.
   Andina said there had been no indications that the jetliner,
Flight 302 en route to Iquitos from Lima, had encountered earlier
difficulties.
   Airport officials blamed the crash on ``unfavorable climatic
conditions and strong tropical rains.''
   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman David Jimenez said the company had
not received any direct information on the crash. He said the
company and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board could
send observers for any investigation if invited by Peruvian
authorities.
   NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said in Washington the agency has not
received a request from Peru concerning the accident and would not
become involved unless invited to participate.
   In the last serious accident of a jetliner in Peru 12 people
were killed when an airliner of state-owned Aeroperu crashed on
takeoff in October in the city of Puno, 610 miles southeast of Lima.
   On March 10, eight American tourists and two crew members
perished when a British-made twin-engined plane crashed into a
two-story university building in a Lima suburb.

   Signs that once identified segregated
drinking fountains are still etched in the wall of the Jones County
Courthouse, but a supervisor said Tuesday he supports plastering
over them.
   Manuel Jones, NAACP county president, asked county supervisors
Monday that the signs be covered, saying they remind people of a
bygone era in the South when public buildings often had segregated
facilities and entrances.
   The signs were painted over some time in the past, but the words
``white'' and ``colored'' still can be made out.
   Supervisor Calvin Holifield said that he would support
plastering over the signs because ``obviously they are offensive to
some people.''
   Fellow supervisors Monday tabled Jones' request to cover the
signs, saying they want to consult with the Jones County Historical
Society.
   ``We've got so many problems in Jones County that we haven't
taken action on this,'' Holifield said. ``The courthouse is listed
on the National Register of Historic Places and when you touch
something like that you have to consult them.''
   Ellisville is the seat of the economically depressed, largely
rural county in the southern part of the state.
   The courthouse was built in 1907.
   Bill Thames, president of the Jones County Historical Society,
said the society had not considered the signs.
   Holifield, who has served on the board one year, said it was the
first time anyone had brought the markers to his attention.
   The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited segregation.

   Democrats were favored to hold an
Alabama congressional seat in a special election Tuesday that
amounted to a test run for Republicans hoping to gain ground in the
Deep South in 1990.
   Secretary of State Glen Browder, the Democratic nominee, faced a
lesser-known Republican foe, state Sen. John Rice of Opelika, in a
roughhouse, name-calling race for the 3rd Congressional District
seat.
   The seat was left vacant in December with the death of Rep. Bill
Nichols, a conservative Democrat from Sylacauga who held the mostly
rural, 13-county east Alabama district for 22 years.
   The district, which is about 75 percent white and dotted with
small towns, appeared ready-made for the GOP's plan to bring such
conservative-leaning Southern seats into the Republican House
column next year. President Bush captured over 60 percent of the
district's votes last November.
   But Democrats sought a second straight off-year special election
victory over Republicans.

<TEXT>
   Two weeks ago, Democrat Jill Long won an Indiana congressional
seat that once was held by Vice President Dan Quayle and was viewed
as a GOP stronghold. A third off-year congressional election will
be held April 26 in Wyoming to fill Defense Secretary Richard
Cheney's House seat.
   Browder, 46, a former political science professor at
Jacksonville State University, was strongly supported by blacks and
organized labor. He has a reputation as an election reform advocate
and was endorsed by all six daily newspapers that circulate in the
district. Browder is from Jacksonville, but lives outside the
district in Montgomery.
   Rice, 37, a real estate developer from Opelika who switched
parties last year after getting elected to the legislature as a
Democrat, pinned his hopes on a campaign strategy of relentlessly
labeling Browder as a liberal.
   Gov. Guy Hunt, Alabama's first Republican governor this century,
toured the district regularly on behalf of Rice.
   Browder ran television spots calling Rice a ``hand grenade'' who
had taken potentially explosive stands to cut federal aid to the
elderly in half while voting to raise his legislative salary by 50
percent.
   Browder also called Rice an ``off-the-wall radical.'' Rice
countered by calling Browder ``a wimp ... a liberal ... a liar.''
   Rice's campaign received heavy financial support from national
Republican Party organizations in the GOP bid to gain congressional
ground in the South.

   A band of thunderstorms whipped through the Southeast on
Tuesday, with tornadoes snapping trees and power lines in Georgia
and Alabama. A storm stalled over Colorado dropped more snow and
raised the risk of avalanches.
   In Haubstadt, Ind., divers searched two rain-swollen creeks for
the body of a 16-month-old toddler swept away after the family car
stalled on a flooded road. An Evansville woman was electrocuted by
a fallen power line.
   Tornadoes dipped across north Georgia Tuesday afternoon,
damaging homes and buildings, downing power lines and uprooting
trees. Power outages were widespread.
   A Georgia Power spokesman said approximately 26,000 customers
were without power.
   In Alabama, thunderstorms packing 70 mph wind ripped down trees
and knocked out electrical power to some 18,000 homes. State and
local police reported many homes with roof damage and some rural
roads closed by fallen trees.
   A tornado watch was posted Tuesday night over parts of Georgia,
North Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.
   In Colorado, advisories were posted for an additional 6 inches
of snow Tuesday and wind gusting to 40 mph across the northern and
central mountains. The storm has dumped more than 6 feet of snow
during the past week, increasing the avalanche danger.
   Breckenridge has reported 73 inches of snow during the past
seven days, while Copper Mountain reported 62 inches and Mary Jane
58 inches.
   Showers were scattered over central and southeast New England
into northeast New York.
   Rain continued along the northern Pacific Coast. Snowshowers
were scattered in Montana, Wyoming and Nebraska.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 2{ inches at Greenwood, Miss., and 1\ inches at Columbus,
Miss.
   The low temperature for the nation Tuesday morning was 7 degrees
below zero at Yellowstone, Wyo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 27
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 96 degrees at Long Beach,
Oceanside, Ontario and Thermal, Calif.
   In Los Angeles, a 79-year-old record fell Tuesday when the
temperature hit 100. Lifeguards scrambled for help as residents hit
the beaches for relief.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for showers and thunderstorms
from central Florida across eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey;
rainshowers from the remainder of Pennsylvania across the lower
Great Lakes, New England and much of lower Michigan, and rain from
northwest Montana across the northern Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 40s over the Great Lakes,
Minnesota, North Dakota and northeast Montana; in the 50s and 60s
from New England across much of the Virginias, the Ohio Valley, the
Tennessee Valley, northern portions of the states from Georgia
across Mississippi, from Iowa across Arkansas, over the remainder
of the northern and central Plains, Oklahoma, the Rockies, the
northern half of the Plateau, and the northern Pacific Coast; in
the 80s over the Florida Peninsula; with 80s and 90s from southern
New Mexico across the southern third of inland California; near 100
over the desert Southwest, and in the 70s over the rest of the
nation.

   Divers pulled a car from the Hatchie
River on Tuesday and recovered from it the body of an eighth victim
of a weekend bridge collapse that may have been caused by flood
damage.
   Four state inspection teams fanned out across western Tennessee
to check other bridges for weather damage.
   State Transportation Commissioner Jimmy Evans said heavy spring
floods after two years of drought probably contributed to the
collapse Saturday night by washing sandy soil away from the bridge
supports.
   ``We're trying to make sure there's nothing that we have
overlooked in this area,'' he said.
   The body found Tuesday in a gray compact station wagon was not
immediately identified.
   Seven other victims were recovered earlier.
   Crews searching the flooded river earlier in the day discovered
signs of a possible fifth vehicle lost when a 90-foot section of
the U.S. 51 bridge gave way.
   A dog trained to smell bodies buried in rubble or under water
pointed searchers to a section of the river adjacent to the
accident on Monday.
   The object's position was confirmed Tuesday by a boat crew using
a magnet, and a wrecker pulled the car out in the afternoon.
   Crews also set up a crane to lift away the concrete slabs
covering at least three other cars and a tractor-trailer.
   Workers had used jackhammers since the accident to break up the
three slabs into pieces small enough to be raised by the crane.
   State officials said the collapse about 50 miles north of
Memphis may have been caused by flood waters washing out the soil
around the bridge supports.
   The span that collapsed was 55 years old and carried two lanes
of northbound traffic. The adjacent bridge, which carried
southbound traffic, was not damaged but has been closed.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators worked against the clock to
resolve differences so the government and opposition can sign a
historic pact Wednesday to make Solidarity legal again and bring
free elections to communist Poland.
   Although last-minute agreements on trade unions and political
reforms were announced between Solidarity and authorities Tuesday
night, it was still uncertain if an overall pact would be signed
Wednesday.
   The opposition said an objection to Solidarity's wage indexing
plan by the official trade union organization, OPZZ, could undo the
entire deal on political and economic reforms after two months of
grueling bargaining.
   ``We are in a deep and serious impasse,'' said Solidarity
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
   He said Solidarity's National Executive Commission will meet in
Warsaw Wednesday morning to decide if Solidarity could sign the
accords without OPZZ's agreement on a formula for indexing pay to
the cost of living.
   ``Today we can only say that all possibilities are open,'' he
said when asked at a news conference if the free trade union
movement might sign a partial accord or refuse to sign any accord
at all.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, exhausted after a 10-hour
negotiating session, went home to Gdansk Tuesday. Spokesmen said he
would return to Warsaw in time for any signing ceremony.
   Negotiators reached a final agreement on trade unions Tuesday
that would restore Solidarity's legal status and reinstate people
fired for union activity after the December 1981 imposition of
martial law, Solidarity negotiator Jacek Merkel announced.
   A team on political reforms successfully concluded talks late
Tuesday night, PAP reported. The accord included bringing the
opposition into Parliament.
   PAP gave no details, but earlier Onyszkiewicz said Solidarity
won a concession that a two-thirds majority in the Sjem, or
parliament, would be required to override the new senate's veto of
parliamentary measures. Authorities had wanted a smaller majority
to be able to override the senate, which is expected to become a
bastion of the opposition.
   PAP also said the Politburo, the top Communist Party body led by
Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, met Tuesday to discuss
preparations for a final signing on Wednesday.
   It said the Council of State, also headed by Jaruzelski,
meanwhile reviewed proposed changes in the constititution before
they were sent to parliament.
   An extraordinary committee of the Sejm focused its discussions
on the proposed new senate and presidency, key elements of the
round-table agreements between authorities and Solidarity, the
agency reported.
   If a final agreement is signed Wednesday, parliament would meet
as early as Friday to enact the agreements into law, the government
has said.
   Monday would see the beginning of Poland's first open,
competitive election campaign since Communists consolidated power
after World War II, opposition sources said. The opposition
tentatively set two meetings this weekend to plan for the
elections. The Communist Party has scheduled a pre-election
conference May 4-5.
   Authorities proposed the round-table negotiations in August
during strikes that roughly coincided with the anniversary of
Solidarity's founding in the labor turmoil of 1980.
   Leaders of the official unions opposed Solidarity's indexing
formula to increase wages by 80 percent of the inflation rate. They
want payments of 100 percent of inflation regardless of a worker's
pay.
   Under the OPZZ formula, if the average cost of living went up by
50,000 zlotys in a given month, that sum would go to a worker
earning 50,000 as well as to one earning 150,000.
   Poland's annual inflation rate is more than 60 percent,
shortages of consumer goods are chronic and the foreign debt is $39
billion.
   A statement the official unions adopted Monday said the
Solidarity formula would ``not contribute to a cooling down of
unrest but can even lead to its aggravation.''
   Spokesman Franciszek Ciemny said in an interview Tuesday,
however, that the official unions wanted to work the problem out
and ``if the issue of indexation was to break up this table ...
something is wrong.''
   The government created OPZZ to replace Solidarity when the
independent union movement was banned in 1982 under martial law,
but the official alliance has taken an independent, militant
position in the talks.
   If Solidarity becomes legal again, OPZZ will lose its union
monopoly and have to compete for worker support.
   Negotiators reached a broad outline of agreement early in the
negotiations, which began Feb. 6.

   Relatives of the captain of the oil tanker
that spilled its load in Alaska told police he wanted to surrender
to face Alaskan charges but was awaiting advice from his attorney,
an official said Tuesday.
   Law enforcement authorities said they are not sure where Joseph
Hazelwood is, but a source who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the captain left Anchorage last week on a flight to New York.
Hazelwood lives in Huntington, on Long Island.
   ``We talked to his parents last night,'' said Lt. Thomas Fazio,
commander of the State Police on Long Island. ``They told us
something will probably be happening soon.''
   ``But they said it was up to the attorney to decide when and
where,'' he added.
   But after Long Island law enforcement authorities waited a
second day for Hazelwood to turn himself in, the Suffolk County
district attorney's office announced there would be no surrender on
Tuesday.
   A lawyer for Hazelwood talked with the district attorney on
Tuesday, said John Williams, a spokesman for Suffolk District
Attorney Patrick Henry.
   The attorney, who was not identified, gave no indication when a
surrender would take place, Williams said.
   Hazelwood, a 20-year veteran of Exxon, is accused of being drunk
when the supertanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef March 24 and
spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince
William Sound. He has been fired.
   Hazelwood's parents, Joseph and Margaret, who also live in
Huntington, told police they did not know where their son is.
   ``There was no deal cut,'' said Fazio. ``We told the family that
it would be better for him, down the road, to turn himself in
voluntarily.''
   If Hazelwood, 42, does not surrender within the next two days
police will actively pursue him, Fazio said.
   ``Right now if we see him on the streets, we will lock him up,''
said Fazio. ``We are anxious to bring him into custody.''
   The captain is charged with operating a ship while drunk,
reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. The charges,
all misdemeanors, carry up to two years and three months in prison
and a $10,000 fine.

<HEAD>Petition Calling For Amnesty Given To Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A petition calling for the release of China's
political prisoners and signed by 24,000 people was given to
China's legislature a week after it was seized by customs officers,
state media said Tuesday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said customs officials in
Tianjin forwarded the petition to the National People's Congress,
which closed its annual session Tuesday.
   The petition was seized last Tuesday from a group of Hong Kong
human rights activists who were attempting to bring it into China.
   A day later, the activists brought their case to the legislature
and requested that the petition be forwarded to the congress.
   Xinhua quoted a spokesman of the Tianjin customs office as
saying the request had been granted ``to respect the right of those
Hong Kong compatriots who took part in the signing to express their
views and suggestions.''
   The official said other materials seized, such as magazines and
pro-democracy periodicals, would not be released.
   The petition was signed by 24,163 people. Most of the
signatories were Chinese from Hong Kong and the West, but people
from 34 other countries also participated.
   The petition demanded specifically that China release Wei
Jingsheng, serving a 15-year sentence for ``counterrevolutionary''
crimes. Wei was arrested 10 years ago after he called for democracy.
   A growing number of intellectuals in Communist China are calling
for an amnesty for political prisoners. Since January,
intellectuals here have written four open letters urging an amnesty
and democratic change. So far, about 200 people have signed.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group,
estimates that Chinese jails hold thousands of prisoners jailed for
their beliefs. China has ruled out an amnesty and says it has no
political prisoners.
   The Xinhua report said customs officers seized the petition and
the periodicals under a law that prohibits people from bringing
items ``in excess of their personal use.''
   Members of the group said they believed the seizure of the
petition did not bode well for human rights in China and for the
future Chinese treatment of Hong Kong.
   Hong Kong, a British colony since the 19th century, returns to
China in 1997. China has guaranteed to keep Hong Kong's liberal
economic and political system in place for 50 years but many Hong
Kong intellectuals are skeptical.
   In a related development, students at Beijing University said
Tuesday authorities there are forbidding students from meeting to
discuss democracy and political change in China.
   A poster that appeared on a wall Monday urged the university to
``protect our rights of freedom of speech and association.'' By
Tuesday afternoon, it had been taken down.
   The poster, signed by more than 60 students, said democratic
change in China ``is not simply a matter of saying a few empty
words.''
   It urged the school to eliminate regulations prohibiting
meetings and to protect student groups from interference by
government officials.
   A school official said the university permitted students to take
part in activities ``as long as they were healthy and good for the
students.'' But, Yan Huajiang, a school spokesman, declined to
define what type of activities those included.
   He said the university would take measures to stop ``unhealthy''
activities. He declined to comment on the poster.
   According to the poster, since the autumn semester, students
have been meeting in ``democratic salons'' to discuss political
topics.
   But recently school officials and authorities from the Beijing
city government have broken up the meetings, it said.

   A woman who insists she is David
Letterman's wife was ruled incompetent to stand trial Tuesday on
charges of breaking into the talk show host's home.
   Superior Court Judge Harold H. Dean's ruling came after a state
psychiatrist testified that Margaret Ray is unable to assist in her
own defense.
   The judge committed Ray to a mental hospital in Newtown for up
to 18 months. She had been in prison under $5,000 bail since her
arrest in February.
   Ray, 36, is charged with burglary, larceny, criminal trespass
and drug offenses in connection with break-ins at Letterman's New
Canaan home on Feb. 24 and 28.
   Another judge found Ray incompetent in June after she was caught
driving Letterman's Porsche in New York City. Days later she was
found wandering around his home in the exclusive community 40 miles
north of New York City.
   Mark W. Ford, Letterman's attorney, has said Letterman does not
know Ray.

   President Andres Rodriguez said
Tuesday he will uphold human rights and civil liberties, including
freedom of expression.
   ``Dissent and criticism are no longer forbidden in Paraguay,''
said the 65-year-old provisional president and army commander who
toppled former President Alfredo Stroessner in a Feb. 3 coup.
   ``The crucial role of a serious and honest press should not only
be to secure democratic institutions but to project to the outside
world the truth, even if it contains imperfections,'' he said in a
speech to the Inter-American Press Association.
   In Brazil it was reported the United States has rejected a
request by Stroessner for a temporary entrance visa. Stroessner,
who ruled Paraguay for 34 years, was given political asylum by
Brazil and arrived there Feb. 5.
   Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Argana said Stroessner
needs surgery for prostate cancer and the Paraguayan government
asked the U.S. State Department to grant him a temporary visa for
humanitarian reasons, but ``the answer was negative.'' Argana is in
Brasilia, the Brazilian capital, for a diplomatic conference.
   After speaking to the press association, Rodriguez mingled with
the nearly 200 editors and publishers at the luxurious Yacht and
Golf Club on the outskirts of the capital, Asuncion.
   ``I would have liked him to be more emphatic in defense of
freedom of the press, but it's good just to have a Paraguayan
leader talking about it in general terms,'' said Eduardo Uliberri,
director of Costa Rica's La Nacion.
   ``The general feeling in talking to the delegates is: so far, so
good,'' said Douglas A. Gripp, director of Los Angeles
Times-Washington Post news service.
   George Neavoll, editorial page editor for the Wichita (Kan.)
Eagle-Beacon, said: ``The speech was hopeful,'' but ``it's still a
period of wait-and-see.''
   Rodriguez defended the coup that ended Stroessner's regime,
which was marked by confrontations with the Roman Catholic Church,
economic setbacks, military shakeups, political repression and
international isolation in its last months.
   ``It was a legitimate reaction to an intolerable state of
affairs that was dangerously deteriorating the image of my
country,'' he said.
   Rodriguez was introduced by Aldo Zuccolillo, editor of the
newspaper ABC Color, which was closed by Stroessner and allowed to
reopen, along with Radio Nanduti and the political weekly El
Pueblo, after the coup.
   ``We are enjoying freedom but we will not let down our guard,''
Zuccolillo said. ``Freedom can become a permanent way of life in
this country.''
   Rodriguez is the ruling Colorado Party's candidate for president
in May 1 national elections, which he is widely expected to win.
   Argana told The Associated Press in Brasilia that Stroessner,
76, must go to a country with advanced medical facilities and that
he may go to Switzerland.
   Stroessner is living in a beachfront mansion in the Atlantic
resort town of Guaratuba, about 500 miles southwest of Rio de
Janeiro.
   Stroessner initially said he planned to live in Brazil but
recently expressed the desire to join his wife in Florida.

<HEAD>Hank Williams Jr. Banned From Arena</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Country music star Hank Williams Jr. was
banned from an arena after he cut a concert short and angry fans
burned T-shirts and other souvenirs.
   Williams sang for only 40 minutes Sunday night at Viking Hall to
a crowd of 5,000 that paid $17.50 each for tickets.
   Williams, 39, offered the audience no explanation when he
suddenly walked off stage, said Terrie Smith, director of the
city-owned hall. Fans screamed and booed for nearly an hour after
Williams jumped into a limousine for the airport.
   Members of the arena's board were in the audience and decided to
ban any future performances by Williams.
   Kathy Gangwisch, Williams' publicist, said the performer was
sick with a cold or the flu. ``He wasn't feeling up to par, but he
thought he could do the show and wanted to go on rather than face a
postponement,'' she said.
   Ms. Smith didn't buy that explanation. ``He was obnoxious, but
he was definitely not sick,'' she said.
   David Elkins, a representative of the Eastern Kentucky Disc
Jockey's Association, said some fans burned souvenirs in protest.
Elkins said he also saw Williams throw drumsticks and other objects
at his band and staff members.
   ``It really bothers me that all these young kids look up to this
man,'' he said.
   Williams, who lives in Paris, Tenn., is known for such hits as
``Family Tradition,'' ``All My Rowdy Friends are Coming Over
Tonight,'' and ``Born to Boogie.'' His current hit is ``A Tear in
My Beer.''
   Williams has invited anyone with a ticket stub to attend his
April 14 show in Knoxville, Ms. Gangwisch said. Ms. Smith said she
tried to no avail to get Williams' management to leave money for
refunds after the concert.

   Protests and a memorial marked the
anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s death Tuesday in the city
where an assassin's bullet felled the civil rights leader 21 year
ago.
   ``To commemorate any year of a life or death of our civil rights
leaders is an event because Dr. Martin Luther King represents so
much to so many people,'' said Ron Walter, vice president of the
NAACP's Memphis chapter.
   ``(The anniversary) is a symbol of hope, a symbol of struggle
and of unmet American commitment to equality in American society,''
he said.
   The day was a holiday for city sanitation workers, whose strike
King had come to Memphis to support. The civil rights leader was
shot by James Earl Ray while standing on a balcony of The Lorraine
motel.
   On Tuesday the Rev. Osagyefo Suhkara Abdul Yahweh led a midday
march from the motel to the Clayborn Temple Church, where a
memorial service was held.
   Later, a ``Poor People's Campaign Rally'' was held in front of
The Lorraine, and anyone with a complaint was allowed to speak for
up to two minutes.
   ``Some talk about human services, some talk about juvenile
court,'' said the leader of the rally, Muhammad A.R. Ziyad.
   Most, he said, complained about the conversion of the Lorraine
into an $8.8 million civil rights museum. Ziyad's group has filed a
lawsuit in Memphis over the plans to demolish the motel and erect
the museum in its place.
   The original plan ``was to convert it to a shrine to Dr. King
instead of bringing in memorabilia from the gay rights struggle,
the Boston Tea Party and all this other involvements that has
nothing to do with Dr. King,'' Ziyad said.
   Another memorial was attended by striking members of a municipal
workers union, who then set up a picket line in front of the
Memphis Housing Authority.
   Elsewhere, about 400 blacks marched through the streets of
Niagara Falls, N.Y., to protest the city's refusal to declare
King's birthday a holiday. City officials say it would cost some
$110,000 to give workers another paid day off.
   ``We can't help but feel that this is a form of racism,'' the
Rev. William T. Spencer said at a City Hall rally.

   A cyclone on Tuesday battered
Australia's soggy east coast where people were beginning to dig out
from floods caused by three days of torrential rains.
   At least two people were killed, 10 were injured and scores of
buildings were damaged as Cyclone Aivu lashed areas of Queensland
state with 100 mph winds. Authorities declared the Burdekin
fruit-growing region a disaster area.
   Police said one man perished when his trailer was swept into a
creek near Ayr and another man was killed when the cyclone
collapsed his house in Ayr. Most of the injured people were hit by
flying debris and at least 160 homes were destroyed or badly
damaged, according to police.
   They said power was cut in many areas and there was more
flooding.
   Floods that ravaged the east coast the previous three days were
blamed for the deaths of four people and four others are still
missing.
   The weather bureau said that during one 24-hour period more than
12 inches of rain fell and it was Sydney's wettest March in 26
years.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Group Files Discrimination Suit Against Fast-Food Chain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A civil rights group Tuesday filed a
lawsuit accusing Shoney's Inc. fast-food chain of restricting black
employment and advancement.
   The class-action lawsuit was filed in federal court here by the
NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.
   ``This is a case of national importance because the employer is
a large and prominent corporation that employs a great number of
people,'' said Julius Chambers, director-counsel of the Washington,
D.C., organization.
   Shoney's operates about 1,550 restaurants in 30 states, mainly
in the Southeast, under the names Shoney's, Captain D's and Lee's
Famous Recipe Chicken.
   The complaint alleges that Nashville-based Shoney's set a policy
that limited the number of black employees in jobs with direct
contact with patrons and failed to promote or hire black workers
for managerial posts.
   Shoney's also was accused of firing blacks and whites who
complained about work conditions and dismissing blacks when their
numbers at a restaurant exceeded 30 percent.
   Shoney's spokesman Roy Vaughn said the allegations ``do not
reflect any policy or intent'' of the company.
   ``We intend to vigorously fight the suit and we expect to win,''
he said.
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and an end to alleged
discriminatory practices.
   Thomas Warren, a lawyer working on the suit, said he believes it
is one of the first racial discrimation cases with both black and
white plaintiffs. Four of the nine former Shoney's employees or
applicants named as plaintiffs are white.
   The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund was founded by the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1940
but is no longer affiliated with the NAACP. Since 1959 it has had a
separate board, staff and budget.

<DATELINE>SHAKOPEE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Dutch visitor on his way to an AIDS
conference in San Francisco was held in a Minnesota prison Tuesday
because immigration authorities believe he has the disease.
   The detention of Hans Paul Verhoef prompted denunciations from
AIDS activists and a San Francisco congresswoman. But immigration
officials said they were just following the law.
   ``We are holding Mr. Verhoef as an excludable alien because he
has a dangerous and contagious disease,'' said Tom Schiltgen,
district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
St. Paul.
   Verhoef, 31, of Rotterdam, was apprehended at the
Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport on Sunday by Customs officials who
discovered the AIDS drug AZT in his baggage.
   Verhoef, an AIDS prevention worker in his country, acknowledged
to immigration officials that he has acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Schiltgen said tests would be conducted to verify Verhoef has
the disease before authorities proceed with the case. The tests
should be completed without a few days, he said.
   Joseph D. Cuddihy, INS senior immigration examiner in
Washington, said 10 to 15 people with AIDS have been turned away at
the border prior to the Verhoef case, and an unknown number have
been denied visas in their native country.
   For years, immigration laws have required people who want to
visit or move here to establish they have no dangerous, contagious
diseases. Congress added AIDS to that list of diseases in 1987.
   Verhoef can withdraw his application for admission to the U.S.
and return to the Netherlands or appeal his exclusion to the INS,
Schiltgen said. He said Verhoef tentatively had decided to appeal.
   Verhoef was transferred Tuesday from the Scott County Jail,
where he was held since Sunday, to a medical facility at Stillwater
State Prison outside St. Paul, Schiltgen said.
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., asked the U.S. attorney general to
approve a waiver that would free Verhoef to complete his trip to
San Francisco.
   Dave Runkel, a top aide to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
said late Tuesday that the request for a waiver had not yet reached
Thornburgh's desk.
   ``We do not believe the intent behind the immigration law was to
exclude tourists,'' said Pelosi.
   ``He didn't try to hide it,'' added Steve Morin, an aide to
Pelosi. ``We also question this on humanitarian grounds _ putting
someone in jail under these circumstances.''
   The detention also drew fire from AIDS activists in San
Francisco, where Verhoef was to be a delegate to the International
Caucus of the 7th National AIDS Forum and the 11th National Gay and
Gay Health Conference. They were to begin on Wednesday.
   ``What everyone is concerned about is that this is really a very
upsetting precedent because it impacts the freedom of people with
(the AIDS virus) to travel,'' said Steve Huber, a spokesman for the
AIDS conference.
   Bea Roman, executive director of the National Lesbian and Gay
Health Foundation, said the conference is an important educational
exchange for health care providers and educators worldwide in terms
of AIDS prevention.
   She said the exclusion of someone with the disease ``is
detrimental to international cooperation in the fight against
AIDS.''
   About 1,500 people are expected to attend the conference.

   Authorities have not ruled out criminal
charges against other crewmen on the Exxon Valdez, including the
third mate who was in command when the tanker ran aground, a state
official said Tuesday.
   ``If our investigation finds evidence to support criminal
prosecution of any other person, we will do that,'' said Larry
Weeks, Alaska director of criminal prosecutions.
   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, who was fired and charged with being
drunk at the time of the accident in Prince William Sound, had left
Gregory T. Cousins of Tampa, Fla., on the bridge even though he was
not certified to be in command in that body of water.
   The third mate remains employed by Exxon, the company said.
Blood tests showed no alcohol in Cousins, invetigators said.
   Exxon spokesman Brian Dunphy said he did not know Cousins'
whereabouts.
   The Valdez also had a first mate and second mate aboard, but
Exxon does not know where they were at the time of the accident,
said spokeswoman Sharon Curran-Wescott. She would not release their
names.
   ``Obviously we want to know that answer to those questions
because it's clear the operating requirments of Exxon and the
federal government were not followed,'' she said.

<HEAD>Daley Never Wandered Far From Early Political Arena</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Chicago Election, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His nickname in high school was ``Mayor'' and his
traffic ticket on a trip home from college made front-page news.
Few men are to the manor born, but Richard M. Daley, almost
everyone said, was born to be mayor.
   On Tuesday, Daley realized that destiny when he was elected to
the office his father held for 21 years.
   Throughout a political career that had its beginnings nearly 30
years ago, the Daley name made many of Richard M.'s achievements
possible, diminished others, and left him forever open to the
charge that his vision extends only as far as his father's shadow.
   He lived at home until he was 30, and now, at age 46, still
lives only a few blocks from the bungalow where he grew up in the
working-class Bridgeport neighborhood. He looks, walks, talks, and
occasionally misspeaks in a way that makes him unmistakeably the
son of Richard J. Daley, the late six-term Chicago mayor and
big-city boss.
   ``He even began to look more like his father in recent weeks,''
said Eugene Kennedy, a Loyola University professor. ``He was
chunkier, more confident, he gave the same monosyllabic answers
with a lot of common sense in them.''
   The most frequent criticism of the younger Daley is that he has
the same politics as his father and will revive the Daley
``Machine.'' Kennedy, author of ``Himself,'' a biography of the
elder Daley, said he didn't think that was true.
   ``For one thing, a `Machine' like the old man's is a political
dinosaur that will never again roam the earth,'' Kennedy said, also
noting Daley's unsuccessful 1983 mayoral bid chastened him.
   The eldest son of seven children, Richard M. Daley cut his
political teeth working as an 18-year-old page for the Illinois
delegation to the 1960 Democratic National Convention.
   Daley graduated from law school in 1968. His father rewarded him
with a job as an assistant corporation counsel after he passed the
bar exam on his third try. The elder Daley also slated his son for
a seat in the Illinois Constitutional Convention.
   Then, in 1972, his father sent old Democratic machine warhorse
Ed Nihill packing and virtually handed Rich his seat in the
Illinois Senate.
   The younger Daley was criticized in his early years, called
little more ``his father's eyes and ears,'' and ``dirty little
Richie'' by one colleague for using his chairmanship of the
Judiciary Committee to routinely squash good-government legislation.
   But many of those same colleagues recalled how two events
changed him irrevocably. The first came on Dec. 20, 1976, when his
father died months into a sixth term. A year and a half later, his
third child, Kevin, was born with the crippling disease spina
bifida.
   ``After Dad died, Rich looked at himself for the first time
without Dad looking over his shoulder,'' recalled Daley's brother
Bill, his chief political strategist and the youngest of Richard
J.'s seven children.
   The strain of Kevin's illness may have an equally profound
impact on his life.
   Daley began taking a leadership role in such legislative issues
as nursing homes and abolishing taxes on some foods and medicine.
He showed a political acumen few thought him capable of, and forged
cautious alliances with the same reformers who often had opposed
his father.
   As a result, when he ran for the first of his three terms as
Cook County state's attorney in 1980, Democrats slated Alderman
Edward Burke to run against him. The younger Daley clobbered Burke,
then twice won re-election.

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Tuesday he would be willing to negotiate peace with ``anyone in the
world'' _ except the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Shamir began a 10-day U.S. visit Tuesday that will include a
meeting with President Bush on the Palestinian uprising.
   Speaking at the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations, Shamir would not disclose specific proposals
he planned present to Bush.
   But the 73-year-old prime minister said he would be willing to
discuss ending the uprising in the occupied territories ``with
anyone in the world if I thought it would bring peace. I would do
it now, today, this minute.
   ``But sitting with the PLO will not bring peace,'' he said to
applause. ``It will guarantee disaster.''
   Shamir was to depart for Washington on Wednesday to meet with
Bush. He was expected to tell the president he opposes an
international peace conference to end the 16-month-old Palestinian
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Shamir also has rejected the U.S. ``land-for-peace'' formula.
   The prime minister said earlier Tuesday that elections in the
occupied territories are ``one of the options we're thinking
about.''
   Bush, speaking Monday after meeting in Washington with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, called for a ``properly structured''
Middle East peace conference.
   ``Egypt and the United States share the goals of security for
Israel, end of the occupation and achievement of Palestinian
political rights,'' Bush said.

   Friends and supporters of William Heirens on
Tuesday pleaded for the release of the man sent to prison in 1946
for committing three sensational murders and scrawling on the wall,
``Catch me before I kill more.''
   Supporters told the Illinois Prisoner Review Board that Heirens,
who has been denied parole 28 times, is the very model of a
rehabilitated prisoner.
   But the brother and sister of one of his victims, 6-year-old
Suzanne Degnan, argued that Heirens, 60, would be a threat if freed
under executive clemency, and a prosecutor said Heirens is a
``secret killer.''
   ``I just fear for children,'' Betty Finn, sister of Suzanne,
said after the hearing. ``I don't want another family to go through
this again.''
   A lawyer for the parole board, Kent Steinkamp, said members will
send their clemency recommendation soon to Gov. James R. Thompson,
who will make the final determination.
   Heirens was a 17-year-old University of Chicago freshman when he
was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences. He pleaded
guilty to three murders and 25 burglaries.
   The dismemberment of the Degnan child followed the slayings of
two women, one stabbed, the other shot and stabbed. At one victim's
apartment, Heirens scrawled on a wall in lipstick, ``For heaven's
sake, catch me before I kill more. I cannot control myself.''
   Among the supporters urging Heirens' release was lawyer Arthur
O'Donnell, who said Heirens had gone from ``the depths of human
dispair'' to become the first Illinois prisoner to earn a college
degree behind bars.
   O'Donnell and other supporters described Heirens as a sensitive
man, always willing to help fellow prisoners. He argued that
Heirens should be released to show other inmates that there is hope
through rehabilitation.
   ``If we claim to be a civilized society, than perpetual
incarceration of anyone is antithetical to our society,'' said
O'Donnell.
   Assistant State's Attorney Joseph McNerney said Heirens's
supporters fail to see ``the nature of this man's problem.''
Outside prison, he said, Heiren would be a danger.
   ``He's a secret killer,'' McNerney said.

   The Nevada Senate on Tuesday killed
Bullfrog County, pop. 0.
   The county, formed in an attempt to prevent the federal
government from putting a nuclear waste dump there, was ruled
unconstitutional last year by the Nevada Supreme Court.
   It's ``not that I loved Bullfrog less, but that I loved Nevada
more,'' Sen. Thomas Hickey said in a eulogy that borrowed from
Shakespeare's ``Julius Caesar.'' ``As he was valiant, I honor him;
But as he was ambitious they slew him.''
   Hickey was a key sponsor of the bill that carved the
144-square-mile Bullfrog County out of Nye County in 1987. Bullfrog
County had no population, no roads and surrounded Yucca Mountain,
which the federal Department of Energy is studying as the possible
site for a high-level nuclear waste dump.
   Gov. Bob Miller and other state officials strongly oppose the
dump, and the desert county was formed solely to collect millions
of dollars from the government by imposing the highest property tax
rate allowed under the state constitution.
   But Nye County sued the state, contending it was entitled to any
money collected, and a Supreme Court justice ruled that Bullfrog
County was unconstitutional because, among other reasons, it lacked
a representative government.

   Police said Tuesday they held three people

   Police said the apartment was believed to be the abandoned
hideout of leftist terrorists.
   In the attic police found three pistols, a rifle, a
hand-grenade, three dynamite sticks, ammunition, two
radio-receivers, bullet-proof vests, material for counterfeiting
documents, and documents related to two different terrorist groups
_ the Red Brigades and Organized Communists for Proletarian

   Police said the hideout was probably abandoned in January after
officers arrested eight reputed members of the gang following a

   The cache was discovered by the apartment owner, who went to the

   A movie makeup artist was convicted
Tuesday of murdering two Los Angeles bomb-squad officers killed by
a pipe bomb they were trying to defuse in his garage.
   Donald Lee Morse, 39, also was found guilty of possessing a
destructive device.
   The jury, which deliberated for less than a day, also found
special circumstances that make possible a sentence of life in
prison without parole, said Deputy District Attorney Sterling
Norris. The prosecution did not seek the death penalty.
   Sentencing was scheduled for May 3.
   Detective Arleigh E. McCree, 46, head of the department bomb
squad, and Officer Ronald Ball, 43, were killed in 1986 by one of
two pipe bombs found at Morse's home.
   Police came upon the bombs while looking for a gun used by a man
in a ski mask four days earlier to wound an official of the Makeup
Artists and Hairstylists Union.
   Tests on a gun found at Morse's home determined it was not the
one used in the shooting. Morse never was charged in the case.
   McCree was a 21-year police veteran, twice a recipient of the
department's Medal of Valor and a world renowned bomb and terrorism
expert. He had been in charge of the department's bomb squad since
1979.
   The Marine Corps named him to a training team for Marines being
sent to Beirut after the October 1983 bombing of the Marine
barracks.

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Tuesday
he sees no way to stop the violence on the West Bank and in Gaza
that has taken more than 400 lives since Palestinian Arabs began
their revolt against Israeli control nearly 16 months ago.
   After meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III for two
hours, Mubarak said that ``if anybody could stop it, we would be
very pleased,'' then asked, ``But how?''
   The Egyptian leader, nearing the end of two days of talks with
Bush administration officials, made no public demands on the United
States or Israel. He said he was simply ``trying to find out what's
the best way to achieve peace'' through negotiations.
   Baker stood aside, and in his only statement to reporters said
``it is important that we try and create a climate that can move us
toward those negotiations and try and improve the atmosphere on the
ground.''
   The next step in the search is a visit beginning Wednesday by
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. He is expected to outline to
President Bush and Baker a plan for holding elections among the 1.2
million Palestinians who live in the territories won from the Arabs
in the 1967 Six-Day War.
   The idea behind Shamir's proposal is to have Palestinians choose
leaders to negotiate with Israel.
   Mubarak, who has insisted that Israel deal instead with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, withheld judgment on Shamir's
proposal. He said the criterion should be whether an election would
help advance the peace process.
   A U.S. official, briefing reporters later at the White House,
said, ``We want to listen to what Prime Minister Shamir has to say
about how the peace process can be moved forward.''
   While Shamir disclosed his proposal last week in Israel, he has
withheld details until he sees Bush and Baker.
   The U.S. official, whose identity could not be used under White
House rules, called the situation on the West Bank untenable but
declined to say whether the Bush administration held the PLO
accountable.
   ``I am not going to get into the causes ... and who is in
control,'' he said.
   The Palestinian rebellion, which Shamir and other Israeli
officials say was inspired and is maintained by the PLO, began in
December 1987 and has had the effect of enhancing U.S. interest in
the situation on the West Bank and in Gaza. Since the rebellion
began, 418 Palestinian Arabs and 18 Israelis have died.
   Mubarak, in response to a question, told reporters ``neither you
nor anybody else would be able to stop the intefadeh (uprising in
Arabic). ... Let us be realistic and practical. We all hope that we
could reach peace and avoid losing lives and spending money for
killing and bloodshed. ...''
   Earlier, in an appeal for additional U.S. economic and military
aid, Mubarak told 15 senators that his nation had adopted economic
reforms and needs a continued high level of U.S. help.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine described the
90-minute private meeting as ``very beneficial and fruitful'' but
said commitments on the aid issue were neither sought nor given.
   Both Mitchell and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas
said senators told the Egyptian president that the United States
must keep the large U.S. budget deficit in mind in dealing with all
requests for economic and military assistance.
   Mitchell said senators appeared favorably impressed with
Mubarak's description of Egypt's economic reform program, including
the reduction of subsidies on a number of consumer products and
revisions in the country's tax structure.
   ``The president argued that the pace he is pursuing is the one
most appropriate to their circumstances and the one most likely to
bring success,'' Mitchell said.
   The Egyptian leader is hoping that Congress will approve new
weapons sales once they are formally proposed by the Bush
administration and that $230 million in U.S. economic aid will be
released. The aid was withheld in March pending reforms in the way
Egypt manages its economy which that country must have in place by
June.
   Meanwhile, 200 American Jews said in a statement released by
Tikkum magazine in Oakland, Calif., that they challenged Shamir's
policies and urged him to begin negotiations with the PLO.
   ``Many American Jews, loyal supporters of Israel, do not support
the suppression of the Palestinian people and the continued
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza,'' the statement said. ``You
do not have a blank check from American Jewry to continue these
policies.''
   Tikkum is a bimonthly magazine that concentrates on political
and cultural issues of special interest to American Jews. The
signers included the comedian and writer Woody Allen, novelist
Philip Roth, playwright Arthur Miller and civil rights lawyer
Joseph Raugh.
   ``Begin negotiations with the PLO,'' the statement said. ``Not
only has the U.S. begun to talk to talk with them but recent polls
indicate that 58 percent of American Jews would support direct
negotiations with PLO leaders. ``If you are serious about seeking
peace, you must be prepared to talk directly with your enemies, and
you cannot expect to pick their representatives for them.''
   In a toast at a White House dinner honoring Mubarak, Bush said
called his two days of meetings with Mubarak ``productive, a time
for seeking common ground in approaching the peace process as well
as a good time to discuss the bilateral issues.''
   ``I firmly believe that peace will prevail if we continue to
work with a common purpose in the spirit of teamwork,'' he said.
``We must work to create a new atmosphere for Palestinians and
Israelis to put aside violence in favor of words. A dialogue for
peace for peace is the best way to establish Israeli security and
give the Palestinians their legitimate political rights.''
   Mubarak, in his toast, said Bush's presidency ushers ``a new era
of our freindship and cooperation,'' and called the president ``a
great friend of Egypt.''
   ``The American people have chosen you as the torch bearer at a
unique and critical juncture,'' he said. ``Together we have an
opportunity to make the middle east a much safer and more stable
place.''

<HEAD>Court OKs Trial For DES Lawsuits Filed Under `Toxic Tort' Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL STASHENKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's highest court Tuesday cleared the
way for trial of billions of dollars in lawsuits filed over DES,
which has been blamed for cancer and sterility in women whose
mothers took the anti-miscarriage drug.
   The Court of Appeals also determined that all companies that
made the drug should be liable for any DES damage awards won by New
York residents _ even if those companies never marketed their pills
in New York.
   Jay Mayesh, a lawyer for the pharmaceutical company Upjohn, said
the ruling makes New York the only state to say all DES
manufacturers are liable for some damages.
   The court upheld New York's 1986 ``toxic torts'' law, which
covers purported victims of five chemicals and permits them to sue
within three years after effects of the exposure are discovered.
Prior to the law, victims were required to sue within three years
of actual exposure to a toxic substance.
   The new law also gave those barred from suing under the old law
a one-year period in which to sue.
   Tuesday's ruling was praised by women who claim they were harmed
by the DES their mothers took between the late 1940s and early
1970s. The drug was marketed until 1971.
   In virtually every DES case, victims had been barred from suing
because the health problems didn't appear for many years after the
usual state statute of limitations had expired.
   However, Mayesh cautioned that the ruling only opens the way for
juries to hear claims that people were harmed by exposure to DES.
   ``The issues decided here are procedural only,'' said Mayesh.
``They do not address the fundamental question of whether DES
caused any of the health problems the plaintiffs claim it did. That
issue remains very hotly contested.''
   But in his ruling, Chief Judge Sol Wachtler said there is
``strong evidence'' linking DES exposure to ``later development of
serious medical problems.''
   More than 500 DES lawsuits seeking some $3 billion in damages
were filed during the ``window'' created by the toxic tort law.
   In addition to diethylstilbestrol, or DES, the substances
covered by the law are asbestos, tungsten-carbide, chlordane and
polyvinylchloride.
   In Wachtler's ruling, the Court of Appeals rejected drug
companies' arguments that the law violates their rights to due
process and equal protection.
   A stickier legal question for the court, apparently, was how to
determine which drug companies are responsible for the damages and
how much they should pay.
   The court decided unanimously that a ``market share theory,''
similar to one first formulated by California's top court, will be
adopted in New York for apportioning damages from the DES
litigation.
   That means drug companies in New York court cases will be liable
for a percentage of damages corresponding to the percentage of the
national DES market they controlled while manufacturing the drug.

   The Ethics committee on Tuesday interviewed
two men involved in a real estate deal with House Speaker Jim
Wright amid reports that Wright may have accepted $100,000 in
unreported gifts from one of them.
   The committee planned to resume its closed-door deliberations on
a long list of possible rules violations by Wright on Wednesday,
and a final outcome of the case still appeared to be more than a
week away.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the committee is
considering whether Wright violated rules by accepting use of a
Fort Worth condominium, a 1979 Cadillac and a salary paid to his
wife from Fort Worth developer George Mallick, a longtime friend
and business partner of the Wrights.
   House rules prohibit the acceptance of gifts of more than $100
from ``any person ... having a direct interest in legislation.''
   Wright has steadfastly denied violating House rules. But in a
new variation on the denial, Mark Johnson, a spokesman for the
speaker, said Tuesday that if the committee finds any rules
infractions, they would only be ``technical'' and not
``intentional.''
   The Washington Post, in its Wednesday editions, said the ethics
panel has concluded that several of the charges against Wright
should be dropped.
   Those include Wright's intervention with federal banking
regulators on behalf of hard-pressed Texas institutions, his
intercession with government officials on behalf of a Texas oil and
gas company, and his use of a government-paid staff aide to compile
parts of a book.
   Committee members met privately Tuesday with Mallick and with
Richard Swann, chairman of the Pioneer Savings Bank in Orlando,
Fla., to question them about an investment Mallick and Wright made
in ``Winderwood,'' a housing development undertaken by Swann and
others beginning in 1985. Wright made roughly $50,000 on the deal.
   ``We're fine-tuning what we already knew,'' said committee
member John T. Myers, R-Ind.
   The committee apparently is exploring whether Wright or Mallick
had direct financial interests in the health of the savings and
loan industry at a time when Wright was lobbying federal regulators
to be more lenient with ailing S&amp;Ls.
   One issue is whether a $2.2 million loan made to Mallick's sons
_ a loan Mallick co-signed _ by a troubled savings and loan to
develop a shopping center gave the developer an interest in
legislation calling for ``forbearance'' toward S&amp;Ls by federal
regulators.
   Wright on Tuesday denied any knowledge of the loan or a federal
lawsuit against the Mallicks to recover $1 million lost after the
loan was foreclosed.
   ``To say that I favored forbearance because of George Mallick is
ludicrous,'' Wright said. He noted that other Texas lawmakers had
fought for the same provision in the law ``because the economy of
our state was in crisis and our constituents were feeling the need
for help.''
   The ethics committee has been investigating Wright's finances
since last June and has spent some $1 million on a probe by its
outside counsel in the case, Richard Phelan.
   During depositions taken from Mallick last year, Phelan was
highly skeptical of benefits received by the Wrights from their
partnership with Mallick, known as Mallightco. That included the
condominium which Mallick made available to the Wrights for a token
fee, the use of the car, and Mrs. Wright's $18,000-a-year salary.
   Investigators ``doubted what she had done'' in return for the
salary, said one source familiar with the case. Wright denied that
the salary of his wife Betty was a gift. ``She performed work for
the pay she received,'' he said in answer to a reporter's question.
   The Journal said the panel has discussed a total value for the
benefits from Mallightco of $100,000, and said Phelan views the
benefits as unreported gifts.
   Mallick and his sons, Stephen and Michael, held a $2.2 million
loan from Interwest Savings Association of Fort Worth that was used
to develop a shopping center. The Mallicks defaulted on the loan in
1987, plus $100,000 in unpaid interest, and are being sued for the
$1 million that remained uncollected after the project was sold.
   Wright on Tuesday called Mallick a longtime friend and said the
developer had never asked him to vote for or against any
legislation. ``He has never asked me for official assistance in any
way, shape or form,'' Wright told reporters, adding that he had no
knowledge of Mallick's loan or the lawsuit until asked about it by
a reporter on Monday.
   In pretrial testimony last year, the senior Mallick testified
that federal regulators were partly to blame for his problems with
the loan because they were pressuring S&amp;Ls to foreclose on troubled
loans rather than extending additional credit and working with
borrowers to rescue investments.
   ``Many of the institutions were under the supervision of the
regulators,'' Mallick said in a deposition taken by Henry E. Kerry,
a Fort Worth attorney for Interwest.
   ``There was an atmosphere that existed, to where in earlier days
if you had problems like this, you were able to have the
flexibility to work them out. Because of this particular time in
our industry, that flexibility wasn't allowed, because of the
problems of the lenders themselves. They weren't able to be
flexible with their borrowers in order to maneuver and work things
out.''
   Mallick organized a 1986 meeting at which area developers and
lenders complained to Wright about the heavy-handedness of
regulators, and prepared a long report on the subject at Wright's
request.
   At the time, Wright also was lobbying colleagues to pass
legislative language requiring that regulators show ``forbearance''
to troubled S&amp;Ls, even taking the unusual step of convening
Democrats on the House Banking Committee to plead for such language
in a bill recapitalizing the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance
Corp., the Journal reported.

   ``Family-like,'' was how Castro on Monday night described the
talks after bidding Gorbachev good night on the steps of the

   When reporters pressed him for details, Castro had ready a
two-word linguistic hybrid: ``glasnost manana.''
   That was Castro's way of saying more on the discussions will be

   South Africa claimed the South-West Africa People's Organization

74-year rule of Namibia.
   SWAPO leaders denied the guerrillas involved in the fighting
near the Angolan border had crossed into Namibia and they lashed
out at U.N. adminstrators for agreeing to let South African troops
reinforce police battling the guerrillas.
   ``Our people are being butchered under the United Nations

   Foreign investors are descending on Hollywood
in a mad dash to find programming for the coming deregulation of
European television and to feed technologies including transmission
via satellite.
   Australia's Qintex Group offered $1 billion last week for ``Rain
Man'' maker United Artists, and Japan's Sony Corp. is browsing for
a major film production property.
   They are the latest in a recent wave of foreign investors that
have bought large and small studios here at a rate of almost one a
month.
   ``I think the wave is finally hitting the shore and starting to
break,'' entertainment lawyer and film producer Charles Meeker said
Monday.

   Doctors condemn cigarettes for causing
lung cancer, so it might seem strange to hear the former director
of the National Cancer Institute praising tobacco.
   But that's what happened Monday when a company announced plans
to turn tobacco plants into living factories for cheap mass
production of anti-cancer drugs, better sunscreen to prevent skin
cancer, and many other products.
   ``It is really kind of cute,'' Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr. said
during the American Cancer Society's science writers' seminar.
``It's a very interesting idea. It sounds too good to be true, but
looks real enough to pursue.''
   DeVita left his government post last year to become
physician-in-chief at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center.

<HEAD>Debbie Reynolds Stars in First Musical `Perry Mason'</HEAD>

   ``Perry Mason'' is doing its first musical
mystery on NBC this Sunday, but don't look for Raymond Burr to sing
and dance his way into your heart.
   Debbie Reynolds, in a guest appearance as a fading movie star
looking for a comeback in a Broadway-bound play, handles that chore.
   The two-hour movie, ``Perry Mason: The Case of the Musical
Murder,'' also stars Raymond Burr as the intrepid lawyer, Barbara
Hale as Della Street, William R. Moses and Alexandra Paul as his
new investigators, and Jerry Orbach and Dwight Schultz. It was
filmed on location in Denver.
   Reynolds performs as Amanda Cody, whose play is suddenly
derailed when the promising young stage manager is accused of
murdering the director. In the play, called ``Polly,'' she's a
bawdy house madam and sings two songs, ``Polly'' and ``Madam,''
written by the show's musical director, Dick Debenedictis.
   ``We did the musical in a lovely theater in Denver that Raymond
had gotten permission for us to use,'' said Reynolds. ``Polly's
like a Polly Adler. She runs a house of ill repute. That gives it a
little color, since it's not my image to play a madam. There aren't
many good scripts for a woman my age.
   ``I like to play characters. Amanda is the sort of lady who's
vain. She's a star, but she doesn't want to admit she's old enough
to have a son. The young stage manager is really her son but she
keeps passing him off as her friend. She's like Gypsy Rose Lee. You
never knew she had a son until she died.''
   She said it was her first time to work with Burr, who was an
established character actor when she began as a musical comedy star
at MGM. She was in such movies as ``Singin' in the Rain,'' ``Tammy
and the Bachelor,'' ``How the West Was Won'' and ``The Unsinkable
Molly Brown.''
   Reynolds was interviewed at her dance studio in North Hollywood,
where she was rehearsing ``The Unsinkable Molly Brown'' before
taking it on the road. Although she starred in the movie, she has
never done it as a play. She opens April 20 in Houston. Harve
Presnell, who co-starred on Broadway with Tammy Grimes, will appear
with Reynolds.
   ``I don't want to book the play into Los Angeles or New York
until it's proven,'' she said.
   She was also due to fly to London to promote her autobiography,
``Debbie _ My Life,'' which is just coming out in England. The book
is now in its second printing in this country.
   She is married to Richard Hamlett of Roanoke, Va., a real estate
developer who helps manage her business affairs.
   ``I keep saying I'm going to cut back, but I'm doing more now
than I did when I was 20,'' Reynolds said. ``I think I'm caught on
the cowcatcher. I can't get off. I still work in Atlantic City and
Reno.''
   The ``Perry Mason'' appearance is her first time on TV in about
a year. The last thing she did was a movie called ``Sadie and
Son,'' about a policewoman and her son. She said it was probably
intended as a pilot but she refused to sign a series agreement.
   ``I prefer to do theater,'' she said. ``The roles are better. I
don't want to compromise at my age and I don't want to go out doing
scripts I hate. I have to travel a lot, but I prefer that. You have
a choice. I'd teach before I'd do bad scripts.''
   Reynolds made two attempts at TV series, ``The Debbie Reynolds
Show'' about 20 years ago and ``Aloha Paradise'' in 1981. Both
shows were unsuccessful.
   She has owned the dance rehearsal hall about 10 years. The hall,
decorated with old movie posters and theater memorabilia, is a
favorite place for dancers to work out.
   Her last feature film was ``What's the Matter with Helen?''
about 18 years ago. Her daughter, Carrie Fisher, is very active in
feature films, most notably in the ``Star Wars'' films.

<HEAD>Marlee Matlin Makes Speaking Debut in TV Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Academy Award-winning actress Marlee Matlin
makes her speaking debut on Sunday in ``Bridge to Silence'' on CBS.
   Matlin, who is deaf, won an Oscar for her starring role opposite
William Hurt in the film version of the play ``Children of a Lesser
God.'' In that movie, and in a subsequent small role in the film
``Walker,'' she played a deaf woman who communicated with sign
language.
   ``Bridge to Silence,'' co-starring Lee Remick, Michael O'Keefe
and Josef Sommer, is a complex emotional drama that gives full
range to Matlin's considerable acting talent. Her speech is clear
and definite. Her character uses both spoken word and sign language.
   Matlin plays Peggy Warner, a deaf woman whose husband, also deaf
and a professor at Gallaudet University, is killed in a car
accident. Peggy is left seriously injured and unable temporarily to
care for her young daughter, Lisa.
   Remick plays Peggy's mother, Marge, a perfectionist who cannot
accept her daughter's disability, to the point of refusing to learn
sign language. Marge takes Peggy's injury as an opportunity to
appropriate perfect, hearing Lisa, played by Allison Silva, as her
own.
   Sommer plays Peggy's father, who is sympathetic to his daughter
and disapproves of his wife's manipulation.
   Michael O'Keefe (``The Great Santini'') plays Dan, a long-time
friend and director at the Theatre for the Deaf in Michigan, where
Peggy had met her husband, John.
   After John's death, Peggy withdraws in grief. In a confrontation
with Marge, Peggy shouts at one point, ``John loved me for what I
am! You never did!''
   Much of the movie's plot is made up of melodramatic devices.
Basically, Dan hauls Peggy back to Michigan in hopes that getting
her back into acting will release her from her pain. Of course, the
climax will be when Marge finally accepts her daughter and comes,
for the first time, to see her perform. The play that Dan casts
Peggy in is ``The Glass Menagerie.''
   Phyllis Frelich, who played the same role as Matlin in the stage
version of ``Children of a Lesser God'' and won a Tony, plays an
actress who appears in the play with Matlin. Frelich recently
launched a protest campaign against the CBS series ``The
Equalizer,'' complaining that a hearing actress was hired to play a
deaf woman in an episode.
   The movie tends to stretch an already meager plot even thinner
by such devices as having Lisa develop a high fever, the symptom
that years earlier portended spinal meningitis in Peggy and cost
her her hearing.
   Still, it's worth it just to see the performances of Remick and
Matlin. These two can lift the most predictable scene to a level of
high art. The capable direction by Karen Arthur also helps.
   But there are some nicely written scenes, too, such as the one
where the deaf actors sit around the dining table and toast absent
Lisa's birthday, singing an ebullient ``Happy Birthday To You''
out-loud and in sign language at the same time. Then they tell
anecdotes of childhood, poignantly recalling the difficulties of
public schools and hearing pupils and parents who were hard to
please.
   Of course, we know Peggy will eventually triumph and Marge will
see the error of her ways.
   Peggy's climactic speech to her mother will no doubt be
applauded by every deaf person who's ever contended with the
ignorance of the hearing world: ``I learned to speak for you, but
you never learned to sign for me. I'm deaf, but you're the one who
can't hear.''

<HEAD>Despite High Prices, Homebuyers Want More Amenities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation isn't the only reason for the big
price tags on new houses in recent years. Comfort and prestige on a
luxurious scale probably count as much, judging from a Census
Bureau report.
   Data from the report show that much of the new-home construction
market has gone upscale to a surprising extent at the very time,
oddly, that pressure is growing for more affordable housing for
young families.
   The situation poses a dilemma for housing markets: How can
existing owners continue to move up to more expensive housing if
first-time buyers cannot afford to buy the houses the more affluent
owners are leaving?
   Most of the demand for luxurious accommodations comes from
existing owners who, benefiting from rising market values in the
past few years, have amassed mountains of equity that can be
applied to fulfilling their housing dreams.
   Eventually, some housing people predict, the trend to more
expensive housing could automatically abort because of weakness in
the lower end of the market, leaving a dearth of the move-up buyers
with sufficient equity.
   The Census Bureau report shows that in 1988 the median size of
new homes was 1,815 square feet, compared with 1,605 square feet in
1984.
   More revealing are the amenities: 42 percent with more than two
baths, compared with just 28 percent in 1984; 26 percent with four
bedrooms or more versus 18 percent in 1984; and 75 percent with
central air, versus 71 percent.
   The proportion with more than one fireplace also rose, to 65
percent from 59 percent, as did the proportion with garages able to
accommodate more than two cars, 65 percent against 55 percent.
   A separate survey of homeowner preferences by the National
Association of Home Builders confirms that consumers seeking
another home look for more room and more amenities, and that they
won't accept stripped-down houses.
   At one time, basic houses were viewed by government and industry
officials as a practical means of providing shelter at relatively
low prices, while providing the owner the option of adding space
when finances permitted.
   Analyzing the figures, a Home Builder economist attributes at
least part of the luxury phenomenon to demographics, especially an
aging of the population, and income trends, or ``a greater
inequality in the distribution of income.''
   A more economical approach to housing, and perhaps more in
balance with an aging population, could be detected in figures for
multifamily housing, which includes many rental units.
   Those figures, from the same Census Bureau report, show the
median size of new units in 1988 was 935 square feet compared with
871 square feet in 1984. Units with two baths or more rose to 41
percent from 35 percent.
   However, economic or demographic pressure was revealed in some
of the other multifamily figures:
   The percentage with two bedrooms rose only 1 percentage point,
from 54 to 55, between 1984 and 1988. Units with three or more
bedrooms dropped to 8 percent from 9 percent.
   Moreover, the percentage of units constructed with air
conditioning fell to 84 percent from 89 percent.
   While these multifamily figures do suggest some leveling in the
demand for luxuries, they also remain extraordinarily high when
matched against some of the data from another Census Bureau study,
this one in 1940.
   In that census, the median value of owner-occupied homes was
$2,938. Thirty-one percent of existing homes had no running water,
45 percent lacked complete private plumbing, and fewer than half
had central heat.

<HEAD>Ancient Profession of Snake Charming is Dying in India</HEAD>

   In the land where it was born, the
ancient art of snake charming is dying and its half million
practioners are vanishing.
   Hunger haunts them. Police chase them. Ecologists despise them.
People on the street no longer care for them.
   ``Snake charming is no more a paying profession,'' said
90-year-old Sunder Nath. ``Our children are not interested in snake
charming any more. There is not enough money, not enough charm left.
   ``Our children want to become clerks, bus drivers, even
policemen, but not snake charmers.''
   Although he walks with the aid of a stick, Nath still holds road
side shows.
   The guru and saint of snake charmers is Gorak Nath, who they say
lived 500 years ago, and all snake charmers take his last name.
   Molarband, about 20 miles south of New Delhi, is one of the two
villages in India exclusively inhabited by snake charmers. The
other village is in the state of Orissa in eastern India.
   About 1,500 snake charmers live in Molarband in mud-and-stone
homes. Each home has 10 to 15 snakes.
   ``Gone are the days when our children lived with snakes, grew
with snakes,'' said Prabhu Nath, 50, whose two children attend a
government-run school not far from Mokarband. ``Now they are going
to schools to learn English.''
   ``When I grow up I would like to become bus driver,'' said
15-year-old Rajpal Nath, a ninth grader. ``My friends tell me that
snake charming is nothing but another form of begging. I don't want
to be called a beggar.''
   ``There is no value in our father's work. We are looked down by
everyone,'' added 14-year-old Rameshchand Nath, who wants to be a
bank clerk.
   About 250 of the 1,500 students at the school near Molarband are
from families of snake charmers.
   ``This is remarkable,'' said Ram Lal Longia, the school's
headmaster. ``Ten years back, we hardly had any student from the
snake charmers' families.''
   Experts say the ranks of India's 500,000 snake charmers are
declining fast.
   ``There are no new charmers joining the clan. What we have is
the old stock,'' said Komolesh Dev, who has spent months in
Molarband studying the life of the snake charmer.
   ``There was a time when snake charmers were part of Indian life,
they provided the best and cheapest entertainment.
   ``But today who cares for them? They are remembered only once a
year during the snake festival.''
   Every year on ``Nag Panchimi,'' or Snake God festival day,
Hindus pray to snakes and feed them. The brave among them wear
snakes around their necks and some even pose with them for
photographs.
   Women make snake beds in their homes and pray to snakes to give
them sons.
   ``Only on that day we are in great demand,'' said Sambhu Nath.
``We offer our snakes for hire and make good money. But it is only
one day of bright sunshine in a year.''
   A team of two snake charmers on the average makes about 75
rupees ($5) a day.
   ``From this amount we bribe the police, feed our snakes and run
our families,'' Sambhu Nath said.
   But there is no business during monsoon season and parts of
India's blistering summer.
   The Indian Wildlife Act prohibits the possession, sale or
purchase of about 30 of India's 240 species of reptiles, and the
ban includes the King Cobra, the most prized possession of a snake
charmer.
   ``You can't hold a show with rat snake,'' Prakash Nath said.
``It ought to be a King Cobra or at least a cobra. ... Only then
people are interested.
   ``First, it is difficult to find a cobra because forests are
vanishing and when we find one, we can't keep it forever as it is
against our tradition.'' When a snake charmer decides catches a
snake, he performs a rite and pledges to release it within a year.

   Audeh Rantisi remembers that on a Sunday
morning in July 1948 an Israeli soldier came to the door and told
his mother the family would have to leave the house and go to the
center of town.
   Audeh's father George, a soapmaker and landowner, locked the
front door of the four-room stone house, put the keys in his pocket
and started walking. He thought he would be home in time for dinner.
   But their footsteps on the dusty road took them into the
Palestinian Diaspora, and Audeh's parents did not return to live in
Lod.
   They were among the 600,000 to 760,000 Arabs who left towns and
villages in what is now Israel during the first Arab-Israeli war,
according to Benny Morris, an Israeli historian who has studied the
Palestinian refugee problem.
   The 1948 war started when Israel declared its independence and
Arab countries attacked the new nation. There was no state that
belonged to the Palestinians, and many Palestinians who lived in
the area that is now Israel left on the advice of Arab leaders or
to escape the war zone.
   Arabs who identify themselves as Palestinians now number roughly
4.7 million. About half of the Palestinians live in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, in the Israeli-annexed
section of Jerusalem or inside the borders of Israel. About 766,000
still live in refugee camps.
   The rest are scattered.
   A 15-month Palestinian uprising that began in December 1987 in
the Israeli-occupied territories and a decision by the United
States to talk with Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization have made the Palestinians and their future a main
element of the quest for peace.
   Because Palestinians living abroad seek the right to return to
their homes, most of which were long ago destroyed or belong to
Israeli families, the Palestinian Diaspora poses one of the
thorniest peacemaking problems.
   Israeli politicians of the right and left are united in opposing
the return of Palestinians to what is now Israel, and many Israelis
are concerned about an influx of former guerrillas and
improverished camp dwellers to a Palestinian state created from the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``The Palestinian can be, and has been, a Kuwaiti, a Jordanian,
a Syrian, an American, a European. But he never, under any
circumstances, gave up that identification of being a
Palestinian,'' said Dr. Mahdi Abdul Hadi, director of the
Palestinian Academy for the Study of International Affairs in
Jerusalem.
   For Audeh Rantisi, then 11, his three younger brothers and two
sisters, leaving their home meant joining a stream of thousands of
other Palestinians uprooted from Lod and Ramle on July 12-14, 1948.
   ``We didn't realize what was happening until we were out of
town. We hadn't taken anything with us, no money, no papers, no
clothes. Nobody thought we were being evicted for good,'' said
Audeh, who is now an Episcopal pastor and political activist in the
West Bank town of Ramallah.
   According to Israeli historical accounts, Israeli soldiers
cleared the towns to secure the strategic highway linking Tel Aviv
and the besieged city of Jerusalem during the battle for
independence.
   The Rantisi house later was rented by the Israeli government to
a Jewish family who immigrated from Morocco and was recently torn
down to make way for modern apartments. In one of history's
ironies, a Palestinian family had begun a Diaspora and a Jewish
family had returned from the Diaspora.
   Other Rantisi family members owned land at Lod where jet
airliners now take off and land at Ben-Gurion International Airport.
   Like other refugees, the Rantisis dispersed throughout the
world, first driven by war to the West Bank and later seeking
respite abroad from the Israeli occupation or in search of better
opportunities for jobs and education.
   Audeh and his two sisters stayed in the West Bank, which Israel
seized from Jordan in 1967. But his three brothers moved to
Toronto, Canada. Elias, 48, works for a candy company, Mahfouz, 41,
is an architect and Philip, 46, is a cabinet maker who first went
to Canada after working in Kuwait.
   Audeh's daughter Susan, 20, is studying biology at a college in
Aurora, Ill., and Hilary, 16, goes to a girls' preparatory school
in Bucknell, England.
   Two cousins, Johnny and Isa, are goldsmiths in Amman, Jordan,
where they fled after their Beirut shop was ruined in Lebanon's
civil war. Cousin Jamil still runs a grocery in the embattled
Lebanese capital of Beirut, and cousin Hany operates the
traditional family soapmaking business in Cairo, Egypt.
   Other relatives live in San Francisco, Chicago and Kenosha,
Wis., where Jacob and John own the Uptown Restaurant.
   The only branch of the family to remain in Lod, where only 8,000
of the 41,000 residents are Arab, is headed by Ibrahim ``Abu Isa''
Rantisi, 86.
   Over a cup of coffee laced with cognac, he said the Rantisi
family had lived in Lod since coming from the Mediterranean island
of Crete hundreds of years ago. About 20 percent of Palestinians
are Christians and most of the Rantisis are Greek Orthodox.
   Abu Isa watched his grandchildren play with Israelis in the
streets of the mixed neighborhood and said he was resigned to
living as part of a minority in a Jewish state.

   Do the Rantisis expect to return to Lod? Are they willing to
compromise and settle for a Palestinian state limited to the West
Bank? Would they return if a state was created?
   The answers are varied in the Rantisi family as they are among
Palestinians as a whole. But there is a shared, strong sense of
national identity, enhanced by pride in the success of the
intefadeh, the Palestinian uprising in Israeli occupied lands.
   Sitting on a cardboard box and sipping tea in his grocery store
near the Wehdat refugee camp in Amman, Jordan, Isa Samaan Rantisi,
44, recalled that he had grown up with stories about massacres and
expulsions and learned to hate Israelis.
   ``Now I have become older and have more learning. We cannot
throw the Israelis in the sea. We want that we live and they live,
and to give both peoples a right to coexist,'' said Isa Samaan.
   In the West Bank town of Nablus, Randa Rantisi, 30, is a teacher
whose students are active participants in the 15-month Palestinian
revolt. She said a mini-state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was
not enough.
   ``I want to go back and live where my parents lived before. If
Arafat wants only the Gaza and West Bank, maybe others like
(guerrrilla leader) George Habash will continue fighting for the
rest of Palestine,'' she said.
   Randa's older brother Ibrahim Khalil was more concerned about
the loss of business during the uprising than about the political
future. He is nonetheless indignant at the three times soldiers
forced their way into his house looking for stone throwers and at
being ordered on another occasion to clear a street of burning
tires and barricades.
   Hoda, 60, mother of Randa and Ibrahim, recalls proudly that her
cousin, George Habash, helped carry her daughter during the long
trek out of Lod in July 1948. ``He looked very sad and was saying
over and over, `God is with us and he will help us.'''
   Habash, a pediatrician, went on to become leader of the radical
Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and is now a
leading opponent of Arafat's renunciation of terrorism and
recognition of Israel.
   Audeh, 52, said the two-day forced march from Lod to the West
Bank was a bitter experience that left deep psychological wounds.
   The experience helped propel Audeh into politics. He was elected
deputy mayor of Ramallah in 1976 but deposed by Israeli authorities
in 1982 for refusing to cooperate with the army's newly created
civil administration.
   Audeh, a thin, intense, scholarly looking man who wears a black
frock and white collar, said the ``psychological healing process''
will take many years, but that he is ready to turn the other cheek
and make peace.
   ``I do not have hatred in my heart ... I am ready to forgive,
but not to forget my rights. God is a God of justice and
righteousness,'' said Audeh.
   Audeh has no desire to move back to Lod, saying his life now
revolves around his ministry and a private school he runs in
Ramallah. But he said statehood would bring back his brothers from
overseas and reunite the family.
   Would his family return?
   Elias Rantisi, who moved to Canada 20 years ago ``seeking a
better life,'' said he was ready to give up his suburban home near
Toronto, and take his wife and two children to Palestine the
instant a state was created.
   This sense of nationalism is reflected by his 14-year-old
daughter Madelane, who seems far more likely than her father to
realize such a dream. ``I don't say I'm a Canadian. I say I'm a
Palestinian if anyone asks,'' she told a reporter.
   But most of the Rantisi family living abroad gave uncertain
answers about whether they would risk uprooting their families.
   ``It's not easy to leave,'' said Jacob, 40, who owns the Uptown
Restaurant with his brother John, 30, in Kenosha.
   Memories of the West Bank are romantic: sweet plum and almond
trees, soft breezes and a slower pace of life. ``It's a happy life
without the complications. ... Here there's too much to worry about
_ money, bills etc.'' said Jacob.
   In Amman's gold market, leaning over a counter filled with
earrings and pendants, Isa Ibrahim Rantisi recalled that he visited
his birthplace in 1967 and found a Jewish family from Morocco in
the house.
   When he went inside the house, ``I remembered everything, it was
like a photograph.''
   Isa said he did not blame the Israeli family who rented the
house, but said he could not give up his right to return and
reclaim what belonged to his family.
   ``How could we give it up?'' he asked. ``If I don't get it back,
my son will.''

   Jacob and John Rantisi have built a life in
America, but their hearts and minds often are in a faraway land,
where they knew the joy of being united with family and the pain of
seeing their world torn apart.
   Today, the Palestinian brothers are U.S. citizens, grateful for
freedom and success in their adopted country, but worried about and
longing for the simple, yet turbulent, homeland they left behind.
   ``It's impossible to forget your language, your home and your
people,'' said Jacob, 40, who with his younger brother John owns a
restaurant in this industrial city.
   ``I am willing to be a good citizen of the United States,'' he
said. ``(But) there is no way you can forget your homeland. When
you grow up in a place, you learn to love that place.''
   ``I remember my friends,'' said John, smoking a cigarette as he
and his brother sat in a booth in their restaurant. ``It's my home.
It's inside of me.''
   From a cramped single room they shared in the West Bank town of
Ramallah, the 11 children born to Sulieman and Rose Rantisi have
migrated to all corners of the world _ Canada, Saudia Arabia,
Jordan, Israel and the United States, Three are in Kenosha with
their mother. Sulieman died in 1974.
   Two brothers, Jaber and Audeh, remain in Ramallah. Their cousin,
Audeh, an Episcopal priest also lives there. A sister, Nadia, lives
in Jerusalem. The family keeps in contact with letters and phone
calls.
   The Rantisi brothers, who are Christians, grew up with the state
of Israel. Shortly after Israeli soldiers forced most Palestinians
out of Lod during Israel's war of independence in 1948, Jacob was
born in a cold cement room in Ramallah without doctors or nurses.
   In the following decades, Israel conquered the West Bank and the
family lived with the turmoil of tanks in the streets, fear of
bombings and worries about eviction.
   But the brothers, who built furniture in a small shop, also have
fond memories of sweet plum and almond trees, soft breezes and a
slower pace.
   ``It's a happy life without the complications like here,'' Jacob
said. ``Over here, there's too much to worry about _ money, bills.
...''
   In 1976, Jacob and his wife, Victoria, came to Illinois. His
in-laws lived there and husband and wife began working in factories.
   ``We thought we could have a better opportunity here,'' Jacob
said. ``(There) the economic situation was very bad.''
   There were other motivations. ``You're not free there,'' he
added. ``If there's a demonstration or a bomb, it makes everybody
fear they're going to be arrested. ... There is no peace.''
   John, 30, a bachelor, followed in 1979 and also worked in a
factory. They saved their money and though they had no restaurant
experience, they bought a small coffee shop in 1985.
   The brothers work 13-hour days, seven days a week, washing
dishes, cleaning and cooking in their Uptown Restaurant, which is
simply decorated with salmon-colored Formica tables and brown
Naugahyde booths.
   ``We didn't get rich here but we have a better standard of
living,'' said Jacob. He said he and his wife speak Arabic at home
and try to instill Palestinian culture in their three children.
   The brothers say they are tied by blood and spirit to the land
they still call Palestine and are troubled by the violence of the
intefadeh, the uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   ``When you see it on TV, especially when they beat a person, 10
years old, or 12 years old, or a lady ... you get upset, you get
angry,'' Jacob said. ``It's a very, very evil thing that they treat
human beings like that. ... I know it happens in different
countries ... but when you see this happen to your own country,
your own people ... I don't think God himself justified this.''
   ``The Palestinians are suffering in a way like the Jews suffered
from the Germans,'' he continued. ``(By) beating people and
shooting people, breaking their arms, breaking their noses ... it's
the same. Killing is killing. Suffering is suffering. You can't
justify what Hitler did and you can't justify what the Israelis are
doing against the Palestinians.''
   The brothers are hopeful a Palestinian state will emerge, though
they aren't certain how it would affect their lives.
   A settlement is needed soon, John said, ``before it's too late,
before people get more anger and more hatred.''
   But Jacob said if one comes, ``I don't see it's going to last
for too long. Neither one will be satisfied with their share.''
   Would they return?
   Jacob said he might try to open a business, but would have to
give it careful consideration. ``I live here 12 years,'' he said,
``it's not easy to leave.''
   John agreed. ``If I go back home one day,'' he said softly,
``I'm going to miss America.''

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is a metropolis of refugees. The
capital of one country, it is filled with Palestinians who cherish
dreams of another country across the Jordan River.
   Amman was a dusty backwater of 35,000 people when the first
Arab-Israeli war broke out in 1948. That conflict, and its
successor in 1967, flooded Jordan with refugees and many of them
settled in and around the capital.
   Today, about 70 percent of the 1.2 million residents of Amman
are Palestinians, making it the largest urban concentration of
Palestinians anywhere.
   Well-educated Palestinians, many sending home money from jobs in
the Persian Gulf, helped make Jordan into one of the Third World's
success stories despite the country's lack of natural resources.
   Expensive cars roam Amman's streets and spacious houses sprawl
across its hills. Shops sell French cheeses, Italian clothes and
Danish furniture to a population that averaged more than $2,000 per
capita a year in income before an economic recession set in two
years ago.
   The Palestinian stamp is evident in the savory aroma of
Palestinian sweets wafting from bakeries, and in the elaborately
embroidered Palestinian dresses worn by many women.
   Young men wear the black-checked kaffiyeh headdress that has
become an emblem of the Palestinian uprising against Israel's
21-year occupation of the West Bank of the Jordan River.
   But Palestinians in Amman find themselves torn between two
nationalities: that of Jordan and that of a new Palestinian state
declared in November by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   That conflict led to a war in 1970 and the defeat of Palestinian
guerrillas by Jordan's Bedouin army. Palestinians refer to the
supression of the Palestinian state within Jordan as ``Black
September.''
   But for many, there is no conflict. They hope to remain in
Jordan at least part of the time even if they gain a state in
Palestine.
   ``I don't see that there has to be a choice,'' said Hazem
Nuseibeh, a former Jordanian foreign minister who comes from one of
Jerusalem's most prominent Palestinian families.
   ``To the contrary, I think if there is a solution it will be the
creation of a Jordanian-Palestinian confederal union.''
   Isa Samaan Rantisi, 52, an Amman grocer, expressed gratitude
toward the country that sheltered his impoverished family some 40
years ago, when it crowded into a one-room storefront in an Amman
ravine.
   ``They gave us everything here, more than any other Arab
country,'' he told a reporter. ``We don't think of ourselves as
strangers.''
   But his 18-year-old nephew Raed Shamali, like many youths in
Amman, said he yearns to go home to a country he has never known.
   ``If I could go, I would go. It's my country, we should go
back,'' said Shamali, who wore a scarf fringed in the green, black,
white and red colors of the Palestinian flag as he served customers
in the crowded store.
   In 1950, Jordan annexed the West Bank and gave the Palestinians
citizenship in Jordan. But Jordan lost the terrority to Israel in
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   King Hussein in 1988 renounced claims to the West Bank,
declaring ``Jordan is not Palestine'' _ a reference to proposals
from Israelis that Jordan serve as the Palestinian state rather
than let refugees reclaim property in what is now Israel.
   Hussein said Palestinians in Jordan would have ``all the rights
and privileges'' of Jordanian citizens until a Palestinian state is
created.

   In statehouses across the country, lawmakers fear any
significant alteration to Roe vs. Wade could trigger a political
war that would make their years as reluctant soldiers in the
abortion battles seem like a skirmish.
   The landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortion ended most of the fierce struggling over the issue in
state legislatures. But with the court reconsidering the issue,
legislators are worrying about a return to the incessant emotional
wrangling that preceded the ruling.
   ``If they overturn (Roe), it will be the most tragic thing to
happen in a long time,'' said Rep. H.L. Jensen, a Democrat from
Jackson, Wyo., who is the state House minority floor leader. ``It
will really be a nightmare.''
   The high court is scheduled to hear arguments April 26 on
Missouri abortion regulations struck down last July by the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Groups on both sides of the issue believe the Supreme Court
might use the case to modify, if not overturn, the Roe vs. Wade
decision. Thirty-four states banned or severely restricted
abortions in 1973, and 15 states still have anti-abortion laws on
the books, although legal experts say it is not clear they could
take effect if Roe vs. Wade was reversed.
   ``Gosh, I hope they don't stir that up again. (It) was one of
the worst things I've been through as a legislator,'' said
Republican Rep. Marvin Littlejohn, chairman of the Kansas House
Public Health and Welfare Committee, recalling the pre-Roe days
when strident, sign-carrying abortion foes jammed the statehouse to
protest Kansas' liberal law.
   The appeals court struck down key provisions of the Missouri law
that banned use of public hospitals or public employees for
abortions, prohibited use of taxpayer money for abortion
counseling, required doctors to test a fetus older than 19 weeks
for viability and declared that life begins at conception.
   Most states stayed out of the case, but a few decided to enter
the fray.
   Louisiana, which boasts of having the nation's most stringent
anti-abortion laws on the books, was joined by Arizona, Idaho,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in filing a brief with the Supreme Court
supporting Missouri's position.
   Massachusetts, which won a 1988 court case blocking Reagan
administration efforts to ban abortion at federally financed family
planning clinics, filed a brief arguing against Missouri. Its brief
was signed by California, Colorado, New York, Texas, Vermont and
West Virginia.
   Most states have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, but forces on
both sides of the issue have begun mobilizing support.
   ``I'm sure if they overturned the decision, there will be at
least a dozen legislators jumping in with bills,'' said Russell
Maffei, legislative aide to New Jersey state Sen. Gerald Cardinale,
a recently announced Republican candidate for governor. ``It would
be a knock-down, drag-out fight decided by half-dozen votes one way
or the other.''
   The Supreme Court's decision in the Missouri case, expected in
July, would come too late for the battles to begin this year;
instead, most legislators see themselves starting the new decade
under siege if Roe vs Wade is altered.
   ``That would tie up every legislature in the United States in a
bitter debate,'' said Bradford Gorham, Rhode Island House minority
leader.
   For some, such as Maryland, that means the continuation of a
no-win struggle that began in 1973 to whittle away at Roe vs. Wade
on a local level. Last year, business stopped for several days in
the Maryland Senate while anti-abortion lawmakers filibustered a
budget bill amendment to ease restrictions on Medicaid financing of
abortions.
   Pro-choice legislators hold a one- or two-vote margin in the
Maryland Senate _ not enough to stop a filibuster but sufficient to
block anti-abortion legislation. The result is a stalemate, a
situation not likely to change.
   ``There is a gridlock with very, very strong, intense views that
seem not to be able to get either position to move,'' Maryland
Attorney General J. Joseph Curran said. ``That's the reality of
this state.''
   A reversal by the Supreme Court likely would trigger new legal
fights over whether the anti-abortion laws still on the books in 15
states could take effect.
   In Maryland, for example, the old law required all abortions to
be approved by a hospital board and performed in a hospital. The
old laws in Arizona, Idaho and Wisconsin made all abortions illegal
except those to save a mother's life. In Oklahoma, the pre-Roe law
provided for a prison term of up to five years for anyone convicted
of performing an abortion.
   Abortion opponents have kept the issue alive in many states as
much as the courts have allowed. Two dozen states have passed laws
that mandate parental consent for abortions for minor women,
parental notification or both, and 10 or so are considering such
bills this year.
   All but a dozen states have cut off Medicaid financing of
abortions for poor women; in many of those states, efforts to
restrict that money come up year after year. In California, for
example, the legislature has passed abortion-funding limits every
year for the last decade, only to have them struck down by state
courts.
   Fights over such restrictions, while often heated and
disruptive, would pale next to the battles that might ensue if the
justices were to return abortion to state control, some observers
say.
   ``Once it goes back to the states and people will be playing
with real bullets, it's a whole different ballgame,'' said Michael
Friedman, a Democrat from Miami Beach in the Florida House.
   Many legislators predict a reversal of Roe vs. Wade would result
in the issue dominating the legislative and electoral processes in
many states.
   ``I've always said that if the court overturns on Tuesday, we'd
introduce legislation on Wednesday to outlaw abortions,'' said
Pennsylvania lawmaker Stephen Freind, leader of the anti-abortion
forces in that state's General Assembly.
   ``Any meaningful debate on any other public policy would come to
a standstill,'' said Roger Moe, majority leader in the Minnesota
Senate. ``The question would be: Are you for or against abortion?
That's how candidates would be picked, regardless of how they stand
on other important matters.''

   The first battles following any major
change in the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 ruling legalizing abortion
probably would erupt in Louisiana and 14 other states that still
have anti-abortion laws on the books.
   The laws now are unenforceable because of the Roe vs. Wade
decision, but there is debate over whether they could take effect
if the high court ever overturned the 1973 ruling. The issue would
head immediately for the courts.
   Louisiana's law says that if the high court ever reverses the
1973 decision, the state's anti-abortion rules go back into force.
Idaho and Illinois have similar laws.
   ``Our law is broad and general and says the state can regulate
abortions totally within limits of the U.S. Supreme Court
decisions,'' said Jo Anne Lavert, a staff attorney for Attorney
General William Guste.
   However, Democratic state Rep. Woody Jenkins, who has written
most of Louisiana's anti-abortion laws since 1973, said he doubted
the laws could take effect again and predicted a new law would have
to be passed.
   Daniel Stier, an assistant attorney general in Wisconsin, which
has an anti-abortion law on the books from before the 1973 ruling,
said he was not sure what would happen.
   ``Until we get a decision, it's so speculative it would be a
waste of time to guess what the effect would be on Wisconsin law,''
he said. ``There are an infinite number of possibilities of what
might happen to the laws on our books.''
   Stier said he would advise district attorneys not to begin
prosecuting women for violating state law if the Supreme Court
reversed Roe vs. Wade.
   Walter Turner, an assistant state attorney general in Alabama,
said his office could not speak specifically about the state's 1852
anti-abortion law unless the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade.
But he said there had been previous cases in which old state laws
went back into effect after the Supreme Court reversed itself.
   The other states with anti-abortion laws pre-dating Roe vs. Wade
are Arkansas, Arizona, Connectituct, Delaware, Michigan,
Mississippi, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, South Dakota and West
Virginia. An attempt to repeal New Hampshire's law has passed the
House and is now before the Senate.
   Louisiana officials contend the anti-abortion law the state
enacted in reaction to Roe vs. Wade is the most stringent in the
nation.
   Before 1973, abortion was a criminal offense in Louisiana.
Anyone giving an abortion could get up to 10 years in prison at
hard labor.
   Since then, Louisiana has passed many anti-abortion laws that
have been found unconstitutional by the courts. Among the
provisions thrown out were rules forbidding abortions in the first
three months of pregnancy, requiring doctors to test the fetus to
see if it could live, mandating parental consent for minors and
requiring abortions to be performed only at hospitals by physicians.
   The only two provisions upheld prohibit public financing for
abortions and require that parents of minors be notified of plans
for an abortion.

   New York was the nation's abortion capital
before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortions nationwide in
1973, and it likely would emerge again as a haven if the court ever
reversed the Roe vs. Wade decision.
   Women wanting to end their pregnancies would have more options
than they did 16 years ago, when 34 states outlawed abortions, but
New York still has very liberal rules on who may have an abortion.
   Some states allow the procedure only because of Roe vs. Wade and
would see renewed attempts to outlaw or restrict abortions. Fifteen
states still have anti-abortion laws on the books, although there
is debate whether they could take effect if Roe vs. Wade was
reversed.
   ``New York would retain the abortion laws it has now and women
from other states would come in here to get freely accessible
abortions, which would be a burden'' on health services, predicted
Janet Benshoof, director of reproductive freedom for the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   Under New York's law, abortions are permitted up to the 24th
week of pregnancy, as long as they are performed by a physician.
Abortions after 24 weeks are allowed if a woman's life is in danger.
   New York is one of just 12 states that still provide Medicaid
money for abortions for poor women, and it was the only one of the
16 states permitting abortions before 1973 that did not restrict
abortions to state residents.
   In neighboring Pennsylvania, by contrast, women under age 18 are
required to get their parents' consent for an abortion. The state
also requires women to be hospitalized for the procedure and to
report it to state authorities.
   Things are even more restrictive in some parts of the Midwest,
Benshoof said. She said she knows of women who have flown into New
York for abortions from Minnesota, where abortions are prohibited
after 20 weeks of pregnancy.
   ``All these reasons make abortion more delayed and more
expensive,'' she said. ``These women would want to come to New York
to avoid humiliation and unnecessary delay.''
   That was the practice during the brief period between the
legalization of abortion in New York in 1970 and the Roe vs. Wade
ruling. Young women stopped flying to England or Sweden and instead
came to New York.
   In 1972, a record 281,000 abortions were performed in the state.
By 1974, the first year after Roe vs. Wade, the number had fallen
to 162,000 and has been relatively constant ever since.

<HEAD>Consumer Food Prices Creep Up Moderately, Says USDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barring another big U.S. drought or a major
disruption of international markets by sudden global losses in crop
or energy production, it looks like another year of moderate food
price increases for American consumers.
   The Agriculture Department is forecasing that retail food prices
may rise 3 percent to 5 percent in 1989, about in line with the
upward creep of recent years. That estimate averages 12 monthly
projections.
   But food ecomomist Ralph Parlett says the USDA forecast could be
revised later this month following a review of the price situation
for the first three months of this year.
   ``What we're looking at, primarily, is that we've gotten so much
stronger first-quarter prices, particularly in fruits and
vegetables, than we had anticipated,'' Parlett said. ``We sort of
missed ... with the cold weather in California, and some in Florida
too.''
   According to the department's Economic Research Service, if the
1989 forecast is revised upward by a full percentage point _ to a
range of 4 percent to 6 percent _ and if it proves to be accurate,
the gains in food prices would be the highest in eight years.
   In 1988, the average of monthly food prices rose an average of
4.1 percent, the same as in 1987. The annual increases previously
included: 8.6 percent in 1980, 7.9 percent in 1981, 4 percent in
1982, 2.1 percent in 1983, 3.8 percent in 1984, 2.3 percent in 1985
and 3.2 percent in 1986.
   Denis Dunham, another USDA analyst, notes in a new review that
food costs ``rose at a much higher rate in the second half of 1988
than in the first half due to the severe drought and other market
factors.''
   By December, he said, prices were 5.2 percent higher than in
December 1987, the biggest jump since 1980.
   The average 4.1 percent increase in last year's food prices was
exactly in step with the broader rise in living costs as measured
by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 1987, when
food prices also rose 4.1 percent, the overall index gained just
3.6 percent.
   Economists look at two major components: food sold in grocery
stores for use at home, and meals and snacks consumed away from
home. The two rose at almost identical average rates over the
entire year.
   But measured from December to December, food prices in grocery
stores went up much more rapidly, partly because last summer's
drought boosted prices for fresh vegetables, cereals and bakery
products, eggs, and fats and oils. By December, the food-at-home
index was up 5.6 percent from a year earlier.
   Food served in restaurants, which is affected less by the costs
of raw products, increased only 4.4 percent from December to
December.
   Dunham said the cost of the traditional market basket of food
items used to compare retail, marketing and farm values from year
to year rose 3.5 percent in 1988. The market basket includes only
grocery items produced on U.S. farms. It doesn't include imported
products or seafood.
   One of the features of the USDA market basket analysis is the
``farm value'' of various products. It is a translation of prices
received by farmers into an equivalent amount for a specific item
or quantity of food.
   For example, the average retail price of a pound of Choice-grade
beef, as measured on an all-cut basis, was $2.55 in 1988. The
producer's share, or farm value, was $1.47, or 58 percent of what
shoppers paid. But that doesn't mean live cattle sold for $1.47 per
pound because it takes 2.4 pounds of live animal to make one pound
of supermarket beef.
   Items that require lots of processing _ beef does not,
relatively speaking _ show much smaller farm values. A one pound
loaf of white bread, for example, sold for 61 cents last year. The
farmer's share for all ingredients was five cents, or 8 percent.
And that was up a penny from 1987.
   Overall, the farm value of market basket food in 1988
represented about 30 percent of the total, unchanged from 1987 and
the smallest farmer's share of the consumer food dollar since USDA
began compiling such figures more than 75 years ago.
   Department records show the farm value or share of the food
dollar averaged 46 percent in 1913. The prevous low mark was 32
percent in the early 1930s; the high was more than 50 percent in
World War II and for several years thereafter.
   Some economists, including USDA's Parlett, say that the trend to
a smaller share for the farmer also reflects a growing consumer
preference for a greater degree of processing in food. Hundreds of
preparations, microwave items and many others commonly found in
today's supermarkets were unheard of a few years ago.
   It adds up to huge spending on food.
   In 1988, according to USDA analysts, consumers spent an
estimated $394 billion in 1988 for foods produced on U.S. farms, up
$19 billion or about 5 percent from 1987. That includes both meals
at home and away from home.
   Some $97.5 billion, or about 25 percent of the total spent, was
returned to farmers, a weighted blend of the 30 percent share for
food at home and the much smaller 16 percent share of spending for
food eaten away from home. In 1987, the farm share was $92.8
billion.
   The remaining $297 billion, or the ``marketing bill'' to get
food from the farm to consumers, went to the food industry for
handling, processing and retailing food after it left the farm.
That was up $14 billion.

<HEAD>Solving the Mystery Of Mr. Jefferson's Books</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following a trail that led from the University
of Virginia to a Georgia Army camp to the nation's capital, two
scholarly sleuths have come up with evidence of how Thomas
Jefferson enriched ``the beginning of the American mind.''
   On Thursday, the Library of Congress will publish the results of
their work, ``Thomas Jefferson's Library: A Catalog with the
Entries in His Own Order,'' in celebration of the 246th anniversary
of the birth of the book-loving second president.
   ``His library not only offers a key to his own thinking but also
symbolizes an admirable and important part of the cultural
tradition of the American society he envisioned and helped to
found,'' James Gilreath and Douglas L. Wilson wrote in their
introduction.
   ``We knew that Jefferson had selected his library to be the best
of what the Old World could offer,'' Gilreath said in an interview.
``But what is striking, to my way of thinking, is how much hope he
had for the New World to develop this.
   ``At the end he always includes the American books, which were
not at that time in the league with the European books. But it is
clear that what he is anticipating is that this is the beginning of
the American mind.''
   Gilreath, the head of the rare book division of the Library of
Congress, and Wilson, a Jefferson authority at Knox College in
Galesburg, Ill., claim to have solved a long-standing puzzle about
how the sage of Monticello divided up his books by subject matter.
   The mystery they set out to investigate revolves around the
library of approximately 6,700 volumes that Jefferson sold to
Congress in 1815 after the original congressional library was
burned by the British in the war of 1812.
   The books, carted from Monticello in wagons, formed the nucleus
of the present Library of Congress. Some two-thirds of them burned
in another fire in 1851, but about 2,700 of Jefferson's volumes
still occupy two room-long book stacks in a vault in the rare book
division.
   There has long been confusion, however, about how Jefferson
intended the books to be catalogued. He divided the books into the
categories of history, philosophy and the fine arts, an adaptation
of Francis Bacon's organization of knowledge into the categories of
memory, reason and imagination.
   Within these divisions, according to a letter he wrote to a
friend, he arranged the books in a ``chronological or analytical''
order.
   Librarian of Congress George Waterston, who wrote that he
single-handedly labeled and shelved the books when they arrived in
Washington, preserved Jefferson's main divisions but arranged the
books within each division alphabetically.
   Jefferson said the change ``much injured'' his catalogue.
Unfortunately, Waterston took Jefferson's own catalogue with him
when he was fired as librarian in 1829, and it has never been
located.
   In a massive five-volume work published by the library from 1952
to 1959, E. Millicent Sowerby tried to recreate Jefferson's
arrangement by using another manuscript catalog that Jefferson had
composed in 1783 and revised extensively by writing between the
lines. By the time she reached the fourth volume, Sowerby was
conceding that the catalog Jefferson sent to Congress with his
books ``differed substantially'' from the one she was using.
   At the time, Wilson, author of a soon-to-be published edition of
Jefferson's notebooks, was consulting the 1783 catalog, which is at
the Massachusetts Historical Society.
   ``I formed some very different ideas,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   Gilreath agreed with him.
   Gilreath went to the end of one of the shelves at the Library of
Congress that hold the original Jefferson collection, picked up a
slim volume that had lain there uncatalogued since 1954, and asked,
``Now, what do you make of this?''
   ``I think this is what we're looking for,'' said Wilson, a
professor of English and director of the Knox College library.
   The volume contained a manuscript catalog believed to have been
prepared for Jefferson in 1823 by Nicholas P. Trist, a young man
who would later become his grandson-in-law and his private
secretary.
   Correspondence between Jefferson at Monticello and Trist in
Louisiana showed that Jefferson had sent Trist a printed catalogue,
probably Waterston's catalog with Jefferson's handwritten notes of
the changes he wanted made. Using this, Trist prepared a manuscript
showing the way Jefferson wanted his books arranged. He sent it
back to Jefferson along with the printed catalog.
   The printed version has been lost, but Trist's manuscript was
found in 1917 in the library at Camp Wheeler in Georgia. It was
donated to the Library of Congress.
   The manuscript, bound in a volume along with a copy of the 1815
printed catalog, is inscribed, ``Pearce Lewis, 1834, University of
Virginia.''
   For years, the book was mistakenly labeled as a catalog of the
University of Virginia Library. Gilreath and Wilson believe
Jefferson may have intended it to go there, since he was organizing
the university's library at the time.
   At any rate, it was kept in the Library of Congress manuscript
collection until 1954, when somebody decided it should be in the
rare book division because part of it was printed.
   The first clue Gilreath and Wilson had was that Trist's
manuscript and the printed catalog covered the same books in a
different order.
   In the Trist manuscript, books were arranged according to
Jefferson's values: the Lewis and Clark expedition placed ahead of
the much earlier explorations of La Salle, recent books on Greek
and Roman ruins placed at the head of the chapter on architecture.
   ``So then we went to a lot of other sources and we discovered
this letter from Trist indicating that he was sending back this
catalog to Jefferson, that Jefferson obviously went to him and that
the catalog had been transcribed,'' Gilreath said.
   The clincher, he said, was when they were able to authenticate
the Trist manuscript by establishing that its paper and bindings
were identical with those in Trist's notebooks of the time.

   ``Mystic Pizza'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   The three young women who serve up ``Mystic Pizza'' at a small
restaurant in the coastal Connecticut town of Mystic are real
charmers.
   One (Annabeth Gish) is naive and serious and headed to Yale
University; her sister (Julia Roberts) is sexy and independent and
terrified she has nothing to look forward to; and their feisty
friend (Lili Taylor) is determined to break out of her
working-class mold.
   ``Mystic Pizza'' is a slice of their lives, spiced with romance
that thrills, amuses and sometimes disappoints the women. But the
best scenes are in the pizza parlor presided over by a cook
(Conchata Ferrell) who refuses to divulge the secret of her sauce.
   Their town, populated by working-class people who make a living
from the fishing industry, and by the Connecticut upper class, is
beautifully photographed.
   The three women give excellent performances. Vincent Phillip
D'Onofrio is very good as the young man who wants to marry Taylor.
But the plot is too predictable, and the feel a little too sappy.
Still, ``Mystic Pizza'' would make a fine accompaniment to a
neighborhood pie with all the works and an evening at home.

   ``Big Business'' (Touchstone. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated PG)
   
   What happens when a dithering nurse switches twin infants by
mistake? A match more bizarre than Shakespeare's ``A Comedy of
Errors.''
   Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin play dual roles in this comedy hit
from the Disney factory.
   The Shelton sisters, Sadie and Rose, are born in a West Virginia
town whose key industry is a quilting business. They arrive at the
same time when the wife of a company employee gives birth to her
twins. Their names? Sadie and Rose, of course.
   Years later, Sadie (Midler) Shelton is the lizard sharp head of
a mulinational that wants to sell the West Virginia firm,
Hollowmade, for stripmining. Rose (Tomlin) Shelton is the _ as
Midler says _ ``wispy''twin who loves animals, the outdoors, feels
out of place in New York and doesn't want Hollowmade sold.
   Seque to West Virginia. Sadie (Midler) Ratcliff feels out of
place in the country and wants out. Sister Rose (Tomlin) wants to
fight the Sheltons to keep Hollowmade.
   The Ratcliffs come to New York. Through a mixup at the airport,
they are mistaken for the Sheltons and taken by limo to the Shelton
suite at the Plaza Hotel. The Sheltons arrive _ by subway. It's
only a matter of moments before the sisters collide.
   And that they do in the ladies room. Where else? Midler does a
wonderful mime with herself as she discovers her other ``half.''
   After confusing lovers, hotel workers and company execs, it all
works out in the end.
   ``Big Business'' is a small movie and, therefore, perfect for
the home screen. As a theatrical release, it is thin, and needed
more flesh to sustain it.

   Crude oil futures declined in nervous trading
after near-normal activities resumed at the Valdez, Alaska, port,
which was partially blocked after a recent oil spill by an Exxon
Corp. tanker.
   Wholesale home heating oil also declined Monday, but unleaded
gasoline gained almost a penny a gallon on what analysts called
seasonal demands.
   Crude prices started out stronger but fell by midday after news
surfaced that the daily pipeline flow at Valdez had been increased
to 1.3 million barrels.
   ``Crude had been overbought from the Valdez crisis,'' said James
R. Steele, an energy analyst with Refco Inc. ``The opening of the
pipeline further relaxed the situation.''
   The pipeline usually carries 2 million barrels of crude a day.
But that was reduced to 800,000 barrels a day after the spill,
causing shortages at West Coast refineries and sending oil prices
higher.
   The Alaskan pipeline carries nearly one-quarter of the United
States' domestic supply of crude oil.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, slipped 24
cents to settle Monday at $19.95 a barrel. The contract had lost 62

   Among refined petroleum products, the May contract for heating
oil fell 0.62 cent to 52.75 cents a gallon. The April contract had
gained 0.71 cent on Friday, the day it expired.
   May unleaded gasoline settled at 67.85 cents a gallon, up 0.88
cent. The April contract, which also expired Friday, had ended the
week with a 2.12 cents gain.

   A group led by ex-baseball commissioner Peter
Ueberroth could present a reduced bid for strike-torn Eastern
Airlines to a committee representing Eastern creditors at a meeting
today.
   The Ueberroth group plans to lower its $464 million bid for
Miami-based Eastern, sources close to the sports figure and
businessman said Monday.
   The reduced offer would reflect developer Donald Trump's new
agreement with Texas Air Corp. to buy Eastern's prized Northeast
shuttle for $365 million, the sources said. Ueberroth's original
proposal _ which was withdrawn last week after he was informed it
had been topped by another suitor _ was for all of Eastern,
including the Boston-New York-Washington shuttle service.
   Separately, union and airline sources said Monday that the
15-member committee representing unsecured creditors of Eastern was
asking those interested in buying the airline to present their
offers at a meeting today.
   Union sources also said that the Air Line Pilots Association has
agreed to meet in the next few days with possible Eastern suitor
Jay Pritzker, head of the Hyatt Corp. hotel chain.
   The Ueberroth group on Thursday withdrew its $464 million offer
for Eastern after Texas Air said it had been ``materially'' outbid
by another suitor, identified by sources as Pritzker.
   However, Texas Air hasn't eliminated Ueberroth's bid from
consideration, sources close to the company have said.
   Pritzker offered about $500 million for the entire airline,
according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Hyatt
chairman is expected to meet soon with the Eastern pilots union,
possibly today, union sources said.
   Pritzker's offer is comprised of about $100 million in cash and
the rest in debt securities, according to sources. The Ueberroth
group, on the other hand, has said its $464 million offer included
about $200 million in cash.
   Takeover strategist Carl Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans
World Airlines Inc., also has expressed interest in Eastern and has
garnered support from its unions. But he has not yet presented an
offer to the Texas Air board.
   The Ueberroth group offered to give Eastern employees a 30
percent stake in the airline in exchange for salary concessions.
The proposals by Pritzker and Icahn would involve similar
arrangements, according to sources.
   Ueberroth, Icahn and Pritzker were reported to be unavailable
for comment when contacted Monday.
   In addition to reviewing bids, the creditors committee also may
discuss strategy and organizational issues related to Eastern's
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws,
according to people familiar with the proceedings who asked not to
be identified.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, who is overseeing
Eastern's reorganization, has asked members of the creditors
committee not to discuss developments at today's meeting with the
press, the sources said. The meeting, possibly the first of a
weekly series, is expected to be held in the offices of lawyers
representing one of the creditors, they said.
   The creditors committee includes representatives of major
aircraft and engine manufacturers, banks acting as trustees for
Eastern bondholders, and the Eastern Machinists and pilots and
non-union employees.
   The panel has the right to review any reorganization plan
proposed by Eastern and can propose its own plan to the bankruptcy
judge. It represents unsecured creditors, who are the most likely
to lose money in the bankruptcy reorganization because they have no
collateral, or security, from Eastern in case of default.
   The Machinists union at Eastern struck the airline March 4,
drawing the support of pilots and flight attendants and bringing
operations to a virtual halt. Eastern was forced to seek
reorganization and bankruptcy protection from creditors five days
later as its cash reserves dwindled.

<HEAD>Free Financing For 2-Year Loans At Chrysler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has upped the ante in
what could be a high-stakes, match-me incentive game by offering
interest-free financing on two-year loans for all of its cars.
   The nation's No. 3 automaker made the move Monday, five days
after Ford Motor Co. challenged the other automakers with 2.9
percent financing for two-year terms. General Motors Corp. followed
Ford's lead a day later.
   Interest-free automobile financing was last offered in September
1986 by American Motors Corp., which Chrysler bought less than a
year later.
   Chairman Ben Bidwell of Chrysler Motors Corp., the corporation's
car-making arm, called the free financing deal ``the ultimate in
APR (annual percentage rate) programs.''
   ``It can't get any lower,'' he added. ``It can't get any
simpler.''
   In addition to the low financing for two-year terms, each of the
Big Three also expanded and boosted some of their cash rebates and
offered 5.9 percent financing for three-year loans and 6.9 percent
for four-year notes.
   Ford and GM will write a five-year loan for 9.9 percent, 1
percentage point lower than Chrysler's rate for a 60-month term.
Chrysler's program runs indefinitely. Ford's expires May 31 and
GM's runs out June 5.
   For a customer financing a $13,000 car with $1,000 down, meaning
a $12,000 loan, the monthly payments on a two-year loan would be
$500 under Chrysler's interest-free incentive, and $515.24 under
Ford and GM's 2.9 percent plans. A two-year loan at 11 percent, a
common open-market rate, would be $559.29 a month.
   For a more-common 48-month loan, a buyer of either a Chrylser,
GM or Ford car would pay $286.80 under the 6.9 percent loans
offered by the Big Three. With a market-rate loan of 11 percent, a
48-month loan would come to $316 monthly.
   Each of the companies acknowledged that the incentives would cut
into their profits, and Bidwell said the company's earnings during
the first six months of 1989 would be below last year's levels, and
then rebound in the second half.
   But automobile analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. of New York disagreed.
   ``I think the gradual increase you've seen in sales incentives
over the last three or four months will have a significant
impact,'' he said. ``I think Chrysler's earnings are likely to be
flat. A few months ago, I was looking for a good-size increase.''
   The incentive war comes on the heels of unexpectedly low early
1989 sales and inventories that have been causing some worry, but
no panic, among automakers. Each of the Big Three automakers set
ambitious production schedules for the first few months of this
year, and there are no large-scale moves to curtail them yet.
   Car and light truck sales through the first 80 days of 1989 have
been running 5.4 percent behind the same period last year, the
second-best in the industry's history.
   Sales figures for the first quarter of the year are due out
today. The automakers are hoping that the new incentive programs
will give sales a boost during April, when they usually are strong
as Americans look forward to summer vacations and weekend driving
trips.
   Interest-free financing affects only two-year loans, which in
the past have made up about 12 percent of Chrysler Credit Corp.'s
business. Jerry Farrell, president of loan-making company, said he
expected that percentage to double with the new program.
   He also said the 6.9 percent interest rate for 48-month loans,
down from 8.9 percent in Chrysler's previous incentive program,
will attract buyers who may have been considering five-year notes.
   Chrysler, unlike Ford and GM, has not seen a growing number of
repossessions and loan defaults in the five-year loan category,
which makes up about 60 percent of the company's vehicle-loan
business.
   The interest-free loan deal was well received by dealers the
corporation talked with during the weekend, said Tom Pappert, vice
president for sales at Chrysler Motors.
   But the program is bound to face strong criticism from Ron
Tonkin, president of the National Automobile Dealers Association.
   Late last week, after Ford and GM announced their new incentive
programs, Tonkin called the incentive war a ``circus.'' He urged
automakers to get out of the match-me incentive games and ``lower
the prices once and for all and guarantee the public those are the
prices.''
   But Bob Lutz, president of Chrysler Motors, said that won't
work. Rebates frequently are used to bolster the credit-worthiness
of a potential buyer by increasing their down payment, he said.
   ``We would greatly prefer to operate the way we used to operate,
...'' Lutz said Monday, ``but the reality is that isn't the world
we live in anymore. Whether we'll ever get out of it is anybody's
guess.''

<HEAD>36 More Boeing Planes Found with Crossed Wires; Total Now 95</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-six more Boeing Co. jetliners have been
found with crossed wiring or plumbing in fire-suppression systems,
bringing the total number of Boeing planes with the problems to 95,
the Federal Aviation Administration said Monday.
   The 36 additions all belong to foreign carriers, KIRO-TV quoted
the FAA as saying.
   FAA spokesmen in Seattle were not immediately reachable by
telephone Monday night to confirm the data.
   As of March 10, the FAA had received reports of 59 Boeing planes
with crossed wires, KIRO reported. The problems have been found
over the last year.
   The 36 planes either had crossed plumbing lines or crossed
wiring in the fire emergency system, and most of the planes were
built since 1981, KIRO reported.
   The FAA early this year ordered inspections of about 740 Boeing
737s, 747s, 757s and 767s produced since 1981 to resolve concerns
about crossed wiring. Most foreign aviation agencies ordered their
carriers to make similar inspections.
   Boeing earlier confirmed that the repeated wiring mishaps have
prompted the company to start an engineering study in an effort to
prevent crossed wires and pipes.
   Two main miswiring problems can occur in the engine and cargo
fire warning and suppression system and could interfere with the
fire extinguishing system in planes, KIRO reported.
   Of the 95 total discrepancies, 68 were wiring problems, the
station reported. Of that number, 24 planes had wiring problems in
the engine fire warning and suppression systems and 44 planes were
found to have cargo fire warning and suppression systems wiring
problems.
   The other 27 discrepancies were plumbing problems, which were
all on 767s.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Filed To Stop United Artists Sale To Qintex</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM and PM-Foreign Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York trust filed suit Monday in an
attempt to halt the sale of United Artists to an Australian company.
   The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court, came just three days after
Qintex Group proposed the purchase of the Los Angeles-based movie
studio for $1 billion, the biggest of a series of moves by foreign
firms to buy Hollywood companies.
   The Chappaqua Family Trust alleged that the price to be paid for
UA's assets is ``inadequate, unfair and fraudulently determined.''
   Investor Kirk Kerkorian, who owns 82 percent of the company's
stock, and the Tracinda Corp., Kerkorian's holding company, along
with Qintex Entertainment Inc. are named as defendants.
   Chappaqua Family Trust also alleges that UA executives were
derelict in their duty to stockholders because the sale, scheduled
for completion on Sept. 30, was ``designed specifically to enable
defendants Kerkorian and Tracinda to unfairly withdraw substantial
value from the company and to solidify and retain control over the
balance of the company's valuable assets.''
   Calls to Qintex offices in Los Angeles and to UA spokesmen after
business hours Monday were not answered.
   Under the deal announced Friday, Qintex agreed to acquire all
outstanding stock of UA's parent company,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer_United Artists, at $20 a share.
   Qintex, best known in the United States as one of the makers of
the CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove,'' would get the UA moviemaking
group and its film library.
   But Kerkorian would retain control of the MGM name and its TV
and movie studios, as well as 34 MGM movies, including
``Moonstruck'' and ``A Fish Called Wanda.''

<HEAD>C&amp;S Board Rejects NCNB Buyout Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Citizens and Southern Corp. is relying on a
regulatory shield to fight an unwelcome $2.4 billion takeover
attempt by the NCNB Corp., a merger that, if completed, would
create the nation's sixth-largest bank.
   The board of the parent company of the Atlanta-based C&amp;S Bank
voted unanimously Monday to reject the NCNB Corp. offer, calling it
``inadequate,'' and saying C&amp;S' management can better serve the
bank's customers, shareholders and communities than can NCNB.
   The surprise bid for C&amp;S followed a push by NCNB into Texas last
year, in which it bought into the Republic Bank Corp. of Dallas.
The move by the Charlotte, N.C.-based corporation drove its stock
price up 50 percent, enabling NCNB to mount other takeover drives
with stock, not cash.
   ``We have managed this bank for service, growth, profitability
and long-term service to shareholders _ not for a quick sale,'' C&amp;S
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bennett A. Brown said in a
statement.
   ``The board of directors and the management have concluded that
this offer is clearly inadequate and not in the best interests of
C&amp;S shareholders, customers and employees,'' he said.
   In a statement Monday night, NCNB called its offer ``fair and
generous'' and said its legal advisers felt there was no regulatory
block to such an acquisition.
   ``We are determined to proceed, and request the C&amp;S board to
reconsider our offer and promptly authorize negotiations,'' the
release said.
   H. Rodgin Cohen, a New York lawyer specializing in bank
takeovers, said Monday there is ``some chance'' NCNB Corp. would
respect the wishes of the board.
   Cohen is acting as special counsel to C&amp;S. He said C&amp;S is the
stronger bank and that the Federal Reserve Board has frowned upon a
weaker bank taking over a stronger one.
   He also said the government is worried about banks that grow
radically faster than their peers. Along with the Texas
acquisition, acquiring C&amp;S would mean NCNB would expand its size
threefold in a year.
   Because of the structure of the C&amp;S board of directors, he said,
NCNB could not control it until two years after a takeover and
noted that the government had rejected mergers with similar
problems because of potential disruptions and discord between the
board and the majority stockholders.
   Ben E. Johnson III, a tax specialist with Alston &amp; Bird, the
Atlanta law firm representing C&amp;S, said the acquisition might be
blocked at the state level because by virtue of having more than 20
percent of its deposits in Texas, NCNB Corp. cannot be considered a
member of the Southeastern banking compact.
   Georgia banks cannot be sold to banks outside the compact.
   He said Georgia bank examiners might balk at the prospect of
NCNB moving Georgia capital from C&amp;S to Texas to ``finance a
speculative investment in a state outside the region.''
   NCNB, the Southeast's largest banking company, surprised C&amp;S and
financial observers Thursday with its $2.4 billion stock offer. C&amp;S
management was cool to the idea from the start.
   NCNB told C&amp;S it wanted to begin ``active merger discussions''
within five business days.
   Also Monday, the C&amp;S' board voted to adopt a new article in the
corporation's bylaws, under Georgia's Business Combination Act,
preventing any major shareholders from engaging in a business
combination for five years, unless certain conditions are met. The
move could make a takeover more difficult.
   A combined NCNB and C&amp;S would create a formidable bank with $76
billion in assets. NCNB officials characterized their buyout offer
as friendly and vowed to leave C&amp;S' managers _ and its name _ in
place in Georgia.
   Under NCNB's plan, C&amp;S shareholders would get 1.075 shares of
NCNB common stock for each of their C&amp;S shares.
   NCNB would have to issue about 66 million new shares to provide
C&amp;S stockholders with the $2.4 billion.

<HEAD>Minnesota Will Fight Northwest Takeover Attempt, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY R. SANDOK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rudy Perpich and other Minnesota
officials are pursuing a number of options aimed at thwarting a
takeover of Northwest Airlines, a move they see as a threat to the
state's economy.
   ``They're in for one hell of a fight,'' House Speaker Robert
Vanasek said Monday of two groups that have proposed buying
Northwest's parent company, NWA Inc., which is based in suburban
Eagan.
   Investor Marvin Davis has offered to buy NWA for $2.62 billion,
or $90 a share. Davis owns 3 percent of NWA's 29.1 million shares.
A second, unidentified group of investors that owns 4.9 percent of
the stock also is interested in buying the company, NWA says.
   NWA stock closed down 50 cents Monday at $84.37{ a share on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Vanasek was among the legislative leaders and constitutional
officers from both political parties, union officials and others
who pledged at a news conference to back Perpich in what he has
described as an ``all-out war'' against a hostile takeover of the
nation's fourth-largest carrier and one of the state's largest
employers.
   NWA has indicated its board will review the Davis offer, which
he insists is friendly, but the company has said it intends to
remain independent.
   The airline has not asked for state assistance, state officials
have said. But unionized machinists, pilots, and flight attendants
have asked the state to help ensure that Northwest remains an
independent company and that Minneapolis-St. Paul International
Airport remains a Northwest hub, state Commerce Commissioner
Michael Hatch said.
   The Democratic governor said the following actions are being
taken:
   _U.S. Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., who chairs a House aviation
subcommittee, assured state officials that he will conduct a
hearing to investigate the financial background of any major
investor involved in a potential Northwest takeover. Such an
investigation, Perpich said, would be aimed at ensuring the
investor ``had the financial capability to operate Northwest
Airlines in the professional manner on which the economy of
Minnesota depends.''
   _Members of the Minnesota congressional delegation are being
asked to develop an anti-takeover strategy at the federal level.
   _The U.S. Justice and Transportation departments will be asked
to thoroughly review any proposed sale.
   _Legislation that would grant the Minnesota commerce
commissioner authority to approve a change of ownership of a
corporation that occupies a controlling market share of any segment
of the transportation industry is being researched for possible
introduction in the state Legislature.
   _The state attorney general's office is looking into the
possible anti-competitive effects of a takeover of Northwest and
legal remedies available to the state.
   _Legislative leaders are looking into possible legislative
proposals aimed at protecting state workers and state public
investment in the event of a buyout.
   Asked which items on the list might thwart a takeover, Perpich
said, ``We don't know, but we're going to explore every possible
avenue.''
   Industry analysts said it was unclear what, if anything, state
officials could do to block a takeover.
   ``It makes total sense for them to do what they can, but how
much of an impact can they have?'' asked Kurt Rivard of
Minneapolis-based Dain Bosworth Inc.
   If Davis upholds his promise of expanding the airline and
keeping its headquarters in Eagan, the state would be worse off by
blocking a takeover, said Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst for
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. of Philadelphia.
   ``No management should be entrenched to the exclusion of a
sale,'' Marckesano said.
   The Legislature moved swiftly in June 1987 to block the
threatened hostile takeover of Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson
Corp. by Dart Group Corp. by passing anti-takeover legislation. But
the law does not affect NWA, which is chartered in Delaware.
   The anti-takeover legislation played a role in the defense of
Dayton Hudson, but the October 1987 stock market crash _ which
slashed millions of dollars from the value of Dart's holdings _ is
largely credited with saving the company from takeover.
   Analysts have warned that a takeover of Northwest would almost
certainly result in the firing of some of the company's 35,000
employees.
   Northwest has about 17,000 employees in Minnesota. Perpich said
an additional 70,000 Minnesotans whose livelihood depends on the
airline operation also would be affected by a takeover.
   Monday's Wall Street Journal suggested that NWA could defend
itself from takeover bids by issuing a special dividend to
shareholders. NWA could easily raise money for a special dividend,
analysts told the newspaper, because it owns 73 percent of its
aircraft fleet, the second highest percentage of the eight major
U.S. airlines. NWA could sell the planes and lease them back.

<HEAD>Columbia Savings And Loan Investigated As Part Of Drexel Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association
confirmed that federal investigators are examining whether it
engaged in illegal trading with the high-yield bond department at
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The thrift has given ``cartons of documents'' to the U.S.
Attorney's office in New York and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said Kenneth R. Heitz, Columbia's executive vice
president and general counsel.
   Some Columbia employees have been subpoenaed to appear before a
New York grand jury investigating criminal allegations against
Drexel, he said.
   However Drexel, which already has agreed to plead guilty to six
violations of securities fraud laws, said in a prepared statement
that it was confident no wrongdoing involving Columbia had occurred.
   ``Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association has been one of the
largest customers of the Drexel Burnham Lambert high-yield bond
department, and we continue to have an important business
relationship with that group,'' the company said.
   ``Like virtually every important customer of Drexel's high-yield
bond group, Columbia has produced to the SEC and the U.S. attorney
its entire trading records with Drexel for the past five- to
seven-year period.''
   The Los Angeles Times, quoting unnamed sources, reported today
that at least one Drexel employee gave testimony several ome months
ago to the grand jury about Drexel's dealings with Columbia.
   Columbia has grown rapidly and earned large profits by using
deposits to invest heavily in the high-risk, high-yield junk bonds.
   Columbia's chief executive, Thomas Spiegel, has been described
as a close business associate of Michael Milken, head of Drexel's
Beverly Hills-based high-yield bond department until his indictment
last week.
   Milken, his brother, Lowell Milken, and former Drexel trader
Bruce L. Newberg were charged with racketeering and securities
fraud in a 98-count federal criminal indictment that had been
expected for months.
   Heitz declined to say who had been subpoenaed, but said Spiegel
was not among those called before the grand jury.
   Columbia said it conducted its own internal inquiry into trading
with Drexel.
   ``We have found nothing which indicates that any of the trading
activity between the two companies is anything other than normal
arm's length business transactions,'' the company said.

   NCR Corp. announced today it plans to sell
its South African subsidiary and market its products through a
distributor.
   NCR Products in South Africa will be distributed by Fintech
Ltd., which will acquire a controlling interest in the subsidiary.
The balance of the shares will be acquired by European investors.
   Fintech is a subsidiary of Allied Electronics Corp. Ltd., or
Altron, a South African-owned group of technology-based companies.
   The transactions are subject to certain conditions, including
government approval. Terms were not disclosed.
   ``The decision was a difficult one,'' said M.Y. Stephan, vice
president of NCR's Latin America-Middle East-Africa group. ``It was
based on a careful evaluation of the interests of all NCR
shareholders, including the customers and people of NCR in South
Africa.''
   W.P. Venter, Altron chairman, said the company plans to retain
the subsidiary's management and its approximately 500 employees.
   NCR said the impact on revenue or earnings would not be
substantial.

   Lockheed Corp. announced the creation
of a $500 million employee stock ownership plan today, one day
after an investor group said it held a 5.3 percent stake in the
aerospace company.
   Lockheed said it would issue 10.5 million new shares for its
employee stock ownership plan, known as an ESOP, then buy back the
same number of shares on the open market. The buyback was intended
to offset the dilutive effects of the plan on the company's
oustanding stock, Lockheed said.
   Many companies have used ESOPs as defensive moves against
hostile takeover attempts. Last month, Polaroid Corp. defeated an
unwanted bid from Shamrock Holdings Inc., with an ESOP as part of
its defensive strategy.
   ``We don't deny it has defensive characteristics, but that was
not the primary purpose for the ESOP,'' Lockheed spokesman Bob
Slayman said today. ``The primary purpose is to create employee
incentive tied to shareholder growth and value.''
   On Monday, Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons disclosed that his
group, Valhi Inc., has a 5.3 percent stake in Lockheed. But Slayman
said today that the ESOP ``had been under consideration here for
some time.''
   Simmons said his group's stake in Lockheed bodes no takeover
attempt of the aerospace giant, a company he said is running just
fine as it is.
   The company has taken defensive steps against Simmons in the
past. When Valhi said last December it wanted to increase its
holdings to more than $15 million, Lockheed said it was
implementing a ``poison pill'' shareholder rights plan.
   The plan would allow current shareholders to buy newly issued
stock at a discount if an outsider buys 20 percent or more of the
common stock. The effect would be to make it much more expensive
for someone to take over the company.
   In December, Valhi owned 0.63 percent of Lockheed's 59.5 million
outstanding shares.
   In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, Lockheed
fell 87.5 cents to $48.87{ a share, after a delayed opening. The
stock rose $3 a share on Monday.
   Lockheed also announced steps today to help reduce its costs.
   The company said it would phase out its information systems
group and sell the group's four units. No asking price was given.
   Lockheed also said it would sell real estate in Burbank, Calif.
made available by the ongoing relocation of its aeronautical
systems division to sites in California and Georgia. The company
said its was accelerating the relocation to take advantage of what
it called more efficient facilities.
   These steps and the ESOP ``will enhance our competitiveness in a
rapidly changing environment where premiums are placed on
innovation, efficientcy, quality and focused management,'' Lockheed
Chairman Daniel M. Tellup said.
   Simmons said in a telephone interview Monday he did not intend
to try to take over the aerospace giant, which produces the secret
F-117A stealth fighter and is home to the famed ``Skunk Works'' _
the advanced development project area at Lockheed's Burbank plant
where such innovations as the P-80, the nation's first fighter jet,
and the high-flying U-2 and SR-71 spy planes were developed.
   Simmons said he might sell some of his stock if it rises another
$3. He said he had not considered how many shares of Lockheed he
might buy.
   ``We view Lockheed as a well-managed company,'' Simmons said in
a Friday letter to Lockheed management, a copy of which he released
Monday. ``We have no plans, or desire, to disrupt management. We
expect to be a constructive, long-term shareholder.''
   Simmons said he is investing in Lockheed because he believes its
stock was undervalued late last year due to anticipated cuts in the
federal defense budget. Lockheed share prices were at $39 and
averaged into the low $40s when he began acquiring them, he said.
   In February, Lockheed reported profit from continuing operations
rose 3.5 percent in 1988, but profit rose 48 percent if proceeds of
the sale of its Dialog computerized information services were
included.
   Lockheed said it earned $624 million, or $10.37 a share, in
1988, up from $421 million, or $6.41 a share, the previous year.
That profit was boosted $182 by the sale of Dialog.
   Lockheed defense projects include the radar-evading stealth
fighter, the Trident 11 nuclear missile, the C-5B transport plane
and work on military communications, satellites, and the Strategic
Defense Initiative, or Star Wars. The company is also a
subcontractor for design work on NASA's space station project.

   Dow Chemical Co. said today it has entered
a joint venture to build a $50 million chemical plant in China and
joined a group of companies studying a venture to expand a Soviet
chemical plant.
   Dow said it entered a 50-50 joint venture with China's Zhejiang
Chemical Factory to build a $50 million chemical plant in Ningbo,
China.
   The new company, Zhejiang Pacific Chemical Corp., will produce
chemicals for China's growing polyurethane foam industry, reducing
its dependence on imports, Dow said.
   The company's Dow Canada subsidiary was awarded a $15 million
contract to aid in design, engineering, procurement of equipment
and training of operating personnel for the plant, which will
employ more than 200 people.
   The plant, in Zhejiang Province on China's east coast, is
expected to be operating in 1993, producing 20,000 metric tons a
year of polyether polyol, Dow said.
   Polyether polyol is used to make foam for furniture, seat
cushions, mattresses, automobile parts, laminated fabrics and
building and refrigerator insulation.
   The Chinese plant also will produce 5,000 metric tons a year of
propylene glycol for use in pharmaceutical products, solvents and
polyester resin.
   Dow also said it joined a consortium of Western firms, including
Dow Europe SA and Litwin Cos., launching a four-month feasibility
study of a joint venture with the Soviet petrochemical industry.
   The group is studying expansion of a petrochemical complex in
Shevchenko in the Soviet Union to add the manufacture of styrene
plastics and ethylene derivatives. If the project proceeds, total
capital is expected to amount to less than $1 billion, with Dow
Europe and Litwin Cos. providing less than 50 percent of that, Dow
spokeswoman Sarah Opperman said.

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares of stock in America's best-known
brothel are on sale in its home state.
   Seven weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission
approved the initial offering of stock in the Mustang Ranch, the
Nevada Securities Division permitted the sale of a limited amount
of the issue on Monday, according to Judith Allan, education and
research coordinator for the agency.
   Allan said the division approved sales of $350,000 worth of the
$23.3 million offering after receiving a $300 filing fee and a
supplemental prospectus it had requested from the company making
the offer that detailed potential risks to investors.
   She said the remaining $23 million of the stock offer was
expected to be authorized once the state received an additional
$2,130 filing fee.
   The bid to take the Mustang Ranch public at $20 a share is about
80 percent sold out and the initial offering should close in about
a week, according to the president of the firm handling the sale.
   Eric Walloga, whose Tampa, Fla.-based American Wallstreet
Securities Inc. is overseeing the initial offering, said he
expected the issue to sell out once Nevada joins the nine other
states and the District of Columbia where the stock is being
offered.
   Since the offering was approved by the SEC in mid-February,
Walloga said the stock had been approved for sale in Florida,
Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland, New York, Connecticut,
Colorado, Hawaii and the District of Columbia.
   He represents Mustang Ranch Inc., an investors' group composed
primarily of Reno businessmen and attorneys that wants to raise the
money to buy the brothel 10 miles east of Reno from Joe and Sally
Conforte.
   Once the initial offering is sold out, the brothel can
officially change hands and the stock will be traded over the
counter, Walloga said.

   Futures prices for wheat were mostly lower but
corn and soybeans were higher today in early trading at the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Analysts said wheat was being sold largely because of
profit-taking after Monday's closing rally and the lack of
confirmation of rumors concerning a big sale to China.
   ``The feeling is corn and soybeans were oversold yesterday,''
research director Jerry Gidel of LIT America Inc. said.
   Corn also was being supported by the sale overnight of 450,000
metric tons of the product to the Soviet Union, he added.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 4 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.04{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents

<TEXT>
   Portland State University business courses
will be used by the Khabarovsk Institute of National Economy in a
new master's degree program that Soviet educators say reflects
their country's changing economic structure.
   The economic restructuring, or perestroika, brings greater
financial responsibility and the need ``to be a real businessman,''
said Pyotr M. Konevskih, rector of the institute in Khabarovsk,
about 30 miles north of the Chinese border and 350 miles northwest
of Japan. Khabarovsk is Portland's sister city in the Soviet Union.
   About 5,000 students attend classes at the institute.
   ``Our hope is that we'll be putting hundreds of students through
this program,'' said Earl Molander, program coordinator and
chairman of the management department in Portland State
University's School of Business Administration.
   About 50 students specializing in industrial management are
expected to start classes this fall to prepare them for the
program. The full program, expected to cost the Soviets $250,000,
will start in April 1990.
   ``It will be a great challenge, taking a business curriculum
designed for a market economy and Western culture and to use that
as a framework to educate a current generation in a centrally
engineered economy that is becoming more market-oriented,''
Molander said.
   Soviet educational and business systems differ greatly from
those in the United States, so the Portland State program will be
adjusted to the Soviets' economic system, while retaining basic
features like accounting, management, communication and marketing,
Molander said.
   Some concepts, however, don't translate easily, he said. The
term ``marketing'' had to be adopted straight from English into the
Russian vocabulary because there was no Russian equivalent,
Molander said.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange closed
higher but below session peaks on Tuesday as a weak early trend on
Wall Street curbed some of the optimism generated earlier in the
day by the pound's recovery.
   Sterling's rise underpinned the market throughout the trading
session, easing earlier fears that the British government would
have to raise interest rates again to defend the currency. The
recovery followed the pound's plunge in Far Eastern trading on
Monday.
   But most of the market's gains were later erased by the weak

points, or 0.2 percent, higher at 2,082.8, near the day's low of

   Lawyers of the Bhopal gas leak victims
Tuesday cautioned the Supreme Court against accepting a declaration
by Union Carbide Corp. concerning compensation money to the
victims, news reports said.
   Union Carbide, in an affidavit, said it had complied with the
court's order to deposit a part of the $470 million compensation
for the victims of the Dec. 2-3, 1984, gas leak, United News of
India news agency said.
   More than 3,400 people were killed and at least 20,000 injured
when deadly methyl isocynate gas spewed from a pesticide plant run
by the Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide in the central Indian
city of Bhopal.
   Three lawyers, arguing on behalf of some victims, said that once
the court accepted the declaration, the U.S multinational would
refuse to submit to the jurisdiction of the Indian court, United
News of India said.
   The five-judge panel will hear arguments Thursday on the
objections by Shanti Bhushan, Soli Sorabji and Indira Jaising.
   The panel, headed by Chief Justice R.S. Pathak, on Feb. 14-15
ordered Union Carbide to pay $465 million as compensation following
a Feb. 14 settlement between the Indian government and Union
Carbide. The company had earlier give $5 million to the Red Cross.
   Union Carbide's attorney told the court that under the terms of
the settlement the compensation money had been deposited and the
``settlement orders stood complied with,'' United News of India
reported.

   Harris Associates LP, a Chicago-based investment
consultancy, has built up a 6.18 percent stake in Blue Arrow PLC,
the British employment agency said Tuesday.
   The stake of 44.47 million shares was taken for Harris' private
clients and doesn't represent a threat to control, said Bruce Gray,
Blue Arrow's secretary.
   ``We're quite pleased, actually,'' Gray said, noting that Harris
Associates had been a strong backer of Manpower Inc., the
Milwaukee-based employment agency taken over by Blue Arrow in 1987.
   The stake was built up over ``the last two to three months,''
Gray said.
   Blue Arrow has been the object of takeover bid speculation for
several months. Monday, Mitchell Fromstein, chief executive of Blue
Arrow and formerly head of Manpower, confirmed that several
takeover offers had been made for the company but none amounted to
a serious bid.
   Fromstein said no fresh offers for the company had been made
since he assumed his post in January, following a boardroom shuffle
which ousted Blue Arrow's founder and chairman, Antony Berry, from
management control.
   Blue Arrow shares finished unchanged at 91.5 pence ($1.56) on

<TEXT>
   Now that Tyson Foods Inc. has tenders
for about 55 percent of the shares in Holly Farms Corp., the next
move in the battle for control of Holly Farms is up to ConAgra
Inc., an analyst says.
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry producer, began its
attempted takeover of Holly Farms last fall. Holly, based in
Memphis, Tenn., responded by working out a stock-swap agreement
with ConAgra, based in Omaha, Neb.
   On April 14, shareholders of Holly Farms and ConAgra will be
asked to vote on the proposed merger.
   Tyson has extended its offer of $63.50 per share for Holly Farms
and said Sunday it had tenders for more than 10 million of Holly
Farms' 18.4 million outstanding shares. ConAgra has stuck by its
$59.25-per-share stock swap.
   ``The ball is in ConAgra's court now, and I believe that we will
see ConAgra either increase its bid or step out of the picture,''
Napoleon Overton, an analyst with Morgan Keegan in Memphis, said
Monday.
   ``The rules prohibit us from claiming victory, but this is very
encouraging,'' Jim Blair, Tyson's chief counsel, said of the status
of the tenders.
   ``The deal, as it is, looks like (shareholders) are going to
vote against the ConAgra merger. In order for ConAgra to win, it
needs a vote of over 12 million shares. But I'm not claiming a
victory.''
   A shareholder places a tender by calling his broker and
requesting it, but he can withdraw the tender any time, Overton
said. ``It's an indication, not a promise,'' he said.
   ``Someone can tender shares and still vote for the ConAgra
merger,'' Holly Farms spokesman Ted Bailey said. ``I've spoken to
shareholders that have done that.''

<TEXT>
   Conrail named CSX Corp. executive James A.
Hagen Tuesday as its new chairman, president and chief executive to
fill a vacancy left by the death of Richard D. Sanborn.
   Sanborn died on Feb. 12 after six weeks on the job from what was
described as an apparent heart attack. He was 52.
   Hagen, 57, is currently president and chief executive officer of
CSX Distribution Services Group in Baltimore, part of the rival
Richmond, Va.-based CSX. He officially joins Conrail on April 17.
   Hagen will officially join Conrail April 17. He will be
nominated to the railroad's board of directors at the company's
annual stockholders' meeting May 17. His appointments are to be
effective May 18.
   Hagen was Conrail's senior vice president of marketing and sales
from February 1977 to March 1985.
   Before his first stint with Conrail, Hagen had been president of
the United States Railway Association, the government agency
established to plan for the creation of Conrail out of six bankrupt
rail companies, including the Penn Central in April 1976.
   He will succeed Stanley E.G. Hillman, who was elected by
Conrail's board to the interim position of acting chairman,
president and CEO Feb. 15, after Sanborn's death. Hillman will
remain on Conrail's board after Hagen takes over.
   ``Mr. Hagen will bring a wealth of outstanding qualities to his
new position at Conrail, including his earned reputation as one of
the outstanding marketing executives in the reilroad industry, and
his substantial first-hand knowledge of Conrail as a company,''
said Hillman.
   Hagen was not in his office Tuesday to comment on the
announcement, his secretary said.
   In January, Sanborn said that studies were under way to see
whether Conrail should diversify into other transportation-related
businesses _ for example, hauling solid waste or operating sanitary
landfills to which the railroad would haul trash.
   Asked if Hagen intended to continue Sanborn's programs, a
Conrail spokesman referred to Hillman's comments as released by the
railroad. In that statement, Hillman said, ``Mr. Hagen is dedicated
to continuing specific programs initiated by Mr. Sanborn in
strategic planning, in making further improvements in customer
service, in new business exploration, and in safety, all of which
have been endorsed by Conrail's board of directors.''
   CSX said Glenn P. Michael, senior vice president for sales and
marketing of CSX Distribution, will take over the duties of the
departing Hagen.

<HEAD>British Mining Group Promises Big Dividend If It Doesn't Deliver</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consolidated Gold Fields PLC on Tuesday unveiled a
novel defense against a hostile bid from Minorco SA, promisiBv to
pay its shareholders $2.2 billion in dividends if it doesn't meet
its own profit forecast.
   South African-based Minorco, whose offer values all of the
British mining group at about $5.4 billion, is trying to overturn a
U.S. court decision that threatens the bid. It would be Britain's
biggest takeover ever.
   A preliminary injunction arising from a U.S. antitrust suit
against Minorco blocks it from buying more than 30 percent of Gold
Fields' shares. The mining investment concern currently owns 29.6
percent of Gold Fields.
   Analysts generally expect Luxembourg-based Minorco to raise its
bid from its current cash and stock offer of $23.75 a share.
   Gold Fields shares rose 43 cents to finish at $22.92 on London's
Stock Exchange Tuesday. Minorco's shares fell 19 cents to $12.63.
   Gold Fields guaranteed shareholders more than 20 percent average
annual compound growth in earnings per share over the three years
ending in June 1992. If its target of $6.80 in cumulative earnings
per chare isn't met by the end of the 1992 fiscal year, then
shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $10.20 per
share, it said.
   Gold Fields has about 213 million shares outstanding.
   ``No British company has ever committed itself so firmly to
value for its shareholders,'' said Chairman Rudolph Agnew. ``Gold
Fields has both the assets and the management to see off Minorco
for good and our performance pledge is designed to ensure both
value today"and value tomorrow for all our shareholders.''
   ``Quite a major scheme of (corporate) restructuring woUld be
necessary'' to pay the special dividend, a company spokesman said.
This could involve such moves as a stock offering of part of Gold
Fields' highly profitable ARC construction aggregates business or
of its U.S.-based Gold Fields Mining Corp., said the spokesman, who
wasn't identified, in accordance with British custom.
   The spokesman added there weren't any immediate plans for sales.
   The special dividend payment would require approval of a
resolution by 51 percent of the shareholders authorizing the
company to issue special preferred stock free to existing holders
on a one-for-one basis.
   ``It's a phenomenal growth rate for any company to admit to,''
said John Willis, an analyst at Yamaichi International (Europe)
Ltd. ``It's a very, very clever move'' by Gold Fields in its bid
defense.
   The move could help determine the outcome of the takeover
battle, Willis said. Institutional shareholders in Gold Fields,
many of whom are already flush with cash, might reject Minorco's
offer in favor of a guaranteed realization of their gains over the
next three years, Willis said.
   Minorco said Gold Fields' latest defense wasn't relevant to the
takeover bid and ``will have no impact on our thinking.''

<HEAD>U.S. Farm Leader Calls For Protective Farm Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should write a 1990 farm bill on the
assumption that the European Economic Community will block any
chance of substantive progress for easing world agricultural trade
restrictions, a U.S. farm leader said Tuesday.
   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
said the new legislation should continue the current Export
Enhancement Program, which subsidizes the export sale of certain
U.S. agricultural commodities, particularly those that must compete
with subsidized EEC farm products.
   The Bush administration wants to see the outcome of the current
Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement of Tariffs and
Trade before there is a new farm bill. The current law, passed in
1985, will expire next year.
   Some want the 1985 law extended a year or two so that any GATT
settlement can be considered as new legislation is drafted.
   ``I don't think we should write a farm bill based on what we
hope will happen in the GATT talks,'' Kleckner told a news
conference.
   The United States and the 12-nation EEC are hung up mainly on
long-term strategy and by what U.S. negotiators insist are
distortions caused by certain subsidies and restrictive policies.
   But EEC officials claim there has been progress in overhauling
the community's policies and that the United States should
compromise on some of its goals _ which at one time called for the
gradual elimination of trade-distorting farm subsidies and rules.
   Negotiations resume Wednesday in Geneva under GATT auspices.
Meanwhile, U.S. and EEC officials say they have agreed on
``progressive substantial reductions'' in agricultural subsidies, a
phrase Kleckner said he doesn't understand at this point.
   Asked about EEC claims of already making progress in scaling
back some of its agricultural programs, Kleckner said he couldn't
see those actions have amounted to much.
   ``In the total context of world trade, it really hasn't been
anything at all,'' he said. ``And it hasn't done anything
long-term.''
   Kleckner said the Europeans ``must make changes if we are to
move toward more rational world agricultural trade'' but that the
EEC ``refuses to entertain that notion.''
   Although Kleckner said he was not giving up yet on the Uruguay
Round of negotiations _ it has about two years still remaining _ he
said there is some danger of agricultural issues taking a back seat
to other trade matters.
   One of the reasons agriculture got attention when the current
round began in Punta del Este, Uruguay, on Sept. 20, 1986, was the
skyrocketing costs of government farm programs operated by many
countries, including the EEC and United States, Kleckner said. Food
costs also were rising in some countries.
   But farm program costs have come down, partly as a result of
higher commodity prices fueled by last year's North American
drought _ and lower support prices ordered by the United States
under the 1985 farm law.
   ``There's no question that last year's drought and the resulting
higher commodity prices around the world took the pressure out of
agricultural talks in this round,'' Kleckner said. ``But droughts
are temporary, they come and go. And so, the long-term problem is
still out there.''

<HEAD>36 More Incidents Of Crossed Wiring, Plumbing Found On Boeing Planes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crossed wiring or plumbing problems in fire
warning and extinguishing systems have been found on 94 Boeing
jetliners, the Federal Aviation Administration said today.
   The FAA said none of the problems directly affected the planes'
airworthiness, and all were corrected before the aircraft returned
to service.
   On Jan. 31, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive ordering
U.S. operators of Boeing jets to inspect for possible wiring or
plumbing problems in fire warning and suppression systems in
aircraft engines and cargo holds.
   The directive was prompted by the discovery of 32 such problems
in previous checks of Boeing planes.
   Only U.S. operators were required to make the checks, but many
foreign carriers followed suit voluntarily. The FAA said that of
the 63 problems found since the directive was issued, 36 were
reported since the last update on March 10. Six were found on U.S.
aircraft and 57 on foreign planes. Two problems were found on one
aircraft, FAA spokesman David Duff said.
   Duff said the names of the foreign carriers would not be
released because they reported voluntarily and ``because we feel
that would hinder the future flow of information.''
   However, Air Canada has said it found wiring problems on two of
its 767s, Australian Airlines reported wrong connections on fire
extinguisher bottles on four of its 737s and Japanese television
network NHK reported last month that problems were found on 19 747s
and 767s operated by Japan Air Lines and All Nippon Airways.
   At the time of the March 10 FAA update, Boeing Co. officials
said they had found an engineering solution to prevent wiring
problems and were awaiting FAA approval for it.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Craig Martin said today
the engineering changes were undergoing final review at Boeing
before submission to the FAA for its approval. He said the changes
involve the wiring and plumbing connectors, to ``physically
differentiate the connectors so it will be much more difficult to
connect them improperly.''
   The initial cross-connection problems were reported about a year
ago. Since then, Boeing ``has made a lot of progress looking at our
assembly procedures in the factory and the functional tests in the
factories,'' Martin said.
   Boeing also is examining its maintenance manuals to see if
instructions need to be clarified and whether there is a need to
test the extinguisher and warning system functions when maintenance
is carried out, he said.
   Martin said ``in the vast majority'' of the problems reported,
the fire suppression systems still worked. Both the cargo hold and
engine fire extinguisher systems have backups.
   The FAA said today that 19 of the 63 problems were found in the
engine fire warning and supression systems. Of those, 10 were found
on 737-300s and 737-400s, three on 767s, five on 757s and one on a
747.
   Forty-four problems were found in cargo compartment fire warning
and extinguishing systems, including 30 on 747s, one on a 757 and
13 on 767s.
   The 32 problems found before the Jan. 31 directive was issued
involved 12 U.S. and 20 foreign aircraft. Eight of those involved
engine systems, including four on 737-300s and 737-400s, three on
757s and one on a 747. The remaining 24 involved cargo hold
systems: seven on 757s and 17 on 767s.
   The FAA said that of the total 95 problems, 68 concerned wiring,
with 24 such problems in engines and 44 in cargo compartments. The
remaining 27 were fire extinguisher plumbing problems, with three
in engines and 24 in cargo compartments. All the plumbing problems
were on 767s.

<DATELINE>CORNING, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corning Glass Works reported Tuesday that
profits were $41.8 million for the first quarter of 1989, a
turnaround from a $46.8 million loss for the same period in 1988.
   Last year's first-quarter loss was a result of an accounting
change in the way the company figured its retirees' medical
benefits. The change resulted in a charge of $83.9 million against
earnings in the first quarter of 1988.
   Excluding accounting changes and special credits from both
years, Corning's 1989 first-quarter earnings would have risen 12
percent to $41.8 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $36.8
million, or 41 cents a share.
   Sales for the first quarter, which ended March 26, of $534
million were up 18 from last year's first-quarter sales of $453
million, said Corning spokesman Stephen Albertalli.
   ``We continue to anticipate another record year,'' said Corning
Board Chairman James Houghton.
   Sales were up across the board, Albertalli said, and income from
jointly owned or partially owned companies rose 26 percent to a
record $17.7 million in the quarter.

<HEAD>New Budget Could Squeeze IRS Further, Congressional Auditors Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service, already cutting
activities, is likely to face another squeeze next year because
President Bush's IRS budget includes no money to enforce a new
anti-drug law and the ``taxpayer bill of rights,'' government
auditors said Tuesday.
   ``We question whether the administration has properly reflected
what IRS will need to assure adequate funding of its ongoing
activities in fiscal year 1990,'' Jennie Stathis, an associate
director of the General Accounting Office, told a House Ways and
Means subcommittee.
   ``This budget is a real friend of the deadbeats,'' said Rep.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., a member of the oversight subcommittee. ``The
folks who don't meet their tax obligations are going to experience
a diminished threat'' with fewer IRS auditors and collectors,
Dorgan said.
   He noted that while the budget would require a reduction in the
number of tax auditors, it anticipates fewer auditors will produce
more revenue.
   There is nothing in the new budget to help the IRS deal with the
new drug law; the ``bill of rights,'' which is designed to help
taxpayers involved in disputes with the IRS, or a new tax to
finance catastrophic-illness protection for older Americans, said
Michael J. Murphy, acting commissioner of internal revenue.
   When the agency outlined its needs for the coming year, IRS
asked that its budget be increased by $1.3 billion, in part to
reflect increased responsibilities under the new laws. That
increase was scaled back by the White House Office of Management
and Budget, which, instead, approved a raise of $289 million, to
$5.5 billion.
   ``I feel the 1990 budget does step us forward in tax
administration'' despite some shortcomings, Murphy told the
subcommittee. But in the meantime, he added, ``We are dealing with
Treasury and look forward to working with OMB to resolve those
differences.''
   Ms. Stathis said that although the budget for the current year
is $360 million less than IRS needs, ``IRS is functioning so far
without any significant disruption to its basic operations. We are
uncertain, however, what lies in store for the rest of 1989.''
   In scaling back operations, the IRS vowed not to reduce
assistance to taxpayers or slow processing of returns. The agency
is reducing travel, training and purchases of computers and
supplies. A hiring freeze was imposed for most occupations.
   Robert M. Tobias, president of the National Treasury Employees
Union, which represents most IRS workers, said IRS enforcement has
suffered to the extent that in just six months the government has
lost $1 billion in revenues that it otherwise would have collected.
Another $1 billion will be lost by October unless the IRS is given
more money, he added.
   This year's squeeze was caused, GAO said, because of a mandated
4.1 percent increase in employee pay, higher postal rates and a
rise in premiums for workers' health insurance and pensions.
   GAO, an arm of Congress, said the IRS budget for next year is
suspect because it fails to include some costs, including the
anti-drug law and the taxpayer bill of rights, while anticipating
savings that are questionable. The latter was a reference to OMB
projections that the IRS can save a considerable amount of money by
having private contractors, rather than federal workers, do certain
jobs.
   The IRS, which has been under intense criticism because its
workers incorrectly answer taxpayers' telephoned questions about 30
percent of the time, was criticized by GAO for spending $57 million
this budget year trying to improve that record.
   ``Although the initiative is important ... IRS' decision to fund
it and other initiatives in 1989 added to the budgetary problems in
other parts of the agency,'' Ms. Stathis said.

   Futures prices for corn and soybeans were higher
but wheat prices were down at the close Tuesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   The market's direction has been generally downward during past
several sessions.
   ``People walked in this morning and said it had been oversold,
and there was some European trade in the soymeal market,'' said
assistant vice president Cathy Leow of Thompson McKinnon Securities
Inc.
   Wheat was being sold largely because of profit-taking after
Monday's closing rally and the lack of confirmation of rumors
concerning a big sale to China, research director Jerry Gidel of
LIT America Inc. said.
   Corn was being supported by the sale Monday of 450,000 metric
tons of corn to the Soviet Union, he added.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 6 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.02{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents
to 2{ cents higher, with May at $2.61{ a bushel; oats were 2 cents
to 3\ cents higher, with May at $1.89} a bushel; and soybeans were

   Stock prices pulled back slightly today as the
market relinguished some of the gains from Monday's moderate
advance.
   Analysts said in the early going trading lacked direction due to
the absence of any new developments on the economic or takeover
fronts and the market meandered in a narrow range.
   As the session continued, weakness in technology issues weighed
down the market and share prices headed down.
   Jack Barbanel, a senior vice president at Gruntal &amp; Co. Inc.,
said buying in the stock market subsided today with traders sorting
through a range of previously disclosed takeover news.
   ``The market seems to be in somewhat of a holding pattern,''
said Barbanel, adding that Wall Street may remain subdued this week
awaiting Friday's release of U.S. employment statistics.
   The Labor Department's employment report for March will furnish
a fresh indication of how much the economy is responding to the
Federal Reserve's efforts to slow growth and diffuse inflationary
pressures.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's Third World debt
initiative won key endorsements Tuesday from the two international
agencies expected to implement the strategy, with officials from
both groups pledging quick action to get debt relief underway.
   Both Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the 151-nation
International Monetary Fund, and Barber Conable, president of the
other global lending organization, the World Bank, said they
recognized the need for urgency in addressing the debt crisis.
   Conable said that any delay ``could be devastating in view of
the expectancies which have been created'' about the prospect for a
reduction in the $1.3 trillion level of Third World debt.
   In a speech to the final session of the spring meetings of the
IMF and the World Bank, Conable said the bank had created a joint
task force to work with the IMF to speed implementation of the new
debt relief program.
   Earlier, the top policy board of the IMF issued a communique
endorsing the general principles embodied in the debt program
unveiled by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on March 10.
   The approval was seen as critical since the administration is
counting on most of the financing for the debt relief scheme to
come from the two lending agencies. The Brady plan seeks to resolve
the debt crisis by encouraging commercial banks to cancel
voluntarily a portion of the loans they have made to Third World
countries in return for assurances from the IMF and World Bank of
repayment on the remaining debt.
   The administration projects cutting the debt of 39 major debtor
nations by 20 percent over the next three years with financing of
about $12 billion each from the IMF and the World Bank.
   IMF and World Bank officials refused to discuss specific dollar
amounts on Tuesday, saying that much will depend on how many
countries adopt the economic reforms which will be necessary to
qualify for the debt relief.
   A U.S. Treasury Department official, who spoke on condition that
his name not be used, said it was likely that the Philippines would
be the first country to qualify for debt relief. Mexico and
Venezuela also have been mentioned as early candidates for
assistance.
   Camdessus told reporters at a briefing that the IMF recognized
the need to move quickly to spell out just how the debt relief will
work in order to remove uncertainty in on-going negotiations
between debtor countries and creditors.
   ``Nothing is worse than uncertainty,'' he said. ``The sooner we
can assemble a program and provide answers, the better the chance
for success.''
   One reason for urgency is the growing political turmoil in many
emerging democracies in Latin America stemming from the debt burden
and the stagnation in living standards in the region. Riots left at
least 270 dead in Venezuela in February after the government
imposed new debt austerity measures.
   The spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank had been
considered a critical launching pad for the new Brady plan. Brady
laid the groundwork for approval by gaining the endorsement of the
leading industrial countries for the debt relief strategy at a
daylong negotiating session on Sunday.
   The statement by the IMF interim committee contained much of the
same language as the Sunday communique issued by the United States,
Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy.
   In another favorable development this week, Japan pledged to
loan up to $4.5 billion to developing nations over the next several
years, a commitment that is viewed as critical since the flow of
commercial bank lending has been drying up.
   The administration did not get everything it sought. The IMF
steering group, because of objections from the British in
particular, refused to endorse a U.S. proposal to use IMF and World
Bank funds to guarantee interest payments on the debt as well as
the reduced amounts of principal.
   The British and some other countries had objected that the more
costly interest-rate guarantees represented little more than a
bailout to commercial banks who had made the loans.
   The IMF steering group promised to ``examine'' the question of
interest rate subsidies. Dutch Finance Minister H. Onno Ruding,
chairman of the IMF steering committee, said that the language of
the final statement did not mean the idea was dead, only that the
finance ministers needed to know more details of how such
guarantees would work.
   Brady, in a speech prepared for the closing session of the joint
IMF-World Bank development committee, said the administration would
continue pushing for guarantees on both the reduced debt and the
interest payments.
   ``We believe it is essential to establish both support
mechanisms in order to provide adequate impetus'' for the banks to
cancel a portion of the debt, Brady said.
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy told reporters that the
Venezuelan riots had been an ``alarm signal'' showing more needed
to be done to address the 7-year-old debt crisis. He predicted the
debt issue would be a prime topic on the agenda when President Bush
attends his first economic summit in Paris in July.

   Oil prices headed higher in brisk trading
Tuesday, with crude rising above the $20-a-barrel level and
unleaded gasoline gaining more than a penny a gallon.
   Analysts attributed the rally to a variety of factors, including
expectations of a bullish weekly trade report on oil supplies due
to the Alaskan oil spill and bargaining hunting following Monday's
partial selloff.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled 47
cents higher Tuesday at $20.42 a barrel. The contract had lost 24
cents on Monday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Tuesday,
the May contract for unleaded gasoline jumped 1.61 cents to close
at 69.46 cents a gallon, after gaining 0.88 cent Monday.
   May wholesale home heating oil, which lost 0.62 cent at the
start of the week, settled at 53.64 cents, up 0.89 cent.
   Andrew Lebow, an energy analyst with E.D.F. Man International
Futures Inc., said traders were anticipating a dropoff in oil
supplies when the American Petroleum Institute releases its latest
weekly report.
   ``Most traders expect sharp draw-downs in crude inventory due to
the Alaskan situation,'' he said.
   Oil prices have risen sharply since a massive oil spill by an
Exxon Corp. tanker at the Valdez, Alaska, port. The Alaskan
pipeline there carries nearly one-quarter of the United States'
domestic supply of crude oil.
   Adding support to the market Tuesday, Lebow said, were reports
that the U.S. Coast Guard would continue to restrict tanker
activity at Valdez.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls While Gold Prices are Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued to decline Tuesday amid
more signs that the major industrial nations want to bring the U.S.
currency lower.
   Meanwhile, gold prices were narrowly mixed. Republic National
Bank of New York reported a bid of $385.90 for a troy ounce of gold
as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $385.80 late Monday.
   The dollar fell largely because of central bank intervention,
which has squelched the currency's upward move for the time being,
said Dan Holland, a vice president at Discount Corp.
   The central banks, in response to requests from the big
industrial countries, sold dollars over several sessions last week
and again Monday and Tuesday to bring the dollar down.
   European dealers said the dollar fell Tuesday in response to
comments by French Economic Minister Pierre Beregovoy concerning
the Group of Seven's agreement that the dollar should not rise or
excessively decline.
   Officials from the seven countries _ the United States, Britain,
France, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada _ discussed the
foreign exchange markets during a meeting last weekend in
Washington.
   Traders in the United States were also following foreign
interest rate movements closely. Overseas interest rate hikes are
bearish for the dollar because they make other currencies more
attractive.
   Holland said the dollar might stabilize if Japan and West
Germany do not raise their interest rates.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7043 late Tuesday, more
expensive for buyers than Monday's late $1.6855. In later New York
trading, the pound rose to $1.7085 from $1.6912 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.86835 West German marks, down from 1.87625;
1.63075 Swiss francs, down from 1.64125; 6.3060 French francs, down
from 6.3300; 1,370.375 Italian lire, down from 1,376.625; and
1.18655 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18755.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Monday's
late rates, included: 1.8670 West German marks, down from 1.8835;
1.6358 Swiss francs, down from 1.6488; 6.3100 French francs, down
from 6.3535; 2.1080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1230; 1,372.75
Italian lire, down from 1,381.50; 1.1875 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1896.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar dropped to 131.05 Japanese yen from
132.26. In London late Tuesday the dollar traded lower at 130.95
yen, and in New York, it fell to 130.85 yen from 131.775 late
Monday.
   Gold dipped to $386.10 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in
New York from late Monday's $386.20.
   Bullion was up more than $1 overseas. Gold traded late in
London, the major market, at a bid $386.75 a troy ounce, up from
$385.30 late Monday, while the Zurich late bid price was $386.50,
up from $385.25.
   Traders said that as anxiety about inflation was easing, the
dollar's weakness would not help gold much.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $387.25 bid, up from
$385.75.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.84 a troy ounce, up
from $5.80.
   On the Commodity Exchange, silver rose to $5.816 a troy ounce
from $5.788 late Monday.

<HEAD>Farley Extends Tender Offer For West Point-Pepperell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST POINT, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farley Inc. said Tuesday it hoped to
complete its $1.8 billion acquisition of West Point-Pepperell Inc.
later this week after extending its tender offer for another 21
hours.
   Pepperell shareholders had until 9 p.m. Tuesday to redeem their
stock at Farley's offer of $58 a share. The offer previously was
scheduled to expire at midnight Monday.
   Meanwhile, Farley officials were hoping their acquisition of the
Georgia textile giant would be completed by Thursday. That deadline
has twice been extended as Farley needed extra time to make
arrangements to complete the deal.
   ``It's a very big transaction,'' a Farley spokesman, who asked
not to be identified, said Tuesday. ``When you buy a car, it takes
some time. When you buy a house, it takes some time. When you buy a
West Point-Pepperell, it takes some time.''
   Josie Esquivel, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, said some
junk bond investors are concerned that Farley, the maker of Fruit
of the Loom underwear, was paying too much for Pepperell.
   But Wall Street investors indicated confidence that Farley will
complete the takeover. The textile company's stock rose 12{ cents
to $57.87{ per share in trading Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Farley officials would not comment on speculation Monday that it
was considering selling Fruit of the Loom, but the company has said
it is not having difficulty raising $1.8 billion for the deal.
   Farley has proposed financing the buyout with bank debt and junk
bonds.
   Pepperell, which manufactures Martex and Lady Pepperell sheet
and towels, Arrow shirts and Gold Toe socks, is the nation's
largest publicly held textile and apparel maker. It has about 29.8
million shares outstanding, including nearly 2.9 million shares
already owned by Farley.

   Futures prices for coffee surged higher Tuesday on the lack of
bad news from the International Coffee Organization meetings in
London this week.
   On other futures markets, corn and soybeans were higher while
wheat prices fell, frozen pork bellies were off sharply while
livestock was mixed, and most energy products were higher.
   The volatile May coffee contract rose more than 320 points
during the session to over $1.31 a pound _ its highest level since
March 20 _ on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
   ``There is now a perception of a compromise on quotas to replace
the accord that expires Sept. 30. The sentiment for months was that
there would be no ageement,'' said analyst Sandra Kaul of Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Also supporting prices were continued good demand,
behind-schedule shipments and forecasts for a reduced Brazilan
coffee harvest, she said.
   Coffee settled .50 cent to 3.25 cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in May at $1.3148 a pound.
   Futures prices for corn and soybeans were higher but wheat
prices were down at the close Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market's direction has been generally downward during past
several sessions.
   ``People walked in this morning and said it had been oversold,
and there was some European trade in the soymeal market,'' said
assistant vice president Cathy Leow of Thompson McKinnon Securities
Inc.
   Wheat was being sold largely because of profit-taking after
Monday's closing rally and the lack of confirmation of rumors
concerning a big sale to China, research director Jerry Gidel of
LIT America Inc. said.
   Wheat settled 1 cents to 7\ cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.01\ a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 3 cents
higher, with May at $2.62 a bushel; oats were \ cent to 2 cents
higher, with May at $1.88 a bushel; and soybeans were 2} cents to 6
cents higher, with May at $7.14} a bushel.
   Futures prices for frozen pork bellies were off sharply while
livestock prices were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork bellies were depressed by record high storage supplies and
high retail prices, said Tom O'Hare of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co.
   Supply concerns also kept prices uncertain for cattle and live
hogs, he said.
   Cattle settled .43 cent lower to .15 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in April at 77.55 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were unchanged to .30 cent lower, with April at 79.50 a
pound; live hogs were .50 cent lower to .28 cent higher, with April
at 40.65 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to 2
cents lower, with May at 34.77 a pound.
   Most energy prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Analysts attributed the rally to several factors, including
expectations of a bullish weekly trade report on tight oil supplies
due to the Alaskan oil spill and bargain-hunting following Monday's
partial selloff.
   Crude oil settled 22 cents to 47 cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in May at $20.42 a barrel; heating oil was .40 cent to
.89 cent higher, with May at 53.64 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was .33 cent lower to 1.61 cents higher, with May at 69.46
cents a gallon.
   Precious metals prices were generally steady on the Commodity
Exchange in New York.
   The market has become uncertain about the movement of the U.S.
dollar and the outcome of inflationary pressures, said John Jonat
of Deak International Inc.
   Gold settled unchanged to 20 cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in April at $386.10 a troy ounce; and silver was 2.2 cents
to 2.8 cents higher, with April at $5.81.6 a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
   A socialite art collector who tormented her
stockbroker by telephoning him 1,208 times in one week has pleaded
guilty to aggravated harassment, been fined and ordered not to
contact the man for three years.
   Ethel Scull, 67, claimed she lost thousands of dollars in the
October 1987 stock market crash by following tips of broker Charles
Lewis, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. vice president. But
prosecutors said Lewis helped Mrs. Scull make $300,000 months
before the crash by putting her money into government bonds. They
said Mrs. Scull made the calls during a week in January 1988,
including one day when she telephoned him 485 times.
   She was arrested on harassment charges Feb. 1 and failed to keep
a court date Feb. 28. A warrant was issued for her arrest.
   After she surrendered and pleaded guilty Monday to aggravated
assault charges, Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Renee White fined
her $1,000 plus $60 in court costs and ordered her not to call,
write or go near Lewis for three years.
   Mrs. Scull, formerly married to taxi entrepreneur Robert Scull,
was awarded art works worth millions of dollars in her divorce
settlement in 1974. Her collection included pieces by Jasper Johns
and Andy Warhol.

<HEAD>FCC To Permit British Telecom's Purchase Of McCaw Shares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Tuesday said it would not stand in the way of British
Telecommunications Inc.'s $1.5 billion investment in McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc., the nation's biggest cellular phone company.
   The FCC said the purchase of a 22.4 percent share of McCaw did
not involve a transfer of control of McCaw to British Telecom USA
and it also was in line with federal restrictions on foreign
involvement in U.S. broadcasting or common carrier companies.
   Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, said the
1934 Communications Act limits foreign stakes in U.S.
communications companies to either 20 percent or 25 percent,
depending on whether the U.S. concern has direct or indirect
control of broadcast licenses.
   He said McCaw does not hold licenses directly, but rather
controls them through wholly owned subsidiaries. Thus he said the
25 percent limit applies.
   British Telecom will gain control of four of the 19 seats on
McCaw's board and acquire 22.4 percent of its stock.
   The deal is the largest yet for the fledgling cellular industry,
according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.
   The CTIA said McCaw was cash-strapped and had reported net
losses of $92.2 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1988.
   The McCaw family and management holds a 41 percent equity in the
company, and board chairman Craig McCaw will maintain majority
control of electing directors, Brock said.
   McCaw owns subsidiaries which in turn hold interests in
cellular, paging and other areas of radio communications.
   British Telecom USA is the wholly owned subsidiary of British
Telecom, a publicly held corporation that is 49 percent owned by
the British government.

   Stock prices pulled back in moderate trading
Tuesday, relinguishing some of the market's recent gains.
   The market meandered in a narrow range in early trading before
turning lower in the afternoon, partly weighed down by weakness in
technology stocks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 6.60 to 2,298.20.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
838 down, 643 up and 491 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 160.68 million
shares, down from 164.66 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 187.21 million shares.
   A decline in the dollar against other foreign currencies
depressed stocks.
   Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany Corp., said
stocks and bonds had benefited from the dollar's recent strength on
the theory that a higher dollar would bolster the confidence of
foreign investors and attract capital from overseas into U.S.
financial markets.
   Another negative influence on stocks was the announcement by
several companies involved in takeovers that they were taking
defensive measures.
   ``The market seems to be in somewhat of a holding pattern,''
said Jack Barbanel, a senior vice president at Gruntal &amp; Co. Inc.,
adding that Wall Street may remain subdued this week, awaiting
Friday's release of U.S. employment statistics.
   The Labor Department's employment report for March will furnish
a fresh indication of how much the economy is responding to the
Federal Reserve's efforts to slow growth and diffuse inflationary
pressures.
   Within the technology group, Tandem Computers said its earnings
for the quarter ended March 31 would fall short of expectations.
The estimate, which helped push Tandem's stock to 14~, off 2[ in
active trading, followed disappointing forecasts from other
computer manufacturers, including IBM, Digital and Unisys.
   Elsewhere in the technology sector, IBM was down 1] to 107[ and
Digital lost 1| to 96\.
   Smithkline Beckman led the active list for much of the session
and finished up \ at 65~. The stock was a strong performer Monday
also amid speculation that a rival bid may emerge for the drug
company following its disclosure that it is planning to merge some
of its major operations with Britain's Beecham.
   Lockheed shares fell 2 to 47} on news the company estimated a 40
percent drop in its first-quarter net income and foresees an
earnings decline in 1989.
   The company said it would issue 10.5 million new shares and buy
back the same number of shares in the creation of a $500 million
employee stock ownership plan. An investor group led by Harold
Simmons, which Monday said it had acquired a 5.3 percent stake in
Lockheed, said Lockheed's reorganization plans are discouraging the
group from increasing its stake for the time being.
   Tribune Co. skidded 3{ to 44{. The company has been a target a
takeover talk recently and Tuesday said it was selling $350 million
of convertible preferred stock to its ESOP and would use the
proceeds to repurchase up to 8 million common shares.
   NWA Inc. slid | to 83}. The parent of Northwest Airlines has
received a $90-a-share bid from investor Marvin Davis.
   Burlington Resources, which has been the subject of takeover
speculation, gained 1[ to 50[.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $6.483 billion, or 0.22
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped 0.48 to 165.95.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index dropped 1.15 to 340.14, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.08 at 295.31.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.47 to 407.18. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 329.19, off 0.28.

   Albert E. Suter resigned Tuesday as
Whirlpool Corp.'s president and chief operating officer, a post he
held for seven months, to pursue other opportunities, the appliance
maker said.
   David R. Whitwam, the chairman and chief executive, said William
D. Marohn, 49, president of the company's Kenmore Appliance Group,
was named an executive vice president and given Suter's
responsibilities for North American appliance operations.
   ``As much as I value my relationship and experience with
Whirlpool, I now fully realize my career interests are to pursue
CEO or entrepreneurial opportunities,'' Suter said in a news
release from Whirlpool.
   A CEO post at Whirlpool would be unlikely, Suter said when
reached in Chicago, where he lives. ``I had never anticipated the
CEO post opening up,'' the 53-year-old Suter said. ``Mr. Whitwam
(at 47) is younger than I am.''
   He declined to comment on the brevity of his stay at Whirlpool.
``Dave Whitwam and I complemented each other very well,'' he said.
   Suter was previously vice chairman of Emerson Electric Co., a
major supplier of appliance components to Whirlpool and other
companies.
   He was named Whirlpool's president and chief operating officer
in September, assuming the title of president from Whitwam, who is
expected to seek the board's approval to regain the title of
president, Whirlpool spokeswoman Carol Sizer said.
   Marohn has been president of the Kenmore Appliance Group since
February 1988.
   Whirlpool reported earnings of $94.1 million on sales of $4.31
billion in 1988. It became the world's largest appliance concern
with a January agreement to purchase a majority of the appliance
division of NV Philips of the Netherlands.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Connecticut investment broker allegedly bilked
his clients out of more than $1.5 million by keeping their money
for his personal use rather than investing it, federal authorities
charged Tuesday.
   According to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the broker,
William S. Hoglund, 47, of Greenwich, Conn., told relatives,
friends and others that ``investments he would make on their behalf
would be low risk, liquid and highly lucrative.''
   However, the SEC said, in a scheme that began in December 1986,
Hoglund made few investments, and instead deposited his clients'
money into three accounts he kept at Citibank.
   At least 22 investors residing in four states invested about
$1.8 million with Hoglund. The SEC refused to name the states.
   According to court papers, ``after persistent requests or
lawsuits'' Hoglund returned about $250,000 to several investors.
However, investors have been unable to get approximately $1,560,000
from Hoglund.
   ``Investors found it difficult and sometimes impossible to get
all or part of their investments back. Hoglund evaded, deceived and
made misrepresentations to investors regarding the return of their
funds,'' the complaint said.
   Hoglund's attorney, Joel M. Lutwin, said his client would have
no comment on the SEC complaint.
   However, according to the court papers, Hoglund told a meeting
of his clients in November 1987 that he had not invested their
money as promised.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa issued a temporary
restraining order on Tuesday freezing Hoglund's assets and ordering
him to stop accepting money from investors. Griesa scheduled a
hearing on the matter for April 14.
   According to the SEC, Hoglund presented himself to investors as
a top executive of Capital Alaska Inc. or H-H Capital Corp. and
said he had seats on several stock exchanges.

<HEAD>Administration Says It Opposes Any Move to Close Alaska Pipeline</HEAD>

   The Bush administration said Tuesday it would
oppose any move to close the Alaska pipeline but acknowledged it
was unclear whether the federal government has legal authority to
prevent it.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the authority
issue was ``an open question.'' However, he said, ``I don't
honestly believe anybody wants to close the pipeline.''
   Environmental Protection Administrator William Reilly,
meanwhile, told Congress that the massive Alaskan oil spill could
put the brakes on petroleum exploration there and in other areas _
at least temporarily.
   ``We will take apart the environmental planning for every aspect
of oil development in Alaska and in other sensitive areas where the
environment potentially could be threatened,'' Reilly told a House
appropriations subcommittee.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper has threatened to shut the pipeline
unless Exxon and other oil companies produce a better plan to deal
with oil spills such as the one that dumped 10-million gallons in
Prince William Sound on March 24. Democratic and Republican state
legislators have backed up Cowper.
   At the White House, Fitzwater said, ``We've seen those comments
(by Cowper) but we simply don't think it would be in the national
interest to close the pipeline.
   ``We need to be aware of environmental precautions and
safeguards that can and should be taken as a result of this
incident but we remind people that the pipeline supplies 25 percent
of our daily domestic oil production or one-eighth of our daily
consumption,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``And while we share his environmental concerns we would not
anticipate closing the pipeline.''
   The press secretary said no consideration had been given to the
idea of Bush going to Alaska for a firsthand look at the
environmental damage from the spill.
   Reilly assured Congress the administration will thoroughly
review environmental safeguards in areas under consideration for
oil exploration.
   ``We are doing that, as you know, off the coast of California
and the coast of Florida ... We'll do it in Prince William Sound
and look very carefully at future contingency planning there and
we'll do it on the north slope,'' he said.
   ``I think we owe that to the environment, Reilly added. ``We owe
that to common sense.''
   Asked if the administration would hold up exploration of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge pending completion of the review,
Reilly said, ``There is a very clear understanding that we will not
move forward if we have any significant concerns that have not been
resolved.''
   Reilly was called to testify before the House Appropriations
subcommittee on independent agencies about the EPA's budget but the
committee first grilled him about the Alaska oil spill.
   Acknowledging a lack of adequate precautions for such an
accident, Reilly said, ``The contingency plan itself was not
adequate to anticipate, contemplate, prepare for and respond to a
spill of this magnitude. It was not.
   ``There's no question about that but ... the response was not
adequate, either,'' he said.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Tuesday he has asked Bush
to assign administration officials to gather scientific information
from other countries that have experienced large oil spills so
residents of Valdez know what to expect in the future.
   In another indication of the economic impact the spill will have
on fisherman, Murkowski said Japanese buyers of Alaskan seafood
have said they will not make purchases this year from the Prince
William area.
   Earlier, Alaskan officials announced that the herring fishing
season in the sound would be cancelled this year.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, meanwhile, criticized
Bush for choosing to not impose a federal takeover on the cleanup.
He also introduced legislation that would require the government to
clean up oil spills unless the company involved was doing an
effective job of dealing with the accident.
   ``Within a few days after the spill occurred, it was clear that
the clean-up effort was inadequate,'' Mitchell said. ``Valuable
time _ the most valuable time _ was lost.''
   In other legislative action, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
introduced a bill that would give the Coast Guard access to the
Federal National Driver Register so that it can check the driving
records of prospective oil tanker pilots for drunk driving
convictions. Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood was fired and
charged with being drunk at the time of the accident.

motion to transfer its Chapter 11 case from New York to Houston.
   Dallas-based MCorp filed the petition Friday.
   As previously reported, MCorp said in a statement it intends to

   Exxon crews Tuesday finished pumping the
remaining crude oil out of the tanker Exxon Valdez in preparation
for refloating and removing the source of the nation's worst-ever
oil spill.
   The fugitive captain of the Exxon Valdez sent signals he was
ready to surrender to face criminal charges of operating the vessel
while drunk.
   Meanwhile, Exxon said placing an oil-catching boom around the
ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant
explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the reason
it took 11 hours to set the first containment line.
   ``The worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom
the vessel. We would have lost the vessel,'' said Exxon Shipping
Co. President Frank Iarossi.
   A boom wasn't placed around the vessel for 11 hours because it
wasn't available in Valdez, Exxon officials have said.
   Iarossi also said Exxon has changed its policy because of the
spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is
prohibited, four hours before sailing. Authorities charged the
captain had been drinking before the Valdez sailed.
   Thick oil has floated over more than 1,640 square miles and
soiled 800 miles of beach. Thousands of animals are known dead,
including 30 sea otters.
   Early Tuesday, Exxon said it had finished transferring about 42
million gallons of crude to three other ships. Another 42 million
gallons of oily waste water remained aboard the Valdez, which
spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude into Prince William
Sound when it struck a reef March 24.
   The company said crews would attempt to pump air into the hold
and refloat the vessel off a reef at high tide Wednesday afternoon.
If freed, the still-leaking ship, which has eight holes some 20
feet long in its hull, will be towed to a remote and already fouled
cove for repairs.
   Exxon then planned to take the ship to a port in the Far East,
or to a Portland, Ore., dry dock. Port officials there said they
weren't sure if they'd allow that, even though the $12 million
repair bill would provide about 200 jobs.
   ``We're not willing to trade in the environment for jobs,''
Portland port spokesman Darrel Buttice said Monday.
   Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt said Tuesday there are ``a lot of
questions that need to be answered'' before the Valdez is allowed
in.
   Canadian authorities also asked Exxon for assurances there will
be no damage to the British Columbia coast if the tanker is towed
to Oregon, and the mayor of Valdez said the ship was not welcome
back in the port where it took on the load of crude.
   In Washington, Environmental Protection Administrator William
Reilly said the spill could put the brakes on petroleum exploration
there and in other areas. ``We will take apart the environmental
planning for every aspect of oil development in Alaska and in other
sensitive areas where the environment potentially could be
threatened,'' he told a House appropriations subcommittee.
   The family of the fired Exxon Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood,
said the skipper wants to surrender but is awaiting advice from his
attorney, according to Lt. Thomas Fazio, commander of the New York
State Police on Long Island.
   But after Long Island law enforcement authorities waited a
second day for Hazelwood to turn himself in, the Suffolk County
district attorney's office announced there would be no surrender
that day.
   Hazelwood, 42, is accused operating the ship while under the
influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge
of oil. Bail was previously set in Valdez at $50,000.
   Of about three dozen oil-soaked otters rescued following the
spill, about one-third have died, Alaska Department of Fish and
Game spokesman Jon Lyman said. ``Dozens of otters are dying before
rescuers can get to them,'' he said. Six otters were flown to Sea
World in San Diego on Monday for rehabilitation.
   Fishermen counting on the sound's $12 million annual herring
industry were told Monday by the state that it will not allow a
season this year. Sablefish and shrimp fisheries in Prince William
waters also have been closed.
   An effort at Sawmill Bay, 11 miles west of Valdez, to keep oil
away from a hatchery where 2 million salmon are waiting to be
released to the sea appeared to be failing. Tendrils of oil had
floated past a boom streched across the bay, said officials.
   The spill has shifted public opinion in Alaska about the energy
industry, which has been lobbying for new exploration.
   U.S. Sen. Frank Murkowski, a champion of oil exploration in
Alaska, asked that plans for drilling in Bristol Bay, the state's
richest fishing grounds, be set aside until the industry can
demonstrate that it can respond effectively to spills.
   ``The Exxon Valdez accident has taught us that simply having a
plan is not sufficient,'' the Alaska Republican said.
   At the first Valdez City Council meeting since the spill, two
council members and Mayor John Devens expressed concern that anger
and frustration over the spill was surfacing as harrassment of
pipeline company workers and their children.
   Meanwhile, a multimillion-dollar class-action lawsuit was filed
Monday in federal court in California against Exxon Corp., charging
that the spill has led to gas prices of 10 to 15 cents more a
gallon for California drivers.

<HEAD>Oil Flow Returning To Normal In Trans-Alaska Pipeline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline
was increased again Tuesday and will return to its normal daily
level of 2.1 million barrels Wednesday, Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co. said.
   Flow through the pipeline had been cut by 60 percent because of
restrictions on tanker travel through Valdez harbor after the Exxon
Valdez accident.
   Alyeska spokeswoman Beverly Michaels said tankers may now handle
the normal load even though some Coast Guard travel restrictions
are still in effect.
   ``Inventory is very low, so we still have storage (in Valdez) to
handle it,'' Ms. Michaels said. ``And we are able to bring in
enough tankers.''
   The Coast Guard on Monday restricted traffic to daytime hours
only, and required a two-tug escort for tankers. In addition, only
one tanker at a time is allowed to pass through the area.
   Valdez is the only port from which North Slope oil is shipped.
The reductions have caused West Coast refinery shortages and higher
oil prices.
   The Coast Guard said Valdez averages three tankers a day, and
``we're not too far away from that.''

   Cathay Pacific Airways announced Tuesday that it
has placed a firm order with Airbus Industrie for 10 A330-300
aircraft and has taken options on another 10 of the wide-body
planes.
   The firm order is worth about $1.1 billion, and if all the
options are exercised, the order would total about $2.2 billion,
the Hong Kong airline said.
   The first of the planes will be delivered in January 1995, with
delivery scheduled to be completed in 1997.
   The purchase is the largest single Airbus order by a Far Eastern
airline, Cathay Pacific said. Airbus Industrie is a European
aircraft-making consortium sponsored by the governments of Britain,
France, West Germany and Spain.
   ``This huge investment demonstrates Cathay Pacific's commitment
to Hong Kong and our confidence in the territory up to and beyond
1997,'' Cathay Pacific Chairman David Gledhill said, referring to
the year when Hong Kong is scheduled to change from a British
colony to part of mainland China.
   ``It also reflects our confidence in continued growth in the
marketplace in Hong Kong and the Asian region.''

   The federal judge overseeing the Eastern
Airlines bankruptcy case ordered the U.S. trustee in the case late
Tuesday to show cause why he has postponed the appointment of a
bankruptcy examiner.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland ordered U.S. trustee Harold
Jones to explain at a hearing Wednesday why Jones postponed the
naming of an examiner Tuesday at the request of Eastern and a
committee representing its unsecured creditors.
   The order was highly unusual for a bankruptcy case, said Nancy
Lazar, Lifland's law clerk.
   Lifland, who is overseeing Eastern's Chapter 11 reorganization,
recently ordered appointment of an examiner with unusually broad
powers, including a mandate to mediate the bitter labor dispute at
the carrier in an effort to get it flying again.
   Jones, who is responsible for administration of the Eastern
bankruptcy case, declined to say in a telephone interview earlier
Tuesday why the company and creditors had asked for a deferral of
the examiner appointment.
   However, union sources speculated that Eastern and the committee
wished to postpone the appointment until U.S. District Judge Edward
B. Davis in Miami rules on Eastern's request that he declare a
walkout by its pilots an illegal strike and order them back to
work. Davis' decision is expected sometime this week.
   The pilots' walkout in support of a Machinists strike that began
March 4 has been crucial to the success of the strike and has
forced the airline to sharply curtail its flight schedules.
Eastern's flight attendants union also is honoring the strike.
   Jones had said the naming of an examiner to be appointed by
Lifland could be made Wednesday or later. He was unavailable for
comment late Tuesday after the judge issued his order.
   Miami-based Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection in the New
York court on March 9 due to a cash crisis created by the strike.
   Jones said ``substantial progress'' was made at a meeting
Tuesday between Eastern and the 15-member unsecured creditors
committee, which also includes representatives of Eastern's pilots
and Machinists unions and its non-union workers, but he declined to
elaborate.
   The creditors committee had requested potential buyers for
Eastern, including hotel executive Jay Pritzker and a group led by
ex-baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth, to present their
proposals at its Tuesday meeting.
   Little was immediately known of developments at the closed-door
creditors committee meeting at a Manhattan law firm. Lifland had
asked members of the committee not to discuss developments at the
meeting with the news media, according to people familiar with the
proceedings who asked not to be identified.
   The Ueberroth group made a $464 million bid to acquire Eastern
but withdrew it last week after the airline's parent Texas Air
Corp. indicated it had received a higher offer.
   The group planned a revised, lower offer, that reflecting
developer Donald Trump's new agreement to buy Eastern's prized
Northeast shuttle for $365 million, sources close to Ueberroth said.
   Pritzker, former head of Braniff Airlines has offered around
$500 million for the whole airline, according to sources close to
the situation.
   America West Airlines, which has expressed is interested in
buying Boeing 757s and the shuttle's landing slots in New York and
Washington from Eastern, said it still considers itself a potential
buyer.
   The regional airline is not in discussions with Eastern but it
is watching developments closely, said Daphne Dicino, a spokeswoman
for Phoenix-based America West who was visiting New York. She said
America West believes it still could bid for the shuttle because
the sale to Trump hasn't yet been approved by the bankruptcy court.
   Trump said Friday he expected the deal to be closed within 60
days.
   The creditors panel has the right to review any reorganization
plan proposed by Eastern and can propose its own plan to the
bankruptcy judge.
   In a separate development, Houston-based Texas Air announced
that it would not pay dividends for the first quarter on its four
outstanding issues of preferred stock. The dividends would have
been payable on March 31, April 15 and April 30, depending on the
issue, the airline holding company said.
   Also Tuesday, Lifland approved Eastern's sale of three Boeing
727-100s to Federal Express Corp. for a total of about $10.8
million, Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said in Miami.
   The sale fulfills an accord signed last September in which
Eastern agreed to sell 10 of the planes to Federal Express. Matell
said the first seven were delivered between September and February.
   In Washington, Congressional Democrats pulled off the Senate
floor legislation that would require President Bush to appoint an
emergency board to recommend a solution to the walkout.
   The Democratic lawmakers attributed their reversal to a desire
to give potential buyers a chance to acquire Eastern and to allow
the bankruptcy court to find a way to end the walkout.
   Bush and congressional Republicans have opposed the measure,
saying the carrier's management and unions should work out their
dispute privately. Bush had threatened to veto the bill, which was
slated for Senate floor debate Tuesday.

<HEAD>Aerospace Company Says Restructuring Unrelated To Investor's Buy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. said Tuesday a
reorganization that includes the creation of an employee stock plan
was unrelated to investor Harold Simmons' purchase of 5.3 percent
of the aerospace company's stock.
   The restructuring plan also includes the sale of Lockheed's
computer operations and acceleration of a previously announced
program to move aircraft manufacturing operations from Burbank and
sell about 225 acres of land there. That land includes the ``Skunk
Works,'' where the F-117 stealth fighter is made.
   The plan was approved at a board of directors meeting that was
scheduled before Simmons revealed Monday he had accumulated 5.3
percent of Lockheed's 59.5 million shares, said company spokesman
Robert Slayman.
   Lockheed makes the Trident II missile, the C-5B military
transport plane and works on NASA's space station project and the
``Star Wars'' missile defense, in addition to other military and
aerospace projects.
   ``There is no denying there are defensive characteristics to
these things, but that is not the primary purpose,'' Slayman said
of the employee-stock plan, or ESOP, and the other moves. ``The
primary purpose is to enhance our competitiveness. This gives
(employees) a bigger stake in the success of our company.''
   Simmons _ who also said he planned substantial investments in
Chrysler Corp., Paccar Inc. and Phelps Dodge Corp. _ said in a
letter to Lockheed management last Friday that he didn't intend to
try to buy the company.
   ``We have no plans, or desire, to disrupt management. We expect
to be a constructive, long-term shareholder,'' the Dallas investor
said in the letter, which he released to the press Monday.
   The ESOP would buy 10.5 million newly issued shares of Lockheed
stock for $500 million, and the company would offset the dilution
of its stock by buying an equal number of shares held by the
public. Establishment of the ESOP would result in employee
ownership of 17 percent of Lockheed common stock, the company said.
   Such plans are sometimes used to defend against hostile
takeovers because it places stock in friendly hands. For instance,
an ESOP was instrumental in Polaroid Corp.'s successful defense
against a buyout by California investor Roy E. Disney.
   Lockheed adopted a ``poison pill'' takeover defense in December
after Simmons disclosed he intended to buy up to $15 million worth
of the company's stock. That plan would entitle current
stockholders to buy additional, newly issued stock at a discount in
the event of a hostile takeover attempt, thus making a buyout more
expensive.
   On Monday, Simmons told the Wall Street Journal he intended to
invest at least $15 million each in shares of Chrysler, Phelps
Dodge and Paccar, a Bellevue, Wash., truck maker.
   Lockheed's restructuring plan includes:
   _The speedup of the previously announced move of Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems Co. from factories next to Burbank Airport to
Palmdale and Rye Canyon, Calif., and Marietta, Ga. The moves, part
of a consolidation effort, are to be finished in 1991 instead of
1992 or 1993, as executives previously stated.
   The move will free 225 acres in Burbank for sale, the company
said, revealing for the first time the acreage.
   _The four companies or divisions that make up Lockheed's
information systems group will be sold. The group, with 3,900
employees, accounted for $589 million of the company's $10.6
billion in 1988 sales. To be sold are CalComp of Anaheim, CADAM
Inc. of Burbank, Metier Inc. of Houston and DataPlan of Los Gatos.

   Tribune Co. directors decided Tuesday to buy up
to 8 million shares of the company's stock, but the media
conglomerate would not say the move was designed to thwart a
potential takeover.
   The stock repurchase plan was authorized by the board of
directors one day after reports of the Robert M. Bass Group of Fort
Worth, Texas, acquiring 2 percent to 3 percent of Tribune Co. stock.
   Spokesmen for the Bass Group and Tribune Co. declined comment.
Tribune Co. would not say whether the plan was designed to stop a
possible takeover by Bass.
   Tribune Co. said it would issue $350 million worth of a new
series of convertible preferred stock to its employee stock
ownership plan. Money from the sale will be used to buy up to 8
million common shares on the open market.
   The company said it will make a loan to the employee stock plan
to finance the purchase of the convertible stock.
   ``Expansion of the (employee stock plan) increases ownership by
our employees and recognizes their significant economic stake in
Tribune Co.'s continued success,'' said Stanton R. Cook, chairman
and chief executive officer.
   More than two years ago the company said it would repurchase 10
million shares. It has acquired 8.6 million of them, it said.
   Tribune Co. holdings include the Chicago Tribune and the Daily
News of New York, as well as the Chicago Cubs baseball club, six TV
stations and a forest products unit.
