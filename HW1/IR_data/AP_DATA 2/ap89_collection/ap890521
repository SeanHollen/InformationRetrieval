<HEAD>Union Awaits Negotiators For School District</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the 22,000-member teachers'
union met again Sunday with school district representatives to seek
a solution to a week-old teacher walkout that has caused chaos in
city classrooms.
   Representatives of the Los Angeles Unified School District
arrived around 8:15 p.m., more than two hours after United
Teacher-Los Angeles negotiators showed up for talks set to begin at
6 p.m., said UTLA spokesman Catherine Carey.
   ``It looks like the other side is dragging its feet and trying
to prolong this thing,'' Ms. Carey said before they arrived. She
added that teachers were prepared for a second week in the walkout
that began May 15.
   ``We'll have our teachers out on the line again,'' she said.
``They've invested too much at this point.''
   Details of developments in recent talks have been sketchy
because of a news blackout imposed by state mediator Draz Mrvichin.
   The walkout last week played havoc with education in the nearly
600,000- student district. Many students walked out of classes and
some joined teachers on picket lines. In some cases, students were
housed in auditoriums because the district was unable to hire
enough substitute teachers to fill classrooms.
   During the 16-month-long labor dispute, teachers have sought
higher salaries and more say in how the district's 600-plus schools
are run.
   Teachers earn between $23,440 and $43,319 a year, depending on
experience and level of education. The union wants a three-year
contract with a 26 percent raise, including a 10 percent raise the
first year.
   The district, the second largest in the nation, has refused to
go higher than a 21.5 percent raise over three years.
   The strike, which began May 15, is the district's first since a
23-day walkout in 1970.

   A homebuilt airplane crashed after
performing in an air show Sunday, killing its owner-pilot and a
passenger, authorities said.
   Charles E. White, 49, of Berrien Springs and James O. Billings
Jr., 45, of St. Joseph were pronounced dead at the scene of the
crash, said state police dispatcher Suzi Hibberd.
   The single-engine, two-seat plane built by White crashed at 3:06
p.m. in Howard Township, Hibberd said. Witnesses said the plane
made a sudden left turn and plummeted about 300 feet into a field.
   White and Billings had participated earlier Sunday in an air
show in Benton Harbor.
   The Federal Aviation Administration was investigating the cause
of the crash, Hibberd said.

   Family members and a handful of friends attended
funeral services Sunday for the man authorities say was the
``godfather'' of a cult linked to at least 15 slayings on the
U.S.-Mexican border, a relative said.
   The body of Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, arrived in Miami late
Saturday night and was cremated for the funeral Sunday, Constanzo's
brother Fausto told WQBA radio in Miami.
   ``It was always his wish to be cremated,'' said Fausto
Constanzo, who said only that relatives and close friends were
invited to the funeral. He revealed no other details about the
services.
   ``It was a decision of ours to be so private,'' he said. ``We
don't want anyone there that doesn't belong there to curse the
funeral.''
   Constanzo has been described as the leader of a sect that
authorities blame for at least 15 killings outside the border city
of Matamoros. Sect members have said some slayings were ritual
killings while others were drug-related.
   Authorities had sought Constanzo and his female companion Sara
Aldrete Villarreal, 24, since the discovery of the first of the
bodies on a border ranch in April.
   Some bodies had been mutilated, with brains and organs removed.
   Aldrete and other sect members have said publicly that Constanzo
ordered his own execution and the killing of his right-hand man,
Martin Quintana Rodriguez, on May 6 when police moved in on their
Mexico City apartment earlier this month.
   An autopsy showed Constanzo died from multiple gunshot wounds to
the head and upper body.

   Soldiers on Sunday set up roadblocks to Beijing's
center and moved into its train station, but hundreds of thousands
of students defied martial law and remained in Tiananmen Square
despite fears of an army crackdown.
   Large pro-democracy demonstrations also were reported in several
other cities. In Shanghai, more than 300,000 people rallied on the
waterfront of the Huangpu River and 200,000 more gathered in the
city's People's Square.
   The only violence reported was a clash between armed police and
students in western Beijing on Saturday in which students said they
were attacked with electric cattle prods. One student injured in
the attack said 45 students were hospitalized.
   The thousands of students staging a week-old hunger strike in
the 100-acre Tiananmen Square ended their fast Saturday, saying
they needed to regain their strength in case troops moved in.
   Students and their supporters in the square early Sunday
numbered about 200,000. Protests since the hunger strike began have
drawn hundreds of thousands.
   The hunger strikers initially demanded a dialogue with the
government on reform, to be broadcast live, and an apology for an
initial official declaration that the student democracy movement
was a plot against the party.
   But after Premier Li Peng declared martial law in parts of the
capital Saturday to put an end to the protests, most students and
their supporters demanded Li resign.
   The army's move Sunday apparently was aimed at stopping the flow
of tens of thousands of people to the capital to join the protests.
Citizens blockaded the station by parking coal trucks across the
road and hundreds of students sat in front of it as a further
barrier.
   The army set up roadblocks around the capital about 12 miles
from the city center, said a Chinese source who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The source said 60,000 to 70,000 troops moved into the city
center by subway Sunday and followed connecting tunnels to the
walled palace, the history museum and the Great Hall of the People
on three sides of Tiananmen Square. The subway was closed to
regular traffic as of noon Saturday.
   There was no outward sign of the reported troop presence in the
city center and it could not be confirmed.
   Inside Tiananmen Square, the sun rose Sunday on a triumphant but
weary and bedraggled crowd of at least 200,000 students, medical
workers and ordinary citizens. The students spent the night sitting
in rows with gauze wound around their mouths and noses for
protection against a possible tear gas attack.
   Around the square and on roads throughout the city, citizens
barricaded the way with buses, trucks and anything available.
Thousands also surrounded tanks and trucks filled with soldiers at
several points in the suburbs, immobilizing them.
   ``The people are strong,'' an elderly woman marveled as the long
night ended peacefully.
   But soon after, five army helicopters swooped twice over the
square as they did repeatedly Saturday, reminding the protesters
the standoff was not over. The students waved and cheered defiantly.
   ``The danger is not over,'' said a medical student who was
helping care for about 3,000 of the students who were weakened by
the hunger strike.
   Student leaders had said over a loudspeaker Saturday night that
the protesters should not resist if the army came.
   ``Our principle is peaceful non-resistance,'' they said.
   On Sunday, the student leaders held lengthy, private meetings to
discuss their next step. Nothing was immediately announced. Some
reportedly favored staying in the square while others wanted to
join citizens confronting army vehicles.
   The widely ignored martial law regulations include bans on
marches, class boycotts, distribution of pamphlets, speeches, the
spreading of rumors, attacks on party, government or military
organs and ``any other destructive actions.''
   Li's hard-line stand toward the students appears to have forced
the resignation of the more liberal Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   Chinese sources said Zhao, highly respected for his pioneering
work in economic reforms, resigned his post after failing to
persuade Li and senior leader Deng Xiaoping to compromise with the
students. There has been no official word on Zhao's future.
   Li's political victory could be brief, however, if the military
refuses to cooperate in the crackdown.
   Britain on Saturday urged that the Chinese government and
demonstrators use ``restraint and moderation'' in the crisis. The
United States and France recommended that their citizens not travel
to the country.
   Protesters in Beijing have demanded Deng retire.
   Deng, 84, is widely admired for initiating market-oriented
reforms in China. But he has come under sharp attack by students
for holding onto power too long and letting political reform lag
behind his economic reforms.
   The students began the protests on April 15 after the death of
former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a leading reformer who was
ousted from his post for not cracking down on earlier student
protests.
   The rallies gradually grew in size as workers and others joined
in and evolved into the biggest show of defiance in China's 40
years of communist rule.

   Britain ordered the expulsion of 11 Soviets, and
the Soviet Union responded by ordering eight British diplomats and
three journalists out of the country for alleged espionage, the
British Embassy said Sunday.
   ``It's a mirror-image act of retaliation,'' British Ambassador
Rodric Q. Braithwaite told a news conference.
   Roderic Lyne, the embassy's political counselor, said
Braithwaite was summoned to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on Saturday
night and told that 11 Britons would have to leave Moscow within 14
days.
   The previous day, Soviet Ambassador Leonid Zamyatin was called
to the British Foreign Office in London and told by Sir John
Fretwell, the deputy permanent undersecretary, that 11 Soviets were
engaged in ``activities incompatible with their status'' and must
leave in 14 days, a British Foreign Office spokesman said in London.
   The spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said Britain had not planned to make public the expulsions
and did so only after the Soviets retalitated.
   The spokesman refused to say what the Soviets were accused of
doing, but the charge he used of ``incompatible activities'' is
diplomatic jargon for espionage.
   Lyne said the Britons ordered expelled from Moscow were Embassy
Second Secretary Michael Anderson, Second Secretary Adam Noble,
Third Secretary Paul Sharp, Vice Consul Helen Pickering, Naval
Attache Capt. Christopher Meyer, Assistant Naval Attache Lt. Cmdr.
Christopher Watson, Assistant Military Attache Maj. Nigel
Shakespear and Warrant Officer Laing Purfit of the Defense Ministry
staff.
   Jeremy Harris of the British Broadcasting Corp., Ian
Glover-James of Independent Television News and Angus Roxburgh of
the Sunday Times of London also were give two weeks to leave the
Soviet Union, Lyne said.
   Roxburgh called the action ``ludicrous, almost too silly to
comment on.''
   The Foreign Office in London refused to identify the Soviets
expelled. Britain's ITN radio reported the Soviets were caught
spying on military installations.
   Press Association, the domestic British news agency, quoted
unidentified diplomats as saying those expelled from Britain
include Soviet journalists.
   The expulsions of British and Soviet nationals are the first
since the two countries expelled 31 of each other's citizens four
years ago.
   The 1985 dispute began when London ordered 25 Soviets to leave
after they were identified as secret agents by Soviet defector Oleg
Gordievsky.
   In addition to the 11 Britons ordered expelled Saturday, Lyne
said three British diplomats who had already completed their tours
of assignment in Moscow last year were declared ``persona non
grata'' by the Soviets, meaning they cannot return.
   Zamyatin also was told Friday that three former staff members at
the Soviet Embassy in London could not come back to Britain, Lyne
said.

   Students occupying Tiananmen Square in violation
of martial law said Sunday Premier Li Peng ordered them to leave
the square by dawn Monday or face a military attack. Troops
occupied major state-run news organizations.
   Soldiers set up roadblocks around Beijing, presumably to prevent
more demonstrators from reaching the capital, and about 1,500
troops armed with automatic weapons moved into the train station.
   Troops occupied the People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, the
Central Radio Station and the Central Television Station, a
People's Daily reporter said.
   Soldiers will be sent to major universities, which have been the
center of the monthlong protests for democratic change, to ``keep
order,'' Beijing television reported.
   Li called the 27th and 28th armies into the capital Friday night
and declared martial law in central Beijing on Saturday to put down
the student-led protests that have drawn hundreds of thousands of
people and caused major demonstrations in other cities. He did not
say how many troops were called in.
   Li, in a message to the independent student union that has led
the protests for a free press, an end to official corruption and
other reforms, said the military would clear Tiananmen by force by
5 a.m. Monday if the students refused to leave, according to an
announcement by the union.
   In a broadcast over the student loudspeaker system in the
square, they also claimed Li told Beijing jails to be ready to
accept a large number of students.
   ``We call on all of you to come stand with us,'' a student said
after the announcement. ``The students are very weak and they need
the people of Beijing to help them. Even 200,000 people cannot
withstand the army.''
   A Chinese source said 60,000 to 70,000 troops moved into the
city center by subway and followed connecting tunnels to the walled
palace, the history museum and the Great Hall of the People on
three sides of Tiananmen. The subway was closed to regular traffic
as of noon Saturday and remained closed Sunday.
   There was no outward sign of the reported troop presence and it
could not be confirmed.
   Official media repeatedly broadcast a statement that troops were
in Beijing to restore order, not to suppress the students. But it
was clear order could not be restored without moving the students
from Tiananmen.
   The widely ignored martial law regulations include bans on
marches, class boycotts, distribution of pamphlets, speeches, the
spreading of rumors, attacks on party, government or military
organs and ``any other destructive actions.''
   Li's hard-line stand toward the students appears to have forced
the resignation of the more liberal Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   Demonstrations in other cities continued Sunday.
   Tens of thousands of people marched in Shanghai, according to a
Western resident, and police diverted traffic. Several hundred
marched in the coastal city of Tianjin, a reporter at a local
newspaper said.
   The military failed to make an expected attack Saturday night on
200,000 students and supporters who kept all-night vigil in
Tiananmen Square. Many spent the night with gauze wound around
their mouths and noses for protection against a tear gas attack and
others slept on the hard stone pavement.
   Around the square and on roads citywide, citizens barricaded the
way to Tianamen with buses, trucks, lightposts and anything else
available.
   Thousands surrounded and immobilized tanks and trucks filled
with soldiers throughout the city and in the suburbs. Local
residents gave the soldiers cigarettes, food and water, and at one
point Sunday 600 soldiers retreated several hundred yards.
   Troops set up blockades on highways into Beijing to prevent more
people from moving into the capital.
   Crowds in Tiananmen and the surrounding area thinned
substantially Sunday, but people began flocking toward the square
in the evening after Li's ultimatum was announced.

   Fourteen drug traffickers convicted by

the number of such executions since January to 637, Tehran radio
reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said the hangings took
place in northwestern Lahijan and central Birjand.
   In January, Iranian authorities launched a nationwide crackdown
on drug abuse. Under a new law, anyone caught in possession of even
small amounts of any drug receives the death penalty.
   In the last nine days alone, 79 drug traffickers were hanged.
   The government has said that about 1 million of Iran's 50
million people are drug abusers, but unofficial estimates put the
figure at twice that.

   President Lee Teng-hui on Sunday accepted
the resignation of Premier Yu Kuo-hwa after failing to persuade him
to remain in office, the official Central News Agency reported.
   Yu, 75, announced Wednesday he had submitted his resignation to
Lee to make way for a younger person and also to preserve unity
within the governing Nationalist Party.
   Yu, Taiwan's premier since 1984, has been criticized for his
cautious approach to economic and political reforms. Younger
members of the party consider him a liability in a December
parliamentary election.
   The CNA report made no mention of Yu's successor.
   But newspapers said earlier the probable candidate is Lee Huan,
72, the Nationalist Party's popular secretary-general. A decision
will be made at a meeting Wednesday of the policy-making central
committee, newspapers said.

<HEAD>Syrian Gunboats Intercept Lebanese Cargo Ship</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five Syrian gunboats intercepted a
freighter carrying supplies for Lebanon's besieged Christians and
forced it to return to Cyprus, an army spokesman said Sunday.
   The Syrians' use of their naval forces, along with intensified
weekend shelling, marked a tightening of the blockade on the
Christians' coastal enclave.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
identified the Lebanese-owned vessel as the Cedars and said it was
intercepted at dawn Saturday as it was heading to a harbor near the
northern city of Tripoli.
   Christian sources say Syria has based a flotilla of gunboats in
Tripoli, which is Syrian-controlled, despite Israel's traditional
control of Lebanon's Mediterranean coastline.
   It was the first known Syrian interception of a ship heading for
the Christian enclave. Despite daily shelling of the Christian
ports, several small freighters have made it through.
   Police said Syrian artillery in and around Moslem west Beirut
pounded the enclave's coastline with 200 shells and rockets
Saturday and Sunday in another violation of an Arab League
cease-fire declared May 11.
   The bombardment, the heaviest since the cease-fire was called,
targeted a 10-mile-long stretch of beach between the ports of
Jounieh and Byblos, police reported.
   The Syrians and their Druse Moslem militia allies have been
shelling the Christian ports to prevent ships with food or weapons
from reaching the enclave. No casualties were reported in the
latest attacks.
   At least 359 people have been killed and 1,393 wounded since
fighting began March 8 between army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's
mainly Christian troops and the alliance of Syrian and Druse forces.
   Aoun, who heads a Christian Cabinet vying for power with a rival
Moslem government, accused Syria of sending reconnaissance jets on
``provocative runs'' over the enclave for the first time during the
confrontation.
   He charged that Israel's failure to challenge the Syrian
penetration of what the Israelis consider their air force's
preserve was ``evidence of a backstage understanding between Syria
and Israel on maintaining their occupation of Lebanon.''
   The Syrians have 40,000 troops with tanks deployed in Lebanon,
mostly in Moslem territory, under an increasingly discredited 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Israel occupies a border strip in
south Lebanon.
   Aoun contends the Syrians have lost their credibility as
peacekeepers by siding with the Moslem side. He has declared a
``war of liberation'' to drive out the Syrians, whose forces
outnumber his troops 4-to-1.
   The last known Syrian air force flights over Lebanon were in the
early days of Israel's 1982 invasion. Israel claimed it shot down
80 Syrian jets over the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in east
Lebanon then.
   Aoun also charged that Syria and its allies were bent on
``detonating a new security blowup in Lebanon'' before an Arab
summit Tuesday to discuss ways of ending Lebanon's 14-year-old
civil war.
   He said Arab heads of state must not allow Syria to ``swallow''
Lebanon, and he urged Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
intervene to stop the bombardment of the Christian enclave. Moscow
is Syria's main arms supplier.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the pro-Syrian
Cabinet, messaged Arab leaders gathering for the summit that a
Syrian pullout from Lebanon can only be demanded by a unified
Lebanese government.

   They huddled together, marched, debated and
waited restlessly for an attack by their own army. When the sun
rose Sunday, it showed a city physically and emotionally taxed by
the first nervous night of martial law.
   Tiananmen Square, the majestic 100-acre expanse at the heart of
Beijing, was a garbage-strewn squatter camp for 200,000 students
and supporters who spent the night in fear.
   Broad, tree-lined Changan Avenue, the main east-west street, was
littered with garbage and broken glass. Empty buses were parked
across main intersections. Colorful flags that had been hung over
the street to welcome Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev last week
were ripped or torn down.
   All over the city, residents who spent the night guarding their
streets against an expected troop advance began going home to rest.
   ``They'll come back at night,'' said a student who was among the
students, medical workers and supporters occupying Tiananmen Square.
   Some curled up on the ground and tried to sleep, but most spent
the night in anxious activity _ marching around the square,
listening to student speeches and preparing for an attack.
   ``Obey the orders of the broadcast station,'' student leaders
urged repeatedly over the loudspeaker system rigged in the square.
``Do not take any action without hearing it on the broadcast.''
   Another broadcast warned to be careful when stepping on subway
grates _ ``they might be electrified.'' Several thousand students
from the Inner Mongolian University sat outside a nearby subway
stop in case soldiers emerged from it.
   Students walked around with rolls of gauze hanging around their
necks or around their heads, ready to be pulled over their noses
and mouths in case of tear gas assaults.
   Despite the knowledge that troops had entered the city and were
carrying tear gas, many people said they could not believe soldiers
of the People's Liberation Army would attack their own countrymen.
   ``I don't think anything bad will happen,'' said a student from
the Beijing Medical University No. 3 Hospital, who was in the
square with hundreds of other medical workers to treat students who
had been on a hunger strike.
   ``No one wants violence, the soldiers especially,'' he said.
   Student leaders announced that ``latest information'' said the
troops would arrive at 2 a.m. Sunday. When the hour arrived, the
students sat in rows facing outward and pulled their gauze into
place.
   ``We can't fear for ourselves, we are fighting for the future of
democracy,'' one student said through the mask.
   Off to one side, a woman with a megaphone tried to organize
local residents to gather around the students. A man ran up crying,
``The soldiers are already in Northern Pond Road.'' Someone else
reported tanks in his home district, about six miles from Tiananmen.
   More than 300 motocyclists, many riding double, roared around
the square every hour, honking their horns and leaving a cloud of
exhaust fumes.
   Rumors flew. When no troops appeared at 2 a.m., the woman
announced they were now expected at 4 a.m. The students, sensing
they would not come, played Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy'' over the
loudspeaker system at 3 a.m. to express their relief.
   The sky lightened, and residents on nearby streets who had sat
outside all night picked up their stools and went in. People who
spent the night at intersections barricaded with lane dividers,
street signs and anything else available began rubbing sleepy eyes
and hopping on their bicycles to go home.
   ``We've won again,'' said one.
   In the square, students broke formation and began shoveling
garbage into piles and nibbling on steamed bread. The loudspeaker
played the official radio station's 6:30 a.m. newscast, which
repeated the martial law order that took effect Saturday.
   When the newscast reported that Italy's government had resigned,
some students cheered _ that is what they want their own government
to do.
   Most regarded the rising sun as a temporary form of protection,
but one Beijing University student warned that soldiers could come
by day, too.
   ``We can't relax, there's still danger,'' he said. As if to
illustrate, five military helicopters swept into view and circled
the square twice.
   The students stood, waved their arms and cheered.
   ``We're welcoming them,'' one said sarcastically.

<TEXT>
   President Richard von Weizsaecker's
patrician lineage and eloquent oratory satisfy a longing of his
countrymen for a royal statesman who can skillfully temper their
past sins with postwar achievements.
   His rise from the shadow of his father's role in the Nazi
leadership to what is now the most respected federal office mirrors
the stunning West German recovery from wartime ruin and testifies
to the resilience of a modern family dynasty.
   Weizsaecker will be re-elected without opposition Tuesday to a
second term as head of state by the Federal Convention, which meets
every five years to elect a president.
   Each of the five political parties represented in the federal
Parliament is entitled to nominate a candidate, but for the first
time in the nation's 40-year history, the vote will be uncontested.
   Weizsaecker, a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
Christian Democratic Union, has won endorsement of all but the
far-left Greens Party, which nonetheless decided against running a
challenger.
   The unusual unity displayed by West Germany's diverse and
fractious political parties reflects the respect the 69-year-old
Weizsaecker has won during his first term as president.
   In the latest nationwide poll, conducted by the Institute for
Opinion Research in Allensbach, Weizsaecker drew an approval rating
of more than 85 percent.
   A man who by nature keeps above the political fray, Weizsaecker
has transformed the mostly ceremonial office of president into an
influential post of elder statesman and curator of a national
conscience.
   His articulate address on the 40th anniversary of the end of
World War II won praise worldwide as an effort to bring fellow
Germans to terms with the Holocaust they perpetrated.
   ``Guilt is, like innocence, not collective, but personal,'' the
president said. ``All of us, whether guilty or not, whether young
or old, must accept the past. We are all affected by its
consequences and liable for it.''
   But striking a chord of balance with West Germans weary of the
shame bequeathed by their forebears, Weizsaecker also has called
for a fair assessment of the accomplishments of his state built on
the smoldering ruins of the Third Reich.
   Chapters of his own past have been a burden borne unflinchingly.
   Born in Stuttgart on April 15, 1920, to a titled family of
intellectuals, Weizsaecker began his studies in 1937 at Oxford,
where he perfected the English he speaks fluently today, then
joined Adolf Hitler's army in 1938.
   He marched into Poland with his infantry regiment on the first
day of World War II, lost a brother in the invasion and continued
to serve until the German capitulation May 8, 1945.
   After resuming his law studies, he served as deputy defense
council for his father, Ernst von Weizsaecker, who was sentenced at
the 1947 Nuremberg trials to eight years in prison for his role as
a deputy foreign minister in the Nazi leadership.
   While Weizsaecker is generally revered by West Germans, critics
can be found at both political extremes.
   Ultra-rightist leader Franz Schoenhuber, whose service in the
Waffen SS continues to haunt his political career, complained
recently that he is called to account repeatedly for the Nazi
period while Weizsaecker ``has remained virtually untouched.''
   Greens spokesman Michael Schroerer said his party, which polls
less than 10 percent, declined to support Weizsaecker ``more for
what he hasn't done than for any misdeed,'' contending the
president could more actively address residual problems of
discrimination and injustice.
   Some prominent Greens like Otto Schily, however, have said they
plan to vote for Weizsaecker.
   Ingeborg Menz of the federal Parliament office explained that
the Federal Convention at which the president will be elected for a
second and final term is made up of the 519 federal Parliament
members and an equal number of delegates from the 11 state
legislatures.
   An avid sportsman frequently pictured skiing or
mountain-climbing, Weiszaecker is chosen most often as a model for
young Germans, said spokesman Edgar Piel of the Institute for
Opinion Research.
   Piel said West Germans respect Weizsaecker because of his image
as a moral and noble statesman, allowing them to maintain an ersatz
monarchy.
   The ``von'' in the family name stems from the title of baron
bestowed on his grandfather in 1916 by the royal family of
Wuerttemberg.
   After managerial stints in steel, banking and pharmaceuticals,
Weizsaecker was head of the German Protestant Church from 1964 to
1970. He served in the federal Parliament from 1969 through his
election as mayor of West Berlin, a high-profile post that
propelled him into the presidency in 1984.
   Weizsaecker has traveled frequently since his election,
including making the first West German presidential visit to Israel
in 1985, helping to mold the nation's affluent and sophisticated
postwar image.

<TEXT>
   For much of her life, Helen Suzman has fought
apartheid in South Africa, sometimes the single lonely voice
calling for reform. Last week she announced she will retire from
Parliament after 36 years. Here is a look at her work.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in 1963, a legislator of
the governing National Party said of Helen Suzman, who
single-handedly represented the anti-apartheid opposition: ``Her
days in Parliament are numbered.''
   That would-be prophet, Cas Greyling, has since left Parliament,
as has every one of his contemporaries except the indomitable woman
he derided. Her days in office number some 13,200.
   Last week Mrs. Suzman, 71, announced she will not seek
re-election in September, ending a 36-year parliamentary career.
Few politicians anywhere have served so long, in opposition to such
an entrenched governing party, and fought so determinedly for their
convictions.
   For 13 of those years, from 1961 to 1974, she was the only
member of Parliament speaking out against apartheid and campaigning
for black rights. During a 15-week session in 1961, she made 66
speeches, offered 26 amendments and submitted 137 questions to
parliamentary leaders.
   ``I don't know how I made so many speeches,'' she said. ``I
wrote every one myself _ that's why they were so lousy. They were
not flowing speeches, but the contents have pleased me. When I look
back at these speeches, I still think I have taken the right line.''
   She has been lauded as ``the conscience of white South Africa.''
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain was among those
saluting her last week. Yet despite the accolades, Mrs. Suzman
departed only slightly from her customary modesty.
   ``Without actually saying, `I told you so,' it has been a source
of considerable satisfaction to have been in Parliament over the
past 10 years, when many of the laws I opposed when they were
introduced have been repealed,'' she told her colleagues Thursday.
   She referred to the repeal of laws prohibiting interracial
marriages, reserving certain jobs for whites and requiring blacks
to have permits to be in whites-only areas.
   The Sowetan, the country's largest black-oriented daily
newspaper, said many blacks ``owe her gratitude for the battles she
has fought.''
   ``The great pity is that South Africa simply was not good enough
to have a person such as herself as the head of state,'' The
Sowetan said.
   Mrs. Suzman says her worst moment in Parliament came in 1966
when Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd was fatally stabbed by a
deranged assassin, a few yards away from her. P.W. Botha, defense
minister at the time and now president, told her as he rushed past:
``You liberals did this. Now we will get you.''
   Mrs. Suzman did not speak to Botha for several years, and their
relationship remains distant. They served together in Parliament
from 1953 until Botha became president in 1985. In one exchange in
1981, Botha warned her not to break the law, and she replied: ``I
am not frightened of you. I never have been and never will be. I
think nothing of you.''
   Botha also will retire in September.
   One of Mrs. Suzman's roles has been that of prophet. In 1981,
referring to the unrest, she said: ``If it gets really bad, the
government might suspend the law and rule by edict.'' In 1986,
Botha imposed a national state of emergency that remains in force.
   Mrs. Suzman predicted last week that blacks eventually will gain
political rights and that remaining segregation laws will ``waste
away'' or be repealed, ``though, alas, I will not be here to
welcome their disappearance.''
   Mrs. Suzman was born Helen Gavronksy, daughter of Jewish
immigrants from Lithuania. She enrolled at Johannesburg's
University of the Witwatersrand at 16, married physician Moses
Suzman at 19, and later taught at Witwatersrand before running for
Parliament in 1952 from Houghton, a wealthy Johannesburg district
she has served ever since.
   Militants in later years urged her to quit, saying a Parliament
that excluded blacks was no place for a genuine foe of apartheid.
   But she is convinced she played a vital role by ``keeping
certain values alive.''
   Her approach to politics was simple, she said last week: ``If
you stick to basic principles, you don't ever have to regret what
you said.''
   Other assessments of her career were less restrained.
   ``Only an extraordinary commitment to her political ideas could
have carried her through the long years when she, alone, upheld the
banner of civilization in Parliament,'' said Business Day, a
Johannesburg newspaper. ``She held a torch aloft in time of
darkness.''

   China's students repeatedly have called for
reforms over the past decade, but current pro-democracy
demonstrations in Beijing and other cities are by far the largest
and boldest communist China has faced.
   Student dissent has been gathering strength since senior leader
Deng Xiaoping took power and initiated his policies of reform in
the late 1970s.
   The first open challenge to the government came in the Democracy
Wall movement of 1978-79. The movement was so named because
protesters wrote posters demanding freedom and complaining about a
wide range of social ills and tacked them to a wall in western
Beijing.
   Deng, seeking to wrest power held by leftists left over from the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution, allowed the movement as long as it
focused on the wrongs of the past. When criticisms began to hit
closer to home, he cracked down.
   Dozens of dissidents were arrested, including Wei Jingsheng, who
was sentenced to 15 years in prison for counterrevolutionary
activities. Wei remains behind bars.
   The harsh measures effectively muffled democratic dissent for
about five years. During the 1980s, students occasionally launched
protests on their abysmal living conditions, the presence of
factories and army troops on campuses, and crime, but they stayed
away from political issues.
   In December 1984, for example, 5,000 Beijing University students
marched on the university president's home to complain about
unheated dormitories and an 11 p.m. lights-out policy.
   Dissent took a political turn in September 1985 when 1,000
students congregated at Tiananmen Square to condemn what they said
was Japan's ``economic invasion'' of China.
   The authorities, disturbed when students shifted from
criticizing Japan to talking about rising food prices and
government corruption, launched a propaganda campaign that stifled
the unrest.
   But a little more than a year later, in December 1986, the
students rose up again. In demonstrations and protests that spread
to dozens of cities, students demanded greater campus autonomy,
less bureaucratic control over their lives and a more democratic
society.
   Tens of thousands flooded the streets of Shanghai. Beijing
students staged all-night marches to Tiananmen Square.
   The demonstrations ran their course in a month, and the
government responded with a chilling campaign against ``bourgeois
liberalization,'' or the attraction to Western liberal thinking.
   Three leading intellectuals, including astrophysicist Fang
Lizhi, were purged from the Communist Party for allegedly fomenting
the unrest, and Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang,
regarded as sympathetic to the students, was ousted by party
conservatives.
   The pro-democracy movement again went underground.
   It surfaced in June 1988 when 1,000 Beijing University students
marched to Tiananmen Square to protest the slaying of a fellow
student by a gang of ruffians. Activists took advantage of the
student anger to put up posters denouncing official corruption and
demanding democratic reforms.
   The current explosion of protest was triggered by the death
April 15 of former party chief Hu. Students took to the streets to
mourn the man they feel was wronged by the party, but more
importantly, to express again all they felt was wrong with China's
political system.
   Mass protests have not been confined to students in the past
decade.
   Farmers have protested pollution and official profiteering;
unemployed youth have marched for jobs; and people sent to the
countryside during the Cultural Revolution have demanded to be
allowed to return to their city homes.
   Tibetans seeking independence from China have protested
violently three times since October 1987, and the minority Uyghurs
of far western China have demonstrated against nuclear testing in
their region.
   This month, 2,500 Chinese Moslems, emboldened by the
pro-democracy demonstrators, marched through the streets of Beijing
to demand the banning of a Chinese book they said blasphemed their
religion. It was banned.

<HEAD>Consumers Urged to Use Electricity More Efficiently, Not Less</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Virginia, you can earn a $4 monthly credit
on your electric bill by letting the utility cut power to your
water heater for a few hours a few times a month.
   In southern New Jersey, you can get a one-time cash rebate from
the utility of up to $619 for replacing your air conditioner with a
more efficient one.
   An Arizona utility offers to knock $75 off your bill if you put
a reflective film on your home's windows to block out the
ultraviolet rays of the desert sun.
   Across the country _ with some stark exceptions _ electric
utilities are pouring money into programs aimed at encouraging
energy efficiency and shifting the use of electricity from the peak
periods of demand to other times.
   ``There's a big move starting up,'' says Stephen Wiel, chairman
of the energy conservation committee of the National Association of
Regulatory Utility Commissioners.
   The main reason: Demands on the power supply system are growing
so rapidly that utilities are nearing the point of having to invest
in new sources of supply. The colossal failure of many past
investments in nuclear power plants is a powerful disincentive to
risk the billions needed for new construction.
   Virginia Power figures its program of interrupting power to
145,000 residential water heaters has saved it the need to add 150
megawatts of generating capacity _ the equivalent of a small power
plant, says spokesman Carl Baab.
   Utilities in some parts of the country have been tinkering with
electricity demand _ mainly to even out the daily and seasonal
peaks and valleys _ for several years. But the trend is now
accelerating as the utilities realize ``load management'' _ as it's
called in the business _ can mean more profits.
   Here's how: By encouraging customers to use less power in the
peak periods of summer and winter and to use more the rest of the
time, a utility can boost its overall electricity sales without
having to add to its maximum generating capacity.
   ``The reason we're doing this is that it's just good business,''
says Thomas Morron, a vice president of Edison Electric Institute,
an industry association.
   For consumers, these programs can mean lower electric bills. The
savings come not only from using more efficient appliances and
heating and cooling systems but also from avoiding the rate
increases that plant construction can bring.
   William McCollam Jr., president of Edison Electric, recently
estimated the number of utility-sponsored energy efficiency
programs had grown from 134 in 1977 to nearly 1,300 last year.
   He said this has allowed the industry to avoid adding 21,000
megawatts of new capacity over the past decade _ the equivalent of
about 21 large generating plants. A single plant that size would be
expected to cost at least $1 billion.
   After a decade of slow growth, electricity sales in the past two
years jumped by about 5 percent a year. Experts differ on the
outlook for future growth, but most agree demand could outstrip
supply in the 1990s unless new generating capacity is added.
   This is a key reason for the emphasis now on efficiency gains
and programs that can postpone the day when a utility must decide
how to supplement its power supply.
   The trend is not uniform, however. Some utilities have a surplus
of power and are aggressively peddling it.
   Ohio Edison Co. is offering financial incentives for natural gas
customers to convert their water heaters to electric and to buy
heaters that will run electric as well as on oil or gas.
   ``We're loaded with power; the idea is to sell it,'' said D.W.
Bettiker, coordinator of residential sales for Ohio Edison. ``We've
never had a conservation program.''
   Some of the utility programs are billed as conservation efforts,
but increasingly the term ``efficiency'' is substituted to reflect
the goal of stretching the use of each kilowatt-hour of power,
rather than eliminating some uses.
   ``One of the tough nuts to crack is the customer's perception
that conservation means deprivation,'' said Morron. ``Conservation
doesn't mean you have to put on a hair shirt and go live in a
cave.''
   Rather than being urged to turn down the thermostat in winter,
consumers are being told they can save money and still stay warm by
getting a more efficient heater.
   One of the most innovative utility programs is at Central Maine
Power. It hired an energy services company, Sesco Inc. of
Springfield, Mass., to make efficiency improvements in about 11,000
residences. Sesco pays for the improvements _ such as attic
insulation, window calking and lighting changes _ and the utility
pays Sesco for measurable reductions in each home's electricity use.
   The deal is set so the utility is assured of paying less for the
conservation than it would have paid to buy that amount of energy
from an outside supplier, or to build a new power plant to generate
the additional electricity. The utility customers pay nothing for
the efficiency improvements and are expected to save $2 million in
charges in the first year of the program.
   ``If all goes well, it's a win-win situation,'' said Frank
Chiaravalloti, a Central Maine spokesman.
   Although a growing number of utilities are starting or expanding
conservation and efficiency programs, some experts say regulatory
changes will be needed before the industry taps fully into the deep
reservoir of savings potential.
   The key problem from the utilities' viewpoint is that most state
regulatory agencies do not allow the industry to earn a profit on
their investment in conservation. They are allowed to recover the
cost, but no more. The result is that utilities may view increased
conservation as decreased profits.

   Booze, inexperience and complacency
conspired to cause the nation's worst oil spill, evidence and
testimony suggest after a five-day federal investigative hearing
that found plenty of blame to spread around.
   The National Transportation Safety Board hearing on the Exxon
Valdez oil spill concluded Saturday. Board member Lee Dickinson
said the agency's report probably will be issued in early 1990.
   The hearing came nearly two months after the tanker ran aground
on a charted reef and ripped its hull open, bleeding nearly 11
million gallons of crude oil into biologically rich Prince William
Sound. The oil has coated hundreds of miles of coast and killed
birds and marine mammals.
   ``There are any number of things that may have occurred, some
mistakes that were made, and all those together may have been what
led to the grounding of the Exxon Valdez,'' Dickinson said.
   The 987-foot tanker was heading south from Valdez the night of
March 23 with a load of Alaskan crude when Capt. Joseph Hazelwood
directed it across a northbound shipping lane to avoid chunks of
ice from a glacier.
   The captain received Coast Guard permission for the diversion.
But without approval the ship continued beyond the traffic lanes.
Hazelwood handed over control to Third Mate Gregory Cousins and
left the bridge several minutes before the tanker ran aground at
12:04 a.m. March 24.
   In nearly 45 hours of testimony, not one of the 28 witnesses
admitted doing anything wrong. But their testimony and more than
1,000 pages of evidence implicate the following players:
   _Hazelwood, who has been charged with operating the ship while
drunk and declined to testify because of his pending criminal
trial. Testimony indicated he may have had a blood-alcohol level of
0.22 percent at the time of the wreck, five times the legal limit.
Witnesses said they smelled alcohol on his breath before and after
the wreck.
   The captain also left Cousins in charge, knowing he was not
certified to pilot the ship through the sound. And Hazelwood had
the tanker on automatic pilot although company policy restricts use
of the device to open water.
   _Cousins, who took the ship off automatic pilot 12 minutes
before the crash but failed to turn the vessel away from Bligh
Reef. He testified that the ship didn't respond to his rudder
changes, but an on-board recorder indicated his turns were simply
too late.
   _Exxon Shipping Co., which was aware of Hazelwood's alcoholism
but said it was unaware he had resumed drinking after undergoing
hospital treatment in 1985. Although the company president said
Exxon has a strict anti-drinking policy, employees testified they
rarely saw evidence that the policy was enforced.
   Testimony also revealed that Exxon had reduced its tanker crews
in favor of increased automation.
   _Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., operator of the Alaskan oil
pipeline and the Valdez terminal, which failed to respond as
quickly to the disaster as it had estimated it would in its
spill-contingency plan. A barge used to carry equipment to the
spill was empty when the ship ran aground, and it took 10 hours to
load it.
   _The Coast Guard's radar ship-monitoring system. Traffic
controllers in Valdez testified the ship was not visible on radar
after it left Valdez Narrows. They blamed weather for decreasing
the radar's range that night.
   Witnesses were questioned by NTSB staffers and representatives
of the Coast Guard, state, Exxon and Alyeska. Participants were
aware their testimony may be admitted in court, where Exxon and
Alyeska face potentially huge liability costs.
   Government and industry officials tried to use the hearing to
their best legal and political advantage.
   Exxon's William Deppe and Alyeska's William Howitt worked to
elicit testimony that would show their companies did everything
possible to avoid and then respond to the disaster.
   Through their questions they suggested that the spill was beyond
containment, that government got in the way and that the spill
might have been avoided if the Coast Guard radar had been working
properly.
   State officials alleged the industry was unprepared for a large
spill, failed to follow its contingency plans and allowed
conditions that led to the spill to go unchecked.

   Eight Republicans and three Democrats are
fighting in party primaries to emerge from the shadow of Gov.
Thomas H. Kean, widely credited with pumping pride into a state
that was long a favored target of standup comics.
   But Kean, a Republican who is barred by law from seeking a third
consecutive term, remains a central figure in the campaign,
especially among GOP candidates who vying to inherit his mantle.
   A millionaire from an old and influential New Jersey family,
Kean won office in 1981 by the narrowest margin in New Jersey
history, defeating Democratic Rep. James Florio by less than
one-twelfth of 1 percent of the vote.
   By 1985, his popularity had soared and he won a second term by
the widest margin in state history, getting 62 percent of the black
vote and widespread support among labor and Democrats.
   While the national Republican party grew more conservative under
Reagan, Kean advanced a moderate doctrine and urged the GOP to
bring women, blacks and other minorities into its fold.
   He rose to national prominence, delivering the keynote address
at the Republican National Convention last year and winning praise
from Presidents Reagan and Bush for his education initiatives.
   And he has been an unabashed New Jersey booster, appearing on
television commercials that tout the Garden State as an exciting
place to visit _ a novel thought for most Americans.
   His popularity in a state where Democrats far outnumber
Republicans makes him a tough act to follow.
   ``It's just like George Bush trying to succeed Ronald Reagan.
You have enormously huge shoes to fill,'' said Roger Stone, a
Washington-based consultant who is running Republican Rep. James
Courter's campaign.
   Stone said Kean was the first New Jersey governor to use
television to build a public image that reached beyond the state's
borders.
   Television is playing a crucial role in the primary, and
candidates are spending millions to broadcast their messages in the
nation's most expensive television markets.
   Although only about 400,000 members of each party are expected
to cast primary ballots, candidates will pour more than $7 million
into television advertising during the three weeks before the June
6 primary.
   When Kean took office, New Jersey staggered under economic
stagnation, high unemployment rates and serious budget problems.
   For most of his term, Kean rode an economic boom. He doubled the
size of the state budget during years when the treasury overflowed
with $1 billion surpluses.
   But the good times came to an abrupt halt before the primary
season. A predicted shortfall for next year grew to $500 million.
Some budget analysts believe the gap could be as wide as $700
million.
   Soaring auto insurance rates have dominated the primary race,
followed by debates over how to lower high local property tax rates
and whether state taxes should be increased to solve the budget
crisis.
   Growing traffic problems, congestion and the problems of
managing rapid growth in the nation's most densely populated state
also are big issues.
   Several of the candidates have likened themselves to Kean.
   Courter, former Attorney General Cary Edwards and Sen. William
Gormley are close Kean allies. Courter and Edwards use Kean's name
in slogans that appear below their ballot lines, calling themselves
``Tom Kean Republicans.''
   Gormley and Edwards are the most moderate candidates in the
race. Courter, Assembly Speaker Chuck Hadwick and Sen. Gerald
Cardinale have carved images as conservative Republicans.
   Among the Democrats, Florio, author of the federal Superfund
law, is widely considered the virtually unbeatable frontrunner. Now
in his third bid for the statehouse, he has run a low profile
campaign, drawing criticism from his opponents for remaining silent
on many key issues.
   In spite of the stacked political odds, liberal Assemblyman Alan
Karcher and Princeton Mayor Barbara Boggs Sigmund, daughter of Rep.
Lindy Boggs, D-La., and the late Hale Boggs, are running spirited
Democratic campaigns.
   Three other Republicans are running low-budget campaigns. They
are former state tourism official Lois Rand, retired Coast Guard
Capt. Thomas Blomquist and James A. Kolyer, an industrial arts
teacher from Matawan.

   Rep. Tony Coelho owned an interest in a dairy
management company at the same time he was pushing legislation to
help maintain the profitability of some dairy farms, a review of
records shows.
   Coelho, the House majority whip and third-ranking Democrat in
the chamber, became a limited partner in Dairy Management
Associates in December 1983, according to his financial disclosure
forms.
   When he bought into the partnership with an investment valued at
between $5,000 and $15,000, the California congressman was a member
of the House livestock, dairy and poultry subcommittee. He became
chairman in 1985, a position he held for two years during the time
the controversial 1985 farm bill was passed.
   Coelho's financial dealings have been the subject of public
interest since recent disclosures that a California savings and
loan official purchased a $100,000 bond for Coelho when the
congressman was unable to come up with the money.
   Dairy Management Associates developed a computer software
program for managing dairy herds, allowing farmers to determine
things such as how much milk a cow produces and how much it eats,
Coelho's aides said. The program also is used by veterinarians.
   Fred Hatfield, a Coelho aide, said the congressman was
``comfortable enough in his mind to realize there was no potential
for anything that he dairy or agriculture committee was going to
pass that was going to impact directly on that investment.''
   No law or rule prevents members of Congress from holding assets
that might conflict with their official duties. They are free to
craft and vote on legislation that could affect their financial
interests.
   White House officials and other executive branch employees, on
the other hand, are barred under the basic federal conflict of
interest law from taking government action in which they or their
immediate family has a financial interest unless they obtain a
waiver. The top penalty is two years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   In 1985, Coelho and then-Rep. James Jeffords, R-Vt., introduced
a bill that, among other things, would pay farmers not to produce
milk at a time the industry was beset with surpluses.
   The legislation, which drew the ire of consumer and milk-user
groups, was described by Coelho as a way to ease some producers out
of dairying while retaining profitability for the rest.
   Ultimately, Congress passed legislation that called for modest
cuts in the price support program, but authorized federally
subsidized buy-outs of entire dairy herds.
   Ellen Haas of Public Voice, a self-styled consumer lobby who
fought Coelho on dairy price support measures in 1985, said it
stood to reason that if dairy farmers stay healthy they might be
able to afford to buy computer software programs to manage herds.
She said she had no idea of Coelho's investment at the time.
   One argument for exempting Congress from conflict-of-interest
statutes is that lawmakers must publicly disclose their holdings so
voters can decide whether an official is acting for personal
enrichment.
   Coelho listed his holding as Dairy Management Associates in 1983.
   In four following years, the entry was less descriptive. He
simply stated on his financial disclosure forms that he had an
interest in ``DMA (a California limited partnership).''
   Coelho put his assets, including his DMA interest, in a blind
trust last June.
   Hatfield said Coelho does not fill out his forms personally and
speculated that an aide called the company by its acronym, a
pattern repeated annually.
   Partnership records on file in California _ the most recent was
Jan. 18, 1985 _ show Coelho's general partner in Dairy Management
Associates was Samuel A. Nash, who formerly worked for Coelho's
accountant. The company address was the same as the accountant's
office in Merced, Calif.
   Hatfield, Coelho's aide, said the congressman knew Nash, but not
well. He said Dairy Management Associates has not had an office for
several years.
   Another limited partner in Dairy Management is John Mack, the
former aide to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Mack, a close
friend of Coelho's, resigned last week after an outpouring of
criticism over a newspaper story detailing his attack on a woman in
1973.

<HEAD>Grassroots Concept Gaining Momentum in AIDS Drug Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A novel, grassroots concept in drug testing
pioneered by AIDS victims and their doctors is gaining momentum and
soon may see its first victory with widely expected government
approval of a treatment for a lethal AIDS-related pneumonia.
   Far from the ivory towers of academic medical centers, the
testing is being conducted in a few inner cities hard hit by the
disease where local AIDS doctors and their patients search together
to find treatments that work and disgard those that don't.
   These community programs _ the two major ones are in New York
and San Francisco _ were begun by AIDS patients and physicians
frustrated by the slow pace of academic and government research to
turn out a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome and its
deadly complications.
   ``People with AIDS just decided to do it themselves,'' said
Thomas Hannon, associate director of the Community Research
Initiative, which operates out of an old loft building in New York
where participating doctors administer experimental therapies to
AIDS patients.
   Research data gathered by the New York group and the County
Community Consortium in San Francisco on an aerosol version of the
drug pentamidine pursuaded a Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee earlier this month to recommend approval of the treatment
to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The lung ailment kills
60 percent of all AIDS victims.
   The FDA is widely expected to approve aerosol-administered
pentamidine shortly.
   Pentamidine was approved by the FDA as an injectable drug five
years ago to treat those already suffering from pneumocystis. Many
doctors, though, administered it as a spray. In February, the FDA
expanded pentamidine's use in aerosol form as an experimental
medication under government review.
   As a spray, the drug is delivered directly into the lungs where
the pneumonia infection first shows up. In this form, pentamidine
has been shown to help prevent pneumocystis infection.
   Advocates of the grassroots programs say the FDA advisory
committee's action represents a major breakthrough for the concept
of community-based research and recognition that primary-care
doctors can produce solid, clinical data in the routine delivery of
medical services to their patients.
   The result, they hope, will be to help get effective therapies
to AIDS victims faster. Community programs reach more people, they
say, and so will be able to bring more AIDS patients into clinical
trials, and with more participation, there will be more information
with which to assess the effectiveness of drugs.
   The concept has won the backing of many scientists, drug
companies and the federal government, which is preparing to award
$6 million in grants to develop community-based research programs
throughout the country. In addition to the federal money, the
American Foundation for AIDS Research in April gave $1.4 million to
16 community organizations starting reseach programs.
   Dr. Burton Lee _ a cancer researcher, member of former President
Reagan's AIDS commission and now President Bush's personal
physician _ avidly supports community-based research as an
extension of the work going on in university and government centers.
   These programs, he said, are free of the ``inherent biases'' of
academic studies to exclude the sickest patients. A more
representative sampling, which community programs provide, produces
better results and without any slippage in quality, since many
academic researchers sit on the advisory boards of the community
programs, he said.
   He credits AIDS activists for pointing out the weaknesses in
traditional research. ``The communities have stepped up to bat and
they have tried to speed up the system. They came up with a
constructive idea and I think it's a good one,'' Lee said.
   He added: ``I hope they (community-research programs) spread out
into other diseases. I think it's an excellent model for testing
cancer drugs, diabetes drugs, heart disease drugs and others.''
   Martin Delaney, co-founder of Project Inform, a San
Francisco-based AIDS education group, was an early proponent of
community-based research and still supports it, but he says the
movement has been ``romanticized.''
   Few clinical trials are being done by community groups other
than those in New York and San Francisco, and most of the efforts
are spearheaded by doctors _ not AIDS patients _ and so are not
really the symbols of patient empowerment that advocates describe
them to be, he said.
   ``It's an important part of a broader puzzle,'' Delaney said.
``I don't think it's ever going to replace university-based
research, and there's a limit to how big it can get because of the
time it takes for doctors to participate.''
   One mistake AIDS activists have made is in equating research
with treatment, he said.
   ``The more pressure we put on the research process as being a
way for treatment, the more we confound the research process, and
the politicians find it a nice easy way out, instead of providing
the money for health care,'' Delaney said.
   Yet, the movement is generating ``overwhelming'' interest, said
Lawrence Deyton, assistant director for community research at the
National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   When the government announced its $6 million program, it got
more than 700 requests for information about it. Deyton declined to
say how many applied by the April deadline, but a Capitol Hill
source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said it was more
than 60.
   Deyton estimated that as many as a dozen community-based groups
are now involved in clinical trials for AIDS therapies.
   With more trials, he said, there would likely be more
participation by Hispanics, blacks, intravenous drug users and
women, who are now underrepresented in clinical testing.

<HEAD>Ishida Elected Head of No. 2 Opposition Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's second-largest opposition party elected a
new chairman Sunday to succeed the party leader who resigned in an
influence-peddling scandal.
   Koshiro Ishida, the Komeito Party's new leader, told members,
``I will fight to make the Komeito once more a party that is clean
and trustworthy.''
   Ishida, 58, previously one of four party vice chairmen, was
elected to succeed Junya Yano, who resigned last week when
prosecutors began formal questioning of a Komeito member of
Parliament.
   Katsuya Ikeda of Komeito and Takeo Fujinami of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party were interrogated by police last week.
They are suspected of taking bribes from Recruit Co., an
information and publishing conglomerate.
   The so-called Recruit scandal has resulted in 14 bureaucrats and
businessmen being arrested on bribery and securities law violation
charges.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who has acknowledged receiving
political contributions from Recruit, announced last month he was
resigning to take responsibility for the scandal. But his party has
yet to find a successor who commands widespread respect and is
untainted by the scandal.
   Yano himself was under fire in Komeito, the second-largest
opposition party after the Socialists, for links to an earlier
insider-trading scandal.
   More than 600 party members, including 56 members of the
512-seat House of Representatives and 23 members of the 252-seat
House of Councilors, attended the special party convention in
downtown Tokyo.
   Ishida urged fellow party members to reflect on a ``lack of
seriousness'' among members of Parliament. The new party leaders,
he said, must examine the scandal and reform the party.
   ``I believe this is the way to win public confidence,'' he said.
   Though as an opposition legislator Ikeda had no official power,
he repeatedly lodged questions in Parliament that prosecutors saw
as helpful to Recruit, and he gained financial benefits from
Recruit share transactions.
   Recruit sold bargain-priced, unlisted shares in a subsidiary to
about 160 influential politicians, aides, bureaucrats and
businessmen, allegedly in an attempt to gain influence in the
government. When public trading in the shares began, their prices
soared and buyers made large profits.
   Ishida was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1967.

   Richard and Patricia Stethem have
finally come home after nearly a year in West Germany, now that a
man has been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the 1985
terrorist murder of their son.
   Robert Stethem, 23, a Navy diver, was shot and his body dumped
onto the pavement at Beirut International Airport during the 17-day
hijacking of TWA Flight 847.
   The Stethems, both 53, attended 65 court sessions in Frankfurt,
West Germany, beginning last July, for the trial of Muhammad Ali
Hammadi. ``Nearly a year out of my grandchildren's lives,'' Mrs.
Stethem said.
   The Stethems returned to their Charles County home Thursday
night after Hammadi's sentencing.
   ``We're very confident and really feel he'll stay behind bars,''
Mrs. Stethem said of Hammadi. ``So we feel our trip was worth it.''
   ``They say time heals all wounds,'' Stethem said. ``The pain
hasn't healed yet. And I don't see it happening at this point. But
this verdict has helped a lot.''
   The first order of business was working in their yard and
tending the rose garden Mrs. Stethem maintains to harvest flowers
for her son's grave at Arlington National Cemetery.
   A neighbor mowed the lawn while the Stethems were away, but a
three-week lapse and abundant rain have given it time to grow
knee-high.
   ``We must get on with our lives now,'' said Stethem, a civilian
Navy employee. ``We don't feel in any danger. We've been victims
already ... We'll never have Rob back.''
   In the garage is their son's car, with a vanity license plate
Stethem obtained after his son was killed. ``ROBBIES,'' it says.
   ``We don't drive it much,'' Stethem said.
   The elder Stethem joined the Navy in 1953 when he was 17. He
retired in 1979 but later returned as a civilian employee.
   Mrs. Stethem also was in the Navy, in California, when they met.
She now is a secretary at the U.S. Court of Military Appeals in
Washington.
   There are three other children: Cheryl, 31, a mother of two, and
two Navy sons, Kenneth, 29, and Patrick, 23. ``I had actually tried
to talk all of them into joining the Air Force,'' their father said.
   When the TWA airplane was hijacked in June 1985, Robert Stethem
was part of a crew of Navy divers returning from a routine
maintenance job at a U.S. Navy sewage treatment plant in Greece.
They were on their way back to Little Creek, Va., where Patrick
Stethem now holds the same job his brother did.
   Why Stethem was chosen for execution by the Shiite Moslem
terrorists remains unknown. Another diver, severely beaten at the
same time, lived to testify at Hammadi's trial. Two terrorists
involved in the hijacking remain at large.
   Although the time they spent at the trial in Germany did not
provide answers to all their questions, the Stethems derived a
certain solace. ``I had to be there,'' Ms. Stethem said. ``I had to
know what was happening. I would've climbed the walls wondering
what was happening if I stayed at home.''
   During breaks in the trial, she did volunteer work, typing at
the dental clinic of the U.S. military base where they stayed. ``A
lot of nights, I didn't sleep and walked around and called my
daughter'' in Maryland, she said. Her husband said he read a lot of
books about terrorism.
   A security detail whisked them into the courtroom, which was
inside a prison, and they sat with the prosecutor behind
bulletproof glass. An interpreter translated.
   Now that they're home, the Stethems plan to visit their son's
grave, taking newly cut roses from the garden and news of what
happened to Hammadi.
   ``This is going to be great, going this time,'' Mrs. Stethem
said, ``because I can tell him we just got one.''

<HEAD>Former Autoworkers Rebuild Their Lives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lloyd Ricks helped assemble cars for 16
years until he lost his job. Now he's helping former co-workers
rebuild their lives.
   ``We've all been kicked in the teeth,'' said Ricks, 34. ``Now
it's time to get up and go.''
   Ricks was a chief steward at Chrysler Corp. until the company
ended car production in Kenosha last December, laying off more than
5,000 workers. The Kenosha factory complex, obtained by Chrysler as
part of its 1987 purchase of American Motors Corp., had been used
for automaking for 86 years.
   In his new job as a career counselor, Ricks is part of a network
that is leading people to new jobs and trying to create employment
opportunities.
   Some former workers say they realize the new jobs will pay far
less than they earned at Chrysler, but they have to do something
because unemployment benefits begin to evaporate in the next month.
   ``People are starting to get a little more desperate,'' said
Rick Phillips, 35, an ex-autoworker. ``People were relaxed at first
because we had such a good benefits package.''
   In addition to regular unemployment compensation, the package
included a $20 million ``job bank'' from Chrysler that paid full
salary to 2,200 senior workers for about three months. Workers with
less seniority drew money from a ``sub-pay'' fund that provided
$2,400 to each person.
   ``It's soon going to get to the point where the shoe really
starts pinching,'' said Jack Ward, director of the Workers
Assistance Center established at the local United Auto Workers
headquarters.
   More than 2,000 former autoworkers have sought help at the
assistance center, and about 300 have landed new jobs so far, Ward
said. The center is staffed by other former Chrysler employees who
have been trained to be counselors.
   The center has computer access to job openings in Wisconsin and
Illinois. It also guides people to training programs at a technical
school and provides a workshop where people can improve their math
and English skills.
   Karen Gibson, 42, said that after brushing up her education, she
hopes to get a civil service job. She had a chance to go to a
Chrysler plant in Belvidere, Ill., along with about 200 other
former Kenosha autoworkers, but she and her husband did not want to
leave their home.
   In the meantime, Gibson said she is coping with tight finances,
although she says her unemployment benefits will continue until
around July.
   ``We don't go out anymore,'' she said. ``We don't go out to a
movie, bowling or even a tavern.''
   Some people have started showing signs of alcohol or domestic
problems, said said Karen Geiken, who helps run a ``listening
post'' at the UAW headquarters so laid off workers can receive
emotional support.
   Chrysler is assisting in local economic development.
   ``We're not out of the picture,'' said Thomas Foley, a Chrysler
executive assigned to the effort. He noted that Chrysler is still
Kenosha's largest employer, with about 1,200 people working at the
company's engine plant.
   Workers, state and local officials expressed betrayal when
Chrysler announced the December shutdown in January 1988, saying
they believed the company had promised to continue production into
the 1990s. The state even threatened to sue, but accepted a
settlement that included the creation of Foley's position for one
year.
   Chrysler also donated vacant buildings for office and
manufacturing space, and diverted profits from 1988 Wisconsin car
sales into a trust fund to help laid off workers with living
expenses. The fund totals more than $23 million.
   ``The crisis part of it is over,'' said Kenosha County Executive
John Collins, who noted that officials prepared to deal with the
shutdown before it occurred. ``This was an unusual plant closing.
Normally you don't know about it a year ahead of time.''

<HEAD>Three Square Off In Virginia Statehouse GOP Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three candidates are running in Virginia's
first Republican gubernatorial primary in 40 years, vying for the
chance to oppose Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder in his bid to be the
nation's first elected black governor.
   Virginia Republicans, eager for victory after two straight
shutouts for the statehouse, hold a primary June 13 in hopes of
stirring more voter interest than a convention would attract.
   ``I don't see any signs that the gamble is paying off,'' said
Mark J. Rozell, a political science professor at Mary Washington
College in Fredericksburg.
   The state party chairman disagrees.
   ``I think we're dominating the news,'' said state Republican
Chairman Donald W. Huffman. ``We're getting noticed, and that's
what it's all about.'' The three candidates have held 11 public
debates that have garnered statewide attention, the last one
Wednesday.
   On the Democratic side, Wilder is unchallenged for the
nomination, with selection set for the party convention June 9 and
10. By law, Democratic Gov. Gerald L. Baliles cannot serve a second
consecutive term.
   The Republican primary candidates are:
   _ Former state Attorney General J. Marshall Coleman, 46, who
lost to Democrat Charles Robb in 1981, was squeezed out when he
started talking about another bid for governor in 1985 and then
sought but failed to get the nomination for lieutenant governor.
   _ Rep. Stanford E. Parris, 59, is a former state legislator who
touts his experience in state and federal office. An unsuccessful
contender for the gubernatorial nomination in 1985, he never has
run in a statewide race.
   _ Former Sen. Paul S. Trible Jr., 42, who did not seek
re-election to his U.S. Senate seat last year. Trible is the
front-runner in the contest, according to polls, but his lead may
be narrowing. Parris and Coleman say Trible gave up his seat rather
than face Robb, who won in a landslide over a little-known
candidate.
   All three stress the goals of boosting education and fighting
drugs. Coleman has issued a blanket pledge not to raise taxes.
Parris said he can't rule out any tax increase in four years.
Trible has refused to make a no-tax pledge.
   The polls show Trible favored in a head-to-head contest with
Wilder, who won the state's No. 2 office in 1985 with 52 percent of
the vote. Coleman is about even with Wilder, and Parris trails the
Democrat.
   Republican national chairman Lee Atwater has made the Virginia
gubernatorial campaign a key test for the GOP. ``I'm going to come
down here every week if I have to and do everything I can,''
Atwater said at a Virginia Beach fund-raiser earlier this month.
   President Bush carried the state last year with 60 percent of
the vote. Democrats have captured Virginia's electoral votes only
twice since the end of World War II _ in 1948 and 1964.
   State Republicans last tried a gubernatorial primary 40 years
ago. The most successful primaries for the GOP have been those
conducted by the opposition.
   In 1969, a three-way Democratic primary badly split the party
and led to the election of Virginia's first Republican governor
since Reconstruction, Linwood Holton.
   In 1977, another Democratic primary set up a Republican victory
when former Lt. Gov. Henry E. Howell staged an upset victory over
Attorney General Andrew P. Miller in June. Howell lost that fall to
Republican John N. Dalton.
   After 1977, the Democrats stopped holding primaries and started
winning elections _ in 1981 with Charles S. Robb and 1985 with
Gerald L. Baliles.
   ``When the Democrats quit the primary, a Democrat got elected,''
Rozell said. ``I think there's a connection there.''

   Two freight trains, one laden with propane,
collided in Soviet Central Asia, causing a fire and explosion that
destroyed factories and 13 houses and killed an unspecified number
of people, Tass reported Sunday.
   The official Soviet news agency said the trains collided while
being switched from one track to another on approach lines to a
station in Alma Ata, the capital of the republic of Kazakhstan,
1,800 miles southeast of Moscow.
   ``A huge fire which broke out as a result of the collision
caused a powerful explosion which claimed human lives,'' Tass said.
   It did not say how many people died or how many factories were
destroyed in the accident Saturday night. The news agency said,
``Measures are being taken to help the people and eliminate the
collision's consequences.''
   A commission has been set up to investigate the cause of the
accident.

   American actor Mickey Rourke, at the
center of a controversy over comments he made at the Cannes Film
Festival last week, denied Sunday that he ever gave money to the
Irish Republican Army.
   Rourke was denounced by British lawmakers after a news
conference Friday called to promote his latest movie,
``Francesco,'' in which he plays St. Francis of Assisi.
   Asked then if he ever donated money to religious causes, Rourke
replied, ``Yes I have, to causes in Northern Ireland. Yes, to Joe
Doherty, who is a prisoner in New York City.''
   Doherty, 33, was convicted of the murder of a British Army
captain and sentenced to life in prison in 1981. He escaped from
prison, but was captured by the FBI in 1983 and jailed in New York.
   Rourke issued a statement Sunday through a spokesman saying he
had been involved only in humanitarian aid in Northern Ireland,
never with the Irish Republican Army.
   If people in England ``choose to use this as a platform to
persecute me as an Irish Catholic American, then that is their
indulgence,'' he said.
   O'Rourke has starred in ``Angel Heart,'' ``Barfly'' and ``The
Pope of Greenwich Village.''

   Comic Jay Leno was made an honorary member of
the University of Nevada-Reno's Class of `89 after taking humerous
jabs at members.
   Leno addressed about 1,000 seniors Friday at a graduation lunch.
   To an art major, Leno quipped: ``Art?! So you want to live at

   When a sociology major said he was unsure what he wanted to
pursue after graduation, Leno turned to the audience and said: ``It
is hard to believe the Japanese are ahead of us.''
   Leno was given a silver buckle, a school tie, a plaque making
him an honorary member of the Class of `89 and a bag of tortilla

   Leno, a frequent ``Tonight Show'' host who does commercials for
tortilla chips, is making a weekend appearance at Harrah's Tahoe.

   Tom Brokaw admitted he
was in the position of a ``huckleberry in the path of a hungry
grizzly.''
   But the NBC-TV news anchor went ahead anyway and defended news
coverage of last summer's Yellowstone fires to a group of park
activists.
   ``As trying as it was, I am confident the daily news readers and
viewers had an accurate view of the fires,'' Brokaw said Saturday
of the flames that raged over nearly half of Yellowstone's 2.2
million acres.
   Brokaw's speech came near the end of the two-day conference of

   A 26-year-old television journalist resigned
after management learned she was the subject of a nude photo
feature in the July issue of Playboy magazine, which hits
newsstands this week.
   Shelly Jamison, a news producer, reporter and fill-in anchor is
on the cover of the magazine with her clothes on, and on the inside
with them off.
   ``If they don't fire me, I'll probably quit anyway,'' she told
the Arizona Republic earlier in the week.
   Jamieson has an unlisted telephone and could not be reached for
comment on Sunday.
   KTST-TV News Director Dave Howell said in a prepared statement
Friday that she had resigned, effective immediately.
   ``Neither the article in the July issue of Playboy magazine nor
the use of KTSP-TV trademarks nor the pictures taken on the
premises were done with our authorization, knowledge or
permission,'' the statement said.
   Jamison told Playboy: ``Instead of being a reporter, for once I
felt like being the subject.''

   NBC sportscaster Dick Enberg, who began
his announcing career when he answered a campus newspaper
advertisement 31 years ago, returned to Indiana University to honor
his mentor.
   Enberg, who earned his doctorate at IU in 1962, remembered when
he and retiring broadcast journalism professor Richard Yoakam
handled the first radio broadcast of the Little 500 bicycle race.
   Enberg and Yoakam at one point realized that ``we had no
material left and we had three hours to go.'' Enberg said the
incident taught him his most important broadcast lesson _ be
prepared.
   Enberg, who has won four Emmys and covers everything except
golf, bowling and auto racing, said his favorite sport is baseball.
   It is also the hardest to announce, he said, because the pace is
slow compared to football and basketball.

   The Massachusetts flag now flutters
over a former boarding school seized last week by state officials
who plan to make it a prison.
   But on trees nearby are tacked homemade signs depicting a cow in
prison stripes and one word: ``Never.'' And there is still talk at
the general store of stopping the state from building a 500-inmate
medium-security prison in this isolated town of 800 people and more
than twice as many dairy cows.
   It all started in 1983, when the Pioneer Valley Academy shut its
doors and state officials decided to turn the building into a
prison for drunken drivers. The project didn't go through and the
prison was built instead in Springfield, 40 miles away, but that
wasn't the end of the story.
   ``They came back with the regular prison,'' said Dorothea
Thomas-Vitrac, chairwoman of the town Board of Selectmen.
   To the state, the former Seventh Day Adventist boarding school
perched on a windswept ridge is a place to build a badly needed
prison without having to start from scratch.
   The 240-bed first phase of the prison, which the state hopes to
complete in 18 months, is expected to cost about $25.6 million,
including renovations at the school, said Louise Pepe, spokeswoman
for the state Division of Capitol Planning.
   The second construction phase is expected to cost $20.4 million,
Pepe said.
   For the townspeople it's a battle to preserve the rural way of
life in this little one-store hamlet, where the road in front of
Town Hall is blocked for 20 minutes twice a day while a farming
family moves its cows to and from the barn for milking.
   It's the sort of place where the main road is a country lane
squeezed between stone fences marking pastures that were cleared
when the nation was young. Where the town crew waits for the snow
to stop before plowing, even if it takes days.
   ``We don't sit down and strategize how we are going to convince
people we will be good neighbors, but we will be talking with
them,'' said Deodato Arruda, a spokesman for the state Department
of Corrections.
   She said eight armed corrections officers would be stationed at
the prison around the clock.
   But Susan Reed, co-owner of the general store and president of a
citizens group fighting the prison, said the locals will not be won
over.
   ``I don't think there is any chance of that happening,'' she
said. ``They haven't dealt with us fairly at any time in the past
three years.''
   The town appropriated $100,000 last year _ one-fifth its budget
_ to fight the prison. Two lawsuits challenging the site-selection
process are pending in the courts.
   The owners of the school property also are fighting back,
promising to challenge the eminent-domain process by which the
state seized the property. They say the $5.25 million pricetag the
state has placed on the 730-acre property is not nearly enough.
   Walpole real estate developer Daniel E. Stiar bought the academy
with Newton psychiatrist Gary Jacobsen in 1985 for $3.2 million.
The men had hopes of turning it into a psychiatric hospital, but a
year later they offered it to the state for $10 million.
   ``I wish I had never bought the property. It's been a lot of
aggravation,'' he said.
   The state Inspector General blasted the state's handling of the
matter in a report. He suggested that bumbling alone delayed the
prison at least 18 months and, in some cases, exacerbated the
controversy.
   Inspector General Joseph Baressi said an environmental study
that was to have cost $75,000 ended up costing $645,000. The town
has charged in a lawsuit that the report did not adequately address
environmental issues.

<HEAD>Government Says Rift Remains In Missile Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Sunday said it is
still dissatisfied with a U.S. plan for solving a NATO rift over
whether to hold superpower talks on short-range nuclear missiles.
   But government spokesman Hans Klein told reporters that West
Germany was confident the issue can be resolved before a May 29
NATO summit in Brussels.
   Referring to the U.S. compromise proposal brought back by
Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg after a visit Friday to
Washington, Klein said: ``I think it forms the basis for a
solution, but a solution has not yet been found.
   ``The discussions are continuing,'' Klein said.
   He declined comment on what obstacles remained.
   Klein said that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would send President Bush
a letter detailing the government's position on Monday and that
Kohl would call Bush and other NATO leaders to discuss the matter
in coming days.
   Klein briefed reporters after Kohl met for two hours with
Stoltenberg and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   West Germany has been pressing for prompt superpower talks on
the missiles. The Bush administration orginally had flatly rejected
such talks.
   The disagreement has caused NATO members to choose sides in the
dispute and clouded plans for the NATO summit.
   Under the U.S. compromise plan, negotiations on short-range
nuclear weapons would be linked at some indefinite point to talks
now under way in Vienna designed to reduce conventional forces,
such as tanks.
   The short-range talks would not be held until the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact agreed to sizable reductions in its conventional
forces, which Washington says far outnumber NATO forces.
   Acceptance of short-range negotiations at all represents a major
concession by Bush. For months, U.S. officials had ruled out any
negotiations on the missiles, saying they were essential to the
defense of Western Europe.
   In return, the U.S. wants West Germany to relent in its demands
for ``speedy'' negotiations and state firmly that it rejects the
immediate elimination of short-range weapons.
   Government sources in Bonn, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the obstacles to agreement centered on the latter provision,
the so-called ``third zero option'' under which short-range
missiles would be immediately scrapped.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the U.S.
counterproposal also envisioned postponing until 1992 a decision on
deployment and production of missiles that are faster and travel
farther than the Lance missiles.
   Amid a wave of disarmament feeling in West Germany, Bonn has
resisted a plan to upgrade the U.S.-made Lance missiles deployed in
West Germany against the Soviet-led forces.
   Kohl wants to delay any decision to deploy the new missiles
until at least 1992, after next year's national elections.
   All major West German political parties are united in the demand
for negotiations out of concern their country is the likeliest
battlefield in the event of a nuclear war in Europe.

<HEAD>Judge Asked to Order Release of Computer Tapes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge is expected to rule soon on
efforts of researchers to gain access to computer tapes that could
shed new light on the Iran-Contra affair and other backstage
dealings in the Reagan White House.
   U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey has asked for written
arguments by Thursday on whether some decisions by President Bush
to block access to the tapes are subject to court review.
   The government is asking for a summary judgment that would in
effect dismiss the claims of the National Security Archive and
others for access to the computer messages.
   The National Security Archive is a private repository of
government information operated as a division of The Fund for
Peace, a New York non-profit organization.
   Other plaintiffs include the American Historical Association and
American Library Association. They say the tapes contain
information that does not exist anywhere in paper form.
   At issue in the case are backup tapes containing messages sent
on the Professional Office System, known as PROFS, in the National
Security Council and other agencies in the Executive Office of the
President.
   Printouts from the tapes were used by the presidentially
appointed Tower Commission and the congressional Iran-Contra
committees in their investigations of the affair that rocked
President Reagan's second term. They were also introduced as
evidence in the trial of Oliver North, who was convicted of aiding
and abetting in the obstruction of Congress, shredding and altering
documents and accepting a gratuity.
   The plaintiffs say there are more, 144 tapes in a system used by
100 to 150 people on the NSC staff, and 32 in a system used by more
than 300 in the Executive Office of the President, and that such
messages are routinely destroyed.
   ``The fundamental issue in this case is whether the NSC and the
EOP may authorize the routine destruction of information generated
on the PROFS computer systems without complying with the
requirements of the federal records laws,'' attorney Katherine A.
Meyer of Public Citizen Litigation Group, representing the
plaintiffs, told the judge in a memorandum.
   ``Plaintiffs' argument confuses the medium with the message,''
Justice Department attorneys replied. ``PROFS is simply a tool for
conveying information.''
   The government takes the position that the system is a
substitute for calling a colleague on the telephone or talking with
him or her in a hallway.
   The Justice Department told the court that ``the bulk of the
information generated on that system is transitory and does not
constitute record material.'' It said users of the system have been
instructed repeatedly to make a printout of any information that
legally amounts to a government record.
   Ms. Meyer, on the other hand, argued that the NSC and executive
office ``have made a blanket determination that, except in rare
instances, the information generated on the PROFS systems is simply
not covered by any of the federal records laws.''
   If the judge denies the government's motion for summary
judgment, Ms. Meyer said the plaintiffs will file a motion to
obtain additional information they need in order to show that ``the
defendants have violated those laws by routinely deleting and
ultimately deciding to destroy the information that existed on the
PROFS system at the end of the Reagan administration.''
   Defendants in the case include Bush and Donald Wilson, the
archivist of the United States, who the plaintiffs accuse of
``failing to exercise proper oversight of the NSC's and EOP's
routine destruction of information generated on the PROFs system.''

   American television networks continued to report
from Beijing over the weekend, but in most cases without that
important component of television coverage _ pictures.
   ``We're now on the basis of hand-carrying everything out,'' said
CBS' Dan Rather, who left for Tokyo after the network's live
coverage was shut down Friday night in the middle of the season
finale of ``Dallas.''
   What videotape the networks were obtaining was filmed illegally
under martial law, and correspondents were reduced to giving live
reports by telephone. Tension was increasing Sunday as troops were
rumored to be readying a move on the protesters.
   ``There's no question that we're handcuffed by not being able to
broadcast live,'' said CNN anchor Bernard Shaw in a telephone
interview from Beijing, where he remained on Sunday. ``The
government can pull the plug on CNN to keep the story from getting
to the world, but we are not their problem. ... If they don't pull
the telephone plugs, and I expect them to do that, we'll be able to
get word out.''
   Network television coverage had for days brought Americans
inspiring pictures of the remarkable uprising. On Friday, the
government got fed up and ordered coverage to cease. The networks
broke in live to cover that development, ABC even taking its
cameras into CNN's control room in Beijing. ``Dallas'' viewers got
an unexpected, real-life cliffhanger when CBS News broke in with
scenes of Rather attempting to negotiate with Chinese officials.
``I do protest, in the most respectful manner,'' Rather said, to no
avail. He reluctantly signed off one last time as a technician in
the background shut off the satellite dish.
   ``I loved the fella who called in and said, `I was watching Dan
Rather and `Dallas' broke in,''' Rather joked in a telephone
interview from Tokyo on Saturday.
   There were some calls of complaint from ``Dallas'' viewers. But
taking to the air was a matter of being able to broadcast the most
recent CBS News footage _ dramatic scenes of demonstrators being
beaten by police.
   ``The object became to delay it as long as we possibly could,''
Rather said of the halt in coverage. ``China is a society where
authority is everything. That's why I kept asking for something in
writing.''
   Rather's coverage from Tiananmen Square had been shut down
earlier. As he rushed back to the hotel, Lane Venardos, director of
special events, was on the air arguing in a hotel corridor with two
uncomfortable-looking Chinese officials.
   ``The scene in the control room and in the hallway was just
bizarre. I was stalling to get fed everything we had coming in to
us,'' said Venardos, also in Tokyo on Saturday. ``I was using every
ploy I could, including getting them to put it in writing. I knew
he (Rather) was on his way back.''
   Rather said the breakneck ride back to the hotel included a
collision with one of the many bicycles clogging the street, but no
one was hurt.
   Meanwhile, at CNN, Shaw went on live as executive producer Alec
Miran vainly negotiated with Chinese officials.
   ``I certainly was angry,'' Shaw recalled. ``I tried not to show
that on the air. My object was to disgorge the last information we
have. But to have your pencil, your notepad, your microphone and
your camera snatched out of your hands is very disturbing.''
   ``There was frustration, but also a sense of, I don't know if
pride's the right word, but just knowing that what you're doing is
right,'' said Miran, also still in Beijing. ``There were very mixed
emotions, because on one hand, you want to stand up and scream
about freedom of the press. On the other hand, that doesn't mean
anything here.''
   When his arguments at one point had flustered a Chinese
official, Miran recalled, ``he said, `This is China.' In his mind,
that explained everything.''

<TEXT>
   There were tall ones, shorts ones; chubby
ones, skinny ones; noisy ones, quiet ones.
   The 600 boys and girls looked perfectly ordinary, but they had
one thing in common: all were test-tube children. They gathered in
the sunshine Sunday with their balloons and ice creams for a
reunion at the clinic one might call their birthplace.
   The guests ranged from infants a few weeks old to 11-year-old
Louise Brown, the world's first test-tube child.
   They released 1,295 yellow balloons, one for every test-tube
baby conceived at Bourn Hall Clinic. They posed on the lawn for a
group photograph, and Louise planted a walnut sapling in memory of
the late Patrick Steptoe, the man who co-founded the clinic and
pioneered the test-tube baby technique.
   ``Never before have so many test-tube babies been gathered
together in one place at one time,'' declared medical director
Peter Brinsden, in a speech welcoming Bourne Hall's progeny. ``You
are the message of hope for other people around the world.''
   More than a decade has passed since Louise Brown's birth in
England on July 25, 1978 heralded the dawn of what became known as
in vitro fertilization, or IVF.
   The technique invented by Steptoe and his partner, Robert
Edwards, involves removing the egg from the mother's ovary,
fertilizing it with sperm in a dish, and returning the egg to the
womb to grow into a normal embryo.
   For women who could not conceive because of such afflictions as
blocked fallopian tubes, IVF was their salvation. But it remains
difficult, painful and expensive, and only some 10,000 babies
worldwide have been born by IVF.
   ``So many of you suffered pain, anxiety, stress, tension, and
then fortunately all of you had joy and happiness,'' Brinsden told
the parents gathered outside the clinic.
   ``So it was worthwhile for you,'' he said. ``But I'd like you
just to bear in mind that for every one of you, there are seven or
eight or nine others who have not been as fortunate as you. So let
us think today also of the people who have not been as lucky,''
   Among the children enjoying the jugglers, brass band and Punch
and Judy show, was Greece's first test-tube child, Christine
Iordanidou, 7.
   Standing with Christine and her parents was another Greek
couple, Dimitri and Diamanto Marsellos, and their 4-year-old
test-tube son John.
   Mrs. Marsellos said she had only one fallopian tube and it was
blocked. The couple visited American doctors who told her nothing
could be done. Then after hearing about Christine Iordanidou on
television, they visited Steptoe and Edwards.
   ``Dr. Steptoe accepted us,'' said Marsellos. ``I said, `all over
the world we were told there was no hope. What makes you so sure
you can help?' and Dr. Steptoe said something I will never forget.
He said: `Your case is one of the most difficult cases, and we
accept difficult cases.'''
   Louise Brown has entered her pre-teens thoroughly at ease with
fame. Wearing a pink dress and white ribbon in her long, golden
hair, she faced the cameras patiently while her parents fielded
reporters' questions.
   ``I think the party's absolutely marvelous. I never thought when
Louise was born that we would one day see so many children. It's
lovely,'' said Louise's mother, Leslie, 41.
   Louise's father, John, a 48-year-old truck driver, said the
couple often receives letters from parents of test-tube children,
asking whether such children need anything special for their
upbringing.
   ``We just say, do the natural thing; bring up the children,''
Brown said.
   The Browns have a second test-tube daughter, 6-year-old Natalie.
   Steptoe died last year, but Edwards was at the party and used
the opportunity to deliver an impassioned appeal for more research
and financing for techniques of assisted conception.
   ``When you think that maybe one couple in 10 is infertile, we've
got a lot of work to do,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A former press secretary to Jesse Jackson
contends in a new book that the 1988 presidential candidate was an
abusive and sexist boss who was ``incessantly critical and totally
egocentric.''
   Elizabeth O. Colton, who served as Jackson's press secretary for
about two months in early 1988, describes being shoved from behind
by Jackson and says the candidate literally stepped on her toes to
show his displeasure on several occasions.
   ``He abused me and most other staff members in countless ways,''
she writes.
   Colton's account of Jackson's unsuccessful campaign for the 1988
Democratic presidential nomination is ``The Jackson Phenomenon: The
Man, the Power, the Message,'' being published June 26 by Doubleday.
   Jackson declined to comment on her descriptions of him or
incidents Colton recounts, saying he had not read the book.
   But Jackson, in an interview, disputed the notion Colton was a
campaign insider. He said she worked as his traveling press
secretary for only five weeks and left about the time of the
``Super Tuesday'' round of Southern primaries.
   ``Liz was with us for about five weeks,'' Jackson said. ``Some
of that time she spent moving to Washington, and then she got sick.
And she left around or before Super Tuesday ... (when) our campaign
was just really getting started.
   ``I don't know why I should either read or react to that,'' he
said.
   Asked if he wanted to read the book, Jackson replied, ``It's not
a priority.''
   Colton, in an interview, said Jackson was ``totally wrong''
about her length of service and said her illness was only a brief
flu. She said in the book that she worked as press secretary from
Jan. 24 until March 28, when she was informed Jackson no longer
wanted her on the road with the campaign. She became a consultant
to the campaign on April 4 and remained until mid-June.
   She said she was relieved by the move, and much of her book is
devoted to descriptions of Jackson delivering ``constant
unwarranted abuse'' to her and other staffers, sometimes in public.
   ``The reality for me was that it was very unpleasant to be
around someone who was incessantly critical and totally egocentric
to the extent that no one else mattered at all,'' she writes.
   ``It was also frightening. I knew it would become very difficult
for me to defend my position as this man's press secretary. At
first I believed in him. I still believed in most of his issues,
but I could no longer throw my heart behind the man as I had at the
beginning.''
   She said she believed her personality irritated Jackson, but
that Jackson's treatment of women did not match his public support
for women's rights. Female staff members, she wrote, ``were fully
aware that they were treated as second-class citizens by Jackson.''
   She describes entering a news conference following a debate with
other Democratic candidates in Atlanta, and says Jackson first
asked her to check on the scene, then pushed her when he saw
television cameras on other candidates.
   ``As I began walking in to check the scene to report back to
him, I suddenly felt my breath being knocked out of me from behind.
It was Jesse's fist smashing into my back. He was pushing me aside
and snarling in my ear, `Get the ... out of my way,''' she wrote.
   She said Jackson deliberately stepped on her feet as she talked
to reporters aboard the campaign jet.
   ``He stepped squarely on my feet, and it hurt,'' she wrote. ``I
was so shocked that I figured it must have been an accident, but
several more times convinced me, sadly, that he'd done it on
purpose to signal me to quit talking.''
   Yolanda Carraway, who directed Jackson's Washington office, said
in an interview that Colton frequently dropped off Jackson's
traveling party for personal reasons and was given a
Washington-based job that allowed her to begin writing her book
while still on the campaign payroll. She said Colton never came
into the Washington campaign office.

<HEAD>Congressmen Recommend Simplier Purchasing Regulations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush faces a ``last chance
opportunity'' to reform Pentagon procurement, according to two
congressmen who recommend reinforcing the authority of an
acquisition czar and simplification of current regulations.
   Reps. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, and Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of the panel's
subcommittee on investigations, also suggested a system of rational
tradeoffs between military requirements, cost and performance, and
training for procurement personnel without reliance on outside
consultants.
   ``If reform is to occur, the implementation must be specific and
measured, and not simply the expression of a philosophical
statement,'' the congressmen said in a four-page letter to Bush.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will be submitting to the
president sometime soon a defense management review, which will
include proposals based on the 1986 Packard Commission report, the
lawmakers said.
   The Packard Commission studied ways to reform the Pentagon's
system of buying weapons.
   Aspin and Mavroules proposed a ``checklist of critical actions''
for Bush to consider, including clarifying the authority of the
undersecretary of defense for acquisition and establishing a better
relationship between the Defense Resources Board, the Defense
Acquisition Board and the Joint Requirements Operational Committee.
   An improved relationship of the three organizations which
oversee the defense budget, acquisition and requirements would
result in ``checks and balances that will promote the planning,
scheduling and budgeting that produces tradeoffs.''
   ``For those of us who have worked on this issue the last three
years _ attempting to create a `cultural change' within the
Department of Defense _ this current effort to make acquisition
reform work is a last chance opportunity,'' the congressmen said.
   Last summer, allegations of fraud and corruption in the
procurement process rocked the Pentagon.

<HEAD>Lukens Getting His Day in Court to Answer Sex Charge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jury selection was scheduled to begin
Monday for the trial of U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens on a misdemeanor
charge of having sex with a 16-year-old girl.
   If convicted, the 58-year-old Republican could go to jail for up
to six months. Also weighing in the balance is the political future
of the four-term congressman who has survived other allegations
during his career.
   Five days before the start of the trial, a 35-year-old sexual
molestation case involving Lukens was brought to light by a Detroit
television station.
   WJBK reported that Lukens, then a salesman, was taken in for
questioning in Michigan in 1954 on suspicion he had sexually
molested a young girl. The station, citing unidentified police
sources, said the case was dropped because the child's parents
refused to press charges.
   Lukens declined comment on the Detroit report, other than to say
there was no case.
   He also wouldn't talk about the trial, saying the details will
be used in his defense. He has said he is innocent.
   ``He's going to let it work out in the proper forum, and that is
a court of law,'' said William Jarrell, Lukens' spokesman in
Washington.
   Rita Mangini, the assistant Franklin County prosecutor who is
handling the case, expects the trial to last no more than a week.
   The case drew national attention when a Columbus television
station on Feb. 1 broadcast a secretly recorded videotape that
showed Lukens apparently offering a government job to the mother of
the 16-year-old after she asked him why he was ``messing around''
with her daughter. WSYX said it recorded the Nov. 11, 1988, meeting
at a fast-food restaurant a day after Anna Coffman approaced the
station with her story.
   Lukens told Ms. Coffman, who wore a concealed microphone, that
he thought her daughter was an adult, according to the videotape.
   The FBI reviewed the tape and said it found no evidence of
bribery or extortion.
   Lukens was indicted Feb. 23 on a charge of contributing to the
unruliness and delinquency of a child. The misdemeanor charge
stemmed from the allegation that Lukens, who is divorced, had sex
with the girl in his Columbus apartment last year.
   The charge carries a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail and a
$1,000 fine.
   Lukens refused to discuss the accusations against him for three
weeks following the first reports of the allegations. He made his
first public comment on the day of the indictment, issuing a
statement proclaiming his innocence.
   He has vowed to serve out his term, which expires in 1990.
   Several Republicans have indicated an interest in Lukens' seat
should the political opportunity arise.
   Lukens has raised about $20,000 for his defense, which Jarrell
said is expected to cost about $60,000. One event in Washington
produced $10,000.
   Lukens was first elected to Congress in 1966 and served two
terms before he was barred from seeking public office for five
years for not filing campaign reports on time. That election law
was changed before the five-year period expired, and he was
appointed to the state Senate in 1971 to fill an unexpired term.
   In 1974, while in the state Senate, he fought allegations that
he accepted $1,000 in campaign contributions from Korean
businessman Tongsun Park during his first stint on Capitol Hill. He
denied the charge, presenting the results of a voluntary lie
detector test.
   He returned to Congress in 1986 and was re-elected last November.
   In 1984, Lukens was stricken with throat cancer. He has
undergone six operations, radiation therapy and treatment with an
experimental drug that left him with a raspy voice and a
chronically dry mouth. He said the cancer is in remission.

   David Keith, the actor who played
former Lt. Col. Oliver North in the TV miniseries ``Guts and
Glory,'' was arrested for alleged felony drunken driving after
hitting another car, authorities said.
   Keith, 35, was allegedly speeding at about midnight Saturday
when he rammed a car making a U-turn, injuring a woman riding in
the other car, Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy George
Ducoulombier said Sunday.
   The woman, whose name wasn't released, was treated at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for neck pain, Ducoulombier said. Her
condition wasn't available Sunday.
   ``He was charged with the more serious felony violation because
of the speeding and the injury,'' the deputy said.
   Keith's blood alcohol level was tested at more than .18 percent,
he said. The standard blood alcohol level defining drunken driving
is .10 percent.
   Keith was driving a 1988 Ford Mustang and hit a 1988 BMW,
Ducoulombier said. Keith, the driver of the BMW and an unidentified
woman traveling with the actor were uninjured.
   He was freed early Sunday morning after posting $2,500 bail, the
deputy said.
   Keith's film credits include ``An Officer and A Gentleman'' and
``Lords of Discipline.''

   The 17-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories appears to be at a crossroads, with both
Palestinians and Israelis threatening to escalate the use of force.
   In their latest leaflet, Palestinian underground leaders vowed
to kill an Israeli soldier or settler for every Arab killed by
Israeli troops.
   Israel's army is on the offensive against Palestinian unrest,
killing 33 Arabs and wounding 435 so far this month. The government
also has increased economic pressure, putting the Gaza Strip's
700,000 Palestinians under curfew for eight days and requiring
permits to work in Israel.
   Palestinian leaders have so far persuaded protesters to use just
bottles and stones in clashes with Israeli troops. But with 496
Arabs killed since the uprising began in December 1987, Palestinian
intellectuals say there is growing pressure to use guns.
   ``The ground is shaking under those who urge restraint,'' said a
prominent Palestinian. He spoke on condition of anonymity, saying
he feared arrest if he spoke openly.
   ``There is a feeling among some young activists that the only
way to make the Americans force Israel to make policy changes is
for Israel to pay a higher cost, to send Israelis back in
coffins,'' he said.
   Concurrently, there is growing pressure from Israeli
right-wingers, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, to use
whatever force is necessary to crush the violent protests.
   How far Israel would actually go in using military force remains
to be seen. But one official said Israel needs to widen the
battlefield and use ``administrative violence'' to hit Arabs in the
pocketbook and other aspects of day-to-day life.
   ``We need to fight in all fields of life, not just the
streets,'' he said.
   Such action, the official said, would persuade Palestinians to
adopt a more realistic view of possible political settlements and
give up militant nationalist aspirations.
   The crackdown on Palestinian workers is especially severe since
wages from Israel, which were $700 million in 1987, accounted for
about one-third of the occupied territories' gross national
product. About 50,000 of the 700,000 Palestinians from the Gaza
Strip and 60,000 of the 1 million West Bank residents work in
Israel.
   On the Palestinian side, there have been several signs of
escalating violence.
   On Friday, for the first time, there was a gun battle between
troops and armed Palestinians. One soldier died and three Arabs
were killed. Palestinians also have stepped up killings of
suspected army collaborators.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat told reporters in Baghdad, Iraq, that
Palestinians may be forced to use arms if Israeli forces continue
to kill Arab demonstrators.
   And in an interview with the Kuwaiti daily Al Watan, Mohammed
Abbas, a leading PLO figure, called for the use of firearms. ``We
are convinced that diplomacy has a time and the stone has a time,
but I see that the time nas now come to use arms in support of the
intefadeh,'' he was quoted as saying.
   But there are questions whether Palestinians would use arms or
whether such threats are rhetoric to make Israel back away from
hard-line policies.
   Arieh Shalev, a retired general and West Bank military governor
in 1974-76, said Palestinians lack adequate weapons to mount an
effective guerrilla war. He said Palestinians risk harsh Israeli
reprisals if they fight with firearms.
   Palestinian moderates have expressed concern the PLO would
abandon the policy of unarmed resistance and risk losing
international backing.
   ``I am against escalation on our side. I think we should try to
keep the intefadeh bloodless,'' said Ziad Abu Ziad, a Palestinian
activist who edits the biweekly Hebrew-language newsletter Gesher,
or bridge, aimed at an Israeli audience.
   But he said Palestinian anger is rising over the lack of Israeli
response to demands for an end to the occupation, the number of
protesters killed and wounded and collective punishments such as
curfews and work restrictions.
   ``These measures are responsible for any escalation that occurs
on the Palestinian side,'' he said.
   Faisal Husseini, who heads a Palestinian study center in
Jerusalem, said Israel is at a crossroads. The government must
decide whether to accept Palestinian demands for statehood or
continue with a policy of confrontation.
   ``The situation is more dangerous now. People are so angry,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Britain Expels Soviets For Spying, Soviets Retaliate</HEAD>

   Britain ordered eight Soviet diplomats and three
journalists out of the country for alleged espionage, and the
Soviet Union responded with an identical set of expulsions, the
British Embassy said Sunday.
   ``It's a mirror-image act of retaliation,'' Sir Rodric Q.
Braithwaite, Britain's ambassador to Moscow, told a news conference.
   Britain said its expulsions were legitimate and that the Soviet
response was unjustified. The Soviet Union had no immediate comment
on either set of expulsions.
   On Friday, Soviet Ambassador Leonid Zamyatin was called to the
British Foreign Office in London and told that 11 Soviets were
being expelled for ``activities incompatible with their status,'' a
Foreign Office spokesman said.
   The spokesman would not detail the specific allegations, but
``incompatible activities'' is diplomatic parlance for espionage.
   The Foreign Office spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping
with British custom, said Britain had not planned to make public
the expulsions and did so only after the Soviets retaliated.
   On Saturday night, Braithwaite was summoned to the Soviet
Foreign Ministry and told that 11 Britons were being expelled, the
British Embassy's political counselor, Roderic Lyne, said.
   In each case, eight diplomats and three journalists were
expelled, Lyne said. Each group was given 14 days to leave the
country.
   In London, Sir Geoffrey Howe, Britain's foreign minister, called
Britain's action ``a measured action in respect of established
misbehavior'' and termed the Soviet response unjustified. Howe said
Britain has ``incontrovertible evidence'' of wrongdoing by the
expelled Soviets.
   He also urged the Soviet Union to cease an alleged buildup of
intelligence gathering in Britain, saying that was an area excluded
from the general improvement in relations between the countries.
   Britain's Independent Television News radio reported the Soviets
were caught spying on military installations. The Soviets were not
identified.
   The Britons ordered out included Embassy Second Secretary
Michael Anderson; Second Secretary Adam Noble; Third Secretary Paul
Sharp; Vice Consul Helen Pickering; Naval Attache Capt. Christopher
Meyer; Assistant Naval Attache Lt. Cmdr. Christopher Watson;
Assistant Military Attache Maj. Nigel Shakespear; and Warrant
Officer Laing Purfit of the Defense Ministry staff.
   Jeremy Harris of the British Broadcasting Corp., Ian
Glover-James of Independent Television News and Angus Roxburgh of
the Sunday Times of London also were given two weeks to leave the
Soviet Union, Lyne said.
   Roxburgh said he and the other British journalists were told by
Braithwaite that the Kremlin had ordered them and the diplomats to
leave ``because we had engaged in impermissible activities.''
   ``Needless to say, I find the accusation ludicrous, almost too
silly to comment on,'' Roxburgh said.
   BBC's deputy director-general, John Birt, said the BBC would
``vigorously resist'' Harris' expulsion.
   Glover-James said in a telephone interview that he and the other
Britons were accused of ``impermissible activity on the territory''
of the Soviet Union.
   ``I'm not guilty of any spying, lawbreaking or any impermissible
activity,'' he said.
   Britain also declared on Friday that three former Soviet Embassy
workers, who already have completed their tours, were not welcome
back, Lyne said. The Soviets responded by declaring three former
British Embassy staff members ``persona non grata,'' he said.
   Asked why the British government kept its expulsions quiet, the
Foreign Office spokesman said, ``We look at these on a case-by-case
basis and in this case we decided not to initiate publicity. But
obviously once they (the Soviets) retaliated, it just broke.''
   But George Robertson, a spokesman for the opposition Labor
Party, said Britain's Conservative government had kept a ``bizarre
and inexplicable silence,'' and added: ``The British public deserve
a lot more information before they will accept that this is
justified.''

   The centennial-year election to settle,
once and for all, whether Helena or Anaconda should be Montana's
capital city has taken an unexpected turn, a long turn, several
hundreds miles to the east.
   The leader in early returns in the $1-a-vote election is
Bismarck, N.D.
   As of May 19, says Jim Bouck, chairman of the Anaconda
Centennial Committee, the vote totals were 159 for Anaconda, 219
for Helena and 387 for Bismarck.
   Anaconda, a small former copper-smelting town west of Butte, has
long contended that Helenans stole the 1894 election for state
capital. Helena won by 1,906 votes out of a total 55,000 votes cast
_ in a state with only 51,000 registered voters.
   The centennial committees for the two cities are sponsoring the
voting with the charge of $1 per vote considered in keeping with
the flavor of the original election.
   The two top vote-getters in the decidedly non-binding primary,
to be counted July 4, will go on a general election ballot in
November. Final results will be announced at the Nov. 8 centennial
ball _ to be held in Helena, not Anaconda.

   Small children are at the controls of
airplanes again. Now the family of a 9-year-old Virginia boy says
he is the youngest pilot to fly across the United States.
   Elliott Shoup, of Falls Church, Va., came to visit his
grandparents in Portland in a single-engine Piper he flew from the
Quantico Marine Corps Air Station, Va., to Hillsboro Airport, just
west of Portland.
   ``It was good all the way,'' Elliott said after the six-day trip
ended Friday.
   He was accompanied by his father, Frank Shoup, a pilot and
former aviation instructor who now works at the Pentagon.
   The pair flew for only three or four hours each day, with
Elliott peering over the controls from a large pile of cushions.
   ``It's pretty hard because you have to do so many things,'' the
boy said.
   In 1988, 9-year-old Tony Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., flew his father's Cessna 210 to Boston, but Elliott's
family said Tony was almost 10 when he made the flight.
   It was not certain if Elliott's record will be counted because
no National Aeronautics Association observer was on the plane, but
Elliott's father said that wasn't the point.
   ``We didn't do it to beat a record or anything,'' he said. ``We
came here for Grandma's apple pie.''

   After 30 years in the Air Force,
retired combat pilot Art Johnson is on a busman's holiday, building
radio-controlled model airplanes and other flying machines.
   ``Other flying machines'' covers such things as a near-lifesize
witch he frequently sends zooming at rooftop level on a broom-like
contraption, and a flying doghouse with Snoopy from the ``Peanuts''
cartoon.
   A three-time national scale-model champion, Johnson now competes
with a radio-controlled model of a B-26 bomber like those he flew
in 65 combat missions over Europe in World War II.
   It took five years to build, has a nine-foot wingspan and is
powered by two four-cycle engines. The radio controls operate the
throttle, rudder and aileron, turn on landing lights, open bomb bay
doors and release replica bombs.
   The witch flies with the help of a section of black umbrella
that serves as an airfoil, sort of like a hang glider.
   Snoopy's doghouse uses the overhanging edges of the roof as
wings.
   ``There's a personal accomplishment and satisfaction of flying
something you've built,'' said Johnson, 69.
   ``But it's not as easy as it looks. I could teach someone to fly
a full-sized aircraft easier than a model,'' he said.

   Hood College President Martha E. Church
received a present from each of the 283 graduates at commencement,
but they all got her the same thing _ again.
   As Ms. Church handed out the diplomas Saturday, each student
passed her a Lego block to be used, according to a note from the
seniors, for a new library the school is building.
   She appeared relieved, said Don Schumaker, the college's
assistant director of communications. ``She was expecting jelly
beans or cat food. Her nickname growing up was Junior Jelly Bean,
and she has two cats, Rama and Fita,'' he said.
   It was the fifth year that Hood seniors have conspired to
surprise Ms. Church on graduation day. In past years, they've given
her pennies, marbles, pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, even live goldfish
in little plastic bags.
   ``This has really been a lot of fun so far,'' Ms. Church said.
``I haven't told the students this, but it's been helpful for them
too. I haven't had to shake a clammy hand in four years. It helps
them relax.''

   Leaders of Reform Judaism gave their
support Sunday to a ``reverse freedom caravan'' planned next month
to mark the 25th anniversary of the murder of three civil rights
workers in Mississippi.
   The board of trustees of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, the central body of Reform Judaism in North America,
also called on the movement's 820 synagogues and 1.3 million
members to support the caravan.
   The action is believed to be the first by any Jewish group in
support of the caravan, which will depart from Meridian, Miss., on
June 21 by bus. It will arrive in New York on June 24 after a
stopover in Washington.
   Interdenominational services, rallies and meetings with members
of Congress and other public officials will be held along the way,
culminating with an interfaith program in New York City.
   The caravan will memorialize Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner
and James Earl Chaney, three youths who were killed while
participating in a ``Freedom Summer'' project in Philadelphia,
Miss., in 1964.

   Having two heads of state for commencement
speakers might seem inspirational to many graduating seniors.
   But the presence of President Bush and France's President
Francois Mitterrand at Boston University's 116th commencement
Sunday dampened the spirits of some of the 5,400 graduates and
their friends.
   ``It means no booze, no beach balls, no fun,'' said Ron Kleiman,
24, a recent BU graduate who yelled to his graduating friends as
they walked to their seats.
   ``We had to throw away the champagne bottles,'' said graduating
senior Dave Wheeler, 21, who received a degree in political
science. ``But I guess it is worth the trade-off if it means having
the president here.''
   But if some students were ambivalent about the extraordinary
pomp and circumstance surrounding their graduation, many of the
more than 30,000 alumni, friends and relatives in the packed
audience were thrilled.
   Some, like Saul Holtzman, 72, a member of the class of 1939,
came from as far away as Albuquerque, N.M., for the ceremony.
   ``It's great, really exciting,'' said Holtzman, sitting with
other members of the 50th reunion class. ``It's a lot different
from 50 years ago. (Republican presidential candidate) Alf Landon
was our speaker then.''
   Adel Anbar, 23, said his parents traveled from the small Persian
Gulf nation of Qatar for his graduation when they heard that Bush
and Mitterrand were the featured speakers.
   ``It was a good reason for my parents to come,'' said Anbar.
   Bush and Mitterrand, and their wives, Barbara Bush and Danielle
Mitterrand, were welcomed with applause and cheers.
   The heartiest and most surprising reception was reserved for
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who, since his failed presidential
campaign, has been under siege locally for the state's fiscal
crisis.
   Some of the students wore peace symbols on their gowns and the
words ``Bush Knew'' on their mortar boards. A few held up protest
signs when Bush began his address.
   ``I'm wearing this because Bush knew about the contras, but went
ahead and made Oliver North the scapegoat,'' said Claire Connelly,
22, a graduating senior from South Boston. ``It's an imperialist
presidency and Bush shouldn't be there.''
   Another group of demonstrators handed out leaflets outside the
stadium, protesting the policies of the Bush administration.
   But most of the students, a number of them holding tiny French
and American flags, said they were pleased with the commencement.
They often interrupted Mitterrand's speech, cheering his
exhortations for environmental protection when he said: ``The Earth
is our planet, let us save it.''
   ``We're pretty glad to have Bush here,'' said graduating senior
Joe Curley, 22. ``We're in this with our eyes open. We can't argue
too much about the world we are going out into.''
   ``We're all pretty bourgeois,'' said his friend, Dave Wheeler,
who is going on to law school.
   Another graduating senior, Mary Hansel, 22, from Rochester,
N.Y., said some in her class feared that Bush and Mitterrand would
overshadow them.
   ``But mostly it is exciting. Most people can't believe we are
here,'' she said.

   A pastor told a biblical story of
suffering and tragedy Sunday for parishioners, friends and

   David Eenigenburg, pastor of Sauk Village Bible Church, read
from the book of Job, a story of the suffering of a righteous man
struck unexpectedly by tragedy when his seven sons were killed.
   ``The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,'' the passage
reads.
   Tom Ireland, 32, and his 7-year-old daughter Jamie, were the
only survivors of Friday's fire in this suburb south of Chicago.
They were away from home when the fire broke out and killed
Christine Ireland, 27, and her children Nicole, 5; Thomas Jr., 4;
James, 3; Robert, 1{; and Michael, 5 months.
   The family had attended the church for about six months,
Eenigenburg said.
   ``It was a touching service,'' the pastor said in a telephone
interview afterwards. ``There were a lot of tears, and I had a hard
time restraining myself ... when I imagined myself in his shoes.''
   About 200 people, more than usual, packed the church. Many wrote
out checks to help the family, Eenigenburg said.
   ``Jamie has just been overwhelmed with gifts, clothes, that sort
of thing,'' he said. ``I think people are really rising to the
occasion.''
   The funeral home handling services for the victims has
``underwritten all the immediate expenses with the hope they'll be
reimbursed,'' Eenigenburg said.
   Ireland had been laid off all winter from a steel mill and just
started a job at a barrel factory in Blue Island.
   ``He had no benefits coming, certainly no insurance to handle
the cost of the funerals,'' Eeignenburg said.
   Clayton Marcuson, a childhood friend of Christine Ireland, said
he was organizing an all-night fund-raising event for the family
June 24.
   ``She was fun, easy to get along with,'' Marcuson said. ``She
always loved children.''
   The Sauk Village Hall and the Calumet Federal Savings and Loan
in Sauk Village are accepting donations for the family.
   The cause of the blaze, which gutted the family home, was not
determined, but fire investigators said it was accidental and
started in the living room.

<HEAD>Uproar Fades to Silence in Sex-Assault Claim Against Sen. Brock Adams</HEAD>

   Washington state politics were rocked last
September when a young woman alleged that Sen. Brock Adams had
invited her to his home, drugged her and sexually assaulted her.
   Eight months later, no criminal charges or lawsuits have been
filed. Adams goes on with his legislative work in Washington, D.C.
   The Democratic senator has repeatedly denied the allegations
made by Kari Tupper of Seattle, who said the incident occurred in
March 1987 when she was a secretary on Capitol Hill. Adams, who
served as transportation secretary under President Jimmy Carter,
accused Tupper of demanding $400,000 in ``hush money'' from him.
   Law enforcement authorities said charges were never filed
against Adams because there was a of lack of evidence. Threats of
lawsuits were tossed back and forth between Adams and the Tupper
family, who had been old friends of the senator.
   ``I discussed (the case) with my attorney, and it is very
difficult for a public official who has been a victim of false
statements to take legal action,'' Adams said Thursday in a brief
telephone interview from Washington, D.C. ``I have put the matter
behind me and am moving forward to do my job in the Senate.''
   Adams would not comment on whether the case would affect his
decision on whether to run for re-election in 1992.
   ``I have just put this whole thing behind me and that's all I
have to say. ... I suggest others do the same,'' he said.
   Kari Tupper, now 26, married and a graduate student in English
at the University of Washington, did not return messages relayed
through her mother and on her husband's answering machine at work.
   Her mother, Sylvia Tupper, who once dated Adams, said the case
was on hold, and would not discuss it in detail.
   ``Certain things are being tracked down,'' Mrs. Tupper said.
``The thing is not dead. That's all I can tell you.''
   Karen Marchioro, chair of the state Democrats, said she did not
see that the case had affected Adams politically.
   ``I think he's doing a good job,'' she said. ``The only people I
ever hear mention this are press people.''

   About 400,000 people waved banners, listened to
speeches and marched through downtown on Sunday in support of the
pro-democratic movement in China.
   The crowd cut across all economic and age barriers as it tied up
traffic for five hours in this British colony, which is to revert
to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Even staff from the Xinhua News Agency, the unofficial
representative of China in Hong Kong, wrote a banner to support the
pro-democracy marchers who have refused to end their massive
protests in Beijing and other Chinese cities.
   After marching for three hours, the protesters entered a race
track and filled the stands and the field as they listened to
speeches by community leaders, movie stars and lawmakers.
   The rally ended after two and a half hours but a steady flow of
marchers continued to enter the course for two hours. Organizers
estimated the number of protesters at 400,000.

<HEAD>It's Take Two For Former Congressman's Perjury Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In October, he lost in his attempt to be tried
and acquitted of 10 federal counts of perjury before Election Day.
In November, he lost his seat in Congress.
   Monday brings former Rep. Pat Swindall's long-awaited day in
court, barring a last-minute delay.
   The defense has sought to move the trial out of Atlanta because
of publicity, but U.S. District Judge Richard Freeman has deferred
any ruling on that request until he tries to seat an impartial jury
in Atlanta.
   The trial is crucial to the 38-year-old evangelical
conservative's political future. The two-term Republican has
maintained a political organization, and says he would like to run
against U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., in 1992 _ if he is acquitted.
   Swindall was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts, each of which
carries a penalty of 10 months to five years in prison.
   The indictment accuses Swindall of lying under oath in early
1988 to a federal grand jury investigating his dealings with an
associate, later convicted of money laundering, and with a federal
undercover agent posing as a money broker for probable drug dealers.
   Swindall, running for re-election, waived his right to file
pre-trial motions last October and asked that the case be tried
immediately, with the congressman acting as his own attorney.
Prosecutors agreed, and the trial began two weeks before Election
Day.
   But U.S. District Judge Robert Vining stopped the trial after
Swindall campaign mailings, proclaiming his innocence, arrived at
the homes of at least two jurors. Thirteen days later, on Nov. 8,
Swindall lost his 4th District seat, in Atlanta's eastern suburbs,
to Democrat Ben Jones, after a campaign marked by mud-slinging on
both sides.
   In the indictment, Swindall is accused of lying about his
meetings with two men: Charles LeChasney, an associate and admitted
money launderer, and ``Mike Martinez,'' actually Mike Mullaney, a
federal agent posing as a money broker.
   Tapes of the encounters, leaked to the news media last year,
show Swindall, who was seeking an $850,000 loan to help pay for his
luxurious Stone Mountain home, being told by ``Martinez'' that the
money probably was connected with drugs and might pose problems for
the congressman.
   Swindall told the agent that if the money came to him through
LeChasney's company, ``it becomes Charles' problem.''
   The indictment contends that Swindall lied in concealing from
the grand jury his discussions on how the tracks of the money would
be covered to protect him.
   Swindall also told the grand jury that he ``never chose to
borrow the money,'' although he acknowledged receiving a $150,000
check from LeChasney.
   Swindall, who conducted an animated defense in court last fall,
has been represented in pre-trial motions this time by attorney
Richard Hendrix, a former federal prosecutor.
   The former congressman has kept a low profile in the weeks
preceding the trial. He did host a party for some 200 supporters at
his home _ which is up for sale _ earlier this month. Standing on
his diving board, he urged them to ``pray that justice will be
served.''

<TEXT>
   Workers were still working Sunday to stop
a small leak of radioactive water at the Pilgrim nuclear power
plant, a spokeswoman said.
   ``The leak was identified early in the week and the first repair
plan was dropped,'' said spokeswoman Elaine Robinson. ``They had
originally planned to use a gasket to seal the leak, but later
decided it needed welding. We will not restart until the leak has
been repaired.''
   The leak was one of two incidents cited in a letter by Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis and Attorney General James Shannon to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Friday, calling for a suspension
of the plant's license to operate.
   Robinson said the leak was minor and posed no threat to the
public.
   ``It's really more of a drip, with only about 30 to 40 drips per
minute,'' she said, likening the problem to a leaking bathroom
faucet.
   The leak was detected last Monday in a water cleanup system
located in the plant's reactor building, but does not directly
affect the reactor.
   In a separate incident Thursday night, the reactor's protection
systems were unintentionally activated when an operator threw a
control switch prematurely.
   Dukakis and Shannon are among many officials who have cited
problems at the plant since it was authorized to begin a gradual
restart in December, more than two years after equipment and
management troubles shut down the facility.

<HEAD>Sir John Hicks, Nobel Prize-Winning Economist, Dies at 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economist Sir John Hicks, winner of the Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1972, has died, his family
announced Sunday. He was 85.
   Hicks died Saturday at his home at Blockley, Gloucestershire,
west of London. No cause of death was announced.
   He was for many years a lecturer at the London School of
Economics, Oxford and Cambridge Universities and at the University
of Manchester.
   During his career, Hicks frequently criticized monetarism, which
advocates the control of money as the chief method of stabilizing
the economy. The theory, which now prevails in Britain, argues that
strict government control of the money supply is necessary to
prevent high inflation.
   Hicks once commented, ``What is wrong with monetarism is that it
tries to put all the kinds of inflation into the same box.''
   His early work paralleled that of J.M. Keynes, who believed the
money supply is largely unimportant in determining demand. Hicks
was was a pioneer in streamlining the general economic equilibrium
theory, which explained the determination of prices and allocation
of resources in an economy.
   It was for work on the equilibrium theory that Hicks was awarded
the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1972, sharing it
with Kenneth Arrow of Harvard University. The prize was established
in 1968 by the Central Bank of Sweden as a memorial to Alfred
Nobel, who established the five Nobel Prizes.
   Hicks had been knighted in 1964 for his services to economics.
   Born in Warwick on April 8, 1904, Hicks was educated at Clifton
College before winning a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford,
from which he graduated in 1925.
   London School of Economics was a lecturer from 1926 to 1935.
   In 1935, Hicks married another distinguished economist, Lady
Ursula Hicks, and they collaborated on numerous books on economic
theory. She died in 1985.
   Hicks was a Cambridge lecturer, for three years from 1935, after
which he became professor of political economy at the University of
Manchester, where he stayed until 1946.
   Later he became Official Fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford,
then Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford University
until his retirement in 1965.

   President Bush said Sunday he was prepared to
defend his press secretary's description of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a ``drugstore cowboy,'' a slang term
suggesting a phony.
   However, French President Francois Mitterrand, appearing at a
joint news conference with Bush, rejected the characterization made
last week by presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   The press spokesman had used the term ``drugstore cowboy'' in
saying that a rash of disarmament offers from Gorbachev were just
part of a public relations campaign.
   ``I think that one must be wary of caricatures,'' Mitterrand
said. ``Mr. Gorbachev is worth very much more than that.''
   Bush then said, ``So much for Marlin. In fairness to the man
...''
   At that point, Fitzwater, standing next to the stage, said,
``No, don't defend me.''
   The president responded, ``No? Don't defend you? Which I would
be perfectly prepared to do.''
   The questioning then turned to another subject.

<HEAD>Man Who Saved Civilians At My Lai Breaks 20-Year Silence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hugh C. Thompson Jr. blinks away tears
when he remembers the first child he rescued from the My Lai
massacre. Pulled from a ditch, she was covered with the blood of
the women, old men and children who filled it.
   ``I had a child about that size,'' the former Army helicopter
pilot said.
   Thompson has broken a long silence about the events of March 16,
1968, when U.S. soldiers killed more than 400 civilians in a
Vietnamese hamlet.
   The 23-year-old warrant officer and his crews were the only
soldiers at My Lai to rescue rather than kill. They saved the
little girl, who was about 4 or 5 years old, and a group of 12 to
16 old men, women and children.
   Thompson, now an oil field helicopter pilot and a part-time real
estate agent, rarely talks about the massacre because of the
memories.
   He testified at an Army inquiry in 1970, but wouldn't talk to
reporters until TV producer Michael Bilton made a second request
for an interview, backing it up with a sample of his work.
   Thompson said the quality of that work persuaded him to talk to
Bilton, whose documentary on My Lai airs Tuesday on the Public
Broadcasting System show ``Frontline.''
   Others who testified at the Army inquiry said soldiers wanted
revenge for buddies killed at My Lai, a desolate cluster of rural
villages said to be a Viet Cong stronghold.
   ``They were supposed to go through and kill off the enemy,''
Thompson told The Daily Advertiser of Lafayette. ``There's only one
problem. There weren't any enemy.''
   The inexperienced soldiers led by Lt. William Calley Jr. left
their base at 7:22 a.m. on March 16, 1968.
   ``They went in with blood in their eyes and shot everything that
moved,'' Thompson said.
   Thompson's mission was to look for enemy fire, and tell his
gunship escorts where it was coming from. But as his helicopter
darted over the trees, he couldn't see any shooting.
   The routine reconnaissance turned into a nightmare.
   He and his men flew over a ditch full of bodies: old men, old
women and babies. There were no young men; nobody who might have
been a soldier. Thompson couldn't figure out how all those people
got into the ditch, or why they might have run out of their bunkers
into the open.
   ``I remember coming upon one lady in the field. She was wounded,
thrashing around on the ground in a lot of pain. We called on the
radio for assistance to help her out,'' he said.
   ``An individual (American soldier) walked up to her, nudged her,
kicked her, stepped back and blew her away.''
   In the ditch, someone moved.
   Thompson and his two crew members went back. His crew chief,
Glen Androtta, disentangled a little girl from the mass of bodies.
   Thompson radioed for help while he held the child, who was
apparently unwounded but covered with blood.
   ``I couldn't understand what was happening. I couldn't
understand why it was happening,'' he said quietly. ``We're
supposed to be the good guys.''
   The helicopter took the child to a hospital, then returned.
   Thompson touched down between American officers led by a
lieutenant and an open-air bunker where an old man, two old women
and about a dozen children cowered.
   ``I set down there and walked over ... and said, `Hey, there's
some old women, old men and kids in a bunker here. Can you get 'em
out?'
   ``He (the lieutenant) said the only way to get them out was with
a hand grenade.
   ``I said, `Hold your men right here and we'll go over and see if
we can do better than that,''' Thompson recalled. He said he didn't
know if the lieutenant was Calley, who was the ranking officer at
My Lai.
   Asked about a story that he told one of his gunners to shoot the
lieutenant if he tried to interfere, Thompson said, ``Something
like that was said. I don't recall the exact words.''
   Thompson said he motioned the children and old people around to
his helicopter, then called in his gunships, which picked up the
little group.
   ``They would have gotten killed,'' he said.
   In October 1969, the Army, crediting Thompson with saving the
lives of 16 children, awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross.
   Calley was ordered court-martialed the next month on charges of
premeditated murder of 109 Vietnamese.
   He was convicted in March 1971 of first-degree murder in the
deaths of at least 22 villagers. Calley was the only one found
guilty out of 25 officers and enlisted men who initially were
charged and six who went on trial. He served three years of house
arrest at Fort Benning, Ga.
   Knowing that he did all he could and did right at My Lai doesn't
make Thompson's memories any easier.
   ``We're supposed to be the ones on the white horse in the big
white hats,'' he said, shaking his head.

   The People's Liberation Army, caught in
transition between revolutionary force and modern army, has been
thrust into a key role in the standoff between the government and
pro-democracy students.
   As time passed and the government-ordered suppression of the
monthlong student revolt failed to materialize, the PLA appeared
ill-prepared or reluctant to carry out its mission.
   Young soldiers waiting in convoys on the outskirts of the
capital took cigarettes and drinks from protesters and listened
intently as students lectured them on the campaign for democratic
reform.
   Some flashed V-for-victory signs when their trucks retreated
away from the city.
   It was harder to decipher how senior military officers were
reacting to the most serious challenge to the social order the
Communist Party has faced in its 40-year rule.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping's one remaining official post is as
head of the Central Military Commission, and it is believed to have
been Deng who ordered the crackdown on the student movement.
   The 84-year-old Deng is certain to have the support of other
older officers who served in the old Red Army and continue to
regard the PLA as the last bastion of revolutionary integrity.
   Less certain is the backing of younger officers, the PLA's new
ranks of professionals who may share some of the students' concerns
about the slow pace of political reform in China.
   The PLA played a major role in restoring order during the
chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when fighting between
different leftist factions brought China to the brink of civil war.
   Since then, however, the nation's trust in the ideological
purity of the PLA has begun to slip.
   In the early 1980s, the army abandoned Mao Tse-tung's concept of
a guerrilla ``people's war,'' in which the army would beat back an
attacker through sheer numbers and revolutionary fervor.
   Deng has reduced the number of troops by about 1 million since
1985, when China fielded 4.2 million soldiers. He has brought back
a ranking system abandoned for 23 years, emphasized better training
and sought to create a modern military force.
   The PLA, however, has been saddled with severe budgetary
restrictions as government funds were channeled to economic
modernization programs. About two-thirds of defense industry
factories have been switched to making civilian goods to help boost
national production and exports.
   From 1950 to 1980, defense spending accounted for 17.2 percent
of China's state expenditures, the PLA says. In 1988, it received
only 7.49 percent of the budget. Defense spending in actual terms
is expected to fall about 6 percent this year after inflation.
   In the past, PLA ranks were filled with young people attracted
to the prestige of a military career and the possibility of
escaping rural poverty. PLA members still command respect, but the
low pay and harsh living conditions have made recruiting more
difficult.
   In well-off rural areas, families commonly pay off local
officials to keep their sons off local quota lists for enlistment.
   One recent report in the official media said the army is ending
up with soldiers who are mentally retarded or illiterate or who
have criminal records.
   Many recruits are eager to finish their term and return to
civilian life so they can make money to buy the material comforts
young people have come to expect. Such recruits are now listening
with sympathy when students their own age chant ``the people's army
belongs to the people.''

   French President Francois Mitterrand expressed
optimism Sunday that differences between the NATO allies over
European short-range nuclear missiles can be reconciled before next
week's NATO summit.
   Mitterrand, appearing at a joint news conference with President
Bush, was asked whether he was acting as an ``intermediary'' or
``conciliator'' in the missiles dispute.
   He replied: ``The only role I play is the role that is my
natural role as a member of the alliance. But I'm not particularly
there to act as a mediator.
   ``Obviously, I'm happy if views can be reconciled and I believe
_ I think that they can be reconciled,'' Mitterrand said. ``I think
that we have now the elements of ideas that could form a decision
that will be taken just in a week's time.''
   He added: ``I think that the decision that will be taken will be
found positive from the point of view of all members of the
alliance.''
   The West German government has been advocating immediate
negotiations with the Soviet Union on short-range nuclear missiles.
But the United States and Britain have balked, saying that Moscow
should first reduce its numerically superior conventional forces.
   Later in the news conference, Mitterrand noted that ``on this
problem, like on other problems, at the outset people have
diverging views, different opinions. But the important thing is to
come to a meeting of the minds and to achieve a common answer. And
this has always been the case in the alliance.''
   The French leader was asked whether the Cold War has now come to
an end.
   Mitterrand replied that ``as far as the Cold War is concerned,
one thing is clear _ and that is that we are moving out of the Cold
War, and the chances are that this will be true for a very long
time. There will be moments when things will be more difficult,
doubtless, but I don't imagine _ I don't see us slipping right back
into the Cold War.''
   He added: ``Of course, anything is possible. A lot will depend
on the trend of developments within the Soviet Union.''
   Mitterrand was asked whether he agreed with recent remarks by
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater in which the spokesman
described Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a ``drugstore
cowboy.''
   Mitterrand replied: ``I think that one must be wary of
caricatures _ Mr. Gorbachev is worth very much more than that.''
   Earlier, the French president had shared commencement speaking
duty with Bush at Boston University. Mitterrand devoted his speech
remarks largely to the environment and said, ``The earth is our
planet, so let us save it.''
   He departed for France in late afternoon.

they stop fighting the government and help end the decade-old civil
war.
   In Iran, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov met with
Iran-based Afghan guerrillas and said their view of the future of
their country conformed with the Soviet view, Tehran radio reported
Sunday. Vorontsov added that the guerrilla leaders had been invited
to Moscow, the radio said.
   Najib also appealed to the exiled king to do what he can to help
restore peace to Afghanistan.
   ``These people hold the destiny of future generations in their
hands,'' Najib told the Loya Jirgah, the supreme governing body.
``A non-aligned and free Afghanistan cannot be obtained through
military activities.''
   The Loya Jirgah, or Grand Assembly, met over the weekend to
extend a nationwide state of emergency for six months and empower
the president to add another six months if he deems necessary.
   The state of emergency was declared Feb. 18, three days after
the last Soviet troops left Afghanistan and ended their nine-year
military involvement in the country.
   The Loya Jirgah, meeting for only the 17th time since it was
formed in 1702, is comprised of government officials, businessmen
and tribal leaders. It meets to decide matters of pressing national
importance.
   In the assembly's opening session Saturday, Najib said a
three-member commission would be appointed to negotiate with the
guerrillas anywhere, at any time and on any terms.
   On Sunday, he went a step further and made his pitch to a dozen
field commanders operating inside the country.
   His moves were seen as signs the Kabul government is feeling the
pressure of defending itself without Soviet troops.
   ``It is a great burden to be a field commander and I realize
they have borne a great and arduous weight, unlike the luxury their
leaders have enjoyed in exile'' said Najib, who uses one name.
   Najib said the government would help them if they stopped
fighting and agreed to reconciliation.
   ``They can have power and sovereignty in their locality. They
can have full military rank and full military authority and they
can keep their weapons. They will be permitted their own autonomous
administration,'' he said.
   Najib said his government met with field commanders inside
Afghanistan and with guerrilla leaders in neighboring Pakistan,
where the Moslem guerrillas are based, but he gave no details of
the talks.
   Asked if the dozen field commanders named by Najib had been
contacted by the government, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad
Nabi Amani said, ``it's a safe assumption.''
   Amani said 15 field commanders either sat in on the Loya Jirgah
sessions or sent representatives. Five of them were specifically
invited by the president, he said.
   In a major policy reversal, Najib also appealed to Mohammad
Zahir Shah, 74, the former king who has been living in exile in
Rome since he was overthrown by his cousin, Mohammad Daud, in 1973.
The ruling communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan
seized power from Daud in an April 1978 coup.
   ``He could be central to peace in this country,'' Najib said.
   The Afghan guerrillas are split into two alliances, the larger
Pakistan-based Sunni Moslem cooalition, and the minority Shiite
Moslem alliance based in Iran.
   Both groups engaged Soviet soldiers in heavy fighting after the
1979 invasion. But they have been at odds since the formation of an
interim Afghan government in which the Shiite alliance is not
represented.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Vorontsov as saying
that the guerrilla spokesman ``was against foreign intervention in
Afghanistan, and has expressed support for a broad-based government
in Afghanistan.''
   ``Our stance conforms completely with this view, and I have
asked the leaders of the (Iran-based) alliance to visit Moscow, and
they have said that they will think about the timing of such a
trip,'' he said.

<HEAD>Boys Who Picketed Judge's Chambers Say They Got Favorable Ruling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WILLMAR, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two boys who picketed a courthouse urging
a judge to keep their younger siblings in a foster home away from
their homeless mother said Sunday that the judge has decided the
case to their liking.
   ``It was worth it,'' 13-year-old Peter Carnes said of the
after-school protests he and 12-year-old brother Danny staged twice
last month outside the Kandiyohi County Courthouse. ``At least for
now we know they are not going back'' to their mother.
   The boys said their mother, Margo Senescall, wanted to regain
custody of her two youngest children to beef up her welfare checks.
Based on their own childhood experiences, the two boys said their
9-year-old sister and 10-year-old brother would be subject to abuse
under her care.
   Ms. Senescall could not be reached for comment. Telephone calls
to the homeless shelter in Minneapolis where she lives were not
returned. Her attorney, Jay Liedman of Willmar, declined to comment.
   Peter Carnes said Sunday that Judge John Lindstrom has decided
for now to keep the younger children in a foster home in Willmar,
not far from the foster home where he and Danny live.
   Lindstrom said he could not comment because custody cases are
confidential.
   ``I have made a decision and that's about all I can say,''
Lindstrom said Sunday. ``There is nothing currently before me.''
   Doris Lyman, the boys' foster mother, confirmed Peter's account
of the judge's decision.
   ``As far as I know, it's 100 percent true,'' Lyman said. ``For
now, that's the way it's going to be, but how long nobody knows.''
   Danny Carnes said the boys decided to picket after they pleaded
with the judge unsuccessfully to throw out their mother's request.
   ``We talked to the judge but he didn't listen,'' Danny said.
``We told him our brother and sister might get killed and he said,
`That's the chance we have to take.'''
   ``The picketing was Peter's idea,'' he said. ``At first we felt
weird but after a while we got used to it and it did us some good.''
   The boys said their picketing in this west-central Minnesota
town of about 13,600 prompted letters on their behalf and a lawyer
to volunteer his services.
   It was the lawyer who informed them of the judge's decision
because the boys were not allowed to attend court hearings, Peter
Carnes said. The lawyer, Pete Hendrickson of Minneapolis, told the
boys there is still a chance their mother could regain custody of
the younger children, Peter said.
   Lindstrom has said custody cases are subject to review until
children reach adulthood.
   He said in an interview that he was not swayed by the picketing.
He said he relied strictly on evidence and testimony in court,
where he heard conflicting stories.
   ``I admire their courage,'' Lindstrom said. ``They are obviously
deeply concerned. I think it's (the picketing) a very legitimate
forum for them to express their concerns.''
   Peter Carnes said he was sexually and physically abused by men
while he was under his mother's care. He says he complained about
the abuse, but she did nothing.
   ``She acts like she cares, but she doesn't,'' he said.
   Danny Carnes says he also was physically abused by men while
with his mother. The boys' parents divorced before the boys entered
elementary school and Ms. Senescall agreed about seven years ago to
put the children in foster homes, Peter and Danny said.
   Willard Carnes, 52, of Renville, said he couldn't care for his
children because his job as a farm hand keeps him away from home
for long stretches and he doesn't earn much money. He said his
ex-wife is unfit to care for the children, but he wouldn't give
reasons.
   ``They sure won't have the best of care, I'll put it that way,''
he said.
   The boys' picketing prompted Orvel and Janet Bratsch of rural
Renville to write a letter to Lindstrom. The couple knew the Carnes
family before the parents divorced.
   ``Please believe Danny and Peter!!'' the Bratsches wrote. ``They
know what they are talking about! Please do not send these children
to live with their unfit mother.''

<HEAD>Officials Discuss Asylum Request of Soviet Pilot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkish and Soviet officials on Sunday
discussed the asylum request of an air force pilot who fled the
Soviet Union under fire in a MiG-29 fighter jet.
   Capt. Alexander Zuyev requested political asylum in the United
States on Saturday after he fled his country and landed in the
Turkish city of Trabzon.
   A deputy spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Nazim Belger, said
Zuyev's request for political refuge in the United States ``is
being evaluated under the framework of Turkey's international
obligations and practices.''
   Zuyev, 28, was wounded in the right arm when he was fired on
while taking off from a Soviet airport north of the Black Sea City
of Batumi, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu.
   The pilot was operated on and was in good condition at the Black
Sea University Medical School Hospital in Trabzon, Batu told
reporters.
   In a statement carried Sunday by the Anatolia News Agency, the
Turkish General Staff said Turkish radar spotted the MiG-29 and
other Soviet planes in pursuit.
   It said Turkey did not sent any planes to intercept the MiG as
it was about to land and that the Soviet planes chasing it turned
back before entering Turkish airspace.
   The Foreign Ministry said the MiG was flown back to the Soviet
Union Sunday after a group of Soviet technicians who arrived
earlier in the day removed missiles and other weaponry from the
plane.
   The Soviet Union asked Turkish officials to extradite Zuyev,
saying he stole the jet and shot and wounded a sentry guarding the
aircraft at Tskhakaya airfield, the Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   Belger said Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz held talks with Soviet
Ambassador Albert Cernishev on the matter earlier in the day. He
did not elaborate.
   In Washington, a U.S. State Department spokesman said on
Saturday that the United States ``has been in touch with the
Turkish government'' about the case.

<DATELINE>LA CHORRERA, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite an archbishop's exhortation
that churches not be used for political purposes, three opposition
leaders were applauded by the congregation when they attended Mass
Sunday.
   Guillermo Endara, who ran for president in the May 7 election,
and vice presidential candidates Ricardo Arias Calderon and
Guillermo Ford entered the San Francisco church at midmorning to
prolonged applause from about 1,000 worshipers.
   Outside the church more than 100 people waved green and white
flags of the opposition. As Endara entered and left they shouted,
``Justice!'' and ``Endara presidente!''
   Word had circulated since Saturday that the three would attend
Mass in La Chorrera, 18 miles west of Panama City.
   Independent observers of the May 7 election said Endara and
other opposition candidates trounced the government slate lined up
by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega by a 3-1 margin. Noriega is the
commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces and controls the
government.
   On May 10 the government annulled the elections and also on that
day paramilitary gangs attacked Endara, Ford and Arias with iron
staves.
   Arias Calderon was the candidate for first vice president and
Ford for second vice president.
   Monsignor Marcos McGrath, archbishop of Panama City, issued a
letter on Saturday lamenting political rallies at several churches
last Sunday.
   Panama's Roman Catholic church claims the devotion of a great
majority of the country's 2.5 million citizens. It had been
generally quiet on political and social issues until the election
annulment and the beating of the opposition candidates. It then
spoke out against suppression of ``the popular will.''
   But McGrath said in his letter the church had advised the
opposition of its ``discontent'' with the rallies in churches ``in
the hope that this kind of action will not be repeated.''
   Sunday's Mass was delayed as dozens of journalists gathered
around the front of the altar. The Rev. Jose Luis Andrade, the
parish priest, appealed for ``respect for the sanctity of this
house of God'' and the area was cleared.
   ``These gentlemen (the opposition leaders) are Christians and
can come to Mass here. But we are here to honor God, and this
cannot be converted into a political act,'' he told The Associated
Press before saying Mass.
   The government on Saturday prohibited ``marches, meetings,
public demonstrations or caravans of vehicles'' by any political
organization until at least June 5.
   A government statement said the action was taken because of the
scheduled visit this week by delegates from the Organization of
American States.
   The opposition leaders said the ban was unconstitutional and on
Saturday they were in a motorcade that drove through Panama City
drawing cheering crowds.
   The foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and
Tobago, accompanied by OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares, are
due in Panama Tuesday to try to help resolve Panama's governmental
crisis.
   The OAS last week approved a resolution that held Noriega
responsible for ``abuses'' and called for ``a transfer of power in
the shortest possible time.''
   Opposition leaders say they will tell the OAS delegation that
results of the May 7 election be recognized and implemented.
   ``The annulment must be annulled,'' Arias Calderon said.

<HEAD>Daughter Asks Court To Declare De Kooning Mentally Incompetent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The daughter of artist Willem de Kooning, who is
said to have Alzheimer's disease, asked a court to declare him
mentally incompetent to manage property worth up to $150 million,
according to ARTnews magazine.
   De Kooning, 85, lives in East Hampton on Long Island, and
continues to paint daily with the violent, slashing strokes that
have earned him fame as one of America's most prominent living
artists.
   His daughter, Lisa, and his attorney, John Eastman, have filed a
petition in state court in Mineola requesting they be named
co-conservators of the artist's assets, which have an estimated
worth of $100 million to $150 million, according to ARTnews' summer
issue.
   Eastman, reached by telephone Sunday at his East Hampton home,
confirmed that the petition was filed in mid-February, but refused
to comment further.
   The battle over representing de Kooning began two years ago when
his longtime dealer, Xavier Fourcade, died, ARTnews said.
   Formal exhibitions and sales of the painter's works were on hold
while offers were considered by his daughter, whose mother is
artist Joan Ward, and de Kooning's wife, Elaine, the magazine said.
   Two weeks after de Kooning's wife died of cancer, his daughter
and Eastman filed the petition.
   The petition said that although the artist ``continues to paint
daily and masterfully ... his physical and mental condition
prevents him from performing everyday tasks and managing his
finances,'' according to ARTnews.
   Dr. Frederick Mortati, a Huntington physician, submitted an
affidavit to the court which said ``it would appear ... Mr. de
Kooning suffers from Alzheimer's disease,'' the magazine said.
   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible disorder
whose symptoms include gradual memory loss, impairment of judgment,
disorientation, personality change, difficulty in learning and loss
of language skills.
   The petition said Ms. de Kooning is the sole beneficiary of her
father's will and last year received about $25,000 a month from
him, according to ARTnews.
   Ms. de Kooning, an animal rights activist and amateur sculptor
who is married and has a child, has lived in a house her father
built for her on his property since 1983.
   No date has been set for a hearing on the petition, according to
ARTnews. Court officials were not available for comment Sunday.
   If granted, the petition would give Ms. de Kooning and Eastman
control over the artist's representation and his assets, which
include $7 million in real estate, cash and securities and more
than 300 paintings.
   The average worth of each painting is estimated to be between
$300,000 and $650,000. However, his ``Pink Lady'' sold at a 1988
Sotheby's auction for $3.6 million.

   Amnesty International appealed Monday to the
leaders of French-speaking nations, gathering this week for a
summit in Senegal, to halt widespread human rights abuses in their
countries.
   In a 38-page report issued for the third Francophone Summit,
which opens Wednesday, the human rights organization listed what it
called ``very numerous cases of human rights violations in more
than 30 francophone countries.''
   Included are frequent cases of torture, secret imprisonment,
lengthy detention without trial and bad prison conditions.
   Among the cases cited is that of Salet Gaba, The Associated
Press correspondent in Chad, who has not been heard from since his
arrest in June 1987.
   Last year, Amnesty said it heard Gaba had died after being
mistreated in prison, and it called for a government inquiry. There
has been no response from President Hissene Habre's government.
   About 40 countries in which French is spoken _ ranging from
Canada to Haiti to Madagascar to Vietnam _ are expected to attend
the Dakar meeting.
   The countries criticized by Amnesty include two that refuse to
attend meetings of the group: Algeria and Syria.
   While most of the accusations of human rights abuses were
directed at former French colonies in Africa, even France and
Switzerland did not escape criticism.
   The Swiss were criticized for refusing to allow conscientious
objectors to perform civilian service as an alternative to their
draft duty, and the French for requiring objectors to serve two
years of alternative service, compared with just one year for army
draftees.

   A professor on paid sabbatical from Brooklyn
College has become the main North American spokesman for Panamanian
strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   Carlos Russell has appeared on radio and U.S. network television
as a spokesman for Noriega, the commander of the Panamanian Defense
Forces and de facto ruler of Panama, the Daily News reported.
   Russell, 54, a professor of educational services and a native of
Panama, also serves as Panama's alternate representative to the
Organization of American States.
   A college spokesman, Barry Rosen, told the News that Russell was
awarded a one-year fellowship leave at $30,000 _ half his usual pay
_ last August. Russell said he has asked the college to extend his
leave for another year.
   He told the college, part of the City University, that he would
use the fellowship to ``increase knowledge in the culture and
politics of West Indians with particular emphasis on Panama.''
   Russell said he became Panama's alternate OAS representative
``four or five months ago'' and receives $3,000 monthly in salary
and expenses from that country.
   Rosen said the college was enquiring to see if Russell's status
had changed since he became a Noriega representative.
   In a telephone interview Sunday, Russell said the United States
has ``a fixation on Noriega.''
   ``If they have a fixation on him they do not have to discuss or
question the real reason why the United States is in Panama _ to
attempt to retain control of the Panama Canal after the year
2000,'' he said.
   The Panama treaties, which went into effect in 1979, are to give
Panama sovereignty over the canal and several American military
bases by the end of the century.
   Russell claimed that opponents of Noriega were responsible for
voting irregularities in the recent general election. ``American
money was used by the opposition to defraud the election,'' he said.
   Independent monitors say the opposition won the May 7
presidential election by an overwhelming margin, despite tampering
by Noriega's forces. A government-appointed election tribunal
nullified the election.
   Among his other activities, Russell led a series of tours of
Uganda by journalists and educators in the 1970s and wrote a series
of articles in the Amsterdam News, a New York City newspaper,
casting Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in a favorable light.

   President Bush's sister was on her way to hear her
brother speak at Boston University's commencement Sunday when she
accidentally struck three police officers with her car, causing
minor injuries.
   The officers had been directing Nancy Bush Ellis to a parking
area near the campus where 30,000 graduates and their families
gathered to hear Bush and French President Francois Mitterrand
deliver the keynote address.
   Investigating officers reported there was no apparent negligence
on the part of Mrs. Ellis and no charges were filed, said police
spokeswoman Linda Orlando.
   Mrs. Ellis, a resident of Lincoln, stopped to talk to the
officers after she encountered a roadblock.
   She then put the car in reverse and the car suddenly lurched
backwards, knocking the officers down.
   ``One officer was hit in the knee with the car's fender, another
was hit by the door as it flung open and a third was swept back
about 10 feet by the door itself,'' Orlando said.
   She said Mrs. Ellis' Audi sedan then bashed into an police truck
stationed at the roadblock. ``That's what stopped the vehicle,''
Orlando said.
   Two of the officers had minor cuts and bruises and the one who
was swept back 10 feet suffered minor head and neck injuries,
Orlando said. All three were treated at a hospital and released.
   ``All's well that ends well, so to speak,'' Orlando said.
   There was no immediate from Mrs. Ellis; she did not return a
message left on the answering machine at her home in the Boston
suburb.

<TEXT>
   Egypt was officially welcomed back to
the Arab fold, after an absence of 10 years, as the Arab League
opened a ministerial meeting Sunday to prepare for a summit
conference.
   Moroccan Foreign Minister Abdel-Latif Filali, in the opening
address, said, ``We are all witnessing today an important
historical event demonstrated in the participation of the Arab
Republic of Egypt's delegation ... in our meetings after a long
absence.''
   Two seats for delegates from the 22-nation Arab League were
vacant at the conference hall.
   Libya is boycotting the session because it opposes Egypt's
return to the league, and there was no representative from Lebanon,
where there are rival Christian and Moslem governments.
   Egypt's membership was suspended after former President Anwar
Sadat signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
   ``I am certain that Egypt's return to the Arab League and the
resumption of its full membership in our organization will
contribute to joint Arab action and the strengthening of Arab
solidarity,'' Filali said.
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismat Abdel-Meguid said in response:
``Egypt is pleased to resume its membership and the historical and
important responsibilities that entails.
   ``It also stresses it shall fulfill its duties in accordance
with the Arab League charter.''
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is expected to attend the
summit conference that opens Tuesday.
   The ministerial meeting began at 7 p.m. after several delays
because of a six-member committee discussion of the situation in
Lebanon, where Christian militias have been waging artillery duels
with Syrian army units and their Druse allies.
   The committee did not submit a report but agreed to recommend to
the Arab leaders that both of Lebanon's declared prime ministers,
Christian Michel Aoun and Moslem Salim Hoss, be invited to the
summit.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, ``voiced reservations''
about the proposal to invite Gen. Aoun who has vowed to dislodge
Syrian forces from Lebanon, according to conference sources who
spoke with the condition they not be identified.
   Lebanon and the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip will be two of the main topics at the
summit.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization is expected to complain
that it has not received the aid promised at the last Arab summit
in Algeria in June 1988.
   PLO officials say league members promised to give the

monthly allocations.

   Air Force crews responding to the collapse
of an MX missile in an underground silo last summer were concerned
that the rocket could have accidentally ignited, according to a
report published Sunday.
   Ignition inside silo Q-10 at F.E. Warren Air Force Base could
have strewn highly radioactive plutonium around the site near
Guernsey, the Casper Star-Tribune said in a report based on the Air
Force's final accident report, which the newspaper obtained through
a Freedom of Information request.
   Lt. Col. Charles R. Banta was quoted in the accident report as
saying work crews worried that the rocket's solid fuel might have
been cracked by the collapse.
   ``If you have cracked propellant and you start moving it, you
can get friction within the crack and there was concern that it
could cause ignition,'' he said.
   ``It (the missile's condition) was an unknown. We were operating
under the (rocket maker Morton) Thiokol premise that said it was
relatively stable; if you don't move too fast and don't put a lot
of energy into the system, nothing will happen,'' said Banta.
   Air Force officials declined comment when contacted by the
newspaper, saying the report spoke for itself.
   The missile, capable of delivering 10 nuclear warheads, slid
roughly 6 inches down in its silo sometime between last June 12 and
June 15 when part of the rocket's aft skirt collapsed.
   During the incident the missile gave a ``missile away'' signal,
but Air Force officials in their initial report attributed that to
the rocket's umbilical cord breaking away when the weapon settled
to the base of its silo.
   The Washington Post reported in January that the accident led
the Air Force to take the heavy warheads off that missile and four
others from the same production batch that had a common problem.
The newspaper said the action ws taken to relieve weight on the
missile until the problem could be solved.
   Investigation determined that the collapsed missile's fuel did
not crack. In addition, the severing of the umbilical cord meant
there was no direct electrical connection and a grounding system to
protect the missile from static electricity was intact, the
newspaper said.
   The Air Force placed odds of an accidental ignition at less than
one chance in 10 million.
   An outside military authority, retired Navy Capt. James T. Bush,
told the Star-Tribune the ignition danger was much higher, but
admitted he had no involvement with the MX missile. He is associate
director of the Center for Defense Information in Washington.
   Bush said the greatest danger of an accidental ignition of the
solid rocket fuel is the heat it would create inside the sealed
silo.
   ``This fire would cook off or explode the HE (high explosive)
component of the warhead,'' he said. ``You then have a high
explosive yield which would possibly blow open the missile hatch
and distribute radioactive material for some unknown distance. That
would be very bad.''

<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three West Germans working for the
ASME-Humanitas relief organization left Lebanon Sunday, six days
after two colleagues were reported kidnapped in this southern port
city.
   A police spokesman said the three boarded the Lebanese cargo
ship Libra in Sidon and it departed for Cyprus at 5 p.m.
   Markus Quint, 21, who was reported abducted May 4 and returned
safely to the group on May 14, was one of the three. The others
were not identified.
   Quint was reported kidnapped with Petra Schnitzler, a nurse, and
Heinrich Struebig, an administrator. Ms. Schnitzler and Struebig
were released in a few hours but Quint was held until May 14.
   On May 16, Ms. Schnitzler, Struebig and Thomas Kemptner, 28,
were seized by gunmen in Sidon.
   Ms. Schnitzler was freed a few hours later by local militiamen
looking for thieves who stopped the abductors' car.
   Struebig and Kemptner are still missing. There have been no
claims of responsibility for the reported kidnappings, and Quint
and Ms. Schnitzler have refused to identify their abductors or
provide other details.
   Ms. Schnitzler, 26, told reporters she would stay in Lebanon
until Struebig and Kemptner were freed. Another woman working for
ASME-Humanitas also remained in Lebanon.
   The Germans have been staying since Thursday in two bases their
organization maintains in Zahrani and Aaqbiyeh, six miles south of
Sidon and controlled by the Shiite Amal militia.
   The Germans were expelled on Thursday from their main base at
the Mieh Mieh Palestinian refugee camp by the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which accused them of concealing the identities of
those involved in the kidnappings and of ignoring security
regulations.
   At least 15 other foreigners are being held hostage in Lebanon,
including nine Americans. Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   In addition an elderly Briton, Jack Mann, disappeared on May 12
in Beirut, and it is believed he was kidnapped.

   The army said Sunday it detained hundreds of
Moslem militants in the Gaza Strip in the largest such sweep since
the Arab uprising began. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir threatened
to resign if his party does not back his peace plan.
   In continued violence in the occupied territories, Israeli
soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians and wounded at least 25
in clashes.
   The Cabinet debated proposals to seal off the West Bank and
Gaza, a day after PLO-led activists of the 17-month uprising vowed
in a leaflet to kill an Israeli soldier or settler to avenge every
Palestinian killed by Israeli troops.
   Mohammed Abbas, a leading PLO guerrilla chief, called for the
use of firearms in an interview with the Kuwaiti daily Al Watan
published Sunday.
   ``I see that the time has now come to use arms in support of the
intefadeh,'' Arabic for uprising, he was quoted as saying.
   Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, has been branded a terrorist in
the United States because of his involvement in the 1985 hijacking
of the Italian passenger ship Achille Lauro in which an American,
Leon Klinghoffer, was killed.
   ``If a Palestinian is killed, we shall kill a soldier,'' said
slogans painted in the West Bank town of Nablus by the Palestinian
Popular Army, which describes itself as a paramilitary branch of
the uprising's underground leadership.
   Shamir said such calls were nothing new.
   ``I don't know the difference between intefadeh and terror,'' he
said on Israel radio. ``We know that terror organizations are very
active in all stages of the intefadeh.''
   The army on Sunday lifted a six-day curfew confining 700,000
people to their homes in Gaza, but few Gazans returned to jobs in
Israel because of a strike ordered by the uprising leadership.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, head of the army's central command,
said the curfew was used to detain 250 suspected activists of
Hamas, a Moslem fundamentalist movement. One of those arrested was
the movement's spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.
   Those arrested are suspected of carrying out attacks on Israeli
troops and Arabs alleged to have collaborated with Israel,
including shootings, bombings and firebomb attacks. They also are
accused of organizing and enforcing anti-Israeli protests, the army
said.
   Army officials described the sweep as the largest since the
December 1987 start of the Palestinian revolt.
   Hamas, Arabic for ``zeal,'' is considered the strongest movement
in Gaza. It advocates an Islamic state in the occupied lands and
Israel, putting it at odds with the PLO, which publicly demands
only a secular Palestinian state in the occupied lands.
   Sunday's casualties brought to at least 496 the number of
Palestinians killed in the uprising, which began in December 1987.
Twenty-two Israelis have died.
   In the Gaza Strip's Nuseirat refugee camp, troops killed Essam
Mohammed Aqel, 17, Arab hospital officials said. At least 17
Palestinians were wounded in stone-throwing confrontations with
soldiers in Gaza, Arab doctors said.
   In the West Bank, eight Arabs were wounded in clashes in four
villages. In Abu Dis near Jerusalem, soldiers dispersing a protest
by hundreds of young Palestinians killed Haitham Abu Arakat, 18,
said officials at Jerusalem's Muqassed hospital.
   The army confirmed only one wounded and the death in Abu Dis.
   Shamir threatened to step down if his right-wing Likud bloc
votes against his peace plan, which calls for Palestinians in the
occupied lands to elect Palestinian representatives to negotiate
with Israel on a period of self-rule. Talks would follow later on
the final status of the territories.
   ``I will not be able to continue in my position if I do not feel
that the movement I represent in the government supports me and
stands by my side,'' he said.
   Likud's central committee is due to vote on the subject in June,
and Shamir's two key rivals, Trade Minister Ariel Sharon and
Housing Minister David Levy, have threatened to join ranks and
defeat the plan.
   Shamir left Sunday for a two-day visit to London for talks with
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

   Ferdinand Marcos remained in very critical
condition Sunday, and his doctors said the former Philippines
president was alert and responding to medication.
   Marcos, 71, is undergoing kidney dialysis, has a respirator to
help him breath and is hooked up to a monitoring system, said
Eugene Tiwanak, assistant adminstrator of St. Francis Medical
Center.
   Marcos is alert and conscious and seems to be responding to
medication to fight a bacterial infection, said Tiwanak, who
stressed this didn't mean there has been any improvement in Marcos'
condition.
   ``His condition is episodic _ up and down. He's still in the
upswing mode,'' Tiwanak said at what was to be the only scheduled
medical briefing Sunday.
   On Saturday, Marcos was more alert and was able to communicate
with doctors through hand signals, Tiwanak said.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, meanwhile, denounced statements attributed
to Marcos supporters during a rally in Manila on Saturday that
Americans would be killed if Marcos dies in exile.
   The statement might have been the work of radicals infiltrating
Marcos supporters and attempting to provoke a violent reaction to
Philippines President Corazon Aquino's announcement that Marcos
will not be allowed to return, even if he dies, Mrs. Marcos said.
   ``It was precisely to bring about a reconciliation and to avoid
a continuation of this division that, transcending my own pain and
hurt, I appealed to Madame Aquino to allow Marcos to return to die
in his homeland,'' she said.
   ``I don't want violence, and I'm afraid that the hard-line
statements of the madame (Aquino) have caused this emotional
reaction among some people,'' she said.
   The Philippine Supreme Court on Friday denied the Marcoses'
petition to force the government to allow their return.
   ``We are being kicked back and forth like a football, and the
United States is being made into the fall guy,'' Mrs. Marcos said.
   During a convention in Manila of a revived opposition party,
Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who played a key role in the revolt against
Marcos, said Sunday that Mrs. Aquino should display leadership by
allowing Marcos to return to die in his homeland.
   Enrile, who was named secretary-general of the Nationalista
Party, said ``there is no reason why he should be deprived of his
right to come home at this time of his life. He's so ill. How can
he destabilize the country?''

   A huge thunderstorm forced the Air
Force to postpone the launch of an advanced navigation satellite
for a second time Sunday night.
   The launch was rescheduled for Tuesday at 7:43 p.m. Officials
decided to stand down 48 hours because Monday's weather forecast
was not favorable and the launch team needed a rest period, said
Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force launch commentator.
   ``The weather is bad and getting worse,'' Rand said. ``There is
a thunderstorm, an anvil cloud and lightning within five miles of
the launch pad. The lightning requires a shutdown of the rocket
guidance computer.''
   As he spoke, a huge black cloud rolled over Cape Canaveral from
the northwest, rain poured down and lightning crackled over the
area.
   The postponement was announced 40 minutes before the planned
liftoff of the Delta 2 rocket at 7:51 p.m.
   The launch was first postponed Saturday night because of strong
winds above the launch pad. The countdown clock then stood at 4
minutes.
   The Delta 2 carries a $65 million Navstar satellite that will
enable military units such as ships, planes, submarines and tanks
to determine their location within 50 feet and in some cases to
within 10 feet anywhere around the globe.

<TEXT>
   More than 150 people have been killed in
fighting over land ownership and grazing areas in Sudan's western
Darfar region, Khartoum newspapers reported Sunday.
   The English-language Sudan Times said the fighting began Friday
when about 3,000 Arabs attacked members of the African Fur tribe in
the vicinity of Jabal Mara Mountain.
   Interior Minister Mubarak Fadil Mahdi went to the region Sunday
to try to stop the fighting. The Information Ministry declined
comment on the newspaper accounts, saying a report would be issued
when it received information from Mahdi.
   There was no indication the Darfar fighting is linked to the
civil war in southern Sudan that has claimed thousands of lives
since 1983. Most of the rebels in the south are Christians or
animists who want greater automony from the predominantly
Arab-Moslem government in Khartoum.
   A train carrying 1,500 tons of food and other relief supplies
was en route Sunday to southern Sudan as part of a project to avoid
a repeat of last year's disaster, when up to 500,000 people died of
starvation and disease in villages isolated by the war.
   The train left Muglad in southwestern Sudan on Saturday for the
southern cities of Malwal, Maput and Aweil. Malwal and Maput are
controlled by the rebels' Sudan People's Liberation Army and the
government holds Aweil.
   Operation Lifeline Sudan is operating the relief project. It is
part of a U.N. effort to send 100,000 tons of food to southern
Sudan.
   U.N. officials say starvation threatens at least 100,000 people.

<HEAD>President Says NATO Must Not Drop Guard Against Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, facing disarmament pressure from
Europe, expressed concern Sunday about ``a growing complacency
throughout the West'' and said America and her allies must not drop
their guard against the Soviet Union.
   He said that in an era of ``extraordinary change'' in the Soviet
Union, ``We have an obligation to temper optimism _ and I am
optimistic _ with prudence.'' His comments came in remarks at
Boston University, where he shared commencement speaking duty with
French President Francois Mitterrand. Bush returned to Washington
on Sunday night.
   Pointing to Moscow's threat to retain some nuclear missiles
banned by a 1987 treaty if NATO upgrades its short-range arsenal,
Bush said, ``It is clear that Soviet `new thinking' has not yet
totally overcome the old.''
   Later, in a two-language joint news conference, Bush and
Mitterrand both expressed optimism that a rift within NATO over
short-range European missiles could be bridged before next week's
NATO summit.
   A spokesman for the West German government, Hans Klein, said
Bonn also is confident that a resolution can be reached before the
meeting. He said one proposal forms a basis for a solution but no
agreement has yet been reached.
   Bush said: ``I think we could well have this resolved before the
summit.''
   He said American officials have been in close touch with British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the missile issue, adding that
he agrees with her that ``we can get together on this vexing
question ...''
   ``My role has been behind the scenes, to be helpful in working
this problem ... to iron out those differences,'' Bush said.
   Mitterrand said NATO periodically faces internal controversies
such as the current one, adding he was hopeful this latest
difficulty would be resolved before the summit opens. ``I'd be
happy if the views can be reconciled,'' the French leader said.
   Mitterrand fielded one news conference question by dismissing a
comment from White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater that Soviet
Leader Mikhail Gorbachev was a ``drugstore cowboy'' whose arms
control proposals lack substance.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev is worth very much more than that,'' Mitterrand
said, dismissing ``caricatures.''
   As the words were translated, Bush laughed and said, ``So much
for Marlin.'' He added, ``I could defend Marlin'' _ but he neither
did that nor disavowed the spokesman's earlier remark.
   Mitterrand devoted his commencement address remarks largely to
the environment and said, ``The earth is our planet, so let us save
it.''
   The two leaders flew here together after a day of talks Saturday
at Bush's vacation estate overlooking the Atlantic Ocean on a rocky
point in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   They spoke before a commencement audience estimated at 31,000
people attending the ceremony at Nickerson Field football stadium.
In the hometown of Gov. Michael Dukakis, his defeated rival for the
White House, Bush got a standing ovation. But the cheers for
Dukakis, also on the stage, were louder.
   Bush's speech was designed to set the stage for the NATO summit
opening in Brussels on May 29. The 16-nation meeting has been
threatened by discord over short-range nuclear missiles in central
Europe.
   Over opposition from the United States and Britain, West Germany
has been leading a call for East-West negotiations to reduce the
weapons, and has been resisting plans to upgrade the missiles.
   The dispute has been aggravated by a series of disarmament
offers from Moscow that have put pressure on the West to take
similar steps.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell criticized Bush last
week, saying he was responding too timidly to arms proposals from
the Soviet Union.
   Praising French and British programs to upgrade their nuclear
weapons, Bush said, ``We do have a major concern. There's a growing
complacency throughout the West.''
   Underscoring his remark, he said there was ``a great irony'' in
that ``while an ideological earthquake is shaking asunder the very
communist foundation, the West is being tested by complacency.''
   ``We must never forget that twice in this century, American
blood has been shed over conflicts that began in Europe,'' Bush
said.
   Calling the Atlantic Alliance central to U.S. foreign policy,
Bush said, ``We must never forget that to keep the peace in Europe
is to keep the peace for America.''
   Without referring directly to the missile dispute, Bush said
nuclear weapons are an essential ingredient for the defense of
Europe.
   ``Our short-range deterrent forces based in Europe, and kept up
to date, demonstrate that America's vital interests are bound
inextricably to Western Europe and that an attacker can never
gamble on a test of strength with just our conventional forces,''
the president said.
   ``Though hope is now running high for a more peaceful continent,
the history of this century teaches Americans and Europeans to
remain prepared,'' Bush said.
   He said he was grateful for steps taken by Gorbachev, saying
``If the Soviets advance solid and constructive plans for peace,
then we should give credit where credit is due.
   ``We are seeing sweeping changes in the Soviet Union that show
promise of enduring, of becoming ingrained,'' Bush said.
   ``At the same time, in an era of extraordinary change, we have
an obligation to temper optimism _ and I am optimistic _ with
prudence.''
   Bush said, ``I believe in a step-by-step approach to East-West
relations because recurring signs show that while change in the
Soviet Union is dramatic, it is not yet complete.''
   He said the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact retains nearly a 12-to-1
advantage over the Atlantic Alliance in short-range missile and
rocket launchers and more than a 2-to-1 edge in battle tanks.
   On an economic front, Bush spoke warmly yet cautiously about
Western Europe's plans for a single common market free of internal
trade barriers by 1992.
   He said that despite apprehensions in some quarters about what a
united Europe will bring, ``this administration is of one mind. We
believe a strong, united Europe means a strong America.''
   ``...it is important to distinguish adversaries from allies and
allies from adversaries,'' Bush said. ``What a tragedy _ what an
absurdity _ it would be if future historians attribute the demise
of the Western Alliance to disputes over beef hormones and wars
over pasta.'' That was a reference to two trade areas that have
separated the United States and Europe.

   Two Texas state troopers who had stopped a
suspected drunken driver were killed early Sunday when a
tractor-trailer rig struck their patrol car, crushing the officers
between the two cars.
   The troopers, identified as Sgt. William Kuhnle, 36, and Trooper
Ralph Zerda, 29 died just before 3 a.m. on U.S. Highway 90, said
DPS spokesman Mike Cox.
   ``They had made a DWI traffic arrest and had requested routine
registration information, then had requested a wrecker,'' said Cox.
``But when one of the dispatchers called them back with the
registration information, they did not answer their radio.''
   The tractor-trailer rig, traveling westbound on U.S. 90, veered
off the road and struck the patrol car from behind. Kuhnle and
Zerda, both standing between their vehicle and the suspect's car,
were hit and died instantly, said Cox.
   The force of the impact threw Kuhnle's body about 500 feet. The
officers' car, which had been legally parked on the highway's
improved shoulder, was destroyed, he said.
   But the suspect, who had been placed in the car in a drunken
driving investigation, sustained only minor injuries. Cox said he
was treated and released from Wilford Hall Air Force Hospital for
cuts and bruises.
   Cox said no charges were filed against the suspect because ``the
only two witnesses who could place him behind the wheel were dead.''
   The truck driver, Ralph Walter Mueller, 51, of Tucumcari, N.M.,
was uninjured in the accident. He remains in Bexar County Jail,
charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter, Cox said.
   A blood sample taken from Mueller was scheduled to be analyzed
for alcohol content.
   Kuhnle and Zerda, both stationed in Bexar County, became the
64th and 65th troopers killed in the line of duty since the Texas
highway patrol began in 1930, Cox said.

<HEAD>Florida's Pension Fun May Have Role in Eastern Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez may try to use
Florida's $17 billion pension fund to back the purchase of Eastern
Airlines in an effort to protect jobs provided by the Miami-based
airline, according to reports Sunday.
   Two newspapers, The Miami Herald and the Palm Beach Post,
reported that an investment of at least $50 million was being
considered, given the proper guarantees against loss.
   Two high-ranking state aides were in New York Friday for talks
with officials of Eastern Airlines' pilot union and financial and
legal consultants.
   One of them, Brian Ballard, Martinez' chief of operations,
confirmed the negotiations.
   Martinez ``is extremely interested in protecting Floridians'
jobs'' and wants to keep Eastern in one piece and in Florida, ``but
we'll do nothing that wouldn't be an outstanding investment for
(Florida's) pension holders.''
   The loan was proposed by the Air Line Pilots Association, whose
support of striking Machinists has kept the Miami-based airline
virtually grounded since March 4.
   ``We propose to to give them a very secure investment for the
pension plan, and get Eastern back,'' said Randolph Babbitt,
executive administrator of ALPA.
   At the time the strike began, Eastern employed about 30,000
workers, 12,000 of them in Florida.
   The unions were seeking the financial help as part of
negotiations between the airline unions and two potential buyers:
Chicago commodities trader Joseph Ritchie and former Piedmont
Aviation Inc. President William Howard.
   An Eastern spokesman scoffed at the investment idea Saturday.
   ``The Ritchie and Howard proposals can best be described as
humpty-dumpty,'' Robin Matell said. ``Neither one is economically
realistic. If the state chooses to invest its money that way, it
will probably be the fastest method on record to find out whether
pensioners can survive on Social Security checks alone.''
   Details of the offers from Ritchie and Howard have been
unavailable, but both reportedly call for $210 million in wage
concessions in each of the next five years in exchange for partial
ownership.
   A representative of Howard's investor group said its bid
included $725 million in new capital, although only a small part
would be cash.
   To complete the deal and satisfy a federal bankruptcy judge in
New York who must approve the sale, the unions would need to raise
at least $50 million more, Babbitt said. Searching for the balance,
union officials approached the state and other pension funds,
Babbitt said.
   To guarantee the state money, the unions would agree to place 1
percent of the airline's labor payroll in an escrow account as
insurance that the state would receive a return on the investment.
   ``Labor can guarantee that money if for any reason the company
was unable to pay dividends for the state's investment,'' Babbitt
said.
   Cliff Hinkle, executive director of the state Board of
Administration who traveled to New York with Ballard, refused to
discuss specifics, but noted that ``we look at investment
possibilities every day.''
   Florida's pension fund is one of the healthiest in the nation,
containing about $17 billion in a diverse portfolio of common
stocks, bonds and real estate. It is the 12th largest in the United
States and 25th largest in the world, Hinkle said.
   As governor, Martinez sits at the head of the state's
three-member Board of Administration, which oversees state
investments.
   Eastern has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since
March 9. Any sale must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
Lifland, who on Monday will receive a report on the offers by
Howard and Ritchie and consider developer Donald Trump's offer to
buy the airlines' shuttle service between Boston, New York and
Washington.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent company Texas Air
Corp., has proposed selling $1.8 billion in assets to restructure
the airline into a smaller operation.
   In addition to Trump's $365 million offer for the shuttle,
Phoenix-based America West Airlines has made a $751-million bid for
the shuttle and 15 Boeing 757s. USAir has offered $525 million for
15 Boeing 757s, maintenance hangers and airport landing slots in 10
cities.

<HEAD>Year's Third Endangered Condor Chick Coaxed From Egg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California condor chick was coaxed from its
egg Sunday as keepers clucked over the year's third successful
hatching in an ongoing effort to save the giant vulture from
extinction.
   The chick, named Kaduku, was the first conceived by a pair of
6-year-old birds at the Los Angeles Zoo, changing biologists'
notions about when condors reach sexual maturity, said San Diego
Wild Animal Park spokesman Tom Hanscom.
   ``It previously was not known if California condors achieved
full sexual maturity at age 6 or 7,'' Hanscom said. ``It was
thought to be 7 but these birds proved us wrong.''
   The sparsely feathered bird, hatched from a pale aqua-colored
egg laid on Easter Sunday, weighed 5.8 ounces after it was helped
from the shell by handlers at the San Diego park around 11:20 a.m.,
Hanscom said.
   ``It was our Easter egg,'' said Los Angeles Zoo spokeswoman
Cindy Richardson. ``It looks really healthy and is doing great.''
   The baby, whose Konkow Indian name means ``very strong being,
both physically and spiritually,'' joined two other chicks at the
park's so-called ``condorminium'' and was scheduled to take its
first meal of minced mouse meat Sunday night.
   The baby bird, conceived by a pair of birds named Cayuma and
Cachuma, was the fourth captive-bred condor chick successfully
hatched, bringing the world's California condor population to 31.
   All remaining wild condors, which are North America's largest
land birds, have been captured in hopes of building their numbers
in captivity.
   Seventeen condors are housed at the animal park in northern San
Diego County, about 30 miles northeast of downtown San Diego, and
the other 14 live at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   Sunday's hatching followed one on Thursday and the year's first
on April 19. The first captive-bred chick, named Molloko, hatched
in 1988 and remains in good health as do the other chicks.
   Like all previous captive condor chicks, Kaduku was brought to
the ``condormimium'' in San Diego as soon as the egg was laid in
hopes the parents would produce another egg to replace it.
   The female Cachuma previously produced another egg, but it was
infertile.
   Los Angeles Zoo officials have been encouraged by the pair's
continued affectionate behavior, saying they hoped the birds would
become productive members of the breeding program.
   The chicks are raised by handlers who use lifelike
condor-replica puppets to feed the birds, allowing for close
scrutiny of their daily progress by while maintaining the chicks'
identification with their own kind.
   The captive-breeding program was established when numbers of the
black carrion-eaters dwindled because of shooting and pesticide
contamination.

   Thousands of native Chinese marched together in Hong Kong,
Paris, Tokyo and scores of other cities Sunday in a worldwide show
of solidarity with their besieged brethren in Beijing.
   President Bush likened the protests in China to the civil rights
marches led by Martin Luther King, and the Nationalist Chinese
government in Taiwan condemned the actions of the rival communist
regime on the mainland.
   The demonstrations came as hundreds of thousands of people in
Beijing defied martial law for a second day in a row and swarmed
through the city demanding democratic reforms. The army was
reportedly poised for a crackdown.
   In Hong Kong, a British colony scheduled to revert to Chinese
rule in 1997, an estimated 400,000 people virtually paralyzed the
city during a peaceful march in support of the Beijing protesters.
   Media were generally supportive. Even the staff of the Xinhua
News Agency, the unofficial representative of China in Hong Kong,
wrote a banner to support the marchers.
   The crowd marched for three hours, then entered a race track and
listened to speeches by community leaders, movie stars and
lawmakers.
   In the United States, Chinese students said in an open telegram
that they no longer recognize the government led by Premier Li Peng.
   ``We 10,000 Chinese students in New York City and the East Coast
of the United States are on the side of the Chinese people,'' the
telegram said.
   ``We no longer recognize the Chinese government led by Li Peng
as a legal administration in China, and we pledge our complete
disobedience to such a hostile government towards the whole Chinese
nation.''
   About 300 students attended a demonstration at the Chinese
consulate in New York. Three students met with officials of the
Chinese consulate in New York and delivered the telegram.
   Other rallies were held in Lawrence, Kan; Houston and Washington
D.C.
   Taiwan's Nationalist government condemned the communist Chinese
government for ordering military troops to crack down on the
student-led protests. It said it may take ``effective measures'' to
support the pro-democracy movement.
   Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming refused to say what that might
include, because ``we don't want to offer the mainland any excuse
to take retaliatory action against the students.''
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan in 1949 when they lost a
civil war in China, continue to claim they are the legitimate
government of all China. The Nationalists and Communist Chinese are
technically still at war.
   About 100 Taiwanese demonstrated in the capital, Taipei, to
support the Chinese protesters.
   In Tokyo, thousands of Chinese studying in Japan rallied and
marched downtown.
   Spokesman Yang Zhao said 4,500 people joined in the gathering
organized by the Solidarity Union of Chinese Students in Japan.
Police estimated the number at 2,000.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. said Chinese students also marched
in Osaka, Nagoya, Tsukuba and other cities.
   About 1,000 Chinese students demonstrated Sunday in Paris,
carrying banners in French and Chinese with slogans such as
``Brothers and sisters we love you, old dictators we hate you,''
and ``1789 Liberty for the French, 1989 Democracy for the Chinese;
Bastille Equals Tiananmen.''
   France is celebrating the bicentennial of its revolution this
year, with festivities climaxing on July 14, the anniversary of the
storming of the Bastille prison.
   Bush called on Chinese authorities Sunday to show restraint in
dealing with the pro-democracy demonstrations, urging officials to
be ``as forthcoming as possible in order to see more
democratization, and to see a peaceful resolution.''
   ``I do not want to see bloodshed,'' he told reporters. ``We
revere the model of Martin Luther King in this country for his
peaceful protest,'' Bush said.
   The remarks were his first detailed comments on the situation.

   A group of vengeful men waving baseball bats
beat a police officer's 17-year-old son and left him dying with a
bullet in his back, police said Sunday.
   A 19-year-old man, Rafael Droz of Philadelphia, was charged with
murder Sunday and police were searching for up to a dozen more
suspects, said homicide Lt. James Henwood.
   The attackers piled out of three cars Saturday night in North
Philadelphia and went after Sean Dailey and a group of nine to 15
of his friends, Sgt. Dennis Murray said.
   The others escaped, but Dailey was caught on a street corner,
beaten to the ground and shot in the back, Murray said. Dailey died
several hours later at Episcopal Hospital.
   The attack was apparently in retaliation for a fight between one
of the attackers and a man in the neighborhood a week ago, Henwood
said. He said Dailey was not involved in the fight.
   ``He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Henwood
said.

   When actor Martin Sheen took over as
honorary mayor of this celebrity enclave, he shook up some of his
neighbors by declaring the beach community a nuclear-free haven for
the homeless and aliens.
   On Sunday, he had more to say.
   ``I regret that my concern for the poor and the environment was
so dishonestly misinterpreted and misused to perpetrate cruel hoax
on 4 million Americans who are already broken beyond any measure of
understanding,'' the actor said in a statement issued through
spokesman Bill Greenblatt.
   The declaration by Sheen, who succeeded actress Ali MacGraw as
honorary mayor, was a bit ill-received last week.
   Johnny Carson poked fun at Sheen's remarks in his monologue on
NBC's ``Tonight Show,'' and the marquee at the Malibu Inn and
restaurant briefly read ``Dump Martin Sheen.'' The bar manager
later decided the message should come down.
   One business leader complained ``Malibu is a laughingstock.''
   ``I am deeply troubled and profoundly saddened by certain
irresponsible media personalities who have abused their power to
gain ratings by treading on misery and suffering,'' Sheen responded.

<HEAD>Ballet Theater Presents Three New Tharp Ballets</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Choreographer Twyla Tharp, artistic associate of
American Ballet Theater, has some new ballets for the company this
season.
   Instead of slipping them into the repertoire one a week, as
might be expected, the company premiered three with a flourish on
the same night, Saturday, at the Metropolitan Opera House.
   The first, ``Everlast,'' is set in 1919 and tells a story, like
a charming movie of the Keystone Kops era, of a girl, danced by
Susan Jaffe, whose mother decides to marry her off to a boxing
champ, danced by Kevin O'Day, for his money. The girl prefers
dancing with the boys in the chorus.
   A waitress, Anne Adair, falls for the champ and dresses like a
boy to get hired to work with his trainer. A couple of old
busybodies, danced by Shelley Washington and Kathleen Moore,
provide comic relief in an already light-hearted dance. They scoot
in with potted trees in front of them, to spy on the oh-you-kid
goings on and report to the mother, danced by Georgina Parkinson.
   The music is 16 songs by Jerome Kern, chosen for lyrics that
tell the story. Judy Blazer, Jason Graae and Molly Wasserman sang
them, on stage with Michael Dansicker at an upright piano.
   ``Everlast,'' at 40 minutes, is shorter than Fred Astaire movie
musicals because the plot is told by, instead of interrupted by,
the songs and dancing. There is real dancing in ``Everlast,'' as a
solo to ``Left All Alone Again Blues.''
   We very much admire ``Quartet,'' the second New York premiere,
which uses four dancers and a recording by the Kronos Quartet of
Terry Riley music. It's in the tradition of modern-looking,
plotless ballets to modern music like ``Episodes,'' which George
Balanchine choreographed to Webern.
   Alessandra Ferri, Ricardo Bustamente, Susan Jaffe and Jeremy
Collins looked good, often dancing in unison, sometimes one
couple's dancing echoing what the other had just done. Wearing
crisp white shirts and black shorts, they moved constantly but
never seemed frenetic.
   Miss Tharp is known for novelty and ``Bum's Rush,'' which we
liked least of the three, is a novelty ballet, set on a vaudeville
stage. Stagehands dance, so does a baggy-pants comedian. A truck
tire with shapely legs and toe shoes sticking down from it walks
around, gets between a ballerina and her partner or amusingly
collapses on itself.
   Dick Hyman composed music for the half-hour romp. Our favorite
part of it was jazz dancing by two men and our least favorite part
slapstick by three men making animal noises.
   The three dances were premiered earlier this year in San
Francisco, Miami Beach and Chicago, respectively. The evening ended
with an older Twyla Tharp dance, ``In the Upper Room.''

   Doctors removed nearly a half-pound of
razor blades, paper clips and metal bedsprings from the stomach of
a prison inmate who swallowed the metal in a suicide attempt.
   Surgeons operated on Carl Rhoades, 32, on Friday, a prison
official said. Rhoades swallowed the metal on March 13.
   The 7{ ounces of metal was thought to have caused a gastric
ulcer but no other damage, said Les Harmon, associate director of
the Kansas State Industrial Reformatory in Hutchinson.
   Rhoades initially refused surgery so prison officials got a
court order allowing them to authorize it. He eventually signed the
consent form.
   The prisoner was recovering at a Hutchinson hospital. The
nursing supervisor at the hospital said Sunday she could release no
information about his condition.
   Rhoades was convicted of aggravated battery last year for
shooting a motorist during an argument. He was sentenced to 10 to
20 years in prison.

   Students occupied Tiananmen Square in violation
of martial law for a third day Monday as a reported ultimatum by
Premier Li Peng passed. Hundreds of thousands of people filled the
streets to defend the students from a feared military crackdown.
   City residents surrounded troop convoys with thousands of people
and blocked major roads with public buses, trucks and garbage cans.
Protesters drove buses up to subway entrances on the square to
block any emerging troops.
   Supporters also formed a human cordon around the protesters at
Tiananmen, while motorcyclists and bicyclists signaled their
support by circling the square in a noisy procession.
   The Beijing citizens, angered by Li's hard-line stance, vowed
defiantly to continue their support until the premier resigns. Many
also demanded the resignation of senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
believing Li acted on Deng's orders.
   ``Li and Deng are stopping China from advancing,'' said a worker
from a machine factory. ``They should step down and let China
become a powerful country.''
   As the political situation became increasingly murky, rumors
swirled around the city. One unconfirmed report broadcast by
students in Tiananmen claimed Deng and Li had resigned.
   At the vast square, students sang the ``Internationale'' and the
Chinese national anthem as the reported 5 a.m. Monday (4 p.m. EDT
Sunday) deadline for leaving the square went by without incident.
   ``We will not retreat from the square,'' student leader Wang Dan
said over a loudspeaker. He led the 200,000 students and supporters
in a pledge: ``We won't give up until we reach our goals.''
   There were no reports of movement by soldiers who on Saturday
occupied major state-run news organizations and sealed off some
roads leading into the capital.
   Chinese sources said 1,500 soldiers armed with automatic weapons
had moved into the train station about a mile east of the square,
but the troops did not appear during the night.
   The independent student union that has led the protests
announced it received a message from Li saying the military would
clear Tiananmen by force by 5 a.m.
   The student loudspeaker announced that the union had rejected
Li's ultimatum and called on the protesters to remain calm and
restrained.
   Beijing Radio and national television denied an ultimatum had
been given and read a statement that the troops' goal was to
restore order, not suppress the students. But it was clear order
could not be restored without ending the occupation of Tiananmen,
the focus of five weeks of pro-democracy protests.
   The students are demanding a nationally televised dialogue with
the government, recognition of their independent student unions and
government measures to ensure freedom of the press and an end to
official corruption.
   Li called in the 27th and 28th armies Friday night and declared
martial law in central Beijing on Saturday. However, his inability
to enforce martial law made it clear an intense political struggle
was going on behind the scenes.
   The status of relatively liberal Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang, said by Chinese sources to have resigned in
protest, remained unclear. There was no official statement.
   The exact number of soldiers called in was not immediately known.
   A Chinese source said 60,000 to 70,000 soldiers moved into the
city center by subway and followed connecting tunnels to the walled
palace, the history museum and the Great Hall of the People on
three sides of Tiananmen. The subway was closed to regular traffic
most Sunday.
   The People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, the Central Radio
Station and the Central Television Station also were occupied by
troops, a People's Daily reporter said. Only the English-language
China Daily's weekly business edition was delivered Sunday.
   Beijing television reported soldiers will be sent to major
universities, which have been the center of the pro-democracy
protests, to ``keep order.''
   Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa, in a televised speech, said more than
200 buses and trolleys were being used as roadblocks around the
city. He said city supplies of coal and liquified gas were running
low and that the roadblocks hindered the transport of milk, eggs
and other staples.
   Crowds surrounding troop trucks gave the soldiers cigarettes,
food and water.
   Tens of thousands marched Sunday in Shanghai, a Western resident
reported. Several hundred marched in the coastal city of Tianjin, a
reporter there said.
   In Hong Kong, a British colony that will come under Chinese rule
in 1999, about 400,000 people marched peacefully to support the
pro-democratic movement.
   In Tokyo, thousands of Chinese studying in Japan marched
downtown to protest the declaration of martial law in Beijing.
   The standoff in the square began May 13 when students began a
hunger strike. The hunger strike was called off Saturday, but the
protest has grown to include Chinese from all walks of life.
   Under martial law, foreign reporters were told they could not
conduct interviews, take pictures or make tapes or videos at many
locations.
   The government also banned marches, strikes, class boycotts,
distributing pamphlets, speech-making, spreading rumors and any
attacks on leaders.

   Up to 40,000 anti-abortion demonstrators turned
out for a peaceful rally in downtown St. Louis on Sunday, police
said.
   Lt. Roy Miller said the demonstrators, who rallied at Kiener
Plaza after marching several blocks, gathered without incident and
no arrests were made.
   ``There were no physical confrontations,'' Miller said. ``Their
adversaries were giving a few catcalls and such but that's about
it.''
   Organizers called it the largest anti-abortion rally ever in St.
Louis. Miller said the crowd was estimated at 40,000, but several
police officers at the scene, as well as pro-choice supporters,
disagreed. They said only about 5,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were
on hand.
   The ``Show-Me Life'' rally came several weeks after the U.S.
Supreme Court heard arguments in a Missouri abortion case which
could be used to overturn the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision that
legalized the procedure in 1973.
   The court is expected to announce its decision this summer in
the case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services.
   The Missouri law at issue, passed in 1986, declares that human
life begins at conception. It restricts abortion by banning the
procedure in publicly funded hospitals and by forbidding the use of
public funds.
   Loretto Wagner of Missouri Citizens for Life said rally
organizers hoped to impress the Supreme Court with the number of
people who attended.
   ``This is a Missouri rally of proud Missourians hoping and
praying that the Missouri case will bring down the curtain on this
sad era in our country's history,'' she said.
   Among those addressing the crowd was Janet Ashcroft, the wife of
Republican Gov. John Ashcroft, and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
Danforth said that if Roe vs. Wade was overturned, the power to
dictate abortion law would return to the state legislatures, and
ultimately to the voters.
   The rally was sponsored by Missouri Citizens for Life, along
with the Archdiocesan Pro-Life Committee, the Christian Action
Council and Clergy for Life.

   Fourteen people, including a

Manila neighborhood early Monday, police said.
   Lt. Honorato Manuel, chief of the Manila police arson division,
said the fire began in the stairs of an old two-story wooden house
in the Santa Ana district, where four families were renting rooms.
   Two of the families escaped through the back stairs but the
others were trapped in their rooms, which had iron bars in the

70-year-old man, he added.
   ``Witnesses said the victims were waving and calling for help,
but neighbors could not go near because it was already very hot and
they did not know how to save the people trapped inside,'' Manuel
said.
   The fire lasted for 45 minutes and razed 10 houses, Manuel said.

   Former President Reagan said Sunday the House of
Representatives has become almost a permanent chamber with ``less
turnover than the Supreme Soviet,'' and called for fairness in
congressional redistricting.
   Reagan urged state governments to set up bipartisan citizen
commissions to redraw boundaries after the 1990 national census.
   ``I think it will be a big issue in the 1990s and I intend to be
in the thick of it,'' Reagan said in a 20-minute speech to more
than 4,000 people attending the National Restaurant Association's
70th Restaurant and Hotel-Motel Show.
   ``I am putting the legislators on notice to keep it fair or they
may find the Gipper on the steps of their state capitols calling
attention to their shenanigans,'' he said, drawing laughter.
   Reagan also called for steps to balance the federal budget,
saying he was ``working to help future presidents ... get the tools
they need to bring the budget under control,'' including a
constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget and the
presidential power to veto a budget line by line.
   The Republican senior statesman said the House of
Representatives, which is dominated by Democrats, ``has become
virtually a permanent chamber.''
   ``It has less turnover than the Supreme Soviet,'' Reagan said,
adding that 98 percent of the incumbents who ran for re-election
last year won.
   He called gerrymandering _ the rigging of congressional
districts' boundaries to assure a majority vote to one party or
another _ an ``abuse of power that distorts democracy.''
   Reagan said Americans must ``be vigilant and protective of their
powers or those powers will be ceded to Washington.''
   ``Be strong and courageous ... go to the polls ... take an
interest in government, and let your representatives know how you
feel ... and what you want,'' he said.
   He reiterated his support for repealing the 22nd Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution, which limits a president to two terms.
   ``Since I'm already out to pasture this amendment doesn't affect
me, but I think it should be repealed,'' he said, labeling it
``another area where the people's democratic rights are being
thwarted.''
   After his speech, Reagan stayed on stage for 40 minutes to
answer questions from the audience, sign autographs and shake hands.
   Asked what he was doing with his spare time, he noted that he
had made a number of speeches in the four months since he left the
presidency.
   ``I'm looking for my spare time,'' the former president joked.
``I'm enjoying it.''

<HEAD>Opposition Party Formed, Laurel At Head, Urges Marcos Return</HEAD>

   A revived opposition party urged
President Corazon Aquino Sunday to call new elections, and the
group's new secretary-general said the president should allow
Ferdinand Marcos to return as a sign of her leadership.
   The call came at the end of a one-day convention of the
Nationalista Party. The 4,000 delegates agreed to revive the party
as the major opposition movement against Mrs. Aquino.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel was named party president, Sen.
Juan Ponce Enrile was designated secretary-general and Blas Ople, a
labor minister under Marcos, was chosen executive vice president,
both by acclamation.
   Laurel quit as foreign secretary on September 1987 and refused
to serve in the Cabinet, claiming ``fundamental differences'' with
Mrs. Aquino. Laurel remains as vice president, which is an elective
post.
   During the convention, Enrile, a former defense minister, said
Mrs. Aquino should display leadership by allowing Marcos to return
from Hawaii to die in his homeland.
   ``We believe that Marcos should be allowed to come back,''
Enrile said. ``There is no reason why he should be deprived of his
right to come home at this time of his life. He's so ill. How can
he destabilize the country?''
   The former president was reported in critical condition Sunday
in a Honolulu hospital after undergoing emergency kidney surgery.
Hospital officials said his prognosis is poor, although he showed
signs of responding to treatment.
   On Friday, Mrs. Aquino refused to allow Marcos to return and
said her government would not allow him to buried in the
Philippines. Marcos has lived in Hawaii since he was ousted in a
popular uprising in February 1986 that propelled Mrs. Aquino to
power.
   Mrs. Aquino has cited national security for refusing previous
bids by Marcos to come home.
   ``If Mrs. Aquino feels she is the leader of the country, then
she should show that she is, by controlling the situation where her
worst perceived enemy is inside the country, not when he is outside
and dying,'' Enrile said.
   Enrile played a key role in a military revolt against Marcos,
which triggered the ``people power'' uprising that toppled the
former president. Mrs. Aquino retained Enrile as defense chief but
fired him in November 1986 after a coup attempt by his followers.
   Sunday's convention was the latest attempt to put together a
unified, viable opposition to Mrs. Aquino.
   Previous attempts to build an opposition party have foundered
because of personal rivalries and the fact that many leading
figures are tainted by their previous links to Marcos.
   The Nacionalistas, who suspended activities when Marcos declared
eight years of martial rule in 1972, hope to win the presidency in
1992, when Mrs. Aquino's term expires. She has said she will not
seek re-election.

<HEAD>Building Targeted for Demolition, But Won't Fall</HEAD>

   A high-rise building wracked by two
demolition blasts leaned precariously but did not fall Sunday,
prompting officials to evacuate nearby residents while wrecking
crews moved in with a crane.
   ``We've got one building leaning and one building leaning
against it,'' said police Major John Power. ``It's a hazardous
condition and I don't know what could happen.''
   A cloud of smoke rose from the bottom of the building around
8:30 a.m., but the 10-story tower remained standing. Patrolman John
Egan said demolition crews were not sure why the implosion did not
work.
   The demolition experts, who had used 500 pounds of dynamite in
the first implosion, fetched 36 pounds of more explosives and
staged a second effort. This time, part of the building tipped
slightly and leaned against another tower that may also face
demolition, but the structure remained standing.
   A ball and crane were at the scene, but officials said
demolition plans still had to be made. Stephen O'Rourke, head of
the city's housing authority, said it could take up to two weeks
for the wrecking crews to dismantle the listing building.
   Police had warned people to watch the second try from home on
their televisions after officers had problems with crowding at the
site.
   Three streets were partially cordoned off for the night. Power
said a few families living nearby would have to find somewhere else
to stay until the building was brought down. Residents without a
place to go would be accommodated, officials said.
   The two towers and one other are the subject of a federal
lawsuit filed by Project BASIC, a housing advocacy group, against
the Providence Housing Authority.
   U.S. District Judge Raymond Pettine allowed the tower to be
demolished after architects ruled that the building, when being
prepared for demolition, was made unsafe.
   But Pettine's April 21 temporary restraining order against
demolition still stands for the two other towers. Project BASIC
contends the buildings are structurally safe and should be
preserved because of the need for low-income housing.
   The housing authority had planned to build smaller residential
buildings at the site.

   A small U.S. plane used in Peru's anti-drug
effort crashed in the Andes mountains, killing the six Americans
and three Peruvians aboard, officials said Sunday.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles Loveridge said the plane went
down Saturday afternoon, after it had left the jungle town of Tingo
Maria. He said the wreckage was spotted Sunday morning.
   Loveridge refused to provide the names of the passengers. But he
said the dead Americans included a DEA agent, two helicopter
pilots, the plane's pilot, a mechanic and a security officer from
the embassy.
   In Washington, Maurice Hill, a DEA public information officer,
identified the dead DEA agent as Rick Finley, 36, of Ft. Knox, Ky.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Yovera said all nine on the
single-engine plane died. He said the three Peruvians were a police
captain, the 8-year-old son of a police commander and the chief of
the U.S.-funded coca eradication program.
   Yovera said the U.S. plane was flown by an American contract
pilot, and Hill said it was owned by the U.S. State Department's
International Narcotics Matters Bureau.
   Yovera said there was no indication of what had caused the
crash, but he discounted sabotage because of strict security
controls.
   American personnel in two Peruvian military helicopters from
Lima were recovering the bodies Sunday, Yovera said. The effort had
been suspended Sunday night until the morning, Loveridge said.
   Yovera said the plane crashed in a remote area on the arid
western slopes of the Andes, 65 miles northeast of Lima.
   Loveridge said rescue teams aboard helicopters had spotted the
plane's wreckage and burned bodies scattered nearby. He said the
plane was destroyed when it apparently slammed into a mountainside
15,000 feet above sea level and the largest piece visible from the
air was the engine.
   Loveridge said the last contact with the plane was when the
aircraft passed over Huanuco, 185 miles northeast of Lima.
   Tingo Maria is 240 miles northeast of the capital in the lush
Upper Huallaga river valley, a jungle-cloaked region on the eastern
slopes of the Andes.
   The valley is the world's greatest source of coca leaf, the raw
material for cocaine. The U.S. government has assigned several
dozen agents to work with Peruvian anti-drug police in campaigns
against drug traffickers in the violent region.
   In addition to the plane, the U.S. government has supplied nine
helicopters to Peru for the anti-drug fight and has contracted
private American pilots and technicians, many of them Vietnam War
veterans, to fly the aircraft.
   The Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group controls much of
the valley and works hand in hand with drug traffickers, police and
U.S. officials say.

<HEAD>Jury Votes Three Death Penalty Sentences for Former LA Cop</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jurors who convicted a former Los Angeles
policeman of murdering a Las Vegas socialite and two others decided
Sunday the death penalty should be imposed for each of the three
killings.
   The jury found Steven Homick, 48, guilty on May 12 in the
killing of oil heiress Bobbie Jean Tipton, her maid, Marie Bullock,
and deliveryman James Myers.
   The jury began deliberating Homick's fate on Thursday after
listening to two days of testimony in the penalty phase of the
trial and an appeal by prosecutors that he be put to death.
   Sunday afternoon, the jury ordered three death penalties, one
for each of the slayings. Formal sentencing was set for June 21 by
District Judge Myron Levitt.
   Homick, a Los Angeles police officer for 14 months in 1964 and
1965 who has steadfastly maintained his innocence, declared after
his conviction, ``My head and my heart are clear.''
   Prosecutor Mel Harmon said the Dec. 11, 1985, slayings occurred
when Homick went to Tipton's Las Vegas home to rob her of $1
million in jewelry he thought she had at the residence.
   Homick has also been charged in the so-called ``Ninja'' contract
slayings of a Los Angeles couple in September 1985 and with being
the leader of a ring that killed an elderly Las Vegas man the same
year.
   In the latter case, a federal indictment returned in March
accused Homick of running a criminal enterprise dealing in
murder-for-hire, arson, narcotics trafficking and other crimes.
   Ten others were also charged, including two of Homick's brothers
and his wife.

   Two small airplanes collided in the air
along the New Hampshire-Vermont border Sunday, sending one hurtling
into a river and killing both people aboard. The other plane landed
safely on a highway.
   State police and eye witnesses said they were amazed that the
pilot of the second plane was able to land safely because his
windshield had been shattered by what appeared to be a tail piece
from the first plane.
   The pilot was identified as Zachary Clark of Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. He and his passenger, a woman whose name was not released,
were listed in fair condition Sunday night at the Dartmouth
Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover, N.H.
   The dead were reported to be from New Hampshire, although their
names were not released. The two were believed to have been flying
out of Lebanon, N.H.
   According to police and eyewitnesses, it appeared that Clark's
plane was headed south when the other plane crossed slightly above,
heading southeast, at about 1 p.m.
   ``According to the preliminary police report, the landing gear
on one struck the fuselage of the other,'' said Mike Ciccarelli, a
spokesman for the FAA in Boston.
   A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said it may
be six months before a formal report on the cause of the accident
is completed.
   The collision between the two Cessna 172s occurred as Vernon
Clark of Lebanon, N.H., was playing golf at the Bradford Golf Club.
   ``There was this crunch. And the young fellow playing with me
looked up at the noise and said, `My God, those two planes just
collided.' I looked up and saw one of the planes veer away to the
river and go into a spin. It seemed to take a long time to come
down.''
   The plane crashed into the Waits River, just west of its
convergence with the Connecticut River. Clark's plane managed to
come down on Interstate 91 a short distance away, police said.
   Greg Kemmis, a reporter for the Caledonian Record, saw the
second plane land as he was driving north on the highway.
   ``When I got there, the plane was parked in the breakdown lane
like it belonged there,'' Kemmis said. ``It looked natural _ except
there was a wing sticking in the right lane.''
   Kemmis said that when he got a closer look at the plane, he
noticed that the tail section of another plane had shattered the
cockpit window and was sticking out over the nose.
   Ciccarelli said neither plane was under FAA traffic control at
the time of the crash. Visibility was 10 miles with haze, he said.

<HEAD>Call for Political Rehabilitation of Executed Premier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SZEGED, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 400 delegates demanding reforms in
the ruling Communist Party called Sunday for the political
rehabilitation of Premier Imre Nagy, executed after the 1956
revolution.
   The two-day session, which ended Sunday, was the first national
conference of the reform movement. It followed a meeting in
Kecskemet on April 15 when Communist Party members urged major
changes in Hungary's political structure.
   In a final resolution, the delegates representing 110 working
groups from throughout Hungary said an official declaration should
be issued rehabilitating Nagy and state that he was the victim of a
``rigged political trial.''
   Conference delegates reviewed the 40 years of Communist rule
after World War II and declared:
   _A special congress of the Communist Party should be held next
fall, ahead of the session scheduled in 1990, ``to clear all
political issues as to where the party is going.''
   _Representatives to the congress should be elected at local
levels.
   _The party should reject ``democratic centralism'' _ the
principle that the minority should accept all decisions adopted by
the majority.
   _The Communist Party should change its name to Hungarian
Socialist Party, Democratic Socialist People's Party or the
Hungarian Reform Party ``to reflect its new, democratic character.''
   But the issue of the rehabilitation of Nagy, the premier when
the Soviets sent troops into Hungary to crush a revolt, was the
most emotional issue.
   The resolution said the rehabilitation should be declared before
the June 16 reburial of Nagy's remains.
   The burial ceremony is to be broadcast by state television but
the government has no plans to be officially represented.
   Nagy, who formed a coalition government in 1956 that tried to
break with the Soviet Union and Warsaw pact, and others convicted
of revolutionary activities were executed on June 16, 1958. Their
bodies were buried in unmarked graves.
   Earlier this year the government, under intense pressure, agreed
to reburial of the bodies and the funeral.
   A government commission is reviewing Nagy's trial.
   Imre Pozsgay, a reform member of the Communist Party's
Politburo, told a news conference Saturday the impatience of
reformers for a quick decision on Naby's rehabilitation was
justified. But he said he would wait until the public prosecutor
files a final report, expected sometime this fall.
   ``Execution for political reasons cannot be justified under any
circumstances,'' he said.

   President Bush expressed hope for world peace, French President
Francois Mitterrand stressed environmentalism and ex-baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth pushed volunteerism in commencement
speeches around the nation Sunday.
   Also speaking at college graduation ceremonies were U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, novelist E.L. Doctorow,
U.S. Environmental Protection Administration chief William K.
Reilly and Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   Boston University scored a commencement coup with speeches by
both Bush and Mitterrand, who appeared before 31,000 graduating
seniors, relatives and friends at Nickerson Field football stadium
under mostly sunny skies.
   Bush said he was optimistic about the prospects for continued
peace, particularly in Western Europe, but cautioned ``the history
of this century teaches Americans and Europeans to remain
prepared.''
   Bush, who faces pressure for further disarmament in Europe,
stressed NATO's importance and urged cooperative efforts to
preserve its strength.
   Mitterrand, who joined Bush on the dais, devoted his remarks
largely to the environment. ``The Earth is our planet, so let us
save it,'' he said.
   Bush received a standing ovation. But Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, his defeated rival for the presidency, drew louder
applause from the hometown audience when he was introduced on the
stage.
   Bush and Mitterrand received honorary doctor of laws degrees.
Bush's wife, Barbara, was awarded an honorary doctorate in humane
letters.
   At the University of Notre Dame, Ueberroth told more than 2,300
graduates that volunteerism is a ``hidden asset'' that can be the
best investment a person makes in life.
   ``I encourage everybody here, when you find yourself in a
profession, from the very first day, volunteer,'' said Ueberroth,
who received an honorary doctor of laws degree.
   Doctorow, the author of ``World's Fair'' and other novels, also
advocated volunteerism at Brandeis University's commencement for
700 graduates.
   Among those receiving honorary degrees were New York Times
caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, AIDS researcher Mathilde Krim, New
Republic Editor-in-Chief and alumnus Martin Peretz and pianist
Andre Watts.
   Perez de Cuellar, appearing at Tufts University in Medford,
Mass., near Boston, urged 2,000 graduating seniors to join him in
working for greater world harmony.
   ``All over the world there is now a strong feeling that
international relations have turned a corner and that we are
entering a new era of cooperation among nations,'' he said. ``Even
those who were formerly disheartened are saying that international
conflicts seem to be on their way to solution.''
   In addition to the secretary-general, honorary degrees were
awarded to Academy Award-winning director Bernardo Bertolucci,
Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo and British astrophysicist
and author Stephen Hawking.
   In Providence, R.I., the EPA's top official urged nearly 1,000
Providence College graduates to join a new worldwide commitment to
saving the environment.
   ``We have to invent new ways of managing our relationship with
our environment, going far beyond what we have accomplished during
the last two decades,'' Reilly said.
   ``Increasingly, the world's great cities are choking in
pollution, awash in waste, clogged with automobiles, their rivers
open sewers,'' said Reilly, who received an honorary degree.
   Schroeder, who also picked up an honorary diploma, urged civic
and national pride on about 500 graduates and undergraduates at
Simmons College, a small liberal arts school for women in Boston.
   ``The 1980s has been a decade where the trilogy was me, myself
and I,'' said Schroeder. ``We've got to start thinking about us,
our community, our country and how we are going to compete. There's
never been a time when our country needed you more.''

   A freight train collided with an automobile
at a grade crossing early Sunday, killing the driver and causing 40
cars to derail, state police said.
   The 21-year-old automobile driver was killed when he apparently
tried to out-run the 72-car Burlington Northern freight train at
the crossing northeast of Quincy, said Trooper David Kastel. One
train crewman was treated for minor injuries.
   The dead man, a resident of Quincy, was not identified pending
notification of his relatives. He was alone in the car.
   There was no threat from any hazardous materials and no fire in
the derailment, Kastel said. The damage was estimated to be to be
over $1.25 million.
   Burlington Northern officials were not immediately available for
comment.

   President Raul Alfonsin agreed
Sunday to move up the scheduled Dec. 10 inauguration of
President-elect Carlos Menem because of Argentina's economic crisis.
   But Alfonsin, in a statement, said no date was set after he and
Menem held a daylong meeting with aides.
   The Central Bank meanwhile ordered all banks and foreign
exchange houses closed Monday while the government prepared a new
economic plan that will include price controls and export taxes.
   ``I have said and I repeat, I am not going to flee any
responsibility,'' Alfonsin said late Sunday in a statement read to
reporters by press secretary Jose Ignacio Lopez.
   ``Nevertheless, I note that in the context of a severe economic
crisis, the period of transition is too long,'' Alfonsin said after
meeting with his Cabinet.
   Menem, the Peronist Party leader who won the May 14 presidential
election, told the newspaper Clarin in an interview published
Sunday that he would take office early ``if there is a general
consensus of our entire community.'' He said that would include
business, labor and political groups, the armed forces and leaders
of the the Roman Catholic church.
   In the elections earlier this month the Peronists also won
virtual contol of both houses of Congress.
   Alfonsin's inauguration in December 1983, following elections
that October, ended nearly eight years of military dictatorships.
He was barred by the constitution from seeking a second term.
   Menem defeated Eduardo Angeloz, the Radical Civic Union
candidate.
   Sources in both parties, speaking with the condition they not be
identified, said discussions were being held on how to move up
Menem's inauguration without violating the constitution and if the
new Congress also should be sworn in early.
   Peronist Congressman Eduardo Bauza said Sunday his party is
demanding that Alfonsin's economic team resign. ``They are in great
measure responsible for this crisis,'' he said.
   Bauza also said the transfer of power could be held July 9,
Argentina's independence day. Bauza is considered to be a contender
for finance minister in a Peronist administration.
   The economic situation is putting pressure on both parties.
   Interest has not been paid since last year on the country's $59
billion foreign debt. Menem has said the Central Bank has only $300
million in reserves.
   Economists say the banking system is in jeopardy. They say about
$170 million in bonds fall due this week and banks could have
trouble raising the money.

<HEAD>Indicted Junk Bond King Milken Rallies Shipyard Workers</HEAD>

   When financier Michael Milken addressed
several hundred ex-shipyard workers, few seemed to care that he'd
been indicted in the biggest-ever securities fraud case. For them,
this man was a messianic cheerleader who pledged to help get their
jobs and company back.
   It may have been Milken's high-school cheerleading experience
that helped the junk-bond dealer from Beverly Hills, who delivered
a rousing speech to the crowd at the local Sons of Italy hall.
   His subject was the Fore River Shipyard, which he promised to
help the workers reopen with financing arranged by his former
employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``When the first ship rolls in here on October first, I look
forward to coming back and shaking your hands,'' he said.
   Ever since General Dynamics closed the 182-acre yard three years
ago, workers have dreamed of reopening it as an employee-owned
business.
   The morale-boosting April 27 speech by Milken, principal
defendant in a 98-count securities fraud and racketeering
indictment announced a month earlier, was only the latest twist in
their saga.
   Quincy, a city of 85,000 people south of Boston, has a
century-old tradition of shipbuilding. Old-timers proudly recount
how they turned out the aircraft carriers Wasp and Lexington, the
battleship Massachusetts and the first nuclear powered cruiser, the
USS Long Beach.
   ``It's a family tradition for a lot of us,'' said Arthur Durand,
62. ``I worked there, my father worked there, and my son worked
there. It takes skill and pride to pass it on from generation to
generation _ and it's something we don't want to lose.''
   The yard was founded in 1884 by Dr. John Watson, an assistant to
Alexander Graham Bell, and was managed after World War II by Joseph
Kennedy Sr., father of the late president.
   For the first 75 years, it thrived on innovation as wood gave
way to steel and sails to coal and oil. When the Navy shrank after
1945, the yard began a long decline, slipping from a wartime peak
of 16,000 employees to 5,000 in 1985 and 1,000 when it closed in
May 1986.
   The next year, St. Louis-based General Dynamics sold the yard
and several buildings for $49.5 million to the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority, a quasi-public agency responsible for cleaning
polluted Boston Harbor.
   With support from Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the MWRA began
negotiating a lease with the workers, who formed Massachusetts
Shipbuilders Inc.
   But the workers were frustrated for two years as negotiations
foundered on such issues as hazardous waste liability and the
MWRA's desire to use some of the yard for its own purposes.
   The lease, finally negotiated last October, will allow the
workers to use 70 acres rent-free for two years. After that, the
rent will gradually rise from $100,000 in the third year to $1
million in the seventh.
   To keep the workers' dream alive, the state has pumped nearly
$500,000 into the project. Although most of the former General
Dynamics employees have found new jobs, nearly 1,000 have signed
cards saying they would like to return to work at Fore River.
   Peter Gwyn, a former General Dynamics manager who is president
of Massachusetts Shipbuilders, said he has talked with ship owners
about potential contracts and is optimistic the yard could begin
building and repairing vessels again in October.
   The plan hinges, however, on financing from Drexel, known for
its ability to raise huge amounts of money through the sale of
high-yield debt securities. Commonly known as junk bonds, the
securities are considered riskier for buyers than other forms of
corporate debt.
   Pat Flanagan, a vice president in the investment bank's Boston
office, approached the workers about junk-bond financing last
October, shortly after the lease with the MWRA was signed.
   With Milken's help, Flanagan worked out a $17.3 million package
consisting of $13 million in commercial loans, plus a $3.3 million
investment by Drexel and $1 million from the Massachusetts Capital
Resource Co., a group of insurance companies.
   In return for their investments, Drexel and the insurance group
will receive a 33 percent stake in the shipyard. The remaining 67
percent will go to the workers through an employee stock ownership
plan.
   If the U.S. Economic Development Administration agrees to
guarantee 80 percent of the commercial loans, the financing could
be in place by June 30 and the first workers rehired a few weeks
later.
   Drexel executives say that despite Milken's appearance at the
Sons of Italy hall, he has been no more than a cheerleader on the
sidelines since March, when Drexel agreed to dismiss him as part of
its own deal to settle securities-fraud charges with the government.
   ``Prior to the settlement, Michael was very involved both as a
supporter of the shipyard and as somebody who was intimately
involved in arranging the financing and helping to structure the
transaction,'' Flanagan said.
   But, Flanagan added, ``his role going forward is just as a
supporter _ he has no official role either as adviser or financier
to the shipyard.''
   Nevertheless, some workers still have warm feelings toward the
man considered responsible for helping start a flood of corporate
takeovers that reshaped corporate America in the 1980s.
   ``Once the yard is going again,'' said Durand, ``I'd be glad to
shake his hand.''

   The threat of sanctions under a new U.S. trade law
has pushed some Asian countries to speed up market opening
measures, but also has unleashed counterthreats and claims that the
United States itself isn't a fair trader.
   Asian countries lead the list of 34 nations that U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, in a recent report, said have erected
substantial trade barriers against U.S. products.
   The report was the first step in naming countries Washington
will target for intensive negotiations aimed at eliminating the
trade barriers. A decision on the final list is expected May 30.
   Japan headed the list of alleged trade offenders, followed by
South Korea, Taiwan, India and Malaysia. Other Asian countries
named in the report included China, Indonesia, Pakistan, the
Philippines and Thailand.
   For decades, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan relied on exports to
the United States to fuel their growth into industrial powerhouses.
If they do not reciprocate by opening their markets to U.S.-made
goods, under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act they face possible
retaliation in the form of up to 100 percent tariffs on selected
imports.
   The United States either must increase exports to Asia or slash
its imports from the region in order to substantially cut its trade
deficit.
   Over two-thirds of the $137.34 billion U.S. trade deficit in
1988 was with Asian countries. Acccording to U.S. figures,
America's largest trade imbalance was a $55.4 billion deficit with
Japan.
   The U.S. trade representative's report singles out 32 Japanese
barriers to foreign imports, including rice, supercomputers,
semiconductors, telecommunications and tobacco.
   Japanese officials have responded to the new trade law by
threating to challenge U.S. sanctions under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, the international trade body.
   Japan ``can never accept unilateral actions of the U.S.'' and
would seek mediation under GATT, Japanese economic counselor
Nobutoshi Akao said.
   Tokyo stopped short of such action in 1987 when then-President
Reagan ordered $300 million in annual U.S. penalties against
Japanese electronics products for alleged violation of a 1986
agreement on semiconductor trade. Part of the sanctions have since
been lifted.
   Many Japanese feel their country has done a lot to open its
markets to foreign products and that the United States has not
tried hard enough to sell high-quality products in Japan.
   Some Japanese officials also are angered by U.S. handling of a
recent agreement to jointly produce Japan's next fighter jet. U.S.
congressmen demanded a renegotiation of the pact, charging Tokyo
was using it to acquire U.S. technology, even though it had hoped
to develop the plane alone.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told a press briefing
Thursday that listing Japan as a serious free trade violator could
provoke a strong emotional reaction among the Japanese.
   In some Asian nations, there was little or no public response to
the USTR report, but the reaction in Taiwan and South Korea was
bitter.
   Fearing a strong anti-American backlash, South Korea dispatched
top economic officials to Washington for talks about alleged trade
barriers on agricultural products, telecommunications, government
procurement and financial services.
   South Korea agreed on a new set of import liberalization
measures that officials hoped would prevent penalty sanctions. The
agreement did not include farm imports.
   U.S. retaliation would be seen by the public as ``too harsh,''
said Deputy Prime Minister Soon Cho. ``I'm sure it would be adding
to instability from which the Korean government is already
suffering.''
   There have been sporadic violent clashes between police and
farmers in Korea in recent years as the government gradually opened
its markets to imports of wine, cigarettes, beef and other
products. Anti-American sentiment has grown, fueled by a
dissident-led campaign against U.S. trade pressure.
   Seoul also has threatened to file complaints with GATT and has
refused further devaluation of its currency, the won. A weaker won
makes South Korean products less competitive in overseas markets.
   The United States has accused South Korea and Taiwan of
manipulating their exchange rates to boost their trade surpluses,
although U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said earlier this
month that Taiwan has made progress in that area.
   The USTR report charges Taiwan with unfair import licensing,
farm subsidies and ineffective protection of intellectual property
rights.
   Taiwanese officials responded they had done much to liberalize
the local market and narrow the nation's trade gap with the United
States.
   ``It is extremely unfair to include us in the report,'' said
Vincent Siew, vice chairman of the government's Council for
Economic Planning and Development.
   In March, Taiwan presented a four-year timetable for reducing
its U.S. trade surplus by at least 10 percent annually. The surplus
totaled $10.4 billion last year, down 35 percent from 1987.
   In April, Taiwan announced tariff cuts on hundreds of items and
said it would revise laws on insurance and banking and crack down
on pirate videos. It has refused, however, to further open its
agricultural market, saying it must protect local farmers.
   India, charged with unfair import policies, export subsidies and
poor protection of intellectual property rights, countered by
saying the U.S. threats violate GATT rules.
   Commerce Minister Dinesh Singh called the 1988 Trade Act unfair
and said India would pursue the issue to protect its interests.
   Thailand and Malaysia also objected to the threat of U.S. trade
sanctions.
   Bangkok, which enjoyed a $1.4 billion surplus with the United
States in 1988, is under fire for inadequate protection of U.S.
pharmaceutical patents. It asked for more time to deal with the
problem and in turn accused Washington of unfair farm subsidies.
   A Foreign Ministry official who demanded anonymity said Thailand
had its own complaints against U.S. agriculture subsidies. The
Americans ``are subsidizing their 11,000 rice farmers by up to $1
billion a year, whereas Thailand has millions of rice farmers who
are very poor and cannot sell their rice because of subsidies,'' he
said.
   In Malaysia, the pro-government New Straits Times also
criticized the U.S. accusations of unfair trade barriers in
agricultural products, especially palm oil, Malaysia's main export
to the United States.
   Malaysia posted a $1.7 billion trade surplus with the United
States last year.

<HEAD>Exxon Credit Card Customers Returning Cards by Thousands</HEAD>

   For the past two months, employees at Exxon
Corp.'s Credit Card Center have been under a state of siege as
angry customers _ including more than 17,000 who canceled their
accounts _ vehemently protested the Alaskan oil spill.
   Workers at the credit card center here are wearing special
gloves to handle protest letters purposedly soaked with oil. They
spend hours piecing together torn-up credit cards in order to
determine the account numbers that customers want canceled. They
apologize on behalf of their company dozens of times a day.
   ``There are mornings when I don't want to go to work,'' Barbara
Domino said. ``I just tell myself I can't let it get to me.''
   Many of the returned credit cards are torn to shreds, covered in
oil or burned. They also are accompanied by notes reading, ``You
ought to be hung'' for the March 24 oil spill in Prince William
Sound.
   The crisis is taking its toll throughout the Exxon organization.
   Employees, confronted daily by criticisms of Exxon in the media
and by friends and family members, are questioning their faith in
the corporate giant.
   ``It's been deeply painful for every employee that I've worked
with, talked with and met,'' said Larry Stockman, a psychologist on
retainer with Exxon. ``They feel devastated by what's happened.''
   A week and a half into the crisis, one of the women at the card
center hung up after a call from an enraged customer and started to
cry. One by one, her office mates started crying as well. Her
supervisor, Joyce Jackson, stood amid them, handing out tissues.
   ``It'd been building up all week,'' Ms. Jackson said.
   Stockman said employees are ``embarrassed, they're hurt, they're
sad. Some are angry, but that passes because they don't know who to
be angry with. It's like a death.''
   The company has taken steps to maintain its employees'
confidence. At Exxon's downtown building, videos presenting
management's side of the story are shown throughout the day.
   Despondent employees have come up with their own morale
boosters. Employees of the shipping company said they were being
shunned not only by the public but by Exxon employees from other
divisions. So they printed up buttons proclaiming, ``I Work for
Exxon Shipping and I'm proud of it.''
